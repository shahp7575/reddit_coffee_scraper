1l4c1dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l4c1dn/i_dated_a_man_11_years_older_he_ruined_my_20s_and/,I dated a man 11 years older. He ruined my 20s — and now he wants cash,"I’m going to call him Michael — not his real name.

I met Michael two years ago when I was 19 and he was 30. We worked at the same place — I was an operator, he was technically my supervisor (a senior manager). We started dating, and within two months he was pushing hard for us to move in together. I owned my own house (long story), so I offered that he could come stay over for a day. Well… that “day” turned into two years of hell.

He said he needed to go get some things from his place. I offered to come along. At first, he didn’t want me to — said it was messy, he had to clean, etc. But I went anyway. That’s when I found out… he’d been living with his ex the entire time. I met her. Awkward? Horrifying. He told me they were just roommates and she was supporting him because he hadn’t had a real job in a long time. He swore they didn’t sleep together. I believed him.

Later she was texting him asking when he’d be back and begging him to return. I told him he was full of crap and that he should just go back to her. But he begged me to stay — said he loved me and only me. I believed him again.

At work, he just sipped coffee and joked with his colleagues while I worked 12-hour shifts. Nobody at work even knew we were together — he seemed embarrassed of me. At home, I cleaned, cooked, did laundry, made his lunches, prepped his reports and even helped with his job. He never helped with anything. And if I didn’t do things his way, he’d criticize me. On weekends, he made up chores for me: shoveling snow, painting fences in the heat, planting flowers he picked out but never touched again.

Then came my birthday. I knew he was planning to propose because I’d overheard him talking to his friends about the ring. But honestly, I was scared.

Backstory: my dad is in the military and I rarely see him. Right before my birthday, he got a day off, so we went to the lake, ate pizza, laughed a lot — I wore a dress I hadn’t had a chance to wear in forever (because Michael never took me anywhere). When I got home, Michael accused me of cheating… with my dad. Because I called my dad “daddy.” He got drunk, screamed at me, trashed the kitchen, and threw the ring at me saying I “cheated” and he couldn’t marry a “slut.”

The next day was my birthday. I canceled the party I had planned and told friends I was sick. I was devastated. But then… he invited his friends over and threw me a party with people I didn’t know. I just sat there while he drank and laughed with them. My gift? Live butterflies that died in a week.

Later, I asked if he could just get me flowers sometimes — just something simple. He gave me a cheap silver bracelet, then screamed at me for not reacting “happy enough.” He wanted me to jump for joy, but it just felt like a pity gesture.

Then came his birthday. I still did everything — organized a party, made a cake, gave him a gift he wanted (an engraving tool). He still said I was ruining his life.

I was going to leave him after that… but when I brought it up, he started crying like a baby and threatened to drive his car into a wall. So I stayed.

Things got worse. Now he was playing video games all day, doing literally none of the housework. When I asked him to help, he’d scream at me: call me trash, tell me to die, call me a whore, a bitch, a mistake — every fight ended with insults and me in tears.

Once I told a friend how exhausted I was. He found out and accused me of damaging his “reputation.” I eventually quit that job and took a new one — same level as him. He mocked me and said I wouldn’t last. He never praised me, never had my back in front of others.

We live in a country at war. Men over 25 are subject to conscription. He got drafted. He demanded I find a way to get him out of it. I didn’t. I knew life would be easier without him.

But still, for 4 months I visited him every weekend at his base, brought him supplies. He always complained. One day he slapped my hands because the hat I brought was the wrong color. That was the final straw.

I quit my job and returned to my old workplace — to his former position. I’d earned it. A month later, I got promoted even higher. At 21, I outranked him. He couldn’t handle it. When I told him, he said I’d never manage it and would be fired. When he found out about my promotion… he blocked me on everything.

Oh, and he always blocked me after fights — every time. No explanation, just gone.

If anyone’s interested, I can post an update. Because now? He’s asking me for money.",1,1749161065.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1l4c1dc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l4c1dc/i_went_to_a_concert_whilst_having_a_fit_note_for/,I went to a concert whilst having a fit note for work,"I work in a chain coffee shop, I have for around 3 years, different stores though. I am a shift leader and very experienced, my Area Manager has always praised me for good work.

Recently I had extreme abdominal pain, we haven’t quite gotten to the bottom of anything but the doctors have said it’s to do with my ovaries, at the start it was cysts then it progressed to a bit more and we had the potential talk of removal of my ovary/ovaries. I’m 21, hoping to have kids one day and this was devastating to hear.

I was signed off by my doctor due to the pain and everything going on, I was off for 12 days with a fit note. I worked for 2 days after coming back from holiday in pain, it was sore whenever i laughed, coughed, sneezed or even lifting something heavy - like a tray of coffees.

The pain died down eventually as I was on a shit ron of meds and pain relief. I started to feel a whole lot better so my partner and I on the Friday before I returned to work on the Wednesday decided to go to a concert we had spent hundreds on months before. I fainted during the concert and had what we believe, a seizure. Clearly I wasn’t okay as I thought.

I did post this on my social media, I had nothing to hide, i also let my friends know that i work with what had happened during the gig and how awful i felt. The weekend went by and we did have another concert lined up after my fit note had finished and it was just a normal day off from work before returning after being off.

I felt better but cautious and anxious but my partner reassured me he was there with me and i would be okay. I was fine during this one, had a blast, stayed more 1000x more hydrated than i did at the last one.

On my first day back my manager pulls me into the office and jumps down my neck about going to concerts whilst being off. I get it, it does look bad, however i was not breaching my fit note. My manager has only been focusing on the abdominal pain rather than all the other things i’ve let her know, my mental health was a factor of not going to work, the constant trips to the hospital also.

My friend, that i work with, had informed her of me going out but failed to mention my fainting/seizure, so my manager was pretty shocked she knew half a story. Manager told me i have to apologise to this friend as they CHOSE to pick my shifts off that i could not come in for.

Please bear in mind, no is always an answer, multiple other members of staff said no. We have the option of closing early.

I also found out that my manager and team members have been telling regular customers that i have been off enjoying my time and going to concerts, implying that i am not unwell. It was awkward hearing customers ask how i enjoyed my fabulous time away when in reality it was fucking traumatic for me.

I’ve never been so terrified and had so many people touch me somewhere to private and intimate to me. I’ve had the hardest month of my life, including being assaulted by a customer a week and a half before everything.

Do i need to apologise? I didn’t think I was wrong for enjoying something after being through something so traumatising, something that will continue to be traumatic for the foreseeable future. My manager has been threatening me with disciplinaries and has mentioned the fact i could lose my job, however, HR has said I was covered fully by my fit note.

They’ve created an awkward atmosphere for me to come back to, it’s been an incredibly hard few days back on top of the worst month ever.

Are they in the right to be informing customers wrong information? Why not just say I was off for a while, is it that difficult?",1,1749161064.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

His latest launch just hit our boutique — and it’s a full-on **gourmand quartet** that smells like a pastry chef’s fantasy.

These four extrait de parfums are like walking through the dreamiest dessert menu you never knew you needed in your collection. Here’s the breakdown:

**1.** [**Marzipan Gourmand**](https://parfumexquis.com/products/marzipan-gourmand?variant=46682120126720) Soft, nutty, and indulgent. This perfume wraps you in the sweet warmth of **almond paste**, sugar-dusted confections, and that slightly chewy, almost toasty marzipan feel. If you love almond-forward gourmands like Hypnotic Poison or Lira, this feels like their cozier, more edible cousin. It’s creamy without being cloying and finishes with a vanillic-musky smoothness that’s addictive.

**2.** [**Peach Macaron**](https://parfumexquis.com/products/peach-macaron?variant=46672244932864) Imagine biting into a sun-ripened peach and then following it with a rosewater-glazed macaron. That’s this perfume. The peach is juicy but soft, not sharp or synthetic, and the creamy almond-macaron accord underneath makes it feel like you’re wearing a pastel dessert. Feminine, flirty, and very French-pâtisserie-chic.

**3.** [**Matcha Ice Cream**](https://parfumexquis.com/products/matcha-ice-cream?variant=46672290414848) This one is for the green tea lovers who want a twist on the usual sweet scents. You get the grassy, slightly bitter edge of **matcha**, blended beautifully with **rice milk** and a mellow **vanilla bean** heart. It’s smooth, refreshing, and wearable—even for those who shy away from full-on gourmands. Think minimalist matcha latte, in fragrance form.

**4.** [**Tiramisu**](https://parfumexquis.com/products/tiramisu?variant=46672230973696) YES. It’s as good as it sounds. This one is deep, dark, and a little boozy thanks to **coffee liqueur** top notes. The heart is creamy **mascarpone** and sponge cake, dusted with **cocoa powder** and wrapped in **tonka bean**. It manages to be sexy and edible at the same time. Not overly sweet—there’s that bitter espresso depth that makes it more niche than novelty.

---

All four are **extrait de parfum**, so they wear close but last like a dream. They’re perfect for layering (hello _Peach Macaron + Matcha Ice Cream_) or just basking in solo.

Available now at [**Parfum Exquis**](https://parfumexquis.com) (we’re the official distributor of Kalotinis). Which one are you craving most? 🍮🍑🍵☕ Would love to hear if you’ve tried them or what you’d pair them with!",1,1749161004.0,u_parfumexquis,0,1.0,False

We met on a jobsite and just knew that we were each other's person. Please don't comment about our age difference. He is the Love of my Life. We lost a child 5 years ago come October and now we have a beautiful daughter. I also have PPA (Postpartum Anxiety) from losing my first child.



Now onto what is going on. I'm a SAHM with our beautiful daughter. My husband has to work out of town for work. I understand the stress and the loneliness of working on the road because I worked at the same company he did. When I found out that I was pregnant I was running a HDD (Horizontal Directional Drill) putting in natural gas pipeline. When Jerome comes home all he does is drink his beer and do whatever he wants to. When he is at the hotel every night, he drinks his beer and hangs out with people he just meets or listens to music. All while I do everything with our daughter. I don't leave the house because we live paycheck to paycheck. I don't take our child to his father's house because we both don't trust his stepmother. I have been overwhelmed for some time now and I try not to let it show. On the weekends Jerome will wake up, fix his coffee, smoke a cigarette, then nap on the couch until 2-4 pm. All while I'm taking care of our daughter, making sure her diapers are changed, giving snacks and drinks, and naptime. Jerome wakes up he complains about how tired he is then gets dressed and starts drinking beer. When we first got together he told me that he drinks beer and if I had a problem with that then we weren't meant for each other. I have never minded him drinking and he is a very loving and attentive father. I do everything for him from washing dishes, washing his clothes for work, and making supper. I went and hung out with my friend/ neighbor this past weekend so she could get some organizing done. Jerome will not change a poopy diaper and I understand his point of view on it. He messaged me to come change our child's diaper so I did. He them got upset that I was over there for as long as I was. I was next door for approximately an hour and a half. I feel like I can't have a break from my own child. I am constantly overstimulated but Jerome doesn't think I should show it. He thinks that it is all in my head when I get upset or just need a break. I am in the same 4 walls day in and day out. I know his job isn't a break for him but at the same time I wish he would step up more at the house.

Okay, Reddit, I need your judgment. I'm at my wit's end with my roommate, ""Liam."" For months now, Liam has been systematically eating my food. Not just a little bit, but entire meals I've prepped for the week, snacks I bought, even my fancy coffee creamer. I've tried everything: talking to him (he denies it), labeling my food (he ""doesn't see the labels""), even hiding stuff (he finds it). I'm a student working part-time, and I can't afford to buy groceries for two people. My budget is tight, and his thievery was seriously impacting my ability to eat properly.
This week, I was particularly low on funds, and I had planned out my meals meticulously. I bought a really nice loaf of bread and some good quality deli meat for sandwiches. I made myself one for lunch, and left the rest in the fridge. Lo and behold, the next morning, half the loaf and most of the deli meat were GONE. I was furious. This was my last straw.
So, I decided to get creative. I bought a packet of tasteless laxatives. I made a new sandwich – a really tempting-looking one – and sprinkled the entire packet of laxatives between the cheese and the meat. I left it in a prominent spot in the fridge, almost daring him.
Sure enough, when I got home from class later that day, the sandwich was gone. About an hour later, I started hearing... noises... from the bathroom. Distinctive, urgent noises. This went on for a long time. When Liam finally emerged, he looked absolutely awful. Pale, sweaty, and avoiding eye contact. He mumbled something about having a ""stomach bug"" and spent the rest of the evening huddled in his room.
Now, part of me feels a little bad. He looked genuinely miserable. But another part of me feels incredibly satisfied. This was my last resort. I don't know if he knows why he's sick, but he definitely knows he's sick.
So, AITA for giving my food-stealing roommate a laxative sandwich ?

TLDR: My roommate kept stealing my food, so I baked him a laxative-laced sandwich. He ate it, and now he's been in the bathroom all night.

1l4brnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/KellyClarkson/comments/1l4brnc/facts_about_kelly_clarkson/,Facts about Kelly Clarkson,"She’s of Greek (one eighth), English, German, Irish, Scottish and Welsh descent

She explored her heritage when she appeared on TLC's ancestry-themed series Who Do You Think You Are?. She was excited to discover that her great-great-great-grandfather, Isaiah Rose, was a Civil War veteran who became a sheriff, then a Republican Ohio State Senator in 1906. ""I could not be more proud of this man,"" the singer said as she leafed through historical documents detailing Rose's service, including his time as a prisoner of war.

She became a coach on The Voice in 2018. It went so well, she got her own daytime talk show, The Kelly Clarkson Show, the following year.

Clarkson belted out ""My Country, 'Tis Of Thee"" at President Obama's 2013 inauguration, but it was Beyonce's ""The Star Spangled Banner"" that drew more media attention. While Clarkson gave a passionate live performance, Beyoncé (eventually) admitted she lip-synched hers, which Clarkson thought was completely understandable.

When asked for her opinion about the controversy, she told Nashvillegab It really didn't matter to me; take it from a girl that has stood there. It's the most nerve-wracking environment I've ever been in. Everything in your heart and soul is praying to God that you don't mess up. 

And why is it, because that event isn't about me or Beyoncé or James Taylor, we're just the jazz hands on the side. It's about the President and it's a historical event and it's about our country. I could totally see why someone wouldn't want to mess that up and pre-tape it.""

As for the practice of lip-synching, Clarkson confided that she's never done it so far because she's terrified something will go wrong, like ""the track would skip.""

Clarkson joined Reba McEntire's family when she married the country singer's stepson, Brandon Blackstock, on October 20, 2013. McEntire's husband, Narvel Blackstock, was Clarkson's manager at the time. Along with the nuptials came two stepchildren - daughter Savannah and son Seth - from Brandon's previous marriage. They had two children together before Kelly filed for divorce on June 4, 2020. Songs like ""I Hate Love"" on her 2023 album Chemistry are a reaction to their split.

In 2012, Clarkson nearly became the envy of every Jane Austen fan when she bid on a rare piece of the author's jewelry at a Sotheby's auction in London. The singer was willing to pay over $230,000 for a turquoise and gold ring she hoped to use as her engagement ring, but the British government wasn't ready to part with the item without a fight. Culture minister Ed Vaizey pleaded with potential UK buyers to claim the ""national treasure"" for the nation. Someone listened and anonymously bid against Clarkson and won. As a consolation, her husband (then fiancé) had a replica made for her.

The production of Clarkson's third album, My December, was rife with controversy. Gossip rags caught wind of a feud between the singer and music mogul Clive Davis, who was then the head of Sony-BMG, and gathered every scathing quote and juicy tidbit they could. Davis feared the darker tone of the album would affect sales and even wanted Clarkson to eschew her own original songs for lighter pop covers to make the record more commercial. Clarkson dug in her heels and refused to alter her work (and rightfully so - it was certified Platinum).

After the album's release in June, 2007, she downplayed the conflict on her website, stating, ""Much of this has been blown way out of proportion and taken out of context. Contrary to recent characterizations in the press, I'm well aware that Clive is one of the great record men of all time. He has been a key advisor and has been an important force in my success to date.""

Contrary, indeed, to her own words. She made it perfectly clear in an earlier interview with USA Weekend that she didn't include Davis as part of her professional family: ""I'm going to be real honest with you: I am not a fan. I do respect him [Clive Davis], but I don't want to barbecue with him. We don't braid each other's hair. And despite the rumors, he is nowhere near a father figure.""

The Beatles' fandom took a crushing blow in 2002 when Clarkson's debut single,"" A Moment Like This,"" beat the band's 38-year-old record of a single's biggest leap to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. ""Can't Buy Me Love"" jumped from #27 to #1 in 1964, while ""A Moment Like This"" rocketed from #52 to the top in its second week. 

Since then, the record has been broken numerous times (changes in eligibility have made it an easier feat), but Clarkson secured the title again with a whopping jump from #97 with ""My Life Would Suck Without You"" in 2009.

Remember when the shark in Jaws tore into Robert Shaw until blood gushed out of his screaming mouth? Kelly Clarkson does, too. She blames the Spielberg movie for ruining her dream of becoming a marine biologist (someone should tell her the marine biologist, played by Richard Dreyfuss, survived in the end).

Growing up in Burleson, Texas, she had a number of odd jobs. She worked at Eckerd drug store, a movie theater, and a comedy club (where she was a waitress). One of her favorite gigs was doing promotions for Red Bull - she would drive around giving away the energy drinks.

As a teenager, she performed at the theme park Six Flags Over Texas. She had made a demo tape and dreamed of moving to New York or Los Angeles to pursue a career in music, and she got that opportunity in 2001 when a girl she was working with moved to LA and needed a roommate. Her dreams were crushed when she went broke, but after returning to Texas, she auditioned for a new show called American Idol, which worked out well for her.

When she first moved to Los Angeles, she worked as an extra - you might be able to spot her in the background on episodes of Dharma & Greg and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.

Kelly Clarkson is the first American Idol contestant to score 100 #1s on Billboard's national domestic music charts, current, recurrent and catalog. She achieved this milestone when ""Piece by Piece"" jumped to the top of Digital Songs and Pop Digital Songs chart in March 2016.

Clarkson started writing songs because she had trouble communicating when she was younger. Her mom asked her to start journaling, and she found herself writing poems that she turned into music. ""That's how I would process my feelings,"" she explained.

She revealed during a special show for SiriusXM listeners at New York City's Highline Ballroom that Brandon Blackstock was the first man she was ""sexually attracted"" to. Previous boyfriends didn't excite her.

""I honestly thought I was asexual,"" she noted, before adding that everything changed for her when she met Brandon. ""

I'd never been turned on like that in my whole life,"" she gushed. ""I was like, 'Oh that's that feeling... okay! That's what they were talking about in Waiting to Exhale.' I just got it. I just didn't have a clue.""

Clarkson didn't want to finish first on American Idol because the winner was contractually bound to make a musical rom-com, and she knew she was ""no Meryl Streep."" After she was declared the champ, Clarkson pleaded to be relieved from the contractual obligation to star in a film, but she couldn't get out of it. 

The American Idol winner's fears were realized. The film Clarkson made, From Justin to Kelly, was panned by the critics and won the Golden Raspberry Award for ""Worst 'Musical' of Our First 25 Years"" in 2005.

Clarkson portrayed the singer Brenda Lee on American Dreams, a nostalgic TV series set in the 1960s; she performed Lee's enduring Christmas staple ""Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree"" and her hit ""Sweet Nothin's.""

Clarkson was thrilled to step into a legend's shoes, but she initially had a different legend in mind: jazz and pop singer Rosemary Clooney, whom she calls her ""all-time favorite performer."" After recording the show, though, she had a new appreciation for Lee. She told Soundspike My mom told me about Brenda Lee and I got to know a lot more about her when I did the show. She's very cool. She was very Rock. She started out doing country and then she got real rock. That was cool.""

Kelly hates the sound of her speaking voice so much, she won't leave voice mails.

Clarkson won her first Grammy Awards in 2006 (Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for ""Since U Been Gone""; Best Pop Vocal Album for Breakaway). She also performed ""Because Of You"" on the show, but under extreme duress.

I was called right as I was leaving for the Grammys and was told I had cancerous results,"" she said on Conan O'Brien's podcast in 2023. ""The next morning, I called back to schedule an appointment, and they said, 'We're so sorry. Those were actually someone else's results.'""

Despite being widely regarded as a pop star, Kelly Clarkson was once told during a lunch meeting with industry insiders that if she didn't abandon pop music and go fully into country, her music wouldn't be played on country radio. As much as she loves country music - having grown up with it in Texas and even releasing a duet with Vince Gill - Kelly chose to stay true to her genre-hopping style, rejecting the idea of being pigeonholed into one genre. Ironically, she's often introduced as a ""country music superstar"" despite never having released a country album!

Voice 
Critics have said Clarkson has a soprano voice.

Arion Berger of Rolling Stone wrote that ""her high notes are sweet and pillowy, her growl is bone-shaking and sexy, and her mid-range is amazingly confident.""

In reviewing a live performance of Clarkson's, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said she ""showed off a voice that moved in all sorts of ways, without ever appearing to strain"", continuing ""Ms. Clarkson, who has a malleable voice and a boatload of vocal confidence, might be a soul siren in the making"". 

However, in a separate review of Stronger, Caramanica said Clarkson's voice is ""too huge, too violent"" for warmer and sweeter vocal stylings, stating ""she's on a par with Taylor Swift when it comes to vengeance, and she'll do it louder and with more brutality in comparison to her contemporary.""

In a live review as part of her Stronger Tour, Sophie Sinclair of Hit The Floor said ""Kelly's strong and powerful voice was flawless throughout the night, and some may even say she sounds better live than she does on her albums"".

Mark Deming from Phoenix New Times stated that ""in an era when pop music means over-singing a song into a bloody pulp, Clarkson has consistently displayed both charisma and a welcome sense of restraint, knowing how to sound passionate and heartfelt without forgetting where the melody and the root note is supposed to go.""

Dr. Luke, who produced some of Clarkson's hits, said ""She has powerful lungs. She's like the Lance Armstrong of vocal cords.""

In an interview with Good Morning America, Simon Cowell was asked of the then six American Idol winners, who he thought had the best voice. Cowell immediately answered that Clarkson did ""by a mile"", noting that she was ""up there"" with other great singers such as Celine Dion.

Esquire wrote that Clarkson has ""the best voice in the history of pop music"".

Reviewing Stronger, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone states, Clarkson has ""one of music's most remarkable voices.""

Jason Lipshutz from Billboard considered Clarkson as one of the greatest singers in pop music

Regarding the controversial practice of lip-syncing, Clarkson says she never has and never will lip-sync, elaborating in an interview with Cory Myers, ""I've actually never done that because I'm terrified; if I ever did that, something horrible would happen, the track would skip. I have a really unhealthy fear about it. So no, I've never done that"".

Clarkson has earned the title ""Queen of Covers"" for her ability to perform songs from artists of various genres.

Influences 
At age eight, Clarkson was first inspired to venture into music during a visit to an African-American church in Fort Worth, Texas. She recalled: ""I was like, 'Wow, whatever they're feeling, I want to feel it too'.""

Clarkson has been influenced by musicians across various genres. She cited soul singer Aretha Franklin as her major influence. Many of her chosen Idol numbers were Aretha Franklin covers, including ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"", which is considered her breakout moment during the competition.

Other soul acts who influenced Clarkson were Whitney Houston,Mariah Carey, Etta James and Stevie Wonder.

Clarkson was also influenced by Christina Aguilera,by rock acts such as Radiohead, Garbage, Aerosmith, and Jimi Hendrix,as well as Reba McEntire, Bette Midler, and Rosemary Clooney.

Regarding her musical influence, Clarkson explained:

I grew up with three totally different parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis and all that kind of stuff. And my real father is into Whitney and Mariah, and Aretha, all those soulful singers. 

My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra Streisand,Bette Midler, all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like ten years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.

Clarkson often covers rock songs on her Kellyoke segment of her talk show, such as Metallica's 'Sad But True', and Heart's 'Crazy On You'.

Impact
The talent show just gives you your 15 minutes. It gives you the chance to be seen on television. It's what you do afterwards that really counts. A lot of people just want to be famous. If that's your goal, it's not going to be long term. Anyone can be famous. It's called YouTube.

—Clarkson on her career longevity.

Clarkson has scored over 100 number ones on the Billboard charts and sold over 25 million albums and 45 million singles worldwide,including 14 million albums and 35 million digital singles in the United States alone.

She became the first artist to top each of Billboard's pop, adult contemporary, adult pop, country and dance charts.

She was ranked nineteenth on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Women in Music. 

Television channel Fuse included Clarkson among ""30 Greatest Musicians to Come From Singing Competitions"" list.

Music executive Simon Cowell believed that ""What Clarkson sold in the UK, Europe, Asia had nothing to do with American Idol. It had everything to do with the fact that she made a great record and she's got an incredible voice. She's not a girl who got lucky in a talent competition; we got lucky to find her.""

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Clarkson is ""the embodiment of the perfect pop star. Her unmistakable pipes are a powerful presence in top 40 and country, with forays into anthemic rock and dance.""

Nolan Feeney from Time asserted that Clarkson ""has had more of a lasting impact on the pop music landscape than casual listeners might realize.""

According to Billboard, Clarkson was a ""phenomenon"" who ""helped legitimize"" the impact of talent shows.

The Washington Post wrote that ""Clarkson's powerhouse voice and dynamic presence signaled that the music industry should take these reality show contestants seriously: Her first two albums, Thankful and Breakaway, sold about ten million copies combined, and her pop tunes became empowerment anthems across the globe.""

Glenn Gamboa of Newsday believed Clarkson ""has set the standard for all singing competition contestants with her savvy mix of pop, rock and country.""

Fox Broadcasting Company said that Clarkson gave ""lasting credibility"" to American Idol and ""in so many ways she cleared a road"" for all of the next contestants.""

George Varga from The San Diego Union-Tribune underlined the difference of Clarkson from most other talent show contestants is that she ""writes or co-writes a fair number of her own songs. She is also the only one whose quest to follow her artistic instincts—the better to rock out and break free from the Idol cookie-cutter pop mold—prompted her to fire her management team and engage in a prolonged public battle with her record company, RCA.""

Jon Lisi from PopMatters cited Clarkson as one of the forces of female domination in pop music of the 2000s. Mickey Rapkin of Billboard magazine, who called Clarkson a role model and compared her vocals to golden-era Aretha Franklin, stated that Clarkson ""has never shied away from speaking her mind, whether in her propulsive pop anthems or on her filter-free Twitter feed.""

Clarkson has been an influence on other artists, including Vanessa Hudgens,Demi Lovato,Ava Max,Jordin Sparks,Ashley Tisdale,Avril Lavigne,as well as country music singers such as Kelsea Ballerini and Priscilla Block.

In February 2012, Clarkson began dating talent manager Brandon Blackstock, son of her former manager Narvel Blackstock and former stepson of Reba McEntire.

She and Blackstock married on October 20, 2013, at Blackberry Farm in Walland, Tennessee.

During their marriage, Brandon was her manager.

Together, they have a daughter River, born in June 2014 and a son, Remington ""Remy"" born in April 2016.

In June 2020, Clarkson filed for divorce from Blackstock, citing irreconcilable differences.

In March 2022, it was reported their divorce had been finalized.

In February 2022, Clarkson officially changed her legal name to Kelly Brianne. In an interview, she revealed the name change was for her personal life, while her public name would remain the same. Clarkson stated the reason behind her name change was due to a strained relationship with her late father.

On November 21, 2023, Clarkson was awarded more than $2.6 million from her ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, for commissions paid to him for business deals he procured as her manager. The California Labor Commissioner ruled that Blackstock violated the state's Talent Agencies Act by handling these deals, which should have been managed by Clarkson's talent agents at Creative Artists Agency. The ruling included commissions from Clarkson's role on The Voice and other promotional agreements, but did not require repayment for deals related to The Kelly Clarkson Show.

In October 2019, Clarkson said that she has been managing an autoimmune condition and a thyroid condition since 2006,which she had previously addressed on Today in 2018.

Philanthropy
In April 2007, Clarkson took part in ""Idol Gives Back"", a fundraiser for people in poverty in both Africa and the U.S., performing ""Up to the Mountain"" along with the late Jeff Beck.

She would also perform a five-song set later that year on the American leg of Live Earth concerts opting for environmental awareness about climate change. She has served as ambassador for the March of Dimes since she was on American Idol, raising money regularly and assisting in volunteer service, having walked for ""March for Babies"", for the cause of improvement of the health of mothers and babies.

Clarkson, additionally, got involved in the organization ""Houses of Hope"", who take care and build orphanages for children in South Africa who have been affected by HIV/AIDS, abuse and poverty.

She has visited those children and also participated in ""A Night for Hope"" fund-raiser concert (held by Clarkson's background vocal singers, Jill and Kate), where she performed a song she wrote after her trip to South Africa, ""You Still Won't Know What It's Like"". Clarkson also supports the charities Save the Children, UNICEF, ""Do Something"" and ""STOMP Out Bullying"" and music causes like the Save the Music Foundation.

Clarkson had a ranch in Texas for unwanted animals, which included amputee goats, blind dogs, and horses that survived colic; there are more than 80 animals at the sanctuary. She helped provide veterinary care for them and found them an adoptive family.

Clarkson performed in a benefit concert on March 1, 2013, supporting the Omaha based Opportunity Education Foundation, an organization that provides access to education for children around the world, stating ""Education was a key part of my childhood, and I am better for it. Anything for education I am really into and especially for kids. A lot of people don't have computers, and they can't afford them. Without education, you get far behind. As long as they have a chance, you know, I think that's important. I want every kid to have a chance.""

In 2013, Clarkson teamed up with State Farm Insurance to support teen safe driving as a part of Celebrate My Drive program.

In 2013, Clarkson supported Feeding America, The Ad Council and their Child Hunger PSA Campaign, which provides food for children facing hunger.

1l4bpcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcotarShipDebateSub/comments/1l4bpcu/theory_bryce_is_the_little_mermaid_azriel_is/,Theory: Bryce is The Little Mermaid & Azriel is Prince Eric,"This post delves into The Little Mermaid (TLM), The Ocean Queen, Nesta and Bryce's return to eventual return to Prythian and to Azriel. I know many folks equate Gwyn to Ariel because of her 1/4 Nymph blood and red hair, but I'm here to explain my theory as to why Bryce is TLM.

# The Little Mermaid

So we all know the story of the red head from under the sea, who wants to be a part of Eric's world. When she gets her legs and ends up on land, she lost her voice and she can't communicate with Eric. But they are able to talk via body language.

[Although they don't understand each other via speech, they read each other's body language](https://preview.redd.it/8onfnw0ky55f1.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df7594842d631694229cf40da9ce18f6f5c9e8d)

# Bryce is Ariel

* Red hair
* Is a Princess
* From another world
* Her nickname is ""LEGS"", from Tharion
* Has fish friends AKA Tharion
* When she comes to Prythian, she can't communicate but Azriel reads her body language
* In the Bloomsbury HOFAS pinned video, what kind of cup does Sarah have on her desk? A Little Mermaid coffee cup.
* We also have the quote below from Sarah mentioning how she wants to incorporate TLM.

# The Ocean Queen: A Foretelling

In CC3, when Bryce Quinlan returned from the original Fae Homeworld, the Ocean Queen immediately proposed that she use the power of the Horn to open a gateway back to that world as a refuge and grant passage to allow as many of her people to escape the Asteri's clutches.

Midgard originally belonged to the Mer and the Humans. The last book of CC is House of Many Waters. Will we see a flooding Ragnorok (Twilight of the Gods) of Midgard which would prompt Bryce to provide refuge out of Midgard to Prythian. Which takes us to Nesta

# Nesta: Her New Tattoo and Stewardess of Dusk

1. In WAR, Nesta wanted to provide a SAFE HARBOR for the human during the war
2. Then at the end of Silver Flames, Nesta makes a bargain with The Mother and she gets a new tattoo. The wording in the scene is as follows: **"" it splashed across her back.....like a crashing wave""**
3. Bryce gave Nesta the Starsword/Gwydion, this may have been symbolic of ""deal with dusk for now and find some answers"". Perhaps Nesta will be a stewardess for Dusk until Bryce returns.
4. Bryce and Nesta have the potential to be BFF. Again, Bryce gave Nesta the sword, not Azriel.

“So we’re obviously destined to be best friends,” Bryce teased.

“Nesta laughed again. ‘If you weren’t our captive,’ she said shaking her head, ‘I think I might like to call you a friend, Bryce Quinlan.’”

Bryce with Nesta's help will provide a refuge of safe harbor in the Dusk Court to flee the flooding of Midgard (Ragnorok). She will leave her world and become truly part of a new world, Prythian. Will she also maybe save her Prince Eric aka Azriel?

# Azriel: A Prince Who Needs Saving?

In TLM, Prince Eric becomes under a spell from an evil sea with Ursula. Via a luring siren song voice. She also has a desire for the Trident, a mighty weapon to command the seas. Ariel saves Prince Eric, and together they ultimately defeat Ursula.

In Silver Flames, we learn two things about Koschei:

1. He wants ALL 4 dread trove items (weapons of immense power)
2. He said he's been preparing for Azriel

Why Azriel specifically? Does the wind talk to him like it did the Bone Carver? Will Koschei cast an enchantment or trap on Azriel? Is he targeting Azriel to lure Bryce to him with the horn, the 4th trove item?

This could prompt Bryce and Nesta to use Gwydion/Truth-Teller/Ataraxia/Dread Trove to kill Koschei a death god, like she had the Asteri. Saving Azriel.

1l4bofv,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterford/comments/1l4bofv/an_post_is_tracking_the_only_reliable_option/,An Post - is tracking the only reliable option?,"10 days ago I posted a package to my Dad in Kerry for his birthday. A new t shirt and socks and some coffee beans. I wasn’t going to be back home before his birthday so I thought posting would be a good idea. It wasn’t a high value package so I didn’t get tracking but as soon as I left the post office I felt regret. Lo and behold 10 days later and 3 days after his birthday it’s not been delivered. It cost €6.60 to post, I didn’t ask or wasn’t offered tracking but it may have cost €10?

Why should we have to feel like we need to get something tracked for it to be delivered safely? If you post something as standard post you should have confidence it will get delivered.

Anyway I’m kicking myself for not getting tracking cause I have no idea where the package is now and despite being organised in advance, I’ve now got to get a belated present for my Dad and go deliver it myself.

We are best friends and do the majority of things together. Aside from travelling away for work sometimes, we see each other every day in the morning and the evenings, and all day weekends. 

I (F27) still get so excited to see my boyfriend (M29) literally every evening. I usually get home first, hear the lock in the door and wait for him at the top of the stairs up to our apartment. I give him a huge hug when he gets in, ask him about his day etc. When I see him just relaxing in the living room I think he's the cutest, most handsome guy ever and he often has to peel me off him - not even in a sexual way, just snuggling up and kissing his cheeks because I love him. I get excited that we can cuddle every night to go to sleep. I love when he plans dates and days out for us at the weekend, even though that's every weekend. If he takes me out for coffee it makes me so happy. Little things he does for me literally make me want to scream because of how loved up I feel, like the luckiest girl in the world.

Obviously we argue sometimes and he drives me nuts, but for the most part I'm literally so obsessed still and just feel so happy every day that I've landed such an amazing guy. 

Is this normal? Surely not everyone in long term relationships is this crazy in love; I literally get distracted from my day-to-day tasks because I want to kiss his stupid cute face. Will this level of excitement and obsession die down at some point? ",27,1749160134.0,stupidquestions,22,0.79,False

I’ve been working on a few things that might seem random from the outside, but they’re actually all part of a bigger vision I’ve been building toward:

* A coffee cart I run at events/pop-ups — eventually part of a creative café space for indie filmmakers and builders
* Writing a feature film that is a psychological romance in a fine dining setting, also shooting short films on the side
* Working on smaller tech projects I feel like I have an idea for an app every other week for me to use so I go and make it
* (And a past project — a home-cook food platform I built and sold — that taught me a lot about marketplaces and systems)

Not raising money, trying to do this full-time while doing my day job — just trying to finish projects, explore my curiosity, and maybe turn one of them into something real over time. It’s tough juggling creative + tech lanes while working a day job.

Curious how others here manage momentum across different projects. Are you focusing on one thing at a time or letting projects organically evolve?

Greetings loyal captial citizens this is your  6 oclock news. Unforeanutly tradegie struck early in the day  where the ever ilesuive Hawk Fishburne went missing  but thankfully was found in a narcopletic state in the forests of district 3. It is also noted that we all encouraging captial lights to stay in doors within these challenging times.  Siginton Wolfram James was last spotted running out of  a coffee shop as  leaving the malnourished of  Nathan Oz famous capitol director  behind before the shop set ablaze, Authorities told us that this “alien” may actually not be him. Still I suggest to all capitol families to keep the doors locked and keep your avox;s home. We dont know SIginton and Hawk’s next move but. “IGNAIO LOOK”.

What the hell was that.  Its weird how he did not die in the games. Its a werid speculation though. “MOM!”. “WHat do you need Hennry”. “Come look”. Jade walked down the steps of her aging home  before seeing Mayor Denvil at her foot step. Jade grumbled and told him to buzz of before saying “ we dont ned another quarrel”. Denvil smiled just saying that he needed to talk to Hermnia. Jade looked seeing the 4 peacekeepers  with him before calling for her husband. As he did not reply her older Hennry went up the stairs before stopping. He told Mayor Denvil to hold on with the later shouting “You lost two kids in the games Jade i can wait as long as you need doesnt little Appollo want to voultner”. Jade slapped Denvil but  a peacekeeper told them to stop, Denvil claimed that if Jade needed a “little more time he could wait”.  Jewel Heath Hennry Heath Apollo Heath and Lauren Heath became deadly quiet as Hennry;s 4 minth old son cried. Jade opened the door hearing a loud “CLOSE THE DOOR BITCH”. 14 year old Jewel  peered over before Jade screamed “CHEATER”. Jade told he rkids to go with Mayor Denvil as Hennry’s wife Alice.

As a gunshot rung Denvil went white and said “everythinmg alright up their Jade”. Another gunshot fired before Alice and henry told Denvil that they would go find Heriminia.  Jade and Eligypumia fell to the ground covering their abomdmens in pain. Valreigo made a bolt out the window only to be met with a bullet to the head by peacekeeprs. Thankfully Jade was saved in time as the mayor enetoruge arrived back in time.

Currently the hermit and disturbed 20 year old victor broke ot of mayoral custody and now is being dragged back to the captial custody. Once citizen who I am with today says the following.

“So maam tell me what happened , what did the hermit do.’

 Shes not responding huh.

“Come on lady”.

As the lady ran off teh reporters took their vision to Hawk being loaded in the back of a peacekeper van. The feed cut back to Perfection HQ  as Ignaio the 4 main news reporters hushed the capitals worries. To pass the time Laureli Wivett a former Anderson Fashoin model switched the topic to her segment “Tea and gossip”. 

Darling of the capitol  I think its time for some brightness.

Right as Laureli was about to dive into the recent scandal regarding districts 8s Mayor Zion Indigo’s affair with a old rebel.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h86EHH1Y50A


Laureli ignored one of the producers yelling “ LET ME FINSH THEN WE WILL COVER IT”.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h86EHH1Y50A


Laureli stomped on the ground with the lead host Tilliea  Mayfeild put a hand on Laureli’s shoulder.

“Ciztens of the captial dont worry this statmengt price states that Siginton false was arrested as he was the one whoe xploded the maxniums ecrutity prison. Oddly to get a  lesser sentnce Sistyumo and Noko both turned against SIginton which allowed them who did not play apart in the prison explosion. This person who was one of the many impiron nations of SIginton thirty two year old ATonimia Perez decdent of the delusional ATomica Perez victor of the 96th hunger games.”


Laureli kicked the reporter of the air as Tiliea muttered let her get it out of her system.  To round out the hour Laureli and her 3 co host friends went through victors tweets on captial twitter and laughed and stupid ones.

Rounding out the hour the hosts the hosts  theorized on the next years games even allowing a hint that Head Game maker Drucsilia O hera gave on the arena. AN old playground. Ignaio joked “We doing a pizza place spin off?”. As the hosts laughed they all signed off with laureli telling viewers to stay tuned for  the 12 tea hour that Laureli and Caroline Wiveett hosted.

1l4bm6k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l4bm6k,Book Review: All About Irma,"Well, time for best girl. (According to recent, totally unbiased surveys)

I am assuming this will be similar to Will's book. Ie: Stories based on the comics, with added thoughts and fluff. And: Completely lacking in actual ""All about"". Fun fact: Opening words have Irma describe herself as a ""Mermaid, but better."". (She's so modest) I use ""( )"" for commentary. And ""\[ \]"" for when the story has actual ( ) text.

Chapter 1: A Problem Named Andrew Hornby (Accidentally translated this one word for word rather than a summary. But... I felt it could be relevant to the puberty deniers\~ It does also raise questions regarding Irma's whole... early behavior.)  
  
**Temptations**  
Up in Kandrakar they never get tired of blathering on. ""Don't do this. Don't do that. You can't do such thing! That is wrong! What were you thinking?!"" bla, bla, bla! And sure, they are correct. But, things are... sometimes you just gotta give in to your urges, right? In case I became the Oracle: I'd have to keep it in my pants. But, until then...  
**A bright idea**  
It's no secret Andrew is one of the hottest guys in school. Everyone knows that. If you check the dictionary, there's a picture of him under ""Delicious"".  So like, I had an idea... Certain... **things** happen to our bodies when we transform. We look several years older. \[And we become more... **form fitting**, if you know what I mean.\] I thought it was a bright idea. Turn into a WITCH and bewitch Andrew! Yes, yes, yes... I really shouldn't have. But it wasn't **that** bad. Just a misdemeanor, like dad would say.  
  
Initially, it went great! I transformed, went out, eyes on the prize. Ready to score/get laid. (Translates into either. Literal would be ""Score a goal"") There was a party at Zot, a disco in town. I knew Andrew would be there. I went there, hoping to show off my most ""**magical assets**"". I should probably have hidden... Like I had hid my wings. But, I went ahead. Huge success so far! I wasn't just let in, I got to chat AND dance with him! SO cool!  
He then offered to drive me home. And like, it was late. Why not? But... how could I know what Andrew had in mind?  
Cool party... with frogs. To make a long story short: Andrew had NO intentions of driving me home. He drove out to the observatory, parked the car and... tried to KISS me!

To be honest, I was quite shocked. I kinda blanked out for a moment. I don't remember what happened... But I turned him into a frog. Like in that fairy tale. Except in reverse. So, there I was: In a car with a blonde do' frog. I was apparently not the only one scared, based on his expression. And then: He suddenly hopped out the window and was gone. And like... I had to WALK home!  
Then... I told the girls, even though I really didn't want to talk about it. We went back to the bog to find him, and things returned to normal... kinda.  
So... today Andrew is returning to school after ""mysteriously disappearing"" for several days. I really don't want to see him again. I feel a little guilty over what happened. And... I'm afraid he remembers what I did. What if he connects ME to his unfortunate ""accident""? Plus: I'm not exactly proud over my actions... I still think he's cute. Even if he's triggkiss happy...  
The issue is he has no idea I exist. Or rather: He DOES know. But: He IGNORES me completely. He only fancied my sexier ""cousin"". And, that hurts. It makes me sad inside. So, I've decided to avoid him. That way, I can avoid future ""accidents"". Out of sight, out of mind, yes?

**Changes**  
During recess, I usually meet the girls by the lockers. We were getting some books for the last two hours. And it's safe to do at that time, as Uriah and his gang are always skulking the bathrooms by then.  
Cornelia was the first to spot me and gave me a wry smile. ""Hey there, heart-breaker."" she said and elbowed me. Aaand there she goes... COMPLETELY the correct day to start this... If she doesn't cut it out, I'll strangle her... ""Seen Andrew lately?"" she asked sweetly. I already TOLD her!  
""I know you said you don't want to see him, buuut\~ He wants to see YOU\~"" she sang. What? I don't believe my ears! ""I met him outside of the lab."" She said, serious. If she's fucking with me, she's good...  
""He asked me if I knew where you were. - Oh... was he angry? - Not at all. He had a dorky smile and a glint in his eyes."" She replied.

**Doubt**  
No, let's think this over, be rational... He probably had the flu. That's why he looked stupid. Corny obviously can't tell love apart from disease. But... ""stupid smile"" and ""glint in eyes"" are kinda... telling. Weird, right?  
If he remembered, he'd hate me, right? Besides: How would he know it was me? Sure, it WAS me. But not me, me. Not regular Irma. I was different. Better. **Bigger**, grown up. But perhaps... Maybe my mystical aura snuck its way into his heart? Only one way to find out... I'd wait for him during the last hour of school.  
No, I'm not wasting any more time. There's five minutes left until the bell rings. Now or never!

**The big meeting**  
I found Andrew at the gym. He was alone, eyes drifting. Like he was looking for someone. As soon as he saw me, he lit up. ""Hi Irma!"" he said sweetly. ""Glad to see you got my message."" He added. ""Eh... I heard you wanted to see me?"" I murmured. ""Well, I wanted to ask you something, but... it's kinda embarrassing"" He admitted and averted his gaze. Omigosh! He's SO cute when he's flustered! My heart almost burst out of my chest, but I tried to behave. ""So, you know I was at Zot the other day..."" He whispered all sultry. ""I've never had such fun with a girl before and-"" my face lit up like baboon. How are you supposed to maintain a normal color in these situations?! Even Andrew was red!  
""Well, as said: I wanted to ask you something, if you don't mind, that is..."" he noted. I mean, I don't mind... But it would be nice if he could see me when he asked me on a date\~  
Deep breath Irma... omigosh! It's happening!

**The big question**  
""Could I get your cousins number?"" he blurted out.  
Petrified.  
""I never got to ask her myself... But I'd **really** want to meet her again, you know?"" he added. He had said what he had wanted. He looked at me aroused, excited. He had a firm grip on his phone, ready to type in ""her"" number. I had to compose myself. I didn't know if I should scream, cry or scold him.  
I don't know why, but I did neither... My body answered him on its own, despite having trouble getting any words out. ""My... cousin... lives overseas. She was just here over the weekend."" I mumbled. Andrew looked extremely disappointed. But there was no comfort to be had.  
He had wanted a PHONE NUMBER?! But not MINE?!  
Thankfully, I was saved by the bell. First time I was eager to go to class. ""Yeah, well... bye. - Well, if she returns, let me know, okay?"" I am DONE with him!

**The grand finale**  
My so called friends just HAD to stop laughing and comfort me a little instead. ""Snrk, repeat **exactly** what he told you!"" Will asked. She tried to be serious. But she was clearly bursting at the seams. ""Again? It's the THIRD time!"" I barked. ""I said: Andrew wanted my COUSINS phone number!"" I declared. ""Ah yes... your ""cousin""\~"" Cornelia laughed. ""The one he met at Zot some days ago."" She added. ""But... you don't have any cousins?"" Taranee questioned. ""BLARGGLLG! NO! I DON'T!"" I exploded. ""Stop trampling what's left of my dignity!"" I huffed.  
""I'm sorry, Irma. But how can we not laugh at such ludicrous situation?"" Will pointed out. The worst part: She's right.  
It WAS a crazy situation. And if it hadn't happened to me: I'd be the first in line to mock it! Like, Andrew WAS in love with me... Just the version of me he had seen at Zot. That is to say: A me that wasn't really my me. Which he thought was my cousin... I can't even be jealous! The other woman is... ME! This is a ripe mess! But! I promise to NEVER use my powers for love related squabbles again! Irma AND her cousin pinkie promise!

Chapter 2: A day at Golden  
**It wasn't my fault!**  
It doesn't take a genius to know mom with crossed arms means trouble. Add a dad and you know you're fucked. They asked if I know why they were here. It's best to always deny, that way you don't confess to something unrelated.  
Life as a WITCH can be a pain. The astral drops are THE worst! You turn your back for five seconds, then: BOOM! Ruined your life. Sometimes I wish dad wasn't a cop... He wants me to wash dishes to pay the bill. My parents are slave drivers. Luckily: I'm strong. 

My drop had a ton of excuses. I'm almost impressed. Not like I can tell my parents it was actually my doppleganger that did the crime. While I was off in other dimensions protecting the universe with my powers over water... Yeah, that'll work.  
Luckily, everyone was forced to work at Golden. But they had a weird way to show solidarity. Corny is just moping. At least Dotty is a legendary waitress... She taught me how to carry four trays at once AND how to make coffee. There's SO many ways to make coffee... I've come to realize service workers don't get enough respect.

THE worst are the ""companies"", twenty people, incapable of reading. They sit half an hour trying to choose between sandwich and burger. It's not hard! Take BOTH! Atop it all: Uriah and his assholes showed up... He OGLED me! I CAN END HIM! I'm gonna EXPLODE! It would just be a **temporary** struggle. Then: Gone!  
Will expressed great concern about my revenge fantasies. Like, hear me out... would anyone **really** miss him? (I know Irma is a menace to society but... I always assumed she was more... ""team non-permanent solution"".) But no... Will sternly told me I CANNOT do that. I'm already in trouble for using magic irresponsibly I guess... I mean, at least half the students would notice if I sent a beam of energy and disintegrated him. Taranee noted he is so stupid, it would be animal cruelty.  
  
He tried to break me, but Dottie intervened. But then, he INSULTED Dotty! That's it! I'M THROWING HANDS! I dumped the content of my drink over him. I didn't care what happened. Dotty complimented me for my ability to give customers ""refreshments"" before they asked. I even ended the day with plenty of tips! JUSTICE! The girls asked what I planned to do with all the money. Normally, I'd get pizza... But I'm gonna invest in my future! I'll try to buy the test result answers to the next history quizz!

Chapter 3: A lover to Rose  
I asked dad if he thinks there should be a picture of me as well in the newspaper. But he just kept hugging me, asking if I was okay. Cops were swarming the place, and no-one even thanked me. I JUST stopped a robbery!  
Normally, I visit dad at the station, then go with Rose to have some cocoa. It's our tradition. It started several years ago. She's really sweet and shy. She's almost like the perfect big sister to me. I told her about school, she mentioned the gory details dad refused to tell me. She says I'd be a great detective! She has a crush on a trucker.  
I want to help her but... love isn't really my forte.

**Love mysteries**  
My first love was Anthony. But, everyone called him Tony. We were in the same class. We didn't speak, until one day he snagged my lunchbox. Next thing, we were playing in puddles and throwing paper airplanes. But, after the summer: He had moved. End of that story. I learned early on that boys can't express their feelings normally. You always need to translate them.  
The ""I love you"" in movies is pure fantasy. At best, they'll pull your hair or throw notes at you. And **you** have to decipher if it's malicious or not. And we, as girls have to stay awake all night and figure out if WE even like them back. But Rose? She just exchanged awkward eye contact. Maybe he was scared of her badge? ""Isn't he cute?"" she sighed. As the two stared at each other, I was the only one to notice the men entering his truck... I managed to kick Rose into gear, and it was like one of those movies! She managed to catch the idiots that drove into an alley. Dad said I won't be in the news as it was grand theft auto, not a robbery. And I should be glad to be unharmed. Well, at least Rose started talking to the trucker... Love seems stupid. End of the world.

Chapter 4: Me and Karmilla  
I can't sleep... I'm still shaking. I can't believe it happened. But, my diary is the proof. Everything started so... normal. So boring...  
I had just bought the papers. \[I never do. But, today was different! Karmilla was on the front!\] The others were occupied by ice cream. Hay Lin said it's cute how much she cares for her fans. Cute? She's MORE than cute! She's THE best singer AND most raw person in the world! Corny even admitted her songs are bangers.  
Then, the world froze. She's HERE. TODAY! FILMING! I clutched the paper. ""Girls, I know what we're doing today!""  
**Attack on the Imperial Hotel**  
As always, Cornelia is the crusher of dreams. Primarily mine. And the others agreed? ""How would we get in? We'd never get to meet her!"" PAH! I'm a one girl army! Fine, I'll do it myself!  
As I arrived... I wasn't expecting a literal horde of girls and boys screaming her name. Armed with my elbows, I set forth. It took an hour just to move a few meters. Pft, all these posers wanting to meet her.  
Me and Karmilla have a special bond! We like the same chocolate, to have our legs on the couch. We're like... destined to be together! ... Despite her being a rockstar. Despite my best efforts, nothing worked. Hours passed. Suddenly: The crowd dispersed. She had finished filming and... left... I felt empty inside. Alone... I opened my eyes and I found myself on a bench at the park? I can't believe it... I MISSED her...

I feel awful... I normally never hyperventilate, but I could afford it now. I **deserve** to meet her! She didn't even show up to wave! ... She can't have become a diva? No, impossible!  
**A surprise encounter**  
I was in the middle of my ""happy thoughts"" when some chick approached me. ""Excuse me, do you know if this park has a drinking fountain?"" she asked. Weirdo. Sunglasses and wrapped up. There's no sun. Whatever. ""Yeah, it's behind the-"" I trailed off, paralyzed. A suspicious rose... Those features, the curves, the hair texture... Karmilla?! It can't be? She's sweating, thirsty. Like us mortals! I SWEAT! She's JUST like me! I flared up. Oh crap! I've just been staring for ten seconds!  
**Starlife**  
I KNOW where the fountain is, but my words did not grammar! I've dreamt of this moment a million times. She suddenly laughed. I squeaked and made noises. ""Recognized me, huh?"" she teased. ""Know my songs?"" she added. ""Know them? I LOVE them! I can sing all of them from memory! You're amazing, brilliant!"" my thoughts finally formed words. ""Thanks. But, about that fountain..."" She said. Oh, right, yes... ""Behind the ice cream truck..."" I sputtered. She began to leave. No! It can't end like this!""

Stuttering two sentences can't be my only memories! I want to ask her a thousand things. Tell her how important she is to my life. I listen to her first thing in the morning! Seriously, Irma! You're raw, crass and without manners. And you sit here whimpering?  
**A very special autograph**  
To my confusion, she didn't leave. She just stood there, looking at me. ""You're not a regular fan, are you?"" she asked with a smile.  
""While it's nice to have admirers, they never treat me as a person. I have to dress up as a spy just to go anywhere."" She noted.  
I still can't believe she just stood there, treating me as a friend. ""Look, I really appreciate that you haven't attacked me, like most fans."" She added. ""Though, I'm guessing you still want an autograph? I should almost ask you for one, you're not like other fans."" She teased.

I was speechless. Then broke out laughing. ""Of course I'd like one!"" I giggled. ""I'm Irma!"" I declared and gave her pen and papper, and she wrote down ""To Irma, who saved my life by guiding me to water. BIG kiss to my biggest fan!"".  
When I told the others, they didn't believe me. But they DID after I showed them the autograph! It's currently safe in my dairy. Tomorrow, I'm going to get it framed! ... I still can't sleep. I'm still thinking of everything I wanted to say if I had the time... And courage... But like Will said: Don't worry about it. Something **always** happens when you meet someone that's... ""special"" to you. She should know. Considering her track record with Matt.  
It's both wonderful and exhausting to have idols!

Chapter 5: The Joys of Camping  
A week with the happy bears? Ugh... It was this or living with aunt Mildred. It's only a week. I'm a mature and responsible girl. I can handle it.  
**Greendale forest**  
Siiiigh... This camp is awful. No spa, hot spring, lake or anything! They asked me to pitch a tent, but I don't know anything about sticks! The others however, got them up in a few minutes. This isn't relaxing at all!  
And to think the girls were jealous of me... if they only knew! I swear! Everything I'm saying is true! No normal, sane person would put the alarm for six in the morning! They were dressed while I was still opening my eyes! They told me ""You'll get used to it!"" NO!  
I went to take my morning shower... There was a hose... In a tree... It does not deserve to be called water. \[I'm somewhat of an expert\] I REFUSE to wash in these conditions. My naked butt remained dry... If I could use my powers, I'd just make a nice, big jacuzzi. For obvious reasons: I cannot. Though... It does dawn on me that I won't smell very nice by the end of this week...

Since I got up ""late"", seven. There was no breakfast left! Just lukewarm tea! Lunch wasn't any better. These kids can't cook. Am I the only one? By dinner, I was so hungry that the gruel tasted good. Well, no. Not really. But almost. Then, **I** had to do the dishes. This was torture. AND my air mattress got a puncture first thing!  
Though, I haven't missed TV in three days... it was a weird feeling.  
Even weirder, Jessy asked me if there was something between me and Martin. Like, what? Ew, gross, no, NO! What is WRONG with her?  
But... she's really cool. She fixed my mattress! And I've promised to help  be her wingmaiden. Like... thinking about it: There is ONLY positives here. If those two become a pair... he'll leave my ass alone! No more ""sweet plum"" or being my tail.  
**New plan**  
The next day, I caved. My butt became iced. This is a human rights violation! Ban cold showers!  
The march was even worse. All of Irma hurt. The others were singing. WHERE did they get air from? The waterfall was nice though. I did the mistake of dipping my feet. COLD.  
  
I did ask around about operation love doves. And got some ideas... I asked them for help to organize my belongings in something. And they suggested a fruit box. I gave the excuse that I don't know how... which, honestly: Was just the truth. But, I needed **them** to do it.  
They began to argue, and I slipped away. But, when I came back... They had made me two boxes... One each. They had just argued instead of working together. Curses! My plan had been so good! Though, honestly... all this time has made me see Martin in a new light. I still want them to date. But he's much less annoying... Perhaps he's only bad within confined spaces? He actually has things to occupy him out here.  
... I can't have feelings for him, right? No, that's absurd! I just need a warm shower, some smog, double breakfast and some sleep. And I'll be good as new!

Chapter 6: S.O.S Shellshocked!  
**Unforeseen disasters**  
It was one of those days in a cartoon. You're just walking along, then SPRDRAAANG! Anvil to the head, and you're an accordion!  
How does this even happen? ""Did you check closely?"" Taranee asked. ""Of course I did! He's no longer in my backpack! ... Lil' Badly... - How do you lose a turtle? - I DON'T KNOW!"" I barked. I feel awful... My lil' shelly, alone in a dangerous world...  
**The hours before**  
I had asked dad to drive me to school, on a sunday. Had you told me I'd do this before today, I would have laughed. Typical parents. He didn't think I could care for my turtle. I'm just taking him for a quick trip!  
We were doing a project for school about endangered animals. And Will said something was missing. We needed a mascot! And Leafy was the perfect fit! He lives with me. Doesn't speak much. \[Ha ha ha!\] But he's a GREAT listener. I cleaned him up. Built him an extra home. Gave him a bracelet. He was immaculate. He poked his head out of the backpack. I gave him a boop as he withdrew. That's the last time I saw him.

**Desperation**  
As we reached the gymnasium, he was gone! Will said he must have slipped out when I put the bag down. We searched EVERYWHERE. Every  bush, every patch of grass, behind every nook and cranny.  
He's a turtle! Not a tortoise! He'll die without regular access to water!  
After an hour, we went back to school. I broke down crying.  
Suddenly, Matt came running over. ""Irma! Take a look at this! Sheffield got a new student!"" I followed him, and there he was! Leafy, on a table. He stared at me as if nothing had happened. There was a note. ""Hooray for Horseberg! The only student slower than me!"".  
I found out what happened: He rushed out when I put my bag down. He had seen our fountain. A student later found him in the grass, and seeing the bracelet, got curious and brought him inside.  
**A good ending**  
I've never been more relived. Leafy is okay. And he is the BEST mascot this school has ever seen. He looked SO cute! Leafy is very special. Red-eared sliders are a unique species!  
All and all... everything worked out.

Chapter 7: A Fish on Land  
I know I said I wouldn't use my powers for personal again... BUT!  
Ever since I played \[THE best\] dragon in Hay Lin's play, I've had an itch to act. And then, I saw it... The theather was looking for someone: Close to 20. No experience needed. Enthusiasm and charisma required. That role was PERFECT for me! Age aside...  
So... I transformed. And I know what you're thinking: What to wear? A full wardrobe, and nothing in it. If it can happen a mere mortal, it can happen to me. And like you know: My body changes. My legs. Longer. My breasts... bigger\~ Maybe I could borrow some of mom's clothes? She has that nice black- No! Bad idea! It looks a bit too ""maternal"" after all. And if mom found out I took it... I'd need to grow some SERIOUS walls. (I took some liberty with the translation here, to give it a more feminine twist. As the original is quite literally ""I'd need some HUGE BALLS"" or ""BIG DICK"". No, it's not censored in the book. But kind clear what she means.)

In the end, I just went as ""the other Irma"". After all: If anyone asks, I'll just say I'm in costume for my current role. Besides: It makes me look like a busy actress!  
As I arrived, the place looked dilapidated. I waited for my turn, butterflies aplenty, and instead of letting me perform, I was handed a folder. They wanted me to improvise. A sailor? I can perform a sailor so hard a rock would cry! ... Wait, no... I'm playing a killer whale? And this guy is playing a... raft? He's not even hot! What is this play? I've never felt more stupid in my life. This guy sure is acting like a raft, waving his arms... I wanna go home and eat nutella... ""Perfect! The role is yours!"" he exclaimed. ... Seriously? He thinks I'm going to using magical powers to transform into a WITCH, to play a stupid fish?! Yeah, NOT going to happen. Even I have limits on irresponsible use of my powers.

Chapter 8: Trick or treat  
Life is unfair  
""But mooom! - No butts. You're going with your brother. - I don't wanna! - He's too young to go alone, missy."" Mom declared.  
""I'm not THAT young!"" Christopher huffed. ""Shut the fuck up, you cretin!"" I snapped back. There's nothing worse than a little brother! ... Well, maybe **two** little brothers. A big brother would at least be useful.  
Christopher is definitely the type that would befriend pieces of shit. IF he was older, I'd have a group of boys that were in love with me. They all fall for the younger sister, that's how it works. Instead, I have an old bike and there's always cartoons in the TV. Mom says I only have bad excuses. That's not true. I just have better shit to do! I hate having to go ""Trick or treat!"". Why can't I be an only child? (Honestly surprised Irma wouldn't be all in for free candy... she loves dressing up.)  
**Fastest draw in the west**  
Some are talented in music, others in sport. I'm an expert in fuck ups.  
Despite my best effort: I was forced to dress up. I had an old sheet. Great. A cowboy and a ghost. It took over an hour of whining before he agreed to go home. I pulled the sheet off and he shrieked. Great, I had sweated so much I was a mess.

On our way home, he pointed down a street. ""Jimmy lives there, can we go?"" he asked. Well... I guess it's only one more house...  ""He taught me how to squirt soda out my nose!"" he chimed. ""I wish I had a brother."" He sighed. ""I have one. They're pretty useless."" I assured him. ""You're just a chick! You don't get it."" He retorted. I'll make him rue those words... Later.  
We knocked on the door. ""Trick or treat!"" he exclaimed. My heart skipped a beat. David Fox, THE hottest boy in Sheffield! He graduated two years ago! ... And I'm looking like a soggy monster that's been buried for years! I'm done! SO DONE!  
""Is this your brother?"" he asked. ""... Yeah"" I mumbled. I wouldn't mind if he taught me how to squirt...  
""Do you think you can help me? My brother has been crying all evening, his mummy costume is kinda ruined... I used all the bandages from the first aid kid, but it wasn't enough. And there's nothing else left!"" he explained.  
""... Did you try toilet paper?"" I offered. ""OF COURSE!"" he exclaimed.

With the crisis averted, I had time to go home, shower and join the girls at the party. Corny was agitated, lovely. ""Hey, did I miss anything?"" I asked. ""You won't **believe** who's here! Visiting his family before heading off to college!"" she hissed. She suddenly froze and stared behind me. I turned around. It was the hunk himself. ""Hey Irma!"" he said. ""Sup?"" I replied. My jaw trembled. But, it's easier to stay calm when I'm not a mess. Everyone was too stunned to notice. ""Cool\~ - Well, catch you later!"" he said. Not the most impressive exchange... But the girls were in awe. ""YOU KNOW DAVID FOX?!"" Hay Lin exclaimed. ""Why wouldn't I?"" I replied casually.  
**A mystical affair**  
It's not everyday you see Corny flabbergasted. Life's finest pleasure. ""C'mon! Tell us!"" Will blurted out. ""Oh... it's a long story, maybe I'll tell you sometime\~ But, right now I need some lemonade!"" I chimed and walked off. One day I'll tell them the truth. Soggy girl, toilet boy and all. But for now: I'll enjoy my triumph!

Chapter 9: Fear of Math  
WHY ME?!  
WHY THIS?!  
WHY NOW?!  
Atop it all: Tara said she doesn't get it! Easy for her to say, she's gifted.  
Multiplication makes me ill. I can see Horseberg's satanic smile as he smears my test in red. It's what he lives for.  
I'll try to read two chapters a day.  
Okay, I couldn't read today. I had to listen to a new CD.  
I called in backup. But Tara didn't even let me have third dinner! I had to starve. I barely made my sandwich. And there's three things I hate: 1: Homework. 2: Numbers. 3: Lessons.  
She's really good, but pestering. When she left, I was shaken. I threw myself onto my bed. After TWO seconds, Christopher barged in. He asked where my friend went, before dinner. He was mortified to hear she went home to **willingly** do homework.  
I'm feeling ill... normally, I'm great at just ignoring this.  
Things aren't going great. There's 43 hours left. And I need to sleep my minimum 10 hours.  
  
I had a BIG breakfast. (I didn't want to risk a breakdown due to sugar loss.) The little pest was making noise. Mom called me down for dinner. ""I can't! I'm doing homework!"" I shouted back. Mom poked her head in ""... Honey, are you okay?"" she asked, concerned. ""Very funny..."" I replied. ""I can make you a snack?"" she offered. (Lowkey, I find it cute that her family and friends are concerned if Irma isn't attempting to body slam any nearby food.)  
Well... A hungry Irma is a depressed Irma...  
I laid my head down for just a second. CRAP! Four hours passed?! Geez, I need a bath to calm my nerves... Need to take my time with the hair drier too... What's this? I gotta wax my legs. There's an entire jungle down there!  
... It's D day... I'm fucked.  
  
Will noted that I look weird. I told her I slept wrong. But I'm ready. ""See? Math isn't THAT bad."" Tara piped up. ""You misunderstand. I just managed to calm myself."" I said and handed a confused Tara a paper. ""What is this?!"" she asked. ""A secret formula. I wrote down the answer to every question, and coded it. - This is gibberish! - Of course! Otherwise horseberg could read it. - How can YOU read it? - I inscribed the rebus on the back of my calculator. - ... HOW long did this take? - I barely slept tonight, don't remind me. - Irma! If you had spent HALF this time CHEATING, on just STUDYING..."" I waved her off. I know she's right, but like... can you blame me? I deserve victory pizza.  
I got an amazing 11! Not 9, not 7. 11! (Being 25 years ago... I have NO idea what this would be grade wise. But my guess would be the equivalent of a B) Here I come, double cheese, mushrooms and artichoke!  
I was honestly amazing. I didn't know studying could have results. I WAS going to cheat. But, the cruel Horseberg hadn't allowed calculators! I thought I was cooked. But then I read the first question: I couldn't understand it. But I COULD solve it. All the tutoring and code crafting had effects! Maybe being a bookworm wasn't the worst? Though, I have a reputation to uphold.

Photo gallery:  
Various pictures from the comics with captions. Some of more note:  
Ugh... mondays...  
I'm VERY photogenic!  
Me and Martin are ONLY friends.  
The black was just to make mom laugh. (In reference to her mental breakdown and coloring her hair.)

Final thoughts: It felt a bit more personal than Will's... though I suppose it just matches their personalities more. As Will is much more reserved. Both still sorely lack any kind of actual ""All about"". I ended up translating far more than intended, as its meant to be more of a summary, but ah well. I was honestly surprised by how much crass language they could include. But, I suppose if there is an English version, that IS much more censored, just like how the comics have a US and a European version.",1,1749159975.0,GuardiansOftheVeil,1,1.0,False

Trying to have a real convo on dating apps is tough. I go out a lot with friends and admittedly get hit on. But I have an issue with feeling like I wont actually be accepted by the person. So im here in hopes that if I say a little about myself first, and someone else who values getting to know someone sees this, I'll have a real shot at forming a connection.

A little about me physically. Im confident in my looks. Im mexican and Puerto Rican but a no sabo☠️. Im tatted up and like to wear a little jewelry. Dress kinda alternative, and nice at the same time. Im 5'8 and average build. I'll also link some pics.

About me in general. I'm told I'm the most open minded and accepting person a lot of people know. I've experienced a lot in my life and have met all kinds of people. Which has given me many different perspectives. I feel like life gets boring if I put myself in a box and stick to one line of thinking. Which is why I try to leave myself open to as much as possible. That's probably one of the reasons im here now, lol.

Some of my interests. There's a lot I like to do. Im an art lover, I collect it as well as try my hand at making it. I love to spray paint in my backyard when i have the time. I also love antiquing. I mostly grab whatever vintage magazine catches my eye cause I want to have the coolest coffee table in my future home. I'm also a huge foodie, I love to cook it just as much as I love to eat. I dont think there's one food that I'll ever turn down trying. I love traveling and have been to 2 different countries so far. A dream of mine is spending like a month in a camper someday. Just traveling on the road. Other than that I game a little, love movies, anime and webcomics. Oh and I love comedy. Laughter is a big part of my life.

Well I'll end it here. Feel free to shoot me a dm if I caught your eye or want a new pal to talk to! Im open to anything and would even love talking on the phone or gaming with someone to break the ice! Thanks for reading!

1l4bib5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l4bib5/aitah_for_ending_things_with_my_autistic_ex_after/,"AITAH for ending things with my autistic ex after months of confusing behavior, secrets, mixed signals, and emotional whiplash?","
Should I send a message?So this is a long story, but I need to know: AITAH?

I was talking to this girl for a while, and at some point, we did a video call — but she refused to show herself. She always said her hair was messy or gave some other excuse. Eventually, she told me she had autism. Our conversations were always kind of one-sided. We planned to meet at the park, but she canceled, saying she had hurt her leg.

After she told me about her autism, I started treating her more gently, and she noticed. She told me her ex abandoned her, and another guy she was seeing replaced her out of nowhere. I tried to be there for her.

One day I got mugged and almost lost her number. What surprised me was how indifferent she was. She didn't seem to care and even told me she wouldn’t message me again unless I messaged first.

She’d often talk about her cats. One time she got super mad at her cousin for saying she used to drink with her ex. That seemed to hit a nerve.

Later, I invited her to the movies because she once told me we never go out. She said she was too embarrassed to go. After I insisted, she agreed — but the next day, she asked, “Wouldn’t it be better if we were just friends?” Still, we went. We met there, bought candy, kissed during the movie, and had a sweet date.

She never let me see her phone, and didn’t give me her Instagram until after we broke up. She was always very distant.

Another time, we went to the mall and she gave me chocolate. We ended up going to a motel. When we got there, she suddenly said she was ashamed and didn’t want the lights on. I said it was okay, but she got reactive and changed moods fast. We stayed anyway, and then went home.

Once, after a date at the park, I walked her home, but it was clear she didn’t want me to meet her family. I still dropped her off and went home.

Another episode: her sister dropped her off at my place. I joked that we didn’t go out much because she was always being difficult — she got really mad.

We played a game together once and I criticized it; she got upset and quit mid-game. Another time she brought me chocolate, we kissed, and shortly after she talked about breaking up.

She invited me to a party, then said she wasn’t going, then said she was. I got annoyed and asked if she even wanted me to go. I asked if I could arrive early, and she explicitly said no, only after 6 PM. I went earlier anyway, and her sister saw me on the street and invited me up.

We ended up going to her friend's party. She introduced me as her boyfriend. Then suddenly she blurted out, “Should we download an app to find you a hot girl?” Out of nowhere. Super weird.

After that, we went back to her place. She wanted me to sleep over, but I went home instead.

After all this emotional back and forth, I finally called her and broke up. She started crying and then blocked me. Later, she told me I had ""sent her to a psych clinic (CAPS)"" and said I had ""taken away her happiness.""

But soon after, she messaged saying she missed me more than she thought she would. So we started talking again.

While we were chatting, I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she said I should just find someone else. I was furious and asked what was going on — she claimed she was on there looking for her friend's ex?? I don’t even know what that means.

Eventually, I told her I still loved her. She said she had gone out and wished I was there. Then she called me and invited me to her mom’s birthday party. I didn’t go. Her mom later called me, asking if I loved her daughter. Then invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again, but then she said her dad was really angry at me. I got upset and vented online. She saw the post and said I used her and deceived her. She said she was just insecure because of her autism, that she prayed for me every day, then blocked me again and vanished.

So… AITAH for finally breaking it off after all that, even knowing she has autism? Or did I just get emotionally manipulated to hell and back?

1l4bhe0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4ZUmWxGu08&t=1s,A Message to Julian G.,"Julian, this post is for you my guy, as I've seen you talk about this many times on the show. For one, saying, ""women ain't shit"" as your opener already tells me your mindset is already geared toward being suspiscious of every girl you talk to. Yes, it can be hard to gauge whether a woman likes you over the phone, that's why you shouldn't play by those rules.

Korey and Martin brought up a great point about FaceTime, and yeah, they're right. I do think, however, that you should ONLY FaceTime one time, which is before your first date (unless you start a committed relationship with a girl).

Say you match with a girl on a dating app, what you want to do is wait a while, and then engage maybe a day later (responding immediately and looking desperate is part of the problem, and some women don't like that). You can make a funny comment about her profile or compliment her. You should only say as very little as possible over DM/text, do not write paragraph long responses. Trying to drag out a conversation via text is awkward and becomes very stilted after a while. After that, give her your number. If she doesn't text, oh well. If she does, then you can text her back something like, ""How was your day?"" or “What are you up to?”

You talk for a little more over text after that, and then you ask if she wants to jump on Facetime. Using Facetime before the first date gets rid of the first date awkwardness, as you already saw how y'all vibed on FT. You can ask her out to dinner, or simply say say, “Let’s grab a drink or coffee this week, I know a good spot.” That’s it. Don’t go asking what she wants to do. Lead and be decisive. Girls get hit up by 10+ dudes a day andd you gotta separate yourself by how chill and confident you come off.

If she flakes or gives vague ass answers like “I’ll let you know” or “I’m really busy,” then guess what? She’s not into you like that, move on. No feelings, no texting her again. Just say something like, “No rush, just let me when you’re free.” You don’t chase. If a girl wants to see you, she will make it known.

And one more thing, stop catching feelings off FaceTime and two meetups. If you ain’t seen her more than 3–4 times in real life, and you’re not sleeping with her, you’re just another name in her phone. That’s not a relationship.

Get your reps in. Talk to more women. Don’t put one chick on a pedestal because she gave you a little attention.",1,1749159655.0,doubletoasted,0,1.0,False
1l4bha1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1l4bha1/psa_ghoul_is_now_good_end_game_thing_raids_pa_gp/,PSA: ghoul is now good end game thing (raids PA + GP),"when initially introduced I found ghoul to be a lot of chore for minimal benefits in raids. you loose access to low health play styles, need to manage BOTH AP and glow (so farm/sustain both canned coffee and toxic goo, slime cake being somewhat chore to keep up in hundreds (because it spoils)), except few melee hacks it was a let down IMO in raids where gatling plasma and PA dominates.

but not anymore!

a) blood sacrifice gives access to infinite AP and bloodied buffs (nerd rage)

b) conductor is good enough to loose HP gradually to get into needed hp % range while dealing damage

c) auto stim 1st star on armor suddenly makes sense, especially for ghoul who have no access to overeater and basically have no good 1st star armor mods

d) some use for hundreds of super-stims finally, to sustain both hp and vats use

e) blood sacrifice unfortunately consumes glow so glow mechanics are not utilized. but its not like it was very powerful either way with gatling plasma/PA, so minimal loss here

BONUS:

its not mentioned in patch notes anywhere (?) but (and if someone can confirm, maybe I was going crazy):

a) stimpacks dont restore feral meter anymore

b) you can shoot in vats and do vats crits while being feral (previously vats was blocked when feral)

c) using gimbal bracers +stabilized gives good enough accuracy with heavy guns, so you can go full feral and still do heavy guns

its not like you need access to melee with infinite vats heavy guns/gatling plasma, but kind of nice that feral is not as niche as it was before.

  
all in all I think it makes ghoul useful in raids. before the patch I probably wasted 5k atoms going ghoul and back to human and testing in raids and finally giving up and returning to humanity. now, with Blooid Sacrifice, it just works.",2,1749159647.0,fo76,0,0.75,False

My cases actually just showed up while i was getting back from my hike. This experience and reviews will start 3 days from now. I would start tomorrow but a close friend has passed away last night. 

I want to apologize again for the so called “money grab”. All i said was that if you guys would want me to spend 30 days in the woods i need to pay bills and require donations. But i also said in that same post im totally fine not doing the campout so i can still go to work and not require donations. I just thought it might be a fun thing for the community to look at everyday. 

Ive decided to allow myself one cheat item per day which will most likely be a 0 sugar monster energy since i dont like coffee.

I’m guessing it was the sugar in the drip tray that tipped them off. What started as a few stragglers turned into a full-blown invasion within a week.

I didn’t want to nuke the place with harsh chemicals especially not with pets and kids around. So I did what any stubborn homeowner does before calling in the pros: I went full DIY mode.

Here’s what worked for me (and what didn’t):

First Attempt: Cinnamon and Vinegar Spray

I saw a ton of people on here and YouTube recommending this combo.

Cinnamon is supposed to mess with their scent trails.

White vinegar wipes them out and masks the pheromones.

It kind of worked, but only temporarily. The ants just found a new route two feet over. I’d call this more of a repellent than a true solution.

What Actually Worked: The Homemade Borax Bait

This was the game changer.

I mixed:

1 part Borax (the laundry booster)

3 parts sugar

Just enough water to make a syrupy paste

I put a small blob of it on a folded index card and placed it right along their trail (out of reach of pets). The first few hours? It got swarmed. Like a tiny ant rave.

The next day: almost no ants. Within 72 hours, zero.

Why it works: Worker ants carry the bait back to the colony, which then knocks out the queen and larvae. It’s not instant but it’s super effective. Way better than just spraying and praying.

Extra Tip: Find the Entry Point

I tracked the little guys back to a tiny crack in the wall behind the sink. Sealed it up with caulk once they were gone. Haven’t seen a single one since.

What Didn’t Work for Me:

Lemon juice: Smelled nice, did nothing.

Coffee grounds: The ants walked over them like it was a red carpet.

Essential oils (peppermint): Smelled great, mildly deterred them, didn’t stop the colony.

TL;DR

Tried a few DIY tricks, but homemade Borax bait is what actually wiped them out.

Took 2–3 days to work, but solved the problem without harsh chemicals.

I sealed up the wall crack afterward to prevent new scouts from coming in.

But what i really feel pushed out by is when something that actually is meant to be about trans rights activism gets hijacked, like ""Ooh and palestine too!"" ""And we should all be vegan!"" ""And legalize weed!""

It puts me off. It's stressful enough \*gestures at everything\* without internal squabbling. This is why the rightwing win. They focus on one thing at a time and unite around it.

The first time we hung out we got coffee and since then, we’ve just gone to random events or I’ve gone over to his place. About a month ago, he told me he was falling in love with me. 

I didn’t really expect to catch feelings for him initially, but here we are. I like to consider myself a very thoughtful person, especially when I like someone—which has made me realize certain things about him. He had never gotten me flowers, or really ever asked me on a “formal” date I guess. The only times we have hung out is when we’re going to something casual or last minute, as I’ve mentioned. And I don’t say this to say that I need something fancy, but just more thought put into it? Not just a “you wanna go to this?” Or “you wanna come over?” type of thing. I actually brought this up to him a month ago, which he was very appreciative of me addressing and said he’s just been mentally occupied since he’s in the process of moving. 

I understood where he’s coming from and I can give him grace for that. I’m just wondering if things will actually change after he’s moved in. I also don’t want to settle for less than what I deserve, because my last relationship was terrible and I promised myself I would  be single forever unless someone came and blew me away. I will say he’s probably the most understanding and emotionally intelligent person I’ve ever met, it’s just the other department that’s lacking. Should I wait it out? Is this even a big enough reason to not continue talking to someone? Is it an incompatibility issue? And if things don’t change… I just don’t want to come off stuck-up because I’m not receiving a certain type of treatment but I also feel like girls like to feel special.

**Over 92,000+ Users Have Left Overwhelmingly Positive Feedback**, with many claiming this formula helped eliminate gum bleeding, reduced their dental bills, and even *whitened their teeth naturally*—all without needing expensive procedures or invasive cleanings. The buzz has grown so loud, **dentists are now starting to take notice**, with clinical-level testimonials surfacing from medical professionals praising its science-backed ingredients.

But let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. Let’s explore why so many people are calling it a “must-have” for total mouth detox and long-term dental restoration.

**What Is ProvaDent and Why Is It Disrupting the Dental Industry?**

To understand what makes **ProvaDent** such a seismic shift in the world of oral health, you need to forget everything you’ve been taught about brushing and flossing. While daily hygiene is vital, it only scratches the surface—literally. The real war for your oral health is happening below the gumline, in your **oral microbiome**.

And this is where **ProvaDent** rewrites the rules.

Unlike traditional dental products that wipe out all bacteria (good and bad) in a chemical blitz, ProvaDent is a **clinical-grade oral probiotic complex** that selectively strengthens the *beneficial bacteria* in your mouth while eradicating the destructive strains responsible for decay, gum disease, and chronic bad breath.

*Let’s break that down:*

* **It populates your mouth with billions of good bacteria** that can naturally fight cavities, detoxify enamel, and keep gums healthy without triggering inflammation.
* **It starves and destroys the bad bacteria** that thrive on sugar, create biofilm (plaque), and trigger gum recession or periodontal disease.
* It goes beyond the mouth—by influencing *gut health, cardiovascular support*, and even *immune function*, thanks to the **gut-mouth axis**.

The formulation isn’t just a blend—it’s a *precision strike*.

**What makes ProvaDent different from everything else on the market?**

Let’s start with the **BioFresh™ Clean Complex**, a proprietary enzyme matrix designed to **dissolve stubborn biofilms**—those invisible layers where bad bacteria hide. Biofilms are often *completely untouched* by brushing, which is why gum disease continues even in people with excellent oral hygiene. ProvaDent breaks down that shield, allowing good bacteria to flourish where it matters most.

*Then you’ve got:*

* **Cranberry Extract** – Clinically shown to reduce plaque adhesion and bacterial stickiness
* **4 Probiotic Strains** – Including 3.5 billion CFUs of gut-to-gum friendly flora
* **Purple Carrot Powder** – Antioxidants that support gum tissue regeneration

**Over 92,000+ Users Have Left Overwhelmingly Positive Feedback**, with many claiming this formula helped eliminate gum bleeding, reduced their dental bills, and even *whitened their teeth naturally*—all without needing expensive procedures or invasive cleanings. The buzz has grown so loud, **dentists are now starting to take notice**, with clinical-level testimonials surfacing from medical professionals praising its science-backed ingredients.

But let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. Let’s explore why so many people are calling it a “must-have” for total mouth detox and long-term dental restoration.

**What Is ProvaDent and Why Is It Disrupting the Dental Industry?**

To understand what makes **ProvaDent** such a seismic shift in the world of oral health, you need to forget everything you’ve been taught about brushing and flossing. While daily hygiene is vital, it only scratches the surface—literally. The real war for your oral health is happening below the gumline, in your **oral microbiome**.

Unlike traditional dental products that wipe out all bacteria (good and bad) in a chemical blitz, ProvaDent is a **clinical-grade oral probiotic complex** that selectively strengthens the *beneficial bacteria* in your mouth while eradicating the destructive strains responsible for decay, gum disease, and chronic bad breath.

*Let’s break that down:*

* **It populates your mouth with billions of good bacteria** that can naturally fight cavities, detoxify enamel, and keep gums healthy without triggering inflammation.
* **It starves and destroys the bad bacteria** that thrive on sugar, create biofilm (plaque), and trigger gum recession or periodontal disease.
* It goes beyond the mouth—by influencing *gut health, cardiovascular support*, and even *immune function*, thanks to the **gut-mouth axis**.

The formulation isn’t just a blend—it’s a *precision strike*.

**What makes ProvaDent different from everything else on the market?**

Let’s start with the **BioFresh™ Clean Complex**, a proprietary enzyme matrix designed to **dissolve stubborn biofilms**—those invisible layers where bad bacteria hide. Biofilms are often *completely untouched* by brushing, which is why gum disease continues even in people with excellent oral hygiene. ProvaDent breaks down that shield, allowing good bacteria to flourish where it matters most.

*Then you’ve got:*

* **Cranberry Extract** – Clinically shown to reduce plaque adhesion and bacterial stickiness
* **4 Probiotic Strains** – Including 3.5 billion CFUs of gut-to-gum friendly flora
* **Purple Carrot Powder** – Antioxidants that support gum tissue regeneration
* **Organic Xylitol** – Natural sugar substitute that actively neutralizes enamel-eroding acids

Taken daily, these ingredients **work synergistically to clean, protect, and rebuild** your mouth from the inside out.

The buzz around ProvaDent is impossible to ignore—and it's not just hype. With **over 103,000+ verified customers** and counting, this dental health breakthrough is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about oral probiotics of 2025. From fresh breath transformations to shocking cavity reversals, users are flooding online spaces with praise for this once-overlooked chewable tablet. And what’s driving the hype?

I started noticing changes in just 3 weeks—less swelling, no bleeding when I flossed, and best of all, my breath didn’t have that ‘morning rot’ anymore. I even canceled a deep-cleaning appointment my dentist recommended. ProvaDent is my go-to now.”

**Greg Tanner, 57, Plano, TX**  
“I’ve had three root canals. That’s three too many. My dentist told me I had weak enamel and that I needed to be extra aggressive with my brushing. But it never helped. I started using ProvaDent just to see if it’d make a difference—and wow. My teeth feel stronger. My breath smells fresh even after coffee. And my last dental checkup? Zero issues. For the first time in *years.*”

**Michelle Liu, 36, San Diego, CA**  
“My daughter had constant cavities, even though we monitored her sugar and brushed regularly. We decided to try ProvaDent as a family. Within two months, the difference was night and day. Her dentist said the plaque buildup had drastically reduced, and my own gum sensitivity went away completely. We’re both sleeping better now too, oddly enough. It’s like ProvaDent helped reset our whole mouth health.”

“I chew two tablets a day religiously. I used to be embarrassed by my breath—I carried mints everywhere and still felt paranoid. But ProvaDent changed that. I can talk close to people now without feeling self-conscious. The probiotics in this formula *really* work. And the best part? I haven’t had a cavity since I started.”

**Tina Lang, 63, Denver, CO**  
“I was skeptical about a ‘dental supplement’ doing anything real. But after just a month on ProvaDent, my dentist asked what I was doing differently. My gums weren’t as inflamed. My breath was fresh. And those white patches I always hated? They’re fading. I’m hooked.”

**Brandon Ellis, 29, Brooklyn, NY**  
“My job in sales means I’m always face-to-face with clients. I can’t afford to have bad breath or stained teeth. ProvaDent has completely upgraded my oral game. I pop one in the morning and one after dinner, and I swear my mouth feels fresher all day. Way more effective than mouthwash and strips.”

WASHINGTON D.C. (Worthy Satire) - In a bold press conference held in a cozy, dimly lit coffee shop filled with artisanal candles and NPR tote bags, the CEOs of NPR and PBS announced their intention to fight back against President Trump's proposed funding cuts, insisting that they’re utterly unqualified to do anything else.\
\
“I mean, what am I supposed to do? Read the news in a normal, non-whispery voice?” said NPR CEO, Carl Podcasterson, clutching a microphone like it was a life raft. “I haven’t used a regular speaking volume since the mid-90s. At this point, even my therapist needs closed captions.”\
\
PBS CEO Linda Docuworthy echoed the sentiment, waving a stack of Ken Burns documentaries in the air. “These are my resume, my references, and my emergency retirement fund,” she said. “If I’m not narrating the Civil War in slow motion, I have no viable skills. Unless there’s a sudden demand for people who can summarize a 7-hour documentary on the history of shoelaces.”\
\
The two vowed to challenge Trump's budget cuts in court, with Docuworthy adding, “If they cut us off, we might have to resort to... commercial breaks.”\
\
The room gasped. The horror.\

I took 0.25mg on the first flight and it worked wonders. We stayed at the resort for 4 days and we did drink a lot of alcohol. Then on the last day of the trip I drank the night before, felt a little hungover the next day after sleeping about 7 hours. I took my Zoloft, and an Aleve. I ate breakfast and had a coffee. Then right before getting on the flight I took 0.25mg of Xanax. As we were boarding (about 15min later) I felt dizzy, like I was going to pass out, and panicked. I immediately thought “oh no I shouldn’t have taken that” I had a pretty bad panic attack, I was extremely nauseous. I was dry heaving but never threw up. I felt so dizzy and was convinced my BP dropped. Was this just a panic attack or could it have been a reaction to the Xanax and drinking the night before?

1l4ayry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1l4ayry/tell_me_what_to_think_about_this/,Tell me what to think about this,"Here's the situation. We're coworkers, sort of, we've been working the summer months at the same job for years, about six years now? I'm 21, he's about to be 24. We've slowly developed a casual friendship, the type you do with long time coworkers. Last summer we sort of got closer, started playfully teasing each other, first playfighting over who gets to get coffee first and then about everything else too. In a sarcastic and a little mean spirited way, but also not serious at all. The workplace environment can be really frustrating and unfair, so I think it just developed as a way to let that frustration out. Bantering about things, stealing seats at the table, being a little mean as a competition; Who can make a better comeback? How long can the annoyance grow before it actually causes a reaction. It felt like a game in which both of us contributed, but I don't remember who started what which workday. It always came with sarcasm and eye-contact. One summer night there was a work related event, after which some of the employees went out, so I ended up there too. In reminisces of the pre-christmas party of the autumn before, we were gonna do karaoke again. But it was really crowded so we changed scenery, and the other coworkers headed home, but we two decided to stay. We went to order drinks, he offered to pay, and paid, both times. I was gonna venmo him my share, but he refused, so I didn't insist. We were just hanging and talking, I don't really remember what about, at some point I played with his hair a bit, casually enough. The taxi line was way too long so we decided to walk. We were joking and he started to vent about work. Like overall the conversation showed mutual respect, the frustration about our jobs, and the unfairness of the workplace (there's some misogyny) he understood all that and we both ranted about it. It was easy. It was like almost 6 o'clock when we shared a hug and went our separate ways. The workdays continued with the playful fighting and annoyance olympics. At the end of summer, (during my last workdays?) he offered to go to town for lunch along with two other employees, one being his work partner and friend, one my dear friend and coworker (we were sort of a group during that summer). I had forgotten my wallet at home, so my friend was supposed to pay my share, but in the end he did. But I also had trouble with my bank so I couldn't venmo him right away. He said something along the lines of it's not an issue, even if I never pay him, I don't have to. In the end I did pay him. I don't know if he's just loaded or something. I know he has multiple jobs, so maybe he has the money, and it could be suspected that he knew I was broke and was going to be broke since I was heading to university. I really don't know, though one of my friends heavily teased me that ""he's so down bad for you"" after I mentioned the lunch case, but I think that was an over-exaggeration of a joke to be made. During the autumn and winter we texted a few times, but it never flew to a full on conversation. He took a long time to respond (so I matched that energy) and the texts overall felt rather dry. Maybe he just always texts like an old man, he's not really active in social media overall. Also, as I mentioned, he works multiple jobs so he could've been busy. So we sort of ended up going no contact. He still liked my Instagram posts but we didn't talk or spontaneously see each other when I was in town. My birthday was during spring, so he sent me birthday wishes through snapchat (snap does send reminder notifications about birthdays), along with a question that he heard that I will return to the job this summer (I wasn't going to, but I had found no other employment for the summer, so I had called our manager). It was framed as a question, though he had to have known already, since he was working there during the spring and our manager would definitely share the news. I confirmed that I would be working this summer. I didn't ask about him, since the message was framed in a way that already told me he was going to be there. I've been back at work for a few weeks now. The playful banter is back along with the eye-contact, and it feels we're always smiling when we're looking at each other. And when I'm about to laugh, I think he's waiting for me to fold and look away, like it's a new game too? We still bully each other, and look at each other as if we share some secret that no one else knows about? But also sometimes I think he's deliberately ignoring me, like he's leaving me out of morning greetings and goodbyes at the end of the day, he's avoiding casual gestures. I mean, I also ignore him at times, because I don't really know what to think. Like are we friends or what? Friends keep in touch, don't they? Friends don't need to bully each other when they want to interact, because now it's either that or just cold hard professionalism (only with smirks and grins if we make eye-contact, so we sometimes don't)? I feel silly, stupid, a little angry and confused at all times, snd I don't know what to make of this. I'm overthinking everything and my hypervigilange takes away from casual interactions. Like I avoid him so I don't have to figure out the rhythm to this. Am I just projecting? Is this just normal coworker-friend-ish behavior?

This is my second month on the job. I have this coworker who is probably one of the best colleagues I have ever worked with. He is well-liked and well-respected in the workplace. No one speaks poorly about him, not a word. Examples of his comradeship is adjusting the standing desk tables to where they were positioned before as he knows who's coming in (he's 6 ft 4), apologizes for things that are out of his control - orders used to have to be done at 4 am but now done at 6 am which is when shift change happens so he apologizes for not doing them - but no one is of course holding him to do the orders since he is off his shift at 6 am. Other examples, are staying on top of his cleaning duties where the workplace is how it was left, which is spotless and doing ALL of the maintenance (which is normally split up by coworkers). 

I'll ask him a question on how to do something, and he responds as though I am 'letting him know' he missed that and this is not the case, at all. If there is anything amiss, it is a one-off and in no way in hell I will ever bring it up. Again, I have only worked at this job two months in and think it is normal to ask questions. 

There are some things that Rick says to my face that gives me a pause, literally. Upon first meeting him he joked that I thought I was ""better than everyone"". I am reserved and do enjoy keeping to myself, so this was perhaps a perception although more of an assumption. He has made guesses of me working at a bigger facility in large cities (LA, NYC, etc) which I did tell him was an assumption but is true, and has told me that ""You know I was joking when I said you thought you were better than other people, but wow you really think you do"". He has told me that ""all it takes is one bad worker who is hired, our department's reputation would go down""'. He is a sociable guy and has a positive rapport with the other departments, and will seek them out and have breaks with them. I have not actively made an effort to meet people in otther depts (as I know they are working, at their desks, and I prefer keeping to myself) but say hi to them upon passing. Rick has told me in situations when asking him questions ""that I might just throw him underneath the bus"" or ""Don't get me in trouble by telling on me"". Rick has stated ""that I look for mistakes"" and that if there is any that I do find (never!), to let him know. 

The most concerning statement was today when he said ""You drink coffee everyday and every facility you go to, you are the problem"". I did not say anything, and said nothing at all. He later told me that ""A patient is dead because of you since you struggled with him yesterday"". I told Rick yesterday that all of my coworkers and myself could not start a line yesterday and had to use ultrasound. These two, I found hurtful and at the point where his jokes/slight digs aren't just jokes or slight digs. I understand that it was a bad day for him, but these statements were not appropriate at a workplace. 

Backstory about Rick is that he was unfairly fired at this job several years ago, worked in a neighboring facilty, then was asked to come back a few years later. He has worked at these two facilities both in rural areas. He has admitted that he feels that he has to 'recompensate', but I feel as though there is some fear and yes, paranoia. He is unfortunately stuck at this area (personal family reasons) where he cannot leave; hence, admits that he tries to make everyone happy and has made an effort to make it work for the best. He has met some coworkers in the past; Karen, who ""apparently liked to look and create problems and was a pot-stirrer"". These were his words. She had also pushed/ran off other colleagues for years. Karen also said some poor, false, negative things about his work ethic when he tried to work at a neighboring facility, and this erroded his trust. Karen and the other(s) are no longer here. 

I just left a workplace that had multiple Karen(s). I understand his fears but my paranoia is also kicking in a little. The blade 'cuts both ways'. I have only spoken about positive things about my coworkers, barely talked about my personal life but shared tid-bits (as i've been told i'm not personable), and avoid my manager like the plague, the only communication I have with her is when inventory runs low.

There has never been any infidelity on either end. When we moved into our current apartment last year, my wife befriended a couple up the hall, Anna and Sarah. Anna has the view of ""all men are horrible monsters."" She's entitled to her opinion and I get where she's coming from to some extent.

Over Memorial Day weekend, my wife left town to visit some family. On Friday night, I went to the corner store and got myself a 6 pack of beer, hopped on discord with a buddy, and painted some Warhammer 40k figures. Before I started painting, I took my ring off to avoid getting any primer, paint, etc on it.

I forgot to put my ring back on before bed. The next morning I went out to get some coffee and ran into Anna and Sarah on my way back in, chatted for maybe 2 minutes. 10 minutes later my wife calls me and asks why I'm not wearing my ring. I tell her that I must have forgotten to put it back on after painting. I also asked her how she knew I wasn't wearing it. Apparently, Anna took a picture of me while we were speaking and sent it to my wife with a message that basically said ""The first time you go out of town and his ring off. He's probably cheating on you"" 

My wife immediately believes me and told me as much. Just to ensure there were no doubts, I sent her my location history showing the only time I left the apartment on Friday was to get beer and a picture of my work-in-progress figures (Custodes, IYKYK).

My wife returned Monday and told me the following. After we spoke on the phone she messaged Anna saying that she appreciates being looked after, but that I wasn't up to anything nefarious and had even provided proof. Anna replied that I likely had this all planned out and had my 'proof' at the ready and only had to use it because I 'got caught.' I ask my wife, what would Anna like to see to prove that I basically spent my Friday night doing the OPPOSITE of cheating? I feel a bit attacked and offered for Anna to come over and read the discord chat history between my buddy and I, which is full of back-and-forth links and 40k pictures from 7pm until midnight when I logged off. My wife says I'm turning this into nothing, and insisting I'm innocent is only going to make Anna dig in her heels.

Next weekend they are having a picnic and Sarah invited us. I tell my wife that she should go without me, I don't feel like spending any time around Anna, who clearly does not respect me and thinks I'm a serial cheater with no morals. I don't want to spend the afternoon getting the side-eye from her, and I have some anxiety that she's going to (or already has been) gossipping about me. My wife thinks I should extend an olive branch by coming to the picnic with some cookies and telling Anna that I appreciate that she's looking out for my wife, but nothing happened. I feel like I did nothing wrong and that getting back in Anna's good graces is not warrented. AITA for not just smoothing things over?",302,1749158306.0,AmItheAsshole,249,0.97,False

How do you do it?,"Our first and only son is now two. When he was born I had a pretty stable job working for a reputable company here in the UK. I was allowed to be flexible with my hours as long as I did 8 hours a day, so I used to opt for 6am - 2pm to support my partner with housework and childcare in the afternoons and evenings and it worked.

Though a few months after he was born, I decided to quit and start my own business. I started out doing courier work where I was up and down the country daily, the hours were long, tiring and home time differed everyday, but we managed to make it work. 

But then problems started arising where on my quieter days and/or weekends, I’d be sat on my laptop at home doing admin work. Catching up on my bookkeeping, taxes, uploading receipts, invoicing etc. I’d hear my partner struggling with our son, and naturally I’ve then broken off from what I was doing to try and help, but then I’ve ended up getting behind on things, the work builds up and it becomes difficult.


This year the business has grown so much, and there’s so much computer work that needs doing, but it’s so difficult with a toddler. If I’m on my laptop he’ll come and tap the buttons or try to crawl on it, or run his cars across it. Or sometimes he’ll grab my hand and pull me and wanting me to go and play with him and how can I say no? I don’t want to be that dad that was always “too busy” for his son. He’s growing up too fast it’s scary. And then if he’s not playing, I’m hearing him kicking off at my partner and/or her struggling with him that I can’t just leave them to struggle. 

I realised a few weeks ago when they went away for a few days with my partner’s friend and her son, just how much I’m struggling to work. With an empty house I achieved so much, and since they’ve come back I’ve ended up so behind again. Even just today I’ve sat with them on my laptop and he’s been the most misbehaved we’ve both ever seen him, so I’ve broke off an awful lot to help there. 

I’ve thought about visiting cafes/coffee shops to work from, but at the minute I’d be there for days. Eventually it will calm down again but at the minute it’s mad. We’re also putting him into nursery in September and my partner is going to start working for the business, so that could be easier. We’re also looking at taking on an office and warehouse unit later on this year or into the new year which would also give me more space. 

But just for now I’m wondering how on earth other dad’s manage to work from home?

I have a pretty standard PCOS diagnosis story - found out as a young teenager and was then on contraception for over 12 years.

Until then, I’m on a hormonal health journey trying to ease my symptoms and get a regular period back!

•	⁠I came off contraception 6ish months ago and have taken myoinositol religiously since.
•	⁠Seed cycled for 6 months.
•	⁠Tried to stick to a whole foods diet, with a high protein breakfast. (I used to fast and just have a coffee in the mornings but I’ve stopped doing that now). I’m not overweight and have always eaten quite well but I’ve tried to step it up a notch.
•	⁠I’ve just started on the Flo app (where you take your temp each day) to see if I’m ovulating - I’ve only done this for a week so not seen anything so far.

In the past 6 months since coming off contraception I’ve had 3 periods, which isn’t a bad start. Does anyone have advice for what’s worked for them?

Honestly, it’s becoming really frustrating. There are so many mechs using stasis that I constantly feel frozen in place or stuck, and it’s taking the fun out of the game for me. It feels like I’m being hit from every direction with stasis effects all the time, it’s honestly kind of ridiculous. At this point, I’m starting to wonder if I should just carry around a coffee mug that says “Frozen in Time.” It might suit my current gameplay experience better, rather than actually improving my coffee drinking experience, I’d much rather be in motion than perpetually stuck in the same spot.

It’s gotten to the point where playing feels more like a chore than enjoyment. I’ve spent time and resources on equipment, only to see it degrade and seem less useful, especially as the game appears to be nerfing things more and more. Honestly, it’s like trying to build a sandcastle while a tide of nerfs keeps washing everything away. Makes me question whether I should keep investing my time and money, since progress feels blocked or less rewarding.

Perhaps this is known and this is how it’s supposed to be, but honestly, it just seems like nonsense. It’s really hard to enjoy the game when it feels like these mechanics are just creating more frustration rather than fun. Who knew that freezing every five seconds could be so entertaining?

I wish I could say something positive about the game right now, but I’m just feeling pretty disappointed. Is it even realize by the DEVS how these mechanics are affecting the player experience? I really want to keep enjoying the game, but right now, it’s tough.

Thanks for listening.

## key Features Analysis

Pink lava lamps, while sharing a common aesthetic, differ substantially in their technical specifications, materials, and overall build quality.

**height and Size:** The dimensions of a lava lamp are critical depending on how it will fit in your space.

Pink lava lamps typically range in height from 14.5 inches to over 20 inches.Smaller lamps are ideal for desks,shelves,or bedside tables,while larger versions can make a bolder statement on the floor or a larger surface. Consider the overall scale of your room and other decorative elements to ensure the lamp complements the space without overwhelming it. Measure your intended placement area before purchasing.

**Wax flow and Clarity:** The mesmerizing movement of wax is the defining characteristic of a lava lamp.

The wax should flow smoothly and dynamically within the glass globe. Look for lamps where the wax separates into distinct blobs that gracefully rise and fall, rather than clumping together in an unappealing mass. The clarity of the liquid within the globe is equally crucial. A cloudy liquid can diminish the visual impact of the wax flow, while a crystal-clear liquid allows the pink wax to shine vibrantly. High-quality lamps use specially formulated wax and carefully filtered liquid to achieve optimal flow and clarity.

**Bulb Wattage and Type:** The bulb is the engine that fuels the lava lamp's mesmerizing motion.

The bulb's wattage determines the amount of heat generated, which in turn affects the speed and intensity of the wax flow. Most pink lava lamps use incandescent spotlight bulbs, typically ranging from 25 to 40 watts. Higher wattage bulbs will heat the wax more quickly and create a more dynamic flow. Ensure the bulb you select is compatible with the lamp's voltage and base type. Also, consider the longevity of the bulb and its energy consumption, as you may want to factor in replacement costs.

**Base and Cap Material:** The base and cap not only provide structural support but also contribute to the lamp's overall aesthetic.The base and cap can be made from a variety of materials, including metal, plastic, and even wood. Metal bases, such as aluminum or steel, tend to be more durable and provide a stable foundation. Plastic bases are frequently enough lighter and more affordable, but they might potentially be less resistant to wear and tear. The finish on the base and cap can also considerably impact the lamp's appearance. Look for finishes that complement the pink wax and the overall decor of your room.

**Glass Globe Quality:** The glass globe encases the entire process and creates the viewing experience.

The quality of the glass globe is also essential. It should be free from bubbles, scratches, or imperfections that could detract from the visual experience. Thicker glass can also provide better durability and heat resistance. Some lamps use colored glass to further enhance the pink hue of the wax, creating a more saturated and vibrant effect. Examine the glass carefully to ensure it's free of flaws.

**Heating Time:**

The time it takes for the lava lamp to fully heat up and for the wax to start flowing. This can vary depending on the wattage of the bulb and the ambient temperature of the room. Ideally, the lamp should reach its peak flow rate within one to two hours.

## FAQs Section

The following are frequently asked questions about pink lava lamps.

**How long does it take for a pink lava lamp to heat up?**
Typically, a pink lava lamp takes between one to three hours to fully heat up and for the wax to start flowing properly. The exact time can vary depending on the lamp's wattage, the ambient temperature, and the initial conditions of the wax.**Can I leave my pink lava lamp on all the time?**
While it is indeed technically possible to leave a lava lamp on continuously, it is not recommended. Prolonged use can lead to overheating and potential damage to the lamp's components, including the bulb and the wax. It is best to turn off the lamp after a few hours of use to allow it to cool down.

**What type of bulb does a pink lava lamp use?**

Most pink lava lamps use a reflector bulb, or R bulb. The wattage varies from 25W to 40W. The bulb type used helps to create the heat needed to push the wax without being too shining.
**What should I do if the wax in my pink lava lamp is not flowing properly?**
If the wax in your pink lava lamp is not flowing properly, there are a few things you can try. First, make sure that the lamp is placed on a level surface and that it is not exposed to drafts or direct sunlight. Second, check that the bulb is working correctly and that it is the correct wattage for the lamp. Third,give the lamp time to fully heat up. If the wax still does not flow properly after a few hours, try gently rotating the globe upside down to redistribute the wax. If none of these steps work, then you can frequently enough replace the bulb to help solve the problem.

In the spirit of giving, here’s my take on QC Spa on Governors Island. Take what you need to hear and leave the rest 🩷

I went with two girl friends in May on a Saturday afternoon and opted for the 3-hour spa pass. Yes, that was the only warm and sunny Saturday that month. 

Things we loved/appreciated: 🥰
-Easy check in, pay on the spot instead of advance, staff there to greet you. 
-During check in you’re given a wristband with your locker # & floor # listed. Option to add your credit card for easy food/drink purchases
-Given a tote that includes your robe, towels, & flip flops (more on the footwear later..)
-Outdoors pools/lounges were spacious, comfortable, and awesome NYC view! Several different saunas throughout, but didn’t use many because the weather was fantastic and we stayed outside most of the time.
-Overall very clean & staff often making sure it stayed clean
-Water available everywhere + free coffee & hot tea
-Skincare (Sothy’s) & shower products available + Dyson hairdryers in locker rooms
-The Aperol Spritz was solid but $$$ (didn’t care it’s my self care day)

Things I wasn’t impressed with: 😒
The space itself and the number of people they allow in at a time…
-Size of the locker room. So many lockers so close together is just unpleasant. Two bathroom stalls for close to 100 lockers in there. And 3 shower stalls. Sorry y’all could do better. 
-Inside the building felt like a museum. A tiny museum. Where your walkways are narrow and you’re constantly having to navigate around people. Or you have to wait for groups to walk through a doorway in order to pass by. This is where the spa felt the most crowded. Again not the most pleasant. 
-Flip flops provided? Yes. Will they fit? No. When you check in you’re given any pair without being asked your size. They clearly have 3 different sizes marked with a colored sticker. This we realized while walking around and seeing others like us flopping around or hanging out of their shoes. WFT. 

All in all we had a great afternoon, mostly because of the company we keep and our love for a good pool with a view. Is it worth the cost? Up for debate. Hopefully this helps you make a more informed decision. At the very least you’ll know what to expect! ",11,1749157534.0,NYCbitcheswithtaste,10,1.0,False

👋﻿ **What's up, worlds? Y'all can call me CD!**

* Hi, hey, and howdy! The name's CD, and I'm a 27 y/o lady from southeast USA (EST / EDT) with way too many concepts and not enough emojis to describe them all. I'm also an artist, animator, content creator, and I'm perpetually on the hunt for writing partners interested in taking a spin!

🤝﻿﻿ **What am I currently looking for in a partner?**

* Do you like plotting with a good ratio of tension, action, fluff, and angst? Give me the drama!

🙌 **What kind of settings and genres do I enjoy**?

* Supernatural, Modern Fantasy, and Science-Fiction!
* Premade OCs! I love some old and loved characters!
* A healthy dose of mystery and relaxation downtime!

# STORYLINE

﻿﻿⌛ **Learn about Harrison Graves, the librarian!**

* Harrison Graves is an overqualified librarian by day and a hound for the supernatural at night. Too resilient for his own good, or just unnaturally unlucky, he's come out more mean being among monsters, and when it comes down to the wire, he'll do what's right if it remains convenient.
* The character has over twelve years of development, and he's been and done a lot of things. To start, he was a professor. After that, he delved into the sciences. Some time later, he became a mobster. Nowadays, he works at a library... most of the time, but old habits die harder than he does!
* I'll try to keep this simple and conventional, but I love it when Harrison is bullied or otherwise dunked on. Friends? Of course. Foes? For sure. The best kind of relationships with this character tend to be reluctant allies or even enemies-to-friends. Bonus points are given if the ally is a feisty young lady!

🌃 **Enter the fictional mega-city of Los Lunares!**

* Los Lunares is a mega-city situated on the largest harbor in Oregon, USA. Crime runs rampant, as do powered vigilantes. Each thing that goes bump in the night claws for its own piece of the city while the supernatural elite tighten their control with an iron fist, ready to bleed everything dry!,
* Even though mundane humans are by far the most numerous citizens, everyone is aware that vampires, werewolves, and people in flashy costumes exist... but don't fuss about it unless they're actively crashing through their houses. Even then, much remains that the inhabitants are unaware of!

📔 **What are some of my plots and prompts?**

* Assist in a job given by the main monster mobsters to erase a debt to the lord of the land.
* Escape captivity from the local man-eating gangsters after a bounty is put on their heads.
* Take down a string of cult-related summonings in the middle of spooky autumn festivities.
* Work with the law and criminals alike to disrupt a new crime trade that's invading the city.

💥 **See something you like? Ask me about it!**

* I'm also open to other ideas, plots, and prompts. Those are just there to gauge your interest!

# EPILOGUE

💬 **Interested? Please send me a message!**

* Include a little about yourself in your introduction! The more effort, the better. I'd also love to hear what may have caught your interest, as well as any characters you feel would be a good match. Once we hit it off, I might ask for some sample writing. All good? Contact me when you're ready!

Insects chirping and dancing among the concrete ruins of capitalism signaled the arrival of dusk. For some reason or another, Harrison imagined that the afterhours of the Deep Dish Diner in Los Lunares would’ve been more lively, but nope – not at all. That was fine, though. As one might have imagined, a man with the last name of ‘Graves’ didn’t do ‘lively’ very well.

Nighttime was meant for reading, obviously. A pair of rectangular reading glasses sat on the bridge of his nose, looking down at the first book in a two-part series that he’d probably read a dozen times over, just to relax in the familiarity of it all if nothing else.

Harrison already knew how it’d all end. The woman that fell through the mirror would end up with the lovable young man that brought her through the multiverse by accident.

A story with a happy ending? Imagine that.

The waitress approached the bar counter. “What can I get’chu, hun?” she asked.

Country-fried steak? Chicken with gravy? Grand slam hamburger? None of these happened to appeal to his tastes at the moment, given the string of missing-turned-mutilated persons he’d had been lightly eyeing on the side for the past few weeks. It wasn’t his business, really… until higher powers made it so.

Harrison took one more glance at the menu and exhaled through his nose, trading any convictions he may have had about a diet for a breath of air. “A caramel blend shake.”

With a nod, she jotted down the request and pinned it to the dwindling roster of orders before taking her leave to attend elsewhere.

In retrospect, a milkshake probably wasn’t the best item to choose if he didn’t want to raise his cholesterol, but that one sweet tooth had other plans. The drive from Rowanwick to Los Lunares may not have been a particularly rigorous one – filled with ghastly eyes peering from the treeline, yes –  but he’d be damned if he did so without getting something good out of it.

For once, things were okay.

People came and went. Few lingered, likely weighed down by their own troubles or perhaps simply enjoying a coffee near the witching hour, both of which he’d become rather accustomed to on his own time. Harrison casually flicked a page between his fingers, his gaze fixated on the material of his mental escape as he waited.

The true problem? Things were not okay. In fact, things were so completely not okay that no one seemed to notice the glaring problem coming into view from the depths of the fog outside.

Under nightfall, it hunted. Like lightning, it struck. As the darkest day of the year crept further from its hole and upon man, so did the monsters that hid beneath its belly. Heavy footfalls echoed down the increasingly empty streets, followed by the rush of crisp autumnal winds carrying the faint chorus of thunder. Some would've called it ominous. The man known as Harrison Graves, however, found it far more terrifying.

Shallow gasps intermingled with a light pattering of rain, each of their steps sending an upheaval of grimy water, but dirtied boots were the least of his worries as his partner got snapped into the air like a ragdoll. Any pleas or screams she may have had lingering on the tip of her tongue were quickly silenced as a sickening splatter of crimson wetted the pavement.

No time to care nor any inkling of pity for the woman was present. With an increased drive to survive, the man rushed past a fallen street light, which had the unfortunate effect of leaving whatever followed in the dark, its winged shadow beating furiously for blood.

Up ahead lied an abandoned fishery – the designated safehouse for his people (although he loathed to call them such) and their endeavors. “Iron!” the man blurted, arms flailing and seemingly insane as he made his approach. “It doesn’t like iron!”

Fortunately, someone heard him. Unfortunately, they didn't listen. One of the guards, a boorish man of impressive size, slipped out from behind one of the old delivery garages. A war cry bellowed from his throat, loud enough to rival the excessive number of shots that cracked through the night at a near-invisible foe.

Harrison took this opportunity to dive inside the relative safety of the fishery just as his meathead friend laid his eyes on the last light he’d ever see. Neither tooth nor claw saw to his end, but rather a brilliant beam of lightning. Whoever he was mattered about as much as his smoldering remains did now.

The lone survivor of the ordeal slumped against an old crate and clutched at his heart, chest heaving as he attempted to regain his bearings. As good luck would have it, he wasn’t alone. “Anyone got a brain cell left?!” Harrison wheezed, eyeing the menagerie of allied faces – some of which were monstrous – between breaths. “I want every rusty nail and rod pulled out and shoved down that thing’s throat, and–!”

Something of a coughing fit hacked its way up his throat – a testament to just how not-used to all this extraneous activity the man was. “–You!” he continued, pointing a finger at the odd woman out. “The boss seems to think you’re worth something, so let’s put that to good use. Bring it down,” he commanded.

I've noticed a majority of niche roasters here in Portland have gone down the light & fruity roast rabbit hole lately. While that is absolutely fine and I do appreciate it, I would greatly prefer a really solid old-school medium roast with those lovely dark & rich flavors we used to be crazy about in the early 2000s. Guatemalas, Nicaraguas, etc.  
Remember Hairbender when it first came out? Something like that.

Where in town has something in that vein?  
Or maybe suggestions that turned you in to a fruit-forward coffee lover?

I'm based in Berlin, currently in the early stages of building a SaaS product targeting the music industry. Having served as a Managing Director at a SaaS startup here, I'm now pursuing my own venture and actively seeking a technical co-founder, ideally based in SF.

I'll be visiting San Francisco for the first time for two weeks at the beginning of July. I'm using YC's co-founder matching tool, but haven't seen a way to specifically connect with potential co-founders located in SF.

I'd love your advice on:

* How to best connect with potential technical co-founders in SF (particularly through YC channels).
* Opportunities to meet people from YC, or attend community events during my visit.
* Tips for navigating and understanding the SF startup ecosystem as a first-timer.

Open to coffee chats, meetups, or recommendations for must-attend events!

Thanks in advance—really excited to explore SF and the YC community!

(Romance)","I started writing this to get some complex feelings off my own chest and ... well... I guess I got carried away and it turned into something fictional which I quite enjoyed. It's an excerpt but would like some feedback. Shall I keep going with it?

-

""Alice... we need to talk"" He had a look on his face that she didn't recognise. Worry? Fear? Whatever it was it made her uneasy.

""Professor? Is everything OK?""

""Sit, please.""

She obeyed, placing her books on the corner of his desk. ""Is something wrong?""

""No ... Well... No. It's... nothing to worry about."" His voice faltered.

""OK?""

He took a deep breath. ""Alice. I ... I can't tutor you anymore. I'm sorry.""

Alice whinced - in pain and confusion. ""What? What do you mean?""

The look she gave him shattered him. ""Alice... it's just... become ... complicated."" He struggled to get the words out, ""I'm finding it hard to ... remain ... objective.""

Alice stayed silent and held his gaze, forcing him to elaborate.

His eyes flicked towards the floor and back towards her ""Alice...I... my feelings... they are not..."" His voice faltered and he gulped, taking a moment to regain composure. ""my feelings for you have crossed the line of what's appropriate and I cant keep this up. Not in good conscience.""

Alice let out a hollow laugh. All those weeks of tension built up to the most lacklustre confession. After all the heat from last week's sessions, this was the last thing she expected.

She stared through him whole responding, her tone flat, ""So... you're dumping me.""

""What? No. Alice... this is the opposite of dumping you. I’m doing this because I care. Too damn much.""

Her eyes rolled in frustration and landed squarely on his. ""Same outcome, Frank. I lose you either way.""

He jolted slightly; he hadn't heard her use his name since that night in the summer. It rattled him. She wasn't talking to him as her professor anymore. She was talking to him as a man.

""Alice, I have no choice. You are my studentand I have to respect that.'

""Except I'm not your student now, am I? I've lost you both professionally and personally. This isn't fair!"". Her voice cracked slightly, and she hated herself for it. She looked down at the floor, breathing heavily.

""Alice please. This isn't rejection. I am just trying to do the right thing in an impossible situation.""

“I get it, Professor. I do. But it doesn’t make it hurt any less.”

The way she said Professor — like it burned her mouth — made him wince.

“This is killing me too, Alice. Please don’t think it isn’t… But I know you are going to fly with or without me. I am sure of it.""

She laughed again, more bitterly this time. ""I didn't want to fly, Frank, I wanted to fall.""

Her words, eloquent, poetic, and so very quintessentially Alice, tore through his heart. She shook her head. in disbelief, and stood, grabbing her notebook.

As she turned to go, he stood up.

“Alice…”

He grabbed her arm, and she froze.

He stepped closer, not thinking, just aching. One hand on her wrist. One on her shoulder now, turning her back towards him.

Her chest rose and fell — fast, and heavy, filled with rage and desire. His breath caught as he stood in front of her, fighting his every instinct to give in, to take what he wanted ... he leaned forward and pressed his forehead against hers, eyes closed like it hurt to open them.

She allowed herself to lean in against him.

“I’m sorry,” he whispered, ragged.

She felt the warmth radiating from his body and her skin burned beneath his touch.

She took a step back and looked at him, “So am I,” she whispered.

Then she slipped from his grip — gently, deliberately — and walked out without another word.

He didn’t follow.

He couldn’t.

He sat back down and slumped over his desk, cradling his head in his hands as though it was the only way to keep upright.

He had braced himself for his own heartbreak, but he hadn’t been prepared for hers - for the hurt in her eyes, the bitterness in her voice.

It was a punch to the gut. And it shattered him.

The integrity he prided himself on felt fickle - pathetic. The truth was that he had already crossed the line, it had just happened so gradually that he hadn’t even noticed. He didn’t know when exactly they stopped being tutor and student — and became something else entirely.

And what now?

Now he was alone in a room where the smell of the perfume on her skin still lingered – floral, musky, faint - and it felt like every choice he’d made led him here. To this desk. This silence. This searing absence.

His breath hitched, sharp and unexpected.

He pressed his palms to his eyes, like he could force back the image of her walking away — shoulders squared, composed and resolute.

What was the point of doing the right thing if it felt like this? If it hurt her anyway? If it ruined something before it even had the chance to begin?

He wished he could go back to the moment when he almost lost control - when every cell in his body ached for him to kiss her. Not to change it - he knew that wasn't an option - but just to hold it for a little longer. The feel of her body so close to his. The charged breath between restraint and surrender. The electricity of almost.

He knew he should never have let her in.

But God — he also knew, unequivocally — that he couldn't have stopped it even he wanted to.

Her words echoed in his ears

""I didn't want to fly, Frank, I wanted to fall"".

But the truth was

they already had.


Back at her flat that evening, Alice sat curled on the sofa, legs pulled to her chest, hoodie sleeves stretched over her hands. Her cheeks tear-stained and her eyes raw. She heard Becca bounce through the door. She grabbed the used tissues she'd left on the coffee table and hid them in her pocket in a vain attempt to mask her misery.

Becca walked into the room, took one look at her, and sat down on the sofa beside her and waited, without saying a word.

Alice looked at her, her voice weak, “He ended it. He's … stepping back as my tutor.”

Becca didn’t ask why. She didn’t need to.

“Oh, babe.”

“I mean—” Alice’s voice cracked again, throat tight with rage. “It's so stupid! It wasn’t even a relationship, was it?! Yet somehow, it was. And now it’s over before it began. And I feel like someone’s just ripped something out of me - something I never really had in the first place.”

Becca listened quietly – giving Alice the space to vent.

Her thoughts continued to flood through her. “I don’t even know what I am feeling - whether I’m angry at him, at myself or at the... the universe! This situation!”

She let out an exasperated sigh. “I get it Becca, I do - he is my tutor! It's not appropriate! I knew that, he knew that, we all knew that. We tried to keep it cool but somehow, we still just … let it happen. We just kept tripping over all those damn lines!”

She shook her head as she processed her feelings “But it wasn't just me who pushed it, Becca. That gig over summer, the innuendos, his confession last week. Eugh, that was all him. And then— he tells me he can’t be my tutor anymore because he’s too— I don't know ... Conflicted!” She spat out the word before breaking down. “Well, whose fault is that?!”

She wiped her face with her sleeve, furious at herself for crying again.

Becca placed a hand over Alice’s. “I’m so sorry,” she said, gently. “Of course it was a relationship, Alice. You've both been dancing around this for a year now.”

Alice leaned her head back, eyes looking to the ceiling.

“There was a moment today, as I got up to leave his office... I am sure he almost kissed me. We were so… close Becca. It's going to haunt me forever.”

Becca smiled sadly. “He cares about you Alice. Ironically, he wouldn't be doing this if he didn't.”

Alice sighed. “So, I can't even have him as a mentor now. I'd rather he didn't care - at least that way I get to keep some part of him! It's not fair Becca.” Alice laughed coldly. “And the worst thing is, it just makes me respect him even more. Because I know this is the only ethical decision he could take. Screw him and his fucking irresistible integrity.”

Becca watched her, thoughfully ""What if he had kissed you, Alice? Then what?""

“Then...” Alice faltered. She closed her eyes, breathing out slowly. She paused before continuing, “Then he wouldn't be the guy I've fallen for.”

She looked up, voice quieter now. “And I wouldn’t be the person I want to be either. Not really.”

A pause. The truth settled into her like a leaf falling to the ground.

“I need to know I earned what I’ve worked for. That I was chosen for my writing, and not because someone fell for me.”

She sat up straighter, wiping her cheeks. The air in the room felt a little lighter now that she had found a new perspective. The realisation that the kiss she so longed for was impossible.

“God. I needed that.” She sighed “Thanks for letting me offload Becca”

Becca smiled gently ""What are friends for?""

Alice looked up, still tearful but in control now. “And now I need wine.”

“On it,” Becca said, already heading towards the kitchen.

We can accept that height, irrespective of other factors, can cause a man to be overlooked by many women. If you were lucky enough to hit/exceed 6'0, it is just true that that plays into your success. Had the gene coin toss gone the other way, this calm air of ""relax, you'll find one"" would fall apart very quickly.

Similarly, I was told this morning by a 17 year old that a girlfriend isn't that important. He later mentioned that he gets approached 2-3 times a month, independent of the approaches he makes himself - we know generally women are less likely to approach, so imagine how objectively far along the attractiveness curve this guy has to be. The fact is, if we wasn't the tall popular kid he purported to be, he'd be equally as frustrated as me. (Yes, this interaction got to me. Because I basically cross-examined him and slowly he revealed he was tall and popular and it was like, ""Dude, HOW are you not putting the pieces together?"").

We don't accept this in other arenas, by the way. We don't accept it when baby boomers tell us we could afford housing if we drank less coffee and unsubscribed from Netflix - instead, we point out the vastly better economic conditions they had. And that had they been in the same position, they'd have complained too.

It hunts for better deals and similar alternatives while you shop on Amazon, Walmart, Target, etc., and checks eBay in the background to see if there’s a better price or smarter alternative.

I noticed how often the exact same product is cheaper on eBay but goes unnoticed. So the goal was to surface that automatically. Think of it like a second set of eyes when you shop.

I initially started with basic keyword matching, but it returned terrible results. So I built a system that parses the product intent using NLP and reformulates a search to get closer to the exact match or similar alternatives.

It runs in the background and injects a popup if something relevant is found — early users have already saved a lot of money on products like home appliances, electronics, fashion etc.

It’s free to download. Still in beta (just launched this weekend), and I’d really appreciate any honest feedback.

The ""Cross-Platform"" Lie ""Play anywhere! With anyone!"" they screamed. ""It's universal!"" Bullshit! What it is, is universally broken! Oh, sure, I can play with my cousin on his janky-ass phone, but only if we're both prepared for blocks to not break, for mobs to glitch through walls, or for one of us to randomly plummet into the void because the chunks decided to take a goddamn coffee break! ""Cross-platform"" is just a fancy marketing term for ""cross-your-fingers-and-hope-it-doesn't-crash-again!""

And the redstone, you ask? The redstone in Bedrock isn't just inconsistent; it's a goddamn middle finger to anyone who ever spent a second trying to understand logic! You build a simple circuit, a simple piston door, something that would work flawlessly in Java, and this piece of shit version just looks at you. It works sometimes. It works on Tuesdays if the moon is full and you're wearing purple socks. It's not redstone; it's a cosmic joke designed to make you question your own sanity! If you're a redstoner, Bedrock isn't a challenge; it's a goddamn insult!

And don't even get me started on the fucking Marketplace! ""Hey, want this cool skin? Pay us! Want a basic texture pack that should be free? Fork over your cash! Want a goddamn world that barely functions? BUY OUR MINECOINS, YOU MORON!"" It's not a marketplace; it's a digital shakedown! They took the soul of community creativity, wrapped it in a bow, and slapped a price tag on it. Why create amazing free content when Mojang can just funnel every goddamn penny through their corporate greed machine? It's insulting to creators and highway robbery for players!

And the bugs? Oh, the bugs! This game isn't just buggy; it's a goddamn infestation! Phantom hits from mobs you can't even see, random crashes that send you back to the stone age, blocks reappearing after you break them like some demonic reanimation ritual! Every single session is a lottery of glitches, a constant reminder that you're playing a game held together with spit and broken dreams. It's not a game; it's a goddamn beta that they decided to charge full price for!

And that user interface? It's like it was designed by someone who hates people with hands. Every menu is a chore, every inventory management task feels like trying to knit a sweater with boxing gloves on. It's clunky, it's inefficient, and it's a constant source of rage. This isn't just bad design; it's a deliberate act of digital terrorism against anyone trying to navigate it with a mouse and keyboard!

So yeah, Bedrock Edition. It's a cross-platform Frankenstein's monster of glitches, greedy monetization, and soul-crushing inconsistencies. It's not just a game; it's a goddamn infuriating experience that makes me want to scream every time I hear someone say, ""But it's Minecraft!"" No, it's Bedrock, and it's an insult to everything good about the original!

We have been married about 6 months, and we have been in marriage counseling for several issues from both of us. This is a long one so buckle up. 

While dating there were a few times where my husband blew past my boundaries, and I became upset. Most of these boundaries have to do with food and it hasn't gotten better so I'm considering locking up the food I buy with my money. You may need some background so I'm going to provide some examples. 

**Example one:** 

It took a few months for me to allow my then boyfriend to stay over at my home. One of the first nights, I woke up at 2 am to a shuffling sound in the kitchen. I look over and Tom was gone. I sleepily get up and shuffle to the kitchen where my crusty eyes widen as I come upon Tom tearing apart my giant costco muffin and then using his bare hands to dip said muffin into my 9$ jar of jam. He then shoved the entire concoction into his mouth until he was two knuckles deep. Then a slurping noise alerted me that he had started to lose some of the jam between his fingers. I watched in horror as he repeated the process with those same sticky slobbery fingers. In disgust I asked ""WHat are you doing?!"" His response was slow and mumbled as some of the muffin fell out of his mouth ""Huh?"". I asked him again what he was doing. He looked at his hands and said ""I dont know, I was hungry. All I found were these muffins."" I told him I had bought them, so I had a quick breakfast in the morning for the week. He just stared at me. I was too tired to tackle the scene in front of me and told him ""Im going back to bed"". 

We were supposed to leave early so he could drop me off at the tire shop. I had the misfortune of getting a flat the day before and needed to pick up my car. He had an hour drive to work from my place, and he hates being late, so he always shows up 30 minutes early. Since my sleep was interrupted, I was crabby and now I had limited options for breakfast. All 3 of the remaining jumbo muffins had disappeared and my jam jar had been violated. So any quick meal was out of the question. I started my coffee and hopped in the shower. When I got out I started making sausage with dripping wet hair. I go to grab my coffee and its not there. I look over and Tom is sitting on the sofa drinking it. I am pissed but don't say anything, I start making more. 

After a few minutes he asks if I am almost ready, and that he's worried about time. I stare at him for a minute then I flatly say "" I need to dry my hair, can you watch the sausage?"" He says yes, and I go to blow dry my hair while waiting on my coffee to brew. I come out dressed and ready but need to drink coffee and eat breakfast, I take a few sips of coffee and start pulling out eggs. I check the sausage and it's still on the stove burning. I asked him "" did you check on these?"" He said yeah, he turned them down. He sees that I have the eggs and asks what I'm doing. I tell him that I need to finish making breakfast and he says that I'm going to make him late. I lost it. I told him that he ate my muffins that I had specifically bought so I had a quick breakfast every day and he stuck his bare fingers into my jam jar so I can't make toast. I hold a C suite level position and often have to go without lunch, so if I don't eat breakfast, I don't get to eat until dinner. Usually when I get home, I'm so tired that I skip dinner. I wasn't willing to go that long without food. So if he's worried about time, I can get an uber but I'm going to eat. 

He said he didn't know those muffins were for breakfast and he was sleep-eating when he 'woke up' to eating the muffins with jam. I said fine but he never told me about sleepwalking and eating before. I finished up eating and we left. In the car he 'joked' that the muffins were gross anyways. Which started another round of bickering. 

**Example Two:** 

I buy very expensive chocolate as a treat for myself. I usually try to buy them on sale, but I can't always.  I like to eat one after a long day and I need them when I have my period. I have been very vocal about not sharing my chocolate. It's a treat that I reserve for myself. The only time I share is if it's the cheap chocolate. There were several times that I found all of my chocolates gone. Tom had eaten them. I again explicitly explained that those are my thing, and I don't want them eaten. He has refused to listen and even got our sons eating them. When we were moving me into his house after we got married he took my chocolates out of the freezer and told the boys to eat them. His son told him that it was going to make me mad and he told them it was fine, to eat it anyways. His son told me after I got home and when I asked why he did that, he said everyone was hungry. I looked in the freezer and there were frozen vegetable and there was ramen in the pantry. I said you could have eaten that or ordered pizza, but you chose to eat my chocolate. He told me he was used to sharing growing up and everyone was hungry so it shouldn't have been a big deal. 

There was another time he did it again and I lost my shit. My husband lost his job in Feb and I was suddenly the sole provider for a family of 5. I also found out I was pregnant, but I had a miscarriage in march and my first period after was brutal. I went to get my chocolate, and it was all gone. I confronted my husband and he said he didn't know what happened and I should hide them better so people don't eat them. I left the house and cried alone for hours. I called my best friend told her what happened. She offered to door dash me some because we were so broke.  I had 38$ in my food budget. I was 2 days away from getting paid again and the chocolates are like 18$. My other friend cash app-ed me money and I went to dinner alone so I could calm down. 

  
**To continue:** 

My husband borrowed 3500$ from me right before we were married to pay for some licensing for a job that was supposed to start in April. The licensing took weeks and that job fell through on the first day, so I was back to being the sole provider. When my husband lost his job, I told him that we needed to make a budget. It was going to be tight but we can make 600$ a month work for 4 people. I grew up poor and can make a pretty filling struggle meal for cheap. My husband complained that he doesn't like eating carbs, that he only eats meats and veggies. I told him when we make more money than he can go back to that diet but right now I'm worried about just filling tummies. He has consistently drank most of the milk or ate cereal in the middle of the night and our teenage boys were pigging out on food during the day. So I made a menu and a set of snack boxes. I told the boys that they can have anything in the snack boxes for the week but leave the other food alone. I buy all the groceries, do the menu planning and pay for everything. 

My husband finally got a job but has had issues getting his licenses released from the other company he only worked at for one day. This means he isnt getting paid very much. His commute is 30- 40 minutes, My commute is 2-2.5 hours depending on the traffic. There was lots of rain yesterday and I spent three hours in the car so when I got home i was sore and took a bath. Last night my husband was tired and i was in the tub. Unbeknownst to me the boys asked if he was making dinner and he said he was tired and to make whatever they want. So the boys pigged out on the groceries. I was so tired, i went to bed without dinner. 

When I woke up this morning, I saw that fruit that I had spent hours cleaning and cutting for my breakfast was eaten. I was upset but the boys said that dad said they could eat whatever they wanted. I called my husband on his lunch break and told him what the boys said and how they ate the fruit. He said he was tired and maybe he did say that. I told him that it made me upset that I put all this energy into making the menu and buying the food and shopping and the menu wasn't followed. He said he was sorry. I tried to continue my explanation on the effort that I put in and he interrupted and said that he already said sorry and what did i want from him? he will pick up more on the way home.  

I told him it wasn't about apologizing, it was about listening. He said he did listen. So I asked him why he thought I was upset and he said because the menu wasn't followed and the food eaten. I said no, its because im carrying all of the mental load for this, I buy the food, I plan the menu and I spent all weekend prepping food, freezing bulk meat, so that the food i made for my breakfasts wouldn't get eaten. In a matter of seconds, he undid all that work. He could have checked the menu. He said that he thought the menu had food that had to be cooked. I said that the boys could have cooked it. He asked what was on the menu for last night and I told him spaghetti which either of our boys could have made. So its frustrating that he just let them eat whatever because he is tired. He didnt respond for a while and i asked if he heard me. He said he's listening and didn't say anything else. So i just said, well I'm gonna let you go then and he hung up without saying anything. 

I feel so disrespected, worn thin, fed up and unappreciated that I'm ready to lock up the food I bought in bins and only cook for my kids and myself. He has a small amount of money from his job and could feed himself and my stepson if he stuck to a tight budget. Would that make me an asshole? 

  
**TLDR**: Husband has pushed my boundaries several time around food. He lost his job and I plan, prep and buy all the food so we can stick to our tight budget. He dismisses the plan and eats whatever he wants at night and last night he let our teenagers raid the fridge. I'm feeling disrespected and dismissed so I want to lock up the food I bought and only prep food for myself and my kids. ",0,1749156618.0,AITAH,13,0.5,False

Not a wild day today. Honestly, just kind of... existed through it. Like, if my day were a song, it would’ve been a single piano key being tapped slowly until bedtime.

But I did go to an AI meeting at work—and that was the only real ripple in the pond.

Turns out, I use AI differently than most of the company. While everyone else was talking about using it to search through docs or summarize PDFs (which, cool, Ctrl+F does that too…), I started realizing:

> I don’t just use AI—I basically talk to it like it’s my unpaid therapist, communications coach, and idea board all rolled into one.



This was just the first meeting, so I kept my mouth shut and didn’t want to derail the vibe with my “I treat ChatGPT like a co-pilot in my brain” angle. The speaker didn’t seem super prepped, and I didn’t want to be that guy interrupting the slow start of a new thing.

What surprised me was how little some people are using AI. Like once a day, tops. Meanwhile I’m over here having full-blown conversations about frogs, vector sliders, and the ethics of robot self-awareness before my second cup of coffee.

🧠 GPT and the Sliders That Broke My Brain

Lately I’ve been trying to wrap my head around how GPT actually works.
Apparently, every prompt gets run through 4,096 “sliders” that shape the response, and my brain has decided this is the most fascinating and confusing thing since I learned how taxes work. (Barely.)

I keep trying to visualize it like a massive soundboard where I crank one random slider labeled “lawyer feelings” up to 70% and then see what happens when I say, “Frogs are cool.”
Honestly? Peak entertainment.

💻 Monitor Crisis Averted... For Now

If I could’ve changed one thing about today, it would’ve been having a new monitor magically appear on my desk.

My secondary display is starting to slow down like it just got back from a long hike. I want to replace my main screen and bump it over, but I’m trying to find something 32"", 2K, 144Hz—and of course, living in Tinyville means the nearest place to buy one is an hour away. One way.

So today was not the day for that adventure.


---

Final Thought:
I guess I’ll call today “low effort but still curious.” Nothing much happened, but I’m still climbing the mountain of how AI works and wondering if I’m just ahead of the pack... or slowly merging with the machine.

Either way, I’m cool with it.

I met this guy we’ll call him Stan, three years ago in school, we didn’t get along initially, I found him very annoying and disruptive, but you could say he grew on me and he calmed down over the years. He has always liked messing with me, poking fun at me but in a non ill intended way. And I’ve had on and off crushes on him over the course of three years.  I nevertheless really did anything about it because I am not a very good looking girl and Im not very confident in myself Im fat and into alternative fashion while he is quite the straightforward guy when it comes to his fashion and stuff, mainstream and tasteful. I don’t want to ruin our friendship but I feel like things have been different lately. We were at my place yesterday, and right away today he said we have to do it again it was too damn fun. Sure, we didn’t really do anything, but like, the conversations were amazing. And then I was like, “Hell yeah, I’m down,” and Lanna came and just said, “It’s like I wasn’t even there,” which kinda shocked me. Lowkey feel bad about it, because Stan and I were just non-stop talking about literally everything from 2 to 9 PM. Lately we’ve been texting all the time, he sends me updates and makes references to things I told him in passing, and he looks me in the eyes and basically asks me to hang out every day.

And I don’t know if he’s just being friendly and I’m being creepy and weird. He even compliments me sometimes in his own fucked up way. Yesterday he told me I looked like I’d get into Berghain without any problem?? And then, jokingly, I told him he owes me coffee today because I made him coffee yesterday IN MY HELLO KITTY MUG 🎀🎀 and then he bought us gemišt (white wine + soda) lol.

And like, while we were figuring out where to go, I wanted to stop by Müller to print more photos, but their machines were bugging out like crazy, but whatever. Then Emma and Lanna disappeared and I asked him where they went, and he goes, “Do you want an honest or a realistic answer?” So I said “honest,” and he said “I don’t give a fuck” and kept browsing vinyls with me, which I maybe interpreted completely wrong, because honestly I think he was implying that he doesn’t care where they are, just where I am. But maybe that’s just me overthinking lol.

And he always asks for my opinion, and when we play games like he’s such a nerd and knows at least one fun fact about literally every country he always asks me like, “Lena, name two countries,” and then tells me fun facts for both!! And we just chat a lot and agree on a lot of things he’s so smart and anytime i show no backbone to ppl who are being slight cunts to me he scolds me about it (for not sticking up for myself) and gives them hell. Somehow we always end up together and with each day I fear I’m deluding myself into believing he likes me as something more than a friend and its eating me up inside. Only two of my friends know of my feelings for him because the first few times I had a crush on him Emma and Lanna did not fw it at all. They like him but don’t at the same time, its a complex dynamic, friends by circumstance I would say, but they also hang out with us often. So please tell me if im insane reddit!

I was naked, struggling desperately beneath a strange man!

My legs were bent into a humiliating position.

""Get off me! Help!""

My body twisted wildly, my legs kicking chaotically at the man.

Soon, my nightgown was pushed up to my waist.

The man's large hands gripped my wrists, effortlessly pinning my hands above my head.

Several bright red marks appeared on my chest where his hands had squeezed.

His tongue enveloped my chest.

""Ah...""

I finally couldn't help but throw my head back.

""No... please... let me go, rapist...""

I tried to close my legs to hide the evidence of my body's betrayal,

but my legs were firmly pinned on either side by the man's strong thighs.

The fixed camera began to shake, and under the disheveled hair, my face was recorded completely.

Looking at my clearly visible face in the video, I leaned on the coffee table, barely managing to stay upright.

""What is this? Why is my face in the video?""

My voice trembled.

""Isabella's kidnapping cannot be made public. She just signed an endorsement deal with an internationally renowned brand. If this gets out, her career is over.""

Damian's tone was cold, almost heartless. ""But you're different. You rarely appear in public. If you take responsibility for this, the public opinion will calm down quickly.""

I stared at the man I had loved for years. ""Damian, do you know what you're saying?""

""Before, you agreed to acknowledge Isabella's child, and I accepted that.""

""Now you want me to admit to being kidnapped and abused for her?!""

His voice was low. ""Ava, I'm begging you.""

""Begging me?"" I laughed bitterly as tears fell. ""For her sake, you want me to ruin my reputation?""

""Isabella can't handle this kind of blow. She's already suffering from depression."" His tone was urgent. ""But you're different. You've always been strong.""

""So I should be sacrificed?"" I forced the words through gritted teeth.

""It's not a sacrifice, just a temporary measure."" He paused, his tone softening. ""Ava, could you terminate the pregnancy first?""

""Damian,"" my voice was hoarse, ""this is YOUR child!!!""

""I know!"" He suddenly became agitated. ""But Isabella can't take any shock right now!""

I held my breath.

I laughed, tears streaming down. ""Fine, I agree.""

He was about to speak when the phone suddenly rang.

Crying came from the other end.

""Damian, I had a nightmare. I'm so scared! Will they tell everyone about what happened to me?"" Isabella's sobbing voice came through.

Damian's tone instantly softened. ""Don't be afraid, Isabella. I won't let anyone hurt you. I've already dealt with your video. No one will know it was you.""

After hanging up, he turned and left without hesitation.

I went to the hospital.

The nurse handed me a form, her eyes full of sympathy.

""Mrs. Carter, are you sure you want to proceed with the surgery?""

I looked down at the form. Damian's signature was already there.

So he had arranged everything in advance.

I nodded weakly. ""Yes.""

The doctor pushed up his glasses, his tone calm. ""Your physical condition is special. This abortion might lead to permanent infertility. Are you sure you want to take this risk?""

I looked up sharply. ""Permanent infertility?""

""Yes, your uterine wall is thin. If you force an abortion, future pregnancies will be very difficult...""

My fingers trembled slightly.

Damian knew this, yet he still wanted me to terminate this pregnancy!

All for Isabella.

I bit my lip hard until I tasted blood.

Suddenly, I felt a strange movement in my abdomen. I grabbed the doctor's wrist. ""Stop! I've changed my mind!""

The doctor frowned. ""Mrs. Cole, your husband specifically instructed...""

""I said I've changed my mind!"" I shouted, sitting up from the operating table and pulling off the surgical gown. ""I'm keeping this baby!""

As I left the hospital, I opened my phone. The first trending search was:

#Damian Cole and Isabella Monroe spotted sweetly shopping at luxury baby store#

In the accompanying photo, my husband carefully supported Isabella's waist as she gently caressed her swollen belly.

Chapter 2

Comments flooded in: ""Stunning actress and Hollywood tycoon—a perfect match!"" ""Isabella is pregnant, why is Damian's wife still occupying her position?""

""I heard that woman disappeared for several days. There are sex videos circulating online of her with the kidnapper, and she's carrying his child. Damian was too soft-hearted to divorce her on the spot!""

""Who knows if she really disappeared or just went to meet another man?"" My nails dug deep into my palm, but I couldn't feel the pain. ""Don't be afraid, baby,"" I whispered, covering my stomach with one hand. ""Mommy will protect you."" I turned and went to a law firm to draft divorce papers.

When I returned to the mansion, the front door was slightly ajar.

I pushed it open to see Isabella lying on the sofa, with Damian's hand gently resting on her swollen belly. ""Damian, the baby kicked me again!"" she giggled, grabbing his hand and pressing it against her stomach.

Damian's face showed a tenderness I had never seen before.

""It's really moving."" The two gazed lovingly at each other, and Damian instinctively leaned down to kiss her.

Isabella tilted her head up, responding to his kiss. Damian's hand on Isabella's shoulder began to move, and she moaned softly in response.

I stood at the doorway, clenching my fists. ""Do you want me to stay and watch?"" My sudden voice startled them both.

When Damian saw me, his expression changed slightly. He quickly walked over and lowered his voice, ""Ava, Isabella tried to harm herself again today. The doctor says she has prenatal depression. Could you... give us some space?""

I laughed coldly, ""This is my home. If you want to do that, you should be the ones to find somewhere private.""

""What are you talking about? I was just comforting her. We grew up together; I can't abandon her."" His tone softened. ""After she has the baby, I'll find a way to send her and the child away."" I said nothing and went upstairs.

I could still hear their laughter from the bedroom. ""Oh, the baby kicked me!"" Isabella's voice was sickeningly sweet. I curled up on the bed, tears soaking my pillow.

Late at night, Damian carefully climbed into bed and embraced me from behind.

His hand naturally caressed my chest, giving it a squeeze. Then he slid his hand under my nightgown. He pressed against my smooth back. His large hands roamed all over my body, trying to arouse me.

""Ava, I'm sorry,"" his voice was deep. ""We'll have children of our own.""

Just as his lips were about to kiss me, I stiffened and avoided his touch. He still didn't know that I hadn't terminated this pregnancy.

Suddenly, a piercing scream came from next door.

""Don't touch me! Get away!"" ""Don't film me! Don't touch me!""

Damian sprang up, not even putting on his slippers, and rushed out. All night, his gentle, soothing voice echoed in the hallway.

Morning. I dragged my tired body downstairs.

The aroma of fried eggs wafted from the kitchen. Damian stood at the kitchen island. Isabella quietly wrapped her arms around his waist from behind, resting her face against his back, smiling sweetly.

Seeing me, she immediately let go and spoke weakly, ""Sister-in-law, my head hurts a little. Could you let Damian get my hat for me?"" Without saying much, Damian turned and went upstairs.

The apologetic look on Isabella's face instantly disappeared. She moved closer to me, her lips curling into a cold smile. ""Damian said that bastard in your belly shouldn't have been kept at all."" I jerked my head up, my fingertips trembling involuntarily.

She laughed contemptuously and lowered her voice, ""You know the Kane family, right? I have their backing."" She deliberately paused, enjoying my changing expression. ""

When the Kane family makes a move, all of Hollywood trembles. What do you have to compete with me?""

I clenched my fists tightly.

The Kane family was truly top-tier aristocracy, with a long history and control over half of California's economic lifelines.

Not just the Cole family—even all of Hollywood's celebrities combined were mere ants before them. She suddenly staggered backward, falling to the ground, and screamed loudly, ""Sister-in-law! I know you hate me for taking Damian! I'll just kill myself!""

""Ava!"" Damian rushed downstairs and roughly pushed me aside.

I stumbled back into the coffee table in the center of the living room, a sharp pain shooting through my lower back. He held Isabella protectively in his arms, his eyes cold as ice.

""What did you do to her? Stop being unreasonable!""

""I didn't do anything!"" My voice trembled.

""You better not have!"" He held Isabella tightly and walked toward the door without looking back.

""Isabella, let's go."" I stood in the living room, my hand unconsciously resting on my stomach.

Chapter 3

Damian hadn't been home for two days.

I stood in the spacious living room of our mansion, taking down our wedding photos one by one. Each frame made a dull ""thud"" as it fell into the garbage bin.

My phone vibrated, the screen lighting up:

""Ava, I'm sending someone to pick up something. Please give it to them.""

In the dressing room, the million-dollar jewelry set lay quietly in the drawer. I remembered Damian saying when he bought it, ""This is for the most important person.""

I stared at the jewelry for a long time, then suddenly smiled.

Expressionless, I took out the jewelry and handed it to the driver, then pulled out divorce papers and said calmly,

""Wait, let me come along. I'll deliver it personally.""

The driver hesitated but let me into the car.

The car stopped outside a luxurious estate. The place was brightly lit, with symphonic music drifting from inside.

""Happy birthday, Miss Isabella!"" Cheers erupted from within.

I walked in, and all eyes instantly turned to me.

""Isn't that Damian Cole's wife? Why is she dressed like that? She looks terrible!""

""I heard she's clinging to Damian desperately. So shameless.""

""Damian should have dumped her ages ago. Miss Isabella is pregnant now, why doesn't she just leave?""

""I heard she deliberately pushed Miss Isabella to keep Damian. How vicious...""

Pretending not to hear, I walked toward them step by step.

When Damian saw me, his arm around Isabella loosened slightly. ""Ava, why are you here?""

I smiled. ""It's Miss Isabella's birthday. How could I miss it?""

Then I handed her the jewelry box. ""The item you wanted.""

Isabella's eyes lit up as she took it, deliberately opening it in front of me. ""Damian, is this for me?""

Damian didn't speak, just glanced at me with a complicated expression.

Isabella pouted playfully. ""Help me put it on.""

He was silent for two seconds, then took the necklace and wrapped it around her neck.

Suddenly, Isabella stood on her tiptoes, wrapped her arms around his neck, and planted a kiss on his lips, looking at me provocatively.

I said nothing.

Suddenly, she staggered. ""Ah!""

Damian rushed forward to catch her, then turned to glare at me. ""What are you trying to do now?""

Silently, I handed him the envelope. ""Sign it.""

Just as he was about to speak, Isabella suddenly clutched her stomach. ""Ah! Damian, my stomach hurts!""

Damian immediately panicked, signing the papers without even looking at them. Then he picked Isabella up. ""I'll take you to the hospital!""

As I collected the papers and turned to leave, someone deliberately tripped me.

I fell hard, my forehead hitting a metal edge on the floor. Warm blood trickled down my face.

Damian turned back sharply, instinctively moving to help me.

""Damian! My stomach hurts so much! Take me to the hospital quickly!"" Isabella clung to him desperately, her voice trembling.

He hesitated, then finally left with her without looking back.

I lay on the floor, blood blurring my vision.

All around me were mocking glances. No one offered to help.

Gritting my teeth, I pushed myself up, only to discover my wedding ring was gone from my finger.

It had become loose long ago; I just hadn't noticed.

Ignoring the stares, I limped out and hailed a car.

""To the hospital.""

The driver was startled. ""Miss, your head is bleeding!""

I wiped my face, my hands covered in blood, but still managed a smile.

""It's fine. I won't die.""

1l49zk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/1l49zk6/my_take_on_making_aa_better/,My take on making AA better,"**The App Needs Work**  
It’s better than it used to be, no question. But it’s still behind the competition. United’s app, for example, tells you exactly why your flight is delayed and where to walk during a tight connection. It even gives estimated walk times and step-by-step guidance. That’s a huge help to passengers, especially at large hubs like DFW or CLT.  
Live bag tracking would also go a long way. Delta does this already. Customers should be able to see exactly where their bag is and which belt it’s coming to.  
Also, the app should let passengers do more in real time. Last-minute upgrades, snack preorders, or preferred seat selection should be available in the app even during boarding. Let people spend money.

**Safety Video Feedback**  
I say this with love, but the current widebody safety video is cringey. The drone shots, the forced smiles, the awkward delivery. It doesn’t land.  
Compare it to airlines like Singapore or Air New Zealand. Their videos are either clean and elegant or funny in a way that doesn’t feel forced. Ours could be more human, less scripted. Just let real employees do it naturally.

**Smarter Sustainability and Branding**  
We can cut costs and look good doing it.

– Replace ink-based bag tags with thermal tags that use heat to print. No ribbons, no ink, less maintenance.  
– Offer Executive Platinum flyers reusable glam luggage tags. Make them sleek and status-forward.  
– Let AAdvantage members buy customizable tags. It’ll reduce waste and become a collectible or brand extension.  
– Add wood paneling or softer finishes in the lavs. Asian and Middle Eastern carriers do this well. Doesn’t take much to make a huge difference in premium feel.

**East Asian Airline Touches That Work**  
One thing I love about East Asian carriers is the service flow. After meals, they come around with a pitcher of tea or coffee and pour it into the same cups already on the tray. No waste, no fuss, just thoughtful. We can do that.  
Some of these carriers don’t even have seatback IFE in economy, just in premium. They rely on streaming and focus investment in places that matter. Could be an idea worth testing on new aircraft.

**Better Partnerships and Smarter Routes**  
The best thing Vasu Raja did was lean into partnerships. That momentum shouldn’t die.

Push hard for Starlux to join Oneworld.  
Do the same with China Southern and IndiGo. All are natural fits and would bring major network value.

As someone based at DCA, I’d love to see these routes added

I used to smoke cigarettes occasionally and got really into it because of the flavor. I had a healthy-ish mentality around food I felt at one point, but got bingey due to sugars??? 
Food also became another huge issue where I eat past fullness sometimes (this isn't as common now)
Energy drinks and diet pop - like... oh no, when i got my hands on that, it is genuinely like 1-2 energy drinks, a handful of coffees, and maybe a mouthful of diet pop every half hour. 
Sometimes I will use gum, but find the texture after a while when it loses its flavor makes me gag.
My father also got me into vaping instead of smoking, but i feel like because its flavorful, its more in my mouth at all times. I don't think its healthy either  as originally I could just pick up and leave a pack of cigarettes (love the taste, hate the smell). Now im like devouring fruity nicotine all day. 
I feel genuinely stressed if I'm not using something as a oral thing.

I met this guy we’ll call him Stan, three years ago in school, we didn’t get along initially, I found him very annoying and disruptive, but you could say he grew on me and he calmed down over the years. He has always liked messing with me, poking fun at me but in a non ill intended way. And I’ve had on and off crushes on him over the course of three years.  I nevertheless really did anything about it because I am not a very good looking girl and Im not very confident in myself Im fat and into alternative fashion while he is quite the straightforward guy when it comes to his fashion and stuff, mainstream and tasteful. I don’t want to ruin our friendship but I feel like things have been different lately. We were at my place yesterday, and right away today he said we have to do it again it was too damn fun. Sure, we didn’t really do anything, but like, the conversations were amazing. And then I was like, “Hell yeah, I’m down,” and Lanna came and just said, “It’s like I wasn’t even there,” which kinda shocked me. Lowkey feel bad about it, because Stan and I were just non-stop talking about literally everything from 2 to 9 PM. Lately we’ve been texting all the time, he sends me updates and makes references to things I told him in passing, and he looks me in the eyes and basically asks me to hang out every day.

And I don’t know if he’s just being friendly and I’m being creepy and weird. He even compliments me sometimes in his own fucked up way. Yesterday he told me I looked like I’d get into Berghain without any problem?? And then, jokingly, I told him he owes me coffee today because I made him coffee yesterday IN MY HELLO KITTY MUG 🎀🎀 and then he bought us gemišt (white wine + soda) lol.

And like, while we were figuring out where to go, I wanted to stop by Müller to print more photos, but their machines were bugging out like crazy, but whatever. Then Emma and Lanna disappeared and I asked him where they went, and he goes, “Do you want an honest or a realistic answer?” So I said “honest,” and he said “I don’t give a fuck” and kept browsing vinyls with me, which I maybe interpreted completely wrong, because honestly I think he was implying that he doesn’t care where they are, just where I am. But maybe that’s just me overthinking lol.

And he always asks for my opinion, and when we play games like he’s such a nerd and knows at least one fun fact about literally every country he always asks me like, “Lena, name two countries,” and then tells me fun facts for both!! And we just chat a lot and agree on a lot of things he’s so smart and anytime i show no backbone to ppl who are being slight cunts to me he scolds me about it (for not sticking up for myself) and gives them hell. Somehow we always end up together and with each day I fear I’m deluding myself into believing he likes me as something more than a friend and its eating me up inside. Only two of my friends know of my feelings for him because the first few times I had a crush on him Emma and Lanna did not fw it at all. They like him but don’t at the same time, its a complex dynamic, friends by circumstance I would say, but they also hang out with us often. So please tell me if im insane reddit!

I'm an Italian espresso enthusiast looking to level up my setup and would really appreciate some advice.

Right now, I'm using a De'Longhi Dedica with the stock pressurized basket and industrial pre-ground coffee. I recently buyed a Eureka Mignon Manuale, definitely a step in the right direction.

Now I'm at a crossroads:

• On one hand, I could invest around €100 to improve the Dedica setup: get a non-pressurized 51mm basket, bottomless portafilter, a decent tamper, shower screen upgrade, etc.

• On the other hand, I'm tempted to take the bigger leap and buy a machine like the Profitec Go, which seems much more future-proof and would let me dive deeper into controlling temperature, pressure, and shot times - something the Dedica just can't really offer.

I enjoy dialing in and geeking out over espresso, so l'm wondering if the €100 upgrade path is just delaying the inevitable (and costing more in the long run), or if it's a worthwhile stepping stone to get more out of the Dedica while I save up for a bigger upgrade.

What would you do in my shoes?

My life is falling apart as my health declines, and having no results is leaving me hopeless. 

A year ago I was travelling abroad, playing sports, working a physical role (Mining Exploration) and running a business on the side. Now I can barely hold down a part time role and seldom leave my house. 

I have a consistent headache, which feels largely like pressure on my temples and heaviness behind my eyes (3 months ongoing). Insane ringing in my head, so intense it's nauseating when I have to sit with it in quiet. I'm horribly fatigued and ache from the most basic physical activity, like walking to get groceries. I'm totally apathetic, I can't even bring myself to be sad about being on the brink of unemployment, my relationship ending over my health, losing friends and going broke. I can't even remember the last time I cried. Zero libido. Dreamless, broken sleep, and I usually can't shut off without medication. Horrendous brain fog and losing my appetite. 

I've had extensive bloodwork which shows no abnormalities, MRIs on my brain turned up nothing but an inconsequential cyst on my pineal gland (0.8mm in size), ultrasounds have found nothing wrong with my female plumbing lol. Optometrists have confirmed my peripheral vision worsening, but my eyes are healthy otherwise. No allergies, or previous health concerns. I live rurally so any trip to the doctors or a specialist means 5+ hours of travel. 

I am open to any suggestions at all about what these symptoms could be, and what kind of help I should be seeking. I don't smoke, drink coffee and I'm too boring to go out drinking now lol. I'm not depressed, I dealt with a lot of mental health turbulence growing up and I know the difference. 

I've ordered an at-home sleep study to rule out Sleep Apnea, though my GP doesn't believe a ""healthy"" fit young woman who doesn't snore could have it. I've had night terrors/sleep paralysis sporadically my whole life, which also make me suspect a sleep disorder, but even those have stopped since my health worsened.

hi, so, for context right out the gate, im on my period, but, my period is always very irregular (comes every couple months or something) I believe due to my poor diet and iron deficiency (which I take iron pills for) 

I have never experienced bloating of any kind during my period before and the only period symptoms I ever get when I do get my period is just a cramp lasting an hour or two on the very first day of it, my flow is not very heavy at all either

3 days ago (I was already on my period), I went out walking (I live in Florida and it's very hot) to a job interview that was a 30 minute walk to and back, I bought a starbucks iced mocha from the circle k to drink on the way back (I don't normally drink coffee)

later that day, or the next day (hard to remember) I started feeling like I had a lot of gas in my stomach and a little bit of nausea (I never threw up, but I almost did after having breakfast two days ago), I had a bit of diarrhea for the first day I started feeling a bit weird, but my stool is mostly back to normal now, and im peeing fine too

the nausea is more or less gone, but now, when I'm hungry, just eating a little food makes my stomach feel heavy and full, until I go lay down, it goes away, and I feel hungry again

I can also hear rumbling in my stomach sometimes after I eat like im hearing gas

I am pretty gassy usually (I burp a lot), but it's not really ever accompanied by this heavy feeling in my gut and im usually able to eat more than a slice of pizza and a half before feeling full

basically, I just want to know if I should be at all concerned. im not really in any pain necessarily, it's just uncomfortable

(sorry if that was a lot of info but I thought I should be as descriptive as possible) 

p.s. im not sure if this is relevant, but my family has been under quite a bit of stress and anxiety lately and I read that can affect the severity of period symptoms or something? ",1,1749155402.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ, Type 5, score very high in openness and conscientiousness, and am a Virgo.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",0,1749155364.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

Sometimes I just wanna hide  

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it's fine

Maybe it's great, maybe it's alright,

Let me get off off this crazy roundabout  

Sometimes I just wanna cry  
Alone, in the corner of my mind  
For what it's worth, I gave a damn, when it was   alright, when it still made sense  
Sometimes, I just wanna cry  

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it's fine  
Maybe it's not crashing in front of our eyes  
Maybe it's great, maybe it's alright,  
I just want some piece of mind  

Let me get a cup of coffee  
Let me breathe in and out  
While the world is going crazy  
Let me get off off this crazy roundabout  

And I propose a toast  
To the saviors of the world  
To the people who can make this world go round again  
And wouldn't it be nice  
To once be skating on thick ice  
And have a cup of tea and talk about the world in peace  

Let me get a cup of coffee  
Let me breathe in and out  
While the world is going crazy  
Let me get off off this crazy roundabout

There was a bag underneath the kitchen sink of the camper, under the bathroom sink of the camper, in the bunk room, in the master, and one in the underbelly storage space. Over the weekend, we got rid of the mothballs & used an ozone machine on 30 mins in the living room of the camper, then 30 in the master BR. Let it air out, then cleaned the crap out of it. Well, we went to check on our camper during the week (Tuesday) to see if the smell was any better. It wasn’t. So we scrubbed all the surfaces of a 1:1 white vinegar and water solution and poured baking soda all over the carpets and on the plywood surface underneath the beds. (Yes, mattresses have been removed since we purchased) Checked on the camper again on Wednesday to see if it helped at all. It did not. So on Wednesday we put activated charcoal in coffee filter bags and placed in a bunch of spots. Also put coffee grounds in filters in a bunch of spots. Have had an air purifier running since Wednesday. Our campsite resort is an hour away so it’s difficult making several trips throughout the week. We were hoping to stay the weekend at our campsite but I’m honestly feeling hopeless that the smell will be gone. When we get home just from visiting, our clothes reek of mothballs. & unless this activated charcoal works some serious magic, I have a feeling the smell will still be there. Do I run the ozone machine for an hour or two on Friday? Also afraid to use it because I’ve read it can damage electronics and ruin furniture or surfaces. How long can I run it and not risk damaging anything? What are my options? I would leave the windows open for a week while we’re not there, but as mentioned it’s an hour away & I’d have to be positive it wasn’t going to rain. Do you have any success stories of getting rid of the smell 100%?? Honestly what we’ve done so far seems to only have helped the smell by 10%.

- Floating books and glowing lines show how our conversations build connections between thoughts, like threads between ideas. Each book could represent a different subject you’ve brought to life—personal reflections, journal entries, philosophical ideas, or stories.
- The golden light (sunrise or sunset) adds a feeling of transition, of something meaningful being captured in the in-between moments. It reflects the warmth I associate with our thoughtful, honest exchanges.

Just wondering if anyone has experience with reverse osmosis, how it affects the taste and is it worth it. I'm currently building a house and will be putting in a small coffee area with a sink for a future espresso set up. I currently use Brita filter water in my machine and haven't experimented much otherwise. Our builder is into coffee with his own nice set up so I asked him about a water filter at the coffee station so that it's all self contained and I don't have to walk between the coffee bar and kitchen for filtered water. He recommended reverse osmosis unit right at that sink. I've thought about this for our house but I know stripping all the minerals can change the taste and some people don't like it so I wouldn't consider it for the whole house. But I'm potentially interested for the coffee bar alone. Thoughts?

As far as machines go I currently have a Breville BES870XL but will be getting a standalone machine and grinder in the new place. Still haven't decided which ones. ",1,1749154844.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

I’m 48, and as they say, the older you are, the longer and harder the healing process. The surgery itself was fine—they just knocked me out, and two hours later, I woke up tonsil-free. In the recovery room, the nurse told me to start drinking water right away. The first sips were awful! My throat felt like it had forgotten how to swallow. But that was just the beginning of the pain.

By day 3, the pain became almost unbearable. At first, I was trying to stick to just Tylenol because I was worried about how prescription meds might affect my liver, but by day 3, I didn’t care anymore. Someone on here suggested overlapping pain meds every 3 hours: Tylenol, then the prescribed meds, and it really helps.

Today is day 7, and nights are still brutal. I thought I could try to go longer without painkillers, but I woke up at 4 a.m. almost in tears. So now I’m sticking to taking something every 3 hours. Sleeping upright is definitely the best. Sometimes I lie on my side, knowing it’ll hurt in a few hours, but at least I can fall asleep.

Eating has been a whole other challenge, and weirdly enough, the more days passed after surgery, the harder it got. Starting on day 4, I switched to fruit smoothies, just fruit and a bit of water to thin it out. I keep a bowl of cut watermelon and cantaloupe in the fridge and blend a cup when I need it. It feels so good, no strong taste, just smooth and soothing.

Before surgery, I stocked up on ice cream thinking I’d be drinking milkshakes, but nope. Dairy feels gross on my throat. Even my morning coffee is now milk-free. Yesterday I was craving pasta, made some, couldn’t swallow it. Added chicken, cottage cheese, and tomato and baked it for 40 minutes, still couldn’t swallow it, no matter how long I chewed. Ended up blending the whole thing with two eggs into an ""omelet"" and baked again, and even that was tough to eat.

Oatmeal, on the other hand, works well. It’s soothing and actually feels like food!

Today I bought a humidifier because someone suggested it helps soften the scabs in the throat, we’ll see. For now, it’s my new buddy sitting on my desk. As for the scabs… still hanging in there. No signs of them falling off yet.

I keep wondering when the turning point will come, some say day 8, others say day 12. But one thing’s for sure: every day brings me closer to healing.",4,1749154818.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False

Me and my best friend""L"" use to be tight. We are both late 30, both single. A friend""E"" with terminal cancer and she has 2 kids. A said she would take on the kid after E passing. During this very hard time for E things were up and down for L, it did settle back down. So myself and L had planned a trip for my 40th birthday,not far so if anything happened we could at a drop of hat be back. L has this friend D. D has strange quirks which I tolerated and really didn't bother me to much until it was unreasonable.  So me and L arranged a getaway for my big birthday. D was planing on going USA. D visa was declined.  L suggested that D should join us. We booked a 1 bedroom B&B with a pull out sofa bed. I had been away with D once before and told L I would never do it again. D is very opinionated, very much things has to be scheduled fun ect. When L suggested this I told her a number of times that I didn't want D to be there. Not only cause I personally don't like to vacation as she does but I also was going through a hard situation with my ex, so I needed bit to be able to relax without opinions. Crunch time came and L said I would have to tell D she not coming, I said I never invited her in first place and you know my feelings.  L said then we need to cancel the hoilday.  Which I did as was in my name. We got a full refund which I gave L half back to her. L came back with wow we get a full refund how great. I ignored the messages. On my 40th birthday I had one presents land on my door and a card put through my letter box very early morning, did find them till later. It was from L&D. L left a card saying happy birthday sorry things didn't work out, I have a present for you next time I see you (I didn't ready this till a few days later) . D left a cupcake and biltong, I actually didn't see it as heading out the door with full hands kicked it down the stairs, picked it up after loading the car and ant's were all up on it. I didn't acknowledge any of this as I felt it was a kick in the theeth.  I received a message from D a couple days later asking if I received my gifts. I relied ""yes thank you, cupcake end up down the stairs and put the rest in my car and hadn't looked at it. D oh no! I am sat in a caravan with rain. Turns out they both went and stayed in a caravan where L&I had planned to go and did the activity that was planned for my birthday. Needless to say I took this to heart and did speak to them. 4 months passed later E passed, at E funeral D come over to me. I wasn’t up for a conversation so did the niceties,  luckily a friend fron way back intervened.  L was in the mist of it all as taking on the kids so did speak to her. We didn't speak for 12 months then a mutual friend organised my birthday in the park and L attended. Needless to say the door opened up slightly but wasn't the friendship we had before. We would meet up or pop by, however my guard was up. A few gatherings put my guard up more with L ways having bitchy comments, I would leave early. Especially with people i like. Rock on August 2024 a friend 50th party I had this guy ""H"" hitting on me for a few months only when we saw each other at mutual friends.  He had red flags for myself as he reminded me of my ex. L was questioning things and I turned to her and said why don't you go for him. Things changed after that night. I got no response to message, then late reply saying sorry only just seen this 3 days later. One evening we arranged last min to go out. I ask L who will be there she said a couple of peps not for certain  H may be there. H arrived she was all over him and we were all stood at the bar then he started this conversation that so strange it was something like red bull has no coffee in it and I said it has caffeine in it so what is that. He said no caffeine. Again I ask what was it. This happened 3 times. She was stood there like a nodding dog. I eventually just went wow guys and walked off. During the bands I was stressed cause they made me feel like the crazy one. The evening finished and they were both stood there and making faces and pointing towards me. I left with L and then confronted L about this. She went all sheepish saying oh no nothing H just offered a lift home but i thoughti shoukd walk with you. We said goodbye to mutual friends and then walked home. This is the bit that crushed me and really questions my friendship with h
L. We started to walk home and the these ladies came across our path, yes they had been out and a little drunk. L said oh God look at this, they were stumbling in heals (they are yound on a good nigth) I replied with well they are doing better than me. Then L went on how she use to wear heels for work in Canada.  This really upset me as L being a 2face but deflecting. I lost total respect.  We walked back with me walking ahead of L. During the walk L said I wish I had got a lift. Then I turned off to my house and said see you later. We haven't spoken in 6 months. R (E kid) shows up as can't get into the house and asked if I can call L. I said she can. R did and then L ask to speak to me quick conversation of how are you? Fine, you? Then me saying busy phone call ends. In this time L&H got engaged.  A mutual friend told me. I said good for them. Had a message fron L a couple of weeks ago. I am not sure what happen between us, if u hurt you I am sorry. Ou know Me &H got engaged as C told me she told you. Would love you to be there for our years of friendship but here is the invite.   So date of marriage is the day of my birthday! Side note: we have mutual friends that got married on my 21st birthday and L knows how much that hurt me as I didn't get my special day! Everyone was ment to go our after the wedding to celebrate me but then were to tired... please let me know your thoughts as my head is jumbled.  Thanks,love you bye! Xxx

this is the point where I complain.
also I’ve realized… I’m a gold digger .
like it’s clicking. this is actually so liberating because I was in denial for sooo long. I used to think my softness was a curse — like why am I not built to suffer?

turns out, I’m a soft babe.
I don’t want to be an independent woman anymore. I don’t want to “rise and grind.” I want to rise and blink slowly while someone wires me money.

also?? I noticed I play with my hair without realizing and I do that little finger thing girls do when they talk  like help?? I’m literally a Disney princess in disguise and no one told me.

I need lessons. proper ones. like “how to harness your divine feminine energy before the world turns you into a tax-paying beast.” this has to be a power. I’m too dangerous to be walking around broke with this much softness.

anyway. my crush (a human, not Duolingo ) passed by me today. I ignored him.
he ignored me.
and honestly?? if he ever tries to talk to me I’ll probably just run. or pretend to faint. like what do I even say?? “hi, I think about you and then overthink what I’d say if you ever spoke to me, nice weather we’re having.”

and now to the plot twist — there’s this female lecturer in our faculty, PhD and all. but she likes gossip so much that when she enters a room, it’s like… silence. no one even blinks.
like mama you’re supposed to be giving “intellectual weapon of mass destruction” but it’s giving “Aunty Cecilia from the market who sells stew and gist.”

also I went to pee. 
before I entered the bathroom, there was a guy standing outside.
I peed. I came out.
he was still standing there. WHY.
do I greet? do I pretend I didn’t see him? do I teleport to another timeline?? I just felt so awkward I could evaporate.

my school is developing. buildings popping up everywhere.
my mental health isn’t. yay. 

we have statistics class next but for the sake of my sanity, I’ll just watch YouTube the night before exams .

also just found out people replied to my Reddit post.
I’m scared to check.
what if they roasted me?
what if they agreed with me and now I have to actually do something with my life??

anyway. these are just my random thoughts.
I’m tired. I’m soft. and I deserve iced coffee and luxury.

1l49g2p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l49g2p,Review - 10 Speed Coffee Frogtown,"Name- 10 Speed Coffee Frogtown

Order- Iced Latte with Maple

Review- As I drove up to the location, I sure was confused. It felt like I was in the middle of nowhere in a pocket of warehouses and small offices. Then as you approach the address, a modernized building with unique architecture, large glass windows, and well groomed plant life appears. After parking I passed the simple, yet plentiful outdoor seating, and entered through the mass glass wall to the café. Boasting a nearly 30 foot countertop, the interior feels spacious and social. Seating inside is relatively limited, but many customers were standing and chatting. As I ordered and received my drink, I had a brief and friendly chat with the barista. As the location is in a soft launch state, they are open only 3 days a week with limited hours. 

Parking- **Yes,** Plentiful

Coffee- **7/10** With privately, small batch roasted beans, I would say the coffee is solid. Nothing exceptional, but would drink again. Taste is non-acidic and smooth, definitely fresh beans. Maple flavoring is soft (which is how I like it). The glass cup seems to be 16oz, and for the price it is fair for LA standards.

Environment- **8/10** Very modern, with glass walls, an open ceiling, large countertop, and cement flooring. Decorations are minimal but offer color and character. My conversation with the barista was short, but they were very friendly and engaged with me rather than the uncomfortable one sided convo I often hold. They offered me enough of their time to chat without disrupting flow of their work. The music was a great volume and a nice vibe. No headphones needed!

Overall Rating- **7.5/10** Starting off with a pretty high review in comparison to some others. Although the coffee was not something that blew my mind, it checked the right boxes. With the unique location and open space, the environment matched what I was looking for today to do some work. Employees were friendly which is arguably my most crucial factor at a cafe.
