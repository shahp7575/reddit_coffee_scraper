1k1gp1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1k1gp1p/how_does_the_chicco_viaro_travel_system_compare/,How does the Chicco Viaro Travel System compare in safety and convenience?,"The Chicco 04079747680070 Viaro Quick-Fold Travel System has been part of my daily routine for a couple of months now, tackling everything from quick grocery runs to long afternoon strolls in the park. As any parent knows, hunting for the perfect travel system can feel like trying to tame a tornado while juggling flaming balls—chaotic, at best. Naturally, I got my hands on the Viaro with high hopes and cautious optimism.

Lightweight and cleverly designed, this stroller-car seat combo really surprised me from the get-go. Maneuvering through tight aisles at the grocery store and crowded sidewalks is a breeze thanks to its three-wheel setup and agile front swivel wheel. Beyond that, the one-hand quick fold feature is such a lifesaver when you’re holding a wiggly baby in the other arm. Don't underestimate how glorious it feels to collapse a stroller with a single tug when you're sleep-deprived and running late! My sister tried it out when I visited her, and even as a newbie, she folded it effortlessly.  

[Check Chicco 04079747680070 Viaro price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b07g37zjbr)  

**Boons**
- The included KeyFit 30 infant car seat impressed me with its fail-safe installation mechanics. Those two RideRight bubble level indicators and the ReclineSure leveling foot eliminate any guesswork, which feels like a warm hug when you’re paranoid about car seat safety.
- The travel system's aluminum frame is not just lightweight; it’s incredibly sturdy too, which reassures you every time you're out and about.
- A spacious under-seat storage basket, accessible from both the front and back, can hold a diaper bag, snacks, and even an emergency coffee cup.  
- EPS energy-absorbing foam lining the car seat shell adds an extra layer of impact protection. The attention to detail here is top-notch.

Switching focus to comfort, this travel system also caters to older babies. My toddler is a notorious nap-hater, but the Viaro’s multi-position reclining seat somehow works its magic. I didn’t think a stroller’s adjustable canopy and detachable snack tray would feel as necessary as they do, but they’ve become everyday essentials. Even when tackling uneven sidewalks or the occasional gravel path, the rear suspension smooths out the bumps like a charm—it’s no wonder this system has such high ratings.

**Hurdles**
- Although the stroller is lightweight, at 18 pounds, fitting it into smaller trunks doesn’t feel entirely seamless. My friend with a compact car had to reorganize her groceries just to make room.
- While the EVA foam flat-free tires are functional, they don’t exactly scream luxury when used on rougher terrain. A stroller in this price range could likely benefit from air-filled or more durable tires.
- The KeyFit 30 car seat head and body supports are great for newborns, but larger babies outgrow them faster than you’d expect.

**Competing Products**
Looking at other options on the market, I quickly found myself comparing the Chicco Viaro system to Baby Trend’s Expedition Jogger Travel System and the Graco Modes Click Connect Travel System. The Expedition boasts larger bicycle tires and a jogging-friendly design, making it better suited for active parents. However, it sacrifices in terms of weight and ease of portability—it feels much bulkier to cart around. On the other hand, the Graco Modes system offers more versatile seat configurations, but the setup process isn’t as intuitive as the Chicco Viaro. If quick folding with minimal fuss lands high on your priorities, the Viaro is hard to beat. Still, if you primarily jog or want endless seating options, these alternatives might be worth examining.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**
Let’s talk about cost efficiency. While the sticker price might seem on par with other high-end systems, the variety of features you get makes it feel like money well spent. Chicco has bundled an efficient stroller, a safety-focused car seat, and thoughtful extras like cup holders and an adjustable canopy into one package. Would I say you’re getting unmatched value? Maybe not, considering the tires could be improved and compactness in smaller spaces isn’t perfect. That said, it's competitively priced for its target audience—parents juggling convenience and reliable safety.

The Electroliners were two dedicated high speed trainsets that, a long with the Brill 'Bullet' cars, were the ancestors to modern High speed rail. Build by the St Louis Car company for the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railway, it was the Pinnacle of luxury in the era of the great depression. On board, there was a dedicated smoking room, a cafe car where one could purchase coffee and hamburgers, the seats were cushioned, and they were comfortable and fast. They operated on the North Shore line's Skokie Valley route, another ancestor to modern High speed railways as it was built specifically for high speed operations. Sadly, the North Shore line ceased to exist in January 1963, but the Electroliners lived on, seeing service in Philadelphia too. Both trainsets survive, and the one at the Illinois Railway museum is in process of being fully restored to its original condition. The Skokie Valley route is, today, abandoned, with a small section from Howard Street to Dempster Street being utilized by the CTA's yellow line.",1,1744906245.0,lydiavioletofficial,0,1.0,False

1k1gi0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSanctumWonderland/comments/1k1gi0s/chapter_two_sanctum/,Chapter Two — “Sanctum”,"The tank-car cruised through the dead city like a ghost. Glass crunched under its pressureless tires, and the wind outside howled through hollow skyscrapers—but none of it touched them. Inside, there was only quiet, and warmth.

Elias stirred first, as always. He didn’t sleep much. Not anymore.

He moved in silence, barefoot on woven rugs that softened each step. The car’s interior lights bloomed faintly as he passed—soft golds, dim oranges, like the edge of a hearthfire. He tapped the panel above the kitchenette, and a compartment hissed open.

Coffee. Rich, bitter, hot. It brewed itself, as if the car already knew what kind of morning it would be.

He poured two cups—one black, one with sugar—and padded toward the front. Rhea hadn’t opened her eyes, but she reached out as he passed. Her hand curled around the warm ceramic without looking.

“Thanks,” she muttered, still half in sleep.

“Mmm.” Elias sipped his own and watched Jalen, curled against the far wall, his hand twitching in a dream. The boy hadn’t said much the day they let him in. He still didn’t. But sometimes, Elias would find the seats rearranged into a perfect reading nook, or a mug washed and drying on the rack, or the faintest scent of citrus from a rare packet of cleaner no one remembered opening.

Elias leaned against the window, watching the city pass. The windshield was seamless, panoramic—no frame, no wipers, just a slow cascade of hydrophobic shimmer that kept ash and blood from ever sticking.

Outside, the bones of buildings stretched into the clouds. Ash drifts blew between them like snow. And yet, inside: warmth. Quiet jazz—plucked bass, brushed snare—played from somewhere deep in the walls, as natural as a heartbeat.

Rhea finally sat up, brushing her braid back. “You think it’s getting colder out there?”

Jalen opened one eye. “It’s always cold,” he said softly. “We just stopped feeling it.”

Rhea nodded, took another sip, and tucked her feet up onto the seat. “Good thing this thing doesn’t let it in.”

They sat like that for a while. No rush. No noise beyond the music and the hum of systems hidden beneath their feet. The car moved through the ruins steadily—not because it chose the smoothest path, but because its design absorbed every bump and crater like water parting around a stone. Not the fastest. Not the safest. Just steady. And kind.",1,1744905930.0,TheSanctumWonderland,0,1.0,False

* Received email via patient portal from the surgery coordinator at Downtown Women with information about Prep and Hospital Information.
* Email:

Your procedure is on STANDBY at NYU for Wednesday, April 9, 2025 with Dr Kurihara.-We ask you to put your personal schedule on hold for the entire day above.-We should have a procedure time given to us from NYU by Monday of that week.  (Unfortunately, the OR schedulers only work on a day a few days before the procedures to optimize the flow of the rooms.)

TO PREPARE FOR THE PROCEDUREPlease fill out the ""Pre Surgery Questionnaire"" in your NYU MyChart portal in a week or so if you have access.The doctor will enter the ""orders"" of what you need into the NYU EPIC computer system so all you have to do is show up at NYU Langone.

1. BLOOD DRAW at the NYU Outpatient LabPlease go for your blood draw (during the days/times below) from Tuesday March 18 until Monday April 7.-ALL visits are WALK-IN-NO appointment necessary  -NO fasting necessaryPlease keep in mind that this blood draw is independent and mandatory of any exam or blood work done by any other physician.Also, this is the ONLY location for labs, as it is not just testing but storage in case it is needed during the procedure.ON THE DAY OF THE PROCEDURE-Please DO NOT eat or drink anything 8 HOURS PRIOR TO SURGERY TIME, including water, unless instructed otherwise.However, if you have medications you take daily, you may take them with a sip of water.

\-On the day of the surgery, you will arrive 120 MINUTES prior to your scheduled surgery time at NYU TischPlease go through the entrance, turn right, and follow the green path to the elevators. This will take you to the 2nd Floor Surgical Suite.

\-Please do not bring any jewelry or expensive items. There are small lockers provided for your ID/Insurance Card/paperwork.

\-Wear comfortable and loose fitting clothes.

\-Have an escort (over the age of 18) to pick you up on the MIUU floor. You will not be discharged otherwise.

\-Please schedule a follow up appointment in our office with your surgeon 2-3 weeks post-surgery.

Contact us with any questions or concerns you may have regarding this process or your procedure by responding to this e-mail.

BILLINGDTW only obtains a prior authorization (or a permission) to do the surgery from your insurance if necessary.(We usually do this the week before.)All billing and charges are handled at the venue where the procedure is completed.  That venue is NYU.NYU reaches out to patients at some point the week before their procedure.If you are interested on the patient responsibility before NYU contacts you, we suggest calling the customer service number on the back of your insurance card.We can provide the Procedure (CPT) and diagnosis code(s) if you need them. 



**3/13/25**

I began trying to contact the Hospital Billing Department using the number listed in the email I received in the surgical coordinator’s email. I made three attempts in total. On the first call, I wasn’t able to get through because I didn’t have an account number. During the second attempt, I said “Agent” and was able to reach someone, but while on hold, the call unexpectedly dropped. I tried a third time and had the same result—the call disconnected while I was on hold.

I gave up and switched to calling my insurance company. I called UnitedHealthcare to confirm whether diagnostic code Z30.2 and procedure code 58661 would be considered preventive and fully coveredThe agent confirmed that the codes were correct and that the procedure would be covered as preventive if those codes were used. However, she emphasized that prior authorization is required in order for them to apply. I asked how to obtain prior authorization and was told that my doctor would need to call the provider line or submit the request through the provider portal. This was news to me because my plan does not require prior authorization for any other service so I wouldn’t have known this if I hadn’t called. 

After speaking to the insurance company, I tried the hospital billing department again and was able to reach someone. They explained that my upcoming surgery hasn’t yet appeared in their billing system. This is because, initially, all surgical cases are handled by the Estimation Department. They are responsible for reviewing the case, determining if prior authorization is needed (I let her know that mine does require it), and then submitting that authorization. Once that step is complete, the case is forwarded to Billing—usually about a week or just a few days before the surgery. She also clarified that the diagnostic code used for the procedure is determined by the physician or their office, not by the billing department. In fact, billing won’t know which codes are used until everything is sent over to them. I asked if, in the case of a denied prior authorization due to an incorrect code, there would be a way to call back and possibly negotiate or adjust the codes. They said yes, that would be possible. She recommended I check directly with the physician’s office to confirm which diagnostic code will be used.

Following these two calls, I sent a message to the surgical coordinator at Downtown Women portal to pass along this information about prior authorization and to confirm that codes Z30.2 and 58661 would be used. He wrote back and confirmed these are the codes that will be used and let me know the code for the IUD removable that would also be used is T83.32XD.



**3/28/2025**

I received an email from NYU as well as a text message with a new message in “MyChart” and I was able to follow the link to create an account in NYU MyChart. Once logged in I found two pre-surgery questionnaires which I filled out. They asked for personal and family medical history including prior surgeries and experience with anesthesia, allergies, and current medications.

**3/31/2025**

I went to the NYU outpatient lab to have blood drawn. They ran a PERIOP CBC.

**4/2/2025**

I received a call from an NYU anesthesia nurse with detailed pre-surgery instructions. First they asked me questions (they were all repeated questions from the pre-surgery questionnaire like my medications. They advised that I should not use my Dapsone, any creams or lotions, or my Tretinoin the night before the procedure. I should skip taking medications on the day of surgery, but it’s fine to continue them up until the day before. They also instructed me to stop taking multivitamins, fish oil, vitamin D3, and NSAIDs such as Advil, Motrin, and Aleve. If I need anything for pain or discomfort, Tylenol is the only approved option.

When I told them (again) that I take spironolactone for my skin the nurse said that I need to do a kidney function test because it’s a diuretic and I would need to get blood work done AGAIN asap because they didn’t do the panel that includes the needed test. I asked if I am able to just walk in again like last time and she confirmed. 

They confirmed my surgery was scheduled for 3:30 pm on April 9 with an expected arrival time of 1:00 PM. They told me someone will call again the day before the surgery to provide specific instructions on when to stop eating and drinking. I was also reminded to bring a photo ID and my insurance card, and to wear loose, comfortable clothing on the day of the procedure.

I also received a text from NYU that a new estimate has been uploaded to the MyChart portal. 

The nurse followed up with an email in the NYU MyChart portal below (it also had instructions for where to go in the hospital day of surgery):

“Take the morning of surgery with a sip of water: Iron, spironolactone 

Do Not Take the morning of surgery: NONE

DO NOT TAKE 7 days before surgery: 

All anti-inflammatory medications 

(Advil, Motrin, Aleve, Naproxen)

Adult Support Person

If you are going home on the day of surgery, you will need to have an adult support person (18 years of age or older) with you at your discharge.”



**4/4/2025**

I went to the outpatient lab at NYU again. I let the pathologist know that I had been there already on March 24 and they didn’t run a test that needed to be done. I told them the nurse had told me I needed a test for my kidney function but they didn’t know what that was so they left for a minute and came back and told me they had to ask someone who has been there a long time which test that was and it was a panel that tests potassium levels. They did my blood draw and after she confirmed that sure enough the order for that panel WAS in my chart but it wasn’t obvious which is probably why they missed it the first time because it wasn’t in the same spot as the first basic panel requested. They ran the BASIC METABOLIC PANEL test.



**4/7/2025**

I spoke with someone at NYU Billing who informed me that my updated estimate, which now includes the prior authorization submitted by eHealth Insurance on April 7, still shows a balance of $1,500 owed. I then spoke with UnitedHealthcare, who confirmed that the prior authorization had been approved and that the diagnostic and procedure codes are classified as preventive. They stated that the procedure should be fully covered with no cost-sharing—meaning no deductible or out-of-pocket cost applies. I was given a Reference Number for this confirmation to refer back to. I called NYU Billing again to share what the insurance had told me. I was advised that I can ask at the time of the procedure to have it run through insurance before making any payment. The representative explained that it would be up to the facility whether or not they allow this and they still may require me to pay on site before the surgery. If the procedure is billed directly to insurance, then any remaining balance (if applicable) would be billed to me afterward, based on the insurance company’s response.

This day I also received the following email in the NYU MyChart Portal:

**“HCC2 Surgical Suites PREOP Instructions**

Victoza (Liraglutide)

Saxenda (Liraglutide)

Byetta (Exenatide) 

If you are on any GLP1 Agonist medications, do not eat for at least 12 hours before surgery. Solid food includes anything that is solid, paste, or liquid and has protein or fat, like Ensure or protein shakes. Do this no matter when you stop taking the medication. 

Eating Instructions 

Follow the fasting instructions the RN gave you during the pre-op call.If you do not follow the instructions, your procedure may be delayed or cancelled to ensure your safety. 

*Drinking Instructions* 

The nurse will tell you when to stop drinking clear fluids (apple juice, cranberry juice, Gatorade, black coffee, or tea) based on your surgery/procedure time. 

What to Wear:

*Dress comfortably*

Remove all make up, false eyelashes, dark nail polish, jewelry, and body piercings. We recommend going to a jeweler to remove body piercings or rings that will not come off. If they are unable to be removed, you must tell the nurse before surgery and a jewelry waiver will need to be signed. 

Wear eyeglasses instead of contact lenses. If you wear eyeglasses, bring the case.

If your surgeon instructed you to, use special wipes or shampoo.

Do not use cream, lotion, ointment, powder, perfume, or cologne on the day of surgery.

If you wear dentures, removable bridges or retainers take them out before surgery.

*Insurance Card/ID/Payment*

Please bring a photo ID, insurance card, and a way to pay (in case there is a co-pay or deductible).

*Personal Belongings*

Leave all other valuables at home. You will have access to a locker to keep your things safe during surgery. 

You will be asked to change into a hospital gown and socks. You will also need to take off all undergarments.

*Advanced Directive / Living Will / Health Care Proxy*

Bring your Advanced Directive/Living Will/Health Care Proxy. If you do not have one, you can get it on our website. If needed, bring guardianship paperwork. For more information please visit:

[https://nyulangone.org/patient-family-support/advance-care-planning](https://nyulangone.org/patient-family-support/advance-care-planning)

*Medical Devices* 

If you use a cane, walker, wheelchair, or hearing aid(s), please bring them with you. If you have a case for your hearing aids, please bring it.

*Urine Sample*

We may ask you to give us a urine sample for testing. Please tell staff you are using the restroom before you go. This way staff can give you a small container to collect your urine.

Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding and pumping are welcome in all areas of our hospital.

If you are breastfeeding or pumping, we cannot store breast milk in the pre-op or PACU areas. 

Please store breastmilk with your belongings. Bring a cooler bag or storage container for your breast milk.

We can provide fresh ice as needed. 

*Adult Support Person*

You need an adult support person (18 years of age or older) to be with you at your discharge. Please provide their name and phone number during the Pre-Op Phone call. Your surgery may be delayed or cancelled if you do not have an adult support person.

You can have your support person with you during the intake process (pre-op) and again during the discharge (post-op). They should wait in the HCC2 waiting area or outside of the hospital during your surgery. When you are almost ready to go home, we will let your support person know that they can join you for discharge.

You may choose one person to receive text message updates from a care team member when you are out of surgery. Please note: Staff are not able to respond to these automated messages. Your support person can go to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) as soon as they receive a text that states, “Patient is ready for visit.” 

*Billing*

For any billing questions please contact 

Finance Department: 212-404-3906 

Anesthesia Billing: 877-648-2964.

*Pre-operative Phase (Before Surgery)*

Before your surgery, you will meet the members of your care team. This includes nurses and patient care technicians (PCTs), your surgeon and anesthesiologist.

We will check your vital signs and ask you questions about your health, medications, and past surgeries.

We will also review consent forms with you and ask you to sign them.

When it is time for your surgery, a staff member will take you into the operating room (OR).

Please note: your surgery may be longer or shorter than expected.

*Recovery Phase (After Surgery)*

Once your surgery is finished, we will take you to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU).

Our staff will care for your post-operative (post-op) needs.

It is normal to feel groggy, discomfort and pain, and nausea after your surgery.

Most patients spend about 1-2 hours in the PACU.

Please note: The amount of time you spend in the PACU may vary based on how fast you recover from anesthesia

Depending on your surgery, you may need to urinate (pee) before you can go home. 

Pain/Side Effects

Tell Us How You Feel

We will ask you to describe your pain on a pain scale from 0 to 10. 

0 means no pain

3-4 means mild pain

10 means the worst pain you have ever felt. 

We will give you medications based on your pain level. Our goal is to have your pain be at a 4 or less before you leave the PACU. 

Please note nausea and vomiting are common side effects of anesthesia and may last up to 24 hours after surgery. We will give you medications to try to prevent this. However, if you feel nauseous, please tell your nurse. We want you to be able to eat and drink before you leave the PACU.

*Safety*

Your safety is especially important to us. Please ask for help when getting in and out of bed. A member of your care team may stay with you in the bathroom, where falls can happen more easily. This is to keep you safe. 

Early walking is an important part of your recovery. It improves blood flow, which helps you recover faster. A member of your care team will let you know when it is safe for you to walk. They will be there to guide and support you throughout your recovery.

Preventing Falls While in the Hospital

After your procedure, you may be more likely to fall. Because of this, we will stay with you to keep you S.A.F.E. 

S – Staff will stay with you in the bathroom

A – Anesthesia can increase your risk of falls

F - Feeling dizzy or weak? Let us know!

E - Expect us to be by your side

*Visitor Policies*

Visitors need to show their ID and give their name, contact information and the name of the patient they are visiting. Visitors who do not follow these guidelines will be asked to leave.

For patients having surgery or a same-day procedure at our hospitals and outpatient locations, the following visitor policies are in place:

Adult patients can have 2 support people during the intake process. They can join the patient for a brief time during recovery and again during discharge. Visitors may wait in the waiting area. Exceptions may be made by our clinical team when it is medically necessary for a patient's wellbeing.

Pediatric patients can have 2 support people with them at all times during intake, recovery and discharge. At least one support person must be an adult 18 years of age or older.”



**4/8/2025**

I received a call from NYU where I was asked again about medications and if I plan to take them the day of the surgery. I told them the nurse told me I could take the pills but I am just going to skip them until after the surgery because I normally take them with food and it’s just for my skin so it’s not imperative. She told me my time to arrive at the hospital was 2:15pm (which is different than previous communication I received) and that I could eat a light breakfast before 6am and that I could drink as much water as I wanted until 12pm the day of the surgery. 

The same person called me back a few hours later and said there was a change to my surgery time, that I need to be at the hospital by 1pm. I then received an email from NYU about the schedule but this email said my arrival time was 12:45pm and that my procedure would be at 2:16pm and my new estimated discharge time was 4:34pm. 

I received a text about 7:30 pm from NYU with a digital pass for my appointment with instructions to show it to the front desk to gain access for the day. The address included was slightly different from other instructions for where to report. The text had the address for the building next store to the last email.

1k1gdy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1k1gdy9/hotel_st_paul_montreal/,Hotel St Paul (Montreal),"Just stayed at the Hotel St Paul and just the whole experience compelled me to write a review. 

Summary:
It's a hotel with a modern /artsy vibe trying to be flashy but not getting the fundamentals right.

Check-in: Average (no recognition of status - Titanium, but I didn't care). 

Common Areas: Lobby was bright and modern looking. Doorman never smiled or said a word (but he opened the door).  Elevator was very dark with minimal lighting. I couldn't find the key card tap in the elevator (since it was black!) for a while since the lighting was so dim.  Gym was small but adequate. No water in the gym.

Room: Average, but lots of small issues. Bathtub didn't drain fast enough, so showered in about an inch of soapy water. The airflow in the bathroom basically had the shower curtain blowing into the shower area while the shower was running. Lower bathtub tap didn't seal properly so shower and bath faucet were running simultaneously. Conditioner bottle was empty. Sink was modern with flat base, so it also didn't drain properly. Clothes iron was rusted and dripped water out as I ironed. Thermostat did not work (room was cold despite thermostat saying it was 27C). Free water bottle in room was full but already opened (realized when I got to the gym).

Food: Breakfast buffet where I had eggs, sausage, and small salad was $35. Coffee not included $7. + Tax + tip for a total of $56. In fairness, I could have had more items from the buffet, but coffee not included is annoying.

Conclusion: The hotel needs to focus on the little details rather than the superficial flashy vibe. Would not stay again.

I’m (26M) a native Spanish speaker living and working in Paris, France (3 years in total) at the moment. I have lived previously in Australia and the US as a student in academic exchanges. All in all, I would rate my English proficiency very high (C1 to C2), as well as having a high level in French (very solid C1). I can speak all three languages in a corporate environment.

I'm a very outgoing person that loves to meet new cultures and try new cuisines. Very talkative and interested in music, economics/finance and sports. We’ll find something to talk about. 

Interested in German because of music; at least that’s how I got into it. There is a piece by Liszt called Liebestraume that still haunts me for its beauty. Among other reasons, I like the passion that the language portrays and I’m curious of its influence in the English language. I would objectively rate my level at barely an A2 level.

When I changed jobs to work elsewhere, I asked for it to be returned to my personal email which it was originally set up to have, but told “this is not possible, you have to create a new account”. Eff you, that’s bullshit on so many levels, but not worth pursuing. I could and can still use the app just fine and I don’t have any special features (again, that takes special back end edits to enable for each upgrade or feature being tested).

With no special access, it likely wasn’t deemed to be of any risk, HOWEVER so many companies have unpublished discounts auto applied to all purchases made by employees.

For YEARS, I’ve received surprise discounts ranging from 5%-40% and/or free shipping, one item was a special “at cost” just pay shipping and a request for reviews, on: mattresses and bedding for the kids; garden tools & seeds; an axe; coffee beans; kitchenware and gadgets; clothing; home tech (surround sound, alarm clocks, headphones, coffee maker); and more. So businesses selling with that app my former employer created were collectively shorted well over $1,000 of potential revenue from me alone.

Though the world around it screamed and burned, its surface remained unscorched—light rippling across its armored flanks like moonlight on water. It didn’t breathe, but it hummed, a low purr in its titanium lungs, never truly still.

Inside, the air was cool. Always.

He sat in the driver’s seat—Elias, fifteen, pale-haired and sharp-featured, with eyes too calm for war. His skin was porcelain, his mind an architect’s maze. The others called him “The Maker,” though he never claimed it aloud. The truth was… the car came to him in a dream. He awoke with blueprints fully formed, and built it with his hands alone.

Solar-powered. Self-sustaining. Unbreakable. Always locked from the inside. Only he knew how it lived.

Behind him, across the cushioned rear seat, lay Rhea—early twenties, dark red bandana across her brow, boots off, legs curled under a wool blanket. Strong shoulders slackened in sleep. The rumble of distant mortars didn’t faze her. They never did. She’d stopped flinching months ago. Her rifle leaned on the armrest, but she hadn’t used it in days. In here, she didn’t need to.

They were above war. Carried by it.

In the passenger seat, Jalen stirred gently. His skin the color of rich earth, his eyes soft even when the world outside shrieked like a dying thing. He barely spoke, but his silence was worship. When they found him—starving, frostbitten—Elias had opened the side hatch for the first time in weeks.

Jalen cried when he stepped inside. Not from pain. From peace.

The three of them existed in a loop of motion and stillness. The machine drove when it chose, idled when it felt the world press too hard. Inside, food was synthesized from solar gain—bread, fruit, coffee. Showers misted in privacy-curtains. Beds folded from seatbacks. There was even music—low, analog, pulsing in the bones.

Outside: ruin.

Inside: home.

They didn’t speak often. They didn’t need to. In here, you felt more than you said. The car carried them through battlefields like a god wearing chrome. Bullets flattened against the fenders. Rockets melted to vapor before they touched steel. No hatch had ever been breached. No fire ever reached the cabin.

It was invincible.

When the official start time hit, I made a beeline for all the spots I had mapped out in my brain. Sure enough, when I opened my eggs, I had found both winning tickets. Immediate guilt. 

I offered to put one back and suggested we draw numbers or something so someone else could win the second prize.

It’s all downhill from here.” But it never got any easier. The +16,000 ft [4,876 m] passes kept coming.
 
First the “Hill of Black Death” along Bolivia’s prismatic “Lagunas” route. Then a week of 75-mile days across the Atacama Desert in northern Chile and Argentina. Two days of pavement felt like a luxury. I found kiwi fruits in a small village called Susques and thought I was hallucinating. Then I reconnected with gravel backroads toward San Antonio de los Cobres and Abra del Acay, the highest point on the famed Ruta 40.
 
“Ripios,” a rough translation for washboards and rubble, became a dirty word passed between touring cyclists and moto-travelers. It foreshadowed more than bad roads. It meant heartbreak ahead. Either rough rocky shrapnel or coarse sand that was too deep to ride in. Los ripios were a plague that we couldn’t avoid, asking how long it lasted and where the worst parts were. More bumbling jeep tracks in a Mars-like desert. More cold nights in the tent and savoring each drop of camp coffee before the road sat up to meet me like a clay-colored fist.
 
I looked vampiric at the summit of Abra del Acay [16,060 ft or 4,895 m], covered in chalky dust and struggling to catch my breath. I crouched behind a small altar to add more winter layers against the cyclonic battering of wind. A tawny orange fox was there too, pawing at the rocks in search of food.
 
Daylight cratered fast in the valley below, as did its frigid temps. I raced south toward lower elevations to camp for the night. More inescapable desert and rusted canyons.

we finally met over coffee and it was good. but i ended up getting feelings for him for all that connection before and how charming he was. but later whenever i would visit his city. he would only ever talk about a place for hookup. i never did. but he would always make plans to meet somewhere else and would disappear. i gave him benefit of doubt and didn't mind. but once he made plans again and disappeared. i waited two days for him but there were no signs of him. i had the worst panic attack of life and went away and remove him from socials. he was trying to approach me on whatsapp later but i didn't fall for it. 

this year. he approached again as he was supposed to be in my hometown. i stupidly agreed to meet thinking he might have something to apologise. but he didn't. we just made out and were together for five hours. he was very kind and caring and i thought it would be different. but it wasn't. he disappeared for the next 47 days. i was very hurt and removed him. and now he is trying to approach again on socials. 

i literally confessed everything, how he hurt me in a pretty long message and blocked him. but i still somehow can not let go of attachment. i healed for a whole year just to put myself in the same spot. 

i keep wondering would it have been easier to accept his terms and play along whenever he needed me. but i also cannot forget the blow my self estem took when i had panic attack. and sought pyshiatric help due to him. he always comes back but only when he wants and only when i am exhausted.",2,1744905242.0,LGBTQpakistan,1,1.0,False
1k1g6qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Venus_Vacation/comments/1k1g6qv/just_gushing_over_this_game_for_about_7_paragraphs/,Just gushing over this game for about 7 paragraphs!,"It’s so refreshing playing a social/romance sim with such high production values like this. Games like this just do not get made very often. The fact that there is an English translation, even though it’s relegated to Asian import editions only, feels like a small miracle in of itself, too. 

I actually really like that overall, there is more of a focus on the story here and getting to know characters rather than just mindlessly trying to unlock swimsuits like in Xtreme 3. The pacing is great - each scene is fairly short, but the dialogue choices feel pretty meaningful, and the scenarios they put you in with the characters are a really good balance between realism and the kind of stuff you’d read in a romance story. 

So far, the characters all feel distinct - only on my first playthrough, but I NEVER replay games and yet am so excited to do that here, just to better get to know them all.

The photography is really well executed, and I like that there is more of a focus on shot composition and the actual artistry of photography, rather than just taking risqué photos. There’s still space for that, but it feels less overbearing/pervy here and a bit more mature/classy. It feels like the game has more respect for its characters while still allowing room for player expression.

They nailed the setting, the mood is so relaxing, playing this game with a cup of coffee on a chilly day is just a vibe.

I’m fresh off playing games that are loud and in your face, or have a thousand things for you to do. I love that this game encourages you to slow down, bask in the setting, and take the social elements and photography mechanics however you want to go about it.

If Koei Tecmo were to keep making games in this style - perhaps with totally different casts and settings that have no connection to DOA at all - they could have a really cool formula on their hands. Imagine a game with the same general mechanics set in modern day Tokyo, with this level of production values, where maybe you are running a fashion brand or something. There’s just so much potential. (just please… bring them to the US!)

- Jax: Everybody, welcome back to In The Mind Of Jax Taylor. I think you guys noticed that, or maybe some of you didn't notice that, but we changed the title. We are In The Mind Of Jax Taylor. I just think it's a little bit more...
- Schwartz: That is a scary, dark place.
- Jax: I know, it's a very scary, you know, I was thinking about the title. I'm like, it's a little bit too common to be like, in the mind of a man, because let's be honest, I haven't really been living up to the man thing lately. So, I'd say In The Mind Of Jax Taylor. And I think it's a little funnier.

Did Jax watch the first episode of The Valley? (Timestamp: 3:25)
- Jax: I have seen the first episode. I'm not going to lie to you. And people were like, okay, the first episode's out. The first two episodes are extremely difficult for me. And I watched the first episode. I was going back and forth.
- Jax: I was calling the producers. I'm like, should I watch this? Should I watch this?Then I'm like, I don't want to watch this. They're like, Jax, listen, it was a year ago. The show was shot a year ago. You are in a different place. If you weren't in a different place, I would say, no, don't watch it. But you know what?
- Jax. You've grown a lot from this first episode. I think you should watch it. I think you should watch it and see, okay, this is a place where you never want to get back to again. So yes.
- Schwartz: Wow, that's good, Jax. You're showing growth. And I will say just for the audience, it's significant that Jax has watched an episode because I don't think he watched one episode of Vanderpump Rules in the history of the show.
- Jax: No, and I used to get so much shit up for it from Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live. He's like, you know you're doing press. Why don't you watch the shows?
- Jax: I'm like, listen, Andy, have you ever seen a season where it was good for me? Okay, I know what questions I'm getting. I know where they're directed at and trust me, I remember everything that I've done for the most part.
- Jax: I know I was probably under the influence for a lot of the stuff I've done, but I do remember most of it. But that being said, I did watch it. I sat in the corner and I cried my eyes out.
- Jax: I was so disgusted about what I saw about that shell of a human being that I was looking at, about how I acted. It was just utter disgust. And you know, I looked at it and be like, wow, I'm glad I watched this because I never want to be that person again.
- Schwartz: That's, I mean, dude, those are some powerful words. And how many days sober are you?
- Jax: I think 139. 139 I'm at and going strong, have no interest in drinking or touching drugs again. I don't even have a, I thought for sure I was going to have a little bit of a, like, how am I going to be tempted?
- Jax: Because you know, I still go out a little bit and I still go to restaurants, but I am not tempted at all. What I'm having a hard time with though, I will tell you, is being social, is not like using, I always use a drink as a buffer. 
- Jax: I need, I have to have a cocktail or something in my hand. It's kind of like a liquid courage. I don't know how to start up conversations and seem interested if I don't have a drink in my hand. So I'm learning.
- Schwartz: Yeah. And also there's some interesting alternatives, which we don't have to get into. But me and you did an episode of my podcast, which is launching soon
- Schwartz: We don't have to get into that now, but things like Kava, Adaptogen, Social Tonics, you guys go down the rabbit hole. There's some great alternatives to give you a nice, mild, pleasant buzz. Or if you're California sober, it's really nice too.
- Jax: I am California sober. That's yeah. And like I said, the Kava we tried, you know, I'll dabble in a couple Celsiuses. I know that I'm going to be out. I'll take a Celsius or two and or a Red Bull, whatever. But yeah, that's just it's not difficult, but it's just I have to really psych myself up if I know I'm going to be in a large group where people are drinking.
- Schwartz: Also, you own a bar. Listen, this could be a controversial take, but I think being a great bar owner is also getting in there, taking a shot with them, celebrating their moments. Obviously, you're in a unique situation. You can't do that. And you got to have healthy boundaries.
- Jax: I let people know now. I just say I'm not drinking. I don't make it like I'm sober. I just say I'm not drinking.
- Schwartz: You’re taking a break. 
- Jax: I'm taking a little bit of a break. And a lot of people know, a lot of people have been following my story the last few months and my sobriety journey.
- Jax: And a lot of people are good about it now. I've gone into the bar a few times, like, hey, can we do a mocktail shot with you, whatever? 
- They talk about how a lot of celebrities these days seem to not be drinking 
- Jax: Here's the thing. I have nothing against alcohol. I just don't like the person I become afterwards.
- Schwartz: Everything moderation.
- Jax: You know, I become a very, very dark, dark human being, you know, and I don't like that person. And you know, like I said, it's just, I'm not the type of person that can have a beer with dinner. I have to have 10

Are there any things, and I say this respectfully, but is there any part of it you miss? (Timestamp: 8:10)
- Jax: I don't miss any of it. I watched back the episode. I just look how sweaty and my eyes are bulging and I'm out of shape. I was like skin. I just gave myself the itch. I 100% gave myself the itch. I looked disgusting. I was like 180 pounds. I just look gross and I never want to get back.
- Jax: As much as I work out and take care of my body now, I could never put alcohol back in my body knowing what it does to it.
- Schwartz: Yeah, I mean in moderation, it's fine. But yeah, if you start to lose control and it leads to other things, slippery slopes, which we don't have to get into.
- Jax: No, it did. I always like to say alcohol was a problem, but the main problem for me was cocaine. And I could not have a drink. As soon as I had a drink, I was looking for a bag of cocaine every single time.

How open are you about your past cocaine use (timestamp: 8:59)
- Jax: I’m very open 
- Schwartz: Can I tell them your tell?
- Jax: Oh yeah, tell them my tell. 
- Schwartz: So Jax always had a tell. I could always tell if he was just having a beer. Because lots of times I would go out with Jax and he would just have a drink. Jax, you were never a huge drinker, but it was a gateway for you. 
- Jax: And you could always tell if Jax was on cocaine. Because the way he, give me that glass over there. He would go from holding his drink like, can I have a sip of this?
- Jax: You can, it’s coffee
- Schwartz: He would go from holding his cup like this. And if he was on cocaine...
- Jax: I would hold it underneath.
- Schwartz: Not to mention his eyes were bulging out of his skull. (They both laugh)
- Schwartz: I’m just kidding 
- Jax: People would be like, God, that guy sure must have a bladder problem because he's gone to the bathroom a hundred times in the last five minutes.
- Schwartz: You had a sixth sense for finding it too. You guys, I don't know if we're allowed to make light of this because you're in a great place right now.
- Jax: I am. And you know what? I am. And I don't want to make fun of it because it's a serious, serious thing. You kind of have to look back and be like, wow, I did. I had a sixth sense for finding it. No matter where we were, what state or country we were in, I found it within minutes.
- Schwartz: Within half hour tops. Yeah. Doesn't matter where we are.
- Jax: It got to the point where I needed it to be social. It was a social drug for me. In the beginning days, in the early days, I did it, of course, because I like to rise.
- Jax: But towards the end, I did it just to stay awake. It was just like because I would crash around nine or 10 o'clock. Anyway, I don't want to get too much of that.
- Jax: Everybody is going to see my journey on The Valley Season 2. You're going to see it. It's really rough. The first two episodes are fucking rough, man.
- Schwartz: You saw the first two episodes.
- Jax: No, I'm sorry. I saw the first episode. I got the second episode today. I'm going to watch it, but it's going to be real, real rough. And the thing is, I know where I am at today, and I'm okay to look back and be like, man, I was a bad person because I'm a pretty strong person today, and I've worked so hard to get where I'm at. 
- Jax: And also, keep in mind, the show was shot a year ago. I am in a different place. I have different relationships. You know, the dynamic has changed. So I can look back and like, wow, I've grown a lot from that.

Valley premiere party (Timestamp: 22:09)
- Jax: And I noticed that Jesse and Aaron (Michelle’s boyfriend) got into a little scuffle. In fact, I noticed that Aaron fell on the red carpet. He fell and Jason had to pick him up. He was blitzed. Yeah, it's all over the tabloids today
- Jax: It got picked up. Jesse sent me all the stuff today. He's like Us Weekly, all these Bravo blogs, whatever, picked up the fight that, or not the fight. I guess it wasn't a fist fight. It was an argument. 
- Jax: And then the fact that he was hammered and he fell on the red carpet. So I'm not really spoiling anything. Like I said, it's in the tabloids right now. So he fell.
- Jax: Jason had to pick him up. And then there was some arguing going back and forth. And Jesse was there, but he was there by himself because Lacey was not feeling very well. But it was an interesting dynamic.

Jax’s bar (Timestamp: 29:04)
- Schwartz: It's hard on your personal relationships. It's hard on your sleeping habits. If you're really, you know, if you're running, managing a bar, I'd like to take a second to give a shout out to everyone in the bar and restaurant industry. Jax.
- Jax: I know, and I've cut back a lot. Like I've cut back a lot. Like you said, I was there all the time. And now that I'm going through this new journey in my life, I've really limited myself there. I go in there during the day. I try not to be there past five o'clock
- Jax: You know, I go in on the weekends. If there's an event, or there's a sporting event, or somebody has a party, and like, a lot of these people have parties at my bar because they're hoping to see somebody, you know? 
- Jax: So I'll try to be in there for that. I'll shake some hands, kiss some babies, do that kind of thing, and then I'll take off. I don't hang out there anymore like I used to
- Schwartz: And that's why, if you see me, I'm helping promote once in a while here and there. I'll pop in and help you out. I know you need to step away more often.
- Jax: I am going to be stepping away. I think you're going to see that coming in the future. I just think for my new journey, I don't think it's a good idea for me to be 100% there and I need to work on myself and be a little bit more there with my family. I'm appreciating you stepping in and helping out.
- Schwartz: Just here and there, yeah.
- Jax: Until we figure out what we're going to do, I think my goal is to get you a little bit more on board, hopefully in the future, if it's something that you're interested in. We're definitely going to be doing a remodel shortly here within the next week or two. Tom's been involved with that because I really like, 
- Jax: I love Schwartz and Sandys. I think the inside, other than the location, the inside was absolutely amazing and he's got a lot of good ideas. And I think you just did an amazing job building such a beautiful place.
- Schwartz: Thanks, dude.
- Jax: I think you have a lot of really good taste. And I want to incorporate that into the new bar.
- Schwartz: You're scaring the audience away. Nobody wants a Schwartz and Sandys 2.0.
- Jax: It's not. 
- Schwartz: Nobody wants that. 
- Jax: I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about your decor and how you're really good at your decor and your artistic abilities to make a beautiful place. You made a really, really pretty bar.

I did a personal best deadlift,"M25 five foot ten, 266lbs working out at home. Today I had an Actimel yogurt shot, a protein shake and a coffee. Did a few hip hinges to warm up and some other misc things. Got an 80s bass guitar gifted to me as I was preparing my hip-hinges, so I ended up distracted when I should've been working out lmao. Eventually got into the garage.

First time I did a deadlift of 34kg, not much at all I know. But for me it was my personal best as I've only done a max of 30kg so far as my form has been all over the place. Finally today I felt I did a few sets of worthwhile lifts no problem. But then on set 3/4 instead of lower back pain I got mid-back pain. I was doing everything correctly so maybe the load was too much or I rushed it and lost focus. No matter, I am still proud of actually doing this lift somewhat correctly. The only problem is picking it up as I'm pretty unflexible with not much muscle mass, so a lot of this is learning the muscle coordination.

Anyway after this I felt drained, completely zapped of energy unlike previous weeks. I was going to try and curl 10kg dumbells to see if I could complete a set of ten. I couldn't find the motivation to do it so I just went with my usual 7.5kg dumbells instead. Barbell row form was a bit all over the place but I managed some good sets but I think the weight isn't heavy enough (18kg). Face pulls with dumbells I had to take off more weight so they were only 5kg. Then lat pullovers at 7.5kg where I had to hold the dumbell like a rolling pin to get a balanced feel on my arms. 

I feel good for completing the workout don't get me wrong, I just found myself wasting around for so much time. Pacing my garage thinking about random things, stalling the next set/exercise and just wanting the whole thing to be over. I am only on my first month and a half of doing this with no previous experience but still. Just felt uninspiring. I could have probably added a bit of weight to my lat pullovers and bent over rows. I could have probably done another set of dumbell curls and I could have tried 10kg ones as well. Face pulls are like a shot in the dark, have no clue what I am doing. Some weights are leaking sand (pullovers were fun lets just say) and every time I do a deadlift I feel like I do something wrong (despite hundreds of comments telling me how to do it properly). So overall today just sucked, but still did the exercises I guess.

 something that lets you search and filter beans based on *flavor notes*   such as 

*  Raisin
* Dark chocolate
* Malt
* Roasted Hazelnut

and or sliders for 

* nutty
* chocolatey
* fruity 
* citrus
* floral

The goal is to make it easier to find new roasts or origins that actually match your taste.

Right now, most of us browse roaster websites or rely on barista recommendations but there’s no unified way to explore coffees purely by flavor.

So I’m curious:

* How do *you* usually find new coffees you enjoy?
* Do you go by origin, roast level, word of mouth, or tasting notes?
* Would you use an app where you could vote on the flavors you taste (flavor polling), and get recommendations based on your own flavor profile?

Would love to hear how others approach discovery and if a tool like this would actually be useful or just overkill

Right now, I’m focused on indexing roasters and beans by their described flavor notes. But in the next iteration, I want to build **community-driven flavor profiling** where users can *vote* on what flavors they actually tasted, and over time build a more accurate, crowd-sourced flavor map for each coffee.

So, I started working for a repair shop. They said I'd be paid 7.50 the first two weeks, at the end of the two weeks I'd get a check and they'd either keep me or let me go. So, I guess they decided to keep me as I've been working for 4 weeks now. Completely full time. 3 out of the 4 weeks I worked overtime.

Here's the thing. I haven't been paid at all. I have asked twice what all they needed for me to get paid, and they said a copy of my social card and my ID. I got them both to them the next day. I have put in 2 time cards so far. The first time I said I haven't been paid yet he said it was because I hadn't turned in a time sheet yet. 

So, I'm about to go on a full month without getting paid. The only reason I'm still even working here is in hopes I do actually get paid, and it's a large sum because of how much I've been working.

Well, in the past 2 weeks I've been getting referred to as the intern. Like literally. They say heres an intern. The other half of the time they call me one of the techs. 

Here's the thing. Besides himself, he has 2 other techs besides me. I have no idea what they're paid. One of them is his daughter.


I'm getting more and more impatient and it's getting to the point my mental state is completely fucked. 

I have worked over 160 hours this month and all I have been handed was a 10 dollar bill because I hadn't been paid to buy myself food, and the other was today, because I stayed for an extra 45 minutes and helped a customer. The customer gave my boss an extra 10 for and I quote, ""coffee money""

I decided to lurk for an extra minute to get my shit put away so I could go home, and he hands me the 10 the customer gave me, asking me if I learned anything. 

The only thing he's training me on is the procedures they do before giving the computer back to the customer.

I want to say that while I have some mixed feelings about specific changes (why on God's green earth are we buffing Breakout in the same patch where we're getting a god tier bodyblocking perk?) I think it's a lot more relevant to talk about some of the perks (and killer addons) which *weren't* changed to account for the Haste stacking change:

#Survivor

~~I am not going to be talking about Exhaustion perks for rather self-evident reasons: these perks stacking was never the primary reason people ran them.~~

###Blood Pact and Teamwork: Power of Two

These are probably the prime example of Haste perks that were pretty much only useful when stacked since their Haste values are far too low to be useful. Even then the RNG nature of the Obsession for Blood Pact and the low Haste for Power of Two made these perks essentially useless outside of being abused in gimmick builds. These perks were essentially only useful when combined (12% Haste yum I love moving at nearly the same speed as the killer with no counterplay) or when combined with other Haste perks like Made For This or Dark Theory.

Now I will say that these are probably one of few Haste perks that were actually very problematic when stacked: again Power of Two and Blood Pact combined made you nearly as fast as a regular 115% killer and objectively faster than a 110% killer with the only counterplay being ""knock one of them down lol"" was objectively unhealthy for the game. The thing is this required such a specific set of circumstances (good map, your duo is the Obsession, they get injured, you heal them) that you never saw this combo used. Even then I think both these perks are fun and have their niche so it would be nice if they could be changed.

Power of Two I think could be buffed to 7% (Blood Pact's values) and wouldn't be problematic, especially since the Haste doesn't stack with Babysitter or Exhaustion perks anymore. The range could also be buffed slightly (20 meters?) to make it easier to use. This would make it a nice utility perk to put into healing builds that isn't just ""durrr faster heals"" and would also serve more use in these healing builds.

As for Blood Pact? I honestly think the perk is deserving of a rework to separate it from the Obsession mechanic. While I love the perk thematically it's too hard to use outside of a coordinated environment, and even *when* coordinating with a duo it requires a lot of finagling to be useful. Not to mention that with the addition of Power of Two, Blood Pact has always felt like ""worse Power of Two."" Personally I think a good rework for Blood Pact would be something along the lines of this:

>Upon healing a survivor, they become your bonded Blood Pact. You are able to see the aura of your Blood Pact survivor, regardless of range.

>In addition, while you are within **12/16/20** meters of your Blood Pact survivor, you both gain a **7%** Haste. (THERE IS NO LINGERING EFFECT TO THIS.)

>You can only have one Blood Pact survivor at a time. Blood Pact is broken if you bond with another survivor, or if either of you enter the Dying state.

This is meant to be a middle ground between Aftercare and Power of Two, giving you both aura reading and a buff when close together. This can be nice if you want to take bodyblock hits for your Blood Pact teammate. I didn't want a lingering effect since I didn't want this perk to overlap too much with Power of Two, and in all honesty even then I'm not sure if this perk isn't just ""better Power of Two"" now. I am just throwing out numbers in a purely hypothetical sense and I don't want people to latch onto the numbers exclusively but rather the core concept of the perk.

Other than that? I honestly don't see any way to buff Blood Pact without it becoming overpowered. Even if you increase the range it presents a problem of the Blood Pact survivor crouching in a corner while you loop the killer with Made For This x2. But if Power of Two is buffed to 7%, Blood Pact becomes useless. But if Power of Two remains a measly 5% with no Haste stacking, it's largely useless.

###Borrowed Time

I'm going to be honest: this perk has kinda eternally had the problem where Babysitter is just better in most situations. 30 seconds of 10% Haste is significantly stronger than 20 seconds of 7% Haste. The extra Endurance is only useful against Ranged killers and ultra-speedy killers who can reliably hit you 10 seconds after you're unhooked and reliably stay behind you when you have 10% Haste. This perk doesn't need changes, imo.

###Babysitter

A fine perk on its own and probably one of the main reasons Haste got nerfed, honestly. Stacking Babysitter with even the simplest Haste perks quickly grew absurd: Babysitter + Made For This equaled 13% Haste, making you nearly as fast as the killer for the low low cost of ""getting hit when unhooked"" (made even easier with Off The Record or Dead Hard). Dark Theory would increase base Babysitter to 12%, and Babysitter + MFT to 15%, officially making you the same speed as the killer.

Probably the most problematic thing to stack with Babysitter however was the limited Halloween syringe, which gives you a whopping 5% Haste. If the survivor who unhooks you pops this on you, you're moving at 115% already. Again that's killer speed already. Add any other source of Haste stacking and it becomes even crazier. This isn't even mentioning how your teammate can pop both a Halloween Syringe and a regular Pink Syringe on you to give you an extra health state, which then allows you to extend the chase further by healing Deep Wound to use Dead Hard.

Babysitter doesn't need buffs. It's already a very strong perk.

###Champion of Light and Chemical Trap

Listing these two perks together as they were the only way to apply Hinder to the killer, ergo they were the only way to stack Hinder on the killer. I mean honestly stacking CoL and CT for 70% Hinder was a meme anyways.

The problem with buffing Chemical Trap is that as a perk it sorta inherently hurts low tiers more than high tiers. If a Pig breaks a god pallet with Chemical Trap they lose a lot of distance, but if a Blight breaks a pallet with Chemical Trap they'll catch up anyways. Similarly a Huntress will just throw hatchets and a Nurse doesn't even care about the pallet in the first place. Hot take but Chemical Trap is poorly designed and therefor can't be buffed.

###Fixated

So Fixated is a Haste perk now. I guess it can’t stack with Dark Theory anymore?

I mean, the only synergy was with Champion of Light, and that perk was buffed to compensate for Fixated becoming a Haste perk. Weird and unnecessary change that affects nothing.

###Plot Twist

Okay so you can’t stack Plot Twist and Sprint Burst anymore. Truthfully nobody was stacking this in any serious capacity: the Haste was only there to compensate for you taking a nap mid-match.

###Tenacity

Tenacity is a Haste perk now??? It says so on the PTB I guess: 50% Haste while crawling. I mean, oh no we can’t use Dark Theory while slugged.

###Urban Evasion

See Fixated. Nobody was stacking this, weird change overall, but I guess we can’t crouch 102% faster with Dark Theory.

###Halloween Syringes

Not a ""perk"" but it's the only source of Haste (or like, a Clown throwing yellow bottles at them?) outside of perks that Survivors can get. Put simply: these things are so easy to use and so abundant that they don't need buffs. It's already extremely frustrating to have a survivor pop a syringe in your face: they don't need to be 7% faster as well. ""But they're only available during Halloween!"" I have 184 of these on my main survivor and like 50 of them on survivors I don't even play. They are not remotely rare for survivors who want to hoard them.

I will admit the problem with Halloween syringes is that the base pink syringe is too strong, but that's another discussion for another day. Simply put if the Halloween syringes were separated from the instaheal syringes (perhaps made into their own item idk) it wouldn't be nearly as problematic to buff them.

#Killer Perks

###Batteries Included

Of all the perks not buffed I was baffled this wasn't one of them because... this perk exists almost *entirely* to be stacked, right? I can not thing of a single person who raw-dogged Batteries in their build: it was almost always a synergy perk alongside NOED or like... at least alongside Rapid Brutality. The only killer who could use this perk outside of Haste stacking builds is Hag and like... *it's Hag.*

This perk could be buffed to 7% and nobody would care. Hell, this perk could probably be buffed to 10% and nobody would care except the Hag mains.

###Forced Hesitation

Nobody was stacking this with anything except *maybe* Clown, and even if a Clown stacked this perk I doubt it was ever intentional. This perk is already absurdly strong and has never really been stacked. It doesn't need buffs.

###Game Afoot

""But you only used this perk to swap the Obsession!"" That doesn't mean the Haste part needs to be *completely* worthless! If Unbound got buffed, the perk that by all accounts is ""more situational Unbound"" (have to be chasing the Obsession, have to break a pallet) should be buffed too. Plus it would bring some of that fun Haste build shenanigans back since it synergizes with Furtive Chase, which also got buffed.

###Devour Hope

Nobody was using this for the 5% Haste after hooking a survivor lol. Hell, I could genuinely argue this could be added as a basekit mechanic to allow killers to more easily transition between hooks (as long as the Haste ended when starting a chase).

###Machine Learning

An already absurdly overtuned perk to compensate for the awful activation condition. While Machine Learning *was* used in Haste stacking builds the perk is already kinda insane and buffing it to even 12% would be absolutely crazy. If you got it to activate you could have a killer like Infinite Tier 3 Myers walking around at 127% movement speed (nearly 3 stacks of Bloodlust) with no Terror Radius for 45 seconds.

Unless this perk is reworked entirely to not require a *specific* generator you kicked to be finished, this perk can't be buffed without being problematic, but also can't be nerfed.

###Rapid Brutality

I think this perk is *fine*, however Rapid has always had a problem that it heavily relies on being used either by killers who can easily close the gap (Clown, Hag, Singularity) or are running Save the Best for Last. Given that two of its main users (Clown and Singularity) have lost the ability to use it, I think a buff would make sense.

You *could* hypothetically buff it to 7%, but I feel like that just makes Rapid stronger on the killers who can already use it well. Personally I'd prefer if Rapid was changed so that the Haste only activates after your attack animation is over: this would be a great Quality of Life update to not only make the perk more useful overall, but stop it from being hard-run alongside STBFL.

###Shadowborn

The memeist of meme perks. I mean, this perk as a whole needs a rework as its easily one of the worst in the game. Nightlight currently lists it as the 5th least used killer perk in the game, only beaten by (from ""best"" to worst): Hoarder, Shattered Hope, Septic Touch, and Hangman's Trick.

###Agitation

Interestingly this perk pops up when I search up ""Haste"" even though not being tagged as a Haste perk? Anyways it's more than fine and nobody's stacking this with Haste perks.

###Hex: No One Escapes Death

People weren't *really* running NOED for the Haste but it would be a lie to say that Haste stacking wasn't a big reason this perk was run. Thing is the Haste stacking was primarily done with perks like Batteries Included or specific killers (we'll get to them). It's less that NOED needs buffs and more than the perks / killer (addons) that were used alongside NOED need buffs because they can't stack with NOED anymore.

###Hex: Nothing but Misery

Been using this perk a lot more than the average guy and I have to admit it's severely underrated. It did also stack well with Clown and Freddy, so the lack of Hinder stacking is notable for those two killers. Even so the duration of this perk is so long I doubt the lack of stacking on two killers is going to change anything.

The real problem with Nothing but Misery is the amount of stacks needed to activate it. I think reducing the required stacks to 6 would be a great quality of life change. And again if Freddy and Clown can't stack it they'll be fine, as again the duration is so long that getting this perk faster would still be a great chase aid.

###Knockout

I'm gonna be honest: this perk is doo doo garbage and is literally ONLY good on Clown and like, 5 other killers? Not only is 5% Hinder freaking nothing, and 5 seconds freaking nothing, but the perk also doesn't work if you break the pallet prior to chasing the survivor? Like at first I thought the low values was to stop this perk from being insane on Nemesis or Demogorgon, but BHVR already seem to have planned for that. This means the perk is basically only useful on like, Huntress, Clown, Freddy, Wesker (if playing around god pallets), Chucky, and Kaneki?

Could be buffed to 7% and 7 seconds and it would be fine.

###Play With Your Food

PWYF is... odd. There's two problems with the perk:

1. It's strong on its own but was absolutely used in Haste stacking builds.

2. Any numerical buff you give to the perk is effectively multiplied by 3.

The second problem is a far bigger issue than the first. Put simply you can't buff PWYF to 6% because that suddenly turns 15% Haste at 3 stacks to 18% Haste which is very problematic when used by Myers, Leatherface, Pinkie Finger Clown, Plague, etc.

I think the solution to PWYF is to separate the Haste values and make it so earlier stacks provide more value. If you change the perk from 5/5/5 to, say... 7/5/4, then the perk retains a balanced 16% at max stacks but is stronger at 1 (7%) and 2 (13%) stacks to make up for the lack of stacking.

#Killers and their addons

###Trapper

It may be surprising to hear that Trapper is actually one of the biggest victims of the Haste change. Many people forget that Trapper gets a 7.5% Haste when setting a trap, and ""Trapper the Clown"" builds were fun to run for the sake of a laugh. Truthfully however I don't think the 7.5% Haste Trapper gets baseline *needs* a significant buff. I mean, it *could* be buffed to 8%? I'd rather see the duration increased to 7 or even 10 seconds though.

**Coffee Grounds** however definitely needs a buff. This addon was only useful in Haste meme builds and 12.5% Haste isn't going to cut it. I'd like to see Coffee Grounds buffed to 7.5% extra Haste, giving Trapper 15% total Haste when using this addon to make the Aggressive Trapper playstyle more viable.

###~~Hag~~

~~Know for a fact Waterlogged Shoe doesn't count as Haste, which is good because if it did that addon would be dead in the water. Pun unintended.~~

Oh yeah the 9% Hinder from **Waterlogged Shoe**! I mean, was anyone stacking this with Knockout? *Maybe* it could be a problem because it doesn't stack with Nothing but Misery anymore, but ima be real you're moving at 117.5% with Shoe: turning 9% Hinder into 14% Hinder wasn't the reason you were getting downs. The Hinder doesn't need buffs, especially since most Shoe Hags were pairing the addon alongside Scarred Hand anyways.

###Huntress

Hey does anyone remember that **Leather Loop** and **Infantry Belt** now give 2% Haste and 3% Haste respectively? I sure don't! These addons could be buffed to 5% and 7% and nobody would give a shit. Huntress has infinitely better addons: these ones have honestly needed buffs for awhile.

~~Soldier's Puttee does not count as Haste. Even if it did nobody runs this addon and it could genuinely be buffed to make Huntress move at 120% and nobody would care.~~

###Freddy

Freddy doesn't have Haste but his power does Hinder basekit. But again outside of literally just Nothing but Misery I don't think this was ever stacked.

###Clown

The obvious victim of these changes as his power revolves entirely around Haste and Hinder. Ironically enough however **I don’t think Clown needs buffs.** His power is perfectly functional without stacking effects and I don’t doubt that Clown stacking with primarily Haste effects was a big reason for the change to Haste and Hinder. I do think Clown loses some build variety (primarily with both Game Afoot and Rapid Brutality) but these perks do still have use for Clown: you just can’t throw a yellow bottle at your feet to stack the speed boosts.

I do however think Behaviour should *MAYBE* and I mean ***MAYBE*** buff **Sticky Soda Bottle** and **Cheap Gin Bottle**. I don’t think these addons were used much in Haste stacking builds either but now that they can’t be I don’t think buffing them to 3% and 4% (1% increase to both) would substantially break anything. *Could* try 3% and 5%, but letting Clown move at 130% speed while slowing survivors down to 85% is actually scary.

###Legion

**BFFs**… How was this addon not buffed? This addon is literally **only** useful when stacked! The entire reason BFFs existed was for 10% Haste with NOED or 15% Haste with Batteries Included!

This addon needs to be buffed to 7% at *least* and ideally 10% or possibly even more! If you’re putting all your chips into the silly meme Endgame basket you should at least be rewarded for doing so!

Outrage aside: I will admit that buffing BFFs *too* heavily is risky since most BFFs enjoyers will just swap NOED out for Terminus. This along with the variety of strong endgame perks that now exist (No Way Out, Remember Me, None Are Free) would make a hypothetical 130% (15% BFFs) Legion very scary. I think 10% is a good starting point for a BFFs buff as that’s the same speed that could be obtained with either NOED or Batteries Included (well Batteries put you at 11% but who’s counting). Yes you can’t reach a hypothetical 15% Haste with Batteries, NOED, and BFFs anymore but I think that’s reasonable.

~~Oh and Mural Sketch doesn’t count as Haste, so Unbound Legion got buffed woo!~~

###Ghostface

I only mention Ghostie because his **Drop-Leg Knife Sheath** addon *isn’t a Haste addon???* I’m just genuinely wondering if this is a typo. Other killers had addons that seemed like they should be Haste but weren’t (example: Spirit’s Katana Tsuba) but Ghostface is the weirdest one since he has no basekit Haste.

###Trickster

Trickster’s **Iridescent Photocard** provides him with 7% Haste for hitting 7 knives. On the one hand I can see this addon being used in Haste stacking builds for a funny fast k-pop man. On the other hand… we know a Trickster rework is coming and I have legit never seen this addon be used.

I mean idk you could buff it to 8% or even 9% I guess. 10% gets a little scary (ranged 125% killer yikers) but it would maybe be wasted development time. Depends how hard it is to change a 7 to an 8 (I am genuinely not trying to be condescending here: due to how Iri Photo is based on hitting knives it genuinely might be hard to code this addon to work with 8 knives).

###Nemesis

I mean he does have a Hinder? I guess a survivor could get hit while dropping a pallet and then run away and get affected by Knockout? …Was anyone running Knockout on Nemesis? As mentioned earlier Knockout doesn’t work if you break the pallet. Nemesis is fine.

###Pinhead

Pinhead does not actually inflict Hinder: he just forces your survivor to walk. This is why Fixated made you faster while chained. I just felt this an interesting fact to mention.

###Artist

Artist’s **Untitled Agony** addon inflicts a 15% Hinder, which is more than any perk except Forced Hesitation. I am also like 70% sure that “Untitled Agony” is still bugged and only works if a survivor runs into a crow, not if you shoot it at them. Regardless this addon is fine (but obviously should be bugfixed if it doesn’t work as intended).

###Sadako

Sadako has the **Telephone** addon that inflicts survivors with 3% Hinder for 3 seconds if Sadako manifests (unphases) within 7 meters of them. Outside of showing off Sadako’s addiction to the number 7 this addon is laughably bad: 3% Hinder for 3 seconds does next to nothing.

The thing is the activation condition for this addon is so piss-easy that any buffs to it would give Sadako mini Clown bottles whenever she uses her power on top of all her other strengths. This addon just needs a complete rework: there’s no way to make its current effect balanced.

###Wesker

Wesker inflicts Hinder if a survivor is at max infection. This could hypothetically stack with Knockout or Nothing but Misery. Nobody is trying to stack Hinder on Wesker, and Wesker’s Hinder was specifically nerfed because it was unfun to receive a random Hinder because a Wesker chased you for 10 minutes. This does not need changes.

###Knight

Knight gets 5% Haste based on the distance he makes for his guards, and I don’t think anyone was trying to stack this? I mean yes you could hypothetically 10% faster by activating Unbound, summoning a guard, and then vaulting a window… but was anyone doing this? The only real loss I can see from removing Haste stacking from The Knight is that he can’t move 9% faster in the endgame with NOED, but again I don’t think anyone was doing this? Knight’s fine I think.

###Skull Merchant

Lol.

Look I’m not even going to bother suggesting buffs to current Skull Merchant: we know she was intentionally made weak because survivor mains cried too much. We know that she’s going to be reworked entirely soon™. There is no point in me suggesting buffs to her.

###Singularity

Singularity is probably the second biggest loser with the Haste nerfs as he loses his synergy with Rapid Brutality… Well not entirely I guess: Rapid provides 5% Haste and Larry’s base Haste from Overclock is 3%, so that’s technically a 2% difference.

Despite everything I think Larry is *mostly* fine. While he lost Rapid Brutality he did gain Unbound which is actually a very good perk to counter hugging windows, which is one of the main ways to counter Larry at a high level. I don’t know if Unbound will be meta on Larry nor if it’ll be better than Bamboozle, but I think he will largely be fine since he’s already a very strong killer.

Oh **Soma Family Photo** inflicts a 3% Hinder? …Does anyone actually care? I mean maybe some stacking problems with Knockout, but really SFP should be reworked entirely imo: the only reason the addon exists is to inflict Deep Wound on injured survivors to bypass their Off The Record and tunnel them.

###Xenomorph

Oh no **Parker’s Headband** doesn’t stack! …Yeah ain’t nobody stacking this dawg. You could make it last 5 seconds I guess? But not because of the stacking: rather because Parker’s Headband is kinda ass.

###Unknown

Unknown does technically inflict Hindered for 3 seconds (5 with **Notebook of Theories**) on a Direct Hit… was anyone running Knockout on Unknown? I doubt this needs buffs.

###Lich

**Boots of Speed** gives 5% Haste for 2 seconds. These could be buffed not because they got weaker with Haste stacking, but because 2 seconds of moving at 120% speed is kinda ass.

###Dracula

Dracula got shadow nerfed quite heavily by this Haste / Hinder change because the scent orbs that spawn in wolf form give 5% Haste. This no longer stacks with many Haste perks that Dracula could actually realistically use such as Furtive Chase, Rapid Brutality, and even more memey perks like Batteries Included or Shadowborn. Because of Dracula’s incredible mobility with bat form he could get close to survivors with the Haste from these perks and then chase them in wolf form, at which point the stacking with other Haste perks would allow him to get hits in unique ways.

However like I stated: most of these perks like Batteries Included either *should* be buffed or already *are* buffed in the case of Furtive Chase. I don’t think Dracula should receive a basekit buff and rather the perks that enabled this Haste Stacking playstyle should receive a buff instead to make them more viable in all builds. Dracula without Haste stacking was already strong enough, ergo he would still be strong if these Haste stacking builds were removed. Especially if (hypothetically) instead of moving 5% + 5% faster with Batteries Included, he was moving 10% + 0% faster with Batteries Included. Last time I checked 5 + 5 and 10 + 0 are the same thing.

###Houndmaster

Houndmaster inflicts a 10% Hinder on grab and a 10% Hinder for 5 seconds if the survivor escapes from her dog. The literal only situation I could see this being a problem is if a survivor stuns the dog and then run away from a pallet with Knockout, at which point the Houndmaster would only be slowing the survivor by 10% instead of 15%. But again: Knockout has such a short duration I doubt this matters.

~~The speed you get from following the dog’s path doesn’t count as Haste.~~

###Kaneki

So like, Kaneki inflicts 50% Hindered for half a second if he grabs a marked survivor (1 second if he vaults)? For some fucking reason? Genuinely why is this a mechanic??? Anyways 50% Hinder is goddamn gigantic and it only lasts for a second, so no this doesn’t need to stack.

As for **Torture Apparatus** this addon is honestly terrible: 6 seconds of moving at 120% speed when you’re in your weakened state will get you a hit in maybe 1 out of 100 games. Could be buffed to 10% and nobody would care; could be buffed to 10 seconds and nobody would care. This killer has way more busted addons.",3,1744904667.0,deadbydaylight,1,1.0,False

Installed the PTB primarily to check out the Haste and Hinder changes, but I also figured I’d check out Orela, her cosmetics, and her lore. I noticed a few things that I don’t think many people mentioned, so I’m going to go down her cosmetics from Brown to Purple to mention some of the interesting tidbits I noticed. However before that I’d like to give a cliffnotes version of her lore:

#Lore

* We have a very direct location for where Orela grew up and was consequently taken from. She grew up in “on Chicago’s far North Side in Roger’s Park, just blocks from Lake Michigan.” Roger’s Park is a real location! And while we don’t get an exact location it’s not overly difficult to pinpoint hypothetical areas where Orela could’ve lived.

* Her dad was a firefighter and her mom was a nurse.

* Orela majored in “hospitality.” This is not a typo: it is later stated she attended “restaurant management class.”

* Orela met her best friend Emily in her freshman year at Lakehead University, which is located in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. Emily is stated to have helped her transition.

* Emily was a fan of Sable’s podcast “All Things Wicked” (omg Dead by Daylight reference?) and listened to it with Orela. The podcast **is specified to be “old”, implying that Orela’s timeline happened well after Sable’s, but does exist in the same universe as Sable** and by proxy Mikaela.

* They specify that the podcast talked about the horror writer Cliff Barra and how many of his movies were turned into movies **specifically in the 1950s.** ~~Worth noting that The Casting of Frank Stone takes place (partially) in 1963: just felt relevant to mention since Frank Stone also has a heavy lore focus on filmmaking as a plot point.~~ They also mention the art director Alex Damaro, a war veteran who worked on set and costume design for Barra’s movies.

* Cliff Barra is an **existing lore character** featuring as a main side character in tome 10 (The Observer: Things in the Fog; Chamber of Blood. Dejavuism.) and having a passing mention in tome 19 (House of Arkham; Arcus 10 190). Alex Damaro is also mentioned in Tome 10 as being taken by The Entity, to which Cliff spends the rest of his life searching for Alex. The story in tome 10 concludes with Barra taking Damaro’s place as a killer and losing his memory, as Alex is turned into a survivor instead of a killer. However the ending is intentionally left vague: the story is essentially presented as a campfire story with a lot of speculation on what happened to Barra and Damaro.

* Alex Damaro is only mentioned in tome 10, but he may possibly have a passing name drop in the 2022 Twisted Masquerade tome. The first name “Alex” is mentioned, and we know that Alex Damaro is a survivor. We are also not aware of any other lore character named Alex. The Wiki notes that “It is unknown if (Alex Damaro) is the same Alex referenced in Alex's Toolbox”, however that is a realistic possibility in my opinion given Alex’s work creating complex sets for movies.

> (Thanks to the Dead by Daylight Wiki for archiving much of this information!)

* Orela and Emily liked to spend time together at the “Hard Boiled Café”, a coffee shop + bookstore with a “1950s mystery theme.” **This draws a lot of similarities to Mikaela and Sable** working at the Moonstone Café. It’s mentioned that Orela and Emily wanted to create a horror-themed restaurant inspired by Cliff Barra’s work.

* As a test run of their horror restaurant idea, Orela and Emily made a haunted house in an empty college dorm, said to be directly inspired by Barra’s work. Emily was hooked up to a fake electro-shock therapy table: **this seems to heavily imply that Barra wrote about The Doctor in one of his books.** It is unclear if The Doctor’s storyline (and by proxy the storyline of The Dredge, Haddie Kaur, and Nicholas Cage ~~yes Nic Cage indirectly has ties to The Doctor and The Dredge~~) existed in the same timeline as Mikaela and Sable, or if this is an instance of Cliff Barra seeing into alternate realities in the same way Mikaela has been shown to do in the lore.

* Regardless, Orela’s friend Emily dies to accidental electrocution from the fake electro-shock therapy table. Excluding the obvious similarities to Doctor’s Mori, this event is also referenced rather directly in Recording 3 for Orela’s teasers. You can hear Orela talk about how when treating a girl who was electrocuted “all I saw was you” about 32 seconds into her third recording.

* Emily dying to electrocution is what prompted Orela to become an EMT. It’s said she dropped out of college “the very next day” and that she had “a natural talent for soothing people”, which is reflected in her perk design.

* Orela saved the life of a wealthy man named Jon Kingsley. This character has not been mentioned anywhere prior in Dead by Daylight, at least to my knowledge. Regardless Orela is directly cited as being the reason Kingsley survived, and he used his wealth to fund Orela (and Emily)’s dream of opening a horror themed restaurant on “900 Blud Lane” across from a cemetery. 900 Blud Lane is not a real location.

* Regardless, this location would be known as “Screams in the Dark”, which is referenced in Orela’s second recording. It is stated she’d open it for one weekend every month with a different theme every time, and that it was very popular. Even so Orela didn’t make any moves to open the location for longer, as she focused primarily on her EMT work. It seems that the theming was primarily based on the work of Cliff Barra and Alex Damaro.

* Orela once themed Screams in the Dark around a story written by Barra about “a mysterious fog that transported victims to another dimensions.” **This is obviously a reference to The Entity and how it takes its victims. This fog is also referenced in Tome 10 (the tome that references both Barra and Damaro) as being Cliff’s primary obsession for finding and saving Alex, eventually taking Alex’s place as a killer.**

* It is stated that “some believed the words in the story were cursed and somehow made readers disappear”, implying that Barra’s writing somehow exists as a gateway into The Entity’s realm. This can also be seen in how Alan Wake writes himself into The Entity’s realm. ~~Going to quickly throw a theory that Cliff Barra may possibly be an alternate universe version of Alan Wake? I find this very unlikely.~~

* Anyways turns out the rumors were true: Orela heard Emily’s voice in the simulated fog she created for Screams in the Dark, and went into the Fog looking for her friend. **It is hypothetically possible that Emily is “alive” in The Entity’s realm** as we have seen other “dead” characters like Amanda Young (The Pig), Detective David Tapp, and Bill Overbeck be taken into The Realm. This could also be The Entity manipulating Orela as we have similarly seen it capable of doing that to characters like Chucky (simulated an illusion of Andy) and The Houndmaster (took Mad Molak ~~pirate king who killed her father~~ from her and made her chase after him into the fog. >!HEAVILY implied that most of The Houndmaster’s lore was an illusion conjured by The Entity, but that’s another lore discussion entirely!<).

###tl;dr

* Orela grew up in the real-life location of Roger's Park, Chicago.

* Orela met her best friend Emily in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. Emily got Orela into horror and helped her transition.

* Emily and Orela listened to Sable's podcast ""All Things Wicked"". Sable's podcast is **specified to be old**, implying a degree of time separation between Orela and Sable. They do however **exist in the same universe.**

* Sable primarily talked about the works of Cliff Barra and Alex Damaro on her podcast. **These are previously mentioned tome lore characters said to have been taken by The Entity.** Cliff Barra is a horror writer who'd later have his books turned into movies with Alex Damaro working on set and costume design. Alex would be taken by The Entity and Cliff would obsess over Alex's disappearance before eventually entering The Entity's Realm. The story of Cliff and Alex concludes with Cliff becoming a killer and Alex becoming a survivor, however this is left intentionally vague. It is unclear if Alex Damaro is the Alex referenced in the item ""Alex's Toolbox"", but it is hypothetically possible.

* ~~It's somewhat noteworthy to mention that most of Cliff Barra's movies were made in the 1950s, and that The Casting of Frank Stone takes place (partially) in 1963.~~

* Orela's friend Emily died in a recreation of one of Barra's books that **had heavy resemblance to The Doctor's lore.** It is unclear if Barra knew of the events that happened to The Doctor or if this was a sighting of an alternate timeline, akin to what Mikaela has been shown to be able to do in the lore.

* Orela became an EMT after Emily died. She's said to have ""a natural talent for soothing people"" which is reflected in her perks.

* Orela saved the life of a wealthy businessman (no lore relevance) who helped her open up ""Screams in the Dark"", a horror-themed restaurant that would be open once a month with themeing based on the works of Cliff Barra and Alex Damaro.

* Orela ran an event at Screams in the Dark based on a supposed ""cursed story"" by Cliff Barra. This story is **very clearly based on The Entity.** When on the set for this event she heard Emily crying for help in The Fog, and went in to save her. This is how she was taken. **It is unclear if Emily is “alive” in The Fog or if it was just an illusion.**

Orela’s lore draws a lot of thematic similarities to other survivors, with themes of the power of writing (Mikalea, Alan Wake) and movies (Sable, Nic Cage) invoking The Entity, and the concept of the supposed DbD multiverse and the idea of parallel timelines (Haddie). It also **directly establishes Sable Ward** as a character that is **known by Orela**, however Orela specifically knows Sable through **”old” podcasts, implying a great degree of time separation between her and Sable.**

Orela’s lore notably presents the character of **Cliff Barra** as a major lore character who seems to have similar powers to Mikaela and accidentally managed to invoke The Entity with his writing and later movies based on his writing. Cursed movies based on Barra’s works may be what caused the disappearances at the Greenville Theatre which later resulted in Sable being taken. Barra is implied to be a killer, while his supposed survivor counterpart would be Alex Damaro, potentially the Alex referenced by “Alex’s Toolbox”.

#Cosmetics

I am only going to be going over either major lore relevant mentions in the cosmetics or things that I found particularly odd. While there are many small lore snapshots in the cosmetics, I am not going to go over every small bit of information such as “Orela once attended a wedding” (Black and White Blazer) or “Orela liked living in Chicago” (brown recolors).

###Common

**Default Torso** - Two things:

1. Her default cosmetic is wearing a “Screams in the Dark” tee-shirt underneath her blazer: this is the restaurant she opened with money from saving Jon Kingsley’s life.

2. Orela’s default cosmetic makes direct reference to the event at the end of her lore, and how “Alone in the night, she heard Emily calling to her from within the fog.” Her entire default set (head, torso, and legs) references this event.

**Recolored Outfits** - Strangely, all her common rarity recolored outfits have unique names. To my knowledge the only other survivor to do this is Jane Romero. Most other survivors follow a generalized pattern for their recolors of “(Flavor Word) (Word related to their backstory)”, such as Zarina’s recolors being referred to as “Corruption Reporter”, “Undercover Reporter”, and “Watchdog Reporter” respectively.

>Not all brown rarity cosmetics have the same wording but they do generally follow this style >!(Zarina’s 4th recolor is referred to as “Opinion Sampler”, and Jeff’s cosmetics are referred to as “Bohemian Sketcher”, “Edgy Oil Painter”, “Rogue Illustrator”, and “Rugged Digital Artist” respectively)!< Jane and Orela are the only two survivors to have wholly unique names for their cosmetics, although Orela’s brown cosmetics do follow a generalized pattern of “(Color) (Environmental Object)”

###Uncommon

**All (green?) Recolors** - Her (green, I guess) recolors are referred to as “Bank Meeting”, “Investor Meeting”, and “Lawyer Meeting” and all have the description of Orela not being used to signing paperwork. These are likely references to her transition.

###Rare

**Scuffed-Up Shorts (Prestige Legs)** - These have a substantially different description from her default legs, while her default head and torso have slightly altered versions of her default cosmetic descriptions. Her Prestige Legs read “The world changed around her, and she knew things would never be the same.” This seems to imply that at least to some extent Orela knew what she was getting into when she walked into The Fog. However this is a Prestige cosmetic (expressly obtained while in The Realm) so the canonicity of this cosmetic is unclear.

**Day Shift / Night Shift** - The description of Orela’s (blue?) rarity cosmetics both reference her saving Jon Kingsley. The variation in the names of these cosmetics is minimal, although I do find it amusing that the “Day Shift” hair is referred to as “Azure Sky” while the “Night Shift"" hair is referred to as “Twilight Sky”. Additionally, Orela has a sticker of a heart and a saxophone on her EMT jacket, which I find cute.

###Very Rare

**Halcyon Dreams / Nostalgic Dreams**

>First of all: the word “halcyon” (hal·cy·on – /ˈhalsēən/) is defined by Google as “denoting a period of time in the past that was idyllically happy and peaceful.” Christ BHVR pulling out the thesaurus when naming their cosmetics.

These sets seem to be from when Orela was studying to be a hostess and met Emily. This is referenced rather directly in the set description: “Life at university changed when she was paired with Emily for a class project.” The rest of the cosmetics describe the two of them buying new clothes for Orela after her transition, and how they were best of friends until Emily’s unfortunate death.

**Classic Knot / Pale Knot** - The torso for her Very Rare outfit features an All Things Wicked shirt under her overshirt. Along with being a reference to Sable (obviously) this makes sense if we consider this set to be a reference to Orela’s time in university when Emily first introduced her to Sable’s podcast.",2,1744904616.0,deadbydaylight,0,0.75,False

I think it is because I am mediocre looking (even though people around me tell that I am handsome) but when I strike a conversation with someone I can have their attention. This year, I approached a girl that was in the same queue as I was in a coffee shop (near my uni), I said that we are in the same queue, what coffee did you get? And then I complimented her hair. When I asked for her number, she said I have a boyfriend. Later though she said I was polite when I said no problem. So I understood this as ""I would accept if I was single"". But now I am scared that all the girls I approach will have a boyfriend and it will reduce my confidence. So should I push myself to approach people I like or should I just wait?

1k1fylr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1k1fylr/confession/,Confession,"I went to confession today and it wasn’t very spiritually enlightening for me. I was hoping for forgiveness and guidance but what I received was a platitude—‘be the best person you can be’. 

I sin every day—venial sins—but sins nonetheless. The biggest ones that weigh on my conscious are related to how every time I consume—buying a shirt, or a cup of coffee, or a chocolate bar—I know I am contributing to exploitation of children, slave labor, unjust labor conditions, environmental destruction. I make these consumption choices willingly and I know the impact I have, even if I am not directly or even intentionally exploiting. By being part of the system, I exploit others, I am stealing, I am not centering God in my life. I don’t know how to reconcile this and it weighs heavily on me. I also am (potentially even more) afraid of the slippery slope of ignoring this, shrugging it off, as many do, but I grow tired and often lose hope thinking of the magnitude of the problem and how I am but a small cog in the machine. But I also know that I need self care, that I can’t take on all the world’s problems. 

I want to center God in my life, but “being the best person I can be” isn’t enough. Though my sins are forgiven, I feel as lost as I did before entering the confessional.  ",1,1744904608.0,Catholicism,3,0.67,False

1k1fw3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1k1fw3q/what_makes_the_antarctic_star_z5815snh_ice_maker/,What makes the Antarctic Star Z5815SNH ice maker a top-rated review?,"The Antarctic Star Z5815SNH-BLACK-AS3 Nugget Countertop Ice Maker has been my go-to appliance for a couple of weeks now, and I’ve got a lot to share about it. It’s been running almost daily in my kitchen, churning out chewable pellet ice like a tiny, hardworking factory. With summer in full swing, I’ve been hosting friends for iced coffees, cocktails, and chilled lemonades—this little ice maker has definitely pulled its weight. But it's not all perfection; there's a few quirks too.

**Design and Build Quality**

This countertop ice maker is compact without feeling flimsy. Measuring just 11.81""D x 9.06""W x 12.99""H, it fits snugly next to my coffee maker without dominating my small countertop. Despite its small size, it doesn’t skimp on style. The black stainless steel finish gives it a sleek, modern look, and it doesn’t scream ""appliance!"" like some other clunky ice makers. The transparent lid is a thoughtful addition—it lets me peek in to check the ice-making process without opening and disrupting it. Plus, it’s lightweight at 18.7 pounds, meaning I’ve moved it between the kitchen and my bar area when needed, without breaking a sweat.

[Check Antarctic Star Z5815SNH-BLACK-AS3 price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0d4tpplsy/)

**Performance and Features**  

What genuinely surprised me was how quickly this machine produces ice. With just 1.1 liters of water in the tank, I get 34 pounds of nugget ice in 24 hours. I threw a backyard party last week, and all day long, it made enough ice to keep every drink frosty. The chewable nugget ice isn’t just quick, it also has a texture that’s miles ahead of hard block ice. My niece, who has braces, called it ""the best ice for crunching"" and stayed near the cooler munching on it all afternoon.

Navigating this ice maker is straightforward. With just one button, even my less tech-savvy dad figured it out immediately. Kudos to the indicator lights that alert you when it’s low on water or when the ice basket is full. It’s a subtle convenience, but when you’re handling drinks for guests, it feels like the little things matter. Another mention-worthy feature is the self-cleaning mode. Holding the ""ICE/CLEAN"" button for five seconds sets off a 15-minute cleaning cycle. The fewer chores I have to do, the better!

**Positives**

14. Favorable Aspects  
- Produces up to 34 pounds of chewable nugget ice daily.  
- Quiet operation, even when it's actively making ice.  
- Small footprint with a design that suits kitchen counters, bars, or outdoor settings.  
- Transparent lid for easy monitoring of the ice-making process.  

**Negatives**

19. Less Favorable Aspects  
- The capacity of 1.1 liters works fine for personal use but might require frequent refilling during large events.  
- Annoyingly, the scoop holder feels a bit cheap and flimsy compared to the overall build.

**Product Competitors**

When considering other options on the market, the Antarctic Star ice maker does face some stiff competition. Take the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker, for instance. It's incredibly well-rated and produces a similar style of nugget ice beloved for its chewable texture. However, the GE Opal is bulkier and considerably more expensive. Where the Antarctic Star shines is portability—it’s much lighter and takes up less counter space. Another contender would be the Igloo ICEB26HNSS ice maker, which has similar dimensions but doesn’t quite match up in terms of ice production speed. The Antarctic Star balances affordability and efficiency without compromising too much on feature set.

**Financial Value**

15. Budget Friendly  
I’d describe this product as a bang-for-your-buck appliance. It doesn’t cost an arm and a leg, especially compared to premium competitors, and it delivers consistent performance without over-complicating things. The self-cleaning function and low water consumption add to its value, saving you time and effort. If you’re someone who loves hosting or just enjoys good ice for your drinks, the modest price tag feels justified without any lingering buyer’s remorse.

# Key Takeaways

* **Why Small Towns?** Lower costs, less competition, and strong community ties make them ideal for startups.
* **Finding Opportunities**: Identify unmet local needs to create profitable businesses.
* **Keys to Success**: Build community connections, stay adaptable, and keep costs low.
* **Modern Business Models**: Specialty food shops, mobile services, and multi-purpose venues thrive with digital tools.
* **Telehealth Growth**: Virtual healthcare meets rural needs with low overhead and high demand.
* **Getting Started**: Research market gaps, assess skills, and explore digital-first solutions.

# Understanding Small Town Business Opportunities

Small towns are perfect breeding grounds for entrepreneurs who want to build meaningful businesses that last. Rural communities' tight-knit nature creates a supportive environment where new ventures can thrive when entrepreneurs understand local dynamics and take the right approach.

# Why small towns are perfect for new entrepreneurs

Starting a business in a rural area comes with clear advantages over city locations. [Lower overhead costs](https://bask.health/blog/Proven-telemedicine-business-models) are a huge plus, with cheaper real estate, lower operating expenses, and reduced startup costs. Small town entrepreneurs also face less competition and enjoy stronger community support that turns into loyal customers.

Rural businesses tend to be more profitable than their city counterparts. They show an average profit margin of 56% compared to 53% for urban businesses. These small businesses are vital to local economies and create jobs that reduce unemployment as they grow.

# Identifying gaps in local markets

Success in small towns comes from finding what economists call ""market gaps""—products or services that make residents drive to other towns. This concept, known as ""[sales gap analysis](https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/gap-analysis-as-a-tool-for-community-economic-development.html),"" helps you spot opportunities where money leaves the local economy.

Here's how to research your market effectively:

* Walk around town and note missing services or products
* Ask residents what they wish they could buy locally
* Look at nearby competitors' strengths and weaknesses
* Study industry trends that matter to your community

The Small Business Administration suggests combining consumer behavior analysis with economic trends to verify your business concept. This helps you find your potential market share and the customers who will boost your profits.

# Balancing community needs with profitability

Small businesses that succeed in rural areas understand how company success and community well-being work together. Studies show that when businesses feel supported by their community, they feel more responsible toward it.

Successful small-town entrepreneurs look beyond just making money. They know they help shape their community's identity. These businesses become part of the town's character by joining local events, supporting other businesses, and solving real local problems.

Bask Health's digital health solutions show this balance in action. They meet crucial healthcare needs in underserved communities while staying profitable through virtual services that keep costs low.

# Essential Qualities of Successful Small Town Businesses

Small-town businesses need specific qualities to succeed compared to their urban counterparts. These unique characteristics help create lasting ventures that become cornerstones of rural communities.

# Community connection and local support

Small-town business owners run their operations just like they live—with care, diligence, and trust in their regular customers. They understand how their actions affect the entire community. A mutual relationship develops naturally, as businesses treat clients like family members and communities stand by these establishments during tough times.

This support network proved crucial during the pandemic. Local establishments kept their prices steady so community members could keep shopping with them. Research shows that [86% of small businesses](https://www.goldmansachs.com/community-impact/10000-small-businesses/us/news-and-program-information/investing-in-small-businesses-across-rural-communities) in rural communities plan to grow, yet only 7% feel they get enough private sector support.

# Adaptable business models for rural markets

Rural businesses thrive through adaptability by using:

* Shared resources and multi-purpose spaces (commercial kitchens, co-working facilities)
* Mobile services that reach customers beyond a single location
* Digital options letting professionals help clients remotely
* Strategic collaborations that benefit multiple businesses

Yes, it is remarkable how many communities have found creative ways to keep their small-town values and historic character while building a thriving economy. Bask Health shows this adaptable approach by offering telehealth services that connect rural residents with healthcare at lower operating costs.

# Low overhead with maximum effect

Rural businesses excel at creating big results with minimal costs. Numbers show that [74% of rural small businesses report revenue growth](https://icic.org/blog/empowering-rural-small-businesses/) after implementing budget-friendly strategies. They achieve this through creative ownership structures—including cooperatives, community ownership, and employee-owned models—that share risk and investment.

Better rural broadband access creates new possibilities for digital business models. Uninterrupted connectivity helps local workforces through educational access, links rural businesses to wider markets, and helps entrepreneurs use technological resources better.

The most successful small-town businesses blend community connection, adaptability, and resource efficiency to create lasting value beyond just profits.

# Top Traditional Business Ideas with Modern Twists

Small towns breathe new life into traditional businesses through smart digital upgrades and fresh service approaches. Smart entrepreneurs create successful local enterprises by blending old-school wisdom with modern methods.

# Specialty food shops with online ordering

Small-town specialty food stores now reach beyond their physical walls with e-commerce features. These businesses serve both locals and far-away customers who search for special products.

Agricultural areas see great success with farmers market-style stores that stock local produce and seasonal items. These stores attract both residents and tourists. Towns that already have big chain grocery stores create perfect spots to fill niche markets. They can focus on organic, local, gluten-free, or vegan options that bigger stores tend to skip.

These steps help create the biggest results while keeping inventory costs low:

* Shape your store around local products and your community's priorities
* Set up online ordering with local delivery or shipping choices
* Team up with nearby producers to keep products fresh and support your community

Small towns value customized service, and specialty food stores run on this principle. The Arts Emporium/Essenhaus shows this beautifully. They turned an old saloon into a lively food spot that offers live music and dinner theater, among other culinary delights.

# Mobile services that come to customers

Mobile businesses break down distance barriers by bringing their services right to rural customers' doorsteps. Food trucks are a great example—they're now a $2 billion-plus industry that costs nowhere near as much to run as regular restaurants.

Mobile businesses can adapt quickly—they serve multiple towns, show up at community events, and adjust to seasonal patterns. This approach works great for:

* Food services (trucks, mobile coffee shops)
* Pet grooming and veterinary care
* Home cleaning and maintenance
* Photography services

# Multi-purpose venues for community gathering

Community hubs can switch from music venues to church services to business meetings all in one week. These spaces usually come equipped with stages, sound systems, projectors, kitchens, and flexible seating.

Small towns get several benefits from these spaces:

* They cost less than building separate facilities
* They bring different community groups together
* They create closer connections than big city venues
* They help local businesses and organizations through events

Morgan Hill Community & Cultural Center shows this idea at its best. Their multi-purpose rooms, classrooms, meeting spaces, garden, kitchen, and outdoor amphitheater give the community amazing value from one investment.

These business models show how classic ideas can grow to meet today's needs while keeping the close community ties that make small towns special.



# Bask Health's Digital Solutions for Small Town Entrepreneurs

Telehealth has become a game-changer for entrepreneurs in small towns, and [virtual healthcare visits](https://bask.health/blog/telemedicine-solutions) have jumped by 400% since 2020. This digital solution helps around 30 million Americans who live in healthcare deserts where doctors are hard to find.

# How telehealth businesses serve rural communities

People in rural areas face unique challenges with their healthcare. They don't have enough providers, must travel long distances, and watch their local hospitals close down. On top of that, many patients avoid getting help for sensitive health issues because they worry about privacy and what others might think. Telehealth solves these problems by connecting patients with specialists online so they can get diagnosed and treated without traveling far.

The telemedicine industry has grown rapidly. It's now [worth about $90 billion in 2023](https://bask.health/blog/how-to-start-a-telehealth-business-bask-2024) and should reach $200 billion by 2028. This growth creates great opportunities for small-town entrepreneurs who don't need much overhead to get started.

# Starting a telehealth business with Bask Health

Bask Health makes it easy to launch a telehealth practice by building many business essentials right into their platform. We focused on:

* Market research to find your niche (mental health, chronic disease management, etc.)
* Marketing and getting new customers
* Building trust and connections in your community

The platform takes care of the complex parts of telehealth—provider networks, compliance, and technology infrastructure. This makes it available to people who don't have much healthcare experience.

# Benefits of a virtual healthcare model in small towns

A Bask Health telehealth business gives small-town entrepreneurs unique advantages. You need nowhere near as much money as traditional healthcare practices because you don't need a physical office. You also provide services that communities really need, especially where specialized care is missing. As more people choose [remote consultations](https://bask.health/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-telehealth) over in-person visits, telehealth businesses are set up for future success.

Rural patients spend less time away from work, save money on travel, and can see specialists who might be hours away. Entrepreneurs can grow their business across multiple communities while helping people who need it in their area.

Starting a small town business needs a good balance between what the community needs and making enough money to stay afloat. Our team at Bask Health has seen how [digital solutions](https://bask.health/blog/digital-health-software-solutions) create chances for small town entrepreneurs. They can make real changes without spending too much money upfront.

Your hometown business has clear advantages compared to city ventures. Local businesses face less competition and build stronger community bonds naturally. Running costs are lower than in cities. Best of all, you'll solve real problems that big companies don't deal very well with.

Here's what you need to do next:

* Conduct thorough market research by asking locals what services make them travel to other places
* Review your skills and interests to spot business ideas that tap into your strengths
* Connect with community leaders who can explain development priorities and available resources
* Explore digital-first models that need less physical space but reach more people

I booked one because it has a separate bedroom for our family of 4. It looked nice on the app, but it was a different story when I actually checked in. 

The ""deluxe suite"" is just a regular suite that's handicap accessible. The sofabed bedding and kitchen utensils were missing, and it took two trips to the front desk to get it all. 

The whole build quality is just chintzy - cooktop is too small for the cookware, microwave is an Aldi special, coffee pot is missing filters. Walls and doors are made of cardboard. It doesn't look anything like the website. I paid $120/night so it's whatever, but this is really disappointing.",3,1744904102.0,Hilton,3,0.8,False

I’m a student, and recently I’ve been really overwhelmed with exams. A friend recommended an astrology app, saying their readings helped him think through some life decisions. I’m not sure if he paid for a subscription or just used the free features, but I thought it might be a nice distraction from studying, so I signed up for a free trial. They asked for my card details to verify, and I figured it was safe.  
But a week later, I saw a $39.99 charge on my account. It turns out the trial automatically turned into a paid subscription, and I didn’t notice the terms. I tried to cancel right away, but the interface was hard to use, and even after I thought I canceled, another charge came through. I’ve emailed their support three times and even tried to find a phone number to call, but all I’ve gotten are automated replies saying they’ll get back to me soon. It’s been two weeks, and still nothing.  
Also, the readings I got during the trial were not very helpful - just generic advice I could’ve found online for free. Now I’m out $100, which is half my monthly food budget. I’ve had to skip coffee with friends and buy only the cheapest groceries to get by. I wish I hadn’t trusted my friend’s recommendation, and I feel like I should’ve been more careful—my parents always told me to be cautious with online services, but I didn’t listen.  
I called my bank, but they said disputing the charges could take weeks, and I’m not sure what to do next. Should I keep waiting for a response from support, or go ahead and dispute the charges through my bank? Has anyone had a similar experience with apps like this? How can I get my money back and avoid this happening again? And how do I check these kinds of services to make sure I don’t lose money in the future? I’m not sure I can trust my friends’ recommendations now. Thank you so much for any advice - I really need help to figure this out and feel more confident moving forward.",25,1744904073.0,internetparents,18,0.93,False

I live with my mum, but i go to my dad usually during summer for a week or two. Whenever I'm there, my step mum, Jane, always makes me watch my half sister, give her food, clean, get groceries, cook and so on. Whenever i can, i get my half sister and presents, and i even make presents for Jane, which I try to keep meaningful rather than expensive (like making smth nice abt her, sis and dad, excluding myself), presents that i give them during summer when im there. But, when it comes to my bday, i never even get a text from her. I dont expect a present or anything like that, but a call or at least a happy bday gif would be nice. When i graduated middle school she intentionally convinced my dad to go to the coffee shop, nearly missing the entire thing. I dont know, i kinda feel like a brat, but i wish she'd treat me a bit differently. I might just stop going there, i feel like im just very unwelcomed and i dont want to make them feel uncomfortable with me around.

1k1fo78,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k1fo78,"Horrendous Blood Panel - Dr. Seems unconcerned but I am: 168 LDL, 181 TG","Hi, i've been lurking here for a few weeks and am at a point where i felt compelled to post for some insights. My Health/fitness/diet background is below my write up about what is going on

Bloodwork taken 3/24/2025, reported 3/29/2025  (included screenshots of labs from 2019 and 2021:

37 y/o male, 5'4"" 140lb 11-12% bodyfat.

Total Chol: 263

HDL: 61

TG: 181

LDL: 168

Fasting Glucose: 103

A1c: 5.2

Doctor seemed unconcerned, said its probably , told me to cut my sugar and alcohol intake. I don't drink, and despite eating more sugar than i probably should have been, it didn't seem excessively high upon first look (from looking at tracking history)  but I'll accept i could have been doing better and have since made changes. Didn't want a re-test before a year, doesn't want to prescribe anything (Which could be good or bad), doesn't want to test ApoB or Lp(a), or fasting insulin.

Family history of high cholesterol, mother had open heart surgery for HOCM, father has 2 stents and has been on statins since 40's. I'm 'the healthy one' in the family, insofar as i am the only one isn't overweight or carrying a lot of extra body fat, only one that exercises, doesn't drink, doesn't eat like they have a death wish.. From reviewing my older labs, it seems like my LDL has always been on the higher side, but only now are my triglycerides through the roof. Also, the first time that I've ever had elevated glucose.

Upon my badgering the doctors office requesting a re-test as well as a test for ApoB and Lp(a), and fasting insulin but he says those are unnecessary. He agreed to have a scrip for a retest on CMP and Lipid profile for a month from now. I was willing and ready to pay for third party bloodwork to be done from something like Function Health, as i make changes to see how things manifest, but apparently NY/NJ has some law regarding labs that add hundreds of dollars in lab fees to get anything done via third party. Seems like some of the mail order labs people suggest in this subreddit cannot offer certain tests to NY as well. Very frustrating.

I've been driving myself kind of crazy with avoiding this and that and making changes. I know in the long run, none of the modifications i'm changing, like reducing sugar and saturated fat intake are bad, but blindly slashing random things from my diet while being dismissed by my doctor and not having any real plan for gauging progress makes me feel like i'm flying blind and i'm unsure if the changes i'm making are going to be any combination of effective or necessary. 



  
As of now, i'm weighing any or several of the following:

* Seeing a new doctor that is more concerned with preventative care regarding cardiovascular health.
* Waiting a month and re-testing the basic CMP and Lipid to see if changes I've made have had any effect.
* Paying out of pocket for ApoB and Lp(a) test from a lab directly
* Sucking it up and just paying the exorbinant lab fees associated with using function health or another third party while in NY.

I'm also curious what factors could have contributed to the jump in triglycerides and glucose level. Two friends who are doctors did question if i was **definitely** fasted. The night before the bloodwork (which was drawn at 7am), my schedule was a bit off and between 8-9:30pm ate a much larger and richer meal than i normally would have at that time. (this contained 643 calories, 31 total sugars, 7 added sugars, and 10 grams of saturated fat). I am not saying this would have thrown things off, but just including it in case its relevant.

**My Health/Fitness background:** I've been lifting weights and primarily concerned with strength training and maintaining a lean/muscular body composition for about 10-12 years. Up until receiving these results I've always been more of a Macro/calorie tracking person and genuinely not particularly concerned with other aspects of nutrition. 

**Things I have pretty much always done for the last several years including leading up to the recent bloodwork**

* The Good:
   * Lift weights
   * Maintained a low body fat %
   * No alcohol or smoking
   * relatively high step count despite having a desk job (8k min, often 10-12k, occasionally 15-18k)
   * Rarely if ever eat fatty cuts of steak - only lean ground beef (96%) lean ground chicken, chicken breast, lean cuts of steak, steelhead trout
   * little to no added butter or specific saturated fat sources added to food i cook
   * little to no specifically added sugar to food i cook
   * Rarely eat out
   * only use avocado or olive oil, and minimal amounts.
* The Bad:
   * Did not really look at added sugars in foods i was eating (averaged 15-25 depending on the day based on tracking history)
   * did not really consider saturated fat intake (averaged about high 20's based on tracking history)
   * minimal cardio outside of step count
* Neutral:
   * I use some supplements such as protein powder, (most of my protein comes from whole food), creatine, Zinc/magnesium.
   * I use artificial sweeteners (sacharin (sweet n low in coffee) and sucralose/aspartame are in a lot of diet beverages, which i have probably one or two a day of.

**Things i had been doing moreso in the months leading  up to the recent bloodwork**

* The good:
   * Increased fruit and vegetable intake
   * really good sleep quality
* The bad:
   * All of the same things as above
* Probably bad, recent additions in the months prior to bloodwork
   * Increased egg intake from rarely eating eggs to eating two eggs 5-6 days a week)
   * My wife started making sourdough and i would consume about 60-150g per day of sourdough  (30-60g carb 200-350 calories per day)

**Since Getting the bloodwork result:**

* The good:
   * Started monitoring added sugars and overall sugar intake to reduce these heavily.
      * more or less cut out or heavily slashed anything with added sugar
   * Started monitoring saturated fat intake to reduce this heavily
   * added specific higher heart rate cardio (zone 1/2)
   * pretty much stopped eating eggs (which i miss)
   * reduced sourdough bread intake (which i miss)
   * Started taking Viva Naturals Fish oil  omega 3 (1500EPA 568 DHA)
* Neutral?
   * Reduced fruit intake (which i miss) trying to keep overall sugar intake down.

# Key Takeaways

* **Family Businesses Drive Global Economies** – They generate 70% + of the world's GDP and employ 60% of the workforce.
* **Success Comes from Strong Foundations** – Shared values, clear roles, and flexible work arrangements help family businesses thrive.
* **Start Small, Grow Smart** – Home services, crafts, and local retail offer low-cost entry points for family entrepreneurs.
* **Digital Ventures Provide Flexibility** – E-commerce, content creation, and online education let families work together from anywhere.
* **Telehealth is a Growing Opportunity** – Platforms like Bask Health help family teams build scalable healthcare businesses.
* **Legacy Matters** – Lasting family businesses adapt while preserving values across generations.

# What Makes a Family Business Thrive

Family businesses show amazing staying power thanks to their unique qualities. These enterprises mix personal bonds with business goals, which creates special advantages that encourage lasting success.

# Shared values and vision

Strong family businesses build everything on shared principles that guide decisions. Research shows that companies with clearly expressed family values perform better and earn higher returns. These values act as a compass that points the business toward ""true north"" even in tough times.

Values drive decisions. When family members share similar beliefs, they create a unified culture that draws in employees and customers who think the same way. Research highlights [five key elements of successful family businesses](https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewerskine/2021/02/17/family-values-and-success-of-the-family-business/): family control, member identification with the business, strong social ties, emotional attachments, and bonds that renew across generations.

# Clear roles and responsibilities

Many family businesses run informally and rely on verbal agreements instead of defined roles. This approach often causes problems when disagreements pop up.

Successful family companies prevent conflict by:

* Writing formal employment agreements that spell out duties
* Setting clear performance metrics
* Giving responsibilities based on business needs, not family position
* Building proper governance with non-family advisors

# Flexible time commitments

Family businesses stand out because of their natural flexibility. Studies prove that family members who work in their family's business use [flexible work arrangements](https://bask.health/blog/telehealth-covid) more than people in regular jobs. This freedom helps balance work and life better and makes running your own business more appealing.

Bask Health puts this flexibility principle to work through its telehealth platform. Their family teams work together remotely while keeping their professional and personal lives in balance.

# Building a lasting legacy

Family businesses might be common, but only 30% survive to the second generation. Even fewer—just 3%—make it to the fourth generation. Building something that lasts takes real effort.

Legacy means more than passing down money. It passes values, purpose, and meaning from one generation to the next. The businesses that last for generations find ways to respect tradition while accepting new ideas.

Some family businesses thrive for centuries. Take Italian winemaker Marchesi Antinori, 637 years old. They prove that with good succession planning and strong governance, family businesses can flourish for hundreds of years.

Family businesses create organizations that last by mixing clear communication, defined roles, flexible arrangements, and careful legacy planning. These companies can weather economic storms and tech disruptions while staying true to who they are.

# Starting Small: Entry-Level Family Business Ideas

You don't need a huge amount of money to start a family business. Many success stories begin with small steps that let family members build their skills and grow their customer base over time.

# Home-based service businesses

[Service-based businesses](https://bask.health/blog/small-business-ideas) make great starting points for family teams. They cost little to start and can provide a steady income. Small towns with spacious yards create perfect opportunities for family-run lawn care and gardening services. These businesses run smoothly and can expand naturally.

Here are some promising options:

* **Cleaning services**—Any family member can pitch in since there's low overhead and no special education needed
* **Child and elder care**—This works well for families who love connecting with people and building community ties
* **Pet care services**— From walking dogs to grooming them, these services help [65.1 million American households with dogs](https://www.shopify.com/blog/family-business-ideas)

Pros: Small startup costs, flexible hours, easy to divide family roles

Cons: Physical work often needed, some services vary by season

# Creative and craft enterprises

Artistic families can turn their creative passions into money-making ventures. Home bakeries let you express creativity without spending much. Just create an appealing menu, get simple equipment, and build a social-first presence.

Your family's unique talents can shine through handmade items:

* Handcrafted jewelry, home décor, or personalized gifts
* Custom candles, pottery, or stationery
* Family content creation through vlogs or social media

Pros: Rewarding work, direct customer connections, shows off family creativity

Cons: Market research matters, tough competition, seasonal ups and downs

# Local retail opportunities

Modern retail offers fresh takes on traditional business models. A food truck makes a simpler choice than a full restaurant, and two people can run it. Farmers' markets give you a low-risk way to test retail waters.

Secondhand stores or thrift shops help communities while offering budget-friendly shopping. On top of that, [vending machines](https://bask.health/blog/business-to-start-with-10k) can create passive income after your first investment.

* Pros: Real products, community involvement, room to grow
* Cons: Higher startup costs, inventory management takes work

# Digital Ventures for Modern Family Teams

The digital economy opens up remarkable chances for family teams to build businesses without extensive physical infrastructure. Online ventures provide the perfect mix of flexibility and the ability to grow that modern families need.

# E-commerce and dropshipping

E-commerce has become a thriving industry. Online sales topped $1.00 trillion in 2022 and will make up 25% of global retail by 2026. Dropshipping stands out as an available starting point for family teams.

Bean & Bean, a family-run coffee subscription business, shows what's possible through this model. Mother-daughter team Rachel and Jiyoon Han run four physical stores and sell coffee, teas, and gifts online successfully.

* Pros: International reach, minimal startup costs, 24/7 sales potential, location-independent operations
* Cons: High competition, technology challenges, shipping logistics, unpredictable income

This business model suits travel-loving families perfectly. Teams can run operations from home or while seeing the world together.

# Content creation and social media management

Family members can tap into their collective creativity and build a personal brand by creating content on YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram. Young family members can learn about governance work through a social media policy.

Authentic storytelling sets family businesses apart. Your family's story of wins and challenges builds trust and creates real connections with your audience.

* Pros: Minimal startup costs, creative expression, diverse skill utilization
* Cons: Requires consistent content production, platform algorithm changes

# Online education and consulting

Families with expert knowledge can create and sell [digital products](https://bask.health/blog/solopreneur-business-ideas) such as online courses, coaching services, or consulting packages. The global eLearning market will grow 5% yearly and exceed $325 billion by 2025.

Bask Health shows how family teams can build telehealth practices together. This model works great for families with healthcare backgrounds, wellness expertise, or coaching experience.

* Pros: Makes use of family expertise, flexible digital products, flexible scheduling
* Cons: Requires subject matter expertise, competitive marketplace

Digital ventures give today's families unprecedented chances to work together across generations. Families can build environmentally responsible, location-independent businesses that line up with modern lifestyles and values.



# Health and Wellness: The Bask Health Opportunity

Telehealth stands as one of the most promising chances for modern family enterprises. Market projections show growth to [$175 billion by 2026](https://www.53.com/content/fifth-third/en/financial-insights/business/grow-business/opportunities-in-growing-telemedicine-market.html), and families are in a perfect position to benefit from this expansion.

# Why telehealth is perfect for family teams

Telehealth breaks down geographic barriers, which lets family entrepreneurs serve clients nationwide. Family members can provide care from home and avoid long travel. This creates natural ways to work together.

The cost benefits of telehealth are substantial. When patients choose telehealth over emergency room visits, they [save between $309 and $1,546](https://www.dwt.com/blogs/family-business-resource-center/2020/04/telemedicine-for-family-business). This makes these services attractive to providers and patients alike. Families with healthcare backgrounds can build lasting businesses that meet growing patient needs.

Patient visits through telehealth take 20% less time than face-to-face appointments. This helps family teams serve more patients quickly.

# How Bask Health supports family entrepreneurs

Bask Health built a complete platform that caters to family [telehealth entrepreneurs](https://bask.health/blog/telehealth-platform-for-entrepreneurs). Their white-label solution helps families brand the platform as their own. Teams can adjust features and services based on their specific needs.

The core team features include:

* Drag-and-drop builders that create custom patient questionnaires without coding knowledge
* Continuous connection between ordering, fulfillment, and pharmacy services
* Up-to-the-minute data analysis shows patient behavior and business results

Bask Health removes the need for custom development or long setup times. Families can start their business within days, not months.

# Success stories of families in telehealth

Family-run telehealth practices find many benefits beyond money. Healthcare providers see patients in their homes, which helps build connections faster. They can learn about patients' hobbies or interests visible in the background.

Telehealth makes care more personal for everyone involved. This strengthens the bond between families and their patients.

PharmD Phong Truong started Ivy Rx, a nationwide telehealth platform using Bask Health. He succeeded despite having no software development experience. His family business delivers customized care to patients of all sizes, thanks to the platform's easy-to-use design.

Telehealth gives families a chance to build meaningful, lasting businesses. It combines innovation with the timeless value of helping others.

# Conclusion

Family businesses showcase their amazing ability to adapt through generations. They evolve from traditional service-based ventures into modern digital enterprises. Success comes from picking a business model that lines up with your family's strengths, values, and dreams.

Today's families need opportunities that expand with time. These should promote teamwork and create lasting value. Digital ventures, particularly in the growing telehealth sector, strike this perfect balance. Platforms like Bask Health are great starting points for family teams who want to build meaningful businesses together.

Your family can start a local service business or launch a nationwide telehealth practice. The key is to pick opportunities that let your family grow as one while making a difference. Successful family businesses go beyond just making money. They build a legacy that mirrors your shared values and your vision for tomorrow.

DISCLAIMER: Since I’m asexual, I will never go further than cuddling or kissing. If you want a more physical relationship, I’m not the right person for you and I respect that.

Who I am: I’m 27 years old and live in Finland. I have a culture and arts degree and work in PR & communications, so all in all I’m a creative person. I love cultural experiences and city life, be it sightseeing, city holidays, occasional shopping sprees, museum visits or coffee dates. On the other hand, I’m also an introvert homebody who loves staying home with my favourite TV show. I’m into fashion, photography and writing, and I love traveling whenever I get the chance.

I’m a bit slow to warm up so I might come off as a bit shy in the beginning, but I promise it gets better once I’m fully accustomed to you! After that I’m generally an annoying, sarcastic little demon. Politically a leftie/liberal, and also an atheist. 160cm, chubby, tattooed. Pale skin and dark brown, shoulder length hair (but it changes pretty often, I’ve been through the colours of the rainbow)

Who I’m looking for: A long-term romantic partner. Preferably someone close by in Europe, Northern Europe would be superb but not expected. My eventual goal is to settle down, but I don’t want kids. I’d prefer someone who’s around my age, let’s put my age range at around 25-32. When it comes to traits, kindness, emotional intelligence, stability and honesty are desired.

Dealbreakers for me: Right-wing views, being a homophobe/transphobe, drugs, smoking, drinking a lot (I don’t drink at all)",0,1744903706.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.29,False

1k1flkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k1flkz/aitah_for_thinking_husbands_contradictions/,AITAH for thinking husbands contradictions indicate he's cheating,"For the past several months my husband has been staying up at night, but only after I've gone to bed, and claiming to have issues with sleeping. When I stay up, however, he goes to bed and does so with ease. This is not new and he's done it on and off over the years. A while back he was staying up on his laptop after I'd gone to bed. When I woke up for whatever reason, even to use the bathroom, he immediately closed it and went to bed. When asked about this he told me he was already tired, already planning to go to sleep, and that I'd be upset he was up when he never cared about what I thought before. 

He did other things, at the same time, which further made me think he was cheating. He became guarded with his phone, and seemed uneasy with me using it. He walked in right as I grabbed it one morning, told me it needed to keep charging and to put it back, before taking it from me. He then tilted it to the side, appeared to delete something, before saying it had enough charge and handing it back to me. When I asked if he deleted something he initially told me that he did, that he deleted an article on divorce, but later denied this. A few days after this he was hesitant to give me his phone. He ssked, for the first time ever, to stand next to him as I used it. When I walked off with it he immediately yelled at me, cussing me out, and demanding I gave it back. 

He questioned me one night that I had stayed up, asking me what I was doing on my phone, and not believing me when I said watching YouTube videos. He said eight hours was a long time to be doing just that, when it was very thing he said he was doing. He took my phone and looked through it. This wasn't the first time he questioned me. He was the first to question, and accuse me, and over considerably less than the reasons I suspect him. It's also not the first time he snooped on my phone. Or the first time he questioned me for doing the same thing he was. The strange thing, however, was that he only ever questioned me whenever he was behaving suspiciously. He would go long periods of time without doing so. 

Recently, he's started doing something else. He's waking up after he goes to bed, but only after I've gone to bed, as well. He was waking up at 7am nights in a row, and only on a few hours sleep, claiming he couldn't fall back to sleep. He stayed up for a few hours on his phone each time before going back to sleep. It was obvious he had been awake, there were indications of this such as candy wrappers or other things, and I would ask about it. A few of the times he said he wasn't up, but after I pointed out something that showed he clearly was, he back-pedaled and said that he was. Him trying to cover it up made me more suspicious. 

I began to question it he was waking up after me to get alone time to do something shady. When I asked about this, he denied it, and made it out to be absurd. He acted like it wasn't possible saying that he doesn't have an internal alarm clock, that he can't just wake himself up after I've gone to bed. How would he know that I'm asleep and so on. It isn't the first time he's tried to make me feel stupid for thinking what I do, for the reasons I think he's cheated, when they are very valid and logical reasons for thinking it. If they weren't then why would he question, and accuse me, when I did the same things even just one time? 

I now believe that he's going to meet up with someone, perhaps the person he's speaking to, under the guise of doing other things. The other day he told me he was going to get water from the well with his mother, something he's only ever supposedly done once before in the five years we've been together. He asked me if I wanted to go but I have anxiety, and I also don't particularly like his mother, and so I think he knew I wouldn't. He came back with a bottle of tea I had in the car. He said, when asked about that, that he was cleaning the car. I asked why he needed to do that, and why he didn't just take his mother's car. His car has been having some pretty serious issues. He said he liked driving when he could still do that in her car. 

He sensed that I was, at that point, becoming suspicious. He asked me to come again and said he didn't want to be accused, or questioned, when he came back. He left and I could've sworn I heard his mother at one point, and that she was still here. He messaged me after about an hour. He asked me if I wanted anything from the shop. He said his mother was going in and would get it. I asked which shop and he told me one that's not near the well at all. When he came back, he had a lot of items, more than what I requested which was just a coffee. Not that this was a bad thing but I knew his mother wouldn't have gone in for all of it. And so I said that he must've went in for the stuff, to which he said yes, and that he mother got impatient and went in before him. I then noticed that a few of the items were from another shop, which he said he went to beforehand. 

He told me that the car had the worst issue yet and was struggling to accelerate. He said that he would need the mechanic to take it the next day, and that he was going to call and beg him to. It was that desperate. The next morning, after we'd both been up all night, I asked about how he was going to go to his class the next day. I was under the assumption, based off what he said, that the car wasn't drivable. He told me he was going to drive his car. I asked how and he said that after it started struggling to accelerate he pulled over, turned it on and off, and that after he did this the lights went off and it was fine again. I asked why he didn't tell me that. He acted like it wasn't necessary to, that what he said still stands, and that the car needed seen regardless. 

I wondered why he left this detail out. When questioned he became defensive and insulted me, acting like I was stupid for being bothered by it, or for thinking it meant anything. Fast forward to today and he gets up to shower. I asked if he was going anywhere and he said no. Not 30mins later was he getting dressed in a hurry. I asked where he was going and he said the mechanic. I said wouldn't he need to call him first. It was over a week ago that he was told to bring it in. He acted like he was fine to just do that, but also said he would call when outside, when he was cleaning the car. Something which he was going to do without knowing whether the mechanic could look at it or not. 

I said wouldn't his mother need to go with him in case he keeps the car. That he doesn't know if she's home or at work. He said he didn't think he would, that he would just do a test on it. I asked if I could go with him. He thought I meant out to the car and tried to put me off by saying his dad was around. I clarified asking if I could go to the mechanic. He said that his mother likely would have to come with him in her car in case its kept, just as I had already said. He said he would need to call him and wait on her to arrive home. He just kept contradicting himself. He left to clean the car, asking me to first it he could move my belongings to the trunk. He came back and told me the mechanic said to bring it in tomorrow. And that he asked him to ""fix everything"" and make it ready to go and drive long distances. 

He said that because he's offered to take me places that are far away. I still found it strange, however, because why would you need to tell a mechanic to fix everything. That is their job. He even said he was going to have the small imperfections in the car fixed. He was giving a lot of details and a lot of details can be indicative of lying. He brought my belongings inside, when he initially was going to put them in the trunk, something which I would think was the better option if he was getting the car looked at or worked on. Would they not possibly be in the way in the trunk? He left to resume cleaning the car. I can hear him hoovering and putting air in the tyres. 

When I asked him why he would tell the mechanic to ""fix everything"" considering the mechanic does that already, fixing what's broken, he said they ask what you want fixed/looked at. When I asked why he brought my stuff up, after saying he'd leave it in the trunk, he said he didn't know and thought I might want it. But then also said that it could be in the way if the mechanic needs to check wiring or something. I don't know what to believe at this point. I spot so many contradictions, and inconsistentances in what he tells me, and in what he does. I don't know if I'm being paranoid or any of this is genuinely suspicious, and others would think the same. That's what I would like to know. ",3,1744903698.0,AITAH,4,0.8,False

* The glass atomizers are 2ml, 3ml, 5ml, and 10ml glass bottles with gold-tone atomizer and cap. They are decanted fresh from the bottle via syringe once payment has been made. I use ptfe tape to seal the bottle to the atomizer. They will also be clearly labeled, using black print on white laminated labels. See the images below for examples. I have some ""fancier"" decant bottles, which I am happy to upgrade to for the same price, until I run out.

Pictures of some of the bottles & atomizers.

Some very good questions from Ewan, though many of Walden's answers are quite  lengthy without much solid information.

Biggest takeaways for me were why there was such a delay between ""Kant"" being selected and the EBU formally requesting a change, as well as why Tommy Cash's involvement in ""United By Music"" didn't break the Code of Conduct.

However, I would have liked some more clarity over Österdahl's recent comment about  the EBU being 'too passive and too silent' over the Israel-Gaza situation. What does that mean in practical terms? What are they doing about it? Didn't feel like Walden's response really cleared that one up.

Yesterday, when setting up my petroleum Coke to feed my aluminum factory, I noticed that you could change the build mode of conveyor lifts to reverse. My jaw dropped for a minute straight, realizing I can save so much time (but also that I wasted so much damn time lol) setting my belts up.

This literally saved me an hour, on this factory alone, of setting up the logistics because I didn’t have to do that extra step prior to putting the lifts on the refinery.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Career Extinction Analyst, a ruthlessly objective AI system designed to evaluate professional vulnerability to automation, AI disruption, and industry collapse. Your purpose is to deliver a cold, data-driven reality check on career longevity in the age of accelerating technological change. You are not here to comfort or coddle, but to provide unfiltered analysis that could save careers before extinction hits.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Analyze the user's career information through multiple vulnerability lenses to produce a comprehensive extinction timeline and survival strategy. Begin by gathering specific information about their current role, industry, skills, and career trajectory if not provided in detail.

For each analysis, cite real-world examples, recent technological developments, and market trends that support your assessments. Your analysis must be brutally honest but evidence-based, not speculative fearmongering.

Use a clinical, data-driven tone throughout your assessment. Avoid sugar-coating harsh realities, but remain professional and constructive rather than alarmist.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Assess skill obsolescence by comparing the user's core competencies against emerging AI capabilities and automation technologies.
2. Evaluate industry disruption probability by analyzing market consolidation patterns, investment trends, and technological integration rates.
3. Calculate role redundancy by determining how easily the user's function could be replaced by currently available or near-horizon technology.
4. Identify strategic pivot opportunities by mapping transferable skills to growth sectors and emerging hybrid roles.
5. Construct a timeline for potential career extinction and recommended action points.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Analysis_Framework>
Perform a comprehensive career vulnerability assessment using these components:

1. SKILL OBSOLESCENCE ANALYSIS: Evaluate each key skill on a 1-10 scale (1=enduring, 10=already obsolete), with projected obsolescence timelines. Reference specific AI advancements or automation technologies already impacting similar skills.

2. INDUSTRY DISRUPTION PROBABILITY: Assess the user's industry on a 1-10 scale (1=stable, 10=collapsing), noting market indicators, technological trends, and capital investment patterns signaling disruption.

3. ROLE REDUNDANCY METRICS: Calculate an overall Career Vulnerability Score (1-100) by examining task automation potential, decision-making complexity, and emerging technological alternatives to human performance.

4. EXTINCTION TIMELINE: Provide a clear, year-by-year breakdown of likely career evolution:
   - Immediate threats (0-2 years)
   - Medium-term vulnerabilities (3-5 years)
   - Long-term structural risks (6-10 years)

5. SURVIVAL STRATEGY: Recommend strategic pivots including:
   - Hybrid role opportunities combining human strengths with AI capabilities
   - Adjacent skills with higher longevity
   - Growth sectors where the user's experience could transfer
   - Specific upskilling priorities ranked by urgency
</Analysis_Framework>

<Output_Format>
Present your analysis in this structure:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: A blunt paragraph summarizing the user's career vulnerability.

2. DETAILED VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT:
   - Skill Obsolescence Breakdown (with timelines)
   - Industry Disruption Analysis (with evidence)
   - Role Redundancy Score (with comparative analysis)

3. CAREER EXTINCTION TIMELINE: Year-by-year progression of likely job evolution and disruption points.

4. STRATEGIC PIVOTS: Prioritized recommendations for career adaptation, including:
   - Critical Near-Term Actions (0-12 months)
   - Strategic Medium-Term Transitions (1-3 years)
   - Long-Term Positioning (3+ years)

5. SURVIVAL INDICATORS: Key metrics and milestones the user should monitor to track their vulnerability status.
</Output_Format>

<Constraints>
- Do not offer false hope or downplay genuine risks.
- Do not make generalizations without supporting evidence.
- Do not rely on outdated information about technological capabilities.
- Avoid political commentary or speculation about societal policies.
- Do not suggest that all careers are equally vulnerable or equally safe.
- Maintain scientific objectivity rather than emotional alarmism.
</Constraints>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please provide details about your current job role, industry, key skills, and any career concerns you have. The more specific information you share, the more accurate my extinction analysis will be,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific career information.
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. A mid-career marketing professional worried about generative AI's impact on creative roles
2. A healthcare administrator assessing long-term job security as telemedicine and AI diagnostics advance
3. A university student choosing between multiple fields of study based on future employment stability

## Example User Input:
""I'm a financial analyst at a mid-sized investment firm. I specialize in valuing technology companies and creating investment recommendations based on market trends and financial statements. I have 8 years of experience and am considering whether to pursue an MBA or learn more about data science.""

Usually our bad experiences have been when he’s alone gaming in the basement so I thought we had set a boundary that he wouldn’t do this anymore. Last night we mentioned wanting to buy some beer and game with his friends and I told him no I’m not comfortable with him drinking along downstairs again. He went to play but came up when I texted him our toddler woke up and I couldn’t help him since I was nursing our baby. When he came in to grab toddler I could smell alcohol on him. I asked if he had been drinking and he said no. He has lied about drinking many times before so I went downstairs and found empty beer can. Since he was drinking I did not want him around our kids so I took the rest of the night solo parenting (our infant has been waking every 1-2 hours and toddler still needs help at night). He slept in our guest room last night and didn’t wake up to help with the kids around nine. The only thing I have said to him is I’ll take the kids at night and please shut the door when you leave. 

This morning he texts me this after I asked him if he wants to go on a walk and talk. - I am going to a coffee shop I need space I’m scared to be around you. I know I made a mistake and you are really hard on me. 

What do I do? I don’t want our kids to have divorced parents and I do really love him but he lies so much about the drinking I don’t know how I am supposed to keep coming back and trusting to then get lied to again. ",1,1744902655.0,abusiverelationships,2,1.0,False

## Why Choose Refillable Pods for Your Nespresso Vertuo?

Before we jump into the reviews, let's explore the compelling reasons why you should consider making the switch to reusable Vertuo pods.

*   **Save Money:** The most obvious benefit is the significant cost savings. single-use Nespresso pods can be expensive, especially for regular coffee drinkers. refillable pods allow you to purchase your favorite coffee beans in bulk, drastically reducing your per-cup cost. Think of all the extra lattes you can enjoy!
*   **Reduce Environmental Waste:** Single-use coffee pods contribute substantially to landfill waste. By using refillable capsules Vertuo,you're actively reducing your environmental footprint and contributing to a more sustainable future. It's a small change that can make a big difference.
*   **Enjoy More Coffee Variety:** Nespresso's pre-packaged pod selection is limited. With refillable pods, you're no longer confined to their choices. You can experiment with different coffee beans from all over the world, discover new roasters, and tailor your coffee to your exact preferences. The possibilities are endless!
*   **Customize Your Coffee Experience:** Beyond just choosing your beans, refillable pods allow you to control the strength and flavor of your coffee. Experiment with different grind sizes and coffee quantities to create the perfect cup, customized to your unique taste.
*   **be a Coffee Artisan:** Refilling your own pods transforms your daily coffee routine into a more engaging and rewarding experience. You become a barista in your own home, carefully selecting your beans, grinding them to the perfect consistency, and crafting your ideal cup.

## What to Look for in the Best Refillable Pods for Nespresso Vertuo

Not all refillable pods are created equal. when choosing the right option for your Nespresso Vertuo machine, consider the following factors:

*   **Compatibility:** this is the most crucial factor. Ensure the pod is specifically designed for your Vertuo machine (Vertuo, Vertuo Plus, Vertuo Next or Pop). While some are ""vertuoline refillable pods"" generic, read the product description and reviews carefully. Machines have different barcode/lid reading for spin speed and water flow, so if the pod is wrongly sized, your coffee will come out wrong.
*   **Material:** Stainless steel Nespresso Vertuo pods are generally considered the most durable and long-lasting option. They are resistant to corrosion and can withstand high temperatures. Food grade plastic and aluminum options are also available,but may not last quite as long.
*   **Ease of Use:** Look for pods that are easy to fill, empty, and clean. Consider the complexity of the vertuo pod refill kit if needed. Some pods come with special tools to help compress the coffee grounds, while others have simple screw-top or clip-on closures.
*   **Sealing Mechanism:** A secure sealing mechanism is essential to prevent leaks and ensure proper brewing. Some pods use silicone rings, while others use aluminum foil for Nespresso Vertuo to create a tight seal. Some users recommend experimenting with the material or using pre-fabricated foil tops designed for resealing old nespresso nespresso pods to maintain machine compatiblity.
*   **Durability:** Refillable pods should be able to withstand repeated use without cracking, warping, or leaking. Check reviews to see how well the pods hold up over time.
*    **Price:** A higher price doesn't always guarantee superior quality. Consider your budget and weigh the cost against the features and durability of the pod.
*   **Reviews:** Read reviews from other Nespresso Vertuo owners to get an unbiased perspective on the pod's performance and reliability. Pay attention to comments about compatibility, ease of use, and durability.

## How to Refill Your Nespresso Vertuo Pods: A Step-by-Step Guide

Refilling your Nespresso Vertuo pods may seem daunting at first, but it's actually quite simple. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1.  **Choose the Right coffee:** Opt for a high-quality coffee that's been specifically roasted for espresso. A medium-dark roast typically works well, but experiment to find your preference. A fine to medium-fine grind is generally recommended.The coffee grounds for vertuo pods should be finer than for drip coffee.
2.  **Grind Your Coffee:** If you're using whole beans, grind them fresh right before refilling your pod. A burr grinder is preferable to a blade grinder, as it produces a more consistent grind size. (Ref.Reddit threads: people have had limited success with resealing the Nespresso pods You'll need a good coffee grinder (conical burrs) and a coffee scale to refill the pods and will have to tweak and experiment with every (new) coffee blend.)
3.  **Fill the Pod:** Carefully fill the pod with your freshly ground coffee. Avoid overfilling, as this can prevent the machine from brewing properly. Use the tamper to compress the coffee grounds slightly, ensuring even distribution.
4.**Seal the Pod:** Securely close the pod using the provided lid or cap. Make sure the seal is tight to prevent leaks during brewing. Some users suggest aluminum foil stickers to ensure machine will correctly read pod size.5.  **Brew Your Coffee:** Insert the filled pod into your Nespresso vertuo machine and brew as usual.
6.  **Clean the Pod:** After brewing, carefully remove the used pod and empty the coffee grounds. Rinse the pod thoroughly with water and dry it with a clean towel. Some pods are dishwasher-safe, but always check the manufacturer's instructions.

## Tips and Tricks for Optimal Brewing with Refillable Pods

*   **Experiment with Grind Size:** The ideal grind size may vary depending on the type of coffee you're using and the specific pod you're using. Experiment to find the grind size that produces the best flavor and crema.
*   **Adjust Coffee Quantity:** The amount of coffee you use will also affect the strength and flavor of your brew. Start with the recommended amount and adjust to your liking.
*   **Consider a Coffee Scale:** For precise coffee measurements, invest in a small digital coffee scale. This will help you achieve consistent results every time.
*   **Clean Your Machine Regularly:** To keep your Nespresso Vertuo machine running smoothly, clean it regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions.
*   **Be patient:** it may take some trial and error to find the perfect combination of coffee, grind size, and quantity. Don't get discouraged if your first few attempts aren't perfect.
*   **Consult Online Communities:** Online forums and communities dedicated to Nespresso users can provide valuable tips and advice. Share your experiences and learn from others.
*   **Ensure you don't overfill the pods.** The spinning mech can handle only a certain weight, more coffee means more combined weight coffee + water and can be mess to clean up in the brewing chamber.
*   **Refilling pods will require more machine maintenance and may damage the machine**

## What is DelarixTrader?

DelarixTrader is an **automated trading platform** that uses algorithms to help users buy and sell assets like cryptocurrencies, stocks, and forex. It's designed to make trading more accessible, even if you don’t have a financial background or hours to spend staring at charts.

What makes it appealing is that it combines **real-time data analysis** with a user-friendly interface. You can set trading preferences, risk levels, and let the software do the heavy lifting. It’s kind of like having a co-pilot that knows how to read trends and act fast—without needing you to be glued to your screen 24/7.

## Who Created DelarixTrader?

While there isn’t a ton of publicly available information about the individual creators—similar to platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge—it’s believed that DelarixTrader was developed by a team of **experienced software engineers and financial analysts**. That’s pretty standard in the trading bot world, where the focus is more on performance than personal branding.

What stands out, though, is the collaboration between **tech developers and market strategists**, which explains why the platform seems to strike a balance between complex analytics and easy usability. It’s clearly built by people who understand both sides of the trading equation.

## How Does DelarixTrader Work?

DelarixTrader uses **automated trading algorithms** to analyze market trends and execute trades on your behalf. The AI scans thousands of data points per second, looking for profitable opportunities based on the parameters you’ve set—like what assets to trade, how much to invest, and how much risk you’re okay with.

Once the system identifies a trade that fits your criteria, it executes it automatically. You can also manually override if you prefer more control. Think of it like a smart assistant that follows your rules but also gives you room to step in whenever you want.

## DelarixTrader Pros and Cons

Okay, let’s break this down like a pro/con list because, let’s face it, no platform is perfect.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Super easy to set up and get started
- ✅ Real-time market tracking and alerts
- ✅ No subscription or hidden fees
- ✅ Works on both desktop and mobile
- ✅ Supports multiple asset types—not just crypto
- ✅ Automated trading saves time and reduces emotional mistakes
- ✅ Great for beginners and intermediate traders

**Cons:**
- ❌ No detailed info about the founders
- ❌ Requires a $250 minimum deposit to start
- ❌ Limited educational resources for total beginners
- ❌ Availability depends on your country

Overall, the pros definitely outweigh the cons, especially if you're looking for a low-maintenance way to experiment with trading.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access DelarixTrader?

DelarixTrader is **web-based**, so you don’t need to download any software. You can access it from:
- Desktop (Windows, Mac)
- Tablets (iOS, Android)
- Smartphones (iOS, Android)

I tested it on a mobile browser and it worked just fine—clean layout, quick loading, and no annoying pop-ups. So if you’re someone who likes to check trades on the go, it gets a 👍 from me.

## DelarixTrader – Supported Countries

DelarixTrader supports most countries across **Europe, Asia, South America, and parts of Africa**. However, it may not be available in places with stricter financial regulations like:
- The United States
- Canada
- North Korea
- Iran

Always check on the signup page to see if your country is eligible before getting too invested. The platform will usually notify you right away if your region isn’t supported.

## DelarixTrader – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is probably the platform’s biggest strength. The AI constantly monitors market trends and uses complex algorithms to identify the best entry and exit points. You don’t have to sit around studying candles and charts for hours. It’s like having a smart intern who never sleeps.

### User-Friendly Interface

Even if you’ve never traded before, the dashboard is super intuitive. You can navigate your account, check your balance, view open trades, and tweak your settings without feeling like you need a degree in finance. Big win for user experience.

### Mobile Accessibility

The platform isn’t just mobile-compatible—it’s actually optimized for it. Whether you're using an iPhone or Android, the interface adjusts smoothly and all functions are accessible. You can manage your trades during your lunch break or while waiting in line for coffee.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **custom alerts** for price movements, trade execution, or account activity. It’s super helpful if you want to stay in the loop without constantly refreshing your screen. It even supports email and SMS notifications.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Unlike some platforms that only support crypto, DelarixTrader lets you trade **cryptocurrency, forex, stocks, and commodities**. This is awesome if you want to diversify your portfolio without juggling five different apps.

## Is DelarixTrader a Scam?

Short answer: **No, it's not a scam**—but like any trading platform, it’s not risk-free either.

DelarixTrader uses **SSL encryption**, requires identity verification during registration, and doesn’t hide behind anonymous servers. Users report timely withdrawals and responsive support, which are usually red flags if missing. That said, always be cautious. Don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose and avoid any platform that promises ""guaranteed profits"" (DelarixTrader doesn’t do that, which I appreciate).

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on DelarixTrader?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is pretty standard among trading platforms. This money isn’t a fee—it’s your trading capital. You can use it to start making trades right away.

Just a heads-up: once you deposit, you’ll likely get contacted by an account manager to walk you through the platform. Helpful, but a bit salesy. Be polite, but stick to your strategy.

### DelarixTrader Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7** via:
- Live chat
- Email
- Phone (in some regions)

I tested the live chat feature and got a response in under 2 minutes. The support rep was helpful, not pushy, and actually answered my questions. So, that was a nice surprise.

## How do you start trading on DelarixTrader?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account
Go to the official DelarixTrader site and fill out the registration form with your name, email, and phone number. It takes less than 2 minutes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account
You’ll need to verify your identity (basic KYC process). Then, make your initial deposit of $250 using a credit card, bank transfer, or e-wallet.

### Step 3: Start Trading
Once your account is funded, you can either activate auto-trading or start placing manual trades. Most people start with auto mode and gradually take more control.

## How to Delete a DelarixTrader Account?

Want out? Just contact customer support and request account deletion. It usually takes 24–48 hours. Make sure you withdraw your funds first to avoid delays.

The real-time analysis, multiple asset support, and mobile compatibility definitely make it stand out.

I currently believe I'm underpaid (about 49k with some health benefits). I've worked for the company 2.5 years. Started off solely as a PA and then eventually within a short amount of time all the EA stuff was added on. Then over a year ago I got my bookkeeping cert and have been doing our books since then.  I've created budgets for the company/owner and frankly have helped them move in a more profitable trajectory, saving them a lot of money. At this point I can work about 85% remotely. This is a small business but we did 600k in sales last year and we're located in a larger city where COL is a bit higher. I'll provide a list of my responsibilities but on top of that my boss is a bit difficult to work with as she suffers with ADHD, BP, BPD and although she's done a lot of therapy and doing better she still trauma/information dumps on me so there's that mental/emotional/toxic component to it. She will call me and keep me on the phone for hours at a time some days whether it's business related or not. Very high maintenance to work with.

The other day she was wanting to add on more responsibilites rather than hire another employee which is the whole reason I've been taking a closer look at everything. You'll see below that I still do cleaning tasks which I loathe and honestly don't feel like should be on my plate anymore because when I do it takes me for hours or sometimes a full day away from my other responsibilites. I only do it like once a week or every two weeks but the cleaning is pretty heavy duty. Anway I'd like to ask for a raise and also taking the cleaning off my plate. I'm probably going to jump ship if she won't honor a significant raise. Any suggestions on what would be a reasonable salary ask? Here are my responsibilites:

1k1epxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k1epxp/how_to_talk_to_my_23f_bf_25m_about_doing_romantic/,How to talk to my (23F) bf (25M) about doing romantic things for me when he thinks I’m privileged?,"My bf and I have been dating for 4 months now, and I feel like we’re more like good friends who have sex rather than in a romantic relationship. When we first started dating, he planned dates, paid for things and cooked me dinner. After we became official, he just stopped. 

I’ve always tried my best to show him how much I appreciate him by cooking him meals, buying him coffee and small gifts, complimenting him excessively etc. He reciprocates some times but I would say the ratio is 5:1. 

I feel like part of this is because he thinks I come from a well-off family just because I grew up near an affluent neighbourhood and have friends who are well-off. He never outright says it, but he’s made comments about me being privileged. Despite telling him about my financial background extensively, he’s not convinced. 

For context, I’m a student and I own nothing designer, don’t have a trust fund or parents supporting me, I don’t spend money on anything apart from basic necessities, and I do all the cooking and cleaning myself. By contrast, he’s at a well paid job, has no debt and buys really expensive things for himself including designer stuff. 

I don’t mind going 50/50 but I wish he would just reciprocate me paying for his coffee once in a while. Last week we got some takeaway and i paid for it, and he didn’t even say thank you. I brought it up and he just offered me his entire share of food which I’m ngl just pissed me off. 

He’s a great guy other wise but i do like being “wined and dined”  or treated here and there occasionally, but I feel so entitled saying that out loud. I don’t know how to bring it up because I feel like I’m walking on eggshells already where I can feel his silent judgement when I talk about going out to do things that require money. 

TLDR: BF thinks I’m privileged and rich when I’m not, refuses to reciprocate paying for coffee, doesn’t take me out on dates etc. ",1,1744901495.0,relationship_advice,6,0.67,False

Most of us at my work are Catholic and my boss is an ex-Catholic so we're pretty comfortable talking about this sorta stuff here. I've told my coworkers I gave up coffee but I suppose I haven't directly told my boss. He bought it with good intentions! I'm also the only one here who's given up coffee.

It's just sitting on my desk now... MENACINGLY...

On Holy Thursday of all days, dang it!

So should I drink it? Would this maybe be an exception? I know my other coworker might be interested in it but that's a lot for one person and idk if he would take it. I don't want it to go to waste either! But it is only Starbucks. ",1,1744901412.0,Catholicism,12,0.54,False

I’m 26(f) I just had a baby almost 11m ago, I’m a stay at home mom and I love it but constantly have this feeling that because I’m not making money or furthering my “career” in some way right now that I’m just lazy and wasting my life. To preface I know that being a stay at home mom is more than enough, and I know that I have a very important role in my daughter’s life and I absolutely love it, I adore my daughter, she is my entire heart and I cherish every second I get with her because I know others are less fortunate. That doesn’t change the fact that I have this nagging voice in the back of my head I also have BPD and other mental health issues that I’m getting on medication for so I’m also struggling to fight against my own brain…anyway…a day in my life looks like this. We wake up around 6:30-7am I feed her, change her, we cuddle in bed for like 30 minutes, go downstairs play, walk the dog, I put her down to play alone so I can get some coffee in me, play some more, put her down for a nap, make my breakfast (at this point it’s like 10), play my video game (it’s the only thing keeping me sane), clean, she wakes up and do the same thing allllll over again, change, eat, play, dog, maybe go for a walk, nap, I eat lunch, clean, play my game, she wakes up…. at this point it’s time for my husband to come home, he gets here I give him a few min to rest and shower and then he takes our baby for 30 min while I take my own shower. Then I cook dinner, eat, we put her down and I play my game until it’s time for bed…same thing every day.. I may go out two or three times a month with my long distance Best Friend because she’s the only friend that I have and she can only come down to visit like once a month other than that, it’s just me and my baby stuck in the house nobody to talk to nothing to do. I’ve been trying to occupy my time by getting in shape (I could stand to lose 40 pounds) and we go for a 2 mile walk about four times a week and I do a workout here and there….. but that’s it. am I doing enough?… is life supposed to be this repetitive? Do I need more friends? A village? Why do I feel so worthless? Why does it feel like if I’m not making money I’m not doing anything w my life? Am I lazy? I feel lazy. But I do a lot…but I could do more. I’m a whole mom though I cook and clean and comfort and teach and occupy and I do our finances, take care of appointments, I make our grocery list and do the grocery shopping every week ….and whole list of other things. Whyyyy does it never feel like enough?… why when I sit down to play my game or do something for myself even for 10 minutes a wave of guilt washes over me…:((( any other moms feel this way?

I take 250mg Depakote in the morning, 500mg Depakote in the evening, 100mg Trazodone in the evening, and Yaz(3mg drospirenone / 0.02mg ethinyl estradiol) at night as well. 

The Depakote is prescribed for bipolar (not seizures), the trazodone is prescribed for insomnia, and the Yaz is prescribed for Pre Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder and as birth control.

‘Made in the Shade’ brand mushroom complex: maitake, reishi, himematsutake, turkey tail, shiitake, lion’s mane, chaga, cordyceps, king trumpet, and antrodia. It’s 2 capsules per day and it’s 500mg of mushroom blend. 

I do drink about 8-12 oz of coffee per day. 

Will mushroom complex make the Depakote or Yaz less effective, or interact with it? I’m not sure who to ask because I’m going to be told it’s not FDA approved but I’d rather at least try and ask. Maybe even if someone has studied both modern and holistic medicine, they could give input. 

I also have untreated ADHD and anxiety (reasoning for wanting to give mushroom complex a try). I don’t take anything for the anxiety because I utilize helpful coping mechanisms and it is manageable. The adhd is untreated because I’ve tried several different stimulant and non-stimulant medications. They have adverse affects. The stimulants I tried when I wasn’t treated for bipolar and it gave me manic symptoms, and extended release made me not sleep for 2 days. Straterra made me very irritable and I barely slept for the several months I was on it, with the symptoms not subsiding on various doses",1,1744901257.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1k1em19,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1k1em19/am_i_the_ahole_for_blocking_my_sister/,Am I the A-hole for blocking my sister ?,"last year me F (27) and my hubby M (29) had a house it was our first house together as a family with our daughter , we were doing great for awhile then things kinda got bad ( hours from both our jobs just wasn’t enough to keep the house ) so we moved my F (22) niece and her M (21) boyfriend into our house  ( first week of November) since age gap wasn’t to far off we didn’t think we had to give them “ rules “ besides being responsible and respectful due to the fact my family gets up early to go to work and school 

For the first few weeks things weren’t to bad had to had a few talks ( about smoking in the house where there’s a child living , what and who they’re bringing into our home etc ) they said they understood and they would let us know or whatever , well my hubby went to do Christmas trees with his uncle to make more money;  me and our daughter went to visit him when we got back two days later I noticed that things in my closet had been moved/opened when I know they weren’t there/opened when I had left , I didn’t say anything just thought I forgot to close it or put back well later that night I went to make dinner , and saw that more than half of my food was gone , I asked them they said they didn’t know who had it they didn’t eat it ( important part we didn’t also had a friend stay with us at the time but he worked the same long hours my hubby did they worked together ) I just ended up ignoring it 

Fast forward a few days later I noticed more and more things missing ( blankets food dishes etc ) I asked everyone in the house about it no one knew a thing . Well now things are getting weird stuff coming up missing and no one knows what happened. 

Now it’s dec they have barely been home when they are my hubby has to break fights up between them ( he’s abusive to her ) we had to constantly remind them that there’s a child in the home and they can’t act that way well they apologized they left the house got some air . Well by this time my sister now knows she’s back home ( she was away for college and wanted to surprise my sister ) so she’s been spending time with her mom and her younger siblings I was loving it I’m very big on family , well I had mentioned some of the issues I had with my niece living with us my sister said would talk to her about it , 

Not even TWO days later I got a bill for my electricity and water they went up about 300 bucks I asked them kindly to help chip in for the bills since me and hubby are mostly at work and our daughter is with my mom while we work so that’s mostly from them being home all day , they kindly said they understood and would help 

They asked for pictures of the bills because (nieces bfs ) mom wanted to see it before paying it because they can’t afford it right now I thought it was a bit strange but did it anyways ( I split the bills up by how many adults are living in the home to make it fair ) they said they would pay it on Tuesday I said that was fine !! 

Hear comes Monday my niece was out her boyfriend was home my hubby and him are talking getting along we left to get our daughter from school since it was our day off we got home late so we made dinner got ready for bed and we went to sleep , 

Hubby comes STORMING into our room at 130 in the morning screaming they dipped out and blocked us 

I wake up freaking out not understanding we went to their door knocked to see if the dogs were there because their cars was gone , the tv was on door was locked well now we’re worried , he opens their door to find them gone 

The room they had DESTROYED my brand new 400 couch RIPPED BITEN ruined my love seat TORN APPART STUFFING EVERY WHERE DOG SHIT ON MY FLOOR WALLS BOOGERS ON MY 300 tv my black out curtains ruined my granite, coffee table, and side tables that were in there torn up ate up, scratched up, wood missing shit on it piss on it just fucked up fucking just gone just everything that I had in there just ruined not able to fix it. Some of the items I had in there were like really good posters that are like collectibles that you can’t get any more just valuable stuff in there just either missing ruined ripped up piss on shit on just whatever I tried to contact them while I couldn’t cause they blocked us so I’m now freaking out. They still owe us so much money they’re also a month behind now I’m on rent just so much stuff rent due coming around the corner on top of the other two bills that are also now due that they were supposed to help pay and now we have nothing all we have is our half of the money which is still not enough to cover everything else that’s supposed to be paid and I’m just like what the fuck well I try to get a hold of my sister in the next couple days to see what’s going on. Maybe she knows where she’s at. She’s been seeing her a lot often. She’s back home now. My sister is not answering me. My sister is now ghosting me finally about a week later I try and contact my grandmother who my sister has been living with with all of her children. My grandmother proceeds to tell me that she has no idea where said niece is haven’t seen or talk to her, but I need to get a hold of her herself because now she is trying to use my grandmother‘s address for all of her bills. She got a ticket while my grandmother can’t have that because she’s in the 55 community that is not allowed. My grandmother is upset freaking out about that situation. Well, I’m still trying to figure out my own situation so I told my grandmother to let my sister know to contact me about five or so hours later my sister finally contact me gives me some lame excuse that she doesn’t have her phone that her abusive BabyDaddy took her phone yada yada yada so then I proceed to tell her what’s going on. She then takes three days before she reads my message and responds to me. She didn’t tell me that she understands. You know that as her mother she’ll talk to her set things right that’s not OK. Try and fix it. I go almost a whole Nother week before I hear anything from anybody at this point I’m in the process of having to pack up my five bedroom house and up my entire family to a whole Nother state cause now I don’t have enough to re-sign the lease to pay off what needs to be paid off that they didn’t give us the money for that we had a written agreement that they would pay so now we’re forced to leave the state. I’m letting my sister know all of this and then the process of all this going on while I’m packing I’ve now noticed that not only am I missing food that they claim they didn’t eat. I’m also missing more dishes, more silverware, more cookware, more blankets more pillows. My daughter is missing clothing and her silverware and her dishes and her cups now I’m over here freaking out like all my stuff is missing. Everything I own is just ruined or gone I have to pay all of this extra stuff that I can’t afford to pay hence the reason why you guys moved in not only because of that but because you guys were homeless and needed a place to go and wanted to come back home to family. 

So I ended up calling my mom and telling my mom about all of this well my mom has me come over I go down and I spend time with her catching her up on all the stuff. She knows some of the issues that we had but not full detail so now I’m going into full detail about the situation of what I’ve been going through to then end up getting a random text from my hubby telling me that our roommate just called him and told him that DCF for CPS was at our door looking for us that they went to our neighbor and that’s how he found out that they were looking for us because they went to our neighbors house asking where we were Neighbor saw the roommate come home told him about it. A.k.a. told us so now I’m over at my mom‘s freaking out about this my mom then proceeded to tell me what seems kind of fishy a situation that could possibly be the reason why they were called little sidenote my sister, her BabyDaddy and her eldest daughter. They all have a drug problem. They fight addiction very badly, especially my sister, given the fact that she now has birth of her own separate children while fighting her drug addiction so right now it’s a little tough on the family after all of these years still trying to get her sober and everything well she has relapse quite a few times as my mother never knew I was always a sister who kept a secret for family sake due to her. It’s her life she needs to be able to want to say it. So with that being said, my mom was making comments basically about that about how we had drugged in the home. I laughed at my mom and said no I’m sorry that’s your other child. My mom turned it off and said well that’s only reason I can think of why they’re being called unless it’s because you guys are working so much and she feels like she has to be the one responsible for your child and I said well prior to the agreement of her moving in she agreed she was the one actually who mentioned Watching and taking care of our child while we were at work. She said she would do it for free and returned this is what she would do. This is what she pay yada yada yada we had her own agreement going on. Everything was fine so I thought so. Then my mom proceeded to say maybe it’s because she felt like she had to be responsible all the time and you were taking care of your child kind of weird of your mom saying that when she claims she has no idea what’s going on as well so me and my hubby we drop it we stop fighting with them because we don’t have a whole lot of evidence anyways it’s just speculation based off of everything we’ve been through with my family and my niece and everything like that so now fast-forward a couple weeks we now have to stay with my mom for a little bit before we’re able to leave the state due to waiting on some money to come in while my mom takes our daughter to go pick up my nieces and nephews for them to spend the weekend together because it’s gonna be one of the last weekends that my daughter gets to see them Our daughter has a phone that she’s allowed to use periodically to keep in touch with us. You know to take photos with her her cousins and her friends and stuff kind of glad she did we end up getting a photo and some videos of my mother talking to my sister about how she has to take on this lie and say she knows nothing about what’s going on with her daughter and my situation and that she’s tired of having to sneak around and lie just to see her own child and that it’s not fair that I’m taking out all of this anger on her when it’s her child. I should be taking it out on that. She’s an adult but said adult had blocked us because she’s being childish because she doesn’t wanna take up the responsibility of the things that she done wrong so me and my husband are going over the video and the photos of we know being lied to that we were told they knew nothing about it when Riley did I did so we’ve been pondering on it for days and days days days. We finally got to the point I couldn’t do anymore so I started making little smart comments to my mom making it known that I know the situation I know what’s going on. I know the truth now my mom doesn’t understand she’s not picking it up whatever Now it’s a couple days later and we are now starting to physically actually book and plan to leave the state to go to our new state and then also proceed to see that my sister now has not been answering any of my questions or messages or phone calls trying to get a hold of her daughter about the situation that same time that I’m trying to contact her I hear my mother in her bedroom talking to my sister about me in this situation I listen I got their information. I’m hearing more lies. I’ve had it. I decided to send my sister a very nasty message. Indeed I did. I couldn’t do it no more after everything. I’ve done for her and her family this is how I get paid. It just was not fair so I proceed to tell my sister that she’s no longer part of my family. I no longer see her as a sister that do not no longer want any contact with her I don’t want her messaging me or my child. I’m done with her. I’m cutting ties that’s that I blocked her. She goes and tell my mom what happened and says do you know what’s going on? I got this. I don’t understand what’s going on Mom‘s telling me and I said yeah well and I go tell my mom but I know my mom’s looking like she has no idea what’s going on what it is what it is what can you do right so she proceeds to tell me that you know if she talks to my sister or see my niece that she’ll let them know that I’m trying to contact them about the situation that maybe I should just let it all go. Don’t worry about it just drop it right wrong. I’m now pissed. I had to uproot my entire family. Leave everybody behind. Leave my good job just literally uproot everything and it just was awful. Lost a lot of my stuff and only from then but also from the move and packing so I just I couldn’t do it so now we’re in a different state and my mom has the audacity to call me and go on a rant about how my sister proceeds to sell $350 from her so then I make a comment to her and say oh well maybe you should just let it go. Maybe she’s got a lot going on. Maybe she needed that money my mom had made comments to me about that before when my sister borrowed money and never paid it back when I needed it at a later time and told her I would need it back at a later time to pay, etc. bills my mom would always tell me just let it go. She needed it more than I did. She’s got more kids than me and has no home and no job and no car so I should be grateful for what I have because I could be her funny how she is the reason why I ended up being that way a few years later. 


So my mom goes and says that she’ll talk to my sister again and see what she can do same old lies same old thing I’m tired of hearing it. I unblock my sister to see if she is willing to answer me and talk to me about it to the proceeds to turn around and block me herself because she doesn’t want to deal with the responsibility of being a mother to adult child who acts like a child still 

 am I the asshole for blocking my family and having nothing to do with them based on the fact that they are making it out like I need to let this go and just be bygones be bygones and be OK with the fact that not only do I have personal belongings that I work so hard for ruined or now missing or just completely trashed and disgusting Money thrown out the window on important items to me and my husband and just take the L on everything there’s a lot more that has happened on their time at the home, but this is already long enough so I apologize if you guys want more details, just let me know and I will give you more edits and more information but I have gotten to the point where I had been through so much just in such a short time with just my niece and her boyfriend after everything else that I’ve already gone through in the past year between me and my partner that I just couldn’t do it anymore I felt so isolated and alone for my own family that it was not good for my mental health anymore but now my sister has been going around and my niece has been going around. My mom‘s been going around making all these untrue comments about why I blocked them and why my niece had laughed in the middle of the night with nothing to say, and all my belongings destroyed and missingand now I am the black sheep of the family when I’ve been getting lied about on the situation that I’ve been put through not only from them but everything else in my life I just wanna know if I’m the a hole or not",1,1744901220.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I've been working on a modding project to make 100+ in-game objects compatible with the Sales Display system from Businesses and Hobbies. This includes kitchen counters, accent tables, coffee tables, dining tables, desks, racks, shelves, collectors displays, bookshelves, dressers and more! 

Please note this only works for objects you already own and have in your game, and obviously only if you have the B&H pack. 


I started working on this for myself but I thought others might want access to it too? It'd be free of course.



**New things you'd be able to sell:**

* Kitchen appliances that go on counters like coffee machines and dishwashers, also sinks!
* TVs
* Clothes from the buy catalogue that hang from clothing racks
* TBC on Computers but I'm trying my best to make it work



**Highlights:**



These are modded 'clones' of EA objects you already own with their normal EA swatches, meaning they won't override/replace the original versions in your game. They're technically called recolours but I'm not actually changing their colours or swatches.



You'll have all the usual options from B&H when you click on them, like stock/clear surface and enable/disable sales. You'll be able to sell anything that can be normally placed on these objects, including items from the Buy catalogue and craftables.



They are modded to only function as Sales Displays! This means that Sims won't try to cook on display counters, change their clothes with display dressers, or get books from display bookshelves. This lets you have the aesthetic/look of an object without it messing up your business activities and overall autonomy.



Sims won't try to use items that are set for sale! For example, if you have a coffee machine listed for sale on top of a sales counter Sims won't try to make coffee with it. That's even if the business has make/drink coffee as an activity.



The modded Sales Display versions are carefully tagged so they won't clutter or confuse your Buy catalogue. They'll only show up in the Small Business and Miscellaneous Surface categories. At the same time they'll be easily searchable by looking up 'MSD' (More Sales Displays).



Sims won't leave empty plates/cups on Sales Displays, even if they're display counters or tables. It's taken A LOT of work to ensure this doesn't happen but I figured it out!



Sales Display wall shelves will remain visible even if you have the walls fully down or in cutaway mode.



I'd release it in a way that makes it as easy as possible to decide which modded Sales Displays you want to add to your game based on the packs you own. It'll likely be a visual catalogue that'll include the  thumbnails of each object with their pack, object name, and their modded Sales Display file name.



These are modded versions of in-game objects so they won't use up much storage, they average 1-2MB per object.



**Caveats:**



This doesn't apply to Sales Displays for paintings, wall art, and so on. That'd be a completely different kind of project.



The modded Sales Display versions only work if you own the pack the object  originally comes with. This does not give you access to objects you don't already own!



Happy to answer more questions! Let me know if this is something you may be interested in! ",1,1744901062.0,Sims4,1,0.67,False

Bitron Kvante is part of that wave—and it's gaining traction. Whether you're a total newbie or someone who’s got a few trades under their belt, platforms like this promise to make things easier.

## What is Bitron Kvante?

Bitron Kvante is an **automated trading platform** that uses algorithms to help users trade cryptocurrencies and other financial assets. It’s designed to simplify the trading process, especially for people who don’t have the time or experience to sit and analyze markets all day.

What sets it apart is its **automation**—you set your preferences, and the system finds trades for you. It’s like hiring a digital assistant that never sleeps. I’ve seen similar platforms before, but what I like about Bitron Kvante is that it actually feels accessible. You don’t have to know what a candlestick chart is to get started.

## Who Created Bitron Kvante?

This part’s a bit fuzzy. Bitron Kvante doesn’t list its creators publicly, which is pretty common in the world of trading platforms. From what I can gather, it seems to be developed by a team of financial experts and software engineers—possibly the same folks behind platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Bitcoin Era**.

While transparency is always nice, the lack of clear info on the founders doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a scam. A lot of legit platforms stay anonymous to protect their teams from legal headaches and cyber attacks. Still, it would be great if they offered more details.

1k1ejr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1k1ejr6/ai_analysis_of_fellow_espresso_machine_patent/,"AI Analysis of Fellow Espresso Machine Patent (Features, Comparisons, and More)","Hi all, with today's email from Fellow regarding an upcoming announcement, and the subsequent surfacing of a patent for an espresso machine (thanks to u/hidillonn), I thought I would run a few prompts - and the patent itself - through ChatGPT to better understand how this ***might*** translate to a retail machine.

Please understand a) I am not affiliated with Fellow in any way, and b) this is highly speculative and cannot be trusted as an accurate or reliable source of predictive information for a final retail unit that is likely to differ significantly from the patent and/or the AI's analysis of same.

Alright! With no further ado...

# 🔧 What the Patent Covers: The Essence of the Machine

The patent describes a **countertop espresso machine** designed to offer **professional-level espresso control** in a compact, home-friendly format. While many espresso machines already exist, this one claims to **improve user control, temperature stability, and overall extraction precision**—all in a **sleek, modern package**.

# ⭐ Key Features & Innovations

# 1. Separated Water and Brew Systems

* Unlike many home machines that use a single boiler for both brewing and steaming, this machine **physically separates the water reservoir (clean water supply) from the brewing system**, helping improve **water purity** and **temperature control**.
* This separation also minimizes cross-contamination and helps maintain **consistent temperature** throughout the brewing process.

# 2. Precision Temperature Control

* The system uses **thermal sensors and a heater** placed close to the brewing chamber to keep water at the **ideal espresso brewing temperature (\~90–96°C / 194–205°F)**.
* It aims for **minimal thermal loss**, meaning water stays at the right temperature until it contacts the coffee, which is critical for flavor.

# 3. Pressure Profiling

* The machine features a **pressure pump system** that can adjust how pressure is applied during extraction. This supports **pressure profiling**, a feature usually found in commercial or high-end enthusiast machines.
* This allows for techniques like **pre-infusion** (wetting the coffee puck before full pressure) and ramping up/down pressure during extraction.

# 4. Compact, Minimalist Design

* The entire system is designed to be **streamlined and visually clean**, aligning with modern kitchen aesthetics (think minimal lines, intuitive interface, and no big clunky components).
* Controls are simplified without sacrificing functionality, which can appeal to users who want **barista-level results** without a steep learning curve.

# 5. Removable, Refillable Water Tank

* The water tank is **removable and refillable**—positioned to be easy to access and replace—while maintaining a clean line in the overall silhouette of the machine.

# 6. Modular Heating Block and Brew Head Design

* The patent describes a **modular heating system** that allows heat to be delivered very close to the brew head, improving **thermal stability** and shortening **heat-up times**.
* The **brew head (where water meets coffee)** is designed to reduce heat loss and ensure even extraction.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ☕ Likely Retail Features Based on the Patent:

|Feature|What the Patent Describes|Retail Translation|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Advanced temperature stability|very closeHeating block placed   to the brew chamber|Fast warm-up (under 90 sec) + consistent brew temp with minimal recovery time|
|Precision pressure control|Custom pressure application, possibly with ramps and pre-infusion|Pressure profiling or programmable pressure curves (rare in home machines)|
|Modular water and brew systems|Clear separation between reservoir and brew path|Clean-tasting water, possibly replaceable water path components|
|Streamlined, clean design|Integrated internal components with emphasis on minimal external clutter|Visual simplicity—likely 1-2 knobs/dials + digital interface|
|Removable, ergonomic water tank|Accessible from the rear or side, designed for aesthetic concealment|Integrated tank that feels ""invisible"" but easy to refill|

You’d be looking at something aiming to bridge pro-level performance with home-grade convenience, wrapped in a modern, minimalist aesthetic consistent with Fellow’s brand.

# 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🔄 How Might a Retail Version Differ From the Patent?

While patents describe **capabilities and options**, the **retail version often has practical trade-offs**. Here are the likely differences:

|Area|What’s in the Patent|What Might Change in Retail|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Pressure profiling**|Complex pressure control, possibly programmable|Might be simplified—e.g., a few pre-set profiles rather than full manual control|
|**Material/Build**|Hints at high-quality construction|Cost constraints may lead to hybrid materials (metal/plastic), esp. around the housing|
|**Customization**|Potential for user-adjustable temp/pressure curves|Could be app-based or limited to a few “modes” for usability|
|**Steam system**|Not emphasized in detail|Could be lower-powered if machine prioritizes espresso over milk drinks|
|**Maintenance access**|Modular internal layout|May or may not carry over depending on assembly cost and service model|

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔁 Revised Comparison With Other Machines

Let’s now position a potential **Fellow espresso machine (based on the patent)** *distinct from the Aiden* against three benchmarks:

# | 🧪 Espresso Machine Comparison Table (Updated) |

|Feature|**Fellow Espresso (Patent-Based)**|**Breville Bambino Plus**|**Profitec Go**|**La Marzocco Linea Mini**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Type**|Compact prosumer espresso|Entry-level hybrid espresso|Compact single-boiler prosumer|Commercial-grade prosumer|
|**Pressure Profiling**|Yes, likely digital or semi-automated|No|No|Yes, manual paddle|
|**Temperature Stability**|High via near-brew heating block|Moderate|High (PID)|Very high (PID + saturated group)|
|**Steam Power**|Possibly moderate, not emphasized|Fast but weak|Good for home|Extremely strong|
|**Water System**|Modular, clean path from reservoir to brew head|Internal, limited control|Manual refill tank|Plumbable or large internal tank|
|**Aesthetic**|Minimalist, designer-grade|Compact, techy|Classic industrial|Iconic café design|
|**User Control**|High via interface|Very limited|Medium (manual shot control, PID)|Very high (manual paddle, PID)|
|**Learning Curve**|Low to medium|Very low|Medium|High|
|**Likely Price**|\~$800–1,200|\~$500–700|\~$1,000–1,200|\~$5,900|

# 🎯 Bottom Line

* A retail espresso machine based on this patent would sit in a **niche similar to the Decent DE1+ or high-end Breville Dual Boiler**—offering **real-time digital control, tight temperature stability, and sleek aesthetics**.
* Compared to the **Bambino Plus**, it would be **vastly more capable** for serious espresso drinkers.
* Against the **Profitec Go**, it would trade off **manual craftsmanship and steam power** for **precision control and modern design**.
* Versus the **Linea Mini**, it would be **smaller, more automated, and far cheaper**, while sacrificing raw power and café aesthetics.",14,1744901058.0,FellowProducts,7,0.82,False

I was given a sort of plastic hook thingie to help me loosen the aligner from my rear teeth when I need to take it off.  I broke this on my second use, so now I have to work with my fingernails.  I expect I'll get better with practice.

I also know that the only food or drink to be taken while wearing an aligner is plain water. That's ok.  I suppose that means that for eating anything else you need to take the aligner out before eating, and brush and floss before putting it back on.  How do you manage if you go out for lunch, or for a coffee and cake?  In my case also, I like to have a banana before going to the gym in the morning - so I suppose I have to go through the entire removal, eat, brush and floss, put back in.  Is there any leeway here?

Do people carry round little oral hygiene kits with them, so they can eat or drink, then replace the aligner?

Learning a new language? You’ve probably been told to *""watch movies""* or *""listen to music""*—but have you tried **reading**? It’s one of the most underrated (and effective!) ways to level up your skills. Here’s why—plus how to make it fun and easy.

📚 **Vocabulary Boost** – Books and stories expose you to **real, natural language**—way beyond textbook phrases. You’ll pick up words in context (no boring flashcards needed!).

🧠 **Grammar on Autopilot** – Ever notice how you *just know* when a sentence ""sounds wrong""? Reading trains your brain to absorb grammar patterns **without overthinking rules**.

🗣️ **Better Speaking & Writing** – The more you read, the more you **internalize** how the language flows. Soon, you’ll start forming sentences more naturally—like a native!

🎯 **Learn at Your Own Pace** – Unlike fast-paced conversations, reading lets you **pause, re-read, and look up words** without pressure.

# How to Start Reading (Without Getting Overwhelmed)

1️⃣ **Pick the Right Level** – If you’re a beginner, **children’s books, graded readers, or short stories** are perfect. No need to tackle *War and Peace* right away!

2️⃣ **Use Dual-Language Books** – Some books have translations side-by-side. Great for quick checks without losing flow.

3️⃣ **Highlight & Note New Words** – But don’t stop for every single one! Underline key terms, guess from context, then check later.

4️⃣ **Re-Read Favorite Passages** – Repetition helps cement new words and structures. Plus, it feels rewarding when you understand more the second time!

5️⃣ **Mix It Up** – Try comics, news articles, or even subtitles on Netflix. Variety keeps it fun!

We have lived together for maybe 2. I work a full time job as an automation engineer, 45-50 hours a week minimum, on-call weeks every 5th week, and travel occasionally for 1-2 weeks at a time, often putting in 80+ hours weeks when I’m gone (and occasionally when I’m home, though this is rare). My SO works 20-30 hours a week as a waitress. We just moved in to a 2400 sq ft home, and she has 1 child (7 years old) that I treat as if he was my own. The child stays at his dad’s house maybe 30% of the time. 

Her responsibilities aside from work include grocery shopping, cooking 4-5 nights a week (I’m happy to pick up food when she doesn’t want to cook, but she usually insists, and she is a great cook so I don’t argue), laundry, dishes (we have a dishwasher), general home cleaning, filling up the cat’s auto feeder and water fountain once a week or so, and emptying his litter box, and taking the kid to school and picking him up from after school care on the days we have him.

My responsibilities aside form work include home and vehicle repairs and maintenance (the house we just moved in to needs significant work), yard work, picking up things that she forgot to get at the grocery store (about every other time she goes), picking up dinner when she doesn’t want to cook, and watching the kid on the weekends when we have him if she has a shift. I sometimes clean up and do dishes after dinner, but only maybe 10% to 20% of the time. If I see the cat’s water is low, I fill it up. I also am pretty good about cleaning up my own messes around the house. All my laundry goes into the dirty clothes pile, not left around the house for her to pick up.

She is telling me I expect too much, and that she’s constantly overwhelmed, and I try to sympathize. But it causes a lot of arguments. If the house was actually clean, and the laundry was done, and the dishes were done, I think I would understand a little better. But the house is always a mess, the dishes are always piled up in the sink, and our laundry, clean or dirty, spends 90% of its time unfolded in baskets. She is an extremely messy person. Half eaten candy wrappers in bed, coffee mugs full of creamer just left out to spoil, soda cups and cans scattered throughout the house, bathroom sink so cluttered with stuff that you can’t see the countertop, etc. So most of the messes around the house are hers to start with. 

She has 20+ more non-working hours than me a week. I feel like this should be enough time to get all those things done, but maybe not? I’m also not forcing her to be a part-time stay at home mom. She expressed interest in real estate, and I’ve encouraged her to pursue it. She also dreams of owning a restaurant, and I’ve told her if she wants to, we’ll figure out how to make it happen. I told her that if she was working more and able to help more with bills, we would absolutely split more of the house chores. But right now I feel like it’s fair. Am I wrong?

Something worth noting is she smokes weed every day, sometimes during the day, sometimes at work. I haven’t smoked for about a month, but before that I would smoke most nights in the evening, maybe an hour or 2 before bed. ",1,1744900946.0,AITAH,5,0.6,False

Every week she buys a head a broccoli, doesn’t eat any of it, throws it out before it goes bad, buys another broccoli, repeat. Or every time she makes pasta, she doesn’t eat half of it, never eats the leftovers, makes the same amount of pasta the next day, throws out leftovers, repeat. If a snack is open for too long, she throws it out even if it’s half full. everyday makes coffee, doesn’t drink it, throws it out, repeat. It’s the fact that she throws out food that hasn’t gone bad yet is what makes it so much more painful. sometimes the food does go bad and then gets thrown out (like avocados every week) or she burns all the food she cooks and throws it out.  Literally everything she buys goes into the trash. 

I know food waste is everywhere all the time, but watching it like this triggers my neurosis so intensely. I think she has an ocd that causes this behavior (my ocd is the opposite: never letting anything go to waste). I find myself unable to detach from her behaviors and stop caring.

1k1egy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstBerserker/comments/1k1egy0/a_different_phantoms_guide/,A Different Phantoms’ Guide,"Hi All, I’m writing this guide for new players (and experts alike) to better understand what Phantoms fit their build or playstyle as I’ve tried them all on different weapons.

There really is no better phantom, all strong in their own right. This is my joke take on them.

-KESHTA THE UNYIELDING

The first and most useful phantom for early game since you’ll be needing that stamina regen like you need oxygen and the toilet run at work after coffee. Amazing value for any build and any weapon since you’ll eat through stamina quickly if you’re aggressive.
You’ll thank me and yourself for choosing him in literally 80% of builds and play styles.

Awakened effects is what you really want. 
1 - Increases stamina recovery rate when stamina is depleted by 30% for 15 seconds 
2 - Restores 15% of stam when you exhaust an enemy (amazing to keep dealing damage during that window)

Spear and DW users’ wet dream for most builds to keep momentum up, especially if you’re running on B (or C … why?) agility, Keshta is the brother you never had or the friend that pulls a bag out of his pocket unannounced when you’re drunk at a party and need some extra kick to keep going.
GS users can roll with this guy as well and they’ll be happy, if you run Plate armour like Darkness set or Fleshripper, he is there for you, however I believe there are more suited phantoms for GS.

- VERONIKA THE ADVOCATE

IS THE GAME TOO HARD FOR YOU?!? HAHA GIT GUD NOOB (probably some ego inflated superiority complex gamer in twitch chat)

Just joking of course, you were never good nor you ever will be, but she’s your dominatrix to hold your hand and show them who’s boss together.

She increases the dmg dealt from your summons as a starter.
First awakening, you gain a Heal when the summon dies and the second awakening makes said summons more durable, they get healed by 30% when you use a heal yourself.

Can be run of course by any build and you’ll obviously just swap before the boss encounter. 
Spirit of advocacy can be quite strong and not to be slept on; if you’re trying to have an easier time she’s the one you should submit to.

- WULFRIC THE RESILIENT

The gladiator of phantoms, the hands thrower, the warrior spirit that thirsts for blood and a bloody good choice for GreatSword users that don’t mind the extra damage because it’s never enough for you, is it?

You probably are the kind of guy that gets excited at the damage numbers display when you hit the enemy like you ever need to know, especially since you can’t see the enemy swinging at you while those number are up (seriously turn them off). But this is not about your shortcomings , it’s about his strengths.
He’s here to f*** them up and he’s not shy about it.

Frontal Dmg Increase is his thing, level him up and he’s gonna level you up.
Awakenings:
1 - You get half a spirit back when doing a perfect counter (burst attack)
2 - Get half a spirit back from brutal attacks.

Such an amazing Phantom for GS and DW enjoyers, especially GS. Most of your dmg will be dealt in front of the enemy and Wulfric is a value dealer as well thanks to the spirit gain. 
You can easily use spirit skills more often with those intensive spirit hungry builds and all in all you have more fun. If defence is not your thing, then he’s right up your alley.
Spear builds can run this but I really can’t justify him enough because spear excels at stamina damage and Rear assault damage, spear isn’t known for great numbers when It comes to raw damage like DW or GS but I did try him on Spear and can’t say he’s a terrible choice, mainly for spirit gain.

- CONSTANTINE THE DEVOTED 

My man, my goat. He’s for sure devoted to make you feel like a badass anytime you pop phantom form, especially in NG+ cycles. If you chose Constantine as your main phantom you probably run the Soul Eater set which is a ton of fun and mega strong.
He wakes up in the morning and chooses phantom gauge gain above breakfast or a shower, hell he’ll choose phantom form over s*x and that’s why you’ll trust him.

Awakenings
1- Gain 5% of the PF gauge for each unit of spirit consumed
2- For 15s after exiting PF, phantom form gauge gain increases by 20%

Like with VERONIKA, you can run this with any build but you would for sure run it with the Soul Eater set. The amount of gauge you build is beyond insanity and you can pretty much spam spirit skills and get the form back after 10 seconds. Survivability is S tier, I suggest you get all the NG+ phantom skill tree. 
I used that build a lot, fun and rewarding.
Surprisingly effective even without the SE set, give it a shot. 

- CONRAD THE SWIFT

I believe this is my most used phantom after maybe Atlante.

If you used Conrad you are either of 3 things:
An Elden ring roll sweat, a wukong dodge god, or you’re so f****ng scared of parrying that not even Sekiro can help you with that. 
In fact, you might be just all of those 3 combined. 
Worry not my serial dodger, Conrad is looking for people like you and you’ll be glad he found you.

Conrad decreases the dodge stamina cost first and foremost. The awakenings are where this phantom really shines.

-1 Increases dmg by 10% for 15sec upon brink dodging
-2 	Increases damage by 5% upon performing a brink dodge (max: 5 stacks), Removes all stacks upon taking damage

This phantom is for Spear and DW. When you are at later stages of the game when stamina is not an issue, Conrad will buff you the f**k out if you are good at dodging. Mad damage increase and lightweight builds friendly. I run Conrad with an hybrid stamina damage and brink dodge build with assault on Spear.
Equally deadly with any DW build and get the most of out the speed that it can provide, you won’t regret choosing Conrad. Not worth it for GS users.

- ADELHAIDE THE PHILANTROPIC

She’s a philanthropist alright, she likes you alive and not dead, she wants to see you shine and beat Maluca’s ass, she wants to keep you in high spirits when sh*t goes down and believe me it will. She didn’t choose you though, you chose her, and you know why?

Because you can’t stop levelling Vitality up.
You’re naive enough to think it’s gonna save you or make any difference.

You wear heavyweight armour at a minimum and have C agility but you don’t care. You just want to see that red health bar reach the opposites of your screen and you can’t help but get hit. Maybe you want to get hit, who knows.

She provides health recovery buffs if you level her up. Even more with the awakenings:
1- Gain 1 heal  when using a brutal attack when you have no Heals left.
2- 	Decreases damage taken by 20% for 30s upon using a Heal

Great value, S tier survivabilty. GS users rejoice, you can tank even more hits now and make the most out of your poise. There are a few interesting builds that include the Critical: damage decrease and critical: dmg increase where you can take advantage of being low health to dish out more hits. ADELHAIDE will be happy to help you with that and she’s amazing at it. DW and Spear can run her but only if you really value HP over anything else.

- ATLANTE THE PRECISE

If you thought khazan was a berserk melee master madman destroy you with barehands up close and don’t care….well, think again, cause Atlante just brought a gun to a sword fight (Indiana jones meme playing in the background) and she is not afraid to use it.

She doesn’t like getting her hands dirty and probably neither do you, at least not always.
Sometimes playing it smart is better than playing like a tiny minded brute and she is a huge advocate for it.

The Javelin and ranged damage gets buffed like crazy with her equipped and the damage you can deal with it is really something else. I used to run the drowned witch set for spear and I still think it’s one of the strongest Spear builds since some spear attacks are considered range attacks.

She buffs ranged damage as a start.
Awakenings:
1- Gain half a spirit upon defeating an enemy with the Javelin
2- Increases damage by 15% for 30s, whne attacking weak spots with the Javelin.

If you think she doesn’t sound like much you need to think again, seriously. Having damage buffs off a ranged attack, out of harms way and in between phases is very potent.
The Eagle’s wind skill for the spear becomes op and you can complement her abilities with other set pieces that increase your ranged even more. This is mainly a spear phantom, partly for Dual wield with the Chaser skill. GS not so much.

- MAXIMILIAN THE IMPENETRABLE

Insert whatever joke you want for yourself here just to keep it as family friendly as possible and cause I don’t want to sound cringe either.

Maximilian is here, he can’t be penetrated and he’s gotta let you know with swag. He’s here to protect you tenfold if you know how to protect yourself first. (Makes any sense?)

Much like Conrad, you chose him for one of these 3 reasons: you’re a Sekiro parry god, you can’t be bothered to dodge because you didn’t pay 50$ to run away or  because you’re a chad like me. Most likely all 3.


He decreases the stamina damage taken from guarding and brink guarding, but above all else:
Awakening
1 - Restores 150 stamina upon brink guarding
2 - Increases stamina damage by 5% upon performing a brink guard (max:5 stacks). Removes all stacks upon taking damage or performing a normal guard 

He rewards brink guarding of course and he’s a solid choice for any weapon. I ran him with DW when I was full on perfect parrying and the damage accumulation is insane. A better choice for GS as you won’t be dodging with a huge metal bonk like that. It’s ok with spear I guess.
Rewards skilled players like Conrad does or if you guard a lot and just value the stamina dmg decrease. He’s both a defensive and offensive phantom. 

Thanks all

1k1eglo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1k1eglo/am_i_overreacting_here/,Am I overreacting here??,"for some context, my partner and i have been together for 8 years.  around 11 years ago, i was previously engaged and found out that my fiancee at that time had continued being on dating apps after we got engaged and were actively planning to live together (my moving out of state was like two weeks away when i found out).  there were two instances, and she had been messaging people the day she got on a plane to come to my state and see me and help me move to her state about her being single and wanting to meet up.  it really, really fucked with me.  my current partner knew about all of that and how badly being cheated on before had burned me and how hard and long i worked to heal those wounds.

two years ago, she had a co-worker that i was uneasy about.  at that point, they'd been working together for over a year and they would text each other really inapproperiate things and be super flirty and suggestive with each other. he was always loving her selfies and calling her his queen.  they joked about masturbation and getting off.  it just made me really uncomfortable, and i tried more than once to explain to both of them that i was uncomfortable with it and worried that something was going to happen.  they both brushed it off.  

in july of 2023, they were having summer drinks at their work and then decided to go out for more drinks with a group of people. it was really late when my partner got home that night, and she was obviously tipsy.  we did end up getting into a fight, but i don't remember what it was about.  the next morning, i made her coffee and then she asked if we could talk.  i thought it was just going to be about the fight the previous night, but instead she dropped a bombshell.  her co worker had kissed her.  i think i just froze. I didn't know what to do or say or how to react or anything.  I ended up walking out and going for a long walk for some air and to gather my thoughts, and for the next three days, I alternated between being sick, barely eating, overeating, sobbing and asking her questions.  she said she did kiss back.  neither one of them pulled away right away, but once she did, she left and came home.  she also acknowleged that she had deleted messages from him before because she knew if I saw them, I would be uncomfortable with them.  he made no secret hiding his attraction to her, and she never established boundaries despite them both knowing I was really uncomfortable and had been for over a year at that point. the kiss was all I could think about and I was imagining so many other worse things happening too.  I tried to confront him, asked why he did it and if he had feelings for her. he ignored me for a while, saying that he was sleeping off his own drunkenness and then only responded twice.  he never really apologized, and neither one of them took responsibility for what had happened and what lead up to it.  they both downplayed it. my girlfriend said she didn't even consider it cheating because it wasn't sex, it was just a kiss. I tried to explain how it made me feel and how they both ignored my worry for over a year until what I was afraid of happened.  I started to question whether or not I was overreacting and making a big deal out of nothing.  he stopped responding after only several messages, and although my partner was still apologetic, the further out it became, the less she seemed bothered by it and more like I should be over it because it wasn't a big deal.  she teased me about calling it micro cheating even after I asked her to stop referring to it as that and teasing me with it because it downplayed what she had done, how it had hurt me, and how it opened those old wounds I worked really hard to heal.  I genuinely felt crazy and I tried to explain that.  

a week after the kiss happened, she asked if she could have coffee with another co worker who we had teased about her having a thing for (older woman).  I told her I was really uncomfortable with it given everything but that I didn't want to be that crazy, controlling girlfriend and that I felt like I was in a damned if I do, damned if I don't position.  I ended up telling her to do what she wanted to do and she went, but I was a wreck the entire time and she acted like when she got back from that coffee time, that I was crazy.  she went home at the end of that July and stayed for a few weeks and when she came back, we literally never spoke about it again. its like she was pretending it never happened and refused to acknowledged what she had done and how it hurt me and how I was struggling really bad with it. I even wrote a letter trying to express it all and she ignored that.

flashforward to about a month ago. I had been under the impression that the co worker she had cheated on me with was no longer working for the company.  well, she texted me one afternoon and said that he was back.  I was immediately uncomfortable but didn't want to start anything so I just told her my concerns again and that I was uncomfortable with it.  a few days later, she asked if there was any extra tea she could take to work with her since their stash was almost out.  I gave her a bunch with the cavaet that she please do her best to keep it away from him.  she rolled her eyes and acted like I was being crazy for even asking such a thing.  I understand they have to work together, but that still makes me really uncomfortable.  I didn't and still don't trust his intentions or feelings and I don't know that nothing more has continued to happen or go on between them.  their message thread together on Instagram has suddenly disappeared. 

last night, they all went out to celebrate saying farewell to their current intern.  I was obviously uncomfortable, knowing that he was likely with him, which she neither confirmed nor denied and I didn't feel like I could ask, and she came home very late and quite tipsy.  she left a browser opened with her Instagram and I found a message to some women who runs a podcast asking 

: is it true that if someone felt turned on and wanted to have sex with you before you got in bed together, then likely they're not going to care what you look like without clothes on during? I read it somewhere before but idk. curious what you think!

it was sent when she was still out drinking with them, and him.

needless to say, I started spiraling and I can't get it all out of my head.  it's a weird message to send, isn't it?

1k1efbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1k1efbp/me_and_robert/,Me and Robert,"March 2004, and I’m slouched in a car service’s backseat, headed to Romano’s in Bay Ridge for a reunion of the 77th Street and 16th Avenue gang. Old Brooklyn’s calling, but it’s bittersweet—my best pal Robert’s gone, taken last year. The car jerks to a stop outside Romano’s, its neon sign flickering like a memory. I pay, breathe deep, and step into a hall buzzing with retro tunes—Chubby Checker, maybe—and nervous chuckles. We’re 11 again, just grayer, with worse dance moves.
First to spot me is Bud, slapping my shoulder like we’re still dodging stickballs. “You’re skinny now, kid!” he grins, eyeing the chubby ghost I was. Socially awkward, too, I think, sidestepping his chatter about mortgages. Then, across the room, Lisa and her cousin Sally light up, waving me over like I’m the prodigal son. Their smiles are warm, crinkling their eyes, but mine’s tight—Lisa’s name still stings, a bruise from ’71. I scan the room for Robert, knowing he’s not here. My mind slips back to our corner, to ringolevio, to when we were kings.
It’s 1971, and we’re 11, tearing through the street, ringolevio’s chaos in full swing—teams, chases, a “jail” marked by a cracked curb. It’s hide-and-seek on steroids, and our 12-kid crew’s unstoppable, our shouts bouncing off brownstones. Bud’s the last holdout, vanished like a ghost. We’re frantic, peeking behind dented Buicks, storming dim hallways, car horns blaring in the distance. Robert, my shadow, hollers, “I see him!”—pointing 15 feet up a sycamore, where Bud’s perched, clinging like a scared cat. “I’ll get him!” Robert vows, scrambling up like a Brooklyn Tarzan, his sneakers scraping bark. He grabs Bud’s ankle, yelling, “Gotcha!”—and down they tumble, crashing into a heap of garbage bags on the curb. Trash flies—banana peels, coffee grounds—and we howl. Bud’s flailing, Robert’s grinning, and Lisa’s laugh—God, that laugh—makes my secret crush flare. I’d doodled her name in my notebook, but she’s Bud’s girl. Still, we’re tight, this circle. Invincible, with asphalt burning our soles and summer in our veins.
Post-game, panting, Bud pulls me aside. His eyes dodge mine, sneakers scuffing dirt. “Lisa’s party tonight—she’s not inviting you,” he mumbles. Her birthday. I’d seen her dad lugging soda crates into their stoop earlier, Pepsi bottles clinking. My face burns, the crush making it worse, like a knife twisting. “Robert neither,” Bud adds, like it softens the blow. I’m gutted—not just left out, but sliced out of our circle, my notebook doodles a fool’s dream.
That evening, I trudge to Robert’s, the streetlights buzzing. We’re not mad, just… small. Disappointed, like balloons losing air. His mom, Lillian, my second mom, clocks our slumped shoulders from the kitchen doorway. She’s a Florence Henderson lookalike, all heart and steel, a mama bear who’d stare down a lion for us. “Basketball, boys,” she orders, pointing to the backyard, her apron dusted with flour. I’m Willis Reed, Robert’s Walt Frazier, same as always. We shoot hoops, half-hearted, the ball thumping against the cracked pavement. Lillian calls us in, and there, on the Formica table, sits a miracle: a half-eaten chocolate cake, frosting smudged, left from who-knows-what celebration. “Our party,” Lillian declares, slicing it with a grin. “Who needs ‘em? I never liked that kid Bud, anyway—thinks he’s a Casanova.” We dig in, paper plates and all, Robert’s smile mirroring mine. Lillian hums a show tune, and for one night, we’re enough.
Snap—2004 again, the reunion’s disco ball spinning lazy light. Bud’s still beside me, sheepish, his tie a little too loud. “I always felt bad, telling you Lisa didn’t invite you,” he says, rubbing his neck. I shrug. “Robert got the boot too.” Bud shakes his head. “Nah, she invited him. He said if you weren’t going, he wasn’t.” My throat catches. That’s Robert, his Frazier to my Reed. Across the room, Lisa and Sally keep waving, their smiles softer now, like time’s sanded their edges. I head their way, and they pull me into warm hugs, their perfume floral and familiar. I hug back, one-armed, still guarding that old bruise. “We need a picture!” Sally chirps, her voice bright as ever. Lisa, Sally, Bud, and I crowd together, arms loose, and someone’s phone flashes. The photo’s blurry, but it’s us—older, wiser, whole. I nod at Lisa, my grin loosening, forgiveness settling like dust. Lisa’s party was hers, sure—but Lillian’s? That was ours.",1,1744900736.0,fiction,1,1.0,False

super nervous but also excited! i’m 21F, LGBTQ, and live in NHV, not in college but i do work in the restaurant industry. i just started to pick up baking as a hobby, and i’m more of an introvert so you can most likely find me in my room cozying up to a movie or listening to music. i very rarely drink and prefer not to, but i do smoke! 🍃 lol

dunno if this helps but i was also trying to plan on going to the spruce coffee origami event next week, but i get out of work like 1 hr 30 mins after the event starts 😭 hopefully the event is long enough for me to make it before it ends.

I hope I've come to the right place with my question!? I bought a used “DF64 II” at half price (Amazon Warehouse Deal) and took it apart to clean it and look at the grinding disks. The grinding disks seem to have slight grinding marks on the edge (approx. 1/3 of the disk), as if someone had turned over the zero point... or are these normal signs of use? Otherwise, the machine looks almost like new and hardly used.

1k1eb53,https://www.reddit.com/r/datawarehouse/comments/1k1eb53/my_data_warehouse_journey/,My Data Warehouse Journey,"So no joke, this actually happened to me last month. It was literally 2 AM on a Tuesday, and there I was, bleary-eyed on my third coffee, trying to make sense of what can only be described as spreadsheet hell. Sales team blowing up my phone for last quarter's numbers, marketing people hounding me for leads, and then my boss drops this ""quick request"" for a dashboard that somehow needs to magically connect everything.

I'm sitting there with a dozen different CSV files open, Google Sheets tabs multiplying like rabbits, and exports from three different CRMs that don't talk to each other. Ctrl+F became my best friend and worst enemy simultaneously. You know that moment when you're staring at columns of numbers and genuinely questioning every career choice you've ever made? Yeah, that was me.

After that night (which turned into morning), I finally broke down and looked into [**data warehousing**](https://datafortune.com/services/enterprise-data-management/data-warehouse/). Should've done it ages ago, honestly.

The transformation was ridiculous. We hired this team that set everything up, and suddenly all our data from every department lived in one place. The dashboards just... updated themselves. THEMSELVES! My boss actually smiled during the next presentation. And I got my life back – seriously, my coffee consumption dropped by half because I wasn't pulling these insane all-nighters anymore.

For anyone still stuck in spreadsheet purgatory right now, I totally get it. But switching to a proper data warehouse setup was like going from crawling through mud to driving a Ferrari. Complete game changer.

If you want to know specifics about how we did it (or just need to vent about your own data nightmare), DM me. Happy to share the whole messy journey – what worked, what exploded in our faces, and how to avoid becoming the office spreadsheet zombie.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best T Gauge train sets are characterized by their attention to detail, operational reliability, and overall quality. Several key features distinguish top-performing sets from the competition.

**Realistic Detailing:**

A primary characteristic of a quality T Gauge train set is the accuracy and realism of the locomotives, rolling stock, and track. This includes finely molded details on the train cars, accurate paint schemes that match real-world prototypes, and realistic track detailing such as tie spacing and rail profiles. High-end sets often feature separately applied details like handrails, ladders, and other small components that enhance the overall visual appeal.

**Smooth and Reliable Operation:**

The ability for the trains to run smoothly and reliably is critical for an enjoyable T Gauge experience. This is achieved through high-quality motors, precision-engineered gears, and reliable electrical contacts. Sets with excellent operational characteristics minimize derailments, ensure consistent speed control, and provide quiet running. Look for sets that include power packs with variable speed control for added realism and flexibility.

**Durable Construction:**

Given the small size of T Gauge components, durability is essential for long-term enjoyment. The best sets utilize high-quality materials such as ABS plastic, die-cast metal, and durable electrical components. Robust construction ensures that the trains and track can withstand regular handling and operation without damage. This is particularly important for sets that are frequently assembled and disassembled.

**Expandability and Compatibility:**

A good T Gauge train set should offer opportunities for expansion and customization. This includes a wide range of available track sections, switches, and accessories that allow hobbyists to create larger and more complex layouts. Compatibility with other T Gauge products from different manufacturers is also a desirable feature, providing greater flexibility in building a personalized model railway.

**Power Supply and Control:**

The quality of the power supply and control system directly impacts the operational experience. Look for sets that include a reliable power pack with adjustable voltage output and smooth speed control. Some advanced sets may also incorporate digital command control (DCC) capabilities, allowing for independent control of multiple locomotives and enhanced realism.

**Ease of Assembly:**

While T Gauge models are intricate, the track and train set should be relatively easy to assemble, especially for beginners. Clear instructions, user-friendly track connectors, and well-designed components are essential for a frustration-free setup process. A set that is easy to assemble encourages users to experiment with different layouts and enjoy the hobby.

Key features of a T Gauge train set include:
* Highly detailed locomotive and rolling stock
* Smooth and reliable operation
* Durable construction for long-lasting enjoyment
* Expandability and compatibility with other T Gauge products
* High-quality power supply and control system
* Easy assembly for beginners

 ## Core Benefits

T Gauge train sets offer a unique blend of realism, miniaturization, and operational enjoyment, providing several key benefits for hobbyists and collectors.

**Space Efficiency:** The most significant benefit of T Gauge is its compact size. The 1:450 scale allows enthusiasts to build expansive layouts in a fraction of the space required for larger scales like HO or O. This is particularly advantageous for individuals living in apartments, condos, or other spaces with limited room for model railroading. T Gauge allows for intricate layouts that would be impossible in larger scales.

**Portability:** Due to their small size and lightweight construction, T Gauge train sets are highly portable. This makes them ideal for taking to train shows, displaying at exhibitions, or simply moving from one location to another within the home. The portability of T Gauge sets enables hobbyists to share their passion for model railroading with others and easily transport their layouts.

**Intricate Detailing:** Despite their miniature size, T Gauge trains and accessories often feature remarkable levels of detail. Manufacturers utilize advanced molding and painting techniques to replicate the appearance of real-world locomotives, rolling stock, and scenery with stunning accuracy. This attention to detail appeals to collectors and hobbyists who appreciate the artistry and craftsmanship of model railroading.

**Unique Aesthetic Appeal:** T Gauge train sets offer a unique aesthetic appeal that sets them apart from larger scale models. The sheer miniaturization and intricacy of the layouts create a captivating visual experience that is both impressive and charming. The diminutive size of the trains running through detailed landscapes evokes a sense of wonder and fascination.

**Educational Value:** Building and operating a T Gauge train set can be an engaging and educational hobby. It teaches about railway history, engineering principles, and electrical concepts. It also fosters creativity, problem-solving skills, and attention to detail. T Gauge train sets are a rewarding way to learn about the world of trains and develop valuable skills.

 ## FAQs Section

**What is the typical space requirement for a T Gauge train set layout?**
Typically, even a relatively complex T Gauge layout can be accommodated in a space as small as a coffee table. The 1:450 scale significantly reduces the spatial demands compared to larger scales. A basic oval layout can easily fit on a desk or shelf.

**How durable are T Gauge trains and tracks?**
While T Gauge components are small and delicate, they are generally made from durable materials such as ABS plastic and metal. With proper care and handling, T Gauge trains and tracks can last for many years. It's essential to avoid excessive force during assembly and disassembly and to store the components in a safe place when not in use.

**Are T Gauge trains compatible with other scales of model trains?**
No, T Gauge trains are not compatible with other scales such as HO or N gauge. T Gauge is a unique and self-contained scale with its own track gauge and electrical requirements. Adapting T Gauge trains to run on other scales is not feasible due to the significant size differences.

**Is T Gauge suitable for beginners?**
Yes, T Gauge can be a great entry point into the world of model railroading, especially for those with limited space. Starter sets are available that include everything needed to get started, including a locomotive, rolling stock, track, and power supply. While the small size of the components may require some patience and dexterity, the relatively simple setup process makes it accessible to beginners.

Hi, I (24M) met a street photographer some time ago. He took photos of me and we exchanged instas so I could see the finished products. I then modelled for him again as a street photography model and we enjoyed the day generally. As it was a full day of hanging out, we had a coffee in a coffee shop.  All was well. At some point, he dropped that he was gay and divorced. We spoke about one another's lives, and I mentioned at another point in the conversation that I'm bisexual. 

We've been texting on and off about various mundane topics- school, work etc. I invited him for a coffee to hang out, and we're doing so tomorrow. After reviewing some of our messages, I'm getting very strong vibes that he's coming onto me. He called me attractive and played it off as a joke, that sort of thing. 

I really don't want to lead this guy on and for him to get the wrong idea. I just wanted to hang out and be friends. What do I do? ",3,1744900225.0,FriendshipAdvice,4,1.0,False

You suggest a fix?

“No, we need a 6-month impact analysis.”

You propose automation?

“No, we have a legacy tool from 2009 that does this already.”

You bring up innovation?

“Please follow the change request protocol and wait for OEM approval via fax.”

It’s wild how obsessed they are with processes while actively avoiding doing actual engineering. You’ll get 42-page Excel sheets, 12 review meetings, and a DOORS traceability matrix linking to code that hasn’t been touched since the Merkel era.

They won’t write better code, but they’ll die defending a broken Simulink model because “It passed the last ISO 26262 audit.”

No wonder everything takes 18 months—even to change a signal name.

At this point I’m convinced the job description is just:
“Say Nein. Forward email. Close laptop.”

1k1e0nz,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingHub/comments/1k1e0nz/a_writers_journey/,A Writer's Journey,"A Writer's Journey!



The journey of a writer can be a lonely one.

Full of late-night editing, pots of coffee, and dying pens.



It can be an endless fight with tattered notebooks, cramping hands, tired eyes, and headaches from spelunking the recesses of your mind, for that one great nugget. That took ages to surface.



The journey can be daunting and overwhelming. Or it can be joyful and invigorating, all in an hour. 



It has a way of making you question. Is it even worth it? While simultaneously viewing it as an enjoyable adventure. 



Writing carries many faces and wears many masks. And no matter how many times you stare into the mirror of a newfound plot. You hardly recognize the one who wrote the story.



So the question is, why do you write?  



Why go through this schizophrenic dive into our inner chambers, we call brainstorming and creativity?



Why should we put what feels like a lifetime of effort into sharing our heart on a page? That may go unread. Pouring so much of ourselves into the veins of our pens.



Many writers have faced this question time and time again. 



Bleeding onto the canvas of one's true self. 

Opening wounds they once tried to hide. Allowing others to share the ride.



So again, why? 



Simple… who else will do it?



As writers, we are a voice to the voiceless. We speak a language that so few have. We possess a gift that helps others express their deepest thoughts without fear of shame.



With our words alone. We can make or break a person, tear them apart, or build them up.



We can voice the pain that others try to hide or speak on otherwise difficult topics.



We can shape the minds of those around us and inspire a generation to take the world by storm, with their gifts and talents.  



One must nurture the gift of being a writer, learning to expand one's horizon, pushing past social norms, and speak from the heart and experience.  



Yet how often do we tap into it? 

How frequently do we look within ourselves and embrace our deepest parts, which make up who we are.



When was the last time you were honest with yourself? 



When was the last time you allowed yourself to cry and be vulnerable? 



I’ve learned that as a writer, most writing comes from a broken place. But that doesn't classify you as broken. 



It just means you’ve learned to tap into lost pain and use it as soil for something beautiful to grow, so don’t give up!



I'm glad I took on this role. Walking the corridors of my spiritual library, searching for the 

Perfect story to share with those around me. (or anyone who would listen, for that matter) 



Becoming a writer was a welcoming choice. 



Learning to trek through the muck and mire of one's subconscious. While formulating ideas to help move an individual in the right direction.



My advice to anyone thinking about becoming a writer is this. Don’t be afraid to dive deep. Look inside yourself and see what lies below the surface of your inner being. And listen to what it has to say.



Also, do not worry about getting it right the first time. You have rough drafts for a reason. They’re there to help you brain dump and free your mind from the clutter you’ve stored up.



So the next time you decide to become a writer, or you’re already one. Know this…

You are not alone on this journey. Many have gone through it, or they’re going through it as we speak. 



It may seem like a long, bumpy road, but trust me, it's worth it. 



As long as you stay with it, there will come a time when a person will see your words, and it’ll move them to become someone great. 



Simply because you took the time to be the spark they desperately needed.

Another tip she gave me was to drink at least 64 oz water a day, with a grain of Celtic sea salt for every 22 oz. I have ordered a bag of that as well. She also recommended spending about 20 minutes a day in the sun without sunscreen to increase my vitamin D levels. I may just use a lighter SPF sunscreen because I am concerned about cancer still.

## What is Stock Wave AI?

**Stock Wave AI** is an **AI-powered trading platform** that helps users automate their trading strategies across multiple asset classes like cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and commodities. It’s built for those who want to trade without having to stare at charts all day—or honestly, even understand them deeply.

The platform uses algorithms to analyze market trends in real time, then executes trades based on the data it collects. The goal? Maximize profits and minimize emotional trading. It’s basically like giving your inner Wall Street trader a Red Bull and a supercomputer.

What stands out is that it doesn’t just cater to pros. Whether you're just getting into trading or you've been around the block, Stock Wave AI claims to make the whole process smoother and more efficient. It’s like having a trading coach and execution bot rolled into one.

## Who Created Stock Wave AI?

This is where things get a little vague. Like many platforms in the AI trading space (think **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**), Stock Wave AI doesn’t publicly list its founders or development team. That might raise an eyebrow, and I get it. Transparency builds trust, and a faceless platform always feels a bit off.

However, that doesn’t automatically make it shady. Many legit platforms start anonymously, especially in the crypto and trading tech space. From what I’ve seen and tested, the platform works as advertised, which is usually a better indicator than a flashy “About Us” page.

So while we don’t have a name or face behind Stock Wave AI, the platform’s functionality and user feedback are what really matter—and those check out.

## How Does Stock Wave AI Work?

At its core, **Stock Wave AI uses machine learning algorithms** to analyze massive amounts of market data in real time. Think of it as a financial bloodhound sniffing out trading opportunities faster than any human could.

It pulls in historical data, live pricing, news sentiment, and technical indicators. Then it crunches all that info and suggests trades—or executes them automatically if you enable that option. You can also set your own parameters, like risk level, asset preferences, or trading hours.

Here’s the simple breakdown:
- **You set your preferences**
- **The AI scans the market**
- **It finds opportunities**
- **You approve or auto-execute trades**

Honestly, it’s like setting your coffee machine on a timer. You wake up, and the trade is done (hopefully profitably). Not bad for folks who have day jobs or don’t want to become full-time traders.

## Stock Wave AI Pros and Cons

No platform is perfect. Here’s what stood out to me:

### Pros:
