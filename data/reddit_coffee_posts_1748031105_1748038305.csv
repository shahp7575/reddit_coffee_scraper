30 | Based in Cymru (Wales) since 2017 | Originally from the US
Chef, heritage nerd, marathon runner, museum enthusiast

I’m someone who loves deep chats over coffee just as much as long drives with a good playlist. I moved to Wales reconnect with my dads side of the family and never looked back—now I spend my days working in heritage, studying Welsh history, and cooking up way too much food for one person (so I hope you’re hungry).

Outside of work and studying, you’ll usually find me:
– Training for my next half or full marathon (currently chasing that sub-2 hour half)
– Exploring museums, castles, and archives like a kid in a candy shop
– Talking about identity, devolution, or why Hermes is tattooed on my hand (or any of my tattoos really)
– Baking something sweet after a long run—balance, right?

Open to new friends aged 25–35—I’m just looking for thoughtful, kind people who are up for museum days, heritage chats, relaxed dinners, or cheering each other on through life (and maybe through a few miles).

Let’s hang out, share stories, and build the kind of friendship that makes everyday stuff feel a little brighter.",1,1748038201.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1ktvzbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1ktvzbh/help_is_it_supposed_to_be_this_bad/,Help! Is it supposed to be this bad?,"So, I’ve been resisting Ozempic because my goal is to be on fewer medications, but my doctor finally talked me into it, as my A1C was inching up.  I was injured and unable to exercise as much recently, but my doctor encouraged me to start Ozempic to help me get my blood sugar under control quickly.
I took the first, lowest dose shot last night, and I am miserable. I’ve always had a high pain tolerance and thought I handled things well, but my abdomen hurts, sharp pains, and I’ve been having diarrhea for about 8 hours now; I kinda just collapse in between bouts 😬
Most people on here seem to be having an easy time of it.  Am I just having a bad reaction and need to not be on this?  Has anyone else had a tough start, but level out?  If I weren’t off work today, there’s no way I’d have been able to work. I can’t have a day like this every week. To me, I’d rather fight the blood sugar and weight without this instead of lose entire days in the bathroom. 
And I didn’t even drink coffee this morning; it’s been water all day.  I’m aware some foods make it worse. I haven’t had those foods.

The scent of coffee,
as dark as can be,
clogs my nose and 
floods every inch of the house.
Blue of her glare caresses the faces 
of the unknown,
gently; tenderly.
Eyes of guilt and sorrow,
far as the eye can see.

Sat in the corner of the
pulmonologist office,
with pent up frustration,
and an entangled fragility.
I knew the results before the test.
I know the effect before the cause.

I know no one will know and
I know they wont be left yearning.
I know I am nothing more
than a mosaic of the soulless.

The school bells echoes through the 
walls of hatred and agony,
The altar of the school logo
stands prideful still.

The gleam in her eyes still spark of vigour,
no chance for any dirt within.
The spot in her home, once filled,
stays cold and empty.

If this is how I go,
antagonised for being, but
caressed in the arms that first held me,
I will be content with the life I've lead.

He has two young daughters (5 and 8), and I moved in with them about six months ago. Adam is very protective of the girls and didn’t introduce me to them right away. When he did, he encouraged me to win them over by buying gifts and making their favorite meals.

Since Adam works long hours, I spend a lot of time with the girls. They've grown really attached to me, and I care about them too. But now I can’t go anywhere alone, even running errands or grabbing coffee means bringing them along. I barely have personal time anymore, and it's starting to wear on me. My work has also suffered because of it.

Now, my best friend is getting married in another city, and it's a kid free event. When I told Adam, he immediately said I shouldn’t go. He claimed the girls would be upset and that he couldn’t take time off to watch them. I suggested hiring a babysitter, but he refused and said I was being selfish for choosing a party over our family.

Things got worse when he told the girls I was trying to get away from them. Now they’re upset with me and won’t talk to me. Adam says it’s my fault for putting my friend over his daughters and that I should be grateful they like me at all.

I feel hurt and stuck. I love the girls, but this is my best friend’s wedding, I can’t just skip it.

The rate is $2,400 (ik expensive!) for the entire space but we can discuss a potentially discounted rate. 
Pets are allowed (at an extra fee) and there is garage parking available for $150/month. 

I also have furniture I can sell (for a cheap price) if you are interested. If not, I will remove them before your move-in.

The apartment is very spacious and is good for a single person or for a couple. There is enough space in the bedroom for a queen bed and a vanity. There is a walk in closet attached to the bedroom. 

The living room is also quite spacious— it will easily fit a couch coffee table, TV, etc. The kitchen has a lot of counter AND pantry space. The bathroom is also enormous.

1ktvo75,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1ktvo75/could_oxiclean_max_force_stain_remover_spray/,Could OxiClean Max Force Stain Remover Spray Revolutionize Laundry? A Detailed Review,"**OxiClean 757037400005 Max Force Laundry Stain Remover Spray Review**  

Testing out the OxiClean 757037400005 Max Force Laundry Stain Remover has been a game-changer in my weekly laundry routine! Stains are no strangers in my household, thanks to kids, pets, and my hapless coffee-spilling habits. After trying out countless stain removers, discovering a product that promises to tackle dried-in messes seemed almost too good to be true. But here we are—weeks later—and I’m pleasantly surprised.  

**A Smart, Thoughtful Design**  
The design of this laundry stain remover spray is straightforward yet highly effective. Each bottle, with its ergonomic spray top, makes application smooth and comfortable. The 12 fl oz size is compact enough for easy storage but packs enough product for frequent use. And since it comes in a 3-pack, I’ve been able to leave a bottle near the laundry, one in the kitchen, and one in the camper for those unexpected messes during road trips. 

[Check OxiClean 757037400005 Max Force price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0bvy2xkjx/)  

**A Stain-Fighting Powerhouse**  
Let’s talk features that made me keep reaching for this product. It claims to conquer set-in stains, and boy, does it deliver! From pizza grease on my favorite T-shirt to ground-in dirt on my kid’s soccer uniform, this spray has consistently worked its magic. What particularly stands out is its versatility—it’s a hero against oil, ink, blood, makeup, and even wine stains (trust me, I tested this one personally after a clumsy evening with friends). Just spray until the fabric is saturated, let it sit for 5 minutes to 7 days (depending on how lazy you feel), and pop it into the wash. OxiClean’s formula is also dye-free and chlorine-free, so I’ve felt comfortable using it on my toddler’s colorful outfits without worry.  

**Convenience That Fits My Lifestyle**  
Life gets busy, and I can’t always tackle stains immediately. This product fits perfectly into a hectic schedule because it keeps stains from setting even after days. I’ve sprayed stains and forgotten about them until laundry day (oops), yet the results were still impressive. Whether it’s ketchup on an apron or grass stains on jeans, this flexibility has saved plenty of clothes from the ‘donate’ pile.  

**Perks**  
- Adaptable for instant or delayed washing, up to seven days.  
- Tough on the most stubborn and varied of stains (even ones I thought were permanent).  
- Suitable for whites and color fabrics alike, making life easier for parents or anyone dealing with the wrath of spaghetti night.  

**Aroma and Texture**  
The floral scent was a pleasant surprise—soft and not overly chemical-like, which is a win for those sensitive to strong smells. The liquid sprays evenly, soaking into the fabric without any sticky residue. After washing, I didn’t notice any lingering smell or odd texture. Just fresh-smelling, clean clothes every time.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
I’ve loved using this spray, but not everything is sunshine and rainbows. A couple of things could be better:  
- The spray nozzle sometimes clogs slightly after prolonged use, which means wiping it down occasionally to keep it efficient.  
- For particularly large stains, I found that I had to reapply and repeat the process to ensure the spot was gone completely.  

**Competing Products**  
How does it fare against its market rivals, you ask? I’ve used Shout Advanced Gel before, and while it does well with small, fresh stains, it doesn’t seem to handle older, stubborn messes nearly as effectively. Spray ‘n Wash Max is another contender but tends to have a more chemical-heavy scent, which some might find unpleasant. With this product, the dye-free, chlorine-free formula feels safer for family use, and its delayed washing flexibility is unmatched. Still, if fragrance-free is a top concern, you might explore alternatives.  

**Price Worthiness**  
The price point felt reasonable for the level of performance offered. Getting three bottles in a pack means I’m stocked for months, offering great value. Considering the fact that I don’t need as many laundry re-dos or keep replacing ruined clothing, it saves money in the long run. For a product that tackles stains as diverse as ink to grass (and keeps them from coming back), it’s worth every drop.

on instagram and i became really suspicious about it and thought i would ask about my doubts to Jake. 

So i confronted Jake about my concerns and he admitted that he was texting her and asked me is it bothering me and are you angry? I said that i am not angry and told him i showed her profile only because of our friendship. (Jake is a type of guy who keeps his relationships private from friends )

He said that he was sorry and he will unfollow her right away and stop talking to her.
He begged me for forgiveness and asked me not to end our friendship because of a foolishness he did.

This piece wasn’t written by a doctor, and I don’t play one on the internet. I promise this is worth your time and consideration. If it's too long, or if you prefer to continue with a traditional ADT regimen, scroll on by. But if you're interested in a credible alternative, far less damaging and arguably more effective in suppression of testosterone, grab a cuppa and read on.

What follows is the product of obsessive late-night research, cross-referenced trials, and a healthy dose of lived experience, not a medical degree. But the evidence is compelling, the logic is sound, and the questions it raises are too important to leave to white coats and drug reps alone. Sometimes it takes a patient to say what the system won’t.

Some of you are already bitching about the length of this essay. You’ve got two tabs open, a short attention span, and an inbox full of nonsense. But suck it up, buttercups. This isn’t a listicle on “10 Ways to Fight Prostate Cancer with Kale and Positive Vibes.” This is about your spine, your sanity, and maybe your life. Because the way we’ve been treating prostate cancer, especially with the holy doctrine of androgen deprivation therapy, is overdue for a serious, unflinching rethink. So grab a coffee, put on your big-boy pants (the ones that still fit after ADT weight gain), and read on. It’s too important to ignore.

***From the Oncology Underground By a Modern Eunuch in Revolt***

Let’s get this out of the way up front: I’m not a conspiracy theorist. I don’t believe in miracle cures, alkaline diets, or the healing power of beetroot smoothies. Anyone suggesting I inhale hydrogen peroxide or eat apricot kernels gets blocked faster than my urethra after radiation. But that doesn’t mean I’ve lost the capacity for skepticism, particularly when it comes to the pharmaceutical sanctification of Androgen Deprivation Therapy.

Because while ADT is the gospel according to oncology, there’s compelling evidence that safer, equally effective, and far less miserable alternatives, like transdermal estradiol, are being ignored not because they don’t work, but because they don’t pay.

So let’s ask the question that shouldn’t be heretical but is: How exactly did this chemically castrating poison become medical dogma, and what happens if we dare question it? And so it begins. You’ve been handed the golden ticket of prostate cancer; Gleason-whatever, high PSA, a PET scan that says your pelvis is now cohabiting with something you didn’t invite.

Cue the standard medical shrug: Androgen Deprivation Therapy, sir. Firmagon, Lupron, take your pick—we’ll kill your testosterone, and with it, your sex life, bone density, and probably your will to live. But we’ll add a pamphlet about osteoporosis, and if you’re lucky, a support group with muffins.

But here’s the question no one seems to ask in the fluorescent glare of the urology dungeon: Is ADT actually optimal? Or is it just the default because that’s what Big Pharma built its throne on?

Because if we take off the white coat blinders, we have to admit something deeply uncomfortable: ADT is a temporary ceasefire. Not a cure. Not even a peace treaty. Just biochemical trench warfare. Eventually, no matter how low you drive that testosterone, the tumor adapts. It mutates, multiplies, and graduates into the elite class: castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is just oncology’s way of saying, Congratulations, your cancer now comes with a superpower.

So let’s be honest: If we know that all ADT does is buy time, why are we treating it like salvation instead of a ticking clock? And if the clock is ticking, maybe it’s time to look at other hands on the dial.

Enter estrogen. Yes, that estrogen, the hormone your doctor probably only mentions when warning you about growing breasts or sobbing during commercials. But here’s the heretical twist: Estradiol might just be a better long-term strategy.

Dr. Richard Wassersug, biologist, prostate cancer survivor, and one of the few men willing to say “I wear a patch and I feel better”, has been waving the estrogen flag for years. His research, and that of others, shows that transdermal estradiol (that’s a patch, boys) can suppress testosterone just as effectively as LHRH drugs without wrecking your bones, brain, and cholesterol in the process. Oh, and bonus: it might also have direct anti-tumor effects.

Let that sink in. The drug that’s been vilified for “feminizing” men might actually extend your life and improve its quality, without requiring Zoladex-induced zombification. You’d think that would merit some attention, right? Wrong.

***Why are estrogen patches not part of the usual considerations?***

Because here’s the uncomfortable, and thoroughly evidence-based, truth: estradiol doesn’t fit the prevailing economic model of prostate cancer care. There’s no high-margin, patent-protected injectable. No quarterly depot shots are billed at thousands of dollars per visit. Estradiol patches? They're generic. Inexpensive. Available at most pharmacies. And their mechanism is well-understood; they suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis just as effectively as LHRH analogs, sometimes more so, and with fewer adverse systemic effects.

This isn’t a conspiracy; it’s a structural inertia problem. Modern oncology operates within a framework shaped by regulatory approval pathways, treatment guidelines, and, yes, pharmaceutical influence. When a therapy like transdermal estradiol falls outside the familiar protocol, even if the data supports its safety and efficacy, it tends to be sidelined. Not because it's dangerous or unproven, but because it's unfamiliar, under-promoted, and doesn’t align with the current revenue model. The excuses offered, “not standard of care,” “needs more trials,” “might confuse patients,” often serve as placeholders for institutional caution, not clinical inadequacy.

***What Oncologists will say***

Let’s anticipate the reflexive defense from the standard-bearers of ADT: “We follow evidence-based guidelines. Estradiol isn’t standard of care. It’s not widely adopted for a reason.” On the surface, this sounds reasonable; clinical conservatism masquerading as prudence. But scratch just a bit deeper, and the veneer starts to crack.

First: “Not standard of care” is not the same as “not supported by evidence.” The STAMPEDE trial, one of the largest and most respected prostate cancer studies to date, included transdermal estradiol as a primary therapy arm and found it non-inferior to LHRH agonists in terms of cancer control, with fewer cardiovascular side effects and better preservation of bone mineral density. That’s not fringe data; that’s gold-standard, peer-reviewed, multi-center clinical evidence.

Second, if the defense is “we don’t have enough data,” then one must ask: why haven’t we pursued more data? Why hasn't North America invested in follow-up trials on estrogen therapy the way it has on every tweak to enzalutamide, abiraterone, or next-gen ADT agents? The answer is painfully simple: no one makes serious money off a patch that costs less than your parking at the cancer center. That’s not a conspiracy; it’s a market disincentive, a documented barrier in drug development across all of medicine.

Third: Clinical inertia isn’t caution; it’s neglect. When credible alternatives exist, and we ignore them in favor of more toxic, more expensive options simply because “that’s how we’ve always done it,” we’re no longer practicing medicine; we’re administering orthodoxy.

And finally, let’s not pretend oncologists are uniformly up-to-date. Multiple studies (e.g., Schaffer et al., JAMA Oncology, 2017) have shown that oncologists often lag years behind evolving evidence, particularly in areas not pushed by industry marketing or guideline pressure. That’s not a character flaw; it’s a system flaw.

So, when the argument comes, and it will, that estrogen therapy isn’t “ready,” the fact-based response is: It’s been ready. You’re just not using it.

***Do cribriform patterns change the equation?***

As a result of my biopsy, cribriform patterns were detected in my tumor. Naturally, I then started researching whether that changes the equation. This is what I found:

Cribriform pattern in prostate cancer is associated with more aggressive tumor biology, higher risk of progression, and increased potential for metastasis. It’s part of why tumors with Gleason 3+4 and cribriform are considered higher risk than those without. Oncologists often respond to this with more intense androgen suppression, sometimes layering in second-line agents like abiraterone or enzalutamide earlier.

Even aggressive tumors still depend on androgen signaling, at least initially. Cribriform doesn’t negate the effectiveness of hormone suppression. It just raises the bar for how complete and sustained that suppression must be. And this is precisely where estradiol may offer an edge:

• Transdermal estradiol suppresses testosterone to castrate levels, just like Firmagon or Lupron. In some trials (e.g., STAMPEDE, Ockrim et al.), it did so more rapidly and more completely.

• Estradiol may exert direct antiproliferative effects on prostate cancer cells, including those with cribriform patterns, by interfering with cell cycle progression and modulating apoptosis pathways. This has been shown in preclinical studies and suggested in some human trials (Miller et al., BJU Int, 2004).

• Bone protection and cardiovascular stability become even more crucial in aggressive disease, where longer-term survival is possible. Estradiol helps maintain both, whereas long-term ADT exacerbates risk.

So if anything, the presence of cribriform architecture strengthens the rationale for considering transdermal estradiol, either as a primary suppressive agent or as a combined modality (e.g., adjunct to doublet therapy).

What cribriform does change is how aggressive the overall treatment strategy should be. But that doesn’t automatically make conventional ADT the best tool, it just means that whatever tool we use better be effective and sustainable. And there’s growing evidence that estradiol is both.

***The dogmatic adherence to ADT (via LHRH agonists/antagonists) is, in part, about legal liability insulation.***

Let’s break it down clinically and legally, without wandering into conspiracy territory:

Guideline Adherence = Legal Protection

In modern oncology, treatment guidelines (like NCCN, EAU, ASCO) function as both clinical roadmaps and legal shields. When an oncologist follows these standards, even if they’re outdated, conservative, or less-than-optimal, they are much harder to sue. If an adverse outcome occurs, the defense is simple: “I followed the current standard of care.”

Even if another option (like transdermal estradiol) had more favorable side effect profiles or emerging evidence, prescribing outside the guideline opens the door to accusations of “experimental treatment,” especially if the patient suffers unexpected harm.

Estradiol Isn’t Off-Label - But It’s Off-Guideline

Here’s the legal catch-22:

• Transdermal estradiol has data (e.g., STAMPEDE, Ockrim, Langley, Wassersug)

• It’s not formally off-label (it's an approved drug for hormone modulation)

• But it’s not included in North American treatment guidelines as first-line ADT

So, while it’s scientifically valid, it’s still risky from a malpractice perspective; not because it doesn’t work, but because no one wants to be the first doctor in the courtroom defending a patch instead of Lupron.

Result: Defensive Medicine Becomes Default Medicine

Rather than personalize care or explore better-tolerated, evidence-supported alternatives, oncologists fall back on: “This is what the guidelines say.” Which is another way of saying: “If this goes sideways, I can’t be blamed.”

And so estradiol, cheap, effective, and arguably less toxic, remains an outsider. Not because it lacks science, but because it lacks institutional coverage and legal backing. ADT dogma isn’t just about pharma profits or tradition. It’s reinforced by medical-legal systems that punish deviation from guidelines. Estradiol’s absence from those guidelines makes it a clinical risk, not medically, but legally. And that is part of why oncologists don’t even mention the patch: not because it’s ineffective, but because recommending it puts them in unprotected legal territory.

***What would be the potential side effects of estradiol?***

Transdermal estradiol patches, when used as hormone therapy for prostate cancer, have a generally favorable side effect profile compared to traditional androgen deprivation drugs like Lupron or Firmagon, but they are not entirely free of risks.

Among the most common side effects in men are gynecomastia (breast enlargement), which is dose-dependent and often painless, and nipple tenderness, which may feel reminiscent of a second, more cynical puberty.

Mild fluid retention can occur, occasionally causing puffiness, while skin irritation at the patch site is also possible, particularly if application sites aren’t rotated regularly. Less commonly, some men may experience venous thromboembolism (blood clots), though the risk is significantly lower than with oral estrogen because the patch bypasses first-pass liver metabolism.

Mood changes have been reported, with some men experiencing improved emotional balance, while others report irritability or low mood, though this may be hard to separate from the general psychological toll of ADT itself. Intriguingly, a few men even report increased libido, likely due to central nervous system effects or mood stabilization.

Occasional side effects like nausea or headache may surface, particularly during dose adjustments or if absorption varies. More theoretical but monitored risks include male breast cancer, which remains extremely rare and not clearly linked to estradiol patches, and liver function changes, though these are unlikely due to the non-oral route.

Importantly, some of estradiol’s most significant effects are actually benefits compared to standard ADT: it helps preserve bone mineral density, improves lipid profiles, may reduce cardiovascular risk, and is often associated with fewer or less intense hot flashes, as well as improved cognitive and mood stability. So while estradiol is not without its side effects, its risk-benefit profile, particularly in comparison to LHRH-based ADT, makes it a serious and often under-discussed therapeutic alternative for men with prostate cancer.

***The Only Conclusion***

The studies exist. The STAMPEDE trial, among others, has demonstrated that estradiol is not only effective for androgen suppression but may also offer advantages in cardiovascular and bone health. Researchers like Dr. Richard Wassersug have long documented its viability and pushed for serious re-evaluation of its role in both primary and adjunct therapy.

This isn’t about rejecting science. It’s about following all the science, even the parts that don’t come with glossy brochures or sales reps. But what if there is?

What if we looked at estrogen not just as a quaint adjunct to ADT, some delicate patch to smooth out hot flashes, but as a primary weapon in our arsenal? What if we asked: Can we delay resistance, slow progression, maybe even avoid CRPC altogether by switching hormonal gears? What if we’re fighting on the wrong hormonal axis entirely?

And yes, these are questions, not guarantees. Estrogen isn’t a magic bullet. But neither is ADT, unless you count the one aimed at your libido, your bones, and your sanity. At least estrogen offers a potential path that doesn’t require you to die in a haze of brittle bones and blank stares.

So maybe it’s time for a new conversation. One where oncologists don’t just follow the guideline algorithms like rats in a maze but actually question the premise: Why are we treating prostate cancer with a strategy we know will fail eventually, while ignoring one that might fail less catastrophically?

Men deserve better. They deserve honesty. They deserve options that aren’t shaped by market share and injection schedules. Because in the end, this isn’t about choosing between ADT and estrogen. It’s about choosing between inevitability and possibility. And personally, I’ll take my chances with the patch. At least it doesn’t come with a quarterly rebate program.

**A Stylish and Space-Saving Design**  
The Waterdrop WD-WFD-40L Slim Water Filter Dispenser immediately caught my eye with its sleek and modern design. Measuring just 14.4 x 5.5 x 10.2 inches, it’s crafted to maximize refrigerator space, which is always at a premium in my household. I was particularly impressed by how the slim profile of the dispenser fit neatly into my fridge alongside juice cartons and leftovers without crowding the shelves. Its 35-cup capacity (19 cups contained in the main body) is a practical feature, ensuring there’s plenty of water for daily use, whether it’s hydrating on a hot day or filling up the coffee maker.  

[Time to see Waterdrop WD-WFD-40L cost on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b09q8hdvrz/)  

**User-Friendly Features That Stand Out**  
What I loved about this water filter dispenser was its thoughtfully designed user-friendly features. The top handle makes lifting and carrying it to the sink less of a chore, particularly when you’re refilling in a hurry. Meanwhile, the sliding lid is both practical and hygienic, shielding the water from fridge odors while still being easy to pop open and use. An intelligent filter replacement indicator? Yes, please! Thanks to this little marvel, I never had to guess when the filter needed changing—it’s a lifesaver for forgetful folks like me.  

**Impressive Filtration Performance**  
In terms of performance, the Waterdrop filter system is NSF42 & 372 certified, a reassuring certification for those of us who are particular about water quality. Testing revealed it reduces chlorine by up to 97.4%, thanks to its high-quality carbon fiber filter. Knowing that the system removes odors, metals, and impurities like calcium and mercury gave peace of mind every time I filled a glass. My family noted an immediate improvement in taste—it genuinely seemed fresher and smoother. However, I need to point out that this system doesn’t lower the TDS value; if that’s essential to you, an RO system might be a better option.  

**Durability and Lifespan**  
One feature that drastically sets this filter apart from competitors is its four times faster flow rate and five times longer lifespan. The replacement filters last an impressive 200 gallons or about two months, reducing the constant hassle of swapping filters—something I’ve begrudgingly dealt with using other brands. The time-saving aspect, coupled with effective filtration, is a win for any busy household.  

### **Advantages**  
- Slim and compact design perfect for refrigerators.  
- Practical features like a handle and sliding cover make usage hassle-free.  
- NSF-certified filtration ensures cleaner, safer water.  
- Long filter lifespan (200 gallons/2 months) adds convenience.  

### **Pitfalls**  
- Does not reduce TDS value, limiting its appeal for some users.  
- Filling the entire 35-cup capacity can take a few extra minutes.  

**Safety and Materials**  
I’ve often worried about the materials used for water dispensers, but this filter checks all the safety boxes. It’s made of food-grade, lead-free, and BPA-free materials, providing confidence that no harmful substances are leaching into the water. This eco-conscious design coupled with its eco-friendly packaging adds an ethical layer to its appeal.  

**Competing Products**  
When compared to industry giants like Brita and PUR, this dispenser stands out with its filter lifespan and faster flow rate. Brita, for instance, is often criticized for slow filtration, and its filters typically last fewer gallons. On the other hand, Waterdrop delivers superior performance in a sleek package, although Brita and PUR might still be preferable for those desiring lower TDS levels. Each choice has its pros and cons, but for everyday filtering needs, this one ticks more boxes for me.  

**Quality for Price**  
Is this product worth it? For its smart design, reliable filtration, and durability, it provides excellent bang for your buck. While slightly pricier at face value compared to some traditional pitchers, the combination of an extended filter life and thoughtful features helps it stand out in the long term. Its efficiency and ease of use make it a great investment for families who prioritize clean water on demand.

You know how some people (Elderly to be more specific) like the taste of coffee, but refrain from consuming it in later hours because it “Keeps them up”. We created decaf coffee for this very reason. But yet, no one has done decaf energy drinks. Ones that keep the flavour, subtract the caffeine. You’ve ever heard of the Placebo effect? It’s a psychosis (Lack of a better word) where someone takes a pill for example with nothing in it, but yet they feel cured of their burden.

I've listened and finished a couple of LitRPG series, and of course made a tier list of them. Now I'm looking for something new that is different than what I have already read. I will continue to read these series as they come out as I do really enjoy them.

I really liked Heretical Fishing because of how the main character did have some abilities and leveling in crafting objects, and most likely because of my love of coffee and fishing. I like DCC for the system AI. I really enjoyed how he has ""free will"" to kind of do what he wants and the AI works itself into anything the crawlers do. I really like how The Good Guys and The Bad Guys series cross over each other later on, I would not mind finding another author that does this with their books. 

The reason I ranked HWFWM so low, even though its a good story, is because I feel like the writing is a little wordy. Although this has gotten better in the later books. There is a lot of repeating of info and a lot of iron-rank this and silver-rank that and gold-rankers rule. (Praying for a speedy recovery!) 

Specifically, I'd love to find a series where the main character isn't overpowered and actually has to struggle and work for their progress. I'm particularly interested in stories with a strong emphasis on either **crafting** (items, spells, alchemy, or even base/town building), **collecting** (items, trophies, boss kills, coin, artifacts), or **exploration**.

I want to also mention, my To Be Read books, I already own. I just need to get around to reading them. Typically I also read a lot of Military books written in first hand accounts if this info helps any.

Any suggestions that fit this? Thanks in advance!

One Last Thing - Why My Tier List Looks Unique: If you're wondering why my tier list format is a bit different from the usual Tiermaker style, it's because, frankly, I hated the tiermaker website. I found it slow, overloaded with ads that even my ad blocker struggled with, and just generally a pain to use. Plus, the final image wasn't always easy to read on a phone or if you weren't familiar with every cover.

So, I took a bit of a detour, wasted to much time, and built my own tier list website. It's designed to be more user-friendly, feature rich, ad-free, and allows anyone to add books for the community to rank. Feel free to give it a try. The link is at the bottom of my tier list if you fancy.

Eager to wake up each morning, actually noticing the beauty in the sunlight as it begins to make the walls glow around me as I make coffee for me and my partner. It's been a while. 



Maybe it’s the same for everyone else. The same feeling of frustration and just blah. Going through the motions but not experiencing. The absolute breathtaking leaps of joy in life. The depths of despair that are possible. I’ve always said this - you can’t experience the highest highs, without having already experienced the lowest lows. Without struggle, adversity, what does it matter if you win? In order to succeed we need to know what it’s like to lose. We need to feel it so that we can fear it. So that we can remember what it’s like and how utterly painful it feels. Putting ourselves then to the test of how far and hard we will push to not feel it ever again. 



I find for me at least, that when I struggle is when I find my spirituality again. Like greeting an old soulmate, in an instant remembering who they were, who they always will be. Mornings, and afternoons, and nights spent together, uncovering. “Oh, it’s you.” I feel each and every time. I'm searching a bit for it but I don't feel that right now.



Seven years ago I was experiencing the most insane upheaval of my life. In every single way - mentally, emotionally, spiritually, physically - my world was kicking me out of it. Absolutely screaming at me that I needed to sprout wings and fly, fast and far, out of the life I was living. 



So I did. I threw up my hands, howled at the moon, and simultaneously laughed and cried my way through packing up everything I owned and starting over while my friends settled into their marriages and pregnancies. I’ve never felt more rattled to the bone, yet intensely, finally, myself. I was free, but who was I? I loved the time when I finally gave myself the space to figure it out. 



That was my biggest life upheaval, but it seems to be a bit of a pattern for me. Is there anyone out there who has lived a full, long, even-keeled life? Is it even possible? Is peace boring? Is equilibrium when the party stops? When it feels a little like it does now, just opaque. Hazy. Is that why I'm feeling this way? I usually feel bursts of gratitude throughout my day, sharp and in my heart. I haven't in a while. I'm just not noticing things the way I usually do. 



I'm curious where others are in their own journey. Because I’m not somewhere that feels really low and difficult even though I am stressed out and desperately burnt out. I'm just meh. People everywhere seem to be struggling. I used to read posts about this and just kind of glaze over them. Not understanding because I used to not really feel that way. But now I get it.

1ktv9aw,https://i.redd.it/i2jd2ullol2f1.jpeg,Roller Pro VS B&R Baseline Global VS a surprise budget option,"**The Gist**

As promised I've done a comprehensive comparison of both the Peak Design and Briggs & Riley Rollers, with pictures and measurements as well as a bunch of questions I and others may have had. 

*For the TL;DR folks though*:

Both are at odds with each other on most points, the PD excells in features and gimmicks while the B&R is an overall tried and true tank of a roller. 

If you're iffy about the price consider a cheaper alternative, especially if you only need a carry-on for clothing and essential travel items, you'll also save a lot of weight. 

If you maily want the best built piece of luggage for clothing and essentials, no matter the cost and weight, the B&R is your buy.

For transporting only camera gear (especially when not flying) a dedicated case like a Pelican or Nanuk (which I personally prefer) offers more protection, but the Roller obviously offers more features and thus versatility.

So for everybody else who either wants a premium carry-on or a jack-of-all-trades piece of gear/equipment and also doesn't mind shelling out a considerable amount of money, we're in the PD Subreddit and we like to get what we pay for, so on to the comparisons and review:

  
**General outside overview**

Both the B&R as well as the PD Rollers have a distinctive style. 

The B&R is definately a bit more understated and only really shows how well made it is when you get a closer look or touch it. 

The PD is a very... PD design. Futuristic, sleek, very obviously akin to modern ""tech commuter"" soft goods but also not loud like a Tumi, meaning that it's, just like the B&R, very much an IFYKYK item. 

I like that on both, no need to get the bag stolen for its inherent value alone, although the B&R does give off a more professional look with its unapologetically square silhouette.

[https://imgur.com/a/xZF0f3R](https://imgur.com/a/xZF0f3R)

The materials are also exceptional on each.

 PD really, *REALLY* releived me when i saw that the outside wasn't only smoother and better sealed than the Travel Backpack (which i can't for the life of me get clean, I've tried EVERYTHING) but also more so than the bottom of the 35L duffel, which I was hoping to be the texture the Roller Pro will have. Sure, it can peel one day, but it's just so sleek and dirt repellant. Perfect as expected, PD really did put all their experience into this piece of luggage.

The B&R has a wildly different finish. The ""ballistic nylon"" really stands up to its name here, even though I yawn every time I hear or read that term. It's so rugged and well-made feeling that touching it instantly makes you aware of the roller's price. It's just that premium. And it also holds up *extremely* well to wear and tear, my Large Baseline Spinner (identical to the carry-on in every way save for size) looks almost brand new and it's a checked piece of luggage that has seen some true abuse over its many airmiles.

While the PD has a complee shell beneath the soft outer, the B&R has a partial rigid shell beneath as well making it far more rigid than other soft cases. But also puts it at odds with PD in terms of weight, both clocking in at 4.2 kg weighed with two different scales. 

It's also worth noting that the B&R has classic bumpers at the corners to protect it from wear while the PD forgoes almost any besides some on the back for laying it flat. But only time willt tell how it will hold up, I'm sure it'll be fine unless people gate-check it too regularly.

The outside zippers on both bags are also quite different.

Many a long time PD customer will know how getting to the current zips has been an odyssey of torn tracks and dislocated pulls, I haven't had an issue with the most recent iteration yet and am quite comfortable trusting my gear to them. They are aquaguarded as usual and we only find three tracks on the outside, one for expanding the Roller Pro, one for the laptop compartment and one for opening the case itself. *I really wish the laptop compartment had two pulls though.*

The B&R zippers are a different approach. They don't have dedicated aquaguarding (although I have never seen a drop of water get in even in really inclement weather) but are way burlier while still being a dream to zip open or close. Just feels like quility you know? Comparing them to the PD zips on the Roller is like comparing a tank to a jet, two different approaches for the same explosive outcome. A more fitting comparison would be the bigger zip on the Travel Backpack 45L. The two smaller pockets on the B&R use zippers closer to the PD Roller. The expansion on the B&R is achieved with a rigid rail system.

Both bags have lockable zips, although the B&R does come with a travel lock while PD leaves the use of one up to the customer.

More on expansion and pockets further below...



Both cases measure quite differently though, which is immediately apparent when looking at them.

The B&R is wider, the PD slightly taller deeper overall, even including the handle on the outside of the B&R. This allows the B&R to fit more strict airline requirements like Air france easier, especially if they take measurements at the luggage check scale where they will almost always forgo the handls. Smart play B&R. But let's not kid ourselves, how often is carry-on size and weight inspected anyway? ...I'll go into more detail on the inside measurements later on.

PD outside measurements: 55.9x35.6x22.9 cm/ 22x14x9-11 in

B&R outside measurements: 53.3x38.1x22.9-29.2 cm/ 21x15x9-11.5 in



Both also feature Handles on the top, sides and bottom while the B&R forgoes a handle on its right side ( a feature its bigger siblings have) the PD has handles on all sides.

The B&R top handle is a thick leather-wrapped padded self-retracting handle while its side and bottom handles are padded and made from the same nylon as the rest of its construction.

The PD top handle is basically the Every day Backpack V2 handle. I like it, some hate it, but it's completely fine and I really adore the feel of the fabric. Its side handles are the same, the bottom handle is the same flat, hand cutting Travel 45L handle that luckily will get little use but man do i wish it had a bit more space between it and the suitcase.

*Now to a star of the show -* the Slim Drive trolley handle

Both rollers, of course, have trolley handles.

  
[https://imgur.com/a/5oPbUD7](https://imgur.com/a/5oPbUD7)

But Peak Design took it upon themselves to make theirs a standout feature from the competition. The Slim Drive is sleek, slim, wobbles a biiiiit less than the B&R and really feels great to extend. I was skeptical at first, as the marketing made it seem completely rigid, but PD employs engineers and engineers know that some wobble compensates for the forces exerted when pushing, pulling and otherwise jerking around luggage. Carbon Fiber isn't magic, but right use of it can make it feel like it. Example: this handle. The space saving on the interior is also an added bonus and an interesting approach that B&R solved by just giving up on it and exiling the thing to the outside.

I do however have some issues with it. They may probably be me-problems but they can also be dealbreakers, and would have been if I had known/paid attention...

The Slim Drive is short(er). Due to it being a solid piece and not segmented its length is limited to the height of the Roller Pro at most, making it just shy of where I can pull the PD roller behind myself on two wheels, but I am 6'6"" tall and it's not going to be an issue for most customers, just be aware of the fact. The Slim, Drive also has only one shorter adjustment before collapsing, but considering it's not that tall that really won't be an issue unless you are very particularly small. THe handle grip itself is nice, I really like the machined aluminum button which feels great and better than the B&R's.

  
The B&R has a more classic telescoping handle that is quirkily attached to its back, hance the namesake Outsider Handle.

It has a grooved shape that lends it excellent stability and it barely wobbles more than the PD handle front to back and a bit more side to side, but considering the price of the case I'd expect no less. It's also considerably taller due to its telescoping nature, at about 11cm/4.5 inches taller than the PD handle fully extended. It also has four stops of adjustment, which is nice I guess. The button on the B&R is made of aluminum as well, although it's wobbly and thus feels noticably less premium than the PD, the grip itself is just as good though.

In a perfect world I'd have a longer slimdrive with the outside attachment but unless PD buys up B&R we won't be getting that crossover soon enough. Neither Roller wins here although if I had known about the PD's shortcoming (hehe pun intended) I might not have gotten it in the first place, even in the face of me being a PD fan that owns *a lot* of their stuff and loves most of it. Like the 25L Outdoor Backpack it just doesn't fit my bigass.

PD max. total length: 1m/100cm

PD min. total length: 90cm

B&R max. total length: 1m 11cm/111cm

B&R min. total length: 92cm

Lastly, outside of PD trying to reinvent the wheel on trolley handles they weren't on a roll with the spinners.

Bad puns aside, the wheels on the Rolly Proly are *fine*. But they aren't the best, nor the worst. Just fine. 

I appreciate the larger size compared to the B&R carry-on, they are much closer in size to the B&R checked spinner I own, but while PD's homebrew solution rolls well, seems to be able to hold up pretty well in the long run due to the material choices and really doesn't have any negatives to point out--

\--the B&R rollers roll better than the PD ones even though they are smaller, slimmer and beat up over time.

  
Now, don't think this is a bad thing, I believe the PD spinners will be more durable in general and they are truly great, just when put up head to head with another piece of luggage at this price point they are at a tie. That's good! 

PD's engineers managed to make the premiere point of failure, frustration and need for parts on their first piece of luggage equal to a brand that has had quite some time to perfect its craft.m That's peak design by Peak Design.

**Now** ***before*** **we get into the nitty gritty interiors of our two fourwheelers...**

**Exterior feature overview**

We all know and love, well I know and love, PD's exterior carry solutions.

I'll keep this one simple, it's great, works the same as on any PD bag when it comes to strapping stuff to the Roller Prom and every piece of luggage that has a similar system is instantly more practical than the next.

[https://imgur.com/a/2UQjaY4](https://imgur.com/a/2UQjaY4)

Just don't expect the included elastic straps to hold heavy things to the side without slippage.

[https://imgur.com/a/gifhSEj](https://imgur.com/a/gifhSEj)

The front laptop compartment is decent as well, it holds a 16"" macbook pro or any similar sied laptop with ease and has two little pockets bordering a larger one reminiscent of the Every Day Backpack laptop compartment pockets. I hate them.  Same as with the EDB they feel premium, the fabric is even better and feels more resilient, but they intrude on interior space as they share it with the lid volume and putting pointy things in them also makes me afraid I'll puncture the thin weaved elastic. It'll take quite some trips to see if they wear out like the EDB ones but otherwise they are what they are. My biggest gripe is the color, a pen leaking or any hint of something else getting saucy in there will scar the quick access for life.

[https://imgur.com/a/Pr2aFdq](https://imgur.com/a/Pr2aFdq)

Getting on to the laptop compartments main feature, or gimmick, the Gear Tent: I like it a lot. I wish the EDB had it, (V3 when?) and the magnetic closure seperating it from the quick access pockets is ingenius. I appreciate the brainstorming that went into this part of the case, think it's a bit lost on a piece of luggage but I'm sure PD will implement it into their future lines soon enough. The compartment needs a second zipper though. Please.

[https://imgur.com/a/rAUERl3](https://imgur.com/a/rAUERl3)



The B&R has a more luggage and less tech centric approach. 

It has an external carry strap for bags that can be daisy-chained with a larger B&R roller and thus allow for four bags to be rolled simoultaneously. Like a luggage centipede.

[https://imgur.com/a/XZtecqx](https://imgur.com/a/XZtecqx)

[https://imgur.com/a/WPm45z3](https://imgur.com/a/WPm45z3)

The large front pocket is great for stowing a thin jacket, a laptop *in a sleeve* (safety first) or other items. It's.nothing special, just a zipped pocket. BUT it can be locked more easily due to the duela zipper pulls while the PD has the fenangly safety zipper loop that the EDB or Travel Backpack has (you shouldn't leave valuables unattended like that anyway, but convenience is convenience).

[https://imgur.com/a/KVjdt1m](https://imgur.com/a/KVjdt1m)

ABove the large compartment is B&R's Speed Thru pocket, an orange lined pocket to hold things that need to be ready at hand. It's high-vis inside, and stands out when left open by accident. This is not lockable though, so while intended for passports they seem to be banking on its incognito nature (?) and that it's used often enough to be supervised, I guess. Weird. But I appreciate the extra smaller pocket anyway.

[https://imgur.com/a/3Vb1U95](https://imgur.com/a/3Vb1U95)

On its rear, nestled between the rails of the trolley handle is one of my favorite things ever. A powerank pouch to charge your devices without opening up any bag. It has ample space for large powerbanks and a cable passthrough, as well as little pockets to just quickly stow stuff or a phone. This is also where the B&R name tag is located, more on those in just a bit.

[https://imgur.com/a/2iDvxLA](https://imgur.com/a/2iDvxLA)

  
The last feature of both, if you can call it that, are the nametags. 

The PD name tag is removable, small, unintrusive and made of their signature hypelon with a sort of writable surface inside. I like it, but I also don't love it on luggage, I will probably add it to a backpack and swap it for a bigger one because I like to be able to slot in a business card into mine.

[https://imgur.com/a/j48S9Uv](https://imgur.com/a/j48S9Uv)



The B&R tag has evolved into a retractible tab with business card sizing. Older B&R luggage and bags still had hanging tags but the larger leather tags get snagged on things so they iterated to a better solution. It can't be taken off, but does it need to be?

[https://imgur.com/a/LdLkGNl](https://imgur.com/a/LdLkGNl)

  
**Now let's dive indoors the bowels of these little beasts**

**General interior overview**

  
On first glance the interiors of the cases bear none but the most rudimentary similarities.

[https://imgur.com/a/ClAGnCX](https://imgur.com/a/ClAGnCX)

  
What is immediately noticeable is the drawbridge style opening on the PD, preventing the lid from flopping over, while the B&R has the coveted lid, but no rigid hinge or strings keeping it upright. I really love this on the PD case.

The interior lining on the B&R is also a bit more of the classic suitcase liner, with better materials overall but still just fabric. It's also possible to be removed and washed.

[https://imgur.com/a/Yq89Wg2](https://imgur.com/a/Yq89Wg2)

  
The PD ""car trunk style"" lining- I love, love, *love* it! the form-molded feltish shell makes it feel incredibly different from anything else and it looks like something out of StarWars. It makes the interior appear more spacious than it is by offewring a clear uncluttered view when the case is empty. It's also worth noting that the PD opens up length-wise, while the B&R opens up sideways.

[https://imgur.com/a/IUXQy72](https://imgur.com/a/IUXQy72)



The PD bag has a criss-cross elastic strap system with adjustable tension to hold down the bottom layer of packed items or clothing, the B&R has split webbing attached to elastic straps which is expandable down the middle. A smart feature is the ability to hook the shorter part of the webbing to the external carry anchor to facilitate easy packing. It's genius, but PD's system is just more sleek and unobtrusive overall. 

The only part where PD's webbing falls flat is when holding small items, the panels in the B&R don't necessitate packing cubes, the thin lines on the PD almost beg for the glory of the cube. 

Both designs are great but PD's is from the future while B&R's is tried and true.

[https://imgur.com/a/aNm8E7q](https://imgur.com/a/aNm8E7q)

[https://imgur.com/a/IUXQy72](https://imgur.com/a/IUXQy72)

  
The bag's lids are, in my humble opinion, some of the prime features of each and a good differentiator of the target audiences.

B&R's lid features two mesh pockets with mesh that feels like it belongs in a bag of its price class, but they're just mesh in the end. The true gem is the trifold garment bag in the lid. It folds outand can hold a (spare) shirt or coat or dress, can be shortened and has a spot for a hanger as well. I use it regularly on the larger checked suitcase and my suit never gets beat up. Due to the Carry on being quite small and me being not so at all I can't comfortably fit an entire suit in its compartment, but a jacket and a shirt fit quite well and it will keep a pair of slacks in wrinkle free fresh pressed condition.

[https://imgur.com/a/95c6V35](https://imgur.com/a/95c6V35)



Now to the heart of our Proller, the lid system PD designed is awesome. It's transparent fabric pockets are something I've enjoyed on my Tasmanian Tiger 11L backpack ( [https://imgur.com/a/JJOD629](https://imgur.com/a/JJOD629) ) and wished the EDB had. FUn fact: TT sells velcro zippered pouches with the same style of front that I've been using as small item storage velcro'd to the inside of my EDB for years! The way the panel rolls down to reveal space behind it or allow taller packing in the main compartment akin to the 45L TBP is also neat, with a hidden tiny pocket and a seeecret messaaage hidden there as well. I see myself using this for a thin jacket that I need access to or a book and tablet. It's well thought out and differentiates the PD as a tech freindly modern traveller item from the B&R's business first approach.

The PD roller also has a dedicated Airtag compartment (can't wait for the V3 EDB to have one *wink wink*) while the B&R has the ability to add an Airtag almost anywhere in its side lining because a zipper circles its border.

[https://imgur.com/a/1zV0zkY](https://imgur.com/a/1zV0zkY)

  
Speaking of the secret message, both bags have a cute and friendly blurb/easter egg hidden inside them, the PD has it behind the lid panel, the B&R inside the outer compartment.

[https://imgur.com/a/mHaNbBL](https://imgur.com/a/mHaNbBL)

[https://imgur.com/a/CTvIwBc](https://imgur.com/a/CTvIwBc)

  
**Now to expand upon the packing volume of these bags**

**Volume and expansion overview**

The PD Rollproler is approximately 15.5cm deep, while the B&R offers a bit more depth.

[https://imgur.com/a/tlW3NFn](https://imgur.com/a/tlW3NFn)

  
The PD's handle hump is only 1.35cm tall on the inside, while the B&R is completely flat all the way through.

[https://imgur.com/a/2YHbYeb](https://imgur.com/a/2YHbYeb)

  
The expanded depth of the PD is about 18cm, that of the B&R is far deeper.

[https://imgur.com/a/nEzErAI](https://imgur.com/a/nEzErAI)

The B&R expansion system works by using two rails at the top and bottom of the roller and is rigid, meaning it will stay expanded even if it isn't packed fully. They collapsed by pushing them down and are ratcheted so they are solid in all expansion depths. The PD RP on the other hand uses a classic ""unzip my flap"" zipper that allows a fabric flap to offer expansion by releiving its compression from the zipper. This means that it offers considerable less expansion and is more of a compression tool when zipping the lid shut.

It's not a real bother but the B&R system is the best I've ever used and it makes me wish the Roller Pro had is as well, but beggars can't be choosers and although it costs the PD some volume it doesn't take away from the case overall.

  
The space inside the two pieces of luggage is comparable, the B&R offers far more volume and in its unexpanded unexpanded form.

PD vol: 34-39L (couldn't find the interior dimensions in a pinch)

B&R vol. 37-49L; 19x15x7.875 in/ 48.26x38x20 cm interior

To show how they can and can't pack I've taken some exemplary pictures with PD packing and camera cubes:

[https://imgur.com/a/OyYnCkX](https://imgur.com/a/OyYnCkX)

[https://imgur.com/a/73ziv4j](https://imgur.com/a/73ziv4j)

Note that the Large Camera Cube is really space-inefficient as it takes it all up but offers lkess storage than the XL Camera Cube. If you own a 45L TBP I'd recommend getting the Large cube for compatibility, if you don't and aren't planning to get one get the XL only if you want nothing else in the case.

[https://imgur.com/a/lBWK79c](https://imgur.com/a/lBWK79c)

I personally use Nanuk 935 cases for camera gear. They are carry-on sized but most importantly completely waterproof albeit devilishly heavy when packed out with glass and flashes. But it's a PD product so it needs the camera gear aspect.

I think I might get a Smedium Cube to save some space in the roller for clothing on weekend trips, which would allow me to add a 935 with equipment as an extra for anything non-airline travel related...

Don't forget that you can bring the valuable gear as a personal item on the plane! Never risk getting camera gear gate-checked! (see the ProTip in PD's Roller Pro video about swapping the cube for the backpack ;) )

You can of course also add a camera cube to the B&R, although it feels wrong to do so.

[https://imgur.com/a/73ziv4j](https://imgur.com/a/73ziv4j)

  
**Now if you're going to bring a backpack...**

**Backpack compatibility**

Adding a backpack to the handle seems like something that is taken for granted, yet the luggage passthroughs on PD backpacks have given me such grief over the years I will have to go on a little rant.

First of all, the sideways passtrhough. I, and many others, don't pack for a sideways oriantation. I walk upright, don't fly like superman and only use two appendages for running. It's unintuitive and causes the bottle holders to lose bottles, god forbid your coffee thermous isn't completely tight, all that beautiful grey fabric in the EDB *will get saucy.* But it's the card we've been dealt so here are the 45L and EDB on the Roller Pro:

[https://imgur.com/a/SiyebhN](https://imgur.com/a/SiyebhN)

The issue with the 45L is that the wide portion on top is prone to causing tumbles by poor weight distribution.

It gets WORSE with the EDB, the passthrough is somlarge it tends to tilt off to the sides causing everything to tip over, or worse, contents (and coffee) to be ejected out of the EDB. It's not an issue on bigger suitcases but on carr-on roller it's inexcusable. Can't wait for the V3 EDB to fix this ';)

[https://imgur.com/a/tYeeQjg](https://imgur.com/a/tYeeQjg)

I also added my daily driver backpack and a briefcase/computer bag as a comparison to how I think it should be done and for the aesthetic of a non-PD bag on the Roller (It's a B&R Medium Cargo Backpack if anybody is curious).

[https://imgur.com/a/5sqAIvH](https://imgur.com/a/5sqAIvH)

The PD Slings are also a great compliment to the Roller, although only my 10L fits over the handle comfortably while the 6 and 3 L need to be hung from the straps.

  
**Now to another main event: WARRANTY**

[https://imgur.com/a/04oxHVC](https://imgur.com/a/04oxHVC)

  
It's what we value most besides innovation and features, the PD Guaranteed for Life label.

PD as always honors any defects and in some cases extreme wear and age for their bags and other stuff.

I've only had to claim warranty once on a phone case as the anchor tether snapped when dropping it slung around my neck, a freak accident that was resolved ASAP. Great response and easy to get in touch.

I like trusting that if my zippers do fail I'll get a repair or a new bag/pouch/whatever, and the community has been as far as I can see very satisfied.

As it stands and I've understood, the defect claim extends to the Roller Pro *but does not encompass airline inflicted damage.* This is normal for luggage companies, from Samsonite to Rimowa. Usually they will still replace parts, Samsonite for example will provide spare parts and free repairs at any authorized retailer for 10 years after purchase. So I'm not worrying about PD not replacing a roller or a zipper because they will break and who knows if it even happened by luggage handling. The usual procedure is ""don't show don't tell"". 

Now, B&R's Lifetime Guarantee is a bit different. It's lifetime as well, obviously, but they just don't care about most circumstances. The real premium about their handling of it is that they will ship replacement parts to wherever you are for self repair or enable repair at a retailer or postage to a repair center, repair even older bags and luggage *and will do so even if the damage is caused by airlines.* This is what really sets them apart, not only are their cases near indestructible, they will also fix them perpetually unless they are irrepairable, wherein you just get a new one.

Comparing this to PD where you usually get a new replacement it's different but also similar.

This makes both companies by far leaders in this aspect and since they make such reliable products they can afford to stand behind them.

You could argue that the B&R guarantee is better but considering PD's track record I don't think they are worse in any way. Both rollers are definately true buy once cry once items.

  
**I hope this comparison was helpful to some deciding on which luggage to get, but hear me out...**

**It doesn't have to be expensive**

I thought I'd throw in a little curveball and add another piece of luggage to the comparison, my **Travelite Priima**

[https://imgur.com/a/iOEzW5D](https://imgur.com/a/iOEzW5D)

First off, I love this cute little guy.

It's got some drawbacks but it also has a lot of features in common with the big boys up top, which I will get into, along with the fact that it's *less than 1/3rd the price and weighs half of each.*

The outside is, characteristically for a mid-range soft sided roller, nylon fabric. It isn't rubber coated like the PD or as **burly** as the B&R but it's pretty decent and has held up really well over time.

It has bumpers on the corners and an integrated TS lock on the main compartment

[https://imgur.com/a/Ws2S5Lw](https://imgur.com/a/Ws2S5Lw)

With only two, albeit really comfy handles you'll have fewer than on the others. Facts.

Its Handle is segmented like the B&R but only slightly taller than the PD Slim Drive. Taller, yes, but barely. And it wobBbBbBbLes a bit more. Not bad, but not as good as the B&R or PD.

**It also barely expands.**

The exterior has a pocket for some documents or a tablet and a zipper for some minimal expansion and compression, ***but the interior is where it really shines.***

Inside it has features that both the PD and B&R have, like a clever compartmentalized lid, and yes it opens as a lid not a clamshell, with space for some folded shirts behind a panel with a small mesh pouch and an integral wash pouch.

[https://imgur.com/a/iPk0YEG](https://imgur.com/a/iPk0YEG)

[https://imgur.com/a/s1FeEP7](https://imgur.com/a/s1FeEP7)

[https://imgur.com/a/v6dTOBc](https://imgur.com/a/v6dTOBc)

The pack-down straps are simple, seatbelt-esqua but it comes with a rigid panel that has a mesh zipped pocket on it to distribute the pressure to keep small items secure, something the PD forgoes.

And there's a neat little tipped pocket at the side. Cute.

[https://imgur.com/a/k9BFSyH](https://imgur.com/a/k9BFSyH)



**The wheels** are also really good. 

They aren't as big as the PD wheels, they aren't as burly in their hinge construction as the B&R but. They. Roll. So. Well. Not as good as its expensive brethren of course but way better than that 40 dollar thing you got off amazon.

[https://imgur.com/a/WDNZBWt](https://imgur.com/a/WDNZBWt)

*It also has a passthrough on its back to attach it to another roller!*

[https://imgur.com/a/DTcRFuN](https://imgur.com/a/DTcRFuN)



**Now, considering its spot in the market,**

my tiny Travelite is a piece of luggage i got to not deal with certain airlines in certain airports. Well, mainly Air France if I ever have the displeasure of going through Paris. You know if you've been.

It weighs 2.3kg, has a volume of 34-39L (althought I'm sure it's more of a 36-38 considering the way it expands) and meets every size requirement imagineable.

And it's 180 bucks before discount.

  
The warranty is 36 months for repairs after purchase, which is pretty good considering the price point and spare parts for the wheels aren't that expensive either after the period.

Here some more pictures with packing cubes:

[https://imgur.com/a/4G6Epiz](https://imgur.com/a/4G6Epiz)

  
Now, why am I mentioning this case? well, to disillusion anybody thinking they NEED a 600+ buck roller to have all these ameneties. The PD and B&R both have the issue of weight and price, so somebody looking for just a carry-on that is a quality product that will last a few years might be really happy with a cheaper well-made option after overcoming G.A.S and FOMO. Just food for thought.

1. Is milk okay to take post-op? I’ve seen mixed opinions.

2. Should I avoid whole grain bread in the first week or stick to softer foods?

3. Are chia seeds safe to take during recovery or could they cause discomfort?

4. Am I missing anything important from this list—especially for post-op wound care or food to ease digestion and prevent constipation?

5. Has anyone else used any of these food or wound care items (like Juven, Vashe, Aquaphor, etc.)—did they help?

6. Is fistula surgery considered medically necessary (for insurance/financial aid purposes)?

7. My surgery is scheduled for 12:00 PM—can I realistically expect to be discharged by 4-5 PM if all goes well? 

Also, I’m a huge coffee person, and it’s going to be tough to give it up and I know I absolutely shouldn’t touch cigarettes, so I will try doing everything I can to avoid those completely.

Any tips from those who’ve been through this would really help. I want to be as prepared and comfortable as possible during recovery.

Thanks so much in advance!",2,1748035973.0,AnalFistula,0,1.0,False

I’m halfway through Lord of Chaos and almost all the characters are unlikeable, the plot was written as if Jordan was TRYING to make it go on for as long as possible, and the writing is just so godsdamned clunky in parts (but that’s more a thing of that era of high fantasy in general, thanks Tolkien).

I was reading so I could better appreciate moments we would’ve seen like Dumai’s Wells and Cadsuane and of course The Last Battle. But now my eagerness is just…diminished.

I'm looking for a studio apartment with a budget of **$3,000/month or less**. My ideal neighborhood has **restaurants, a locally owned coffee shop, and a grocery store all within walking distance**.

The areas I've been looking at are **Little Italy, East Village, Cortez Hill, and Gaslamp Quarter**. These stood out because of their proximity to restaurants. However, I'm totally **open to other runner-friendly areas** where I can still walk to my daily essentials.

I'm a runner and want to be able to leave my apartment and **run for 6-15+ miles** without feeling unsafe or like I'm going to get hit by a car. I'm used to urban running and occasional interactons with unhoused individuals, as I currently live downtown in a smaller city.

1ktv6kx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ktv6kx/aio_is_my_bf_too_strict_with_me/,AIO: is my bf too strict with me?,"TLDR: my bf is super hard on me with specific things around the house but not with others. Does this seem reasonable? Or am I just being sensitive? 


My bf 37M and I 35F live together and are both very clean and tidy. In the beginning of the relationship he even said I was so organized and clean and he’s never seen a girl have such order cleaning wise. He is a bit more anal about things like dishes in the sink while I’m more particular about clutter and him leaving things out. 

I give him grace most times and usually put his stuff away without even mentioning it because we both live here and who cares? It takes me 2 seconds. Sometimes I gently remind him and he obliges. However, he doesn’t have the same patience with me. This morning I left a coffee spill next to the coffee machine that happened to drip on a door. He said it takes a lot to scrub off and the effort is immense. I agree. However, I obviously didn’t do it on purpose or even notice it before I ran off to my meeting upstairs (I work remote) otherwise I would have immediately wiped it. 

Mid day he sends me a text with a pic of the stain and says this is hard to clean and to be careful. I came downstairs and said to him “ah ok understood. I’ll pay more attention in the future” this is after I have already implemented some other ways to be careful such as holding a towel under the espresso thingy and wiping after myself meticulously because I know if I don’t he will call it out. 

He got mad at me still and basically it felt like he wanted me to feel super bad about this. It wasn’t enough that I acknowledged it and took accountability and said I’ll do better. He wanted me to specifically say “I’ll go clean it”. Which I was going to do but we were inbetween meetings and I had to hop on another. It turned into a whole argument where he threatened to not go on vacation with me anymore and that he would cancel our lunch date tomorrow. Later he said he overreacted a little but still claims I should have said I’d clean it because apparently idk how hard this stain is to get out and I’m careless. (I’ve cleaned this stain before I get it but I didn’t think it warranted such berating. My dad was like this and it created immense stress in my family. Basically nobody was allowed to make any mistakes). 

I’m even avoiding stepping into the kitchen because he will look over my shoulder and if I do even anything slightly not the way he would or even spill something he will say I ruined dinner or how terrible it is. Honestly, to me, it’s the lack of kindness and the way he just needs me to feel guilty or shameful. I don’t ever treat him this way and he does waaay more things that I’ve asked him not to do in the past but with me he has no grace. For the record, his brother came over a while back and made a giant mess at the coffee machine and all he said to him was “ah I wish you wouldn’t have done that.” 

I feel like I’m in a relationship with a person who feels like performing and earning love is normal. I’ve grown up this way and took a long time to heal to feel worthy again and I feel like now unless I do things perfectly and his way and dont make any mistakes that then I am “good”. Otherwise I feel like shit. I don’t get a lot of affection either. If it was more balanced or if I felt appreciated for my efforts to please him I would probably feel more motivated.  He always wants praise for everything he does (which I give him) but seems like with me he has zero patience and I can’t do anything right. 

Does he just hate me?? Am I overreacting? He stressed me out so much that I got a headache and was going my meetings with a migraine the rest of the day. A small mistake like this shouldn’t have turned into a huge quarrel. ",2,1748035913.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

For as long as I can remember, I’ve struggled with feeling tired all the time. No matter how much I slept, I’d wake up groggy and stay sluggish all day. My brain felt foggy, and I’d lose focus so easily—even on things I enjoyed! I also noticed I was gaining weight, my motivation was slipping, and my mood was all over the place.

I tried everything I could think of: drinking more water, getting more exercise, even following advice from popular health gurus online. I bought fancy vitamins and tried weird diets, but nothing really helped for long. It felt like my body just wasn’t working right, and I was getting more frustrated every day.

That’s when I stumbled across MITOLYN. I saw so many people raving about it online, and I thought, “Maybe this is finally something that will help.”

# First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I was actually impressed right away. The box looked really nice and modern—not flimsy or cheap. The instructions were super clear, and it was easy to see how much to take and when. There was even a little card inside with tips and encouragement, which made me feel like the company really cared about my results.

I was also happy to see that the ingredients list was simple and didn’t have anything weird or artificial. I’ve tried products before that were packed with stuff I couldn’t pronounce, but MITOLYN’s formula looked clean and trustworthy.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I didn’t expect to feel different right away. Most supplements take weeks or months to show any effect, and I was ready to be patient. But, to my surprise, I started to notice little changes just a few days after starting MITOLYN.

First, I had more energy in the morning. I didn’t feel like I was dragging myself out of bed. My brain felt less foggy—I could focus better at work and even remember little things like where I left my keys! By the end of the first week, I realized I wasn’t reaching for coffee every couple of hours. My energy lasted longer and felt much more natural.

As the days went by, my mood improved, too. I felt less stressed and more upbeat. My cravings for junk food went down, and I even started enjoying my workouts again. I honestly couldn’t believe that something so simple could make such a big difference so quickly.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are so many health supplements out there, but MITOLYN really does a few things differently:

✅ **Only the Good Stuff**  
MITOLYN only uses quality ingredients—no weird fillers or fake flavors. I could tell it was made with care, and I felt safe taking it every day.

✅ **Visible, Real Results**  
This wasn’t just a “maybe I feel better” kind of thing. I felt stronger, more focused, and just happier overall. My friends and family even started to notice!

✅ **Safe and Gentle**  
I didn’t have any bad reactions or upset stomach, which has happened to me with other supplements before. MITOLYN felt gentle, but powerful.

✅ **Worth the Money**  
I know there are cheaper options, but MITOLYN actually works. I stopped wasting money on all those other things that never made a difference.

✅ **Loved by Real People**  
It’s not just me—there are thousands of people online sharing their MITOLYN stories. That made me feel confident I’d made the right choice.

# People Around Me Noticed

One of the coolest parts of my MITOLYN journey was how quickly people around me started to see the change. My coworkers asked if I’d changed my routine because I seemed more energetic and positive. My friends commented that I looked healthier and more “present.” Even my family noticed I was less grumpy and more fun to be around!

When I told them about MITOLYN, a few of them decided to give it a try, and they had great results too. It felt good to share something that actually worked instead of just another fad.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had one small issue with my order (the shipping took a bit longer than expected because of a holiday), so I reached out to MITOLYN’s customer support. They replied quickly and were super friendly. They even checked in a week later to make sure everything had arrived and that I was happy with my purchase.

It’s rare to find a company that treats you like a real person, not just a number. MITOLYN’s team really made me feel valued and supported throughout my whole experience.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Without a doubt, yes! I’ve already told my closest friends and family, and I’m telling you now: MITOLYN is worth trying if you’re tired of feeling tired, unfocused, or just not like yourself. It’s made a huge difference in my life, and I honestly wish I’d found it sooner.

If you’re wondering if it’s right for you, I’d say go for it. You won’t know until you try, and you might be surprised at just how much better you can feel.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are so many health supplements out there, but MITOLYN really does a few things differently:

✅ **Only the Good Stuff**  
MITOLYN only uses quality ingredients—no weird fillers or fake flavors. I could tell it was made with care, and I felt safe taking it every day.

✅ **Visible, Real Results**  
This wasn’t just a “maybe I feel better” kind of thing. I felt stronger, more focused, and just happier overall. My friends and family even started to notice!

✅ **Safe and Gentle**  
I didn’t have any bad reactions or upset stomach, which has happened to me with other supplements before. MITOLYN felt gentle, but powerful.

✅ **Worth the Money**  
I know there are cheaper options, but MITOLYN actually works. I stopped wasting money on all those other things that never made a difference.

✅ **Loved by Real People**  
It’s not just me—there are thousands of people online sharing their MITOLYN stories. That made me feel confident I’d made the right choice.

# People Around Me Noticed

One of the coolest parts of my MITOLYN journey was how quickly people around me started to see the change. My coworkers asked if I’d changed my routine because I seemed more energetic and positive. My friends commented that I looked healthier and more “present.” Even my family noticed I was less grumpy and more fun to be around!

When I told them about MITOLYN, a few of them decided to give it a try, and they had great results too. It felt good to share something that actually worked instead of just another fad.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had one small issue with my order (the shipping took a bit longer than expected because of a holiday), so I reached out to MITOLYN’s customer support. They replied quickly and were super friendly. They even checked in a week later to make sure everything had arrived and that I was happy with my purchase.

It’s rare to find a company that treats you like a real person, not just a number. MITOLYN’s team really made me feel valued and supported throughout my whole experience.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Without a doubt, yes! I’ve already told my closest friends and family, and I’m telling you now: MITOLYN is worth trying if you’re tired of feeling tired, unfocused, or just not like yourself. It’s made a huge difference in my life, and I honestly wish I’d found it sooner.

If you’re wondering if it’s right for you, I’d say go for it. You won’t know until you try, and you might be surprised at just how much better you can feel.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued — but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.

After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I’m honestly impressed.

This isn’t just another energy pill — it’s something different, and in this review, I’ll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it’s worth considering.

What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.

That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.

What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.

PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).

N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.

Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.

Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.

Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.

In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.

My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.

Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.

Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""

Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.

The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.

Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.

Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.

Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.

Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:

Clean, research-based ingredient list

No stimulants, no crash

Noticeable improvements after consistent use

Supports both mind and body

Manufactured with high quality standards

Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens

Cons:

Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)

Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements

Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)

Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:

Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep

Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness

Want better exercise performance and recovery

Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally

Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements

However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.

Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.

I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.

Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.

Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time — think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

[**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://548b1g18r1k85q1kz6obd7zkkf.hop.clickbank.net)

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, “I used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen.

Does this seem reasonable? Or am I just being sensitive? 



My bf 37M and I 35F live together and are both very clean and tidy. In the beginning of the relationship he even said I was so organized and clean and he’s never seen a girl have such order cleaning wise. He is a bit more anal about things like dishes in the sink while I’m more particular about clutter and him leaving things out. 

I give him grace most times and usually put his stuff away without even mentioning it because we both live here and who cares? It takes me 2 seconds. Sometimes I gently remind him and he obliges. However, he doesn’t have the same patience with me. This morning I left a coffee spill next to the coffee machine that happened to drip on a door. He said it takes a lot to scrub off and the effort is immense. I agree. However, I obviously didn’t do it on purpose or even notice it before I ran off to my meeting upstairs (I work remote) otherwise I would have immediately wiped it. 

Mid day he sends me a text with a pic of the stain and says this is hard to clean and to be careful. I came downstairs and said to him “ah ok understood. I’ll pay more attention in the future” this is after I have already implemented some other ways to be careful such as holding a towel under the espresso thingy and wiping after myself meticulously because I know if I don’t he will call it out. 

He got mad at me still and basically it felt like he wanted me to feel super bad about this. It wasn’t enough that I acknowledged it and took accountability and said I’ll do better. He wanted me to specifically say “I’ll go clean it”. Which I was going to do but we were inbetween meetings and I had to hop on another. It turned into a whole argument where he threatened to not go on vacation with me anymore and that he would cancel our lunch date tomorrow. Later he said he overreacted a little but still claims I should have said I’d clean it because apparently idk how hard this stain is to get out and I’m careless. (I’ve cleaned this stain before I get it but I didn’t think it warranted such berating. My dad was like this and it created immense stress in my family. Basically nobody was allowed to make any mistakes). 

I’m even avoiding stepping into the kitchen because he will look over my shoulder and if I do even anything slightly not the way he would or even spill something he will say I ruined dinner or how terrible it is. Honestly, to me, it’s the lack of kindness and the way he just needs me to feel guilty or shameful. I don’t ever treat him this way and he does waaay more things that I’ve asked him not to do in the past but with me he has no grace. For the record, his brother came over a while back and made a giant mess at the coffee machine and all he said to him was “ah I wish you wouldn’t have done that.” 

I feel like I’m in a relationship with a person who feels like performing and earning love is normal. I’ve grown up this way and took a long time to heal to feel worthy again and I feel like now unless I do things perfectly and his way and dont make any mistakes that then I am “good”. Otherwise I feel like shit. I don’t get a lot of affection either. If it was more balanced or if I felt appreciated for my efforts to please him I would probably feel more motivated.

Does he just hate me?? Am I overreacting? He stressed me out so much that I got a headache and was going my meetings with a migraine the rest of the day. A small mistake like this shouldn’t have turned into a huge quarrel. ",0,1748035870.0,AskMenAdvice,24,0.5,False

If you’ve landed here, you’re probably feeling what I once felt — constant bloating, unpredictable digestion, low energy, and that frustrating feeling that your gut is sabotaging your day-to-day life. I’m here to share my real story with you — no gimmicks, just what actually happened after I started using **Prime Biome**. Spoiler alert: it changed everything for me.

# ❌ Before Prime Biome: A Daily Struggle with My Body

For years, I struggled with poor digestion, irregular bathroom habits, and painful bloating. I couldn’t enjoy my favorite meals without paying for it later. I tried everything—diets, pills, powders, and even harsh cleanses. Some worked for a week, most didn’t work at all.

I was constantly tired, cranky, and starting to feel like my body was just… broken. I was even embarrassed in social settings because of how uncomfortable I felt. Food became an enemy, and so did my own body.

That's when a friend recommended **Prime Biome**.

# ✅ Why I Chose Prime Biome

To be honest, I was skeptical. I’d tried probiotics before, and none had truly worked long-term. But Prime Biome stood out for three reasons:

1. **Clinically backed strains** – Not just trendy buzzwords.
2. **Real user reviews** – Not fake hype, but honest stories.
3. **Gut, brain, and immune support in one** – It wasn’t just about digestion, it was a full health reset.

I figured I had nothing to lose, and everything to gain. So I gave it 30 days.

# 🔄 My First 7 Days with Prime Biome

The change wasn’t immediate, but it was noticeable. On Day 3, I woke up with more energy than usual. By Day 5, the usual afternoon fatigue didn’t hit me like a truck. And the most shocking thing?

**My stomach was calm.**

No random gurgling, no bloating, no discomfort after eating. I felt *normal* — a feeling I hadn’t had in years.

# 🌟 After 30 Days: A Total Transformation

Here’s what happened after taking **Prime Biome** consistently for one month:

* ✅ **Zero bloating** even after my ""cheat meals""
* ✅ **Regular digestion** — like clockwork
* ✅ **No more gut-induced brain fog**
* ✅ **Stronger immunity** — no sick days since
* ✅ **Increased energy** throughout the day

My mood improved. My skin looked clearer. My confidence came back. I stopped feeling like I had to hide my discomfort or explain my diet choices. I was just… *better*.

# 🔬 What’s Inside Prime Biome?

Unlike many probiotic products filled with filler strains and hype, Prime Biome is formulated with **clinically researched strains** that target both gut and immune health. It includes:

* **Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains** – for digestion and inflammation
* **Prebiotics** – to feed the good bacteria
* **Advanced delayed-release capsules** – so the live cultures actually *reach* your gut

And it’s free from gluten, dairy, GMOs, and artificial junk.

# 🛡️ Trust & Transparency

I did my homework — Prime Biome is manufactured in a **GMP-certified** facility in the USA and goes through **third-party lab testing**. That means no shortcuts, no lies. It’s one of the few gut health supplements I fully trust.

# 💬 Real Customer Reviews (Other Than Mine)

When I started talking about Prime Biome online, the floodgates opened. Here’s what *others* are saying:

* “My IBS symptoms are practically gone.”
* “I’ve lost 8 lbs just from reducing inflammation and water retention.”
* “My mood swings are way more manageable now.”

I realized I wasn’t alone. Prime Biome isn’t just a product. It’s a *community* of people finally getting their life back.

# 🙌 Who Should Use Prime Biome?

You should consider Prime Biome if you…

This is not just about gut health. It’s about your **whole health**.

# 🚫 Who Shouldn’t Use It?

Honestly, if you’re looking for a quick-fix detox gimmick or magic pill with no effort, this isn’t it. Prime Biome is **science-backed** and **results-driven** — but it works best with consistency. It's not a miracle — it's *medicine for your gut*.

# 🔄 I’ll Never Go Back

I’ve tried going without Prime Biome for a few weeks just to see the difference. Bad idea. Within 10 days, my energy dipped, my digestion went out of sync, and I started feeling “off” again. That’s how I knew: **Prime Biome works**. Not just as a boost, but as a foundation for my wellness.

# 💡 Final Thoughts: It’s Worth Every Penny

You’ve spent money on coffee, junk food, random supplements, and 7-day miracle detoxes. What if you invested that in your **gut health**, which controls over 70% of your immune system and affects your mood, weight, and energy?

If your stomach feels like it’s controlling your life…  
If you want *lasting* results, not just temporary relief…

Let me begin this review with complete honesty — **I was a skeptic.** I’ve tried dozens of so-called ""miracle"" supplements in the past, each promising more energy, better focus, and optimal health. Some worked a little, most didn’t work at all, and a few actually made things worse.

But then, I discovered **MITOLYN** — and everything changed.

# 🌿 Why I Tried MITOLYN

Like many others, I was dealing with **fatigue**, mental fog, poor digestion, and an overall lack of motivation. I wasn’t ""sick"" per se, but I certainly wasn’t thriving either. Coffee had stopped working, and no amount of diet changes or workouts helped for long.

I stumbled upon **MITOLYN** through a recommendation in a health forum. People were raving about it. Not influencers. **Real people**. That got my attention.

# 🔍 What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not your average multivitamin or caffeine-loaded pill. It’s a **mitochondrial support supplement**—designed to rejuvenate your cells, boost energy production, and restore biological balance at the **deepest cellular level**.

It uses advanced ingredients that work synergistically to support **mitochondrial health**, which is the **core power center** of every cell in your body. If your mitochondria are tired, **you’re tired.** MITOLYN fixes that.

# 🧪 The Ingredients: Science-Backed & Potent

I did my research before trying MITOLYN. I was blown away by the ingredient list. It's packed with:

* **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)** – a rare compound proven to stimulate new mitochondria growth.

MITOLYN is not your average multivitamin or caffeine-loaded pill. It’s a **mitochondrial support supplement**—designed to rejuvenate your cells, boost energy production, and restore biological balance at the **deepest cellular level**.

It uses advanced ingredients that work synergistically to support **mitochondrial health**, which is the **core power center** of every cell in your body. If your mitochondria are tired, **you’re tired.** MITOLYN fixes that.

I did my research before trying MITOLYN. I was blown away by the ingredient list. It's packed with:

Let me start by saying something bold: **MITOLYN didn’t just improve my health—it gave me my life back.** And if you’ve ever struggled with fatigue, brain fog, lack of motivation, or unexplained health slumps, then what I’m about to share could completely change your perspective on supplements—and maybe even your life.

# My Story Before MITOLYN

A few months ago, I was a different person. I was tired all the time. Not the kind of tired a nap could fix, but the deep, soul-sucking fatigue that makes it hard to get out of bed or even enjoy the things you love.

I was also forgetful—missing appointments, losing focus at work, and constantly misplacing things. It felt like my brain was wrapped in fog. I tried drinking more coffee, exercising, and even cutting out sugar, but nothing worked long-term.

Doctors told me my blood work was “normal.” I started to believe maybe this was just aging. But I’m only in my 30s!

# Discovering MITOLYN

Then I came across **MITOLYN**, a mitochondrial health supplement that promised to restore energy, improve cognitive function, and boost cellular performance. I’ll admit—I was skeptical. I had tried a dozen other supplements with flashy labels and zero results.

But something about MITOLYN felt different.

It wasn’t marketed like a miracle pill. Instead, it was backed by science, clearly explained, and focused on **restoring mitochondria—the powerhouse of our cells**. I didn’t even realize how much my mitochondrial health affected my overall well-being.

Still, I hesitated. But after reading hundreds of positive MITOLYN reviews, and learning that it was made with high-quality, research-backed ingredients, I decided to give it a try. I figured if even half of the claims were true, it would be worth it.

And I’m so glad I took that step.

# The First Week – Subtle But Noticeable

I didn’t expect immediate results, but I started noticing small changes around **day 4**.

* I was waking up feeling a little more refreshed.
* My afternoon crashes weren’t as brutal.
* I didn’t need my second or third cup of coffee just to function.

I wasn’t suddenly running marathons, but it felt like something inside me was “rebooting.”

# Week 2 to Week 4 – Real Transformation

By the **second week**, the changes were undeniable:

✅ I had more energy in the morning.  
✅ My focus at work improved dramatically.  
✅ I felt more emotionally stable, even in stressful situations.  
✅ Brain fog? Gone.

But the most impressive result was my **improved stamina and mood**. I started walking longer, sleeping better, and even enjoying social events again. I could feel my body working better, my brain sharper, and my motivation returning.

MITOLYN wasn’t just helping me survive—it was helping me **thrive**.

# Why MITOLYN Works (Better Than Anything I’ve Tried)

After a bit of research, I realized **why** MITOLYN delivers such great results. It’s not just a random mix of vitamins. It’s a **science-based formulation** targeting mitochondrial health—something most supplements totally ignore.

Here’s what stood out to me:

* ✅ **Targeted Mitochondrial Support** – It supports the repair and function of mitochondria, the energy engines of our cells.
* ✅ **Clean, High-Quality Ingredients** – No fillers, no junk, just pure, effective components.
* ✅ **Visible Results** – Unlike other supplements that promise the world but deliver nothing, MITOLYN actually works—and fast.

# What Makes MITOLYN Different from Other Supplements?

Let’s be honest: the supplement industry is full of hype. I’ve wasted hundreds of dollars on bottles that sit half-full on my shelf. So what made MITOLYN different?

* **Transparency** – They clearly explain every ingredient and its function.
* **Customer Support** – I had a shipping question, and their team responded within hours—professional and helpful.
* **No Side Effects** – This is huge. I’ve had stomach issues with other supplements, but MITOLYN digested easily.

# How I Use It

I take **two capsules daily with water**—one in the morning, one in the early afternoon. That’s it. No complicated routines, no timing tricks. Just consistency.

And yes, I’ve subscribed to monthly auto-ship because I never want to run out again.

# What Others Are Saying (And It’s Not Just Me)

If you search for MITOLYN reviews, you’ll find a community of people just like me—regular folks who struggled with energy, focus, and health issues and found real relief with this supplement.

Some say it helped with **chronic fatigue**, others saw improvement in **mood, skin clarity, and physical performance**. It’s not magic—it’s **science working at the cellular level**.

# Final Verdict: Should You Try MITOLYN?

If you’ve read this far, chances are you’re looking for something real. Something effective. Something that can help you feel **like yourself again**.

Well, take it from someone who tried everything and nearly gave up: **MITOLYN works.**

Whether you’re dealing with:

* Fatigue
* Brain fog
* Poor focus
* Low motivation
* Cellular aging

…MITOLYN might just be your breakthrough.

I’m not a doctor. I’m not a celebrity. I’m just someone who took a chance—and found a product that actually lives up to the hype.

I’ve recently downloaded dating apps again and am seriously thinking about actually going on dates rather than just ghosting and deleting the apps again. My question is, what, if any, first date advice would you all give for simple coffee or dinner dates? And I mean ANY advice whatsoever. From looks (what to wear etc), to even what to talk about.

However one downfall that made us doubt the place is that there is no balcony, that you can go out to stand in, or a terrace. It only has s few french balconies in different sides of the house. 

We’d like to hear from people who are living or have lived in a place with no balcony or terrace, or your opinions in general, how much does it affect you? Do you see it as a big downfall? This place does have big windows.

For us, its not that we always go out in the balcony in our current place, especially in winter days, but for at least 4-5 months a year, its nice to sometimes have a coffee outside for a while or hang our clothes in the sun, but now we will not have that. 

Thanks in advance for your inputs!
Ps. We do acknowledge the tremendously bad housing crisis here and consider ourselves lucky to be chosen for the place. Please no negativity here.

Final dimensions of the top will be 36"" x 36"" x 3¾"" that will sit on a welded square tube steel base. Going for a rustic look and want to maintain the natural character of the wood. I've already jointed/planed the sides on most of them, but will sanding down hard edges on top so they don't look so milled. I'm planning on boring out probably 3 holes across the beams to run threaded rod and nuts to hold them together. But this is more for aesthetic so I know this wouldn't be enough by itself for permanently joining them.

My main concerns are wood movement since these are thick, dense hardwood pieces and I'm worried about seasonal expansion and contraction causing issues. I also need the joint to be strong enough for daily use as a coffee table while preserving that rustic aesthetic (Don't want overly visible hardware or joints that look too ""perfect"").

I've got decent woodworking experience but this is my first time working with stock this thick and this species. Any advice from folks who've tackled similar projects would be hugely appreciated!

\
WASHINGTON, D.C. (Worthy Satire) - In a bold move to save the American economy a full $0.008 per citizen, the U.S. Mint announced it is moving forward with plans to assassinate the penny -- the coin that costs more to make than it's worth and has spent the last 30 years hiding under couch cushions and gas station floors.\
\
""We've tried everything -- public shaming, rounding laws, even letting Canada shame us -- but the penny just won't die,"" said Mint spokesperson Paula Zinc. ""Now we're pulling the plug. It's over. We're melting Lincoln.""\
\
However, not all elements of the one-cent piece will perish. Officials confirmed that ""In God We Trust"" -- the national motto, spiritual lifeline, and fallback answer on every high school history test -- will be spared and reassigned to other currency like a divine game of musical chairs.\
\
""You can kill the penny,"" said Treasury Secretary spokesman, ""but you can't kill trust in God. That's been grandfathered in since about 1956.""\
\
Critics warned that removing the penny could disrupt the sacred tradition of grumpy men paying in exact change at the DMV, but proponents noted it might also spare countless Americans the embarrassment of scraping the checkout tray for 4¢ in public.\
\
Meanwhile, millions of pennies are reportedly hoarding together in coffee cans, preparing for what they call The Copper Rebellion.\
\
Stay tuned. Or better yet, just round up.\

1ktuxvs,https://i.redd.it/urd4npk9ml2f1.png,I built a news aggregator because Apple News wasn't available in my country.,"Hey Reddit,

For the last three years, I've been working on a project close to my heart: a news aggregator app called [Newsreadeck](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/newsreadeck/id1593025917). I have a tradition of kickstarting my mornings with a cup of coffee in one hand and a variety of news sources in the other. Yet, I've noticed that most comparable apps cater primarily to an English-speaking, U.S.-based audience.

I first experimented with using RSS feeds, but soon found that many sites don't support them, and manually sorting or finding RSS feeds proved to be a cumbersome task. Even when I did find feeds, they either redirected to web pages or offered only partial views of articles instead of full content.

To overcome these hurdles, I designed my own data sources. I created a collection of over 16,000 carefully selected sources, classified by language, geographical location, and subject, which I carefully review for credibility. This app gives you the freedom to explore and follow as many sources as you like and provides seamless access to articles. I've also developed a specialized reader that strips away ads, banners, and other disruptions, although it can't yet bypass all paywalls.

Hey there! I'm 33 and based in Michigan. I’m mostly looking for long-term chat friends to build a genuine connection with — but I’m also open to seeing where things go if we click.

A little about me: I’ve got the whole “adulting” thing down pretty well — career, bills, responsibilities, etc. But when it comes to my personal life, I really appreciate a slower, quieter pace. I’m definitely more on the introverted side, but once I’m comfortable with someone, my silly and sarcastic side comes out a lot.

I don’t have kids but I’m open to them. I’m also not religious, in case that matters to you.

Some of my favorite things:

Watching sports (especially when there's a good game on)

Trash TV — the messier, the better

Reading (fiction, nonfiction, anything interesting)

Cooking (bonus if you like swapping recipes)

And of course... coffee. It's practically a personality trait at this point.

I was like, *“we just watched a full season on Netflix together, what do you mean”*  
She’s like, “We always do the same thing… Netflix, food, chill, repeat. I’m bored. Let’s go out. Meet new people. Do *something*.”

Fair enough, I thought.  
So I ping my group chat — classic “let’s do something this weekend?”  
And guess what?

Silence.  
Or worse:

“Bro kal pakka”

“Noida to CP? Bhai tu rehne de”

“Lemme check with the others” → gone forever 👻

I realized I’ve been stuck in the same loop for months — wanna go out, but either friends bail or I’ve got no clue who’s down.  
So instead of cribbing, I ended up building [Catchup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycompany.meetup).

It’s a super simple app — no fancy BS.  
You just open it, see random plans happening near you (coffee meetups, game nights, food walks, etc.), or make your own plan and let others join in.

It’s kinda like this:  
“Yo, grabbing chai at 6 near Saket. Anyone around?”  
And if someone vibes, they show up. That’s it. No endless planning. No flaky friends. No awkward small talk.

You’re not stuck swiping through bios either — it’s more about just *doing stuff* with people who are also bored and down.

I made it for people like me — who wanna be social but don’t wanna deal with all the effort it usually takes.

We just launched in Delhi, it’s still early, but if you’re tired of couch weekends or just wanna do something *different* — give it a try.

I crafted the backend using Vapor, and the frontend is built with UIKit, RxSwift, and CoreData (old school). While I employed some frameworks, I haven't used SwiftUI yet.

I am unable to grind my beans any finer than the 25 setting. When I put my 17g of beans into the hopper, it's just immediately jammed/stalled. It makes the loud sound listed in the video. If I pour the beans in one by one (very tedious and takes the joy out of me), it is able to grind through without any loud sound. 

I've taken out the burrs and cleaned it all, cleaned the inside thoroughly of any buildup of coffee grounds, but it still makes the same sound. Anything coarser than a 25 setting seems to be okay, but then my grounds are too coarse...

I'm not sure what to do. Is it worth replacing the burrs, knowing that that might not be the definitive solution? or is it worth just getting a new machine? any help would be appreciated!

I have been working 6am-3pm everyday since Tuesday and getting paid $13/hr.  There was really not much to it as most of it was pretty easy. I just had to get the hang of closing the register and recognizing different cigarettes, nicotine and tobacco as I’m not a smoker. I got free fountain drinks and coffee and really took advantage of the latter as I had to get up early everyday.

What I was told is that we don’t really get any actual breaks. If we needed a break we could step outside for a few and have someone take over until we got back. If we wanted food we ate during our shifts. We use paycom for clocking in and payroll and from online training they do have a button to go on break but on the tablet we use to clock in it seems like that option has been turned off. 

Honestly I don’t really mind that I don’t have breaks. Sure I’m on my feet a lot as I stand in one spot for 9 hours but it’s not the end of the world. I don’t get overwhelmed by my work and I can handle money pretty easily. My coworkers are super nice and we all get along pretty well.

Supplements like MITOLYN are getting tons of attention these days, and I kept seeing ads and reviews everywhere. People say it can boost your energy, sharpen your mind, and help your body run better. With so many glowing reviews, I couldn’t help but wonder: could this actually be the answer I was looking for? So, I decided to try MITOLYN myself for three whole months—even though it wasn’t cheap! I wanted to see if it would really make a difference in my life. Here’s my honest MITOLYN review and everything you need to know if you’re thinking about giving it a shot.

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

For as long as I can remember, I’ve struggled with feeling tired all the time. No matter how much I slept, I’d wake up groggy and stay sluggish all day. My brain felt foggy, and I’d lose focus so easily—even on things I enjoyed! I also noticed I was gaining weight, my motivation was slipping, and my mood was all over the place.

I tried everything I could think of: drinking more water, getting more exercise, even following advice from popular health gurus online. I bought fancy vitamins and tried weird diets, but nothing really helped for long. It felt like my body just wasn’t working right, and I was getting more frustrated every day.

That’s when I stumbled across MITOLYN. I saw so many people raving about it online, and I thought, “Maybe this is finally something that will help.”

# First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I was actually impressed right away. The box looked really nice and modern—not flimsy or cheap. The instructions were super clear, and it was easy to see how much to take and when. There was even a little card inside with tips and encouragement, which made me feel like the company really cared about my results.

I was also happy to see that the ingredients list was simple and didn’t have anything weird or artificial. I’ve tried products before that were packed with stuff I couldn’t pronounce, but MITOLYN’s formula looked clean and trustworthy.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I didn’t expect to feel different right away. Most supplements take weeks or months to show any effect, and I was ready to be patient. But, to my surprise, I started to notice little changes just a few days after starting MITOLYN.

First, I had more energy in the morning. I didn’t feel like I was dragging myself out of bed. My brain felt less foggy—I could focus better at work and even remember little things like where I left my keys! By the end of the first week, I realized I wasn’t reaching for coffee every couple of hours. My energy lasted longer and felt much more natural.

As the days went by, my mood improved, too. I felt less stressed and more upbeat. My cravings for junk food went down, and I even started enjoying my workouts again. I honestly couldn’t believe that something so simple could make such a big difference so quickly.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are so many health supplements out there, but MITOLYN really does a few things differently:

✅ **Only the Good Stuff**  
MITOLYN only uses quality ingredients—no weird fillers or fake flavors. I could tell it was made with care, and I felt safe taking it every day.

✅ **Visible, Real Results**  
This wasn’t just a “maybe I feel better” kind of thing. I felt stronger, more focused, and just happier overall. My friends and family even started to notice!

✅ **Safe and Gentle**  
I didn’t have any bad reactions or upset stomach, which has happened to me with other supplements before. MITOLYN felt gentle, but powerful.

✅ **Worth the Money**  
I know there are cheaper options, but MITOLYN actually works. I stopped wasting money on all those other things that never made a difference.

✅ **Loved by Real People**  
It’s not just me—there are thousands of people online sharing their MITOLYN stories. That made me feel confident I’d made the right choice.

# People Around Me Noticed

One of the coolest parts of my MITOLYN journey was how quickly people around me started to see the change. My coworkers asked if I’d changed my routine because I seemed more energetic and positive. My friends commented that I looked healthier and more “present.” Even my family noticed I was less grumpy and more fun to be around!

When I told them about MITOLYN, a few of them decided to give it a try, and they had great results too. It felt good to share something that actually worked instead of just another fad.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had one small issue with my order (the shipping took a bit longer than expected because of a holiday), so I reached out to MITOLYN’s customer support. They replied quickly and were super friendly. They even checked in a week later to make sure everything had arrived and that I was happy with my purchase.

It’s rare to find a company that treats you like a real person, not just a number. MITOLYN’s team really made me feel valued and supported throughout my whole experience.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Without a doubt, yes! I’ve already told my closest friends and family, and I’m telling you now: MITOLYN is worth trying if you’re tired of feeling tired, unfocused, or just not like yourself. It’s made a huge difference in my life, and I honestly wish I’d found it sooner.

If you’re wondering if it’s right for you, I’d say go for it. You won’t know until you try, and you might be surprised at just how much better you can feel.

Without a doubt, yes! I’ve already told my closest friends and family, and I’m telling you now: MITOLYN is worth trying if you’re tired of feeling tired, unfocused, or just not like yourself. It’s made a huge difference in my life, and I honestly wish I’d found it sooner.

If you’re wondering if it’s right for you, I’d say go for it. You won’t know until you try, and you might be surprised at just how much better you can feel.

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

For as long as I can remember, I’ve struggled with feeling tired all the time. No matter how much I slept, I’d wake up groggy and stay sluggish all day. My brain felt foggy, and I’d lose focus so easily—even on things I enjoyed! I also noticed I was gaining weight, my motivation was slipping, and my mood was all over the place.

I tried everything I could think of: drinking more water, getting more exercise, even following advice from popular health gurus online. I bought fancy vitamins and tried weird diets, but nothing really helped for long. It felt like my body just wasn’t working right, and I was getting more frustrated every day.

That’s when I stumbled across MITOLYN. I saw so many people raving about it online, and I thought, “Maybe this is finally something that will help.”

# First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I was actually impressed right away. The box looked really nice and modern—not flimsy or cheap. The instructions were super clear, and it was easy to see how much to take and when. There was even a little card inside with tips and encouragement, which made me feel like the company really cared about my results.

I was also happy to see that the ingredients list was simple and didn’t have anything weird or artificial. I’ve tried products before that were packed with stuff I couldn’t pronounce, but MITOLYN’s formula looked clean and trustworthy.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I didn’t expect to feel different right away. Most supplements take weeks or months to show any effect, and I was ready to be patient. But, to my surprise, I started to notice little changes just a few days after starting MITOLYN.

First, I had more energy in the morning. I didn’t feel like I was dragging myself out of bed. My brain felt less foggy—I could focus better at work and even remember little things like where I left my keys! By the end of the first week, I realized I wasn’t reaching for coffee every couple of hours. My energy lasted longer and felt much more natural.

As the days went by, my mood improved, too. I felt less stressed and more upbeat. My cravings for junk food went down, and I even started enjoying my workouts again. I honestly couldn’t believe that something so simple could make such a big difference so quickly.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are so many health supplements out there, but MITOLYN really does a few things differently:

✅ **Only the Good Stuff**  
MITOLYN only uses quality ingredients—no weird fillers or fake flavors. I could tell it was made with care, and I felt safe taking it every day.

✅ **Visible, Real Results**  
This wasn’t just a “maybe I feel better” kind of thing. I felt stronger, more focused, and just happier overall. My friends and family even started to notice!

✅ **Safe and Gentle**  
I didn’t have any bad reactions or upset stomach, which has happened to me with other supplements before. MITOLYN felt gentle, but powerful.

✅ **Worth the Money**  
I know there are cheaper options, but MITOLYN actually works. I stopped wasting money on all those other things that never made a difference.

✅ **Loved by Real People**  
It’s not just me—there are thousands of people online sharing their MITOLYN stories. That made me feel confident I’d made the right choice.

# People Around Me Noticed

One of the coolest parts of my MITOLYN journey was how quickly people around me started to see the change. My coworkers asked if I’d changed my routine because I seemed more energetic and positive. My friends commented that I looked healthier and more “present.” Even my family noticed I was less grumpy and more fun to be around!

When I told them about MITOLYN, a few of them decided to give it a try, and they had great results too. It felt good to share something that actually worked instead of just another fad.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had one small issue with my order (the shipping took a bit longer than expected because of a holiday), so I reached out to MITOLYN’s customer support. They replied quickly and were super friendly. They even checked in a week later to make sure everything had arrived and that I was happy with my purchase.

It’s rare to find a company that treats you like a real person, not just a number. MITOLYN’s team really made me feel valued and supported throughout my whole experience.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued — but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.

After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I’m honestly impressed.

This isn’t just another energy pill — it’s something different, and in this review, I’ll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it’s worth considering.

What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.

That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.

What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.

PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).

N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.

Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.

Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.

Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.

In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.

My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.

Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.

Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""

Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.

The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.

Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.

Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.

Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.

Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:

Clean, research-based ingredient list

No stimulants, no crash

Noticeable improvements after consistent use

Supports both mind and body

Manufactured with high quality standards

Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens

Cons:

Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)

Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements

Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)

Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:

Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep

Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness

Want better exercise performance and recovery

Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally

Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements

However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.

Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.

I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.

Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.

Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

[**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://f4c41es7hzdb9l3gmlr7zd1qfg.hop.clickbank.net/)

If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time — think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued — but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.

After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I’m honestly impressed.

This isn’t just another energy pill — it’s something different, and in this review, I’ll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it’s worth considering.

What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.

That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.

What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.

PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).

N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.

Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.

Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.

Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.

In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.

My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.

Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.

Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""

Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.

The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.

Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.

Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.

Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.

Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:

Clean, research-based ingredient list

No stimulants, no crash

Noticeable improvements after consistent use

Supports both mind and body

Manufactured with high quality standards

Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens

Cons:

Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)

Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements

Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)

Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:

Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep

Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness

Want better exercise performance and recovery

Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally

Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements

However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.

Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.

I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.

Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.

Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time — think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

I promise, it... just hits a speed bump on the way there. Communication issues are silly, huh?

Summary: You are staying late at your friend's place after the surprise birthday party you threw for them. You have been best friends for quite some time, and you have caught feelings that only grew over this past year. It's so frustrating watching them get closer to another in the friend group, and it's obvious they have a crush on them!... or do they?

\[sounds of water running as the seeker and listener clean dishes\]

While you are over there, can you grab those half-empty bowls? 

…

Don't mention it! I am happy to stay a bit and clean up. It's your birthday anyway. I would feel bad if I watched everyone trash your place only to leave you without even a bit of help.

…

Even if it \*is\* past midnight, we haven't gone to sleep yet, so in my mind, it's still your birthday

…

Did… did you enjoy the party at least? I feel bad using the spare key you gave me to surprise you like that, in your own home and all… but I felt like you would enjoy it... right?

…

(sigh) Good. I'm relieved.

…

Of course, I was worried! Throwing a surprise birthday party is stressful. On top of the usual party planning, we also have to keep everything secret, so its just adds more complications. Half of the battle was making sure John did not spoil everything and let it slip, since he works with you, he was struggling. 

…

We all knew he wouldn't be able to keep up the act, he's awful at lying. So we just told him to avoid talking to you.

…

You had a feeling huh… no wonder you weren't that surprised when you got home. But you had fun… so, no harm, no foul. 

…

Sorry to spring this on you now… but… can I possibly stay the night? I feel like I had a bit too much to drink… With all the stress of the party planning behind me, I probably had one too many and I don't think I should be driving.

…

Thank you. As reliable as always.

…

You are reliable. You are an amazing friend. I don't think all these people would have shown up tonight if you didn't matter to them. You talk about yourself like you have a chip on your shoulder, and I hate it. I will happily remind you that you need to be kinder to yourself. 

…

I am going to keep saying it till you believe it yourself. Just like how you helped me stop apologizing for everything that was out of my control, I want to do something for you too. I want you to make progress towards changing as well, but the change has to start with you.

…

Good! Then we will start with this. Repeat after me, “I am a cute and lovable person who cares deeply about my friends. I try hard to make them feel appreciated. I am a great friend.”

…

Hey, that's not what I said at all! This isn't about me, it's about you! YOU are a great Friend, not me. 

…

This was my party, but I wouldn't do this for just anyone. 

…

I have plenty of examples for why you are a great friend. Remember that time that Alex got blackout drunk at the {boys’/girls'/Friends’} night out and you drove across town at 2 in the morning just to pick us up and make sure everyone was okay? How about that time you got everyone together for a camping trip that was so fun it became a yearly tradition? How about the time you spent all day at Quin’s house comforting him after his breakup with his 5-year relationship because their partner cheated? How about the time you- 

…

Hahaha of course I can keep going! You downplay the things you do. The whole friend group is closer to family than friends, only because of you. To say you are the lynchpin of the friend group would be an understatement. 

…

Today’s appreciation for you isn't over quite yet. \[sounds of putting away the last few dishes as you finish\] I have an extra gift for you. Imma crash on your couch, so let's go to the living room. We’ll end the night with our usual show. I haven't watched it since the last time I was over and it will help me destress.

…

\[retrieves the gift and walks into the living room and sits down next to speaker\]

Before you start our show, here. An extra gift for you. I wanted to get you something a bit more personalized since you helped me out of a dark place over this last year and I don't think I expressed to you enough how much that meant to me. Your support is why I was even able to get out of my slump and how I was able to push past my failures. Sooo, this is my thank you for all that you do for me. Go ahead, open it.

…

You like it? You're a bit quiet… huh, hey, why are you crying?! Is it bad, I can get you something different if you dont lik-

…

\[listener quickly hugs speaker\]

And now we are hugging. Does that mean you like it? And that these are tears of joy, and not tears of ‘this idiot actually thought I would like this’?

…

I don't know! I was pretty confident you would like it till you started crying and then I panicked. I - It's been a while since the last time I saw you cry, I just… I couldn't think of anything but it being my fault.

…

Hey! That's rude! Don't tell me it's my fault, even if you're teasing. I'll feel bad. 

...

But, I'm glad you like it.

… … … \[long pause \~5-10 sec\]

So, how are things going?

…

No, not in general, in your relationship search? 

…

Well good! I am glad you finally have a crush, but I worry about you. 

…

Hmmm, how to explain it. Sometimes I think you're a mirror image of that character in this show. The one, with the sharp teeth that is kinda an asshole.

…

Yeah, yeah, that's the one. You are like them. When you fall in love, you tend to chase your person single-mindedly. You go so far and above what is needed to just try and catch their attention or have some of their time. You join clubs, make hangout plans, get into new hobbies and even go out of your way to make sure they feel comfortable. It's so sweet but honestly, it's hard watching all that effort rarely bear fruit. You deserve someone who appreciates that part of you, not takes advantage of it.

…

Oh yes, you are still like that. 

…

If you are adamant that you've changed, what about our last outing? (teasing tone) You were \*so\* obvious. Even if you made your rounds talking to everyone, we both know who you wanted to hang out with most that night… and who you lingered around.

…

Yes, it was that obvious.

…

Listen, it's okay, I just wish they returned your feelings. You deserve that much (sigh) whatever, I'm going to get something to snack on, want anything? 

…

Sure I got it- AH \[speaker trips on the corner of the couch and falls towards the coffee table but listener grabs them to try and course correct. Both end up in a pile on the floor. Listener is on top of speaker.\]

…

Holy shit, I almost landed on the coffee table. Thank you for that. You saved me there (voice drifts off)

…

(voice soft and sultry) yes, I'm okay. I promise. You… you can get off of me now, I can't get up with you over me like this. I'm…not hurt. i… 

… … …\[Long pause \~5-10 sec\]

I… didn't hit my cheek in the fall, so I don't know why your hand is rubbing it... 

Don't look at me like that... 

You're so close…

…

You… look great tonight and when you look at me like that… it makes me hot… I can't think straight when looking at your lips this close... it makes me want them on mine.

\[3 kisses. Interrupted as listener gets up quickly\]

Woah, is everything okay? 

…

Sorry? For what, you didn't do anything wrong, it was just a kiss.

…

Yes, it was ‘just a kiss,’ you didn't cross any lines, I.. I invited that so if it's anyone's fault, it would be my own. If you got wrapped up in the moment and did something you didn't mean to, it's okay. I might be a little hurt but it's okay. 

…

Huh? Now I'm confused. What are you talking about? Me? Dating? But I'm not dating anyone right now? Where did you get that idea from?

…

Keeping it secret? No!? I don't have a secret relationship? Hey! Where are you going, we need to talk about this.

\[both walk over to Listener’s room as they opens the door and turns around\] 

…

Stop apologizing and just explain to me. Why do you think I am hiding a secret relationship? 

…

Wait… you saw that! Yeah, Blake confessed to me a few months back but-

…

Let me finish. You must not have seen the whole thing or heard what we said because I rejected them. I don't have feelings towards them like that.

…

Yeah, I have still been hanging around Blake. They ***are*** still in the friend group after all. More importantly, they took it surprisingly well. Blake was aware I had someone I liked, and they told me they confessed so they could start the process of moving on. They expected to be rejected.

…

Yes, I do have someone I like. Someone I have been pining after for years now. Someone I could never have because they always liked someone else. Anyone else but me. And this time, they fell for someone in our friend group. I had to play wingman to my crush… to you. I wanted you to be happy, I really did! Even if that ment being with Jordan instead…. I buried my love for you so you could finally have someone who treated you like you deserve. But if that kiss means you are starting to doubt your feelings, and I might have a way into your heart, I won't miss this opportunity. I even lied about drinking too much tonight just to have the chance to be near you for longer.

\[Speaker pushes listener into their room and onto their bed, straddling them\] 

So please, tell me it's me you love and not them. I wouldn't even mind if you lied to me as long as I could live in this moment for even a bit longer.

…

You… don't love Jordan?  How? You have been spending so much time with them these last few weeks. Even at the party today, you sat next to them when we were giving you gifts. They were being so touchy with you too, so I'm sure Jordan likes you!

…

Jordan was giving you advice to get with me? but …but… they were so touchy-feely with you and flirty. 

…

Jordan is trying to get with Blake?! And your advice was to try and make them jealous? Ahahaha aren't we just a group of idiots. 

…

But that means my confession… you, you feel the same? You love me? Not as a friend, but more. You’d want to keep looking me in the eyes so... needy? You’d want to keep kissing me?  Or… am I the only one that still wants you to do that?

…

Then kiss me and don't stop this time.

1ktudbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/revengestories/comments/1ktudbd/i_set_up_numerous_fake_dates_for_my_cheating/,I set up numerous fake dates for my cheating boyfriend,"8 years ago, I entered a relationship with someone who was almost too good to be true. He listened to everything I had to say, we had so much in common, I felt finally understood and really seen by someone as who I really am. I opened up to him more than I intended to, way too soon. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Now I know that what he did to me back then was love-bombing. Some examples of his techniques: the second month of dating, he took me to an uninhabited island with his small boat, set up a gorgeous lunch he prepared at home, served limoncello, we went diving and he found a giant shell and gave it to me as a token of his love. Shortly thereafter, he took me to his childhood home, showed me pictures of his parents who were deceased and gave me his old toy he claimed was his fondest childhood memory. I was sure he was the one.

However, soon things started to change. At first, it was the little things. He'd make a cynical comment here and there about the way I looked or sth I said and that made me feel very insecure. He'd flirt with other women in front of me to make me jealous. I'd cry and he'd apologise and temporarily revert to his old, romantic, loving self. But his outbursts became worse and worse, and the amount of pleading with him and convincing him of my love was growing each time. I felt exhausted and drained by the constant need to prove my love for him just to earn a little bit of affection he initially showed me. I once got out of the shower and caught him browsing an online dating site. He said he made sure I saw what he was checking out to see if I'd get jealous and controlling again. I didn't believe him.

He was actually very bad with computers and early on in the relationship, he once called me on the phone and asked for my help with setting up an online account for playing chess. I tried to guide him through the process of setting up a username and password at this particular site, which was somewhat more complicated than these things usually are and he grew impatient and just told me the username and password he wanted to use. I remembered that and tried this username and password on the dating site he visited. I immediately got into his profile and what I saw broke me. Not only was he chatting up other women, but it was clear from some of the conversations that he had met other women and had sex with them. Some of the conversations contained intimate information about me and what he was dissatisfied with me. What I read hurt so much that I cried on the floor like a little baby. By this point I knew he wasn't perfect and that our relationship was far from perfect, but I was clinging to that initial phase of our relationship which made me feel the happiest I had been in my life. Now I had to deal with the fact that it was all fake.

I cried for hours and then something in me broke and I decided to get even. I set up a fake online dating profile, the first of the many to come. I started chatting with him and after a few days, he suggested meeting. I feigned hesitation. He insisted. I reluctantly agreed to meet him in a large coffee house. I went there, half-disguised and sat where I knew he wouldn't see me. I half-hoped that he wouldn't come and that it was all just a bad dream. I called him 10 minutes before the meeting with the mystery woman to ask where he was and if we could meet, he said that he couldn't because he had an errand to ran. My heart sank. I kept my eyes glued to the door and sure enough: there he was. He came in, sat and waited. At first, I thought I was getting a panic attack because I was so distraught, but I managed to calm myself down. He first waited patiently, then started fidgeting and looking at every woman that came in. And then, as if by divine intervention, a woman came in who looked just as what I described ""myself"" online. He immediately came up to her and said something, she dismissed him, but he was persistent, at which point she got agitated with him and told him to leave her alone. He waited for another half an hour and then left. That afternoon I sent him a message through the dating site that I was indeed the woman he spoke up to, that I saw him, found him physically unattractive, but lacked the courage to discuss it in public, so I faked not knowing who he was. I apologised profusely and he said it was ok, no hard feelings. But I knew it wasn't okay. He was very self-aware and narcissistic, no way he was unbothered by that.

So I did it to him again. And again. And again. Sometimes he'd be stood up, sometimes the woman would reschedule and then he'd be stood up, sometimes she'd cancel at the last minute. At least ten dates went south.

I decided it was enough and that it was time to break up. I did it in public. I told him it was over because he was a cheating s-o-b. He denied everything and tried to gaslight me and spin the story as me being the jealous freak. I then looked at him and said: ""All those failed dates? All me."" and I just let that sink in. He asked how and I told him his password and left.

A few months after the break up, he wrote a lengthy e-mail saying that what I did to him was ingenious, that it proved I was the love of his life and that he completely lost the will for online dating because he both fears and hopes that every new woman is me. I never answered this or any other attempt he made to contact me. And he still makes such attempts even now, years later.",132,1748033831.0,revengestories,18,0.95,False

So this is my baby #2. My baby #1 is 15 months(so not too long ago) 

Please see the numbers below:::

Baby#2       8.8.                     9.4.              9.1 

So I failed my glucose test with baby 2 today and the cut off is 9.0 
My numbers were higher with my first baby and I passed somehow. 
My fasting numbers for both the babies and tests were okay.

I’m wondering has this happened with anyone before? 

Also, I’d like to add that I ate lots of donuts and vanilla iced coffees and sugary stuff the entire week before the baby#2 test. 

Any insights would be helpful tia!

I thought tripod stand might work but I measured the height of it and its lower than my couch, so I wouldn't be able to place it right behind the couch in the center meaning I would need to use keystoning, and same thing with gimbal stand, I can place it on the coffee table in front of the couch, but would probably require heavy keystoning, so kinda stuck here?

Some background. I am a 46 year old F. 5'9"" and SW 162 CW 158 GW 140. I've gained about 10 lbs in the past year as perimenopause has set in. I've always been active, and my food choices have been so-so. I've done a lot of rounds of the Whole30 but have never been able to make anything stick. Lots of yo-yo dieting along with lots of cardio. I've done several marathons over the last 5 years. I've found it hard to say no to treat meals and 2-3 glasses of wine 2-3 nights a week. I've gotten to the point in my life where I can't outrun a bad diet. My goal weight is to be at 140, which is healthy and attainable. About 2 years ago I was at 145.

I decided to try Hers after stumbling across  an ad on social. At first I felt really scared and really guilty. I still haven't told any of my family that I am doing this because I think they'd probably roll their eyes at me.

That said, I have had very few side effects and I have followed my instructions completely.

Week 1: buproprion x 1 (I take in am) and 1/2 topriamate every other day (I also take in am with bup)

Week 2: buproprion x 1 and 1/2 topriamate every day (both in am)

Week 3: burproprion x 2 in and 1/2 topriamate (both in am) and metformin and 1/2 topriamate in pm (I take at dinner)

I'm two days into week 3. I haven't had any anxiety. Just since upping my topriamate in the past two days I've had some tingliness in my feet at night. No constipation. I've felt a few waves of nausea at the beginning of each new week and upping meds, but nothing that water and some wintergreen lifesavers can't get me through. Diet soda and carbonated drinks don't taste great anymore, but that's OK. I'm super thirsty, so I'm drinking more water which is good for me anyways. I found that I'm naturally drinking less coffee - usually one cup now instead of three. I haven't been drinking alcohol at all- I haven't really craved it but I'm also kind of afraid to. And I don't want to disrupt progress. I'm definitely not as hungry but it seems like it's helped me to stick to my goals - which is probably what everyone is referring to when they say it's reducing food noise. I haven't lost a ton of weight fast, but I also realize that slow and steady is more sustainable.

Anyhow, wanted to share my experience so far since it's been better than expected and not full of horrible side effects. I'll keep this updated with progress or other notes. Happy to answer any questions, too.",2,1748033225.0,HersWeightloss,0,1.0,False

Is it weird that part of me is relieved to know that I wasn't crazy and paranoid: I was actually right ??? 

I feel like such an idiot, all the signs were right there but I was just SO trusting that I saw right past them until the red flags were so obvious even a colourblind person couldn't miss it. 

He'd call and text her all the time, they were gym-buddies, she's come to our place when I was at work just to ""pass by and say hello"". I once invited her for dinner at our house and he asked her to help him with the dishes as if I wasn't right there and it wasn't OUR house and he wasn't MY boyfriend. They'd go out for coffee and lunch every now and then and I was just happy he had a good friend to hang out with.

I'm kind of at a loss, it doesn't feel real. I just don't understand why he'd do this. I work hard, I always make sure to know how much I love him, I clean, I get along with his family... How do you come to terms with the fact that you weren't enough for someone you gave everything to ? 

Anyways, so yeah.  just got confirmation that my suspicions are actually reality. What's worse it (Just my luck) we're day 1 of a two-week family holiday and I don't think I have it in me to turn this into a scandal in front of my parents... It'd just feel humiliating, I don't even want to tell my friends about it.

Do I just wait it out ? I don't feel like seeing anyone at all right now- but I have to tell someone otherwise I feel like I'll just burst and lash out at him the second he steps into the room. ",22,1748033204.0,offmychest,11,0.9,False

I am myself a fellow VN lover and not only that, but I've decided to create one myself. 
I've got myself Renpy, Daz3d, Blender, Marvelous Designer and all sorts of complementary tools to get started with.
I'm of course on the learning path of these tools for the moment and I know it will take some time to acquire the necessary knowledge.
I already have the main idea of the story. As a matter of fact, I'm writing on a daily basis. I also have detailed description of several scenes and characters. And of course a playlist. 

So far so good... until recently when I found myself struggling to understand something.
To be more specific: 

- How are the scenes, locations like a coffee shop, house or city streets built for a visual novel? 
I've tried looking on different asset stores, but I couldn't find what I need. 
Do VN makers build these scenes themselves? If yes, what softwares are used for?
I mean, mansions like the ones from BaD.. are these downloadable environments? I literally have no idea in this regard so any insights or help would be massively appreciated. 


I hope my concern here makes sense..

Many thanks in advance for any help.

Cheers!

A scent you left, like memories that call.
You’d walk around, just chilling in the air,
Eating at the spots where kindness fills the air.

When all the things I dreamed would come to sight.
You stood by the pier, wishing you could see,
The moments shared, when it was just you and me.

We sang the songs that used to make us whole,
I still hear you, missing every note.
At age nineteen, I thought I knew it all,
But our first coffee date, I wondered if I’d fall.

Then the nights flashed by, the sunsets blurred,
You got me high, with words we never heard.
We said we needed nothing but each other’s touch,
But should’ve kissed you that night, that much.

Oh, how I hate goodbyes, they cut so deep,
But I refuse to cry, or let these feelings sleep.
This love may not be all, but it was pure and bright,
And though we let go, I still dream of you each night.

Maybe someday I’ll wake, and find you by my side,
No more farewells, never hiding what couldn’t hide.
For in my dreams, I still see us as we were,
And until that day, my heart will forever stir.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Doctor Andrew Scheele, Senior Researcher at the UN-VR Cooperative Institute of Integrative Xenobiology***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 28th, 2136*

My blinds opened in time with my alarm. An hour later, I was standing outside of Bemlin’s apartment with two granola bars in hand, one for each of us.

We arrived at the facility about 15 minutes early, or as Bemlin liked to say, “On time with time to spare”. I stopped by my office first thing. I had plenty of new emails and I didn’t burden myself with checking the exact number.

Of more immediate interest, a job had been put on my server last night. It was Acetli’s, and on closer inspection, it was her GenomIQ Lite AI she was focused on. I did a quick lookover of what she’d made it do, and found myself smiling.

Imbued with secondary purpose, I walked into the workroom towards the coffee machine. Acetli and Tanerik had since shown up for the day, each of them perking up an ear as I entered. “Good morning, you two. Want some coffee?”

“Good paw! I’ll take some!” Tanerik beamed.

“I ate on the way over, but thanks for the offer,” Acetli replied.

I started up a fresh batch. “You sure you don’t want some? Depending on how late you stayed last paw, a little boost might be helpful. How late did you end up staying, by the way?”

“Too late, but also not late enough, I feel like,” she said somewhat miserably. “I at least got the AI to run on your server. I don’t know if it worked or not.”

I was a bit dispirited by her mood, yet still intrigued by my brief peek at her results. “I just took a peek at that, actually. It looks pretty good!”

“You got results?” Tanerik asked, excited. “How many genes were being hidden?”

“Well, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We still have to go through a few things, but it is exciting regardless. Speaking of, Acetli, do you want to do that right now?”

“That’s fine,” she said, appearing immensely relieved, like she’d been wanting to since she woke up. Whether she actually was, she didn’t say it. “I’ve been very curious about it.”

I nodded. The splendid little machine completed its delightful process, and I poured a cup for myself and Tanerik. Acetli and I left for my office.

“I like the lights,” she said, taking a seat.

“Oh, yeah! Bemlin got them for me. They’re Christmas lights, but I’m probably going to leave them up until the bulbs burn out.”

“How long will that be?”

“If their advertising is to be believed, about two hundred thousand hours.” I turned my screen so she could see it. “Let’s take a peek at this. Mind mirroring your screen to my second monitor so it’s translated?”

She did so. Her first iteration was very promising; GenomIQ Lite had successfully given us a list of genes. Acetli scrolled down a little, apparently looking for something. I frowned at what I saw.

“Can you limit the results to only coding genes?” I asked. “We can look at noncoding and this other weird stuff later.”

“Fair enough. And… done. It… The program identified about nine-hundred *less* genes than what KeiVei-Lay does,” Acetli said.

I nodded, coming to the same conclusion with a quick mental calculation. “Which is actually *surprisingly good*… I’m impressed it worked so well.”

“What do you mean? It means it’s wrong. I regret saying it, but your AI isn’t as impressive as you made it out to be.”

I smiled. This side of Acetli wasn’t who I hired, but I still appreciated it. While her arguments came out rough around the edges, they were made with a healthy mix of scientific curiosity and skepticism. Perhaps I was being optimistic, but it felt genuine. I couldn’t fault her for pushing back at new methodology, not when she already accepted enough to sit in the same room as me. She would eventually come around. Or she wouldn’t, and I’d still happily discuss things with her.

“Which is why we’re going through it. Before we compare our list to KeiVei-Lay’s, I want to make sure it’s the best it can be… within reason.”

Her ears twisted. “And what exactly does ‘within reason’ mean?”

“It means I don’t have a PhD in statistics.”

We spent the better part of an hour looking at what the AI had done. We tried all sorts of things, from tweaking confidence thresholds to relaxing the AI’s attention to intronic density. At some point there were seven different jobs on my server at the same time.

We always came up short of KeiVei-Lay’s number of listed genes, though we did get a little closer with each iteration, to Acetli’s reluctant gratification. We also discussed at great length how the AI was coming to the decisions it did, and what each of the parameters we were changing did. Acetli always seemed to have a question to ask about something.

“Going back to the confidence scores, why is it set at the value it is?” she asked. “At this point, with nearly all my assumptions being proven wrong so far, I have to assume it *isn’t* arbitrary, as bad as that makes me feel.”

“I’m sorry to disappoint, but it is somewhat arbitrary. The math behind it isn’t, though.”

She sighed. “Should I even ask?”

I shrugged. “I mean, more information is never a bad thing, but it depends on your knowledge of statistics and how much foundation I’d have to lay for this. That said, you’re also asking the wrong person for an explanation of how exactly these scoring systems were developed.”

She turned to the screen, contemplating. “But it *is* arbitrary?”

“How about this? The program is effectively finding how gene-like a sequence looks. Some are less, some are more, and these fall on a curve. A bell curve, if that translates. The more gene-like it is, the closer it is to the center of that curve. The confidence threshold is just a cutoff value for how close we want a given prediction to be.”

Acetli had a contemplative look throughout my explanation. “So the arbitrariness comes from you? Whatever number you decide is ‘good enough’?”

“Yes and no. I can pick whatever I want, but I wouldn’t go below eighty-ish if I want to trust anything. And technically I should be applying a similar confidence rule to the confidence scores the AI gives.”

“Error bars of error bars?” she said, more exhausted than interested.

“Yeah, welcome to statistics… I usually left that sort of stuff to the dedicated numbers nerds at my previous jobs. Say, have you ever taken a biostatistics class? Or any statistics in general?”

She looked at me like I was an alien. “Life statistics? I haven’t… Well, I guess it is briefly touched upon, but all that stuff is left for computers.”

“Oh.” I frowned, not quite disappointed, but not quite satisfied either. “Then who’s responsible for making the math used in the programs you trust?”

“People who find that kind of stuff interesting. The kind who do a PhD and a postdoc researching *numbers*. You know, weird math people.”

Rather than letting any KeiVei-Lay-related wonderings take root, I simply snorted, amused. “Not a math person, huh?”

Her ears made an odd gesture I probably missed the meaning of. “Math’s the only reason I majored in biology and not another kind of science.”

“The only reason! So you went down the list, crossed out anything that had to do with numbers, and biology was the only field left? I’m sorry you were forced into this line of work.”

“Well, *no*,” she playfully scoffed. “I was only joking when I said that. Not doing extensive math is simply a bonus, not any real reason.”

“So what is the real reason?”

She simply held up her left arm, as if that explained everything. I could only smile, as it *did* explain everything.

I remembered wondering about the peculiar pattern on her arm when I first saw her at our interview. Most of her fur was on the darker end of gray, with the exception being her left arm—a patch of fluffy white clouds that started along her shoulder and part of her neck, creeping down her arm in splotchy gray and white streaks until it reached her all-white paw. If I squinted and turned my head, it was like looking at a section of a huge storm cloud.

It was an eye-catching pattern for sure, though to me, it was far more intriguing for reasons beyond visuals. There was a reason her cells were expressing those colors, but *why?* There were several possible explanations, each more interesting and rare than the last.

I picked the first one I thought of. “Developmental mutation in pigment alleles?”

“It’s a rare mu— er, yes…” She huffed, disappointed. “It’s less fun when I’m talking to someone familiar with genetics. Usually people are more impressed when I tell them.”

“Oh, sorry. If you want, I can pretend to not know anything about it.”

“It wouldn’t be genuine,” she dejectedly said.

“It’s still really interesting! Oh, and I bet most people don’t ask you about the exact mechanism behind it.”

“Are you actually interested?”

“Absolutely! I only briefly skimmed over pigment expression while I was looking over a xenobiology textbook a while back. Give me *all* the details.”

Her ears shot up. “You don’t want *all* of them, trust me. But essentially, the pigment in our fur, \[melanin derivative\], is made through a biosynthesis pathway that begins with phenylalanine. There’s a few different enzymes involved in the synthesis of \[melanin derivative\], and there’s also some that affect how it polymerizes, and there’s also different types that affect the specific color, and there’s *also* regulators that affect the ratios of these which determine the overall color observed.”

She paused for a response, but I gestured for her to continue. I’d have to look up what exact pigment she was talking about, though I was somewhat glad the translator didn’t give me the entire IUPAC name.

“Getting past all that, my genetic combination of these factors results in my normal cells making grey fur—no mutation. I happen to be heterozygous for the allele of an enzyme very early in the biosynthesis pathway, so I only have one functional copy. For my grey fur, one copy is all I need. At some point very early on, when I was just a pawful of stem cells, one of those cells made an error in replicating my DNA at the exact allele for that functional pigment-making enzyme.”

“Oh, wow! What are the chances of that? What kind of mutation was it?”

“It was flagged as a nonsense mutation. Early termination of the protein chain.”

“That’ll do it. I still can’t believe how rare that must be. To be heterozygous, and to have a replication error at the *exact* right spot at the *exact* right time in early development to have it spread down your arm in just that way.”

*What’s their DNA polymerase error rate? Is it higher than humans’? I wonder what the galaxy’s lowest error rate polymerase is. Excluding engineered proteins, of course. What genetics play into other fur patterns I see?*

I shook my head in an attempt to focus on just one thought. “If you don’t mind me asking, what do your parents look like?”

“My mother looks like me, pretty much. Minus the arm. My father’s fur is several shades lighter, though, with a few wavy patterns that are hard to spot. Actually, I used to have similar patterns, but they faded as I got older.”

I smiled. “So that was your motivation for getting into biology?”

Her tail swayed contently. “It was! I always half-thought about it, but it wasn’t until one of my classes in school that I really began to wonder about it. I was later begging my parents to order a few DNA sequencing kits so I could figure out what was up with my arm. They finally gave in, and we were able to see the exact allele that’s altered between my grey and white fur cells. None of us really understood it at the time, more of a novelty fun fact than anything. It wasn’t until a few years later in college that I had enough background knowledge to research the exact genes involved.”

“And here you are, a fully-fledged geneticist. That’s a great story! Jeez, I want to ask you about other kinds of cool things that are the result of genetics, but we would be here all day, quite literally.”

“I’ve actually been interested myself… Does Earth have any kind of outstanding genetic phenomena?” she asked.

“Hmm. The first example that comes to mind is with calico cats, if only because a colleague of mine was constantly showing me pictures of them lounging around their house. Anyways, their pigments—”

“Sorry, lounging around their house?” Acetli interrupted. “*That’s* what you do with them?”

“Yeah?” I dumbly remembered what the adorable balls of fluff were in any context outside of Earth. “Oh, *cats*. Wait, are you familiar with them? I thought… otherwise.”

She flicked her ears. “I learned about it from the news. Exterminators were rightfully taking care of some ‘Terran vermin’.”

I opened my mouth, then closed it. I would’ve liked to argue against pyromaniacs, but I found it hard to blame anyone involved. I could only think of those tiny, gerbil-looking aliens I forgot the name of. The exterminators were protecting against a genuine threat. On the other hand, the displaced owners of the cats wouldn’t simply… leave them. It was just a sad situation.

I straightened my posture before my back started aching. “Right. Um. Anyways, these calico cats, they uh, their pigments are linked to sex chromosomes, which lead to only females having a mottled coat.”

“Only females?” she said, eyes going wide. I was somewhat bothered by how unbothered she was at the subject of torching cats, but that was just me, a human. “That’s… interesting. What’s the evolutionary reason for that?”

“For these cats in particular, um, the pattern was artificially selected for.” I could see her expression faltering, so I quickly added, “But that’s not unique to only these animals! There’s plenty of other examples across Earth where color patterns are only expressed in one sex.”

Her half-drooped ears seemed to linger on the artificial selection aspect. “I see. I can’t immediately think of anything like that on Venlil Prime… Krakotl might have something similar with their feathers? Or maybe that’s the Duerten I’m thinking of? But what do you mean ‘artificial selection’?”

I thought for a moment on how delicate I had to be. “If you know of cats, I’m sure you’re familiar with the concept of pets? Domesticated companion animals?”

“One of many human, uh… *oddities*.” Acetli hesitated on the final word, like it was the most favorable descriptor she could think of.

“Well, to be blunt, while humans were in the process of domesticating animals long ago, they thought it was cute and or desirable to selectively breed them to have unique patterns on their fur.”

“Oh, so like directed evolution.” She blinked a few times. “I thought it would be much more… I don’t know. That just sounds like how plants are bred by farmers.”

“Domesticating crops and domesticating animals are essentially the same process. In the case of the cat, they became more friendly and docile with fur patterns being more of a neat side effect.”

“I guess that makes more sense,” she said. I tilted my head in a puzzled expression, to which she replied, “I sort of expected the opposite. You know, most people might expect predators to make their pet predators stronger, bigger.”

“Well…” I began, before quickly deciding *not* to prove her right at this very moment. “Consider it another, hm, what did you say? Oddity? Speaking of oddities, we have a few jobs the server finished running.”

“Oh, yes,” she said, straightening herself from her relaxed conversational position. She inspected the results on her holopad. “They… all have the same number of genes found?”

“And it’s up by twelve from the last ones we ran. Which brings us just shy of two-hundred away from what KeiVei-Lay identifies.”

“What about the few we had that overestimated the number of genes?”

“Those were with *very* lax conditions. And for our current purposes, I’d rather undershoot. Anyways, we haven’t significantly improved for a while, so I’d say this is good enough for now.” I stood up and grabbed my pad.

She also stood, but in a panicked sort of way. “W-Wait, why is an underestimation better? And good enough for what? Nothing we’ve done has gotten it to match!”

“We’re not looking for what *matches*. We’re looking for what *doesn’t*,” I said, walking out of my office.

Acetli followed me towards the workroom, where Bemlin and Tanerik were. “But… why? It failed!”

I waved a hand to Bemlin and Tanerik. “Hey! I figured you two might want to see the first look at our results. Interested?”

Tanerik leapt out of his seat to get a first look, while Bemlin merely turned his chair. Acetli’s expression had soured considerably. I cast her screen to the television on the near wall so nobody had to crowd around us.

“Sure, at first glance, it failed,” I turned to the white-armed Venlil, though raising my voice to address everyone present. “But we haven’t looked at the *overlap* between KeiVei-Lay and GenomIQ yet. Wouldn’t you want to know if it found, say, the gene Bemlin discovered?”

“Well…” Her ears twitched, as if she didn’t want to admit her curiosity. She tapped at her holopad, determined. “What’s its location on the genome again? I’ll check if it’s on the list.”

“Seven-hundred-ten-millionth, two-hundred-fifty-five-thousandth, one-hundred-twelfth base pair of the whole genome,” Bemlin immediately and flawlessly responded. I hadn’t even noticed his eyes glued to the television on the wall. “Third chromosome.”

Acetli blinked several times before shaking herself. “Could you repeat that?”

Where I would’ve written it down for her, Bemlin rattled off the number a second time. And a third, but much slower. He’d evidently committed the number to memory, which I wasn’t sure how to react to.

Acetli finished her search, and her ears drooped. “It… It found it.”

I felt my heart rate quicken. “Whoa, okay! Let’s run a larger search across the rest of it.”

“How do I do that?”

“Oh, um… Remind me to show you later. I’ll just quickly…” I lost track of what I was saying as I was dragging files and tuning selections on my holopad. I sent the job to my server and a few seconds later I had a very small list consisting of five genes—those that GenomIQ had found that weren’t present in KeiVei-Lay’s long-established list. I cast my screen to the television, overriding Acetli’s. “There! What do we think of that?”

“These are… *not* identified by KeiVei-Lay?” Bemlin asked.

“But still found by GenomIQ,” I agreed. *Five unknown genes… Could I make someone allergic to meat with five genes?*

“What’s so special about these ones?” Tanerik said, offhandedly.

“That is the question, isn’t it?” Bemlin replied.

I examined the five genes closer. At first glance, it appeared that One, Two, and Five were randomly dispersed across different chromosomes, but Three and Four were actually quite close together on the fifth chromosome. Even more interestingly, they didn’t have *any* introns recognized by the software.

The vast majority of eukaryotic genes had few to many introns, though they technically weren’t required for translation into a protein. In fact, the *absence* of introns made things quite simple for a cell to express the gene… perhaps abnormally so. I hesitated to call those two *artificial* so early with no hard evidence, but I was already thoroughly intrigued by them, more than the other three.

“What about these two?” I wondered out loud. “No introns. Maybe something interesting?”

“How are we even sure it’s working?” Acetli huffed. “It missed two-hundred other genes that KeiVei-Lay knows. These could be regions that just *happen* to have a few sequences the computer likes.”

“I mean… That’s almost exactly what the program’s doing. I guess it depends on how much evidence is enough for you. I could highlight the sequences it deems most important in the genes’ gene-ness for you. We could do a quick structure prediction and see if it’s realistic or a bunch of junk. A hundred different things, all before we even touched a pipette.”

Her expression seemed to wither, but she didn’t make a rebuttal.

“But isn’t that great!?” I said, spreading my arms. “We have *so* much to look at now! Which reminds me, Bemlin, what’s the progress on the function predictions of the first gene you found?”

His face was inscrutable. “By best predictions, it seems to be some kind of kinase protein involved in signaling. Unfortunately, I cannot say more currently.”

“Hmm… What about your program, Tanerik? Comparing it to the human proteome, or something? Any results?”

“Nope!” he enthusiastically answered. “It gave me a warning which I ignored, and then when I checked on it, it spit out a bunch of nonsense.”

I frowned. “What did the warning say?”

“Something about a frameshift error. The protein sequence got cut off, apparently, even though I double-checked that.”

I thought for a moment. “Did you make sure to convert the sequence to the *human* genetic code?” *Come to think of it, how is it going to react to the fact that methionine isn’t the Gojid start codon? Probably something minor, the middle parts are the most important. Worst case scenario, we replace the first residue with methionine.*

Tanerik’s ears wilted, now hidden behind his large tuft of wool. “Oh… I may have forgotten that. I’m used to KeiVei-Lay doing all that boring stuff. But now I’m gonna rerun it!”

“Put the job on my server, it’ll go quicker,” I replied, making a mental note to do a lot more research on what exactly their genetics curriculum involved.

The mental note didn’t stick, however, as I realized I was quickly running out of room for all the thoughts that were suddenly rushing through my head.

A lowly number of five genes—which could well have been artifacts of the AI—was barely something worth looking into. It was only when the broader context came into view that those five genes grew into something much, much more. From KeiVei-Lay’s use-it-or-get-discredited place among the galaxy, to its championed presence in genetics curriculums, to the fact that those curriculums also seemed to leave out critical aspects of bioinformatics, I had very good reason to believe that these five genes were *much* more than just a few strings of letters.

I stopped casting my holopad screen to the television and pulled up my notes. It didn’t seem my hand could follow my brain quickly enough, resulting in words written so hastily sloppy that the writing-to-text software was misinterpreting my handwriting. There was *so* much to do.

“But this is amazing!” I exclaimed, moving down to a fourth line. “It seems like such a tiny discovery, but it’s so exciting, isn’t it? By answering just one question, we’ve opened the door to a hundred others. This is just the first step.”

“I am glad you are excited,” Bemlin said, voice much drier than usual. “Acetli, could you upload this data to the shared workbook? I wish to look at these sequences under more scrutiny.”

The Gojid’s tone struck me down to reality. “Right. Make sure everything you do gets put in the workbook,” I mumbled, slowing down my writing.

I realized too late *what* I was so excited about. By every account, these five genes had been purposefully hidden by KeiVei-Lay. Five genes that, while not proven to be truly substantial yet, were still a reminder that something deeply fundamental had been taken from him. Bemlin never talked about it directly, a fact I noticed but never brought up with him.

Perhaps I ought to.

“So… what now?” Acetli asked.

I blinked a few times. “Now? Well, what do you think? What should we do first?”

“Make sure it’s not a fluke,” she confidently answered. “I want to check other species’ genomes using the same method we just did.”

Despite myself, I smiled. “That’s a great idea.”

*A dark myth of feral love, motherhood, and ancient hunger*
**By: Rowan Graves**


It all started shortly after my son’s third birthday.

He was a babbling star—bright, impossible not to love. He’d make up silly dances and say goofy things. Once he told me the moon was “better in two pieces.” Another time, he said star-dogs visited him in his dreams. He always made me smile. I laughed.  
Maybe I should’ve listened.

It was him and me against the world. The baby was a surprise—but never unwanted. A drunken, wild one-night stand with a gorgeous man, and nine months later came this screaming ball of love.

Blonde hair. Blue eyes.  
Nothing like me at all—genetics, right?  
Carried him, birthed him—and came out looking like a stranger.

And I would give him the world if I could.  
I’d burn it down, too, if he asked.

He talked early. Crawled early.  
Just… knew things, without needing to be taught.  
My little darling was a dream come true—  
The perfect child.

**Or so it seemed.**

He turned three.  
Something changed.  
He became something else—  
**Chaos.**

I thought at first it was normal toddler behavior. You know the typical: tantrums, independence, boundary pushing, exploring his sense of self.  
‘Threenager’ drama.

Then it became—something else. I thought I was going mad. Things would move in the house. I would look for a book, or a brush, and it would be in a different room.

Or my keys would be in the freezer instead of on the hook.  
But only stuff at home was moving, so maybe I was sleepwalking?

The air would feel heavy sometimes. Like the walls were listening. I started to notice whispers.  
Not real words, not at first. Just the hum of something almost being said.

I once found him crouched in the hallway before we left for the day, facing the corner, whispering to the crack in the wall.

“What are you doing?” I asked, expecting something silly.  

“Listening,” he whispered.  

“To what?”

I waited for a story about fairies or star-dogs.  
But he just smiled—**too wide**—and didn’t answer.

I told myself, *toddlers are weird*. It didn’t mean anything.

At work, everything seemed normal. I was focused. Sharp. Climbing the tech ladder—coding my way into a leadership position in the AI department.

So I figured it was just fatigue. Single mom exhaustion. Misplacing things at home, letting stress creep in.

But then the school started calling.

First it was the drawings—dark, disturbing things no three-year-old should understand. Twisted limbs. Sharp teeth. Eyes that bled.  
One showed me—only it wasn’t me. I was dressed in a black gown, a crown of antlers sat on my head. Behind me was a black shape—maybe a castle. And a giant dog with red drips from its fangs and yellow-gold eyes.  
He titled it: *“Mommy and Gar.”*

Then came the stories. Tales he told other children that made them cry.  
Shadowy forests. Something watching. A voice beneath the bed.  
He had apparently made up a story about an apocalyptic fire—lots of kids went home very upset. Parents too.

And then—**playtime turned ritual.**

He had the whole class ‘sacrifice’ their stuffed animals to him. Said he was the “Great Wolf King” and they had to feed the toys to his mouth *“before the moon cracked.”*

His teachers were concerned. Of course they were.

“What is he watching at home?”  
“Is he left alone often?”  
“Has he been exposed to anything… disturbing?”  

Then the hard questions:  

“Does he see his father?”  
“Is Dad around?”

I bit my tongue so hard I swore I could taste blood.

Because what could I say?

That his father was a beautiful stranger from a forgotten night, a name I barely remembered?  
That I hadn’t seen or heard from him since?

That no, my toddler wasn’t watching horror films or playing violent games—but somehow, still, he was drawing bleeding eyes and whispering about cracked moons and sacrifices?

I tried to talk to him, and his answers were riddles I didn’t understand. Half-dreams whispered in the darkness, formed into starlight.  
I was lost. None of the parenting books or sites mentioned this.

I called a professional—a child psychologist. The sessions seemed to help.  
I told myself maybe he was feeling something… about not having a dad.  
He was at that age—starting to notice the gaps.

I still couldn’t understand what had triggered it all, but at least he’d stopped drawing those pictures.  
Stopped the sacrifices.  
At school, anyway.

Things began to feel normal again.  
I rejoiced in the expected toddler behaviors.  
Tantrums. Whining. Endless “why” questions.

Then one night, I heard a crash outside his window.

I ran in, heart in my throat—  
But he was fast asleep.  
Curled up peacefully, clutching his favorite wolf plushie.  
He looked so innocent.

I told myself it was a dream.  
That I’d imagined the sound.

But then came the **voices**.

Not his.  
**Others.**

Whispering. Arguing. Rising in waves like a distant crowd.

At first, I thought it was the neighbors.  
But when I stepped out into the yard, the air was still.  
Silent.  
No lights. No people. No wind.

Just the moon and stars, hanging over the lawn like a million blinking eyes.  
It felt like they were watching—**waiting**.

My sleep began to suffer.  
I stayed up entire nights.  
Waiting. Listening.

The voices returned every few days—always between 2 and 3 a.m.  
Sometimes clearer, sometimes just a murmur.

Once, I heard someone say my name—**Helena**.  
Not whispered.  
Spoken.  
Calm. Certain. Male.

The voice curled into my mind—warm and inviting, like autumn fire.  
It tickled something deep in my brain. A voice I hadn’t heard since the night we made my son. A man I hadn’t thought of in years.  
A stranger too perfect to be real—red hair, golden eyes, a body like a myth.

Could it have been… him?

I never knew who he was. And if I’m being honest—I never really looked.  
He vanished with the sunrise, leaving only a hangover and a second heartbeat in my belly.  
I had convinced myself he wasn’t real—just a fever dream of whiskey and want.  
But now…

Now I wasn’t so sure.

Because that voice had **weight**. It clung to the curtains. Sank into the floorboards. It seeded dread in my heart—what if he wanted to take away my son?

I started to notice things again.

His toys—arranged in circles, always facing the window, like they were on guard.  
Salt spilled across the threshold of his door.  
A black feather tucked into the crack of the window frame.  
Mud and stick people holding swords made of toothpicks.

I confronted him one evening, trembling with coffee and exhaustion. It had been months since I slept the whole night.

“Why do you do that with your toys?” I asked.

He didn’t answer at first. Just kept coloring—dragging a black crayon in slow, spiraling loops around a sun that had been split down the center. A jagged line through its core.

“To keep the others out,” he said finally.

I swallowed.  
“What others?”

He looked up then. His eyes were so blue, but something had changed. I didn’t notice before now—there were **golden flecks** shimmering like some kind of ancient magic.  
Sadness.  
Fear.  
Resignation.

His voice was barely a whisper.

“The ones that want to lock me away.”

I didn’t know what to say to that.

How do you respond when your **three-year-old** speaks like a prisoner of war?

I reached for his hand, and he flinched. Not like a child afraid of punishment, but like someone bracing for a vision.

“No one’s going to lock you away,” I whispered. “You’re safe, baby.”

He didn’t respond. Just started coloring again. Now the sun was bleeding.  
Drips of red falling into the spirals.

“They will,” he said, voice flat.

**It wasn’t a question. It was a statement.**

We ran that night. No one was taking my child away. I took him across states, all the way to Canada. We would hide, start over. No one would touch him.

But no matter how hard I ran.  
How much I tried to change us. Hide us—  
The voices followed.  
Close.  
Angrier.  
More urgent.

His answers never changed.  
They were coming to lock him away.

Finally, exhausted from resetting our lives every few months for the last couple years, I sat down and asked my almost five-year-old the question that plagued me.

“Why, baby?” I took his little hand in mine. “Why do you think someone is coming to lock you away?”

He had been reading. He put his book down.  
Raised his face, eyes meeting mine.  
There was no more blue in them.  
Only molten **gold**.  
**When did that happen?**

They simmered in the red-orange dusk—**excited**.  
His smile widened, and I could see his **incisors sharpen**.

“Because, Mommy,” he said, voice too deep.  
**Growling.**  
**Ancient.**

“I’m going to eat it all.”

I couldn’t breathe.

I stepped back.  
The look in my son’s eyes chilled me to the core.  
**Feral.**  
**Starving.**

“Eat it all?” I shivered, fear prickling along my spine.  
“Eat what, Fenrir?”

He stood and slowly walked to the window. The full silver moon hung low in the sky. His laugh splintered the world around us.  
The window cracked.  
The cupboards burst.  
The floor groaned like it couldn’t hold him anymore.

When he finally turned back to me, his golden eyes were glowing.  
The air around him rippled—heat waves off a summer pavement.  
His smile showed too many teeth.  
**Too sharp.**  
He laughed again—  
**The night sky shifted.**

I heard it, outside—panic, terror. Screaming. Alarms.  
Discordant chaos ringing through the still night.

His voice seethed.  
It felt like frost and fire wrapping around my heart.

I reached for my phone—to call who, I don’t know.  
My fingers never touched the case.  
My legs gave out.  
I fell to my knees, and all I heard was:

**“The world, Mommy.”**  
He grinned, hungry.  

**“I’m going to eat the whole thing.”**

1kttyyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1kttyyo/12_unwritten_rules_of_a_marriage_or_relationship/,12 Unwritten Rules of a Marriage (or relationship generally),"I ran across this content and felt like this is the perfect place to share it so that we can all become better versions of ourselves for our own sake and that of our partners.

**1 - Listen to Understand (not to win)**  
The goal of a conversation shouldn't be to prove a point. It should be to connect. When your partner is speaking, pause, the instinct to defend yourself or correct them. Just listen. When someone feels deeply heard, their guard drops. Arguments shrink. And the relationship becomes a safe space again.

**2 - Assume Positive Intent**  
It's easy to take things personally in a relationship. But when you assume your partner meant well, even when they mess up, you create room for growth instead of blame. Most hurtful moments come from stress, fear, or misunderstanding, not malice. Choose grace over suspicion. It changes everything.

**3 - Communicate Needs Directly**  
Hoping they'll just get it leads to silent resentment. The truth is, even loving partners can miss signals. Be honest about what you need. More reassurance? More time? More space? Say it with love and clarity. A strong relationship doesn't avoid needs; it learns how to meet them.

**4 - Validate Before Problem-Solving**  
When your partner is upset, don't jump to fix it. Slow down and feel it with them. A simple ""That makes sense"" or ""I can see why that hurt"" goes further than advice ever could. Validation builds emotional safety. Solutions come more easily when the heart feels seen first.

**5 - Repair Quickly After Conflict**  
Every couple fights. That's normal. What matters is how quickly you come back together. Apologize first. Reach out. Don't wait for the perfect words. Just choose closeness over ego. It's not about keeping score. It's about protecting the bond you're building

**6 - Be Curious, Not Critical**  
Judgment shuts people down. Curiosity draws them out. Instead of ""Why would you do that?"" try instead ""Can you help me understand what you were feeling?"" When you get curious instead of critical, you make your partner feel like it's safe to be fully known, even in their flaws.

**7 - Prioritize Emotional Safety**  
Without emotional safety, love feels like walking on eggshells. Your partner should feel free to share hard truths, messy emotions, or deep fears without worrying they'll be attacked or abandoned. Emotional safety is the foundation for trust, intimacy, and healing.

**8 - Love is a Practice, Not Just a Feeling**  
Feelings change. Some days, love comes easy. Other days, it's a choice. Real love shows up in the effort: the check-ins, the hugs, the patience during tension. If you treat love like a daily practice instead of a passing emotion, the connection only gets deeper.

**9 - Don't Go Against Your Partner in Public**  
Even if you disagree with your partner, there's a time and place for it, and it's not in front of other people. Correcting or calling them out publicly makes others feel like they can disrespect them too. Protect your relationship's dignity in public. Bring the disagreements home.

**10 - Celebrate the Small Moments**  
It's not the anniversaries or grand vacations that keep love alive. It's the way they bring you coffee, kiss your forehead, or remember your favorite snack. Don't wait for big moments to show appreciation. The small stuff is the real glue of intimacy.

**11 - Repair is More Important Than Perfection**  
You will hurt each other. That's the part of being human. What matters most is the courage to admit it, talk about it, and try again. Love doesn't ask you to be flawless. It asks you to take responsibility and grow from the mess and chaos together.

**12 - Your Nervous System Is Part of the Relationship**  
When you're anxious, shut down, or emotionally flooded, your partner feels it. Your tone, your energy, your presence...they all speak before words do. Learning to regulate your nervous system isn't just self-care... It's what makes you safe to be close to.

1kttyrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1kttyrk/does_the_blackdecker_2slice_toaster_truly_deliver/,Does the BLACK+DECKER 2-Slice Toaster Truly Deliver? Comprehensive Review Inside,"The **BLACK+DECKER TR0002B 2-Slice Toaster**, with its toast shade selector, removable crumb tray, and auto shut-off, has been an interesting addition to my daily breakfast routine. Being someone who takes their toasts seriously, I have put this gadget through its paces to see if it truly lives up to the convenience it promises. It doesn’t just toast bread; it has a way of making mornings just a little brighter, or, should I say, toastier.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design is sleek and compact, making it a good fit for my tiny kitchen counter. Its black plastic exterior offers a minimalist aesthetic that fits without being too obtrusive in your kitchen setup. It’s lightweight but doesn’t feel flimsy, weighing just 2.31 pounds. While the plastic build could give off a less premium vibe compared to stainless steel alternatives, it does the job just fine for a toaster at its core. The small footprint, with dimensions measuring 9.84"" x 5.51"" x 5.12"", makes it ideal for those short on counter space.  

**Easy-to-Use Features and Toast Shades**  
What caught my attention from the get-go was the 7-level toast shade selector. Depending on my mood, I could go from a lightly toasted slice, perfect for a dollop of butter, to a dark, crunchy one that's great with peanut butter. Selecting the shade is simple, and the toaster doesn’t seem to miss the mark much when it comes to consistency. This machine really caters to toast perfectionists. However, the adjuster knob could feel slightly loose for some users; I found that it might shift slightly if you're not careful.

[Grab BLACK+DECKER TR0002B at the best price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b0dyl64bl7/)

**Performance and Consistency**  
The toaster's auto-centering guides are a surprisingly effective feature. I’ve tried toasting thinly sliced sourdough one morning and some thick bagels the next, and the guides positioned them correctly each time. Even toasting on both sides was consistent, which is not something you can guarantee with every two-slice toaster out there. However, the wattage at 750 watts might result in slightly longer toasting times compared to higher-end models with more power.

**Hassle-Free Cleaning**  
The removable crumb tray simplifies cleaning in ways I didn’t know I needed until I had this toaster. Sliding it out to dust off the breadcrumbs makes a world of difference, especially for someone like me who avoids scrubbing kitchen equipment like the plague. This feature is particularly convenient when you use the toaster frequently and don’t want crumbs burning at the bottom. 

**Upsides**  
- Seven shade settings offer customization for toast preferences.  
- Compact and lightweight design, suitable for small kitchens.  
- Auto-centering guides ensure even toasting for various bread types.  
- Removable crumb tray simplifies cleaning.  

**Critiques**  
- Plastic exterior may not feel premium.  
- Toast adjustment knob could be sturdier.  
- Longer toasting times due to 750-watt power.  

**Safety Features You Can Count On**  
What really gave me peace of mind was the auto shut-off feature. One morning, I got distracted while preparing coffee, but the toaster turned off safely without burning anything. This makes it a good option for families or anyone who, like me, can be forgetful at times. The cancel button is another useful addition—sometimes you realize mid-toast that you don’t want it darker, and one press stops the process without fuss.

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing this toaster to some high-end models like the Cuisinart CPT-160 and Breville Smart Toaster, I noticed its price-to-feature balance is unmatched. Those options certainly look more premium and offer additional settings like bagel modes or defrost functions. That said, both also cost significantly more, while the BLACK+DECKER toaster effectively covers the basics at a budget-friendly price point. At the same time, it feels like a step up from no-name brands that often compromise even toasting or durability. 

**Value for Money**  
This toaster strikes a great balance between cost-efficiency and functionality. While it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of pricier competitors, it delivers reliable performance that justifies its price. If you’re someone who appreciates consistent toast without splurging on luxury brand appliances, this little machine has got you covered. Its affordability, coupled with essential features and ease of use, makes it worth the investment.

Since I'm fasting and I have to conserve my energy I'm more wise and don't get angry at random things and the annoyances of every day life. It's my brain telling me: don't get angry at this since it's going to consume too much energy. I think I also worry less. 

One thing that's helping me big time is high quality coffee at nice cafes/bars. I just go to a nice cafe during lunch time and just get fancy filtered coffee.

1kttsb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1kttsb0/santa_teresa_trip_review/,Santa Teresa Trip Review,"My girlfriend and I recently visited Santa Teresa for seven nights and San Jose for one night with two of our friends. We used this sub for a lot of our research. We'd like to provide some details related to the trip in hopes of helping others plan a similar trip. Please let us know what you think and feel free to correct any mistakes or add additional details! 

# Arrival:

We flew into SJO on a Friday afternoon. Our plane touched down around 2pm. Getting through customs and baggage claim went pretty smoothly. We rented a car with Budget. Once you're through customs and baggage claim there is a Budget desk inside SJO where they call somebody from the Budget rental facility located outside the airport to come and pick you up. Since it was rush hour on a Friday, it took \~50 minutes for the shuttle to take us from SJO to the Budget rental facility even though it was a \~1 mile drive. From plane touchdown to leaving the Budget rental facility it took \~2 hours mainly due to the traffic getting from SJO to the Budget rental facility.

# San Jose to Santa Teresa:

We decided to not take the ferry since we missed the 5pm ride and did not want to wait till the 7pm ride. We drove the entire way and arrived in Santa Teresa around 11:30pm. We stopped at the Taco Bell in Puntarenas to get takeout and use the bathroom. This was the perfect option for us to get some food without wasting too much time. The road conditions were fine for almost the entire ride. About a mile from our Airbnb there was construction near The Bakery in Santa Teresa and the roads were awful. This was probably the worst part of the trek, but we were able to follow some other vehicles through the mess. We dropped the rental car off the following morning at the Budget near Playa Carmen. Dropping the rental car off took longer than expected due to the construction right outside the Budget rental facility. Tolls accepted our credit cards on the ride from San Jose to Santa Teresa.

# Stay in Santa Teresa:

**Activities**

We stayed in Santa Teresa for seven nights. Our Airbnb was right down the street from Kooks. We really liked this location due to its proximity to the beach, grocery store, and restaurants.

For three of the days, we rented ATVs from Savannah Xtreme Tours. The cost was $60/day. We messaged them via WhatsApp to schedule a pickup then arrived the following morning. I'd recommend their services. We had a blast with the ATVs, and I would 100% rent them again. If you pay with card, it'll be more expensive.

One of the days we took the ATVs to the Montezuma Waterfalls. The ride was about an hour, but it was a blast with the ATVs. Once we arrived, we were greeted by some tour guides who we tipped to park and show us how to get to the waterfall. They were super nice. At the waterfall we were able to swim. I highly recommend visiting. Make sure you bring cash to tip the tour guides.

Two of the days we took the ATVs to Playa Hermosa. This beach was much calmer than Playa Santa Teresa and we were able to swim comfortably. The waves at Playa Santa Teresa were too high for us to swim. I'm not sure if it's always like this, but it's definitely something we overlooked. 

We watched the sunset a couple times from Playa Santa Teresa. The beach was very lively at this time of day.

Two of the days we went to the Santa Teresa Lifeguards Gym. It cost $10/person to use the facility. They accept cash and PayPal. Working out in this gym was a really cool experience. They had plenty of equipment and it wasn't too packed.

**Food/Drink**

For dinner we ate at Kooks, Satori, Soda Soy Tico, Eat Street, and Amici. We thought the food scene was incredible and enjoyed every meal. Our favorite of the trip was either the sushi from Satori or the pizza from Amici.

For breakfast/lunch we ate at The Bakery, Eat Street, Vermu, Good Munchies, and Aroma. I ordered a breakfast burrito from each place and although I enjoyed each one, I would rank them as follows...

1. The Bakery
2. Good Munchies
3. Vermu
4. Aroma
5. Eat Street

For happy hour we got drinks at Kooks and Eat Street. We went to Kooks nearly every day since it was so close to the Airbnb. The service there was great, and it was a good spot to hangout. Eat Street had some shockingly good cocktails. Both Kooks and Eat Street had good happy hour deals.

In addition to getting coffee from the breakfast/lunch places listed above, we also went to El Somos Cafe which ended up being our favorite.

Some of the grocery stores we went to were Super Ronny's 2 and Super Costa Market. We didn't shop much but both places had the essentials that we needed.

# Santa Teresa to San Jose

On the following Friday we traveled from Santa Teresa to San Jose. We left Santa Teresa shortly after 8am and took the 12pm ferry. Again, it took longer than expected to pick up the rental car due to the construction. We bought the ferry tickets beforehand. Once at the ferry terminal we just joined the line of cars and waited for an attendant to come up to our window. The ferry took off a little late and we arrived in Puntarenas at \~2pm. Due to the San Jose traffic, we didn't arrive at our Airbnb until \~530pm. I'd highly recommend taking the ferry, but I'd do everything possible to avoid the San Jose traffic.

# Stay In San Jose

The night before flying home, we stayed at URBN Escalante through Airbnb. Check in was easy and they provided us with a parking spot for our rental car. Right down the street there was a food court/hall called Lolita. Lolita was a really cool spot to hang out and get some food/drinks.

# Review

Overall, we had a wonderful time in Santa Teresa. We all really enjoyed being able to rent ATVs and use these to get around. The food options really blew us away. Even though some of the roads were unpaved/dusty and didn't have sidewalks, this never bothered us. Everybody we encountered was nice. The beaches and other scenery were beautiful. We really enjoyed the laid-back vibe of the town.

# Recommendations

* Use Budget if you need to rent a car. The workers at the SJO and Playa Carmen locations were pleasant to work with.
* Take the ferry if driving from/to SJO/Santa Teresa.
* Rent ATVs when in Santa Teresa for at least a day.
* Visit the Montezuma Waterfalls. Bring cash.
* Try to avoid driving in San Jose during rush hour.
* Eat at as many different restaurants as you can. The quality and proximity of restaurants should be taken advantage of.
* Take advantage of good weather. We lucked out with the lack of rain but one afternoon it came out of nowhere and rained the rest of the night.
* Visit Playa Hermosa for swimming.
* Buy some Lizano sauce from the grocery store.
* Drink a million Imperials.
* Be aware that Playa Santa Teresa might be too rough for swimming. 
* Be aware of the construction going on right outside The Bakery and Budget rental facility.

1kttrq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kttrq7/hr_death_and_groundsquirrels/,[HR] Death and Groundsquirrels,"We begin our story two weeks before the great snowstorm, on a branch of that one big tree, not too far from here, that one placed on a little hill in a forest, where two groundsquirrels were just about to enter their new home, which was located inside the trunk of the tree. One of the groundsquirrels, the one whose name was on the lease, who we will call Peter, had a knapsack full of nuts. With his tiny groundsquirrel paws, Peter put the key in the keyhole and entered the house, together with the Groundsquirrel who went by the name Anna.

Anna and Peter had met at dance class and had gotten married just six months ago, in an empty field in the middle of the forest. Between now and then, the newlywed couple had spent a long time searching for a tree trunk they could occupy together. After a lengthy search, Peter received the news that his grandmother, the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, may she rest in peace, had unfortunately not made it through spring, and had left her tree-trunk house to the young couple.

Torn up by the news, Peter was secretly also relieved that they could finally stop searching for a place to stay (the housing market for Groundsquirrels is murder). His joy over the inheritance brought with it not just the guilt of feeling he hadn't spent enough time with the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, but also a strange kind of guilt about being happy with something that had come from loss. A guilt that made Anna feel Peter was one small tragedy away from completely snapping.

Whereas the outside of the house gave the impression of a cozy little gnome cottage, the inside leaned more toward something out of a murder cabin. On the floor stood an old couch and a replica of the carpet from *The Shining*, on top of which was a rug made from a horse (head and tail). There was also a couch, a record by Art Blakey, a cabinet, a hallway five meters long that led absolutely nowhere, another cabinet with a Sony CD player, a statue without arms staring directly into the bedroom, another couch, a bookcase filled with 29 copies of *If I did it* by pro NFL player, O.J. ‘’the Juice’’ Simpson, a photo album labeled “Gift Cards,” nine deer heads, a fire axe mounted above the fireplace, and six cuckoo clocks, none of which told the correct time, or even had synchronized second hands. The place also had a strange smell, which Anna, not incorrectly, attributed to the scent that all old Groundsquirrels tend to have when their time is near. The horror-movie-style interior of the little house unsettled Anna, who had recently seen *The Shinning* on TV in the middle of the night and now couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was about to attempt to murder her in this weirdly decorated house, and as will become clear later in this story, that feeling wasn’t entirely misplaced.

The bedroom was a bit more modest (read: normal) than the living room. Just a bed and a wardrobe. Since she had already moved in, Anna decided to unpack some of her stuff. So she walked over to the wardrobe in the bedroom, opened it, and found less space than expected. That was because the corpse of the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, may she rest in peace, was taking up half of it.

After seeing the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, Anna immediately slammed the wardrobe shut, then cautiously opened it again to confirm what she’d just seen. Once confirmed, she shut the door again. “Peter?” she asked, worried. “Wasn’t Grandma Groundsquirrel supposed to be buried?” “Yeah,” Peter replied. “You did see the casket go into the ground?” “Uh-huh.” “Then why is she here, in the wardrobe in our bedroom?” Peter walked over to the wardrobe and repeated the exact motions Anna had done thirty seconds earlier. “I think this *is* Grandma Groundsquirrel,” he said, surprised. “Who the hell put her in the wardrobe?... And who the hell was in the casket?” Anna asked, unsettled. “My guess is Uncle Guinea Pig just collected his inheritance and headed straight to the horse races instead of picking up the body,” Peter said. “Why would someone do that?” Anna asked, horrified. “She’s got to go. We can’t live with a corpse in the house. What if she starts rotting?” Anna pulled herself together. “You know what,” Peter said, “Tomorrow I’ll chop some wood and build her a coffin.” He gently tucked Grandma Groundsquirrel back into the wardrobe and closed the door. That somehow gave Anna despite the fact that Peter had never shown the slightest interest in DIY, a small sense of comfort. That evening, after tossing the rug into the fireplace, she went to sleep with the vague sense that the late Grandma Groundsquirrel was staring at them through the wardrobe door.

The next morning, when Anna left for work, Peter had already begun chopping wood for the coffin. When she came back that evening, she saw that Peter hadn’t just finished the coffin, but had, with the style of a funeral director with a sick sense of humor, attached four legs to the bottom, placed a tiny crocheted tablecloth and flower vase on top, and positioned it neatly as a coffee table by the couch. On the upside: the smell in the house had decreased. “Tadaa!” Peter said proudly, as if he’d just sawed a person in half, rather than built a coffee-table-coffin. “What *is* that?!” Anna asked, hoping Peter was joking. “We didn’t have a coffee table yet, right?” Peter responded. That question stunned Anna. “...Right(?)... Is she inside it? In that... coffee table(?)”. “Yep!!” Peter replied without any sense that this might be considered concerning behaviour.

Anna wanted the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, may she rest in peace, out of the house as fast as possible, she couldn’t imagine her being here in the state that she was at that moment (dead), was helping Peter with his grieving process, but she also wanted to be respectful of her groundsquirrel partner, who was clearly far deeper in mourning than she had realized. “Would you maybe... not... … Why?” “I just don’t think I’m ready to let Grandma Groundsquirrel go yet. Seeing her sitting there in the wardrobe made everything feel so final. Like I’ll never speak to her again, never just drop by on a random Thursday afternoon, never get a Christmas card, never sit and read illegally downloaded biographies of Lee Harvey Oswald together. I just want to keep her close a little longer.’’. Anna sort of understood where Peter was coming from, but didn’t understand why he couldn’t just use a stone or a little urn or something. Still, she was glad he was finally talking about his grief, a subject he’d been completely silent on since Grandma GroundSquirrel had kicked the bucket. “Let me know when you’ve... processed this,” she said, pointing to the coffin. “I’m going to bed.”

In the weeks that followed, the coffee-table-coffin had a rotating lineup of decorations, one day a flower vase, a picture frame, a teapot, three-day-old breakfast, a tablecloth; the next day just some candles. Anna refused to believe Peter’s therapist thought this was a good idea, but given that the only death she had experienced in her life (apart from that basketball game) was her great-great-grandma Groundsquirrel dying when she was just three months old, she concluded that grief must be more complicated than she’d thought.

We begin our story two weeks before the great snowstorm, on a branch of that one big tree—not too far from here—perched on a little hill in a forest, where two Groundsquirrels were just about to enter their new home, which was located inside the trunk of the tree. One of the Groundsquirrels—the one whose name was on the lease, whom we’ll conveniently call Peter—had a knapsack full of beech nuts. With his tiny Groundsquirrel paws, Peter put the key in the keyhole and entered the house, accompanied by the Groundsquirrel who went by the name Anna.

Anna and Peter had met at dance class and had gotten married just six months ago, in a clearing in the middle of the forest.

On the floor stood an old couch and a replica of the carpet from *The Shining*, on top of which was a rug made from a horse (complete with head and tail). There was also a recliner, a record by Art Blakey, a cabinet, a hallway five meters long that led absolutely nowhere, another cabinet with a Sony CD player, a statue without arms staring directly into the bedroom, another recliner, a bookcase filled with 29 copies of *Summer House with Swimming Pool* by Herman Koch, a photo album labeled “Gift Cards,” nine deer heads, a fire axe mounted above the fireplace, and six cuckoo clocks, none of which told the correct time—or even had synchronized second hands. The place also had a strange smell, which Anna—not incorrectly—attributed to the scent that all old Groundsquirrels tend to develop when their time is near.

When she came back that evening, she saw that Peter hadn’t just finished the coffin, but had, with the flair of a funeral director with a sick sense of humor, attached four legs to the bottom, placed a tiny crocheted doily and flower vase on top, and positioned it neatly as a side table by the couch. The upside: the smell in the house had lessened. “Tadaa!” Peter said proudly, as if he’d just performed a magic trick, rather than built a coffee-table-coffin. “What *is* that?!” Anna asked, hoping Peter was joking. “We didn’t have a coffee table yet, right?” Peter responded. That question stunned Anna. “...Right(?)... Is she inside it? In that... coffee table(?)” Anna pulled herself together. “Yep!!” Peter replied cheerfully, oblivious to how bizarre this was.

Anna sort of understood where Peter was coming from, but didn’t understand why he couldn’t just use a stone or a little urn or something. Still, she was glad he was finally talking about his grief—a subject he’d been completely silent on since Grandma Groundsquirrel had kicked the bucket. “Let me know when you’ve... processed this,” she said, pointing to the coffin. “I’m going to bed.”

In the weeks that followed, the coffee-table-coffin bore a rotating lineup of decorations—one day a flower vase, a picture frame, a teapot, three-day-old breakfast, a tablecloth; the next day just some candles. Anna refused to believe Peter’s therapist thought this was a good idea, but given that the only death she had experienced in her life (apart from that basketball game incident) was her great-great-grandma Groundsquirrel dying when she was just three months old, she concluded that grief must be more complicated than she’d thought.

That night, Anna was woken up in the middle of the night by knocking at the door. Outside, the wind howled against the little cabin. Anna looked at the clock, three o'clock. She slowly made her way to the front door. The knocking, unsurprisingly, grew louder.

The first thing she noticed upon entering the living room was that the already strange stench in the cabin had intensified slightly. KNOCK KNOCK. It sounded like someone was scratching at the front door. Anna glanced at the axe Peter had placed beside the coffin, which also doubled as a coffee table. She considered picking it up in case it was some kind of psychopath, or perhaps an strangely polite burglar, but ultimately decided not to. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Anna reached the door. She opened it and cautiously greeted the blizzard outside. She looked from left to right. Nothing but darkness surrounding their front porch.

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Anna slammed the door shut behind her. The sound was coming from inside the living room. Anna turned to look at the final resting place of the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, may she rest in peace, which was still functioning as a coffee table. She took a step back. It couldn’t be…

The body of the twice-late Grandma Groundsquirrel burst screaming through the tablecloth and stepped toward her on her undead, rotting Groundsquirrel paws. Anna screamed for help. Zombie Grandma Groundsquirrel was now about a meter away from her, between Anna and the wall. Anna grabbed *If I did it* by star NFL player O.J. Simpson and flung it at her no-longer-deceased mother-in-law.

Grandma Groundsquirrel barely reacted to the controversial non coffesion and continued onwards with her slow, screaming approach. With each step, she left little bits and pieces of rotting flesh on the floor. Anna kept throwing the other 23 copies of *If I did it*, and although they left dents and imprints on the creature’s decaying skin, the attacks proved useless.

Grandma Groundsquirrel raised her decomposed paw, now more bone than skin, and grabbed Anna by the throat. Zombie Grandma Groundsquirrel opened her mouth, which turned out to be the source of that elderly Groundsquirrel stench, and showed her teeth, ready to bite.

Grandma Groundsquirrel screeched. Peter swung the axe down, splitting the head of the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, may she rest in piece, in two. It now hung loosely from her neck, attached only by the bits his axe hadn’t reached. “Die!” Peter shouted.

The now-truly-lifeless corpse of the twice-late Grandma Groundsquirrel, may she rest in piece, collapsed to the floor. Peter made a half-hearted attempt to act cool, despite having just re-killed his reanimated grandmother. Anna hugged him. Outside, the sun had slowly begun to rise. The snowstorm still howled outside. Anna made eye contact with Peter. “What now?” he asked.

Anna tried to come up with a suitable answer to that question, and to the horrifying pandemonium that had just played out in front of her.

Then, the clocks on the walls all stopped ticking. The temperature inside dropped and without a creak or a sound, the door flew open.

A figure entered. A keen observer would notice that their feet don’t quite touch the floor. Though the snowstorm outside appears to have stopped, snowflakes still fly in behind him, settling quietly on the floor.

The figure walks over to the remains of the late Grandma Groundsquirrel and, one by one, closes her eyes. Then the figure pickes her corpse up and slings it over their shoulder. And just as suddenly as it had appeared, it exited the apartment and disappeared into the void.

The clocks starts ticking again. The storm had faded. It was a very uneventful Sunday morning.

These testimonials underscore Mitolyn's global impact, offering a natural solution for those seeking weight loss and enhanced vitality.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued — but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.

After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I’m honestly impressed.

This isn’t just another energy pill — it’s something different, and in this review, I’ll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it’s worth considering.

What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.

That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.

What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.

PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).

N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.

Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.

Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.

Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.

In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.

My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.

Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.

Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""

Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.

The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.

Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.

Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.

Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.

Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:

Clean, research-based ingredient list

No stimulants, no crash

Noticeable improvements after consistent use

Supports both mind and body

Manufactured with high quality standards

Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens

Cons:

Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)

Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements

Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)

Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:

Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep

Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness

Want better exercise performance and recovery

Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally

Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements

However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.

Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.

I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.

Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.

Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

1kttpy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1kttpy8/death_and_groundsquirrels/,Death and Groundsquirrels,"We begin our story two weeks before the great snowstorm, on a branch of that one big tree, not too far from here, that one placed on a little hill in a forest, where two groundsquirrels were just about to enter their new home, which was located inside the trunk of the tree. One of the groundsquirrels, the one whose name was on the lease, who we will call Peter, had a knapsack full of nuts. With his tiny groundsquirrel paws, Peter put the key in the keyhole and entered the house, together with the Groundsquirrel who went by the name Anna.

Anna and Peter had met at dance class and had gotten married just six months ago, in an empty field in the middle of the forest. Between now and then, the newlywed couple had spent a long time searching for a tree trunk they could occupy together. After a lengthy search, Peter received the news that his grandmother, the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, may she rest in peace, had unfortunately not made it through spring, and had left her tree-trunk house to the young couple.

Torn up by the news, Peter was secretly also relieved that they could finally stop searching for a place to stay (the housing market for Groundsquirrels is murder). His joy over the inheritance brought with it not just the guilt of feeling he hadn't spent enough time with the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, but also a strange kind of guilt about being happy with something that had come from loss. A guilt that made Anna feel Peter was one small tragedy away from completely snapping.

Whereas the outside of the house gave the impression of a cozy little gnome cottage, the inside leaned more toward something out of a murder cabin. On the floor stood an old couch and a replica of the carpet from *The Shining*, on top of which was a rug made from a horse (head and tail). There was also a couch, a record by Art Blakey, a cabinet, a hallway five meters long that led absolutely nowhere, another cabinet with a Sony CD player, a statue without arms staring directly into the bedroom, another couch, a bookcase filled with 29 copies of *If I did it* by pro NFL player, O.J. ‘’the Juice’’ Simpson, a photo album labeled “Gift Cards,” nine deer heads, a fire axe mounted above the fireplace, and six cuckoo clocks, none of which told the correct time, or even had synchronized second hands. The place also had a strange smell, which Anna, not incorrectly, attributed to the scent that all old Groundsquirrels tend to have when their time is near. The horror-movie-style interior of the little house unsettled Anna, who had recently seen *The Shinning* on TV in the middle of the night and now couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was about to attempt to murder her in this weirdly decorated house, and as will become clear later in this story, that feeling wasn’t entirely misplaced.

The bedroom was a bit more modest (read: normal) than the living room. Just a bed and a wardrobe. Since she had already moved in, Anna decided to unpack some of her stuff. So she walked over to the wardrobe in the bedroom, opened it, and found less space than expected. That was because the corpse of the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, may she rest in peace, was taking up half of it.



  


After seeing the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, Anna immediately slammed the wardrobe shut, then cautiously opened it again to confirm what she’d just seen. Once confirmed, she shut the door again. “Peter?” she asked, worried. “Wasn’t Grandma Groundsquirrel supposed to be buried?” “Yeah,” Peter replied. “You did see the casket go into the ground?” “Uh-huh.” “Then why is she here, in the wardrobe in our bedroom?” Peter walked over to the wardrobe and repeated the exact motions Anna had done thirty seconds earlier. “I think this *is* Grandma Groundsquirrel,” he said, surprised. “Who the hell put her in the wardrobe?... And who the hell was in the casket?” Anna asked, unsettled. “My guess is Uncle Guinea Pig just collected his inheritance and headed straight to the horse races instead of picking up the body,” Peter said. “Why would someone do that?” Anna asked, horrified. “She’s got to go. We can’t live with a corpse in the house. What if she starts rotting?” Anna pulled herself together. “You know what,” Peter said, “Tomorrow I’ll chop some wood and build her a coffin.” He gently tucked Grandma Groundsquirrel back into the wardrobe and closed the door. That somehow gave Anna despite the fact that Peter had never shown the slightest interest in DIY, a small sense of comfort. That evening, after tossing the rug into the fireplace, she went to sleep with the vague sense that the late Grandma Groundsquirrel was staring at them through the wardrobe door.

The next morning, when Anna left for work, Peter had already begun chopping wood for the coffin. When she came back that evening, she saw that Peter hadn’t just finished the coffin, but had, with the style of a funeral director with a sick sense of humor, attached four legs to the bottom, placed a tiny crocheted tablecloth and flower vase on top, and positioned it neatly as a coffee table by the couch. On the upside: the smell in the house had decreased. “Tadaa!” Peter said proudly, as if he’d just sawed a person in half, rather than built a coffee-table-coffin. “What *is* that?!” Anna asked, hoping Peter was joking. “We didn’t have a coffee table yet, right?” Peter responded. That question stunned Anna. “...Right(?)... Is she inside it? In that... coffee table(?)”. “Yep!!” Peter replied without any sense that this might be considered concerning behaviour.

Anna wanted the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, may she rest in peace, out of the house as fast as possible, she couldn’t imagine her being here in the state that she was at that moment (dead), was helping Peter with his grieving process, but she also wanted to be respectful of her groundsquirrel partner, who was clearly far deeper in mourning than she had realized. “Would you maybe... not... … Why?” “I just don’t think I’m ready to let Grandma Groundsquirrel go yet. Seeing her sitting there in the wardrobe made everything feel so final. Like I’ll never speak to her again, never just drop by on a random Thursday afternoon, never get a Christmas card, never sit and read illegally downloaded biographies of Lee Harvey Oswald together. I just want to keep her close a little longer.’’. Anna sort of understood where Peter was coming from, but didn’t understand why he couldn’t just use a stone or a little urn or something. Still, she was glad he was finally talking about his grief, a subject he’d been completely silent on since Grandma GroundSquirrel had kicked the bucket. “Let me know when you’ve... processed this,” she said, pointing to the coffin. “I’m going to bed.”

In the weeks that followed, the coffee-table-coffin had a rotating lineup of decorations, one day a flower vase, a picture frame, a teapot, three-day-old breakfast, a tablecloth; the next day just some candles. Anna refused to believe Peter’s therapist thought this was a good idea, but given that the only death she had experienced in her life (apart from that basketball game) was her great-great-grandma Groundsquirrel dying when she was just three months old, she concluded that grief must be more complicated than she’d thought.

We begin our story two weeks before the great snowstorm, on a branch of that one big tree—not too far from here—perched on a little hill in a forest, where two Groundsquirrels were just about to enter their new home, which was located inside the trunk of the tree. One of the Groundsquirrels—the one whose name was on the lease, whom we’ll conveniently call Peter—had a knapsack full of beech nuts. With his tiny Groundsquirrel paws, Peter put the key in the keyhole and entered the house, accompanied by the Groundsquirrel who went by the name Anna.

Anna and Peter had met at dance class and had gotten married just six months ago, in a clearing in the middle of the forest. Since then, the newlywed couple had spent a long time searching for a tree trunk they could occupy together. After a lengthy quest, Peter received the news that his grandmother, the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, hadn’t made it through spring, and had left her tree-trunk house to the young couple.

Peter was torn up by the news but secretly relieved that they could finally stop searching for a place to stay (the housing market for Groundsquirrels is murder). His joy over the inheritance brought with it not just the guilt of feeling he hadn't spent enough time with the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, but also a strange kind of guilt about being happy with something that had come from loss. A guilt that made Anna feel Peter was one tragedy away from completely snapping.

While the outside of the house gave the impression of a cozy gnome cottage, the inside leaned more toward something out of a murder cabin. On the floor stood an old couch and a replica of the carpet from *The Shining*, on top of which was a rug made from a horse (complete with head and tail). There was also a recliner, a record by Art Blakey, a cabinet, a hallway five meters long that led absolutely nowhere, another cabinet with a Sony CD player, a statue without arms staring directly into the bedroom, another recliner, a bookcase filled with 29 copies of *Summer House with Swimming Pool* by Herman Koch, a photo album labeled “Gift Cards,” nine deer heads, a fire axe mounted above the fireplace, and six cuckoo clocks, none of which told the correct time—or even had synchronized second hands. The place also had a strange smell, which Anna—not incorrectly—attributed to the scent that all old Groundsquirrels tend to develop when their time is near. The horror-movie-style interior of the little house deeply unsettled Anna, who had recently seen *The Shining* on TV in the middle of the night and now couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was about to attempt to murder her in this weirdly decorated house—and as will become clear later in this story, that feeling wasn’t entirely misplaced.

The bedroom was a bit more modest (read: normal) than the living room. Just a bed and a wardrobe. Since she was already moved in, Anna decided to unpack some of her things. So she walked over to the wardrobe in the bedroom, opened it, and found less space than expected—because the corpse of the late Grandma Groundsquirrel was taking up half of it.

After seeing the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, Anna immediately slammed the wardrobe shut, then cautiously opened it again to confirm what she’d just seen. Once confirmed, she shut the door again, firmly this time. “Peter?” she asked, worried. “Wasn’t Grandma Groundsquirrel supposed to be buried?” “Yeah,” Peter replied. “You saw the casket go into the ground?” “Uh-huh.” “Then why is she here, in the wardrobe in our bedroom?” Peter walked over to the wardrobe and repeated exactly what Anna had done thirty seconds earlier. “I think this *is* Grandma Groundsquirrel,” he said, surprised. “Who the hell put her in the wardrobe?... And who the hell was in the casket?” Anna asked, clearly unsettled. “My guess is Uncle Guinea Pig just collected his inheritance and headed straight to the horse races instead of picking up the body,” Peter said. “Why would someone do that?” Anna asked, horrified. “She’s got to go. We can’t live with a corpse in the house. What if she starts rotting?” Anna began to panic. “You know what,” Peter said, “Tomorrow I’ll chop some wood and build a coffin.” He gently tucked Grandma Groundsquirrel back into the wardrobe and closed the door. That somehow gave Anna—despite the fact that Peter had never shown the slightest interest in DIY—a small sense of comfort. That evening, after tossing the rug into the fireplace, she went to sleep with the vague sense that the late Grandma Groundsquirrel was staring at them through the wardrobe door.

The next morning, when Anna left for work, Peter had already begun chopping wood for the coffin. When she came back that evening, she saw that Peter hadn’t just finished the coffin, but had, with the flair of a funeral director with a sick sense of humor, attached four legs to the bottom, placed a tiny crocheted doily and flower vase on top, and positioned it neatly as a side table by the couch. The upside: the smell in the house had lessened. “Tadaa!” Peter said proudly, as if he’d just performed a magic trick, rather than built a coffee-table-coffin. “What *is* that?!” Anna asked, hoping Peter was joking. “We didn’t have a coffee table yet, right?” Peter responded. That question stunned Anna. “...Right(?)... Is she inside it? In that... coffee table(?)” Anna pulled herself together. “Yep!!” Peter replied cheerfully, oblivious to how bizarre this was.

Anna wanted the late Grandma Groundsquirrel out of the house as soon as possible—she couldn’t imagine her presence was helping Peter’s grieving process—but she also wanted to be respectful of her Groundsquirrel partner, who was clearly far deeper in mourning than she had realized. “Would you maybe... not... Why?” “I just don’t think I’m ready to let Grandma Groundsquirrel go yet. Seeing her sitting there in the wardrobe made everything feel so final. Like I’ll never speak to her again, never just drop by on a random Thursday afternoon, never get a Christmas card, never sit and read illegally downloaded biographies of Lee Harvey Oswald together. I just want to keep her close a little longer.”

Anna sort of understood where Peter was coming from, but didn’t understand why he couldn’t just use a stone or a little urn or something. Still, she was glad he was finally talking about his grief—a subject he’d been completely silent on since Grandma Groundsquirrel had kicked the bucket. “Let me know when you’ve... processed this,” she said, pointing to the coffin. “I’m going to bed.”

In the weeks that followed, the coffee-table-coffin bore a rotating lineup of decorations—one day a flower vase, a picture frame, a teapot, three-day-old breakfast, a tablecloth; the next day just some candles. Anna refused to believe Peter’s therapist thought this was a good idea, but given that the only death she had experienced in her life (apart from that basketball game incident) was her great-great-grandma Groundsquirrel dying when she was just three months old, she concluded that grief must be more complicated than she’d thought.





That night, Anna was woken up in the middle of the night by knocking at the door. Outside, the wind howled against the little cabin. Anna looked at the clock, three o'clock. She slowly made her way to the front door. The knocking, unsurprisingly, grew louder.

The first thing she noticed upon entering the living room was that the already strange stench in the cabin had intensified slightly. KNOCK KNOCK. It sounded like someone was scratching at the front door. Anna glanced at the axe Peter had placed beside the coffin, which also doubled as a coffee table. She considered picking it up in case it was some kind of psychopath, or perhaps an strangely polite burglar, but ultimately decided not to. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Anna reached the door. She opened it and cautiously greeted the blizzard outside. She looked from left to right. Nothing but darkness surrounding their front porch.

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Anna slammed the door shut behind her. The sound was coming from inside the living room. Anna turned to look at the final resting place of the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, may she rest in peace, which was still functioning as a coffee table. She took a step back. It couldn’t be…

The body of the twice-late Grandma Groundsquirrel burst screaming through the tablecloth and stepped toward her on her undead, rotting Groundsquirrel paws. Anna screamed for help. Zombie Grandma Groundsquirrel was now about a meter away from her, between Anna and the wall. Anna grabbed *If I did it* by star NFL player O.J. Simpson and flung it at her no-longer-deceased mother-in-law.

Grandma Groundsquirrel barely reacted to the controversial non coffesion and continued onwards with her slow, screaming approach. With each step, she left little bits and pieces of rotting flesh on the floor. Anna kept throwing the other 23 copies of *If I did it*, and although they left dents and imprints on the creature’s decaying skin, the attacks proved useless.

Grandma Groundsquirrel raised her decomposed paw, now more bone than skin, and grabbed Anna by the throat. Zombie Grandma Groundsquirrel opened her mouth, which turned out to be the source of that elderly Groundsquirrel stench, and showed her teeth, ready to bite.

Grandma Groundsquirrel screeched. Peter swung the axe down, splitting the head of the late Grandma Groundsquirrel, may she rest in piece, in two. It now hung loosely from her neck, attached only by the bits his axe hadn’t reached. “Die!” Peter shouted.

The now-truly-lifeless corpse of the twice-late Grandma Groundsquirrel, may she rest in piece, collapsed to the floor. Peter made a half-hearted attempt to act cool, despite having just re-killed his reanimated grandmother. Anna hugged him. Outside, the sun had slowly begun to rise. The snowstorm still howled outside. Anna made eye contact with Peter. “What now?” he asked.

Anna tried to come up with a suitable answer to that question, and to the horrifying pandemonium that had just played out in front of her. 







Then, the clocks on the walls all stopped ticking. The temperature inside dropped and without a creak or a sound, the door flew open.

A figure entered. A keen observer would notice that their feet don’t quite touch the floor. Though the snowstorm outside appears to have stopped, snowflakes still fly in behind him, settling quietly on the floor.

The figure walks over to the remains of the late Grandma Groundsquirrel and, one by one, closes her eyes. Then the figure pickes her corpse up and slings it over their shoulder. And just as suddenly as it had appeared, it exited the apartment and disappeared into the void.

The clocks starts ticking again. The storm had faded. It was a very uneventful Sunday morning.",1,1748032136.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

*A dark myth of feral love, motherhood, and ancient hunger*
**By: Rowan Graves**

It all started shortly after my son’s third birthday.

He was a babbling star—bright, impossible not to love. He’d make up silly dances and say goofy things. Once he told me the moon was “better in two pieces.” Another time, he said star-dogs visited him in his dreams. He always made me smile. I laughed.  
Maybe I should’ve listened.

It was him and me against the world. The baby was a surprise—but never unwanted. A drunken, wild one-night stand with a gorgeous man, and nine months later came this screaming ball of love.

Blonde hair. Blue eyes.  
Nothing like me at all—genetics, right?  
Carried him, birthed him—and came out looking like a stranger.

And I would give him the world if I could.  
I’d burn it down, too, if he asked.

He talked early. Crawled early.  
Just… knew things, without needing to be taught.  
My little darling was a dream come true—  
The perfect child.

**Or so it seemed.**

He turned three.  
Something changed.  
He became something else—  
**Chaos.**

I thought at first it was normal toddler behavior. You know the typical: tantrums, independence, boundary pushing, exploring his sense of self.  
‘Threenager’ drama.

Then it became—something else. I thought I was going mad. Things would move in the house. I would look for a book, or a brush, and it would be in a different room.

Or my keys would be in the freezer instead of on the hook.  
But only stuff at home was moving, so maybe I was sleepwalking?

The air would feel heavy sometimes. Like the walls were listening. I started to notice whispers.  
Not real words, not at first. Just the hum of something almost being said.

I once found him crouched in the hallway before we left for the day, facing the corner, whispering to the crack in the wall.

“What are you doing?” I asked, expecting something silly.  

“Listening,” he whispered.  

“To what?”

I waited for a story about fairies or star-dogs.  
But he just smiled—**too wide**—and didn’t answer.

I told myself, *toddlers are weird*. It didn’t mean anything.

At work, everything seemed normal. I was focused. Sharp. Climbing the tech ladder—coding my way into a leadership position in the AI department.

So I figured it was just fatigue. Single mom exhaustion. Misplacing things at home, letting stress creep in.

But then the school started calling.

First it was the drawings—dark, disturbing things no three-year-old should understand. Twisted limbs. Sharp teeth. Eyes that bled.  
One showed me—only it wasn’t me. I was dressed in a black gown, a crown of antlers sat on my head. Behind me was a black shape—maybe a castle. And a giant dog with red drips from its fangs and yellow-gold eyes.  
He titled it: *“Mommy and Gar.”*

Then came the stories. Tales he told other children that made them cry.  
Shadowy forests. Something watching. A voice beneath the bed.  
He had apparently made up a story about an apocalyptic fire—lots of kids went home very upset. Parents too.

And then—**playtime turned ritual.**

He had the whole class ‘sacrifice’ their stuffed animals to him. Said he was the “Great Wolf King” and they had to feed the toys to his mouth *“before the moon cracked.”*

His teachers were concerned. Of course they were.

“What is he watching at home?”  
“Is he left alone often?”  
“Has he been exposed to anything… disturbing?”  

Then the hard questions:  

“Does he see his father?”  
“Is Dad around?”

I bit my tongue so hard I swore I could taste blood.

Because what could I say?

That his father was a beautiful stranger from a forgotten night, a name I barely remembered?  
That I hadn’t seen or heard from him since?

That no, my toddler wasn’t watching horror films or playing violent games—but somehow, still, he was drawing bleeding eyes and whispering about cracked moons and sacrifices?

I tried to talk to him, and his answers were riddles I didn’t understand. Half-dreams whispered in the darkness, formed into starlight.  
I was lost. None of the parenting books or sites mentioned this.

I called a professional—a child psychologist. The sessions seemed to help.  
I told myself maybe he was feeling something… about not having a dad.  
He was at that age—starting to notice the gaps.

I still couldn’t understand what had triggered it all, but at least he’d stopped drawing those pictures.  
Stopped the sacrifices.  
At school, anyway.

Things began to feel normal again.  
I rejoiced in the expected toddler behaviors.  
Tantrums. Whining. Endless “why” questions.

Then one night, I heard a crash outside his window.

I ran in, heart in my throat—  
But he was fast asleep.  
Curled up peacefully, clutching his favorite wolf plushie.  
He looked so innocent.

I told myself it was a dream.  
That I’d imagined the sound.

But then came the **voices**.

Not his.  
**Others.**

Whispering. Arguing. Rising in waves like a distant crowd.

At first, I thought it was the neighbors.  
But when I stepped out into the yard, the air was still.  
Silent.  
No lights. No people. No wind.

Just the moon and stars, hanging over the lawn like a million blinking eyes.  
It felt like they were watching—**waiting**.

My sleep began to suffer.  
I stayed up entire nights.  
Waiting. Listening.

The voices returned every few days—always between 2 and 3 a.m.  
Sometimes clearer, sometimes just a murmur.

Once, I heard someone say my name—**Helena**.  
Not whispered.  
Spoken.  
Calm. Certain. Male.

The voice curled into my mind—warm and inviting, like autumn fire.  
It tickled something deep in my brain. A voice I hadn’t heard since the night we made my son. A man I hadn’t thought of in years.  
A stranger too perfect to be real—red hair, golden eyes, a body like a myth.

Could it have been… him?

I never knew who he was. And if I’m being honest—I never really looked.  
He vanished with the sunrise, leaving only a hangover and a second heartbeat in my belly.  
I had convinced myself he wasn’t real—just a fever dream of whiskey and want.  
But now…

Now I wasn’t so sure.

Because that voice had **weight**. It clung to the curtains. Sank into the floorboards. It seeded dread in my heart—what if he wanted to take away my son?

I started to notice things again.

His toys—arranged in circles, always facing the window, like they were on guard.  
Salt spilled across the threshold of his door.  
A black feather tucked into the crack of the window frame.  
Mud and stick people holding swords made of toothpicks.

I confronted him one evening, trembling with coffee and exhaustion. It had been months since I slept the whole night.

“Why do you do that with your toys?” I asked.

He didn’t answer at first. Just kept coloring—dragging a black crayon in slow, spiraling loops around a sun that had been split down the center. A jagged line through its core.

“To keep the others out,” he said finally.

I swallowed.  
“What others?”

He looked up then. His eyes were so blue, but something had changed. I didn’t notice before now—there were **golden flecks** shimmering like some kind of ancient magic.  
Sadness.  
Fear.  
Resignation.

His voice was barely a whisper.

“The ones that want to lock me away.”

I didn’t know what to say to that.

How do you respond when your **three-year-old** speaks like a prisoner of war?

I reached for his hand, and he flinched. Not like a child afraid of punishment, but like someone bracing for a vision.

“No one’s going to lock you away,” I whispered. “You’re safe, baby.”

He didn’t respond. Just started coloring again. Now the sun was bleeding.  
Drips of red falling into the spirals.

“They will,” he said, voice flat.

**It wasn’t a question. It was a statement.**

We ran that night. No one was taking my child away. I took him across states, all the way to Canada. We would hide, start over. No one would touch him.

But no matter how hard I ran.  
How much I tried to change us. Hide us—  
The voices followed.  
Close.  
Angrier.  
More urgent.

His answers never changed.  
They were coming to lock him away.

Finally, exhausted from resetting our lives every few months for the last couple years, I sat down and asked my almost five-year-old the question that plagued me.

“Why, baby?” I took his little hand in mine. “Why do you think someone is coming to lock you away?”

He had been reading. He put his book down.  
Raised his face, eyes meeting mine.  
There was no more blue in them.  
Only molten **gold**.  
**When did that happen?**

They simmered in the red-orange dusk—**excited**.  
His smile widened, and I could see his **incisors sharpen**.

“Because, Mommy,” he said, voice too deep.  
**Growling.**  
**Ancient.**

“I’m going to eat it all.”

I couldn’t breathe.

I stepped back.  
The look in my son’s eyes chilled me to the core.  
**Feral.**  
**Starving.**

“Eat it all?” I shivered, fear prickling along my spine.  
“Eat what, Fenrir?”

He stood and slowly walked to the window. The full silver moon hung low in the sky. His laugh splintered the world around us.  
The window cracked.  
The cupboards burst.  
The floor groaned like it couldn’t hold him anymore.

When he finally turned back to me, his golden eyes were glowing.  
The air around him rippled—heat waves off a summer pavement.  
His smile showed too many teeth.  
**Too sharp.**  
He laughed again—  
**The night sky shifted.**

I heard it, outside—panic, terror. Screaming. Alarms.  
Discordant chaos ringing through the still night.

His voice seethed.  
It felt like frost and fire wrapping around my heart.

I reached for my phone—to call who, I don’t know.  
My fingers never touched the case.  
My legs gave out.  
I fell to my knees, and all I heard was:

**“The world, Mommy.”**  
He grinned, hungry.

2. What is the reasonable price for two people (a separate room, preferably with a hot shower)?
3. How much should I expect to pay for the food?
4. Is it worth having a tent? We are experienced hikers, so the tent is not a problem, but it's an extra weight, and I will need to book checked baggage for my flight instead of just having a carry-on, so I would like to avoid it.
5. I am thinking about taking a small twig stove to make coffee in the mornings :) Will I be able to find a few handfuls of dry twigs along the path?

I’ve seen a lot of Chocolate Labs around that remind me of her daily but the owners always look busy or rushed, so I don’t want to stop them or share that I lost mine recently and break down in front of them (what a weird interaction that would be!).

I really want to pet and/or play with one (or multiple if you have more than one pup) for a bit. Coffee or any non-alcoholic drink on me. 

I’m open to any other breeds too—I just think this would be healing for me. 

I am in Lincoln Park but can travel to nearby neighborhoods to meet in a public park.

Edit: Please do not suggest going to an adoption place or shelter. I am unable to get another dog right now and meeting adoptable dogs would be heartbreaking for me because I wish I could take them all, but it’s not the right time. ",18,1748031784.0,AskChicago,15,0.88,False

Here's the elevator pitch to get a sense of what the book is about:  
  
*After an Inauguration Day assassination thrusts a recovering alcoholic into the presidency, a damning investigation and media crusade expose his personal and political collapse—triggering a quiet internal effort to remove him before it’s too late.*

The first chapter is pasted below.

\--

A gentle flurry of snow danced down upon Washington as a new chapter of American history rose with the morning sun. In the crisp air of a late January morning, people from all corners of the nation gathered on the National Mall, eagerly awaiting the inaugural ceremonies as they pondered whether this new administration would be one of stability or chaos. Senators, bureaucrats, lobbyists, and anyone in Washington who mattered—or paid enough to matter—beelined to the Capitol, their overcoats brushed with snowflakes and chilled by the morning breeze. The Secret Service kept its presence ubiquitous as it combed through buildings and shut down the streets and sidewalks bit by bit, carefully bracing for any event that would rock the nation to its core. Soon, a new president would take the reins of power at the beating heart of American democracy, and the eyes of the watching world were trained on the nation’s capital for his arrival.

In the Blair House, President-elect Tom Anderson had already been awake for three hours. Normally, he would be reclined on his visibly-used leather chair as he sipped coffee and watched the morning news. By this time, he might have already enjoyed a bagel or a plate of scrambled eggs, but he was too distracted by reflections of his past and thoughts of what was to come. As he threw on his black wool coat and stepped out of his bedroom, the President-elect’s memories turned to Wisconsin. After representing his home state in the Senate for 26 years, his life there was like a long lost dream. Fond memories of his childhood in the outskirts of Kenosha floated in his mind, though Washington made him into the man that built his reputation as a doer and won him the trust of the American people. Through months of tireless campaigning and tedious briefings to prepare him to take the reins, he rarely slept and never had much of a sense of where home was. Now, every minute that passed brought him closer to the moment that would define his entire life. The day he had been dreaming of for his entire career had finally arrived.

“We’re ready, Bob,” President-elect Anderson said, buttoning his coat as he ran down the stairs to meet his chief of staff, whose portly figure took up most of the bench on which he sat, his hands folded against his pressed gray suit and resting atop a navy blue folder with a gold presidential seal embossed in the center.

Bob’s round glasses nearly slid off his nose as he stood up as his boss came down the stairs and extended his hand to him. The President-elect’s hand was warm and wrinkled; Bob’s, by contrast, was cold and covered in moisturizer. Anderson looked at himself in the mirror across from the bench, straightening his cherry red tie and brushing tiny dandruff flakes off his shoulders. He ran his hand across his combed-over silver hair to clear his forehead of flyaways and smiled as Susan Anderson, the soon-to-be First Lady donning a gray canvas trench coat over a white dress, stepped behind him and grabbed his hand.

Folder in hand, Bob pushed his glasses back into place as he stepped in front of the door. Studying his boss, he commented, “You look nice today, sir.”

Anderson rolled his eyes. “Just walk me through the morning.”

Bob opened his folder and flipped through the pages until he came to his boss’s schedule. As he skimmed it, he explained, “The motorcade is waiting for you outside to take you to the service at St. John’s Church. Then, you’ll go to the White House for tea with President and Mrs. Whitaker, after which the motorcade will take you to the Capitol for the inauguration.”

Anderson let out an annoyed sigh. “Do I have to go to church?”

Bob pursed his lips. Electing the country’s first atheist president had been no easy feat, and it was particularly difficult getting Republicans on board with him. But conservative pundits had spent months convincing people he had a Reagan-esque appeal, and it had been easy for the campaign to ride the wave of excitement that such a sentiment produced. “Just do it for appearances,” he replied. “It’s tradition.”

Anderson groaned. He hated when Bob appealed to his preference for tradition. “Will Lester be there?”

“No, sir,” Bob replied, a sentence that dashed his boss’s hope that his pastor-turned-vice president would punctuate his attendance of a church service just as he had throughout the general election. “He’s set to give a sermon at the First Baptist Church of Washington.”

“A sermon?” Anderson roared. “Who the hell let him give a sermon?”

“The Vice President-elect can make his own scheduling commitments, sir.”

“On my goddamn inauguration day?”

“On the bright side,” Bob distracted, shrugging, “we won’t see him until we get to the Capitol.”

Anderson shook his head and sighed. “That’s what I get for making a pastor my running mate,” he lamented. “You know, it’ll be my luck that the vice presidency makes him relapse.”

“We just have to hope for the best, sir.”

“Just make sure he doesn’t fuck me over,” Anderson sharply demanded.

Bob nodded. “I’ll get in touch with him and see what I can do.”

“Threaten to shove his ass so deep into the Eisenhower Building that he’ll become an archeological wonder in a few hundred years if he so much as thinks about drinking again.”

Trying to force himself not to smile, Bob replied, “Yes, sir.”

Looking past Bob to the door that led to his future, Anderson smiled and replied, “Great. Let’s get ‘er done.”

Bob knocked on the front door, and a team of Secret Service agents opened the door and cleared a path for the couple. President-elect Anderson took his wife’s hand as he stepped outside for the first time that day, smiling as the brisk air hit his face. The couple waved to the sea of reporters that awaited their exit as they walked down the steps hand-in-hand. He tuned out the otherwise-deafening sound of shuttering cameras and shouting reporters as he looked over at the White House and grinned.

“Good morning, Brad,” Anderson said to the head of his security detail with a smile and a gentle nod.

“Good morning, sir,” Brad replied as he gestured toward the car. “Right this way.”

Tom and Susan followed Brad to one of the shiny black Cadillacs in the motorcade. He could feel the warmth of exhaust gases streaming from the back of the car as he walked toward the back door. Brad opened the door for the soon-to-be First Couple, who stepped inside the car and smiled as he nestled himself into the leather seat. The President-elect couldn’t keep his eyes off of the presidential seal mounted between the seats and smiled when the door was closed next to him.

Susan fastened her seatbelt and folded her hands in her lap. She looked at him with enamored eyes and lightly pinched his cheek. Her touch brought a smile to his face, though his stare remained locked on the presidential seal.

“Ever thought you’d be the First Lady?” he asked, slowly turning his attention to her.

Susan shook her head. “I remember being mesmerized by Jackie Kennedy as a little girl. Never did I imagine I’d walk in her shoes.”

Tom chuckled as Brad closed the car door. “You married me when I was attorney general. I thought you might’ve known what you were getting into.”

“Of course I did.” She broke out into a little chuckle and continued, “But it took a lot of convincing to get my parents on board with me marrying someone who worked for Jim Duncan.”

Tom’s stomach dropped when Susan said that name. He hadn’t given any thought to Jim Duncan—a man long lost from the Republican Party and the country he was once elected to lead—in years. As he took a deep breath, the car jolted forward as the wheels began to turn. He rubbed the bridge of his nose as he turned his head to watch the buildings go past them.

“Is everything alright, Tom?” Susan asked, placing her hand on his knee.

“Jim Duncan is dead to me.”

“Jim Duncan is the reason you’re here.”

President-elect Anderson closed his eyes. His thoughts drifted him back to all those sleepless nights of research and the countless hours spent gathering exculpatory evidence to save Jim Duncan, then the charismatic governor of Kentucky and the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, from a damning indictment on campaign finance violations. His success in the courtroom won him President Duncan’s trust and a nomination for attorney general. Throughout Duncan’s first term, Anderson went to the Department of Justice every day and regularly did what no attorney general should do: the president’s bidding. When he resigned to go back to Wisconsin and run for Senate a few years later, Duncan made no attempt to publicly hide his anger about Anderson’s departure and threw his support behind some no-name congressman. Anderson won the Republican primary by 300 votes after a recount and cruised to a general election victory that November. A heart attack killed Duncan a few years later, and the media made a spectacle out of one person being absent from the state funeral: Senator Tom Anderson.

Rolling his eyes, he admitted, “I hate that you’re right.”

Susan wagged her finger at her husband. “He made your career.”

“Yeah, and then he tried to tank it.”

“26 years in the Senate doesn’t just happen, Tom. Wisconsin loves you.” She looked at the presidential seal and ran her finger around the rim. “But forget him. You rose above him and stepped out of his shadow to make a name for yourself, and look where you are now.”

Tom Anderson nodded his head and smiled. After a career loathing the man who elevated him to the highest echelons of power, he felt something deeply satisfying about rising to the same level of political prominence as him. As the car rolled on, he thought of all the ways he could—and would—rise above his late boss’s presidency. In just four hours, the work to build a legacy of his own would begin.

As a flock of geese flew over Washington on that icy January morning, Vice President-elect Lester Greenspan stepped out of a black SUV. His foot crunched the layer of snow that covered the sidewalk as he closed the car door. He smiled as the cold humidity hit his skin. The stickiness reminded him of home in Louisiana, which he left the previous night to take on this daunting new endeavor.

Greenspan shoved his hands in his coat pocket and walked across the sidewalk. There were only a handful of reporters lined up to see him for the first time on Inauguration Day, though only a few snapped photos. None asked questions. As Greenspan approached the building, he looked up and smiled. “First Baptist Church” was engraved in the stone like scripture itself, beckoning him inside. He opened the mahogany door and stepped inside, taking a deep breath of the fresh church air.

The church was empty save for him and his wife, Julianna, who walked in behind him. Neither of them said much on the way to the church. Everything was just too surreal for them to put into words. Just three years before, the Greenspans had been a middle-class couple in a rural Louisiana town where Lester was a Baptist pastor and Julianna was an elementary school teacher. The longshot campaign that catapulted Lester to the Governor’s Office in Baton Rouge took a sledgehammer to the few plans they had for the future. Now, there they were, alone in a Baptist church more grand than the Vice President-elect had ever dreamed to preach in as they awaited their moment to skyrocket to the top of America’s power pyramid.

As they approached the front pew, Greenspan sighed as he looked around the church. The walls were lined with massive stained-glass windows, and there were maybe 30 or 40 rows of pews—many more than the 10 rows that Greenspan’s beloved church at home had. His breaths and heavy footsteps echoed throughout the building. He sat down in the front pew and shot an anxious look at Julianna as she sat down next to him.

“Would you give me a moment to pray?” Greenspan asked, rubbing her knee.

The look in her eyes was one of betrayal that she had grown used to sporting over the years. “I can’t pray with you?” she asked, her voice dripping with disappointment.

“It’s a big day,” Greenspan nonchalantly explained. “I need to speak to God in private.”

Julianna gently removed her husband’s hand from her knee and stood up, planting a kiss on his forehead as she scooted past him in the pew. He looked up at her with a faint smile and closed his eyes, listening to her footsteps echo through the church as they got quieter and quieter. When the door closed and the Vice President-elect was certain he was alone, he kneeled down and clasped his hands.

“Heavenly Father,” he prayed in a whisper, “I thank You for the burden You’ve chosen me to bear. I know I ain’t perfect, but I’ve always tried to walk in Your light. I’ve been Your humble and faithful servant all my life, and if this is Your plan for me, Lord, I won’t question it. I am Your servant, mighty and proud, so use me as Your vessel. If You mean to test me, Lord, then test me. I will not fail You. I will prove myself worthy of Your trust. Please keep me strong and guide me through these troubled waters as You have always done. If I stumble, don’t let me fall. If I fall, lift me to my feet. Thy will be done.” As he made the sign of the cross, he finished with, “In Jesus’ name, amen.”

Vice President-elect Greenspan opened his eyes and unclasped his hands. He turned around and reached underneath the pew, pulling out a brand-new Bible. He kissed the Bible and lifted himself back onto the pew, setting the Bible in his lap. The thought of becoming vice president excited him, but in the church, his mind raced. He should’ve felt peace and clarity, but instead, he was met with silence. As Greenspan would often tell his parishioners, God often hijacked his inner monologue to answer his prayers. This time, all he could hear were his pounding heartbeats. Greenspan gripped the Bible even tighter. If only he could find God’s familiar comfort in that empty church before his life changed forever in front of the entire world.",0,1748031728.0,DestructiveReaders,1,0.5,False

1kttj1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Turbulent_Piccolo651/comments/1kttj1v/what_is_the_drink_which_reduces_weight/,What is the drink which reduces weight?,"There is no miracle cure for losing weight you cannot soften fat overnight. However some drinks can aid in achieving your weight loss objectives in a healthy natural way. Warm lemon water is one of the few and most frequently mentioned beverages. 

Beginning the day with a pitcher of hot water combined with bubbly lemon juice may seem like too simple a start but it certainly has some clear benefits. Lemon water can first help hydrate you and stimulate your digestive system to start moving in the morning. Additionally it can aid in detoxification and hydration. Sometimes dehydration makes us feel hungry so drinking lemon water can help you avoid unnecessary nibbling. 

Lemon - also contains a trace amount of vitamin C 

which boosts your immune system and may improve your metabolism. Furthermore the lemon is more readily absorbed by your body because of the warm water. Regular intake especially before meals will make you feel satiated and naturally reduce your appetite without you giving it a second thought rather than burning fats on its own. 

Green tea - is yet another well liked beverage that helps people lose weight. This one has undergone extensive research and its benefits are supported by sound science. Green tea is packed with antioxidants especially one called EGCG that has been shown to aid in fat burning particularly when combined with exercise. Additionally it contains a modest quantity of caffeine which can help boost your metabolism and give you a little energy boost without giving you the jitters that a strong espresso may. 

Drinking green tea throughout the day has been shown to help curb hunger and keep cravings under control for many people. Just make sure to keep it simple and avoid adding too much cream or sugar to get the maximum benefit. 

Black espresso - can also aid in weight loss if consumed properly even if you don't prefer novice tea. Espresso contains caffeine which can help speed up your metabolism and increase your alertness while exercising. However it's important to remember that those elaborate espresso liquids loaded with sugar and syrup might actually have the opposite effect and cause you to gain weight. 

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) - is another beverage that has gained popularity in the weight loss community. Some people claim that drinking a tablespoon of ACV diluted in a pitcher of water before meals helps lower blood sugar levels curb appetite somewhat and aid digestion. However a word of caution never consume it undiluted as it is very acidic and can harm your teeth or stomach lining. Always dilute it in plenty of water. 

Furthermore sooner or later allow's no longer ignore the most underrated and potent beverage of all plain water. Maintaining an adequate daily intake of water might help lessen bloating keep your metabolism functioning properly and allow your body to function smoothly. You may find yourself eating less if you drink a tumbler of water before meals since it will make you feel fuller. It's such a straightforward practice yet it truly makes a difference. 

To summarize - none of those beverages will cause you to lose 10 pounds in a single day but they can aid in your weight reduction efforts if combined with a balanced diet regular exercise and adequate sleep. Consider plain water diluted apple cider vinegar lemon water green tea and (moderately) black coffee. Think of them as minor aids on your journey rather than rapid fixes as they are everyday habits that build up over time.

Layoffs. AI panic. Recession whispers. Feels like you’re stepping onto a battlefield with a spoon. But let me tell you something from someone who’s been in the trenches for 7+ years—startups, big corps, pivots, layoffs, wins, flops—you name it.

1. The market is always weird.
There’s never a “perfect time” to start your career. 2016? Slow hiring. 2020? Pandemic chaos. 2023? AI panic. The rules keep changing. Your job isn’t to find a perfect market—it’s to learn how to adapt no matter what.

2. Use AI, but don’t lean on it.
AI can boost you, faster prototyping, better research, even debugging help. But don’t skip learning just because a bot can autocomplete. Tools evolve. Strong engineers adapt.

3. Be boringly consistent.
It’s not glamorous advice, but showing up, learning daily, finishing what you start. IMO that’s what compounds. Flash fades. Grit stays. Skillset still beats noise. 

4. Don’t romanticize corporate or startup life.
Both have red flags. Both have potential. What matters is: Are you learning? Are you solving real problems? Are you surrounded by people smarter than you?

5. Connections matter.
The “hidden job market” is real. LinkedIn might feel cringe, but if you’re not visible, you’re invisible. Don’t be shy to DM people. Ask for coffee chats. Most folks are nicer than you think.

6. You’re not behind.
Everyone’s figuring it out. Stop measuring your self-worth by LinkedIn announcements. Your path is yours. Keep your eyes on it.

And finally: your first job won’t define you, but your habits will.

Keep building. Keep shipping. Keep your ego in check.

We need more doers and fewer doomscrollers.

You’ve got time. Just start moving.

# From Coast to Coast to Coast

Canada, a beautiful country with a nebulous identity. Some forty-one million people try to answer the question of what it means to be Canadian. There is little common ground between the wheat farmer just north of Moose Jaw and the painter in Mile End. Yet they call themselves the same name, love the same coffee in the morning, and taste an air they'd both call uniquely Canadian. A comfortable status quo is waning, and little stands in its way. The dream is crumbling, and the country scrambles to find what might be left behind in its wake. No matter what it is, it will be faced together; unity, nevertheless, is as transient as the short first spring, cut short by the second snowfall of the year.

In the midst of this quotidian life on the precipice, whispers of a conspiracy drift from locale to locale, the tiniest dredges of substance keeping them afloat. A murder suspect here, a robber there, whispering about a renewal, about *something*. Second-, third-hand reports all contradicting one another. Some say there is a new world coming. Some say that this one will grow stronger. Some say something else, and others spin yet another story. Few are talking about it, but those who are call it everything under the sun. There's a school of thought to dismiss it all, insofar as any school exists in the first place, ridiculous nonsense some might call it. But others aren't so quick to dismiss it. With the world being pulled tauter yet by the day, there are few things that can be entirely dismissed. Even little conspiracies about murders and kidnappings, whispers of something to come. Even those have their place in the conversation.

Perhaps to simply appease these sorts in the bureaucratic chain of survival, perhaps to reassign some busybodies causing some trouble, an official investigation has been opened very quietly. Task Force 728-KH-4, a body tentatively under the oversight of the RCMP, has been charged with investigating a possible linkage between some disparate violent crimes in Canada by some movement surrounding this 'renewal'. With very little funding and even less oversight, it is not a respected body, something reflected in its skeleton crew. Composed of civilian, law enforcement, and a few unlucky military personnel, what it lacks in organisation it fails to make up for in quite literally anything else. Nobody in their right mind wants to be assigned to it. Few even know it exists. A blip in the organisational radar, cared for by nobody.

You are one of the few members of its field group component. Tasked with taking the investigation out there to the country, you are looking for proverbial needles in a pile of haystacks. Or, more accurately, whispers of what is probably nothing in the midst of an entire country. Chasing ideatic ghosts, as it were. At least the pay and benefits are decent for the civilians, and there are far more stressful assignments out there for the rest. Nevertheless, it's no secret it's the dead end for anyone's career. Still, here you are, investigating.

After all, who knows what you might find?

Thank you for reading the chronicle introduction above! What follows is OOC information about the chronicle. Please give it a read!

This is a H:tR 5e chronicle (not set in the WoD universe) that will be playing on **Sunday evenings**. This is going to be a very roleplay-heavy chronicle focusing on character and dialogue for the most part, though there may be combat depending on how the group chooses to approach different situations! It is a very player-driven chronicle, so the direction of the story will change drastically depending on your choices. Thank you for your interest in the chronicle and reading this far! To speak a little more on what this chronicle is about, it's a celebration of Canada and what it means to be Canadian, exploring the country in all its beautiful provinces and territories. It's a long-form mystery-thriller with a political slant and noir themes, so if that's up your alley, then we're in business!

In-character is in-character and out-of-character are out-of-character, but I believe this is very important to say: **there will be NO space for bigoted players at the table**. While characters may hold their own prejudices, this should never, ever be taken into the out-of-character space. Furthermore, the in-character space should not be used as a veil for bigotry either. While bigotry and bigoted characters are topics that will be explored, simply using the in-character space to direct prejudice towards another player will NOT be tolerated. I have seen this happen before, it is a no tolerance matter at my tables. Players will be removed if this occurs. That is a promise.

As this is a queer-friendly space, please respect all identities. If that is going to be an issue, do not apply for this campaign. Similarly, this is a Jewish friendly space (I myself am Jewish), so if you have problems with Jews, do not apply for this campaign. But if you're down for a queer-friendly and Jewish-friendly space, then I'm ready to rock and roll and have a good time roleplaying with you!

1kttgdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/punk/comments/1kttgdh/some_passages_from_get_in_the_van_by_henry/,"Some passages from ""Get In the Van"" by Henry Rollins that I typed up.","""Music has mellowed out to the point to where most of it doesn't interest me anymore. I'm not a snob either. I just can't forget what I know.""

""I learned that you can get away with a lot of shit if you just do it like it's all you knew how to do.""

""Dez had put all the local bums outside on the guest list"".

""The Exploited fans are probably the most thickheaded, moronic, capable of kicking the shit out of you bunch I have ever encountered.""

""I borrowed the [really long mic] cord and did some songs out on the street. It was fun. I sang Jealous Again to a group of bums hanging out front. These guys liked me because before the gig I pulled a green tree frog off a window of the front of the club and ate it. They flipped . 'He ate a frog!'""

""It's easy to talk too much and make a fool out of yourself.""

""You spill your guts out. People just laugh at you and try to find ways to make you look stupid. It works.""

""We played the Lowenbrau Keller, a huge beer hall ... Before we went on, people were telling us about how Hitler had spoken on the stage here many years ago.""

""Dez had some fun with one of the punkers. He put a ZZ Top tape into the community blaster ... Dez told them that the tape was the new Exploited album. The punkers were stupid, they all believed him. One guy started crying, no shit.""

""Next time a guy fucks with Greg, I should just let him punch Greg's lights out. Sure would be better than having Greg call me a macho asshole. If that guy slugged Greg instead of me getting him away from his face, he might have seen it a bit differently. That's not the part he sees. He just sees me hitting some guy. He doesn't see the part where it would have been him getting his fucking lights punched out. I don't bother talking to him about it because you can't talk to Grog. You just take it and keep playing.""

""The journal is a good way to keep things to yourself. It's good to help me cut down on talking. The last thing I want to do is talk too much. I always hate myself when I do that.""

""Played last night in Vancouver, Canada. Not bad for once I usually hate that place. Some of the shittiest people known to man ... They get pissed off when you laugh at them for being the fat fucked up pieces of shit they truly are. But last night it was not as bad as it has been before. Maybe the shit heads have been off heroin for half an hour and have seen the light.""

""Played a party in Lawndale. That was a lot of fun. A bunch of stoners hanging out while we jammed. We had a great time. I like those kinds of gigs.""

""Nick [Cave] went up to one woman and put his index fingers and thumbs together so they looked like a triangle ... He told her the reason that he had his fingers like this was because he was the only director in the world to use triangular film. She asked where he was from. He replied, 'Nazi Germany'. She just stared and walked away to a group of people and pointed at us from afar.""

""Canada is a funny place. They tell you how fucked up your country is and that all you want to do is be like them and then you see their cheesy imitation bands and all you can do is laugh and get into it.""

""The Canada dates went ok. The last one had some great fights. These cheeseheads beating the shit out of each other.""

""The woman at the cash register asked if we were campers ... I told her we were avant garde terrorists roaming the Midwest wiping out stupidity with the use of flame-throwers. I told her that we were on our way to Kalamazoo and many would die.""

""Dukowski taught me something that night I will never forget ... I was complaining about the lack of people there. He totally laid into me. He said that there might only be a couple of people there but they came to see you and it's not their fault that no one else came and that you should play your guts out""

""Lots of stupid punkers at the show. I told them that Jello was a narc, a government-paid agent. That bummed their lives real bad.""

""This guy come to the door, trying to get votes for his contest ... this guy is explaining himself to Ms. Ginn. Ms. Ginn has infinite patience and politeness. I don't. I was in the kitchen making some coffee, watching this guy trying to come in and talk. I grabbed a steak knife, made stabbing motions at his face and said, ""Die, die, die!"" Ms. Ginn tried to make light of it by saying I was an actor ... I told him that if he won and didn't let me in on the money, I was going to cut him up ... She bummed at first but after a while she thought it was funny. Ms. Ginn is awesome.""

""I checked out a place where a woman had shot herself in the head a day earlier. I had my hands covered with brain, tissue, slime, dirt and dead grass ... I remember pulling the brains to my nose to see what they smelled like ... I thought about tasting it. I did not. I should have. I still have some of that lady's brains wrapped up in tinfoil. I should break off some and eat it. That will probably be my only chance to eat some human flesh.""

""Your god is a mushroom cloud. The Church of the Nuclear Christ ... That would be real cool to see you praying to an ICBM missile ... kneeling to a perfect, gleaming warhead ... Forget the second coming. You give me the missiles and I'll melt heaven.""

""I'd like to have a string of ears around my neck. Ears I cut off the policemen and policewomen that I killed. Policemen should put little skulls on the side of their car for every person they've shot. Just to shake things up a bit.""

""I laugh at dead cops. I hope how their families understand that dady or mommy was a pig and was asking for it ... I hope some cop gets shot tonight. Fuck that, even better I hope a cop's kid gets abducted, raped, dismembered, and UPS'd back to his house.""


""Thinking about the hallway, pulling me towards the bathroom. The bathroom is where the suicide lives.""

""I like traveling on boats a lot. They make me feel like I'm really traveling. I would like to do more traveling by boat.""

""There's nothing wrong with Seattle. I think the people at our shows here are real cool ... I like Seattle. I like playing there with Black Flag, always a good show.""

""Greg does not like me much. At least he told me. I can respect that ... I respec Greg more than anyone I know. He's incredible. All of us in the crew are constantly amazed by his playing and his presence. He's totally non-stop. He makes me and Dukowski look like bums, no shit ... I watched Greg play bass for almost five hours straight the other day. C'el doesn't even look at a bass until it's time to play and it shows too. It embarrasses me sometimes ... C'el is a fucking cool guy but I don't know if he's cutting it.""

""If we were in the jungle, they would be in the pot and I'd be stirring""

""Keep your blood clean, your body lean and your mind sharp.""

""The sheer genius of Ginn-Dukowski music was apparent then and fairly blinding with added time.""",3,1748031448.0,punk,2,0.64,False
