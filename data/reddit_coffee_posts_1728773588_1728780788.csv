1g2e5d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1g2e5d4/machine_advice_under_600_usdor_less/,Machine advice under $600 USD(or less),"Need some advice on purchasing either a semi or super auto machine. A few years back I had a Nespresso Vertuo of which I quickly got tired of the cost vs taste. I like espresso drinks maybe a few times a week and some on the weekend and am tired of paying $5-6 at a Starbucks or local coffee shop. I don’t mind learning a bit of technique to use a semi auto, but a super auto is curious because I want fewer steps for at least a Starbucks level cup of coffee. I want a setup for lattes, americanos, cappuccinos primarily. 

Now that the background is out of the way, my question to this forum with my use case is this: will a super auto taste such as a $400 refurb Gaggia Cardona make a good enough espresso to meet my needs? Also does a super auto make as good or better coffee than something like a separate grinder, and breville bambino? 

Finally, the Ninja Lux Cafe did come out but the US version doesn’t donAmericano and that’s a deal breaker for me. But I think I’m leaning more towards one of the refurb Gaggia machines on Whole Latte Love, for ease of use. I want as few steps to get a good cup of coffee in that price, but don’t mind learning a bit if a semi auto is THAT much better. Thoughts??",1,1728780589.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

I’m a 30 yearold entrepreneur from Tanzania, East Africa. I’ve been roasting Kilimanjaro coffee beans in the traditional way using firewood, and my business has been doing well locally. I sell my coffee to households, coffee vendors, and a few upscale coffee shops in Dar es Salaam. Kilimanjaro coffee is very popular, but less of it gets exported.

With tourism booming in Tanzania, I want to market my fresh roasted coffee directly to tourists who come to visit. My idea is to roast coffee based on orders and deliver it anywhere in the country whether to hotels, tourist destinations, or even to the airport when they are heading back home. I believe this will be a great way for tourists to take a piece of Tanzania with them.

I’m planning to create a website for this, but I’m a bit stuck. I would really appreciate any advice on how to scale up, especially from those who understand the challenges of working in third-world countries. Our coffee is the best, and I want to share it with the world!

I started looking into the church seriously, possibly at 14, more likely at 15. At 16 I was mentally out, and made sure the leaders knew it,  but I kept attending with my parents until 18 as they insisted.

They think I left because I was treated badly, which I was, but the reason I actually left was a faith crisis - or more accurately, and I'm not sure where I heard this expression, I became aware the church had a truth crisis. They believe the church is true so there can be no well thought out faith/truth crisis.

Now, I'm gradually transitioning to Exmo me, but every change that ""the bretheren"" wouldn't approve of is being seen as an act of rebellion, a fuck you to to the church and by extension to them; whether it is coffee, two piece swimwear, spaghetti straps, a pierced nose or whatever.

We've been together for 3 years now. Again he's a 34 years old male, I am a 26 year old female.

We have been living together for 2 years. For almost the entire time we've been living together we've had the same arguments, one of them being, him cleaning up after himself. I have asked, yelled, and cried for him to pick up after himself and help me with some of the cleaning in our apartment. By that I mean pick up his clothes and put them in the hamper. Throw his dirty qtips in the trash instead of leaving them on the coffee table. If I cook a meal and ask him to do the dishes to actually do the dishes and all of them. I have never asked him to deep clean anything. Just normal everyday small task to help me and keep the apartment tidy. He keeps up with it for a day or two and it's right back to be cleaning up after him and pretty much being the only one doing any cleaning.

This week though has sent me over the edge.
Thursday I cooked us dinner. I cleaned as I went and there was just the bowls we ate out of and the pan of food. I was tired and asked if he could just finish what's left of dishes. I went to bed and woke up the next morning to a pan ""soaking"" in the sink, food on the stove and dirty dishes on the stove. Saturday I cook us breakfast and then had plans to go visit my mom. He had plans to stay home and watch baseball so again I ask if he can do the dishes so I can get ready and leave. I come home again to dirty dishes and this time get told ""he did not see them"" and ""I at least did everything in the sink"" I broke down. 

I did cry “over dirty dishes"" but really it's because I have no help even when I have asked. I can't keep cleaning up after an adult. I want to leave. So AlTA for wanting to leave my boyfriend over dishes. ",1,1728780229.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

It’s been a nice pastime day-to-day, so whether it’s real or just fiction, I will carry on with the reviews. Hope you like them.

Analysis of Chapter 2
In the first part of the text, the writer makes it clear that these events occurred quite some time ago. She brings up the topic of Dua’s secrets in her posts again. I’m not enough of a Dua Lipa fan to know if this is real or not. The tone in this chapter is entirely different from the others; it feels like, from this point on, the book starts to get serious, which makes sense given the storyline. It also suggests that the previous chapters were full of enigmas—I couldn’t find any, though. Perhaps it’s just the context of the book itself. It was mentioned that the enigmas would be concise, so from what I understand, they will be simpler.

What does she mean by “the coffee is the most important part of this story”? Maybe the real story revolves around something that happened in a café? I don’t know. Once again, if this story were real, wouldn’t someone have taken a photo of Dua at the café? But it does make sense—the best way to hide something is often to leave it in plain sight. Still, how didn’t the narrator notice that M.S. was beside her? That doesn’t add up. This whole idea of him being with Dua in London only seems plausible if this “art of being invisible” truly applies. I asked my friend at work, who’s a huge Dua Lipa fan, whether she ever disappeared from social media, and she said that she does tend to vanish now and then, sometimes for days or weeks. So at least that fact is real.

Whether it’s just fiction or not, this bit about the hamburger is incredibly cute. I feel there’s a lack of temporal synchronization, as if she’s once again merging various situations from different periods. The music descriptions do align with the story being told, at least, but it feels like a very condensed summary. When she talks about Houdini, those numbers seemed quite exaggerated to me.

In short, this chapter once again feels rushed, summarized, and deliberately confusing, but it’s better than the others. I spent a few hours thinking about possible secrets but found none. What did you think?",1,1728780203.0,secretdua_lipa,0,1.0,False

I wanna start saying that I am part of a group of 8 girls and I love every single one of them, the problem is that they are all gorgeous and I’m not saying that I’m not, I consider myself to be pretty still they are often considered to be “conventionally” attractive.

I am an (almost) 19 yo girl and I have never had a boyfriend, I know it’s not the biggest issue in the world but it’s a big deal to me, I’m not sure why but it just hasn’t happened yet. The problem is that it happens frequently for me to like a guy and for one of my friends to like him too, I personally believe that if two girls like the same guy and the guy likes one of them the other should step down and let her friend be happy but it happened twice and I am the one who had to step down every time. It hurts obviously but I really love my friends and I would do anything for them.

Last week I went to a friend’s mom birthday party and I met this guy (he is a family friend of theirs) and we really hit it off, we talked a lot and he was a genuinely good guy, he also talked with some of my other friend but I thought nothing of it.

Today I met one of those friends and she asked me nonchalantly if I liked someone, I said that I haven’t had anyone in mind, she then said that she likes someone and she thought I liked him too. Knowing who she was talking about (the guy from the party) I told her that I kinda liked him but not like like him I just think I want to know him more and maybe go out with him sometimes.
She goes on to say that she ran into him and he bought her coffee and talked for a while, she said that she really likes him and I don’t know what to do.
I mean if she really likes him and he reciprocates I am obviously going to step aside but it’s so frustrating.

Why can’t I like someone without having to stop because I love my friends?

Please give me your opinion and advice on this!

That sent me down a rabbit hole looking at their other offerings. They had several coffee bar organizers for filters and accessories, yet there’s no option for what Aiden uses (Melitta 2 and basket 8-12).

In trying to find a reasonable substitute, I ended up reading much about filters. And there weren’t many that didn’t impart an unwanted taste to the brew. But the ones that were mentioned didn’t necessarily come in the right sizes.

So this leads to my asks.

How about a filter and accessory organizer designed for Aiden?

What filters are best for not adding unwanted taste? The white filters that came with Aiden work great but they aren’t available in large quantities on the Fellow site. They’re sold in quantities of 40 cone for $7.50 or 50 basket for $8. That’s not realistic for shipping because that’s not going to qualify for free shipment. Need to buy more than $75 worth. So quantity 10 just to get them shipped for free? (I mostly do batch brew.)

I was with my GF since i was in high school; she is the most beautiful woman you have ever seen, with dark curly hair, brown light caramel skin, and a height of 5 feet seven. When we meet at schools (her family just moved from another place), we quickly became friends as we were neighbors we went home together most days, studied together and did many things together. 

We dated throughout high school, and everything was fine. After one year, I went to study abroad (at the age of 19) in a different time zone, and I suffered deep depression, and our relationship suffered. I could blame all of this on myself, but I was also barely in control of everything that was going on around me.

We had to take a break all of a sudden, we were still friends but not in a romantic way, we could check on each other once in a while but that was about it, after 4 years in my studies still had 3 to go, I went back home and to my surprise she was having a wedding, I was shocked but not surprised, I knew I couldn't expect her to wait for me but deep down I hoped for it, to my surprise she was marrying an older guy with an age gap of between 13-17 years old, it was strange for They got married, and she became a wife.

Fast forward two years, I was in my country, and we met on a cruise with her husband. I was unmarried at the time, and I was there with my cousins . We started catching up on where our lives are now, and she stated she has a kid, which she showed me pictures of, etc...

This was a 5 day cruise and our rooms were on the same floor, with seeing each other everyday we both could not handle the tension, and we ended up hooking up, one time led to a second to a third and pretty much the entire last three days of the cruise we hooked up so many times that we couldn't even count simply any chance we got, by the end we said goodbye and agreed this was a one time thing and this is our final goodbye.

After our wedding, we returned to my country, and on our flight back, I was bored and stalked my Ex on her account, where there was a family post about her son turning two, but to my surprise, he kind of looked like me, and I thought maybe I was just trying to find a way to get beck with her or it was my obsession, but I felt something wrong in me, and I counted days from the cruise and realized that it might be possible, what made me believe that this is true, i have a dark birth mark just

I went back to my country and completed my last in my university landed a good job in one of the best private hospitals, and there is where i meet my now now wife whom we just got married this summer, she is the missing half that i was missing, i know they say that you can never forget your first love but i say God gave me my wife as as a proof that is just a man's saying and he does not play according to men's rules

We landed home and went to our home, and my mom and wife are like best friends as soon as we got, they just disappeared, went on to get hair braided, shopping..., i spent most of the time with my Dad and my other uncles from the father side, and he told me that when we were children, he burned himself on that exact spot, and he showed me his big scar at the exact place I was buffed as this might be just a normal scar and he doesn't have a birth

So the next morning, I reached out to my Ex and asked her if we could meet; she hesitated because she knew I was married now and was afraid that we might fail to control ourselves just like the last time, but I assured her that she has nothing to worry about because I love my wife with all my heart and I could not even think of doing anything to betray her trust; we met at this coffee shop that she owns, we chatted a bit, and I asked her if he could be my son, and And I replied maybe to find out if I have a son I don't know about, and she said what should you do about it? She rose up and departed.

I returned home more puzzled than ever. As I drove back home, it occurred to me that because my father is the eldest of seven children, the only people who knew him prior to the scar are my grandfather and grandmother; poor me, grandfather is gone, and grandmother is so elderly and has memory issues.

I kind of let it go and tried to enjoy the vacation I was on, caught up with my old friends, met my wife's side of the family, travelled around the country, and we were having the best time of the vacation, and one we all were having lunch at my grandma because it was her 89th birthday, we went there, celebrated her birthday with all my cousins, uncles, aunties, and all their families, it was amazing.

At the end of the day everyone was leaving and me and few my cousins chose to stay for the night as this was a house closer to the beach so we can go swimming 6 am as we used to do when we were young, and in the evening i went to my grandma 's room and we were talking she was asking me how i am and how i manage leaving abroad far from the family you just motherly chats, and i asked her about my birthmark and asked her if my dad had the same before he had the scar on his leg, and if grandpa had one (i don't my grand pa he died way before i was born), and her face changed and i could see that her mood changed, i told her if this a triggering question we can just let it go, as i do not want to trigger my grand dads memory on her birthday (so i thought), she asked me why i am asking her all this questions, i told her the truth and she told me she will tell the truth but asked to swear on my life to never tell anyone even if it is my wife as long as she is a live , as i was eager to know the truth i said yes, which i kind of regret knowing the truth and hiding it all from everyone.

My grandmother asked me to open her wardrobe and asked me to bring out one of her suitcases where she kept some of her old pictures. I brought it out and she started showing some of her pictures when she was young and in her pictures there is this guy with a big afro with her, in like 2 or 3 pictures and I thought it was grand father and to my surprise she told me that he is her first boyfriend (but they couldn't be together because dating at a young age was not seen permissible)

As they got married, the other guy couldn't take it, so he chose to leave their city and go far away for good, but before he left, they had an affair that would later result in my father, but since the time he left, my grandfather and mother never saw him or heard from him again, and when my father was born, my grandmother recognized the birthmark and it was visible as my father was more like a light skin , so my grandmother burned it off as he was still young for this to be never revealed as my father's She told me that when she had all six other siblings, her grandfather died, and she never remarried, so she chose to raise all of the children alone.

At this point, I was speechless at how my grandmother had kept this secret for so long and now I have to act as if I don't know the truth. I couldn't sleep for the entire night, wondering how my grandmother felt all these years not knowing who her true love is or if he is still alive or not, or my father, who doesn't know that he probably has a father who is alive, and so many questions were running through my mind, but at least now I know that I have a son.

But I'm not sure what to do; my ex doesn't want to talk about it since she doesn't want to jeopardize her marriage; I'm not sure if I'll inform my wife about this new discovery that I am a father; should I leave this go? or do I fight to be a part of my son's life, even if it means alienating her mother? I am completely lost i have been thinking for like a year now and i haven't found the best way to approach this . WHAT SHOULD I DO?

Disclaimers:

1. My grandmother actually died a month after she told me this.
2. Tried to raise this with my dad and when i told him about his dad he told me that since he has never been in his life the dad he knows and consider us who raised him and i found no reason to say it to anyone else.
3. Didn't tell my dad whole story told him that i only knew this about this because Grandma wanted me to tell him the truth when she is no longer here.",1,1728779558.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,1.0,False

I've been following a 1500 cal diet for about 1 month now, and actually loving it! But the past couple days my hunger for food has shot to 0. Some days I have to force myself to eat, as I do not want to eat under 1000 calories. 

One or two days of irregular hunger would be fine, but I don't want this to become a trend. How can I increase my hunger? Will my hunger go back to normal? I used to struggle a bit with restrictive tenancies and do not want to fall back into that, but I'm just not very hungry it seems.

Things that I've done that could potentially be helping me feel full: High protein, I drink lots of coffee, high volume eating. I also try to eat well balanced meals and do not restrict as long as I can fit it into my cals for the day.

The only thing that I can think of is that the past few days for breakfast I've had a high protein, high volume meal that is in general lower cal w/ coffee. But in general, I try to do this every morning. Despite nothing changing however, this breakfast could keep me full for the whole day if I didn't force myself to eat later on. I'm not on any meds or under high stress. 

Thoughts on how to help with this? Thanks :)",2,1728779512.0,1500isplenty,0,1.0,False

1g2dszi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Suspicious_Box9837/comments/1g2dszi/i_discovered_that_i_have_a_twoyearold_son_from_an/,"I discovered that I have a two-year-old son from an affair with my married ex-girlfriend, and my father is also an affair son and i don't know what to do. ","  
  
I, a 28-year-old man, had an affair with my married ex-girlfriend, a 27-year-old female, which resulted in a son that I was unaware of, and discovering this information uncovered a 60-year-old secret from my family that I only recently learnt about.  
  
I was with my GF since i was in high school; she is the most beautiful woman you have ever seen, with dark curly hair, brown light caramel skin, and a height of 5 feet seven. When we meet at schools (her family just moved from another place), we quickly became friends as we were neighbors we went home together most days, studied together and did many things together.   
  
We dated throughout high school, and everything was fine. After one year, I went to study abroad (at the age of 19) in a different time zone, and I suffered deep depression, and our relationship suffered. I could blame all of this on myself, but I was also barely in control of everything that was going on around me.  
  
We had to take a break all of a sudden, we were still friends but not in a romantic way, we could check on each other once in a while but that was about it, after 4 years in my studies still had 3 to go, I went back home and to my surprise she was having a wedding, I was shocked but not surprised, I knew I couldn't expect her to wait for me but deep down I hoped for it, to my surprise she was marrying an older guy with an age gap of between 13-17 years old, it was strange for They got married, and she became a wife.  
  
Fast forward two years, I was in my country, and we met on a cruise with her husband. I was unmarried at the time, and I was there with my cousins . We started catching up on where our lives are now, and she stated she has a kid, which she showed me pictures of, etc...  
  
This was a 5 day cruise and our rooms were on the same floor, with seeing each other everyday we both could not handle the tension, and we ended up hooking up, one time led to a second to a third and pretty much the entire last three days of the cruise we hooked up so many times that we couldn't even count simply any chance we got, by the end we said goodbye and agreed this was a one time thing and this is our final goodbye.  
  
After our wedding, we returned to my country, and on our flight back, I was bored and stalked my Ex on her account, where there was a family post about her son turning two, but to my surprise, he kind of looked like me, and I thought maybe I was just trying to find a way to get beck with her or it was my obsession, but I felt something wrong in me, and I counted days from the cruise and realized that it might be possible, what made me believe that this is true, i have a dark birth mark just  
  
  
I went back to my country and completed my last in my university landed a good job in one of the best private hospitals, and there is where i meet my now now wife whom we just got married this summer, she is the missing half that i was missing, i know they say that you can never forget your first love but i say God gave me my wife as as a proof that is just a man's saying and he does not play according to men's rules  
  
We landed home and went to our home, and my mom and wife are like best friends as soon as we got, they just disappeared, went on to get hair braided, shopping..., i spent most of the time with my Dad and my other uncles from the father side, and he told me that when we were children, he burned himself on that exact spot, and he showed me his big scar at the exact place I was buffed as this might be just a normal scar and he doesn't have a birth  
  
So the next morning, I reached out to my Ex and asked her if we could meet; she hesitated because she knew I was married now and was afraid that we might fail to control ourselves just like the last time, but I assured her that she has nothing to worry about because I love my wife with all my heart and I could not even think of doing anything to betray her trust; we met at this coffee shop that she owns, we chatted a bit, and I asked her if he could be my son, and And I replied maybe to find out if I have a son I don't know about, and she said what should you do about it? She rose up and departed.  
  
  
I returned home more puzzled than ever. As I drove back home, it occurred to me that because my father is the eldest of seven children, the only people who knew him prior to the scar are my grandfather and grandmother; poor me, grandfather is gone, and grandmother is so elderly and has memory issues.  
  
  
I kind of let it go and tried to enjoy the vacation I was on, caught up with my old friends, met my wife's side of the family, travelled around the country, and we were having the best time of the vacation, and one we all were having lunch at my grandma because it was her 89th birthday, we went there, celebrated her birthday with all my cousins, uncles, aunties, and all their families, it was amazing.

  
At the end of the day everyone was leaving and me and few my cousins chose to stay for the night as this was a house closer to the beach so we can go swimming 6 am as we used to do when we were young, and in the evening i went to my grandma 's room and we were talking she was asking me how i am and how i manage leaving abroad far from the family you just motherly chats, and i asked her about my birthmark and asked her if my dad had the same before he had the scar on his leg, and if grandpa had one (i don't my grand pa he died way before i was born), and her face changed and i could see that her mood changed, i told her if this a triggering question we can just let it go, as i do not want to trigger my grand dads memory on her birthday (so i thought), she asked me why i am asking her all this questions, i told her the truth and she told me she will tell the truth but asked to swear on my life to never tell anyone even if it is my wife as long as she is a live , as i was eager to know the truth i said yes, which i kind of regret knowing the truth and hiding it all from everyone.  
  
My grandmother asked me to open her wardrobe and asked me to bring out one of her suitcases where she kept some of her old pictures. I brought it out and she started showing some of her pictures when she was young and in her pictures there is this guy with a big afro with her, in like 2 or 3 pictures and I thought it was grand father and to my surprise she told me that he is her first boyfriend (but they couldn't be together because dating at a young age was not seen permissible) 

   
As they got married, the other guy couldn't take it, so he chose to leave their city and go far away for good, but before he left, they had an affair that would later result in my father, but since the time he left, my grandfather and mother never saw him or heard from him again, and when my father was born, my grandmother recognized the birthmark and it was visible as my father was more like a light skin , so my grandmother burned it off as he was still young for this to be never revealed as my father's She told me that when she had all six other siblings, her grandfather died, and she never remarried, so she chose to raise all of the children alone.  
  
At this point, I was speechless at how my grandmother had kept this secret for so long and now I have to act as if I don't know the truth. I couldn't sleep for the entire night, wondering how my grandmother felt all these years not knowing who her true love is or if he is still alive or not, or my father, who doesn't know that he probably has a father who is alive, and so many questions were running through my mind, but at least now I know that I have a son. 



But I'm not sure what to do; my ex doesn't want to talk about it since she doesn't want to jeopardize her marriage; I'm not sure if I'll inform my wife about this new discovery that I am a father; should I leave this go? or do I fight to be a part of my son's life, even if it means alienating her mother? I am completely lost i have been thinking for like a year now and i haven't found the best way to approach this . WHAT SHOULD I DO? 

  
Disclaimers: 

1. My grandmother actually died a month after she told me this.

2. Tried to raise this with my dad and when i told him about his dad he told me that since he has never been in his life the dad he knows and consider us who raised him and i found no reason to say it to anyone else. 

3. Didn't tell my dad whole story told him that i only knew this about this because Grandma wanted me to tell him the truth when she is no longer here. ",1,1728779423.0,u_Suspicious_Box9837,0,1.0,False

1g2dsfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1g2dsfn/a_guide_to_dressing_spell_candles_while_keeping/,A Guide to Dressing Spell Candles (While Keeping Fire Safety in Mind),"Hello everyone!



It's October. Those of you who have been with us for a while might have noticed that the sub gets a LOT more traffic this time of year, especially from new seekers to the craft. 



One of the questions I've seen getting asked pretty frequently lately is *HOW DO I DRESS A SPELL CANDLE THAT WON'T BURN MY HOUSE DOWN?*



And this is a seriously great question. I love seeing practitioners both new and old adhering to good fire safety practices! 



So today I'm going to do a little tutorial on how I dress candles for spellwork, while still being cautious about fire safety. 



(For more reading, I do recommend checking out [our most recent guide on fire safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/173rfxb/lets_talk_about_fire_safety/), as well as this [helpful guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/candlemaking/comments/k9x883/regarding_putting_flowers_crystals_coffee_beans/) from r/candlemaking.)

  


**Some best practices when working with fire:**



* Always use proper candle holders, NOT random plates, jars, cups, mugs, ramekins, etc. 
* If you absolutely must use something that is not a proper candle holder, make sure you are using FIREPROOF materials only. Glass and ceramic are NOT fireproof, even if they are said to be “oven safe” or “heat safe”. Fireproof materials include things like metals and cast iron. 
* NEVER, EVER LEAVE A BURNING CANDLE UNATTENDED!
* Always trim the wick before burning a candle.
* When dressing a spell candle with herbs and oils, less is more! You're not looking to create a huge flaming torch here. A pinch of basil goes just as far, metaphysically speaking, as a whole handful.



# FOR THIS TUTORIAL, I AM USING:



* A chime candle. I like this size of candle for spells because it burns out within an hour and therefore doesn't need to be babysat for a long time.
* A mortar and pestle to crush up my herbs. Larger pieces are more likely to catch fire. 
* A plastic rolling tray.
* Ritual oil that is made from a base oil that is NOT flammable. 
* Prosperity herbs and spices.

I'm doing a simple money spell here, because prosperity work is never unwelcome. 



The first thing I always do is add a pinch of each herb or spice to my mortar. I typically choose only 1-3 ingredients to use, so as not to overdress the candle. 



Again, remember, more is not always more and will not make your spell more powerful.



https://preview.redd.it/0qzdwwh24fud1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a0940831707d38e62ce9633294766a80f6b5e1a



Once everything is crushed up as finely as I can manage, I add a couple drops of oil to my candle and use a fingertip to spread it around the whole candle. 



The candle does not need to be dripping in oil. You just need enough to make your herbs stick. 



https://preview.redd.it/r2pissb54fud1.jpg?width=3205&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ea85472ecb76a7f9f3b5ef39a25e432175cd6c6



Then I pour my crushed up herbs onto my rolling tray and roll my oiled candle through them.



A light dusting will do the job just fine. You do not need to absolutely coat the candle in herbs for it to be effective and successful.



https://preview.redd.it/dpo25wc84fud1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=59be8b7e1615329aeeeafaeeb2b957a65e2ba79f



I use chime candle holders for candle spells because they're a great size and hold the candle upright pretty well. If your candle is a bit too narrow, I recommend melting the bottom a little bit with your lighter before sticking it into your candle holder. 



If you would like to add more components to your spell, such as additional herbs, crystals, tarot cards, runes, petitions, whatever, I recommend using a metal dish or tray. 



Place your candle, in its proper holder, in the centre of your tray and add your extra ingredients around the base of the holder. This way, you can draw upon the energy of additional ingredients without risking everything catching fire.



For petitions, I always tuck them underneath the candle holder. 



https://preview.redd.it/3bbqfdsf4fud1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e46cf3f03e51a60f875645e270370e69055e85b



The last step before burning is an important one: trim your wick! The standard recommended length is ¼ inch above the wax. 



Now you're ready to do candle magick!

Feel free to drop your fire safety tips below, or to ask any questions.



A great book on getting started with candle spells is Madame Pamita's “The Book of Candle Magic”, which I highly recommend if you're looking to learn more.



Stay safe out there, everyone.

Jeremiah 29:11 is a popular verse that’s often slapped onto journals, etched into coffee mugs, and printed on t-shirts.

“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”
‭‭Jeremiah‬ ‭29:11‬ ‭NIV‬‬

And God does have a plan for you.
God does want to bless you.
God does want to give you hope and a future. 

But—we should also pay attention to the original context …

In this case, God was speaking through the prophet Jeremiah to the people of Judah—people who’d recently been exiled to Babylon for 70 years. 

The Jewish people were banished to a foreign land because of their insatiable appetite for sin. In fact, for 23 years Jeremiah had been warning them to stop rebelling against God or prepare to face the consequences.

God is patient, but He is also just. In the preceding chapters, God made a case against His beloved people:

They’d exploited foreigners, orphans, and widows. They’d denied the rights of the poor. They’d refused to stand up for truth or obey God’s instructions. They’d murdered the innocent and committed adultery. They’d rejoiced in doing evil and their lives were ruled by greed. They’d even built pagan shrines, sacrificing their sons and daughters in the fires. It was a dark time. And yet, somehow, God’s mercy always extends to the darkest places on earth.

That’s why, just a few verses later, God said they could seek Him and find Him, and He’d bring them back from captivity (Jeremiah‬ ‭29:13‬-14).

That’s why he encouraged them—while in exile—to build houses, plant gardens, get married, have children, and work for the peace and prosperity of their temporary home (Jeremiah 29:5-7).

He wanted them to know: He hadn’t forgotten them. He still wanted good for them. He still had plans to restore them.

God is serious about sin, but He’s just as passionate about redemption.

Though Jeremiah 29:11 was meant for a specific people at a specific time, God’s heart for the restoration of broken people is generationally timeless. 

Even when we feel stuck in the process, God still has a plan. 
We can put our trust in the God whose goal is always redemption.

PRAYER God, I know You have a plan for my life, and that You want to bless me. Help me lean into that promise! Sometimes it is hard to see past my present struggles. Thank You for loving me even when I have doubts and fears. Fill me with Your hope and peace. In Jesus' name, Amen

1g2dpu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/hanamaui/comments/1g2dpu5/worst_host_in_hana/,Worst host in Hana ,"Roberta!!!
The host of this AirBnb lacks scruples. While the home is in good condition, the photos are misrepresentation of solitude, as the tiny home is surrounded by her other rentals, and the nearby beach is, understandably, inhabited by natives who were displaced by the fire… and AirBnb buying out all available housings. 
My husband, child, and I were scheduled to stay at the house at 4893 Uakea Road in Hana, Hawaii from August 25th through August 27th, 2024. We were staying in another AirBnb in Kihei the previous four nights, August 21st  through the 24th. Our extended family was staying at another AirBnb in Kihei on those dates and had a similar reservation to stay at the AirBnb at 2575 RT-360 in Hana, Hawai,i 9671,3 from the 25th to 27th. 

On August 24, the tropical storm, Hone, was upgraded to a hurricane, hitting Maui, with force, on August 25. As is well-known, the road to Hana is a treacherous one in the best of circumstances, but in the middle of the eye of a hurricane, it would equate to being reckless with our lives to attempt to navigate the road, as it is prone to flash flooding, waterfalls traversing the road because of flooding, and downed trees. This is the epitome of a Major Disruptive Event under Airbnb’s policy. 

I messaged our host, Roberta, at 10:18 p.m. on August 24th, letting her know that, under the extreme weather conditions, and likely closures, as well as the advisement of every local we spoke with, we would need to cancel our reservation for the 25th, and, as long as the only road, into and out of Hana, Hana Highway, was open, we would keep our reservation for the following day, the 26th. We extended our stay at the Kihei AirBnb. Please understand that we did not want to stay any longer in Kihei, as we were excited for Hana, and the conditions at the Kihei condo were unpleasant, due to rodent droppings, a dead rodent smell, and insect issues.

Our extended family also chose safety and stayed in Kihei. They received a full refund for their first night at the Airbnb at 2575 RT-360 in Hana. Their host agreed it would be dangerous to drive to Hana during a hurricane. 

Our host, Roberta, did the opposite. She claimed that the road would be safer than usual, due to the crews caring for the road during the “inclement” weather. She actually encouraged us to traverse one of the world’s most dangerous roads while the hurricane broke over it. 

As it turns out, the road was closed due to downed trees that would’ve prevented our safe journey. I’ve attached reports. Additionally, when we traveled to Hana the next day, many stands, parks, sites, and stores remained closed due to the hurricane. At the first stop on the road to Hana, Twin Falls, we were told by a park ranger that it would’ve been foolish to drive the Hana Hwy on the 25th, as the “entire valley” of Twin Falls was closed.  

We made it to the Hana House on Uakea Road at about 4:30 p.m. on August 26th. The door was unlocked and did not necessitate a code. I texted our host to alert her that her property was unlocked. She physically showed up on the property, interrupting our attempt to settle in for our terribly brief stay. She tried to negotiate the refund, offering a free future stay. I did not want to have such a conversation - only desiring to get our family settled; I told her I would think about her offer and encouraged her to reconsider the refund. The host then appeared a second time that evening, inquiring about the status of the coffee maker and bringing us milk and butter left over from another guest. 

To summarize: Hurricane Hone prevented our family from getting to the Hana Airbnb on August 25th, 2024. The only road to Hana was dangerous and impassable at times. We kindly demanded a refund for the night of the 25th, in the amount of $889.56 and the host has zero scruples. Oh, and she ruined our one night of peace on Maui (after I had been diagnosed with cancer six days prior.)

1g2dmo8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g2dmo8,First aged build: Vintage Coca Cola sub,"
Hey guys, first time poster, long time lurker here.  I just finished up this build a couple days ago and wanted to share. I’ll try to go into as much detail as possible for the folks who want to know the process. Apologies for the long post, feel free to skip by if you don’t feel like reading. 

I was inspired by photos of those crusty Rolex 65361 models ( though I couldn’t find a decent case without crown guards ). I know a lot of this subs members aren’t a huge fan of aged builds, but I love them. I wear alot of vintage clothing, so the plan was to build something that somewhat matched with that sort of aesthetic. In regards to the coke dial, the American in me loved the idea of a branded watch. Much like the Comex, Dominos and Honda Rolex’s.

The parts: 
Every last part is from AliX, including tools used. Nh35 movement, ( the date wheel model was cheaper than the movement without the date wheel, but there was no problem putting the dial over the date wheel ), Coca-Cola seiko dial, sub hands, vintage sub case and bracelet. The case and bracelet came as a set together. The case is great but the bracelet is a little cheap feeling. My parts total was about $85 USD. Everything came in about two weeks to west coast United States. Not listing part links in description but if anyone’s interested in the AliX links I’ll be more than happy to share.

The process: 
Since this was my first aging build there was a lot of accidents and successes. I started by browning the dial in instant coffee, but I got impatient and decided to bake the dial in coffee grounds like I had seen other users do. Long story short the coffee was too close to the burner, and the whole thing caught fire. It wasn’t intended but it sucked quite a bit of saturated color out of the dial. I continued to use matte varnish and weathering powders to build up the indices with texture and color, along with rubbing some white and brown on the black parts of the dial. Same process on the hands; little bit of varnish, weathering powder till it sticks to build up a rust like patina until I was happy. I had less luck with the bezel. All the things I tried to lighten or “ghost” the bezel didn’t work, so I just decided to scuff it up with a scotch pad and some sandpaper.  The case and bracelet were aged by throwing it in a bin of rocks and nails, shaking it to give it a matted tin like color. The case back was electro etched with salt water and a 9 volt battery. Id be happy to share that process with anyone that’s interested. 

That’s about it, thanks for looking. Feel free to ask me any questions about the build, and I’ll see you guys in any future build posts!

At 36, I find it incredibly frustrating to communicate with my spouse, who is 48. It often feels like I'm either not expressing myself clearly or just pointing out everything he does wrong. I'm at my wit's end, constantly feeling ignored, and it seems that what I consider important doesn’t hold the same weight for him. 

For instance, I handle the majority of the cleaning in our home. While we both work and contribute financially, I find myself taking on most household chores. I’ll admit, I truly dislike doing laundry and unloading the dishwasher, but I’m the one who consistently cleans the floors, baseboards, windows, and the entire toilet—not just the bowl. I take care of the shower, mirrors, dusting, and changing the sheets. I’m also the only one who vacuums or shampoos the carpets.

Meanwhile, my spouse sweeps maybe twice a year, takes out the trash occasionally, and does the dishes about once a week. He used to help with laundry and cooking, but now he mainly handles just his clothes. 

Recently, after spending the morning cleaning the blinds, baseboards, and mopping, he spilled his drink and knocked everything off the coffee table, splattering beer all over the rug, walls, and windows that I had just cleaned. When I asked him to please be more careful, it felt like my concerns were dismissed. He had already spilled beer on the stairs, which I had just touched up, and while he wiped it up, he didn’t use any cleaner, leaving the area sticky. It’s disheartening, especially since his family is visiting next week, and I feel like I’m the only one putting in the effort.

I’ve repeatedly asked him to be more mindful and to clean up properly, but he seems indifferent and thinks I’m overreacting. When I express that his actions make me feel overlooked, he responds with confusion but doesn’t make an effort to understand or help clean up. Instead, he points out the few chores I don’t do, like dishes and laundry, which is true, but at least he used to help with those tasks.

It's not that I don’t care for him; I’m just growing resentful of feeling ignored and invalidated. My thoughts and feelings seem to carry little significance when they differ from his, and I know my frustration shows on my face. I just wish for a bit more understanding and cooperation.",1,1728778073.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

I got a promotion in late July- early August in a new department at my company. I’m grateful for my promotion, but since I’ve gotten promoted I’ve been unhappy for the following reasons 

1. I dislike my departments management style. Management is often super critical and doesn’t allow margin for error. Every little mistake is the end of the world. It’s caused one of our new hires to break down and cry during our close week. 
2. Along with being critical, management micromanages every little thing. I get messages on teams saying where are you when I go to the bathroom. I have to CC management for every email, which never occurred in my old department. Whenever I talk to a friend, I get the whole you owe me 2 minutes type lecture. I am only allowed to socialize when I’m at lunch and when I get coffee with friends, so I’m going hours without talking. 
3. My contract doesn’t allow for a raise until January 2026, despite the COL increasing. 

I’ve had it with it. I was planning on staying until  March but I can’t take it. I’ve taken a couple interviews and I can easily get 5K-15K more. My question is, is it too early to leave?

We both have mental health challenges and that has always been something that has caused fights that damage our relationship. They are extremely manipulative and have a lot of trouble taking accountability for hurtful actions and words. Things have been extremely unstable the past few months and they have threatened suicide numerous times, especially in connection with my desire to end the relationship, as it is no longer healthy (not that it ever was). I have made my fair share of mistakes in the relationship of course, but I have worked hard to get professional help and make positive changes in my life.

They have been having these episodes that result in berating me and getting enraged. They hurt themselves and damaged our property with a knife a few weeks ago, then blamed me for causing them to get that way. It is extremely challenging to calm them down and I seem to make the situation worse no matter what I say most times. I almost always have to take 100% of the blame to get them stabilized.

They are again threatening to unalive themselves today and I’m at my breaking point. I left the house to clear my head and get a coffee with my sibling, and now they are pissed at me for “abandoning them” while they were in need.

Anyway, wanna hear your takes on this, coz I’ve been thinking about it since episodes aired.

One phrase during Al vs Adam fight caught my attention. 
Adam: “mortal soul is no match for me” 

Alastor says “u should know better than anyone what a soul can accomplish when take charge of their own fate” 

It’s obvious he refers to lilith or eve. but how is this relevant, he is not either of them? Why does he even bring it up when Adam mentions he is no match for him?

Does Alastor imply he took charge of his own fate? it contradicts the leash theory, so I doubt that.  

Now moving with the slides: 
Alastor says, “what a soul” looks at his mic, “can accomplish when blah blah blah”. and the shadow that seems to grow from the mic travels toward Adam and hits him. 

I want u to remember what root of evil looks like in the show (last picture). SO MUCH like Alastor’s shadow during this part of their dialogue. You can even rewatch both parts of the show (where evil is explained, and this part of the battle)


Does Roo (Eve, in my theory) give powers to Alastor?
Did Alastor eat the apple and take charge of his fate?
Did I drink too much coffee? What do you think?

I am a T1D who tries to not use much insulin so I mainly only eat veggies, protein, and nuts. Food really doesn't excite me at all. I never want to go out and eat or crave something specific because what I can eat is so limited. The problems come from my zero carb vicea. Every morning I would NEED a full pot (12 cups) of black coffee for me to even function. I loved the feeling of my heart thumping and my brain in a blur. I would sometimes drink an energy drink at night if I wanted a boost after the fact. I also had an alcohol problem where each night I drank a minimum 6 oz of straight whiskey on the rocks. It was not uncommon for me to have an additional finger or two on top of that, but it was something I needed because I looked forward to it each day so much. 

On top of this all, I was the kind of person to LOVED sex. When I started dating my wife were having sex multiple times a week. I would also occasionally masterbate. When we were trying for our first kid we had sex every day for a week and it is still something I think about all the time as one of the highest points of happiness. 

After my first kid I was prescribed Wellbutrin. I had suicidal thoughts (making a plan, researching methods, checking life insurance) I knew I needed to get help. First time ever with a therapist or psychiatrist. Also quit coffee and alcohol besides the social cup of coffee or light beer with friends and family. Overall I've had my struggles (mainly from not being able to spend as much time on my hobbies like gaming and football like all my childless friends) but am in a WAY better stop compares to before. 

The problem is the sex drive. My wife is pregnant with our second child and due to medical reasons shouldn't have sex. She has also lost most her sex drive after our child. I meanwhile have an INSANE sex drive. I never knew this could be a side effect until today (a year after I started taking Wellbutrin) but it makes so much more sense. If I so much as see my wife itch her boob, it is all I can think about for the rest of the day. I masterbate 2 times minimum a day, many times more. If I even hug my wife I get extremely aroused. I've been like this for the last year and thought it my just me but never noticed it lines up with my prescription.

The proceeds are going to help rebuild farms in Toledo that were devastated by the fires this year. 

They have been sending down seedlings, seeds, pots, and whatever else these generational farms may need to rebuild and provide food for themselves, their neighbors, and communities. Some of these farms have been sent supplies and seedlings via horse and/or boat, as they are not accessible via highway or road. Others just get the supplies in a truck, if that is an option! 

This effort has been primarily spearheaded by Sue Harris, who has lived in Cayo for over a decade. People who live here would most likely know her and her husband Chris as the British couple from White Rock Farms who make and sell delicious cheese.  

There will be coffee and treats that people are donating - kind of like a dessert potluck with a charitable slant. There will be a donation box, with a suggested donation of 10 bz. 

 It is a great way to help make a difference and also get to socialize a bit, if you live in the area. 

I will be making coconut cookies and/or oatmeal with cacao nibs - I haven't decided.

1g2czx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menieres/comments/1g2czx0/fighting_meniere/,Fighting Meniere.,"I'm 30, male, not overweight, and generally in good physical condition. I was diagnosed with tinnitus, dizziness, and hearing loss in one ear last year. At first, I felt depressed and sad, but I decided to fight back. Now, I'm happy with the results—no more dizziness and very mild tinnitus.

If you're here, you're probably feeling like most people do when this starts: lost. The fact that there's no cure hits hard. So here's what I’ve learned:

1. **Fight your own mind first.** No matter your situation, you need to get your thoughts on your side. Stay positive—not because you’ll be cured (there’s no cure), but because negativity and depression won’t help and can even worsen things. I chose to be positive, even when it felt silly. If you need therapy to get your mind into a useful state, go for it. I recommend cognitive-behavioral therapy, stoicism, and reading Epictetus. You must learn that while you can’t control what happens, you can control your thoughts.
2. **Eat well and enough.** This illness seems linked to a weakened immune system. My first dizziness attack happened during a time when I wasn’t taking care of myself, losing weight due to stress. I’ve experimented with cutting out salt, sugar, fast food, coffee, alcohol, etc., with no noticeable effects. But when I skipped meals, I felt weak, and my tinnitus seemed to worsen. So, eat enough food.
3. **Stay hydrated.** Drink as much water as you need. Some advice online says to limit liquids, but I tried very little water for a month with no effect. When I switched to drinking almost 4 liters a day, I felt stronger, more energetic, and my tinnitus decreased.
4. **Exercise moderately.** I jump rope for five to ten minutes a day. It’s a great exercise that gets my heart pumping, which helps if this illness is linked to circulation issues. Avoid over-exercising though, as fatigue can make you feel weak and possibly worsen tinnitus.
5. **Get good sleep.** Try to rest well—aim for 6 to 7 hours a night. Sleep on your side or stomach, not your back, to avoid putting pressure on your neck and head.
6. **Massage your neck and the back of your head.** I do this for 5 minutes every morning and before bed, and it’s been one of the most helpful things for me. I also massage my whole head.
7. **Hot and cold baths.** I tried these for a month each, but they didn’t help.
8. **Magnesium and vitamins.** I’ve taken them, and while they haven’t made a huge difference, they might help you.
9. **Consider this treatment.** Here's a study to discuss with your doctor: [Gacek RR Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Gacek+RR&cauthor_id=25940200). I’m currently undergoing this treatment and feel better since starting it. It might work for you too.
10. **Watch your posture.** Pay special attention to the position of your neck and head.
11. **A great trick for dizziness attacks: When you feel one coming, take deep, fast breaths—like you’re suddenly restarting your breathing. It’s weird, but it works for me. Try it.**
12. **Migraines and Meniere's disease seem related.** I’ve had migraines since I was 16. When I feel a migraine starting, I take a long walk or jump rope. It doesn’t stop the attack but reduces its intensity by about half. Be careful, though—if you walk, go with someone. It’s counterintuitive since all you want to do is lie down in a dark, quiet room, but this method has worked for me. I haven’t had a migraine in 3 or 4 years. Also, don’t change your coffee intake drastically—stick to a small daily dose, like one small cup.

Since doing the above, I haven’t had a dizziness attack in over 7 months, and my tinnitus is very soft, sometimes unnoticeable.

Im going to update this with more info while I learn more things, love you and 

Good luck!

I’m planning on visiting Colombo, Kandy and Galle as main centres and spend 3 days each in Colombo and Galle and 2 days in Kandy. The aim is to explore Srilanka culture, nature and city life in equal parts. Since I’ve made up my mind to make more trips in future, I am okay with visiting few places each time but exploring them deeply.

Since we’re cultural siblings, I’m not really worried about the language part and I have heard you people are really friendly.

Here’s what I want to know:
1. Is the places appropriate for the weather and time? My research says it’s good this time of the year.

2. I will make trips to Matara, Mirissa and Bantota as part of the trip to Galle. Should I skip or add anything?

3. I intend to travel light and want to keep most of my luggage in Colombo, is there any clock room services that I can trust and will be accessible round the clock?

4. I typically tend to carry local currencies rather than USD, but can I get any help with conversion on usage level? Like if a coffee in a cafe costs X LKR, then how many times of X would a good dinner cost? If 10kms of travel in taxi costs Y LKR And how many times of Y would a daily car rental cost? Something I can use as a measuring stick during the travel for negotiations and be sure I’m not being overcharged or scammed?

5. How is clothing norms in these cities? I know to dress modestly when visiting the monasteries, temples and even some monuments. But do I need to know any other no-go zones with clothing restrictions? Since my wife is travelling with me, how causal dressed are the people?

6. I’m planning to travel from Kandy to Colombo and then from Colombo to Galle on train the same day as I’ve heard the train journey is to die for. But someone also said the car journey from Kandy to Galle is also good. Is that so? And If so, should I opt for it?

I know it’s a lot, but this is my first time bringing my wife with me, and I want to be as sure as possible and plan in advance. Really don’t wanna look like a dummy. 😂

Moesko lied dead at the Hexblade's feet, our Paladin recovering the stolen conch from his body. Our Bard, holding tigthly the lifeless body of the woman she loved, shed silent tears of grief. Meanwhile, the Ranger, who had fought orcs, sharks and hags alike, kept a silent vigil on the group, and breathed in the salty sea breeze.

They had won.

All those weeks and months of traveling, fighting, making faithful allies and bitter sworn enemies. All the triumphs, the losses, the retreats, the chases, the mysteries, the explorations.

They started as a ragtag group of people; friends, colleagues, captives, avengers. They freed a village from its oppressors, cleared out the vermin that infested the land, thwarted the ambitions of an evil mage, slayed a dragon and wounded another, they became a bulwark against the orcish hordes, and finally, they defeated the mastermind of it all.

They had become heroes.

**Ashley**, the half-elven paladin. After mistakenly killing Moesko's hostage, the elven lady loved by her companion, she seeked atonement. After asking Daran to hold her badge of the Order of the Gauntlet until she had become worthy of the title, she rode out on a quest for redemption.

**Cynis**, the shadar-kai hexblade. Though his century-long lifespan was nearing the end, the Black Blade's name was still being whispered from mouth to mouth between adventurers and mercenaries alike. Rumours told of how his blade still thirsted for blood, and his soul demanded yet another worthy opponent. For the most part, he couldn't refute such claims.

**Duncan**, the aaracokra ranger. His bow ever-ready, his wits sharp as a knife, the archer had caught the attention of Falcon, the hunter of the lodge in Neverwinter Woods. The man asked him if he would've liked to work as a forest guard for him. It is unknown whether it was the respect for Falcon or the promise of a supply of Corwyn's garlic bread, but Duncan accepted nonetheless.

**Ryumi**, the dragonborn barbarian. His adventures started with the abandonment of her loved one, the elf anthropologist Etharis, and ended with her burial, not far from the Tower of Storms. Only in her last moments he knew who she really was: an agent of the Cult of the Dragon, whose mission was ultimatley undiscovered. Bitter and resentful, he parted ways from his companions before even returning to Phandalin. Which path his life will take, no one knows.

As the dice stopped rolling, through the cheers of all the other players at the table, and the final battle scene was told, everyone realized - the campaign was over.

The boss' mini toppled upon the map, struck down by a fateful, final critical hit - just before his turn could come, unleashing a Destructive Wave that could've laid waste on them all. Their happiness, their joy, their cheers resounded in the coffee shop we were playing at - as well as mine.

It was a tale that lasted more than a year and a half, a tale that started with only three players; one was lost after the first sessions, more were found along the way, all of them contributed to weave an unforgettable story.

I am helping organise a community secret Santa for children in Lower Hutt aged 13 and under. Grassroots, volunteer run (est. 2019). This year, we have a website with sign up forms.
I know lots of people are struggling right now but it would be magical if those who can, could check out https://www.huttcommunity.co.nz/
Three interconnected parts
1) Personalised presents for children to bring joy and relieve stress from families
2) An opportunity for people interested to connect. Santa Social Club with quizzes and raffles. Coffee shop open houses with me.
3) Support small businesses supporting us. Times are tight for small business but those that I have approached have been so generous. 
If we could get an engaged network of shoppers who would be buying gifts anyway we could:
1) Distribute more personalised presents and share community spirit
2) Feel less lonely, disconnected and isolated. Do good, feel good! (Rubin).
3) Support small businesses who care about their community which means they can support Hutt Santas more. 

Hoping to create a circular economy and community. We have clear kaupapa, a strong privacy policy and no institutional barriers or judgement. There is information on our fundraisers and other ways to help. 
I'm digging so deep because I don't want to turn away any children nominated! Amy is OG organiser and personally matches children with Santas (can try and pair according to interests). Any money fundraised will be divided by number of unassigned children at the end of November. At a minimum, we want to give a book, a treat and a handmade card.
We have some amazing small businesses donating books and treats. I'm going to be working with crafter/maker/artist/decorating/baking volunteers to try to add that sense of Christmas magic to my wider community.

I'm 17 and obviously I go on social media. I tried out many skincare recommendations/routines, claiming that it would change my skin and clear. In reality all the shit that we get marketed is SO unnecessary to our face. All the excessive toners, serums, eye creams, cleansing oils, face masks, UV light treatments, double cleansing and so much more. These skincare/makeup brands are trying to make us buy these super expensive products for little to no results. Half of the time it even makes our skin even worse and can make us break out. Even Dermatologist recommendations can sometimes still be a little dodgy in my opinion. Most of these influences get paid to feed you false information. In return as their audience we get an undisclosed advertisement, false results, and unrealistic standards. Why should us consumers pay the price and let these companies make a profit off our insecurities? Overconsumption is REAL and it's now being normalized in society. 

I fell victim to these marketing tactics last year and thought using 10 different toners would clear my skin? (apparently K-Pop idols use to get ""glass skin"") I also thought the Anua Toner and cleansing oil combo would work on my face (which really just lead me to have acne, redness, and many pimples) I was under the impression that I had to have this full routine filled with expensive products to help me get glowing skin. That shit is all fake and I think other people like myself need to snap out of that mentality. These products make us waste money, and on top of that make us feel bad for having not having perfect skin. 

If these products and/or having extensive routines work for you, your budget and your skin, I'm happy for you and I want you to continue !! But realistically not everything is going to work for everyone. At the end of the day our skin depends on genetics, our diet, lifestyle, if we pick at it, and what we decide to put on our face. Less is more. Keeping your routine to a few solid products that you know will work for you is probably my best advice! 

Take what you see online with a grain of salt and don't feed into these unrealistic standards corporate companies set for our skin. We are all human and realistically we don't need 20 different things in our face routine. The less on our face the better! 

As a bonus here was my very tiny skin care routine that worked for me in (2019-2021) and I'm going back to it again now!

1g2cehw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1g2cehw/sp_part_1_of_a_multipart_story/,[SP] Part 1 of a multi-part story,"Full disclosure, the speculative part pops up in later parts.

Men, Boys, and the In-Betweens

Some boys grow up to be men. Some grow up to be boys. Others can’t decide which they want to be until someone forces their hand. I don’t know that that’s a strictly male problem, but in this case, it is. At any rate, agent Danny Gleason was undecided until one day, Agent Marcus forced his hand.

He always entered the office the same way: perfect posture, mildly irritated expression, and an air of superiority that you knew he’d earned. He went to his desk­­—in back, hidden from the rest of us—without a word and began typing up whatever reports he’d left the night before. He never complained about the work. He never spoke at all if he could avoid it, and we all knew why—he was superior. And who would want to be around someone *that* superior unless they had to? Most of us didn’t. The rest of us made a point of trying to stress him out. W always chose stress.

I knew when W was about to cause mayhem. He would look at me with a micro smirk and turn slowly toward his victim. He’d done this forever with countless agents who had retired far too early, crying themselves to sleep at night because Agent W had spread paprika in their undershorts. He continued doing it because he could, because it was fun, and he shared Agent Harmon’s opinion that, if you couldn’t take pranks, you should probably get out of the FBI. I often considered intervening, but since no one *liked* his new victim, what was the harm? Besides, Gleason had proven that he could handle it. That just made it more fun for me.

I saw W’s smirk and returned it as he rose and made his way to Gleason’s desk. He did his best to seem innocent even though we knew he wasn’t. He looked at the packet sitting on the desk and picked it up. “Personnel reviews are in, huh?”

“Yes,” Gleason said absently.

“Have you looked yet?” W asked.

“I just got here. So no.”

“Are you going to?”

“No.” He kept typing.

“Nervous?”

“No.”

“Apathetic?” A logical guess.

“No.”

W frowned and looked at me. I shrugged. I didn’t get it either. He turned back to Gleason. “Then what’s the problem?”

“No problem. I know what it says.”

W laughed. “What are you psychic?”

Gleason looked at him like he was an idiot (fair), and said, “Yes.”

He held W’s gaze for a beat before typing again. W turned to me again with a freaked expression. Now it was *my* turn to look at him like an idiot.

He turned back around. “Then what does it say?”

“I failed and the boss man wants me gone. Which is perfectly fine since I don’t want to be here either.” He looked up and, whew! I thought *my* looks could kill! “Was there anything else?”

He returned to his computer without waiting for a response. W returned to *his* desk and shrugged at me. I grinned and chuckled silently. Then I heard a thunk in Gleason’s direction and looked to see the packet in the garbage. I had never seen anyone so sure they’d failed. He suddenly made more sense in a sad way. Why try to make friends somewhere you won’t last? But since it was easier to hate him…

“Body,” Marcus said.

Just like that, the action music started playing in our heads. Marcus had that effect on people. In fifteen minutes, we were on the road. In forty minutes, we were taking pictures of a dead lieutenant. Somehow, Marcus didn’t even take it as seriously than Gleason. One took time out of the case to stress that W must *never* touch his coffee; the other only saw death. The emo one happened to stand beside me, working on a crime scene sketch while I manned the Nikon. It felt odd to be silent, even with him, so I tried getting personal.

“What are you doing after work?”

“Sleeping. It’ll be tomorrow by the time we finish.”

“You’re not going out to get drinks or anything fun?”

He looked me in the eye. “What’s fun?”

Even though I tried holding it in, I could only laugh. The more I fought it, the more it wanted out, and in the end, it came out like a snort. I don’t snort. I thought he’d be annoyed, but I could swear I saw the smallest glint of happiness in those eyes. And here I’d thought he didn’t know what humor was!

He went back to his sketch. “Anyway, there’s not much fun to do here. I hate the city.”

I dropped the camera to my chest and looked at him. “Last week, you hated the country because there wasn’t enough concrete. Now you hate the city because it’s not fun. Is there *anywhere* you like to be?”

“No.”

“Is there anything you enjoy?”

“No.”

“Of course not! *That* would require having a personality!”

He raised his eyebrows, eyes still on the sketch. “Charming. I understand what W sees in you now.”

I looked at him, my face growing hot. “What are you talking about?”

He sighed. “Try and keep up. He’s clearly into you and, after the personality comment, I see why.”

He started walking away. I followed.

“You know, I may not be the most ‘charming’ person,” I said. “But I don’t *try* to be a jerk. That’s your specialty.”

“No, just now, I was responding in kind.” He stopped and turned to me. “And even if I *were* being a jerk for fun, at least it’s not a natural gift like it is for you. But since the defense of your feelings is my greatest priority, I wasn’t joking. I really *do* get what he sees in you.”

“What?” My face was burning.

“You’re a strong, independent woman who calls him out on his crap and always has his back. Why *wouldn’t* he like you?”

He walked away, and I stared after him feeling rotten and relieved. He had that effect on people. I hadn’t realized I could hurt him any more than I’d thought he could hurt me. Not so long ago, people thought *I* was cold. If anyone had mercy on him, it should’ve been me. Then I looked at W. He was doing something mean to Mac, but somehow, I was fine with liking him back.

The case was straightforward. Everyone did their jobs so well that Marcus didn’t even notice how many times W, Mac, and I stole glances at Gleason’s garbage. His folder still sat there. I spent the day wondering when he would take it out and brush the sandwich crumbs off it, or if he really *didn’t* care if he left. At any rate, we managed to wrap it up by midnight, and Marcus let us leave the paperwork for the morning. Marcus stayed like he always did, and Gleason didn’t move from his seat as per usual. The rest of us couldn’t get out fast enough. I got all the way to my car when I realized I didn’t have my keys. I let a “Shit” escape my mouth and went back inside. When I got out of the elevator, I found Marcus staring at Gleason. No one stares like Marcus. It’s like he’s looking for your soul and won’t leave until you bare it before him. Gleason had his packet in his hands, biting his lip. I’d never seen him indignant. He shook his head slightly.

“I’m sorry,” he said. “This doesn’t make any sense. I know I’ve made myself a pain, but since when do *you* care about that? W’s a pain! Heck, even Safi can be a pain, but you say you don’t waste good. I’m good. I’m the best, and you can’t say I’m not. There’s no way I failed.”

*He got a bad grade*, I thought. Then despite myself, *Good for him!*

“Why do you care?” Marcus asked.

To a stranger, it would’ve sounded like Marcus didn’t care either, but he’d asked me the same question before, so I knew better. He’d cared. He just wanted me to care, too.

Gleason looked at Marcus, eyes burning. “I- just- I don’t know!” He looked at the paper and shifted his weight. “I like it here. I’m doing something important *finally*, and I’m not gonna let you dump me. You won’t have a choice. You’ll *have* to keep me here because I’m gonna outdo Mac, Safiya, W—I’ll even outdo you.”

Marcus walked up to him. I didn’t have to hear him to know what he said. ‘I was never getting rid of you. It was just a push.’

1g2cbeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/SPTV_Unvarnished/comments/1g2cbeu/reese_exploits_her_son_more_while_calmly_taking/,Reese exploits her son more while calmly taking her fans shopping ,"Reese took her viewers on a shopping trip that many fans said was out of their price range today. H was there too and she put him to work on camera. She basically tricked her 14-year-old son into this by telling him she was taking him to the batting cages. On the way there, she asked him if they could ""drop by"" those stores and stream. He agreed. Reese says H is texting with Tommy a lot and that she spoke to Tommy ""probably four times"" yesterday.

She has changed her story now to say her breakup with Tommy was no big deal. She says Tommy is definitely her friend. ""I think my heart got a little bit broken, but I think his did too,"" she says. ""He didn't do anything wrong and I didn't do anything wrong."" When a fan reminded her that she had said Tommy did something unforgivable, she breezed right past it. ""Whatever I said, I said in huge rushes of emotion and now we know that shark week started today so that probably made it even worse.""

Reese casually says she forgot to put her Glow Drops on today. That's the Typology product she was pushing her fans to buy and trying to get a sponsorship for not long ago.

She's having H hold things she wants to try on and puts him on camera while he grins and says hello to her fans. She shows a shirt and says ""Oh look! That's the shirt I'm wearing right now.""

She's showing other clothes that she has bought at this store recently and worn on camera. Reese has so many clothes, and some of the people in her chat are saying the stuff at this store is too expensive for them.

Reese is saying she really likes the jeans at this store. I remember her saying after she got home from Nashville last year that she bought an expensive pair of jeans at a store in Tennessee and she doesn't know why because she doesn't like to wear jeans.

Many fans are requesting a ""regular"" stream, and she promises she will be going live later today from home too. The store owner has three connected boutiques and Reese shows her fans around all of them.

At the home decor shop, Reese shows a large piece of art that she wants for her wall. She says it's really expensive and she's wanted that for a while so she can stream with it behind her. Reese's mods pop up the phone number for the store so people can buy things from it. I wouldn't be surprised if Reese winds up with that piece of art on her wall soon. It's a peace sign and Reese says ""Wouldn't that be cool? After all the things from the channel and what we've seen and been through?"" She is sadfishing for this. ""I want it so bad,"" she says.

Reese says she likes the sign in her office that she already has, and she got it at this store. The sign in her office is huge and it must have cost a lot because Reese is reluctant to show the price tags of even the very small signs that can be held in her hand.

Reese just said that she doesn't have a Sugarboo sign, but she does. It's the one hanging in her office. I looked it up online. What a liar this woman is. ""I've always wanted something by that brand, but they're too expensive for me,"" she says.

Reese makes sure to come across a few sizes of the peace sign she wants so badly. After a chatter asks, Reese says the medium-sized peace sign is $280. It sounds like the size that she wants is much bigger. ""They're not cheap,"" Reese says. Keep in mind that this is the same woman who says she cannot afford weekly therapy appointments because a session costs $100.

Reese says if people are wondering why she's seeming a little down it's because she has raging cramps.

A chatter asks how much it would cost to buy H and Reese says ""He says he isn't for sale."" Then H comes on camera and says ""I've got the greatest mom in the world"" and hugs her. Reese thanks him and then immediately goes back to talking about other stuff.

When a chatter asks Reese what's going to happen to the Cults and Crims channel that she does with Tommy, Reese says she wasn't planning to talk about that yet, but she doesn't want Cults and Crims to die. She swore earlier this week that she would never speak to Tommy again and then said that they wouldn't stream together.

After this stream, Reese's fans should know that she's just a drama queen and they can't take anything she says seriously.

Once again, Reese's son is the one who's being caught in the middle. Now he's on camera again. A few times, she's kind of ordering him around. And he definitely doesn't look like the heartbroken, traumatized kid that she painted a picture of for her audience on Monday. She said then that H wouldn't want to have a relationship with Tommy anymore after what Tommy did to them.

The next day, she said maybe she would let H have some contact with Tommy once they put boundaries in place. Just a few days later, the brakes are off and it sounds like Tommy has as much access to H as he wants.

As the stream ends, she says she's going to get herself a drink from a fancy coffee shop and then take H to get something to eat. Then, at last, H will get to go to the batting cages.",17,1728774599.0,SPTV_Unvarnished,12,0.96,False

Sorry for my English, I’m not a native speaker.

I (40F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (39M)  for over two years.
We don’t live together but very close to each other.

I found out I was pregnant earlier this year. This pregnancy was particularly miraculous for me, as I’m supposed to be sterile due to severe adenomyosis and endometriosis, so this was the first time I’d been pregnant in years.

During this time, I was also preparing for a major professional challenge—a competitive exam. I was both excited and anxious about the pregnancy, and the added stress of the exam made everything feel even more overwhelming.

The week before my exam, I started experiencing intense pain. I went to the emergency room the night before the exam, where I was told that the pregnancy had stopped and that I would need surgery in about ten days.

That evening, we went home, and my boyfriend bought sushi for dinner. I went to bed early, trying to get some rest before my exam the next morning, even though I was emotionally devastated. The exam went well, mostly because I was on painkillers, but the pain didn’t go away. It became unbearable, and a few days later, I had to go back to the emergency room where they performed an emergency surgery.

Before being operated on a few hours later (as I wasn’t fasting), I went through an extremely painful experience because my miscarriage had started naturally. It was so traumatic that I had a panic attack in the operating room, and they had to put me under general anesthesia. My boyfriend was great at that moment; he waited until I was out of surgery and came to pick me up the next morning.

When I came home, I was physically and emotionally exhausted. Since I hadn’t been able to do groceries the week before due to the pain, I asked him to pick up a few essentials like coffee, bread, tomatoes, toilet paper, and fruits. 
Then after I got home, it was like nothing had ever happened. He never brought up the miscarriage again, even when I tried to talk about it. He would keep conversations on a superficial level—talking about the weather, watching movies, or gossiping.
Sometimes, I would cancel our meetings, telling him I was too depressed to see him. His reaction was to send me a sweet text with heart or unicorn emojis, wishing me ""good luck my love"". Then, for two or three days, he wouldn’t contact me, and when we met again, it was as if nothing had happened.

So I talked to him and asked why he wasn’t checking in on me or asking if I was feeling better. He said he thought me giving him an appointment was proof that I was getting better and that if I needed to talk, he was available. But in reality, whenever I brought up the subject between us, he would be very evasive and let the conversation die. 

Throughout our relationship, I’ve always been pretty vocal about managing my own traumas and mental health. I’ve been clear that I’m working on myself and don’t expect my partner to “fix” me, but I still want emotional support from the people I love. 

For the entire summer following the miscarriage, things didn’t change. He continued to be emotionally distant, maintaining a superficial relationship with me. We watched Netflix, talked about gossip, and cooked meals together, but the most important topic—my miscarriage—was never addressed. He never asked me how I was doing or how he could be there for me. He never acknowledged that I was going through a difficult time or even suggested that he would help me process it.

It was as if nothing had happened, and that was so painful. At this point, I thought he must be going through this painful event as well and that he might have difficulty bringing up the subject. But after adressing the topic once again, he said that from his perspective, he had his therapy sessions, which he said helped him ""process"" everything, and he felt fine because of that. Meanwhile, I was left feeling like I had no space to express myself, and it seemed like my grief was invisible to him.

Then, during an argument, he asked me to pay him back the €30 for the groceries he had bought me after my surgery. He has always been a bit stingy, despite earning three times my salary. But I didn’t expect him to ask me to reimburse him, especially since we mostly spend time at my place almost every day for the past two years.
He said for justification : “I don’t want you to think of that grocery trip as compensation.” It felt so dismissive and hurtful that he would ask me for money at that point, especially after everything I had been through.

I also felt unsupported when he decided to go on vacation alone, despite the fact that he was invited as a DJ to a festival, where he was paid generously, given accommodation, and food. On my end, my vacation budget was depleted because I had to advance the medical expenses for the surgery. He still left me alone, without any consideration for how I was feeling after everything I’d been through. He went on his trip without a second thought, while I stayed home, struggling with my emotions.

Eventually, I decided to break things off because I realized I couldn’t be in a relationship where I felt so alone, especially during such a vulnerable time.
But despite all of this, I still have some doubts about my decision because our relationship had been really good for the past two years. Even though I find him selfish and immature at times, the rest of the time he is tender, kind, clean, patient, and funny. Some of my friends think I should give him a second chance, but my heart feels closed.

Now I’m wondering if I was too harsh. AITA for expecting more emotional support from him and ending things when I didn’t get it?

I ordered it online and picked it up in the drive-through and I literally told the barista. I’m sorry it’s so excessive but it’s a birthday drink and she said “💁🏼‍♀️no girl pop off I love it”

1g2c8ob,https://www.reddit.com/r/travisandtaylor/comments/1g2c8ob/exswiftie_and_exkiss_army_here_taylor_honestly/,Ex-Swiftie and Ex-Kiss Army here... Taylor honestly reminds of a pop version of Gene Simmons a little bit. ,"Kind of a shitpost tbh, but this is a random thought I had today, particularly after the whole DWTS fiasco. I used to be a fan of both Taylor and KISS when I was younger, but I kinda grew out of both. 

Taylor's constant re-release of albums and releasing a copious amount of merch, though, sort of reminds me of the stunts Gene Simmons used to pull. 

- they both feel the need to constantly discuss their relationships with the opposite sex... Taylor with all her songs about her exes and don't even get me started on how GS constantly talks about women whether it be during interviews (polaroid collection..) or writing cringeworthy lyrics about them in songs.

- goes without saying, but the never-ending marketing of putting their brand on every product imaginable... Taylor with the overpriced merch, coffee mugs, kids' books, etc.. GS with literally making Kiss COFFINS, golf courses, soda, and selling.. BAGS OF AIR GUITAR STRINGS.. 

- They both have this weird ""i'm so edgy"" energy they try to project on and off stage.. Gene Simmons was literally out here writing songs with lyrics like ""I was raised by the demons  
/ Trained to reign as the one"" and ""And even though I'm full of sin / In the end you'll let me in"".. and Taylor has stuff like ""Got a long list of ex lovers/ They'll tell you I'm insane"" and we can't forget... ""But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time/ Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time/ I got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined""..

- They both try a little too hard imo to get crowd reactions when on stage... Taylor with the weird dance moves and Gene with the constant tongue wagging and clunky movements.

- They tend to both value quantity over quality when it comes to music. On his 1970's solo album, GS had the most songs out of any KISS member and most of them sounded pretty mediocre.. Taylor tends to release lots of mediocre songs with only a couple of songs that would be considered really good (if that). Not to mention, KISS has multiple variants re-recorded albums and songs that don't sound that much different from the original.. Taylor's got her own variant issue as well. 

  
Maybe I'm just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing if it sticks xD.. what do you guys think?",27,1728774357.0,travisandtaylor,8,0.94,False

I would love to be your friend! ","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm BlueExodia0. I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 28 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

I have 3 sets in the kitchen on top and below kitchen cabinets and a coffee and buffet table in my family room. The Govee LED controllers don't connect to WiFi anymore and I'm looking to replace them. I'm looking at [BTF-LIGHTING WS2812B RGB ECO LED Strip 30Pixels/m 150Pixels IP30](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088BB8WTZ/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A35UAT07QG3EC6) lights but am not sure what WLED controller would be best since I'll need 5 of them and what are good power supplies to use for them. 

  
For the cabinets I'll have a run and then need to run wire between that run and the next run and there are usually 3 sections but one has 4 sections.

Run Lengths in Inches (Number of LEDs per run) - *I checked this against the existing ones and the number of LEDs seemed to check out.*

|Cabinet 1|Run 1|Run 2|Run 3|Run 4|Totals|

|Top|60"" (49)||||60"" (49)|
|Bottom|147"" (120)||||147"" (120)|

Given these LEDs are 0.3W per LED from what I can find in the product specs, I then calculated the wattage and amps needed for each set

|Cabinet 1|Watts|Amps|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Top|20.1|4.02|
|Bottom|12|2.4|
|**Cabinet 2**|||

|**Coffee**|||
|Bottom|45|9|
|**Buffet**|||
|Top|14.7|2.94|
|Bottom|36|7.2|

  
So assuming my numbers in the Watts/Amps table are correct what are the recommendations for the controllers (I'm looking for WLED with Sound Reactive) and power supplies that aren't going to be super costly as I'll need 5 controllers and at least 5 power supplies assuming I can power each section independently. For the buffet and coffee table I can mount stuff under but trying to keep it as small as possible due to them having to be mounted on the underneath side.

EDIT:
Also what gauge wire should I be using between the runs to connect the strips?

Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

We had exchanged numbers and she messaged me saying she’d love to meet up this weekend and we arranged on a time & coffee shop to meet at. I double checked last night if we were good to go for this morning and she was on board. I get to the coffee shop on time and as time goes on and hits 30 mins I realized she probably ghosted me.. she texts me an hour later saying she overslept. I quickly respond “haha no worries!!” etc to keep a casual vibe because I understand that mistakes happen. She says she feels bad and I told her it’s ok cause I luckily brought other stuff to work on. There was no response or effort from her to meet up with me anyways or arrange for a different time. I feel so embarrassed that I was so kind to her.. I feel walked all over. It feels like was purposely ghosting and pulled out an excuse. 

My question is why make all this effort to meet up with me and waste someone else’s time if you don’t intend to follow through? I feel mortified and sad that this happened. ",1,1728773737.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
