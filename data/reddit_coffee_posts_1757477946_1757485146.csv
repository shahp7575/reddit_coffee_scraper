1nd6lzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/1nd6lzc/newbie_engineer_depressed_and_doubtful_for_my/,Newbie Engineer - Depressed and Doubtful For My Career (plz help),"As you can see by the title i‚Äôm sad but i have a job, thankfully. I am a CAD drafter for an HVAC contracting firm. So i, in autoCAD, look at photos field technicians took while on the job site, draw up what the duct work looks like, make the edits requested by project managers (like removing duct work and routing it in a different way and then demonstrating it on page) and then making a 3 to 2 page drawing package file. This is my job. This is what i went to school for for 4 whole years. sure i can move up into a project engineer role in about years time but im not sure if this fits my whole career path, even then am i too young to give myself a career path? if i do will i only be riddled with dissatisfaction?
Anyways my GPA wasn‚Äôt the perfect but also  3.47 isn‚Äôt something i can‚Äôt say i‚Äôm a little stoaked about. my capstone project was also interesting too. it was an automated beverage machine riddled with arduino and C code for a popular coffee shop in the PNW. i led the design for a custom seal proof fitting (it‚Äôs actually really cool i can‚Äôt lie im very proud of my solution for this) along with it being something that works well too, the design was entirely additive for i have 3D experience especially having to get such tight tolerance down on top of material selection etc, i had three internships for a fabrication and manufacturing company that i was both a drafter and a manufacturing intern at which i build tooling that increased the production of a product 66% (not a single person cares for some reason???), i designed, tested, analyzed in FEA and manufactured a tool cleat that reduced the amount of shoulder strain that would be felt by factory worker building computer boards for a company local to my college, i made an electric jet engine from scratch, i was part of our Rocket Club dealing with structurs and manufacturing for 2 years and also the secretary too, im literally normal also like im not antisocial???, im also currently self learning Ansys because idk simulation (claims not anti social yet is learning Ansys???) etc.
i don‚Äôt know what else i can be doing. i‚Äôm starting to lose hope and with my current gig i don‚Äôt know how i can pivot because clearly my current experience isn‚Äôt cutting it for any place i apply to. i think it just makes me sad, and gives me these disillusioned thoughts of self doubt which obviously never bode well. in some way hope people are in the same boat as me but i also don‚Äôt because i want my mech e and fellow engineers to succeed and thrive too.

should be stat padding my resume? do i need to come home and start doing more engineering for more experience? can i finally just like sit back and relax and just enjoy being home? 

i‚Äôve been applying for manufacturing, testing, process and mechanical positions but i can‚Äôt find one that will call me back. Hell i‚Äôve began to apply for MPE engineering roles too and nothing. I just wanna do either analysis work of any kind (i got a fucking call for a structure engineer job at an aerospace firm as one of my first interviews in May and i blew it‚Ä¶) and i don‚Äôt even mean designing airplane wings i literally mean analyzing anything or i want to work in manufacturing and manufacturing solutions.
I basically want to make things more efficient and help people. RnD work? all of these things require a Masters or a PHD and honestly i can‚Äôt weigh the Roi. 

am i freaking out, please. i think i need someone to just tell me they went this what i did and they got their dreams fulfilled and so will i. do i give up? 

i apologize for the rant im just at my limit. i feel lied to and because of it i feel like i didnt do enough in college and i wasted it.

help me

1nd6kss,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nd6kss,Tried Banana Leaf in Borivali West ‚Äî Benne Masala Dosa & Ghee Podi Idli,"I went to Banana Leaf recently, and while the ambience was quite nice, the food was a disappointment. 

The Benne Masala Dosa looked appealing when it arrived, with a cube of makkhan served on the side. But inside, it was just plain white aloo masala without salt, layered with oil and tasteless podi. It was more style than substance.

The Ghee Podi Idli (Mini Podi Idli) also turned out to be nothing special. The portion looked decent, but the flavour didn‚Äôt stand out at all. For a dish that should have been rich and satisfying, it felt very forgettable.

The chutneys seemed freshly made, but they had almost no strength of flavour. The sambar was drinkable, but not something I‚Äôd want to have again. To add to that, the filter coffee was served only after our food had arrived, which defeated the purpose, and even then it was just okay.

Overall, Banana Leaf feels like a place where the ambience takes priority over the food. At nearly ‚Çπ700 for a meal, the presentation looked good, but the taste didn‚Äôt justify the price.",2,1757484925.0,mumbaiFood,0,1.0,False

1nd6jqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToysAndTots/comments/1nd6jqd/colugo_compact_stroller_review/,Colugo Compact Stroller Review,"The Colugo Compact Stroller is a lightweight, foldable stroller designed for parents who need portability and ease of use. It first launched in 2018 and has stayed popular in 2025 because it balances compact size with enough features for everyday use.

At $325 (often discounted to $249), it costs less than competitors like the Babyzen Yoyo or Uppababy Minu while including a rain cover, carry bag, and cupholder in the price.

This stroller is aimed at:

* Families living in small apartments or with limited storage space
* Parents who travel often and need a stroller that fits into overhead bins on planes
* Those looking for a lighter, secondary stroller for errands or trips

It is not intended for jogging or rough-terrain use, and without the Infant Kit, it is not suitable for babies under 6 months.

# Key Specifications

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|Weight|16 lbs (aluminum frame)|
|Folded Size|17"" x 24"" x 10"" (fits overhead bins on most planes)|
|Unfolded Size|17"" x 26"" x 41""|
|Age Range|6 months+ (0‚Äì6 months with $95 Infant Kit)|
|Weight Capacity|55 lbs child + 10 lbs in basket|
|Fold Mechanism|One-handed accordion fold|
|Wheels|7"" puncture-proof rubber|
|Handlebar|Adjustable 38‚Äì42"" height|
|Canopy|UPF 50+, zip extension, peek window|
|Seat|Multi-position recline + adjustable calf rest|
|Storage|Large under-basket (no built-in pockets)|
|Warranty|1 year (with 100-day trial)|

# Everyday Use

# Folding and Carrying

The one-handed fold is quick and simple. Push a button and squeeze the handle to collapse it into a compact ‚Äúbrick.‚Äù It comes with a carry strap and padded bag, which makes it practical for stairs, airports, or storage.

# Maneuverability

The stroller handles smoothly in city environments. The swivel front wheels allow for tight turns, and the balanced weight distribution makes it possible to push with one hand. It rides well on flat pavement but is less comfortable on gravel or uneven paths.

# Comfort for Baby

The seat reclines to several angles. While not completely flat, it works for naps on the go. The adjustable calf rest supports younger babies or toddlers with longer legs. Ventilation panels on the back help keep the seat cool in warm weather.

The harness uses magnetic buckles, which lock together easily once aligned. Straps take some practice to tighten and loosen but are secure once adjusted.

# Comfort for Parent

The handlebar adjusts in height, which helps parents of different heights push comfortably. The storage basket is large enough for a diaper bag and a few extras, though it lacks small built-in pockets.

# Canopy and Cleaning

The canopy provides strong sun protection and extends with a zipper to cover most of the child‚Äôs body. The peek window makes it easy to check in.

All fabrics are machine-washable, which is a key advantage when dealing with spills or dirt. The seat liner removes for quick cleaning.

# Included Accessories

* **Rain cover**: Full coverage, easy to attach.
* **Carry bag**: Padded, fits the folded stroller, convenient for travel.
* **Cupholder**: Attaches to the handlebar, holds bottles or coffee cups securely.

These extras are included in the box, unlike many competitors that sell them separately.

# Optional Accessories

* **Infant Kit ($95)**: Converts the stroller into a bassinet-style setup for newborns.
* **Organizer ($45)**: Handlebar storage that doubles as a small bag.
* **Footmuff ($50)**: Keeps baby warm in cold weather.
* **Matching accessories** like totes and mittens.

# Strengths

* Compact fold that works for city living and travel
* Light but sturdy frame that doesn‚Äôt wobble
* One-handed push and steering
* Machine-washable fabrics
* Included rain cover, bag, and cupholder add value
* Large sun canopy with strong UV protection
* 100-day home trial for risk-free testing

# Limitations

* Not suitable for infants under 6 months without the Infant Kit
* No car seat compatibility, unlike some competitors
* Straps feel thinner and harder to adjust compared to premium brands
* Open seat sides mean toys or snacks can fall out
* Basket tips if heavily loaded and going over curbs
* Overhead bin fit may vary on smaller planes

# Comparisons

* **Babyzen Yoyo3**: More compact and car seat compatible but pricier and with fewer included accessories.
* **Uppababy Minu V2**: Smoother ride and larger canopy, but heavier and costs more.
* **GB Pockit**: Ultra-small fold for travel, but less comfortable for daily use.
* **Mountain Buggy Nano**: Similar price, lightweight, but harder wheels and basic harness.

# Final Verdict

The Colugo Compact Stroller offers excellent portability at a fair price. It is best for parents who live in the city, travel often, or want a reliable second stroller for quick outings. While it has some trade-offs in strap comfort and side support, its foldability, smooth handling, and washable fabrics make it stand out.

For families looking for one stroller to handle both home and travel, adding the Infant Kit extends its usefulness from birth through the toddler years. On sale, it delivers strong value compared to competitors.

**Score: 9/10 within the compact stroller category.**",2,1757484806.0,ToysAndTots,0,1.0,False
1nd6jhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Rootsla_420/comments/1nd6jhu/what_sets_our_recreational_dispensary_in_los/,What Sets Our Recreational Dispensary in Los Angeles Apart,"At Roots LA, we've built our reputation on more than just providing access to premium cannabis products ‚Äì we've created a comprehensive experience that prioritizes your needs, education, and well-being. Serving as both a medical and recreational dispensary in Los Angeles, we‚Äôre dedicated to both understanding and providing what cannabis consumers truly want from their dispensary experience.

# Our Commitment to Premium Product Selection

We curate our inventory with the same care you'd expect from a fine wine shop or artisanal coffee roastery. Every product that makes it onto our shelves undergoes rigorous evaluation for quality, potency, and consistency. Our buying team works directly with trusted cultivators and manufacturers throughout California, ensuring that whether you're purchasing [flower](https://rootslosangeles.com/categories/flower/), concentrates, edibles, or topicals, you're getting products that meet our exacting standards.

Our flower selection spans the spectrum from classic strains to cutting-edge genetics developed by California's most innovative growers. We maintain detailed information about each strain's cannabinoid profile, terpene composition, and effects, allowing you to make informed decisions about your purchase. This attention to detail extends to our concentrate offerings, where we stock everything from traditional hash to modern live resin and rosin products.

# Edibles and Alternative Consumption Methods

For those who prefer alternatives to smoking, our [edibles](https://rootslosangeles.com/categories/edibles/) section offers carefully selected products from established manufacturers. We stock a variety of dosages and formulations, from microdose options perfect for beginners to high-potency products for experienced consumers. Our team stays current on the latest research regarding cannabis edibles, including absorption rates and onset times, information we readily share with our customers.

Our topical selection includes creams, balms, and patches designed for localized relief. These products appeal to consumers interested in cannabis's therapeutic benefits without psychoactive effects. We work with manufacturers who use clean extraction methods and natural ingredients, ensuring these products meet the same quality standards as our smokable offerings.

# Personalized Service at Our Recreational Dispensary in Los Angeles¬†

The cannabis industry's rapid evolution means new products, consumption methods, and research findings emerge regularly. Our team commits to ongoing education, attending industry conferences, participating in manufacturer training sessions, and staying current with peer-reviewed research. This dedication to learning translates directly into better service for our customers.

When you visit our dispensary, you're not just interacting with sales staff ‚Äì you're consulting with cannabis professionals who can explain the differences between indica and sativa effects, discuss terpene profiles, and help you find products that align with your specific goals. Whether you're seeking products for relaxation, creativity, pain management, or social enhancement, we can guide you toward appropriate options.

# Tailored Recommendations Based on Your Needs

We recognize that every cannabis consumer has unique preferences and requirements. Our consultation process begins with understanding your experience level, preferred effects, and consumption preferences. First-time visitors receive extra attention, ensuring they feel comfortable and informed throughout their shopping experience.

For experienced consumers, we focus on introducing new products or strains that might enhance their current routines. We maintain detailed notes about customer preferences, allowing us to provide increasingly personalized recommendations over time. This approach has built lasting relationships with our customer base, many of whom have been shopping with us since we first opened our doors.

# Compliance and Safety Standards

Operating a cannabis business in California requires strict adherence to state and local regulations. We exceed these requirements, implementing additional safety and quality control measures that protect both our customers and our community. Our facility undergoes regular inspections, and we maintain detailed records of every product that enters and leaves our inventory.

All products in our dispensary come from licensed manufacturers and cultivators who comply with California's track-and-trace system. This system ensures that every cannabis product sold legally in the state can be traced from seed to sale, providing transparency and accountability throughout the supply chain. [Research ](https://www.jwu.edu/news/2021/09/7-potential-health-benefits-of-cannabis.html)highlights the importance of such regulatory frameworks in ensuring consumer safety and product quality in legal cannabis markets.

# Secure Environment and Professional Operations

Our Sun Valley location features state-of-the-art security systems designed to protect our inventory, staff, and customers. We've invested in professional-grade safes, surveillance equipment, and alarm systems that meet or exceed state requirements. This investment in security infrastructure allows us to focus on providing excellent customer service while maintaining the safe environment our community expects.

Our point-of-sale system integrates with California's regulatory tracking systems, ensuring accurate record-keeping and compliance with all reporting requirements. This technology also enables us to maintain detailed inventory information, helping us keep popular products in stock and identify emerging trends in customer preferences.

# Community Engagement and Education

Beyond our retail operations, we actively participate in Los Angeles's cannabis community through educational initiatives and responsible advocacy. We host informational sessions about cannabis laws, safe consumption practices, and the latest research findings. These events serve both new and experienced consumers who want to deepen their understanding of cannabis.

We maintain relationships with local advocacy organizations working to improve cannabis policy and expand access to legal products. This involvement keeps us informed about legislative developments that might affect our customers and allows us to advocate for sensible regulations that serve consumers' interests.

# Supporting Local Economy and Culture

Our commitment to Los Angeles extends to supporting local businesses and artists whenever possible. We prioritize purchasing from California-based manufacturers and cultivators, keeping our economic impact within the state. This approach not only supports local jobs but often results in fresher products and stronger relationships with our suppliers.

We regularly feature products from emerging brands and smaller-scale operations that might struggle to gain shelf space at larger dispensaries. This support helps diversify the cannabis market and provides our customers with unique products they can't find elsewhere.

# Convenient Location and Accessibility

Our Sun Valley location provides easy access for customers throughout the Los Angeles area. We've designed our space to accommodate customers with mobility challenges, ensuring everyone can comfortably browse our selection and interact with our staff. Ample parking eliminates the stress often associated with visiting businesses in dense urban areas.

The facility layout prioritizes customer flow and privacy, allowing for confidential consultations while maintaining the social atmosphere many customers appreciate. We've created distinct areas for different types of interactions, from quick purchases to detailed product consultations.

# A Medical and Recreational Dispensary in Los Angeles¬†

We leverage technology to enhance the customer experience while maintaining the personal touch that sets us apart from larger chains. Our online ordering system allows customers to browse our current inventory, place orders for pickup, and ask questions before visiting our location. This system saves time for customers who know what they want while preserving the consultation experience for those who need guidance.

Your journey with cannabis should be supported by knowledgeable professionals who prioritize your satisfaction and well-being. At Roots LA, we've built our business around these principles, creating a dispensary experience that goes beyond simple transactions. Visit us in Sun Valley and discover how our commitment to quality, service, and community makes us the right choice for your cannabis needs in Los Angeles.

1nd6hn6,https://i.redd.it/7bo1s7xy3aof1.jpeg,My 2 cents to people joining their MBA - By an IIM Bangalore Grad,"A batch of 2024 passout here.

1. Prepare well for your placements. If you don't have workex, do some internships, or whatever you can to fill up your CV with keywords before you join your MBA. Everything is all fun and happiness in those 2 years, but if you don't end up with a good job, many of us won't look at those times with affection.
2. Even if you don't have a profile good enough for getting into consulting, still prepare case studies and guesstimates. They for sure will increase your knowledge, structure your thinking and teach you excellent verbalisation of your thoughts. Read Case in Point till page 100.
3. Don't join your MBA without a good Master CV and having all the failures, achievements, learnings, PORs and impact of whatever you've done in your grad, school, personal life, workex and internships. This will save you 10x efforts while preparing your CV and batch profile as well as you'll already have answers to 80% of the HR questions.
4. Shortlists for summers and finals are a very random process. So don't get disheartened of all your homies and girls get good shortlists but you don't. You'll soon get one too. All you can do is prepare a good CV and then hope for the best. You CANNOT target a shortlist. That's not how it works. However if you are fixated on a company, you can do your fucking absolute best in its case competition and get a PPI.
5. Unless you want to get in the Dean's merit list or something, MBA grades don't really matter. Just don't fail anything. Anything above 7.5 is okay
6. The people around you decide what kind of 2 years you'll have. Trust me, you become an average of the people you spend your time most with. So find out good people and stick to them.
7. Be kind and polite and do a couple of things for those around you. Create a sense of reciprocity.
8. If the golden rule is ""Do to people what you'd like to be done to you"" then the platinum rule is that ""Do to people what they'd like to be done to them"".
9. Be respectful and talk well to people. Looks for sure matter, but not as much as we think they do and they're just an entry level criteria.
10. MBA is that time when you may or may not have money, but you have all the freedom you want. Make good use of it.
11. About s*x, I know a lot of us go into BSchools hoping that we'd get a lot of it. True, you can get a lot of it, given you look somewhat decent and have a good personality. However the irony is that after you do get a lot of casual s*x, you'll realise that casual s*x is not what you want. S*x as a form of communicating the love you have for someone is everything you need.
12. Relationships. Be clear about what you want: whether its something serious or casual or whether you don't have clarity. Be honest and communicate this to the potential partners you might be having. I've seen people giving false commitments and then withdrawing, leaving the other person broken beyond repair. Do not cheat. Don't hurt anyone, because trust me, when the hurt person has the last laugh, you'll be walking out of college with 0 credibility and respect. Have seen this happening very recently in my BSchool. Remember: DO NOT SH\*T WHERE YOU EAT.
13. Draw clear boundaries with people, and stick to them. What makes you uncomfortable, communicate about it.
14. Have a healthy relationship with alcohol, smoking and all other stuff. I know a lot of parties do happen and a lot of such stuff happens in them, but don't over abuse it. Alcohol fu*ks you up by fu*king up your health, your relationships and everything. A very close friend of my ex, who were IIM passouts in 2022 was engaged in multiple casual relationships at the institute, heavily drank, smoked and smoked up. Last year, she tried to kill herself by popping some pills. We saved her, but this is what overdoing things can lead to.
15. Not everyone is worth the effort. You'll find some people who are extremely selfish and will take a lot from you, but show their true colours when it becomes inconvenient for them. They will have 0 reciprocity. Instead of wasting your time on such people, focus on the ones you want to keep forever. However DO NOT burn your bridges.
16. People won't remember you for the gpa you got or the placement you got. They'll remember you for how you made them feel. So be a good person, be kind and very polite. Create a sense of debt in people. You never know which company you might want to get referred to in the future :)
17. Your health is extremely important: both mental and physical. Visit your campus therapist and keep exercising. Keep your room pleasent and clean.
18. Be very clear about money. It is the biggest factor that spoils relationships. Make splitwise your best friend. Talk to your circle and decide whether you'll be adding the 18 rupees sutta, 20 rupees coffee, 50 rupees auto kind of expenses to your splitwise. Because with time, the law of averages catches up and you all end up spending more or less equally on these miscellaneous expenses. But if only 1 or 2 people pay all the time, the amount unaccounted for can reach in 10000s by the end of 2 years. So be clear about this.
19. Use the CATS principle: Compliment, appreciate, thank, sorry. People who speak well do get an unfair advantage. Also, the quality of your network matters, not the quantity.
20. Learn about your summer internship company and if you do want to continue full time with it, give your best for a PPO. A PPO makes your second year extremely chill. Remember, getting a PPO is more about how you gel with your boss and the team. So be polite and respectful there as well. You may or may not achieve all your deliverables in the project, but what kind of relationship you had with the coworkers plays a large part in getting a PPO. The organisation where I was working at gave PPOs to 10 out of 13 people from by BSchool. The other 3 people had arguments a few times with their managers.
21. Get out of your comfort zone or your MBA will be just another 2 years of your life. A moment outside the comfort zone leads to a story for life. I took that leap of faith and now I'm a completely different person than what I was when I joined.

Finally, be humble, respect everyone and gaand faad mazze karo. You'll never have such kind of resources to spend ever again (one or more out of money, time, energy). All the very best üíØ‚ù§Ô∏èüíûüßø

P.S: Other people are welcome to add their own suggestions

Even in the best BSchools, there are always a few kids who struggle to get shortlists initially and get depressed. For 95% of the new batch, there is a tight slap that brings them back to reality from the bubble of getting into a top institute, and that is summers. If CAT XAT prep is 10, GD PI WAT prep is 100 then placement prep is 150. However I'll say it again. Don't dwell too much on shortlists. Keep doing your preparation. Me, with a 9/6/8 profile got shortlists of companies paying 3-4 lac+ stipends and got into one of those. I was shit scared when I didn't get shortlists considering my 6 and low workex and thought anything with a stipend of 50000 would be good.

Tell your grad profs, ex bosses at work and internships that you'll be seeking their approval for some CV points. If your BSchool just requires the domain of your ex company in the approval email, try to get your good friends/ ex colleagues at work to approve your points. That way thoda badha chadha bhi sakte ho, but don't lie and exaggerate so much that you won't be able to defend it if asked about it in interviews. Also stay on good terms with your boss so that they approve your points without too much of scrutiny in case your BSchool allows approvals only from your managers.

Use that Coursera/ udemy your company provides you before you join MBA to complete some courses in domains you like. They will add good keywords to your CV.

Making your CV is the toughest task you'll experience. You'll have to keep it within one page, limit a point to one line, add action verbs, keywords numbers and impact all in one line. Also you'll need to make CVs for different domains (marketing, finance, general, prodman, etc). So go to your college armed with a detailed Master CV. And show your CV points to many seniors, super seniors and make them absolutely sharp and crisp.

Use gestures as much as possible. Get your friends some homemade food, write your closest friend a note on how much they mean to you, or order some waffles for your roommate, take an ill friend to the hospital. On the last day of my summer internship, I bought 15-20 dairy milks worth 10 rupees and gave it to my managers, the HRs who handled us interns, my HRBP and other members of the team as a thank you. All of them got so so happy, I can't tell you. It felt like they were kids in a birthday party who got a large chocolate and a set of stationery as a return gift. Such gestures go a very long way and people WILL remember you very fondly for it, for all their lives and help you whenever needed for sure.

1nd6gk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1nd6gk1/forever_insomnia/,Forever insomnia,"Sorry this is a long rant (you can guess I am sleep deprived and desperate). 

TL:DR I have never slept well in my life, but got a taste of a regular sleep schedule for 3 years. I am back to barely sleeping and i dont know where to go from here.

I (38f) have never slept well my entire life. My parents always tell me and other people how little I slept from when I was a baby til I moved out of the house at 18 yo. I would pull all nighters for no reason through high school and inwould say on average, i slept about 3-5 hours a night. Ive also had anxiety (and panic attacks) as long as I can remember. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 14 yo after several ""attempts"". I was not medicated for either condition until I was 32 yo.

I did not start drinking caffeine until I was probably 24 or so, when I worked midnights for a year. I developed several unhealthy drug habits to try and depress my system enough to pass out most nights.

I started medical treatment for my bipolar in 2021. I was put on a drug that made me drowsy (and generally subdued) that helped me sleep 8-9 hours a night. I used to think sleep was overrated, probably because I had never slept well to begin with, but this was magical. I went from tossing and turning for hours to being able to fall asleep whenever I wanted. I would wake up refreshed everyday. 

Fast forward to 2024, I suddenly stopped sleeping well again. I could still easily fall asleep at 9 or 10 pm, but I would wake up around 2 am and not be able to fall back asleep. This went on for months. I had the most impeccable sleep routine and spoke to several doctors, including my psychiatrists office. I had recently switched to a new person since my previous doctor closed his business. The NP was very unhelpful, mostly just increasing my meds to the point that I unable to function and developed tardive diskinesia and other side effects. 

I was in such a deep depression and no doctor would prescribe me a sleep aid (otc did not work). I finally was able to get Lunesta from a doctor who specialized in mental disorders. And it worked amazingly! I was on Lunesta a week and my body reset and I went back to sleeping relatively well. I also switched bipolar treatment and that helped my mental state too. Once my body reset the sleep rhythm, I stopped taking the Lunesta. The doctor had originally prescribed me 30 pills in February 2025 and I still have 15 left in Spetember 2025. 

In the last month, my mental state has dropped so low (SI, anhedonia, depression) and i stopped sleeping again. I took Lunesta a few times and even upped the dose according to the label (I always took the lowest dose possible for as short as possible). But it has done nothing. Im at a loss. I want to note that my life has been the best its ever been this summer. I remember thinking about how much joy I felt a few months ago and how thankful I was that I had survived to this point. Perhaps it was an epidsode of mania and I didnt realize it until now.

The biggest change i can think of is that i stopped drinking alcohol a few months ago and am totally sober from everything. I drink half caf coffee and no other sources of caffeine (i also have a heart condition that doesnt do well with caffeine or alcohol).

I have appointments with my psychiatrist, therapist, and I will see my gp doctor soon too. But after knowing what good sleep was for 3 years, I am devastated.

So, I am up now just rambling to strangers because i dont know what else to do besides commiserate. ",1,1757484473.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

I am looking for someone to be with or talk to, particularly to meet after office, masyadong stressful na ang life, just wanna unwind and relax. Also looking for genuine connections. Willing to listen to your rants about life. You will know someone kapag makakasama mo rather than virtual. We build connections first before we meet because I do respect everyone's POV when it comes to meeting someone online. For your own safety lang rin. Tsaka para walang regrets. Let's just be true to each other para di sayang ang oras natin. 

A short background about me: I am from Sta Mesa, Manila, 5'7"", M, have high respect with woman, medyo chubby, knows how to respect boundaries and privacy, emotionally intelligent, working professional (legal field), INFP, Moreno, matangos ilong, nakasalamin, mabait. I do not demand time. If you are busy, then do your thing. I am not a type of person who will seek attention. I will update you most of the time but you are not required to do the same. In short, di mo kailangan gawin yung bagay na hindi naman ikaw, just act naturally. 

What am I looking here? I am just looking for someone genuine. Yung totoo. Basta let's be comfortable with each other. I never wanted someone to be creeped out. I am not a catfish, kung ano ako, yun ang sasabihin at ipapakita ko. Pero if you'll ask a preference, shorter than me, normal build, working professional, may time kahit twice a week or at least an hour a day, yung personality naman basta totoo ka, ipakita mo kung ano at sino ka. I can manage naman. Normal din naman sa babae ang pagiging moody, I can handle moodswings.

Where do we go on our first meet? Coffee shop even if I am not allowed for coffee (acidic) for your peace of mind or have dinner, do firing, watch move, travel, swim, city lights, or anything that we can bond with.

If we will be having a dinner date, we can eat somewhere in Manila or QC.

This is for someone who is will to have a date.  Not a fan of chat or virtual connections, my apologies!

Anyway a little about me. 
I work in an office.  It can be pretty mundane at times.  Until the gossip starts and we are getting close to all the nights out and parties so it should pick up soon. 

I love to workout and compete in some strength sports.  
But my main love so music. 
It‚Äôs a passion of mine.  
Like if I‚Äôm in a different city. Or country. I like to go find an old school record shop and have a look if something catches my eye. 

I‚Äôm from the uk. 
So if you say hello. You can expect banter. Laughs. A little teasing.  

So come say hello. 
Give me a little about you.  
Just one word hey. Or hello. Will not get a reply. 

So keep smiling. Keep dancing. And more importantly 
Get the coffee on. 
 
I was gonna say something a little more crude. But I would probably get banned.

I live alone in a nice house in a calm area, and a few things I enjoy are movies & TV shows, gaming (boardgames, card games, chess, video games), crafting & DIY projects, and cruising in my Star Trek themed Corvette. I‚Äôll also love candlelit dinners prepared by me for you ‚Ä¶or by us together with flirty mischief, kisses, and soft jazz music. I‚Äôve chosen a cruelty-free healthy lifestyle with no smoking, no drinking, no coffee, and an intermittent-fasting vegetarian diet (except for a few seafoods).

My passions include sci-fi (especially classic Star Trek, and it‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôve never watched it - you can discover it together with me), Asian style (as seen in my wardrobe and home decor), model kits (honestly, I‚Äôve got far too many), and intimate moments with someone special.

Some of my favorite music artists include Depeche Mode, The Cure, The Smiths, Enya, KISS (with makeup), INXS, 12 Girls Band, and composers such as John Williams, Hans Zimmer, and John Barry. Fashion is important to me when going out, and my style changes with my mood (and the weather) - sometimes ""goth"" studded faux leather, sometimes Asian-inspired silks, other times just casual t-shirt & shorts in summer or cozy sweats (at home only) in winter.

I‚Äôm seeking a sweet, young, affectionate, feminine ‚Äúgirlie‚Äù woman who prefers wearing dresses & skirts, has long-ish hair length (up top only‚Ä¶), naturally pretty and smooth complexion without needing makeup, and soft fragrance because as a deep Scorpio I‚Äôm very sensitive to scents. Regarding astrology, I‚Äôm supposedly most compatible with Pisces, Cancer, Capricorn, Taurus, or Virgo (and Scorpio could work also).

You should be female since birth, petite/slim, honest, faithful, caring, ethical, non-religious, and frequently ‚Äúin the mood‚Äù (love language of physical touch). Bonus points if you‚Äôre Asian, clingy and love hand-holding, hugs & cuddles, spooning, stealing kisses in public, artistic hobbies, holiday decorating, snuggling on a couch binge-watching movies & TV shows, gaming, and occasional weekend getaways. You should be serious about wanting a committed relationship based on mutual attraction, shared interests, and genuine respect for each other.

My dealbreakers: Must be at least 18 yrs old, no smoking (includes vaping), no alcohol (includes wine), no coffee, already or willing to be meat-free (except some seafoods), no tattoos at all, no piercings (except maybe earlobes), no kids, no pets, and no circus clowns. (Are you still reading after everyone else has left? Okay, I'm more impressed than Darth Vader seeing Luke's acrobatics...)

If this all seems ‚Äútoo picky‚Äù, well I‚Äôm quite self-aware and very much know what I want and don‚Äôt want with a companion, just the same as you probably having your own personal preferences.

I believe in-person dating is crucial for two people to truly get to know each other, but I‚Äôm open to temporary long-distance if we‚Äôre a good match.

The blood is bright red and shows up especially after I have coffee in the morning or red wine at night.

TLDR; You should not just use Apple international defaults for lower priced one time purchase apps. 


My initial Reddit posts was a huge success. One post drove 840 product page views and 22 sales in a single day (a 2.6% conversion rate). This was huge and quickly got me in the top 100 Paid Mac Utilities. It also got me an abundance of feedback, all of which I took action on. 

My biggest mistake was pricing. I set the app to $4.99 USD, but due to Apple's price tiers and VAT, it was selling for the equivalent of $8-$9 in Europe. I want the app to be the price of one good coffee, not two! I got feedback that it was too expensive across European currencies. Counterintuitively, when I tried a global price drop, my sales noticeably decreased (drastically)!

The solution was to manually set the price in every EU country to be 4.99. This cut into my margins in high-tax countries but has led to the most consistent sales. All of the comments on new posts about the EU pricing went away. (Although comments requesting it to be free will continue for all of time).

It's been a wild ride, but finding true product-market fit has been amazing. I get a surprising number of support emails requesting new features, and I am glad the app has that kind of community around it. I have seen a much better success on Mac apps compared to iOS.

Each day moves with small triumphs like finishing a deadline or reconnecting with a friend. But at night, when the lights are out and things get quiet, a certain emptiness sits right next to my bed. There is a chair that has always been there. I never picked it or decided where it should go, but it somehow belongs.

Some nights, it is easy to ignore. I get lost in my phone, jump from conversation to conversation, and let hours drift away. But sometimes, when sleep won‚Äôt come and my mind is busy, the chair feels very close. It does not say anything, does not offer comfort or judgment. Sometimes it seems to hold shapes from the past, like wishes that were never fulfilled or versions of myself I only met in daydreams. Other times, it is just a silent spot in a room that is otherwise filled with noise.

The chair does not tell me its name. I might call it loneliness or restlessness or just not knowing. All it does is hold space. It is the one place in my life that does not pretend or demand, does not need to be fixed or described. At the end of long days, I sometimes find myself sitting there, not really knowing why, legs tucked up, listening to nothing. It is then I see the chair is not a problem at all. It is just space. It is honest, not asking me to be anything in particular.

With time, I think everyone gets a chair like this. Some try to hide it under clothes. Some change rooms or move to new cities, hoping it will not come along. But it does, setting itself quietly in the corner no matter where you end up.

One morning I might stop moving and just sit with it. I make some coffee and notice how the light falls on its armrest. In that pause, the chair feels less empty. Maybe it even feels like a friend. Still quiet, but now it belongs. It is just waiting for me to accept all the space inside me.

Maybe what felt like emptiness was always an invitation. The chair remains, the most loyal thing in the room, waiting to be claimed.",1,1757483117.0,TwentiesIndia,1,1.0,False

Rain fell in thin needles across the city, pooling in the cracks of forgotten sidewalks. Detective Elias Klaus lit his last cigarette beneath a flickering streetlamp, staring at the crime scene tape that swayed like ribbons in the storm.

They said his fianc√©e, Anna, had been murdered. Stabbed in their apartment, no witnesses, no suspects.

But Elias remembered nothing from that night. Not her scream. Not the blood. Not even how he had got to the street below, drenched and trembling.

All he knew was this: he would find whoever did it. And when he did, he‚Äôd tear their world apart.

He did not notice how the officer sealing the tape did not look him in the eye.  
He did not notice how no one answered when he spoke.  
He did not notice how his breath no longer fogged in the cold.

Because Elias Klaus was already dead.

**Chapter 1 ‚Äì The Living Do Not Answer**

Outside, the city seemed to breathe with him. The hum of the neon sign, the whisper of rain against glass together they sounded less like weather and more like words he almost understood. Elias shook it off, telling himself it was only the storm playing tricks.

The rain had not stopped for three days. It rolled in greasy sheets down the windows of Elias Klaus‚Äôs office, painting the city in smudges of gray. The neon sign from the liquor store across the street blinked red into his walls, pulsing like a dying heartbeat.

Elias sat hunched at his desk, a cigarette clamped between his fingers, the smoke curling upward in delicate strands. His other hand hovered over a half-empty glass of whiskey, the liquid still trembling though he had not touched it in minutes.

On the desk lay Anna‚Äôs file. Photographs, interviews, grainy snapshots from security cameras all meaningless fragments. Her face smiled back at him from an old Polaroid, her eyes alive, luminous. The police report said she was stabbed in their apartment, no sign of forced entry, no witnesses. Case still open.

But Elias could not shake the hollow in his chest, that gnawing certainty that something was missing.

He shoved back from the desk and grabbed his coat. Sitting in the dark would not bring him answers. The city still whispered if he listened hard enough.

The streets were slick, lamps glowing halos in the mist. Elias‚Äôs shoes clicked against the pavement as he made his way to Anna‚Äôs building. The thin police tape still clung to the doorway like a spider‚Äôs web.

Inside, the lobby smelled faintly of bleach. Mrs. Donnelly, the landlord, was locking the mailboxes.

‚ÄúEvening, Mrs. Donnelly,‚Äù Elias said.

She froze at the sound of his voice. For a second, he swore she looked straight through him. Then she dropped her keys, stooped, and gathered them with trembling hands. No reply. No eye contact. Just the shuffle of her steps as she retreated quickly into her apartment.

Elias frowned. She had known him for years. Why ignore him now?

The apartment door groaned open with a push. The rooms were empty, stripped bare, but Elias swore he still felt Anna‚Äôs presence hanging in the air. He walked slowly, each step echoing too loudly in the silence.

The floorboards near the kitchen were creaked. Elias crouched. There, faint as a scar, was the outline of the bloodstain. The cleaning crew had done their work, but he could smell iron and salt clinging to memory more than air.

He moved into the bathroom. A cracked mirror leaned against the wall. His reflection stared back, hollow-eyed, skin pale under the flickering bulb. For a moment, something strange rippled across the glass, his outline seeming blurred, like smoke rising from a dying fire. He blinked, and it was gone.

Shaking it off, he lit another cigarette. Tomorrow he would start digging into Anna‚Äôs final days. Somebody knew something. Somebody saw something. He would make them talk.

Because Elias Klaus was not going to stop until he found her killer.

What he did not notice was that when he exhaled, the cigarette smoke curled into the air and vanished without leaving a single trace of breath behind.

¬†

**Chapter 2 ‚Äì Coffee for No One**

As he sat in the diner, he thought he heard the building creak, as if shifting its weight. The sound was almost a sigh. The city, in its own way, seemed to be watching him.

The diner smelled of burnt toast and cheap coffee. Elias slid into his usual booth, shaking rain from his coat.

A waitress passed by eyes on the floor. She did not stop, did not even glance at him.

He tapped the table. ‚ÄúBlack. No sugar.‚Äù  
No response.

Elias muttered a curse, but when he looked down, a steaming mug of coffee already sat in front of him. He had not seen anyone put it there.

Across the room, a kid stared at him over a plate of pancakes. Big brown eyes, unblinking.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stare,‚Äù the mother whispered, pulling the child close.

‚ÄúBut, Mama,‚Äù the girl said, her voice carrying in the hush of the diner, ‚Äúwhy‚Äôs the sad man all gray?‚Äù

Elias stiffened. His hand froze halfway to the coffee.

The mother shushed the girl, grabbed her by the wrist, and hurried out, leaving their plates half full.

Elias‚Äôs eyes followed them to the door. Something cold settled in his chest.

He did not drink the coffee. Instead, his gaze drifted to the faded photograph tucked in his coat pocket. He drew it out carefully, as if handling glass, and felt the warmth of a memory long tucked away. The edges were worn, the colors soft, but it carried a trace of laughter, of sunlight, of a world that had once felt alive in a way the diner never could.

And then, before he could stop it, the memory came, bright and insistent, pulling him backward through time.

¬†

**Chapter 2.5 ‚Äì Flashback I: How They Met**

He had been wandering through a crowded street market, lost in thought, when he collided with a stranger.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry!‚Äù he had exclaimed.

The woman laughed, a light, lilting sound that seemed to echo in his chest. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. Really.‚Äù

And just like that, their worlds had intersected. Anna, she had a way of looking at everything with a quiet curiosity, and he had been instantly captivated. They had spent the day exploring the hidden corners of the city, sharing stories, dreams, and laughter. Elias had felt something he hadn‚Äôt known he was missing.

That chance encounter had become a turning point, the first thread in the tapestry of a life they would build together.

¬†

**Chapter 3 ‚Äì Whispers in the Alley**

The alley‚Äôs shadows clung too tightly, pooling in unnatural shapes. The city‚Äôs voice was louder here, a chorus of whispers in brick and rain. Elias wondered, for the first time, whether the city itself was keeping secrets.

The city always spoke loudly in its alleys. Elias Klaus walked them like a priest through confession, listening for sins.

He found Frankie Doyle behind the Blue Lantern bar, lighting a cigarette with shaking hands. Frankie was a runner and always knew what shadows moved where.

‚ÄúFrankie,‚Äù Elias said.

The man jumped, eyes darting into the dark. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me.‚Äù Elias stepped closer, rain dripping from his hat. ‚ÄúWe need to talk about Anna.‚Äù

Frankie‚Äôs face went white. He dropped his cigarette, crushed it under his heel, and backed toward the wall.

‚ÄúChrist‚Ä¶‚Äù Frankie whispered. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt be what?‚Äù Elias snapped. ‚ÄúShe is dead, Frankie. Someone did it, and I want a name.‚Äù

Frankie‚Äôs breath came quickly and shallow. He would not meet Elias‚Äôs eyes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know nothing,‚Äù he stammered, fumbling with his lighter. His hands shook too hard to spark it. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ leave me alone, Klaus. Please.‚Äù

Elias grabbed him by the collar. ‚ÄúYou think I won‚Äôt drag it out of you?‚Äù

Frankie‚Äôs lips trembled. He was not looking at Elias anymore; he was staring through him.

‚ÄúI swear,‚Äù Frankie gasped, ‚ÄúI did not mean to see it‚Ä¶ I did not mean to see you‚Ä¶‚Äù

Elias‚Äôs grip faltered.

But before he could press him, Frankie tore free, bolted down the alley, and vanished into the night.

Elias stood alone, rain dripping down his coat, a cold wind cutting through his bones.  
What the hell did Frankie mean by seeing you?

A sudden memory warmth, laughter, and the small apartment he and Anna had shared crept into his mind, offering a fleeting comfort amidst the cold shadows of the alley.

¬†

**Chapter 3.5 ‚Äì Flashback II: The Early Days**

Elias remembered the small apartment he had rented, cluttered but warm, filled with the scent of Anna‚Äôs cooking and the quiet hum of evening conversations. They had spent nights talking about everything and nothing, about the worlds they wanted to explore together and the dreams they hoped to chase.

Anna had insisted on painting one wall bright yellow; a color Elias had hated at first, but which had come to symbolize hope, warmth, and laughter in their lives.

They were young, imperfect, learning how to navigate life together, and yet, those small moments the shared laughter, the quiet evenings, the simple touch of hands had bound them in ways neither had fully understood at the time.

It was in those moments Elias realized that life‚Äôs meaning wasn‚Äôt in grand gestures but in these fragile, fleeting seconds of connection.

¬†

**Chapter 4 ‚Äì The Empty Call**

Back in his office, Elias Klaus tossed his soaked coat across the chair and stared at the phone on his desk. Frankie Doyle‚Äôs words kept echoing: I did not mean to see you.

The phone rang.

The sound cut through the room like a razor. Elias snatched it up.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

Static crackled, then a voice, faint, trembling.

‚ÄúElias‚Ä¶‚Äù

His heart clenched. Anna‚Äôs voice.

He gripped the receiver tighter. ‚ÄúAnna? Where are you? Who‚Äôs got you?‚Äù

The line hissed, broken, full of whispers that bled like water through stone.

‚ÄúYou have to stop‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not‚Äù Her voice cracked, dissolving into static.

‚ÄúNot what?‚Äù Elias shouted. ‚ÄúAnna! Tell me!‚Äù

The line went dead.

Silence filled the office. Only the ticking of the clock on the wall remained.

Elias slammed the receiver down, chest heaving. His hands shook as he reached for his cigarette case. But the flame of his lighter would not catch. He stared at it, confused. No heat. No burn.

And in the window‚Äôs reflection, for just a second, Elias thought he saw himself faded, hollow, like a photograph left too long in the sun.

¬†

**Chapter 4.5 ‚Äì Flashback III: The Proposal**

It had been a rainy evening, the kind that made the city glimmer under the streetlights, every puddle reflecting tiny fragments of the world. Elias had led Anna to a small, hidden garden and he had discovered weeks prior a quiet place where the rain didn‚Äôt seem intrusive but protective, almost magical.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you found this place,‚Äù Anna had whispered, her voice full of wonder.

Elias smiled, his hands brushing hers. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more to life than what we see on the surface. I wanted to show you something‚Ä¶ something that‚Äôs ours.‚Äù

He reached into his coat and pulled out a small, velvet box. Her eyes widened as he opened them, revealing a delicate ring that seemed to catch the raindrops like tiny stars.

‚ÄúAnna,‚Äù he said softly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent every day trying to imagine a life with you. Will you let me continue imagining it‚Ä¶ together?‚Äù

Tears glistened in her eyes as she nodded, laughter and relief blending into a single moment. The rain fell harder, but they didn‚Äôt move. They didn‚Äôt need to. In that fleeting eternity, the world beyond the garden ceased to exist.

It was a beginning, yes, but also a promise that no mystery, no darkness, could ever undo.

¬†

**Chapter 5 ‚Äì The Morgue**

As Elias stood among the drawers of the dead, the hum of the fluorescent lights rose and fell in rhythm, like the slow breathing of something vast and unseen. He shivered, unsettled by the thought that the city itself might be exhaling all around him.

The morgue smelled of disinfectant and metal. Elias Klaus hated it, but he needed answers.

Dr. Halloway, the coroner, shuffled papers behind his desk. Elias stepped forward, slapping Anna‚Äôs file down hard.

‚ÄúI want the report. All of it.‚Äù

Halloway did not move. Did not even blink.

‚ÄúDoc,‚Äù Elias growled. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt play deaf with me.‚Äù

The coroner‚Äôs pen slipped from his fingers, clattering against the tiles. His eyes fixed on the wall just past Elias‚Äôs shoulder.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù Halloway whispered.

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt be where?‚Äù Elias snapped.

Halloway stood suddenly, chair screeching back. His hands trembled as he gathered the file, clutching it to his chest like a shield.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he said, his voice breaking. ‚ÄúGo back to your grave.‚Äù

Elias froze. The words slammed into him harder than any bullet.

‚ÄúWhat the hell did you just say?‚Äù

But Halloway bolted for the door, leaving Elias alone among the cold drawers and silent dead.

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Elias‚Äôs fists tightened. Grave. What did he mean grave?

A memory, warm and golden, surfaced unbidden reminding him of life before death, of their first home together.

¬†

**Chapter 5.5 ‚Äì Flashback IV: Their First Home**

After the proposal, Elias and Anna moved into a small apartment in the heart of the city, a cozy space with mismatched furniture, creaking floorboards, and sunlight that streamed through large windows every morning.

It wasn‚Äôt luxurious, but it was theirs. Anna had painted one wall a soft lavender, while Elias had filled the shelves with old books and records, he had collected over the years.

They cooked together in the tiny kitchen, sometimes burning the rice or over-seasoning the stew, laughing so hard that tears ran down their cheeks.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need much,‚Äù Anna would say, holding his hand across the table. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ this.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd this is everything,‚Äù Elias would reply, feeling the weight of the world lift from his shoulders whenever he looked at her.

Evenings were spent reading side by side, or wandering the streets of their neighborhood, discovering little cafes and street performers, the city‚Äôs pulse intertwining with their own.

It was a life built slowly, carefully, with laughter, love, and the kind of patience that only time could teach. They had everything they needed each other.

¬†

**Chapter 6 ‚Äì The Shadow in the Mirror**

The morgue‚Äôs words gnawed at Elias Klaus‚Äôs mind as he stumbled back to his office: Go back to your grave.

He poured whiskey into a glass, but the liquid had no burn, no warmth. He stared at it, hands shaking.

The mirror above the sink caught his eye.

He walked over slowly, every step heavy. His reflection stared back skin pale, eyes sunken.

Then it flickered.

For a heartbeat, the reflection was not him at all. It was a gray, hollow figure, face cracked like broken porcelain, smoke curling from its mouth.

Elias gripped the sink. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is happening to me?‚Äù

The figure in the glass did not move with him this time. It leaned closer, whispering words he could not hear, fogging the inside of the mirror.

Elias slammed a fist against the glass. It shattered; shards scattered into the sink.

When he looked again, the reflection was gone. Just broken pieces, each one catching a pale, empty sliver of his face.

His chest tightened. Frankie‚Äôs fear. Anna‚Äôs broken call. The coroner‚Äôs words. None of it made sense.

What helps YOU get most out of the ""good"" and the least out of the ""bad"" ?","I just finished did my first week on Vyvanse 30mg! I took it 5/7 days. Its helped me so much with being active for the first time in a long time, focusing in school, eating less, etc. I can give the long breakdown of how all days I had different durations of effects (so long and short), crashes (?), appetite ups and downs, amazing feelings of calm and happiness at onset, but more often irritability, moodiness in the evening etc... but I kind of had different habits every day, e.g. on a day when I ate no protein I basically felt 1 hour of good focus and basically no mental stim after 2pm, followed by many hours of moodiness and anxiousness so much so I had to take a bit of Xanax because I was so out of it.

I'm building regime for weekdays only, and want it to feel that great onset high but and sustain most of the day into the evening. Personally, My classes are 2pm - 9pm most days, after an 11am workout. I also then want it OUT of me by 10-11pm so I can sleep happily. 

I'm just trying to tackle the weekdays so far, and I'll get a hang of the going-out sleeping late but still wanting my stim at least one productive day on the weekends soon enough. 

For now, this is what I am building to help take some stress out of this. Please add to my running list what I am missing, and what has worked great for you to keep that sustained mental focus, and also get it out of you by bedtime.


VYVANSE WEEKDAY REGIMEN

1. Please minimum 7-8 hours of sleep
2. Dose btwn 8 a.m. - 10:30 a.m.
3. Zinc, Vitamin D, B-Complex, EPAs,?? What are we taking in the morning to sustaine effects, balance, + minimize anxiety/mood rebound?
4. Breakfast sandwich within 1 hour OR
* 2 eggs + protein smoothie (Protein with calm and happy effect)
4. 1 Matcha or 1 cup of coffee but not more for now. Maybe half or full decaf.
5. Have a workout when the effects are still strong + Creatine gummies üí™üèª
6. At plateau (I've felt as early as 1pm or as late as 5pm), L-Theanine to sustain, Saffron for mood to help with incoming crash? I've been so moody in the afternoon/evening!
7. Eat something with protein + fiber for lunch
8. Drink enough water with electrolytes through the day
9. Have enough dinner. High protein? Carbs? Fats?
10. Wind down: Vitamin C 1000mg after dinner, Arrae Magnesium (Citrate, Theorate, Bistlycinate) Complex, Arrae Calm (Inisotol, L-Theanine, Mag Glycinate) 8pm - 10pm
11. Maybe 0.5 - 1mg Melatonin
12. Goodnight! üíôüí§üò¥üò¥

*Try titrating meds in measurable water bottle, might be able to take 20mg in morning and 10mg closer to 1pm at plateau and before 2pm classes? Will talk to my doctor about that. Not sure if it will help with sleep but I'll see. She didn't even mention that to me yet, but I'm switching my provider. She doesn't really know much about ADHD med management.

*Carry emergency protein bar / electrolyte powder because damn those HEADACHES!!

Questions:

1. CAFFEINE??? Why when I first take Vyvanse as the onset starts to happen I crave a lot of caffeine to keep the high? It's coke effect like... you want more and more. That feeling doesn't last more than 2 hours. The morning caffeine doesn't make me anxious either and I feel very energized and happy. As that starts to smooth I still crave the upkeep of the peak but less. Sometimes at 2pm it just feels like background noise but it needs to feel enough to focus without being wired. In the afternoon is the morning coffee why I feel like shit, irritable, anxious? Is it relative to food/protein intake or lack thereof instead? Both?

2. Genetic testing will actually help you determine you I metabolize stims? And which ones best? One doctor recommended that.

3. High acidity foods/coffeemake meds wear off faster? Magnesium/Potassium Citrate helps acidity so take that in the morning? Any more sips/foods that will sustain the Vyvanse longer? Any that will keep it from working besides Vit C or Acidity?

4. What is the low mood/ depressed feeling about in the evening? Is that a side effect or just me? Prone to it a bit but not as much as this week.

5. Anything I can do for feeling like a Zombie sometimes socially? It persists even at night. Better than chasing dopamine doing wild things as I used to do... but I still did dump a G&T on my ex's head at the bar.

6. SLEEP? Finally, how has sleep or lack of sleep impacted the next day on your meds? 5 hours versus 8 hours what are the changes you're feeling?",5,1757482409.0,VyvanseADHD,2,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Hey r/GPTAppsEngine fam!

Has anyone else noticed the absolute rocket ship pace at which AI automation is transforming our daily lives? One moment I‚Äôm typing prompts, the next I‚Äôm reading about research labs automating entire workflows, customer support bots tackling crazy advanced requests, and new coding copilots that feel borderline magical. üöÄ

Here‚Äôs the wild thing: This stuff is everywhere, and somehow the novelty *still* hasn‚Äôt worn off for me. Every week brings another glimpse into a future where AI helps with tasks‚Äîbig and small. It saves time, fills gaps, and gives humans the space to get creative and strategic.

A few thoughts that have really excited (and sometimes surprised!) me recently:

- Tiny bots flipping pancakes of opportunity on social media, analyzing sentiment, flagging trends, and scheduling posts all while I take my coffee break  
- Code that practically writes itself with explainable commentary so debugging is painless (okay, almost painless...)  
- Businesses scaling customer service with chatbots that respond instantly‚Äîand often more accurately than the old ‚Äúpress 4 to speak to an agent‚Äù days  
- Automated research assistants pulling up sources, highlighting key points, and formatting bibliographies (my university self sobs with gratitude)

Is there anxiety about automation replacing jobs? Of course. But I keep seeing two sides to that coin, and the flip side is full of possibility. What if this is our ticket to eliminating drudgery? Every minute saved from repetitive work is a minute earned for creative problem-solving, connection, and growth.

Some open-ended questions spin around my head:

- If repetitive work drops off our plates, what will we do with that freed-up brainpower?
- What new roles and skills might emerge as AI automation becomes standard in every industry?
- How can we make sure automation is something that uplifts everyone rather than creating new divides?

The best part: We‚Äôre not just bystanders. Developers, creators, and curious tinkerers like us get to help shape this world. The more we experiment, share, and learn together, the more we can nudge this automated revolution in a direction that‚Äôs smarter *and* kinder.

What‚Äôs the coolest thing you‚Äôve automated lately? Or‚Äîwhat task do you WISH an AI could take off your plate next? Let‚Äôs brainstorm, dream big, and celebrate the bright side of bringing automation into the everyday!

The wedding band gleamed on his finger like a cruel mockery, stabbing into my eyes.Before I could even process it, two anonymous emails landed in my inbox.I opened the first, and several high-definition photos came into my view.In the first photo, Damian was down on one knee, cradling a cute girl in a puffy dress.

I'll negotiate the terms with Damian,"" I told her.The photos cost me 1.5 million dollars, but it was nothing compared to the reputation of the Caldwell Group's CEO.With the photos, I surely held a strong upper hand in the negotiations over the property settlement.I printed out the agreement, put it on the coffee table, and called Damian.The call connected almost instantly-only it wasn't his voice.""How may I help, Ms. Whitmore? Dami is tucking Maureen in.""Eleanor's gentle, sugary tone cut me like glass.So, she knew about me.I had assumed that Damian had lied to her about being single.Turned out she knew he was married but stayed his mistress anyway!Not bothering to waste energy on her, I said coldly, ""Put Damian on the phone.""Chapter 2""I'm sorry, Ms. Whitmore. Maureen won't let him leave her sight, so he's not available right now. Whatever it is, you can tell me. I'll pass it along.""She still sounded so gentle.Just then, Maureen's voice rang out. ""Daddy, can I still see you after I wake up tomorrow? You always disappear before I realize it.""Damian coaxed her tenderly, ""Of course, you can. I promise I'll still be here tomorrow morning.""My heart clenched with pain. I couldn't even remember the last time he had shown me such gentleness.""Ms. Whitmore, do you need anything else? If not, we're going to rest now.""Eleanor's words dripped with feigned politeness-but every syllable was a dagger.""Yes, I do,"" I said. ""Tell Damian to come back and sign the divorce agreement!""Eleanor fell silent, either out of disbelief or excitement.I guessed it was excitement, though. After all, with me out of the picture, she could finally become Damian's wife.I hung up and sat by the coffee table, waiting for Damian to come back.A night had passed, yet he was still nowhere to be seen. Early in the morning, his assistant, Patricia Sutton, knocked on the door.The moment Patricia entered the door, I sensed her hostility.She had been his assistant for three years, and I could tell he was more than a boss to her.Noticing the fatigue on my face, she said with a complacent grin, ""Mr. Caldwell's kept you for nearly four years, and now, he's marrying Ms. Hartwell. It must be killing you, huh?""Kept me?I couldn't help but sneer inwardly.Yes, what I had with Damian was a secret marriage.Four years ago, the Caldwell family elders all strongly opposed our marriage due to my humble background.Eventually, I caved and accepted that there'd be no wedding.Other than our closest ones, no one knew we were a married couple.Back then, Damian stroked my hair and apologized for the unfair treatment I'd endured. With distress in his eyes, he swore he'd throw me a grand wedding once he secured the inheritance of the Caldwell Group.It had been so long since he secured the inheritance, yet he had never mentioned anything about the wedding.So, till now, Patricia still thought I was his kept woman.She said, looking all high and mighty, ""Mr. Caldwell asked me to find out who posted those photos online. And you know what? Everything tracked back to Polaris Media. You're the editor-in-chief of the Entertainment Department. Don't tell me you know nothing about it.""Could Damian be any more shameless?He cheated on me. Instead of explaining to me, he put the blame on me?I said expressionlessly, ""It wasn't me.""Patricia snorted, ""Save it. The proof is right in your face. I suggest you own up to it and leave Mr. Caldwell before he dumps you. Imagine how humiliating that would be.""Just then, I stood up and slapped her in the face.Stunned, she covered her cheek and looked at me in great disbelief.I tossed the divorce papers in front of her and turned around. ""You don't get a say in things between Damian and me. Get out!""She gaped at the divorce papers.""You're married to Mr. Caldwell?""Then she realized Damian was with Eleanor. Gritting her teeth, she smiled coldly with hatred, ""Mr. Caldwell has put me in charge. If you keep denying you're the one who leaked the photos, go to the family chapel and stay there to think about what you've done. Don't come out until you're ready to admit your mistake. After all, Ms. Hartwell is still crying because of the scandal.""Utterly pissed off, I let out a derisive laugh.Damian cheated on me.And I ended up being the one who made a mistake?Chapter 3She continued, ""Or feel free not to go. Just a friendly reminder-the cardiopulmonary support system keeping your vegetative mom alive is developed by the Caldwell Group. It won't be released for another month. Before that, Mr. Caldwell can have his man pull the plug at any moment. Your mom will be left to die.""Damian was even more ruthless than I had imagined.He knew so well that my mom was the only blood family I had left in this world.Eventually, I compromised and entered the family chapel.The faint scent of cedarwood filled the air, just as inescapable as Damian's presence.At this precise moment, I was much more clear-headed than ever-I wanted a divorce.The maid, Shelly Mitchel, was utterly anxious. She begged Patricia, ""Ms. Sutton, please, could you let Mrs. Caldwell out? The chapel is so cold. She'll freeze!""My baby passed away three years ago. After offering me a few lukewarm words of comfort, Damian flew around the world, claiming it was for work.What he never knew was that I spent countless nights in the chapel, praying to see my child just one more time.Instead of resting and recovering, I devoted my days and nights to prayer, barely eating a thing. It was then that my health began to fail, and I grew weak and frail.To make matters worse, it was the rainy season. The relentless dampness seeped into my bones, and it wasn't long before I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.Even the doctors were perplexed. How did someone so young develop such a disease?They told me it was irreversible. On rainy days, I could only rely on medication to get through the pain.Even Shelly knew about this, yet Damian had no idea.Patricia coldly turned around, ignoring Shelly's plea. Biting her lip, Shelly said to me, ""I'll call Mr. Caldwell now!""Enduring the searing pain in my knees, I said through gritted teeth, ""No. Don't call him, Shelly.""I didn't tell him before because I didn't want to upset him.But now? I simply didn't feel the need.Because he wouldn't feel sad for me at all.Shelly stubbornly called him anyway.As the call came through, a little girl's childish voice rang out. ""Who is it? Daddy is accompanying Mommy to buy clothes.""I let out a self-mocking laugh.It had been ages since Damian changed his phone passcode. He'd never let me so much as touch it.I used to think he hated anyone violating his privacy.It never occurred to me that he simply didn't want me near it. His mistress and their daughter, on the other hand, could have it whenever they pleased.Hearing the girl's words, Shelly was dumbfounded. She quickly checked the number again and confirmed it was Damian's.Upon seeing the look on my face, she instantly knew what was going on and hung up.I curved my lips into a smile, yet my eyes were devoid of any emotion.Soon, my strength gave way entirely. My legs buckled and I collapsed, my knees hitting the floor with a thud. Seeing blood oozing from my knees, Patricia smiled coldly and turned to leave.Just before closing the door, she clapped her hands mockingly. ""Good job admitting your mistake. As your reward, I won't report this to Mr. Caldwell.""As soon as she was gone, Shelly rushed to my side and helped me back to my room.Every step I took sent a sharp, stabbing pain through my feet, as if I were walking on knives.Shelly said indignantly in a sobbing voice, ""How could Mr. Caldwell do this to you, forcing you to stay in the chapel for hours while buying clothes with his mistress? And the little girl...""Finding it too shameful to continue, she fell silent and just looked at me worriedly.Chapter 4I forced a weak smile. ""Shelly, could you fetch the first aid kit for me?""Soon, familiar footsteps rang out outside the door.Damian was back.His conversation with Shelly reached my ears.""What's with the first aid kit?"" he asked.""Mrs. Caldwell was in the chapel all night. She fell to the floor, and her knees are bleeding.""""Is she that fragile?""Obviously, Damian was suspicious that Shelly and I joined hands to win his sympathy.Bracing herself, Shelly said, ""Ms. Sutton picked on Mrs. Caldwell. She wouldn't let Mrs. Caldwell sit or rest.""Damian's tone turned cold. ""Who gave her permission to do that?""Shelly braced herself and asked back, ""Wasn't it you?""What followed was a moment of silence. Then Damian said in a cold tone, leaving no room for refusal, ""Patricia, go to Finance tomorrow to get your final check. You're fired.""After hanging up, he walked into my room with the first aid kit.He sat by the bed, keeping a straight face.Then he held my ankles and rested my calves on his thigh.""This is gonna hurt. Bear with it.""His gaze darkened as he stared at the dried blood on my knees. Then he took out a few iodine swabs and gently disinfected my wounds.Those photos had shattered every last bit of hope I held for him. Otherwise, that focused expression of his would have once made me believe I was staring at the Damian from the past-the one who had loved me so deeply.But he was with Eleanor all night last night.Over the past three years, maybe they had already spent countless nights together under the guise of his so-called business trips.The mere thought made my stomach churn. I immediately pulled away my legs and sat away from him, disinfecting my wounds by myself.A sharp pain shot through me, reminding me my time with Damian had come to an end.Not looking into his eyes, I lowered my head and applied gauze to my knees while saying, ""Damian, let's get a divorce.""It was a decision I made after a night of agonizing thought, one so painful it felt like I was cutting away a piece of myself. However, Damian didn't even arch his eyebrow after hearing this.His cold, handsome face remained expressionless. ""A divorce? Could you bear to leave me?""His reaction made sense. After all, I'd known him since the Whitmore family took me in when I was five. From that moment on, I became his shadow, following him everywhere he went.He looked at me with disdain. ""I know you said this out of spite. But once is enough. Be careful what you wish for-what if I say yes the next time?""Enduring the great bitterness in my heart, I asked him sarcastically, ""You already have a daughter with another woman. What makes you think I wouldn't leave you?""Squinting, he studied me in a scrutinizing gaze. ""You knew?""I pulled out a bitter smile, my voice nasal. ""Your daughter is, what, three years old or so, isn't she? In other words, Eleanor gave birth shortly after our baby passed away. Right?""Damian's icy eyes flickered for a second. He didn't admit it, nor did he deny it.The silence was almost oppressive.After a long time, he frowned. ""Does Maureen's existence bother you that much?""What a ridiculous question.I smiled feebly, ""No, if her existence is just to satisfy your desire to be called 'Daddy'.""Suddenly, he walked over to me, braced his hands on my sides, and trapped me in his arms.I tried to push him away, but I was so weak that he barely moved.He leaned even closer, his usually cold voice now strangely captivating. In a low, intimate whisper, he breathed into my ear, ""And yet, I love it more than anyone when you call me 'Daddy'.""Chapter 5I blushed at once.Before his health regimen took over, our time in bed was just as passionate as any normal couple's.Sometimes, things had gone so wild that he'd force me to call him ""Daddy"".Now that I thought about it, I regretted it so much that I wished I could vanish into thin air.My heated cheeks obviously satisfied Damian a lot. He smiled, ""It seems you haven't forgotten a bit.""I bit my lip, overwhelmed by shame.But as I looked at his familiar yet foreign face, a sense of release struck me.I said exceptionally calmly and slowly, ""Damian, we can never go back. Whatever happened between us, our paths will never cross again.""A strange look flickered across his handsome face.He straightened up, no longer trapping me in his embrace. Rather, he looked down at me and said condescendingly, ""Stop playing hard to get. It won't work. Just stick to your role as Mrs. Caldwell.""I could no longer hold back and was about to use the 1.5 million dollars as leverage to negotiate with him.Presumably, that would be enough to let him know I was serious about divorcing him.""Damian, sign the divorce papers, and we'll part ways amicably. Or I'll...""His phone rang before I could continue.He answered and said in a gentle tone, ""Yes, I'm at home. Alright.""After hanging up, he said to me, ""Your parents are on their way.""My words stuck in my throat.To be more precise, they were my adoptive parents, but they'd always thought of me as their own daughter.I decided to discuss divorce with Damian after they left.Or things would be awkward when they came here.Noticing my silence, Damian no longer said a word and went to the chapel.I entered the kitchen to prepare lunch together with Shelly.\*\*\*My adoptive parents, Helena Whitmore and Alexander Whitmore, arrived at noon.""Dad, Mom, hello. Take a seat while I set the table.""I forced a smile, pretending everything was fine.Seeing that I was limping, Helena asked with concern, ""What happened to your legs?""Not wanting them to notice anything wrong, I stuck out my tongue and said casually, ""I fell.""Alexander shook his head. ""Aurora, you're not a little girl anymore. When can you learn to be more careful? Did you go to the hospital?""""Yes. The doctor said there was nothing serious,"" I immediately said perfunctorily.Looking around, Helena asked, ""Where's Damian?""My face stiffened a little at the mention of his name. ""He's in the chapel. I'll go get him.""But Alexander quickly stopped me and said a bit carefully, ""No. We'll wait.""Detecting his humble tone, I couldn't help but feel bitter.Though the Whitmore family and the Caldwell family went way back, Walter Whitmore, Alexander and Helena's son, wasn't cut out for business. His poor management led to the steady decline of the family's fortunes, resulting in their recent fall from the elite class of Calverton.On the contrary, since Damian took over the Caldwell family business, the Caldwell Group had skyrocketed. He went on a merger spree, vastly expanding the family's business empire.Over the years, without the Caldwell Group's support, the Whitmore Group would have been crushed by its opponents already.This explained why Alexander and Helena now treaded so carefully-even obsequiously-around Damian.Though they were his elders, they treated him with a deference that did not befit their status.Perhaps it was because I upset him today. It had been almost two hours since my parents' arrival, and I had sent Shelly to urge him, but he was still in the chapel.It made me wonder if he was deliberately keeping them waiting.Sensing something, Helena said worriedly, ""Aurora, I saw the news yesterday about Eleanor's bankroller. The photo... It didn't show his face, but the silhouette looked like Damian to me. Was it ... him?""Chapter 6My heart skipped a beat, and my nose twitched. Tears welled up in my eyes.Just then, Shelly rushed into the living room. ""Mr. Caldwell's here.""Damian's arrival cut short Helena mid-sentence.He was as refined and polite as ever, yet an innate condescension laced his tone. ""My apologies for keeping you waiting, Alexander, Helena.""I secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Thankfully, he didn't give them the cold shoulder and spared them the embarrassment.""No need to apologize. We just got here and were chatting with Aurora.""If you're busy, go ahead. Don't mind us,"" Helena said with a smile.I lowered my head. ""Let's go, Mom. Lunch is ready.""Damian sat at the head of the table.My parents and I were seated to his right and left.Alexander carefully glanced at him, hesitant to speak.""Damian... Can I ask a favor? I...""Everything-from his tone to his attitude-suggested cringe.Damian said flatly, ""I know the Whitmore Group has been facing some difficulties. You don't need to sweat about the funds. Did you bring the contract?""Alexander quickly nodded. ""Yes, I did.""Damian said, ""I'll sign it later, and Aurora will mail it to you tomorrow. The funds will be transferred to the Whitmore Group by this Friday at the latest.""Alexander and Helena obviously seemed a lot relieved.They smiled and kept thanking him with the look of a great weight being lifted from their shoulders.""Aurora is my wife. It's only right that I give the Whitmore family a hand when necessary.""Hearing this, Helena was no longer worried.She had always been the straightforward type, not a fan of beating around the bush.""It's such a relief to see how in love you and Aurora are,"" she said with a smile. ""You know what? I saw a photo of Eleanor's bankroller on the news yesterday, and I was so sure it was you. Can you believe it? I was so worried I barely slept a wink last night.""Both Damian and I instantly went stiff, and I quickly changed the subject.After Alexander and Helena left, I slipped the drafted divorce agreement onto the last page of the contract and brought it to the study.\*\*\*In the study, Damian was in front of the computer, dealing with work emails.The warm yellow light accentuated his chiseled facial outline, reminding me how much I'd loved watching him in rapt attention.I sighed softly and placed the contract in front of him, ""This is the contract from my dad. If you have a moment, could you sign it now?""He glanced at me, obviously satisfied with my obedient demeanor. He said with a smile, ""It turns out you do know when to stop.""""Yes. Thank you for helping my family,"" I said, suppressing the bitterness deep down.Before signing the contract, he said, ""Oh, and one more thing. With all the paparazzi lately, I'm thinking of bringing Eleanor and Maureen to stay here for a while. Eaststone Heights is the most secure gated community in town, so it'd be safer for them.""A sense of suffocation overwhelmed me.I actually forgot that Damian was a shrewd businessman.Every gift from him came at an equal cost.There was a price tag on the favor he had done for my family.I nodded. ""Alright.""He continued, ""They can take the master bedroom. It'll be better for Maureen...""""You don't have to explain. I get it,"" I interrupted him. ""I'll move to the guest bedroom.""Even my husband no longer belonged to me. Why would I give a damn about a bedroom?Then I pushed the contract closer to him and urged, ""Can you sign it now? My dad's waiting.""He signed it without saying another word.As time ticked away, I grew more and more nervous.The last page was the divorce agreement I'd prepared.Chapter 7Luckily, Damian trusted me, at least a little.He lifted the corner of every page and signed his name in all the required places without even reading the contract.I felt a wave of complete relief once he had signed the divorce agreement.Not wanting any surprises, I took the contract away the moment he capped his pen.Back in the master bedroom, I took out the signed divorce agreement and hid it in a book.The cooling-off period was a month.\*\*\*That very night, I was ready to move out of the master bedroom.When he entered and saw me limping and packing, he stopped me.""Leave it with Shelly and the others.""His tone was relatively gentle. ""Once all this paparazzi trouble dies down, Maureen and Eleanor will move out, and you can move back here.""Don't worry. They won't stay here for long.""I scoffed while glancing at the serious look on his face, ""Gee, I can't tell you how grateful I am. Thank you for your kindness.""His expression turned cold right away.Since I was only moving to the guest bedroom, I didn't pack much.Apart from some skincare products and clothes, the most important item was an urn kept on top of the wardrobe.I didn't ask for anyone's help. Instead, I stood on a chair and carefully brought the urn down.The little girl in the photo was the apple of Damian's eye, and what was inside this urn was my most precious treasure.But unlike other children, mine was denied a carefree life. She'd stay in this urn forever, never feeling the warmth of the sunshine.When I retrieved the urn, Damian was on the balcony talking on the phone with his assistant. They were devising a plan to bring Eleanor and Maureen back without alerting the paparazzi.After hanging up, he came back and saw me holding the urn.Frowning with displeasure, he asked, ""Why are you holding this?""His deep-set eyes were tinged with a hint of confusion.Looking at him, I couldn't help but wonder, ""What if my baby hadn't died?""Would Damian still have had an affair?""Would my baby have been the apple of his eye?""But I quickly shook my head to dismiss the thought. It simply wasn't worth consuming myself over a jerk.Saying nothing, I was about to step out. Just then, Damian grabbed my wrist and asked, ""I'm asking you a question. Why are you holding this?""I looked at him coldly and said, ""Because it's the only thing that belongs to me in this house.""Perhaps my words had stirred some last vestige of conscience in Damian. He gradually loosened his grip.I moved to the guest bedroom, placed the urn in the safest spot, and stared at it for a long, long time...The next noon, Eleanor and Maureen were taken back to the villa.Shelly had just made lunch. Though the table was filled with exquisite dishes, everything was vegetarian.Eleanor and Maureen were obviously not used to it. But to please Damian, Eleanor pretended that she loved the food. She even went from coaxing to coercing Maureen into eating it.I couldn't help but scoff inwardly. So much for the so-called A-list celebrity.It was such a relief that she wasn't my idol.After tasting several dishes, Damian set down his fork and asked Shelly with a frown, ""Were the ingredients flown in today? The bread tastes different, too.""Shelly glanced at me helplessly before explaining to him, ""Mrs. Caldwell used to do all the cooking, including baking the bread. She always mixed the ingredients to her exact proportions and followed her specific recipe. She's not feeling well today, so I baked the bread. Though I managed to mimic its appearance, I couldn't recreate the flavor.""It never occurred to Damian that the food would taste so different with another person cooking.Chapter 8He stared at me for a long time, his gaze meaningful, but I still didn't offer to take over the cooking again.After all, who'd waste her time and effort taking care of a man that was never hers?Damian was too proud and high-and-mighty to ask me to keep cooking vegetarian food for him.But he was also a picky eater. He called his assistant and ordered, ""Find me a cook who excels at vegetarian cuisine. Money isn't an issue. I want to have them start tomorrow.""Eleanor had appeared timid and quiet throughout the whole time.She finally spoke up, ""Ms. Whitmore, I know you're upset with me. It's a bit inappropriate for me to take Maureen to move in like this...""I interrupted her and said flatly, ""Oh? So, you do know how inappropriate it is. Yet you still shamelessly moved in anyway. Is there really no other place for you in this world besides my home with Damian? It seems you can't live without wrecking someone else's marriage, Eleanor.""Her expression changed a few times at my harsh words. She instinctively wanted to retort, but she held it back and just looked at Damian through tears.I was the only one who saw her clenched fists under the table.Though Maureen was just a little girl, she sensed the hostility in my tone.Scared, she ran toward Damian, sat on his lap, and asked timidly, ""Daddy, who is she? She's so mean.""""Don't be afraid, Maureen. She ... isn't a bad person.""Damian shot me a warning glance. But with Eleanor's presence, he didn't snap at me.Perhaps he felt a bit guilty. After all, he brazenly took Eleanor and Maureen back into our home right under my nose, and I behaved so ""cooperatively"", not making a scene at all.That was why he didn't dare push his luck further. Could he really expect me to not only accept them but also welcome them with a smile?Failing to sow discord, Eleanor obviously was displeased. She couldn't even continue to pretend her interest in the table full of vegetarian food.I couldn't help but sneer inwardly.It had been three years since Damian became a vegan, and I, who used to be a total meat-lover, had followed his diet for three years as well.Now that Eleanor wanted to snatch him away, she couldn't even make such a small sacrifice?I was full. I set down my fork and left the table under their gazes, mixed with different emotions.Back at the guest bedroom, I took a deep breath and looked around at the place where I had lived for almost four years now.Only guests stayed in the guest bedroom, right? A guest-that was exactly what I was now.Since I didn't sleep at all last night, I wanted to take a nap. Just then, someone knocked on the door.I opened it and saw Eleanor standing outside.With a big bag in her hand, she said, ""Sorry, Ms. Whitmore. It's your wedding photo with Dami in the bag. He didn't want Maureen to see it, so I'll have to trouble you to put it away.""""Don't bother. Toss it into the trash,"" I said deadpan.Then I was about to close the door.Failing to rile me up, Eleanor wasn't going to give up just like that.She quickly held the door frame and said softly, ""Ms. Whitmore, Maureen is a secret between Dami and me. We ... have our reasons. You really don't have to be so upset. Once Maureen and I leave, you can still hang the photo back up.""A secret?She made it sound like they were the victims, and I was the villain who stood in their way.Not bothering to waste my time on her, I grabbed the bag and tossed it onto the floor.Chapter 9The glass frame inside the bag shattered. Hearing the sound, Eleanor instinctively looked at me. Not spotting any sadness or regret, she seemed stunned.Perhaps to her, I was a bitter woman who was dumped by my husband.I was supposed to crouch on the floor, crying miserably while holding the glass shards.I glanced at the bag sideways before saying, ""The photo's now taken care of. Is that all? What else do you want me to put away? Perhaps the bed in the master bedroom that I shared with Damian?""Eleanor was rendered speechless, her delicate features almost twisting with anger.I slammed the door shut in her face.Then I placed the bag by the door, not even bothering to take a look at the wedding photo inside.I'd have Shelly throw it away later.After waking up from my nap, I started scrolling through Instagram.Just then, a profile picture caught my eye.It was Maureen's photo.Obviously, it was Eleanor's account.I knew I should've ignored it.But, driven by impulse, I clicked on it anyway.Eleanor was surely an A-list star, fiercely protective of her privacy. There wasn't a single photo of her with Damian and Maureen-not even a solo shot of herself.Yet, the faces of Damian and Maureen were crystal clear. For every milestone and celebration, there was a whole collection of photos, each accompanied by thoughtful captions.When I was pregnant, I spent a lot of time fantasizing about Damian being a father.The cruel irony was that it was his mistress who ended up bringing that fantasy to life.I kept scrolling, wanting to know when his affair had begun.My finger hovered mid-air as I saw a specific date.It wasn't the day he first betrayed me, but it was the most devastating day of my life.I remembered clearly. At the end of the year before last, my mother's condition suddenly worsened.Having already been in a vegetative state, she suffered multiple organ failure overnight, her life hanging by a thread.The doctor told me a newly developed type of medical device could completely replace her blood while providing cardiac and respiratory support. If applied in time, it might save the day.As it turned out, the device was developed by the Caldwell Group.It hadn't hit the market at that time and could only be obtained through internal channels.I had thought getting the device would be easy-peasy for Damian.But after I told him about it on the phone, he said, ""Tell the doctor to treat her at all costs. Money isn't an issue. I got an urgent business matter to attend to, so I gotta go.""He hung up without waiting for my reply.But making money was the easiest thing in the world for Damian.I suppose I was like his money in that way-he came by both of us so easily that he never learned to hold either dear.Till today, I still remembered how desperate I was after he hung up. What could possibly be more important than my mother's life?It wasn't until now that I knew his so-called ""urgent business matter"" was taking Maureen to the amusement park.While I was desperate and alone in Calverton, he was in the largest amusement park in Dreswick with his mistress and illegitimate daughter.Later, Walter managed to obtain the device, saving my mother's life.But I'd never shake the despair or the terror of losing her any second.Suppressing the white-hot rage and gut-wrenching pain, I quickly turned on my laptop, took screenshots of Eleanor's Instagram posts, and saved the photos.Everything she'd ever used to provoke me would be the proof I used to confront Damian in court.Staring at the photos, I suddenly remembered Damian saying yesterday that the leaked photos had come from Polaris Media, the company I worked at.Chapter 10How was that possible?I was the editor-in-chief. No content could be published without my authorization.Had Damian made a mistake? Or someone in my department had done something behind my back?Just then, someone knocked on the door.Damian pushed it open and entered before I could respond.He tossed his phone onto the bed in front of me, demanding, ""How long are you gonna keep this up?""Puzzled, I picked up the phone, only to discover that a new set of photos of Eleanor had been leaked-again.Just like before, there was nothing but a blurry silhouette of Damian.Compared to the photos, the repeated leaks themselves were the bigger problem-they felt ill-intentioned.I looked at him and said in a barely audible voice, ""It wasn't me. Could you trust me for once?""Suddenly, Maureen ran into the room, her face smeared with tears. ""Daddy, Mommy's leaving! Please stop her!""Damian's expression instantly became grim. He picked her up and hurried out.I followed him to the living room, wanting to clarify things with him.He was trying to stop Eleanor from leaving.Meanwhile, Maureen grabbed Eleanor's hand, begging her not to leave while crying pitifully.I stood aside in silence, watching the family of three.Netizens always dismissed Eleanor as nothing but a pretty face, claiming even a block of wood would out-act her.But, from what I witnessed, she had great acting skills-she burst into tears so easily, with her eyes reddening and her voice trembling to perfection.""Dami, let me go. I really can't stand it anymore,"" she said, tears streaming down her face, ""If this goes on, it's only a matter of time before my reputation is down the drain.""Before Damian could say anything, I ridiculed with a cold smile, ""Says the mistress who moves into the other's house with her illegitimate daughter.""""Aurora, shut up!"" Damian snapped.Then he turned to Eleanor, his tone softening. ""I'll handle this. You can't leave. Maureen needs you.""Maureen was genuinely terrified that Eleanor would leave just like this. She said through tears, ""Mommy, if you're really going to leave, take Daddy and me with you. OK?""Pointing at me, she said with a pout, ""She's so mean. I don't want to stay with her.""Eleanor scooped Maureen up, tears rolling down her cheeks. ""Sweetie, I don't wanna leave you. But...""I looked at Damian and said flatly, ""No one has to leave. Get a lawyer to come here to inventory our marital assets tomorrow. I'll take what's mine and leave. Then your baby girl won't be frightened any longer.""Damian was driven to the corner. Besides, both Eleanor and Maureen clearly didn't want to see me here. I figured he'd agree at once now that I offered to leave.To my surprise, he said firmly, his gaze darkening, ""You're not going anywhere before I get to the bottom of this.""I was a bit disappointed, but apparently, Eleanor was even more so.Of course, she wasn't serious about leaving.

1nd5m67,https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/1nd5m67/end_credit_song_ranking_from_worst_to_best/,End credit song ranking. From worst to best. (Strictly in my opinion!),"So a while back, I made a list that was consisting of the many end credit songs throughout different forms of media of Middle-earth. I decided to make an updated list, this time with newer additions. Even spanning from a video game inspired by Tolkien lore. Now, chances are there is a song that I am missing. But I believe that I have listened to and ranked all of the ending songs that stick out the most. Also, the list consists of songs with lyrics, so instrumentals do not count. Also, I can‚Äôt stretch this enough. Allow me to place this crucial bit in all caps. Hopefully to ensure that there are no other loose ends to tie. Anyways, as said in the title, this order in which these songs stand in, ARE JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION! Odds are, there is a song on my list that‚Äôs your favorite or least favorite. So fill free to let me know, but please be civil about it. I don‚Äôt want to start any arguments, or step on too many toes as I already am. Another thing, the songs throughout are from three different forms of media. Films, video games, and TV. Yeah. I know, it‚Äôs taboo to talk about ‚Äúyou know what,‚Äù but when we get there, just hear me out. This list will also be going from worst to best. Again, in terms of preference. So, here we go. Oh! Before I forget! Another note, I do know that there are many writers who had a hand with the song. I‚Äôm merely focusing on the artists who sing them, but I will bring up the writers in most if not all of the entries. Alright, with that addressed, let‚Äôs begin. 


12. The Ballad of Damrod: by Jens Kidman. Now, if there is one thing that Ring of Power does right, from the very start, it‚Äôs the music. Bear McCreary has a very vast grasp on what makes great Middle-earth music. Doesn‚Äôt help that prior to his inclusion, he was also the composer of both the new God of War games. Not to mention we get the Legendary Howard Shore to compose the opening theme. I tend to listen to the soundtracks often when I am just sitting at home relaxing, or doing other activities like cleaning the house. Obviously, I listen more of Howard Shore‚Äôs masterpieces from all six films, but Bear is among the library as well. Unfortunately not all of Bear‚Äôs works are a hit. 
I‚Äôve talked about this one in the past, that while I do like the music itself, I can‚Äôt say for the vocals. I love some rock, I can even like heavy rock. But not when the singer sounds like he is getting over a sickness! The singer sounds like he has throat cancer or something! When a rock song does that type of vocalization, I check out. It‚Äôs fine if it‚Äôs done for a little while, just not the whole thing. Which is a shame, because the song starts out really well, and seeing as Professor Tolkien has been a huge inspiration for rock and roll as a whole, you‚Äôd think doing a rock song featuring Middle-earth would be genius! Which it is, but what matters is the execution. For me, the execution just isn‚Äôt there. 

11. Gollum‚Äôs Song: by Emiliana Torrini. Oh boy. I just know I‚Äôm pissing someone off. But truth be told, out of the 6 live action films, this was always my least favorite. I don‚Äôt know why. I mean, the orchestral score by Howard is chilling, beautiful even. The vocals of Torrini are haunting, and hypnotic even. Fran Walsh does a fantastic job in writing the song, but for some reason, this is the one I listen to the least; film credit songs that is. I‚Äôve spent years wondering why that was, and I still don‚Äôt have a definitive answer to that! Maybe because when I first heard the song, I watched the music video, and remembered being confused on what the song was about. Yeah. Imagine, but I was like seven, so cut me some slack. Also the fact that I would constantly listen to the number one song many times(no spoilers just yet,) Gollum‚Äôs Song just felt inferior in comparison. But, I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get the definitive answer to this, and maybe, it‚Äôs best if I didn‚Äôt. Keep in mind, I‚Äôm not saying that this is a bad song! Far from it! But compared to the other five songs from the saga, this one just isn‚Äôt my cup of tea. 

10. Fires of War: by Kelli Schaefer. The newest placement in my list, and it comes from the sequel to one of my all-time favorite games. Shadow of War was, and still is, a very odd game for me. Like, it does a lot of questionable stuff when it comes to the writing and the lore, sexy Shelob is the prime example of that. As someone who played through and adores Shadow of Mordor, I will say that I was disappointed that that game didn‚Äôt have a credit song, that wasn‚Äôt mainly orchestral. But after playing through Shadow of War, when I heard the ending song, I was both amazed, and glad that the minor nitpick was fixed. Now, truth be told, I haven‚Äôt listened to it that much, heck, Gollum‚Äôs Song got more plays. But I have to say, out of the two, though despite not listening to as often as the other songs, it just fits more at home with me. Maybe because it‚Äôs my love for the first game, and my satisfaction of finishing the second one, completing Talion‚Äôs story, maybe it‚Äôs the vocals of Kelli, or the lyrics and music written and composed by Nathan Grigg. I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it. If I were to give an answer, it would be a mix of both. As said, I love the first game to death, even though like any game, there are admittedly parts that piss me off,(not as much as Shadow of War though,) so hearing the lyrics with the score that reflect the struggles of Talion just resonated with me more. 

9. I See Fire: by Ed Sheeran.
I love Ed Sheeran. The very first song recall hearing of him was I See Fire. That very first time came from that fateful Christmas Day when I went to see The Desolation of Smaug with my Dad as a present. Got the tickets in a Gandalf bookmark too! Needless to say, that was a great Christmas for me! So when the credits started rolling and the song played, I wanted to listen to the whole thing, but my Dad just wanted to go home. So I went home and listened to it on YouTube. Since then, it is a go-to song for me whenever I am out and about. With that said, I See Fire kind of sticks out. What I mean is that the other songs have a certain feel to them, like they‚Äôre in a uniform which reflects that they are songs meant to represent the Tolkien universe, while Ed‚Äôs still does this just fine, I feel it does it less than the others. Even Gollum‚Äôs Song did that better, admittedly. But then again, maybe that‚Äôs why I like it so much. Because with sticks out. Regardless, it helped introduce me to a man with great talent, and I honestly, wouldn‚Äôt change that for the all the gold in the world. 

8. This Wandering Day: by Janet Roddick. Now, I wasn‚Äôt going to include this in my list, as it was featured in the Rings of Power episode, Partings. As Poppy would sing it throughout the Journey. But that changed when a user showed me that another singer had sang it during the end credits. Obviously the singer was better in the end, but Poppy‚Äôs actress(whose name escapes me,) did fine for what she was given. Oddly, this was one of the few times in Season One where it felt like it was a proper welcome back to Middle-earth. What makes it even more shocking was that it was written by J.D. Payne, one of the showrunners. One of the few times that Tolkien had a small chance shined through in his writing, and, he actually did a decent job. While not perfect, I do find myself listening to either version. Even more so with the cover by Colm McGuiness, and his duet with Jax the Bard. That one I have listened to many times over. They have such great voices, and I highly recommend that you give it a listen to. But with that said, This Wandering Day, a shining moment from a Tolkien adaptation that‚Ä¶well, is incredibly flawed. To put it in the nicest way I can. I know a lot of people here hate it, but personally, I just find it, meh. But even so, I still choose to just listen to the soundtracks. Those will always be a treat to me. Still, not near the majesty of Howard, but still good. 

7. The Rider: by Paris Paloma.
This one I have been wanting to listen to for a while. Finally got around to last week. When I was sitting down at my local bookstore, and just enjoying my day. Writing down notes, and taking in the atmosphere. There‚Äôs a little space you can sit in and rest by a fake fireplace, while reading a book, or just drinking some coffee. Anyway, I‚Äôm getting off track. I saw that the Rider was on the list on YouTube, and since I have been looking to listen to it, basically since War of the Rohirrim came out, I decided to give it a go. I‚Äôm very glad I did. The vocals of Paris really do feel as though one of Rohan was singing. The music itself is nice. As all Middle-earth music would naturally be. Phoebe Gittins and David Long did a good job as writers for the song. The only real thing is that holds it back for me, is that I really need to listen to it more for it to really stick with me. Also doesn‚Äôt help that I still need to watch the film, which I look to fix this coming Tolkien week. So maybe in the future, this song will reach higher onto my list. But will it reach the top five? Personally no. Because I love those songs way more, as they hold deeper to me, not to mention that the very four in question have remained firm in their place for years. Frankly, I don‚Äôt think that will chance. Number 5, well, time will have to be the judge. 

6. Where The Shadows Lie: by Fiona Apple. 
You know, when I first watched Season one of ROP, I kept saying to myself after like the first episode, ‚ÄúThis is supposed to be a Lord of the Rings show, right?‚Äù All I was getting was that it was trying to be‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶whatever it was trying to be. Wheels of Time? Maybe the Witcher? I don‚Äôt know. But aside from a few moments where it did shine through that this was meant to be an adaptation of Tolkien‚Äôs work, I felt lost many other times. But as soon as the last episode played, and Sauron returns to Mordor, and the Three Rings are made, the credits roll, and then it starts to feel like Lord of the Rings! All thanks to the ending song, sung by Fiona Apple. Who did a nice rendition of the One Ring Poem. I can‚Äôt complain about the lyrics of the song, because it‚Äôs word from word the poem written by Professor Tolkien! So the lyrics are solid. The music, once more by Bear, is chilling, foreboding, and a signal for the worst events in the Second Age are about to begin. Fiona brings a performance that is decently reflecting that. Once again, the music comes to the rescue for the show, this time, Tolkien‚Äôs lyrics are a skeletal structure. 

5. Old Tom Bombadil: by Rufus Wainwright.
Season two, was definitely an improvement over Season 1. My Dad and I watched it when it came out and we both found it to be more enjoyable; as it felt more like Lord of the Rings, compared to whatever Season 1 was trying to be. I feel that it was really a case of missing identity. While the identity for season isn‚Äôt all there, I can at least say that it was a more fitting welcome back to Middle-earth. Although, it was still riddled with issues. Some I‚Äôd rather NOT talk about, due to disgust, and stupidity. If you know, you know. But I digress, the first thing I did in preparation to Season two was listen to the music. When I heard that Tom Bombadil was finally getting adapted in another form that wasn‚Äôt a video game, and after over twenty years of images of what could have been in the Peter Jackson films, I was intrigued. Not excited, or angry, just intrigued. Then I looked up Tom Bombadil online to see if any new information was out, and I saw the song on YouTube. I clicked on it, and learned that singer Rufus Wainwright was singing it. I must admit, he was an actual good fit to sing a song written by Tolkien. Though the lyrics were combined from other songs that Tom sung in the books, I didn‚Äôt mind. Because I just loved hearing Rufus‚Äô voice, and to hear more of Tolkien‚Äôs lyrics sung, was always a treat. I have to say, out of all of the songs that ROP released with lyrics, Old Tom Bombadil is the one I visit the most. Because I just love the lyrics, because of course, the music, once more by McCreary who just kills it, and Wainwright‚Äôs singing, as I used to love Hallelujah as a kid. So yeah. This is the ROP song I‚Äôve heard the most, and in my opinion, the best of the four. 

4. Song of the Lonely Mountain(film version): by Neil Finn. 
It was in April of 2013, it was a rainy day, and both me and my Dad were at home. He comes to my room and asks me if I wanted to rent a movie from Redbox, so we go to Wal-Mart, and we find that The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was available to rent. We missed out on seeing it that previous year, so I immediately jumped at the chance to rent it. In the end, my dad and I watched it twice that night. A wonderful welcome back to the land of Middle-earth. Not to mention, this was officially where I wanted to read the books. I found a copy of The Hobbit at a further Wal-Mart, bought it, and I was hooked. As of today, The Hobbit is the only novel I have ever read twice! That is another reason why I hold An Unexpected Journey close to my heart. It was a mix of fond memories of my past, making new ones with my father, and it helped me become a bigger fan of Professor Tolkien‚Äôs mythology. It also inspired me to create my own fantasy worlds. But that‚Äôs a topic for another day. Back to the song. I actually heard it through when I watched the film with my granny one day when I went to spend the day with her. Long story. So as the credits rolled, I sat in silence, and listened to the song. Since then, Song of the Lonely Mountain became the end credit song of Middle-earth that has been replayed on my music lists for years. Second to only my number one favorite. I love Neil‚Äôs vocals, the background vocals, which I‚Äôve heard were done by his sons,(which makes it even better in my opinion)the music once more done by Howard Shore, the fact that it matches the same melody as Misty Mountains Cold in the film(one of my favorite parts by the way,)and the lyrics. Now, I mainly speak of the film version.‚Äôfor the soundtrack has this echo when Neil sings, and it doesn‚Äôt have that orchestral beginning like in the credits. I don‚Äôt think have much to complain about aside from the difference in versions. Nothing more to say, just that I adore the song, but I love the top three just a bit more. But hey! Still the second most listened song of the list. That‚Äôs still something to be proud of. 

3. Into The West: by Annie Lennox. 
Ah. Annie Lennox. I adore her voice. From Sweet Dreams, Here Comes the Rain Again, and Love Song for a Vampire. She has such an amazing talent, and is on my list as being one of my favorite singers. When I learned that it was she who sung Into The West, I have to be honest, being a kid, I never put it together. But as I got older, and learned it was her, I listened to the song once more, like actually listened to it, and like her other works of art, I was enchanted. There is no wonder as to why this song one the Oscar for best song back in 2004. All in thanks to the writing talent of Annie, and the lovely Fran Walsh, as well as the music composed by Howard. Used throughout sections of such a masterpiece of cinema, yes. Now, while not my number one favorite song, I still love it, and personally, it was really close for the last three. For Annie, I was just listening to it over and over last week. I don‚Äôt think I have anything bad to say about the song. It‚Äôs a masterpiece, through and through. 

2. The Last Goodbye: by Billy Boyd. 
It‚Äôs Billy Boyd! Pippin, who sings the song to close out the saga! Like, come on! Billy has already shown he has a great voice in Return of the King, so of course it only made sense to give him a full length song! It also helps that he helped Fran and Philippa write it! I had to stop myself from leaving the theater when my Dad and I went to see The Battle of the Five Armies that very year. It was going to be another Christmas present, but neither Mom and Dad knew if they would be able to get tickets for Christmas Day. But when I was watching the credits, and I heard the song, I literally murmured to myself, ‚ÄúPippin.‚Äù Of course the thought was correct as moments later after the cast was shown, it showed that Billy Boyd was indeed singing. As I went home, I went to YouTube, found the music video, and was in tears, not only did it have Billy singing like an angel once more, but the video played clips from all six of the films. Locations, characters, behind the scenes moments from the crew, and when it ended with Billy singing, ‚ÄúI bid you all, a very fond farewell,‚Äù no lie, I teared up. To so many, like myself, this felt like it was indeed the last goodbye, and we could close that very chapter in our lives. Seems silly to think of it like this now, but back then, this truly felt like the very end of Middle-earth. So for the past two years, as I would allow the end credit songs to play, I also like to add The Last Goodbye music video to my watch list, as a way to say goodbye to Middle-earth, until next time. To me, it just makes my marathon a little more special, and I intend to do so again this year! Oh, I can‚Äôt wait! Tolkien week Can‚Äôt get there sooner!! 

1. May It Be: by Enya. 
The gold standard to what songs of Middle-earth should be. Or at least in my honest to Eru opinion. Let me go back to last and unlock a memory of my childhood. When I was a kid, wee boy, my older sister and I were talking to ourselves after watching the Lord of the stings for what felt like the thousandth time. So, we decide rondo something different. We went to the second disc of the Fellowship of the Ring DVD, and found the bonus features, we found the music video of May It Be, I was immediately in love with such a magical song. From the lyrics, the melody, and of course Enya‚Äôs unworldly voice which lifted my very spirit. Which for a six year old child, this was rare. Out of all the credit songs, this is the one I listened to the most, the one that captured my heart, and became what I feel all of the songs should strive to be. It just clicks all of the boxes for me. Not to mention the fact that I believe this is where my love for Celtic and New-Age singers began to blossom. But I digress. Beautifully written by Enya herself, with additional aid from Roma Ryan to boot! Like Into the West, this song is just flawless, at least in my opinion. It‚Äôs a freaking masterpiece and it really should have won the Oscar as well. Randy Newman, nothing personal, but If I didn‚Äôt Have You was no where near an Oscar worthy song in comparison to May It Be. But I digress, another thing I used to do is listen to it before I went to sleep when I uploaded it to my mp3 player, many years later. It is such a soothing piece that can make anyone dream such wonderful things. It also soothes my anger whenever something gets me riled. Like, I swear they use this song in therapy sessions. Another thing that makes this song so great, is that it has great covers. One specifically is an acapella piece performed by Peter Hollens, with the addition violin by Taylor Davis. If I‚Äôm not listening to Enya‚Äôs rendition, the Peter is there is enchanting me with his own great talent. I highly recommend you check that cover out if you haven‚Äôt already. It‚Äôs a masterpiece in its own right. Especially at the second chorus. That is my favorite part of that performance. Another thing I nearly forgot to add was complementing Nick Ryan for composing the song, and of course, our dear Howard Shore for conducting it with the London Philharmonic Orchestra of all things. That is truly the cherry on top of such a beautiful cake that shall live on for years to come. 

So, there we have it! All of the Middle-earth related credit songs from worst to best, in my opinion. What are your favorite or least favorite songs? Let me know, and remember, this is just my personal opinion. So please do not take any of this post to heart. I merely wanted to share another thing I love about the world of Tolkien. Also, if you do decide to reply, please don‚Äôt be a jerk about it. I just want to have a nice conversation free from any drama and chaos. With that said, comment below, and let me know.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

# Cybersecurity Isn‚Äôt Just for the Experts

Picture this: you‚Äôre sipping coffee, scrolling through emails, and one message looks legit enough to click. A few seconds later, your device is compromised. For many beginners, that‚Äôs how cyber threats strike‚Äîquietly and unexpectedly.

The truth is, you don‚Äôt need to be a seasoned hacker or a Fortune 500 security analyst to take control of your digital safety. What you *do* need is a mindset to [**stay ahead of threats**](https://www.sprintzeal.com/blog/proactive-risk-management-guide) instead of constantly reacting to them. This beginner‚Äôs guide will walk you through the basics, without overwhelming jargon, so you can feel confident in your ability to protect yourself and your organization.

# Why Staying Ahead of Threats Matters More Than Ever

Cybersecurity isn‚Äôt static‚Äîit‚Äôs a race. Threat actors evolve their tactics daily, while businesses and individuals scramble to catch up. Waiting until an attack happens is like installing a lock only after your house has been robbed.

By learning how to **stay ahead of threats**, you‚Äôre not just minimizing risks‚Äîyou‚Äôre building resilience. Whether you‚Äôre an IT student, a small business owner, or someone curious about tech, proactive security makes all the difference.

# Step 1: Understand the Common Threats

Before you can defend yourself, you need to know what you‚Äôre up against. Some of the most common cyber threats include:

* **Phishing emails**: deceptive messages that trick you into revealing sensitive information.  
* **Ransomware attacks**: malicious software that locks your files until you pay a ransom.  
* **Weak passwords**: easily guessed or reused credentials across multiple accounts.  
* **Unpatched software**: outdated systems with known vulnerabilities.  

Understanding these basics helps you recognize red flags early and react quickly.

# Step 2: Build Strong Cyber Hygiene Habits

Think of cyber hygiene like brushing your teeth‚Äîsimple steps done consistently prevent big problems later. To **stay ahead of threats**, start with these habits:

* Use **unique, strong passwords** and a password manager.  
* Turn on **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** wherever possible.  
* Keep your devices and apps **updated** to patch security flaws.  
* Back up important files regularly, both locally and in the cloud.  

These actions may sound simple, but they create a strong first line of defense that stops most attacks in their tracks.

# Step 3: Stay Informed and Aware

Cybersecurity isn‚Äôt something you learn once and forget. New scams and vulnerabilities appear almost daily. To **stay ahead of threats**, make it part of your routine to:

* Follow cybersecurity blogs or newsletters.  
* Join online communities where IT professionals share updates.  
* Take beginner-friendly courses to strengthen your understanding.  

Even setting aside 10 minutes a week to read about the latest risks can keep you prepared for emerging challenges.

# Step 4: Make Security a Shared Responsibility

If you‚Äôre part of a team, remember that cybersecurity isn‚Äôt just the [**IT department‚Äôs**](https://www.sprintzeal.com/) problem. One careless click can put an entire organization at risk. Encourage open conversations about threats, share best practices, and create a culture where everyone feels responsible for keeping systems safe.

When everyone works together to **stay ahead of threats**, the burden doesn‚Äôt fall on one person‚Äîit becomes a shared shield.

# Conclusion: Your First Step Toward Cyber Resilience

Cybersecurity may sound intimidating, but it starts with small, consistent actions. By learning the basics, practicing good habits, and staying informed, you‚Äôre already taking steps to **stay ahead of threats**.

Think of this as the beginning of your journey‚Äînot a finish line. Whether you want to pursue a career in IT or simply protect your digital life, the key is to stay curious, stay proactive, and remember: the best security breach is the one that never happens.

Today‚Äôs my friend Adam‚Äôs Saturday at the local zoo in Alpaxter City. It was a simple job, but I liked joining him whenever he invited me. Apart from the fact that I‚Äôd probably work for no pay and contract a disease from the animals there, they¬†--the animals--¬†were the uncanniest thing I‚Äôve ever seen.

¬†

The main reason why most galactic citizens avoid Earth in general is because of how many of their organisms look like us. Slime molds look like the Kijmij,¬†Oyster mushrooms resemble the Belka. Earth has an organism for every species in the galaxy;¬†if you look hard enough. And I don‚Äôt know about you, but personally, seeing myself on four¬†legs and with the intellect of a toddler doesn‚Äôt sound like the most endearing thing.

¬†

So, as much as I say¬†no this time, Adam promises me one thing that I can never say no to. ‚ÄúIf you come, I‚Äôll give you catnip. Enough to last you for a month.‚Äù

¬†

Standing behind the apartment door, he playfully winks at me to come. I don‚Äôt believe him one bit. Humans aren‚Äôt all saints, and this one has made too many empty promises before. ‚ÄúHow the hell do I know you‚Äôre not lying to me? You don‚Äôt even have the cash for something like that.‚Äù

¬†

Still sitting on my couch, I turn the page of my cookbook, ignoring him.

¬†

Reading a custard recipe,¬†I hear¬†a soft jingle chimes from his pocket. Looking up, he‚Äôs holding a small green bag with a yellow bell. My ears perk up at it, and Adam smirks. ‚ÄúWell, Tibs. Does this convince you? Your government doesn‚Äôt like this stuff around its¬†borders, so I reckon supply‚Äôs pretty low. The zoo trip will be fun; I‚Äôve got a new idea to try out at the big cats' exhibit. You‚Äôll love it. Swear.‚Äù

¬†

As he twirls that treat with his fingers, a sweat bead goes down my fur. I need that. But damnit, I know it‚Äôs not worth it. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice and all. But not a month like you said. Hard pass.‚Äù I try to read again, but to my dismay, Adam grins this time.

¬†

God, what‚Äôs going on in that mind of his that could convince me to come?

¬†

15 minutes later

¬†

I find myself standing in a navy blue helper uniform, on some cold tiles that make my paws hurt. My eyes are tinted orange from their usual amber, like I‚Äôve been crying. But I wasn‚Äôt. Instead, I was high. Back in the apartment, Adam pulled out a second bag and tore it, tossing the nip to me. Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt dodge in time, and it went up my nose.

¬†

I‚Äôm still pissed about it, too. The bastard tied me down after my eyes dilated, and drove me here¬†while I was tasting green. Jackass. Speaking of which, a yell comes from the corner. ‚ÄúTibs! Get over here, we have to feed the lions!‚Äù From the short hallway, he gestures for me to come over, and I reluctantly¬†do so.

¬†

But¬†approaching a familiar¬†ledge, I stop¬†in my tracks, heart pounding. I make sure to hide behind it, hoping it doesn‚Äôt see me. Oh God‚Ä¶are they there? Peeping past the column, there‚Äôs a large jungle environment. Scanning, so far there‚Äôs nothing, until the tree. In it, there‚Äôs a pattern of rosette spots arching on a branch. As it pounces from the tree, into the lake, I almost jump back in fear.

¬†

Fuck, it‚Äôs the jaguar. Why couldn‚Äôt it have gone out for medical tests again? Of all the big cats, this one I cringe at the most, because it looks like me. Tail, teeth, claws, fur. It‚Äôs just on 4 legs¬†and kills everything. I may sound like I‚Äôm overreacting, but imagine seeing a human with feet for hands? Not even that, this bitch doesn‚Äôt like me. She growls, spits, and tries to break the glass every time I pass by. And now she‚Äôs swimming in the water.

¬†

Luckily, she hasn‚Äôt seen me. I can just sneak out of here, get to the control, and watch my phone while Adam works. He can‚Äôt complain if I‚Äôm watching security. Turning around, I tip paw to the second corridor. Moving forward, I freeze hearing Adam bellow again. ‚ÄúTibs! Come on, I need you by the storage room!‚Äù

¬†

Having been loud enough, the Jaguar finally hears my name. Immediately, it laser focuses on the ledge I was at and begins bashing its claws against the glass. Why, Adam, why? Growling, it lets out a roar that,¬†In its guttural threats, sounds like: ‚Äúooouutt‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†

I almost freak out, darting for any hallway that would take me to Adam without passing the glass. And there‚Äôs none. That cat‚Äôs my only choice. I grip my head, pulling down my fur. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know why she hates me! I‚Äôve never done anything, we barely interact!‚Äù There‚Äôs no point in being subtle.

¬†

‚ÄúTibs!!! Stop being a puss! Zyra‚Äôs gonna start laughing at you if you keep hiding.¬†The surprise, remember!‚Äù

¬†

Begrudgingly¬†I¬†turn around and¬†take a deep breath. ‚ÄúSurprise my ass.¬†Make it fast.‚Äù Stepping forward, the tile creaks slightly, now coming into full view. I begin to sprint down the hallway, holding my hat down. Her claws¬†almost break the glass, but she holds herself back.

¬†

I don‚Äôt focus on that detail, panting and rushing to the white door at the end. Doubling over, though, I hit my knees as sweat drips down. She‚Äôs out of sight¬†now. ‚Äúhuff huff. I need to start exercising.‚Äù

¬†

Catching my breath, that doorknob looks very labour-intensive. This surprise is ass. I should‚Äôve just bought my weed. Cheaper too. Coming out to yell at me again, Adam opens the door. ‚ÄúTibs -- Oh, you‚Äôre here. Come on, it‚Äôs inside. And what happened to you?‚Äù

¬†

In response, I purse my lips and spit on his shoes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a dick. Before I walk in, tell me what the surprise is. I‚Äôm not doing anything else until.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúFine, you baby. The surprise is a new translator I got for Zyra and all the other jaguars. You‚Äôll get to see what she thinks.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWHAT!!‚Äù I yell. ‚ÄúWhat is wrong with you? What made you think I wanted this!?‚Äù I tighten my paws, glaring at him. My mind stays sharp despite the haze of fatigue. ‚ÄúHow blind are you!? She mauled me last time we went into their exhibit to feed her!¬†What makes you think I want to see her again?‚Äù

¬†

I still remember the way she bit my ankles and dragged me through the grass. Thank God I didn‚Äôt get hurt. Adam just laughed at me. My best friend, right?

¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you mean you hate her? She loves you. That incident was her trying to show you her new son. If she wanted you dead, you would be dead. They‚Äôre cute when you know them better. Hence this. She‚Äôs waiting for you right now.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI don't give a fuck. I'm no dad. I‚Äôm leaving, tell her I said goodbye. And if you can, give her your middle finger; I can‚Äôt.‚Äù

¬†

Straightening my back, I turn around. Walking away, Adam doesn‚Äôt try to stop me. Weird, like he wasn‚Äôt the one who got me high to come here. ¬†Expected more resistance. Continuing down the hallway, a loud growl then purrs from behind me.

¬†

There‚Äôs no‚Ä¶yes, it is. With those glass panes in sight, Zyra‚Äôs not in the water. Immediately, I start running again,¬†in a panic. But the next moment, I hit the ground, hard. I‚Äôm pinned. A heavy grunt leaves my lungs as all the air‚Äôs forced out, thanks to the bone-bending weight on my back. ‚ÄúYou crazy cat! How the hell did you even get in there!?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúCrazy? Rude for a first greeting. My mental faculties are fine. Prick. There‚Äôs an employee‚Äôs gate they use as a shortcut to that office. If you‚Äôre not that dumb.‚Äù Almost as punishment, her paws kneed my back, digging deep into my shirt. By the door, Adam‚Äôs laughing his ass off. ‚ÄúSweetheart, just like I said!‚Äù

¬†

His finger wipes a tear off his cheek before going into the office. Seeing him in the corner of my eye, I panic. ‚ÄúWait! Help me!‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be fine. I‚Äôll be with the others. You 2 get to know each other, not like you‚Äôve spent enough time together.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù

¬†

He walks off without even checking his back. A soft vibration shoots down as she starts chuckling. ‚ÄúIt was so funny,‚Äù¬†she started easing off my back. ‚ÄúYou know, next time, don‚Äôt run.‚Äù Fully getting off my back, she prowls back.

¬†

As I start scheming on escaping, a sudden pressure clamps down on my ankle. ‚ÄúNot again!‚Äù Before I can kick her off, she starts dragging me at full pace. On the floor, looking up, there‚Äôs a smirk tugging her lips, with my foot in it nonetheless. I desperately try dodging the trash can on our way, but my head is knocked into the metal casing.

¬†

I groan and grab my head, trying to protect it. Sliding into the office, it‚Äôs no better, bookshelves fall on me¬†as she crashes into some drawers. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost there.‚Äù She speaks.

¬†

A few minutes later, she leaps out of the gate and lands on the grass, practically slamming her body into the grass. When she lets go. I don‚Äôt get up.

¬†

Everything hurts. I think my tail‚Äôs broken. Adam, again the bane of my existence, catches my mangled bruises.

¬†

Feeding 2 other jaguars, his hands drop a strip of meat. While they scrounge for it, he wipes off the blood and approaches me. ‚ÄúHey buddy! Took you too long.‚Äù Adam even kneels to pat me on the back.

¬†

I don‚Äôt respond to him. Tilting my head up again, I spit on his shoes before face-planting into the grass again. ‚ÄúI hate you.‚Äù My voice is muffled through the grass, but¬†it‚Äôs enough.

¬†

Wiping that saliva onto the grass, Adam nudges my side with a soft kick. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say that.¬†You‚Äôll love ‚Äòem. Especially when you get to meet¬†Ted.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not getting up. And why do they all have names?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúMe, of course, calling them cat 1 to 3 is robot thinking. There‚Äôs a reason why I said you‚Äôd love this.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done everything else but love this. Why should I care about their thoughts? Just let me sleep.‚Äù I stare at the grass, eyes closing. But then another tug pulls my tail. ‚ÄúNo, fuck off! I swear, Adam, I‚Äôll put salt in your coffee!‚Äù

¬†

Ignoring my threats, the pulling continues. INot long after, I‚Äôm infront of the other 2.

¬†

That¬†meat‚Äôs¬†completely devoured, they look at me like they‚Äôre reading a tombstone. The first one speaks. ‚ÄúAdam. What happened to him? He‚Äôs the one Zyra dragged in here, right, what‚Äôs his name?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúTibs.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOkay. Hello Tibs. I‚Äôm Kelly, and the other one next to me is Genoa.

The other, next to her, decides to leave, hearing her name. She doesn‚Äôt bother introducing herself. I scrunch my head, still on the ground, of course. ¬†Despite how creepy they look, the¬†translator‚Ä¶humanizes them.

¬†

Kelly then nears me, sticking a paw out, and she nudges me to see if I‚Äôm alive. I groan in response, and she takes a sigh of relief. ‚ÄúGreat. When are you going to get up?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNever.‚Äù

¬†

A little pur comes out. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Saturday.‚Äù

¬†

The trees in here sway like they‚Äôre agreeing with me. The sunlight enters through the open ceiling, with a very nice, crisp blue in the sky. To think, I missed this day, instead of getting bitten on the ankles. Carried around, like I‚Äôm a cub. Speaking of which, that ‚Äúpuppy‚Äù thing Adam was hyping again.

Probably forgot how to say cub. Idiot.

¬†

From a nearby bush, a twig breaks. Looking up, there‚Äôs a tiny figure crudely hiding behind the leaves. It looks¬†cocky, with its hiding spot. But God is it adorable. This must be the kid he was talking about. Hard to believe this is Zyra‚Äôs.

¬†

And to my surprise, it isn‚Äôt that. The pup, finally ending its stock, jumps out in front of Genoa by the further corner. There‚Äôs a glint in her eyes. She expected it. But she didn‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings, so she jumps.

¬†

‚ÄúI scared you good, mommy!‚Äù He yells, wide-eyed and proud. Putting on a smile, she gets back to her feet, petting him. ‚ÄúYou sure did! Just a bit more practice and you‚Äôll be a star.‚Äù As she somewhat cuddles him, Zyra walks behind them, passing by.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on here?‚Äù She asks.

¬†

‚ÄúOh, Daniel‚Äôs playing lunge. He‚Äôs not very good at it, but he won‚Äôt improve if I don‚Äôt let him try.‚Äù

¬†

Zyra snorts at the answer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pathetic.‚Äù

¬†

Genoa frowns. Covering Daniel‚Äôs ears with her paws, she turns back to her. ‚ÄúWell, at least my son is an actual jaguar.‚Äù

¬†

What the hell? What does she mean by that? After her revelation, there‚Äôs a small pause before Zyra‚Äôs face gets red. Then, from the back, a second figure looms. Golden fur shifts under the scattered light. ‚ÄúMother, is she talking about me?‚Äù From the bush, a damn golden retriever pops up.

¬†

‚ÄúNo, Ted. Go back to practicing your slashes, and I‚Äôll deal with Miss Italian city.‚Äù She replies begrudgingly.

¬†

I would‚Äôve never seen it coming. Suddenly, that puppy line‚Äôs justified, speaking of which, where‚Äôs Adam? He‚Äôd be -- oh, there he is. By the feeding station, grabbing more meat. He saw everything, already coming back to my spot. Stopping before me, he hands Kelly some food.

¬†

Then looks down at me. ‚ÄúSee? I told you it was a surprise.‚Äù He tries to play it off like I should be grateful for this, having hours of my life burnt, when I could‚Äôve seen this on Facebook.

¬†

‚ÄúThis was the absolute worst fucking payoff I‚Äôve ever gotten from you. I‚Äôm spitting in all your food. Look at them.‚Äù We all turn our heads again, but this time, I see Zyra grooming Daniel. His face is relaxed as she licks his fur, trying to get all the knots out.

¬†

You know what, that is cute, way too cute. I search my pockets, wanting to take a picture. Digging into them, I feel the rough remnant of my phone as I pull it out. The screen‚Äôs cracked, and bits of the cover are broken and in blood.

¬†

No wonder my lap hurts so much. As revenge, I swipe at Adam‚Äôs legs. It lands, slow human reflexes. As I take a picture, while he grabs his shin, Zyra sees me from across and realizes what‚Äôs happening. Her face is pissed, but I don‚Äôt care. This is my wallpaper now.¬†At least something for shit giggles out of this.¬†

¬†

As the day went on to pass,¬†I barely moved from my spot. I‚Äôm not free labour, and Zyra tried getting that pic off my phone. But after that, my fear for her was burned. Though that still leaves me questioning why the hell she was so violent to me.

¬†

When I got the chance to ask her this, she kicked me in the back. It hurt like hell, and when I was about to complain, a jingle came from my pocket. To my surprise, I searched and my pocket had Adam‚Äôs other bag of Nip.

¬†

‚ÄúYou smelled intoxicating.‚Äù She replied.

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your lame excuse? Why the hell didn‚Äôt Genoa and Kelly try to kill me?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNot every cat can smell it the same way.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúFuck you,‚Äù I say.

¬†

‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôre competition in my territory, I had no choice. Now stop crying and tear it open, Daniel‚Äôs not here.‚Äù

¬†

I don‚Äôt question it. We crack it open, get a whiff, and for the rest of the day, we don‚Äôt do shit. It‚Äôs a cacophony of shit giggles and dumb debates. Daniel eventually saw this shit, too. He blushed, embarrassed seeing his adopted mom trying to do a backflip, though I‚Äôm pretty sure jaguars can‚Äôt.

¬†

But at least it was a nice ending. So moral of the story: If you ever give your human roommate an inch, they‚Äôll take a mile. Never give in. I spat in his coffee the next day, extra salty too.",5,1757480845.0,HFY,3,0.86,False

A new hire (29F) joined recently, and we clicked quickly. We‚Äôd sit together in the cabin, grab coffee and lunch, and she often initiated dinner or movie plans.

One day, while playing Never Have I Ever in the cabin, she opened up about very personal stuff (including her past engagement/breakup). I also shared a bit. The very next morning, she messaged me saying she realized she had been oversharing and wanted to keep things ‚Äústrictly professional‚Äù going forward.

From that day, she stopped inviting me for coffee/lunch or hanging out casually. I replied that I understood, but later in the evening I reassured her that I didn‚Äôt judge and that it‚Äôs normal for friends to share. She politely thanked me but repeated that she wanted to keep it ‚Äúcolleague mode.‚Äù

I followed up once more asking if I had done or said something to make her uncomfortable. That‚Äôs when her tone got much firmer ‚Äî she said her boundaries may have been misinterpreted, she doesn‚Äôt want further discussion on the matter, and from now on all our interactions should remain strictly work-related.

Since then, she‚Äôs avoided personal interactions completely. She still talks to others normally, posts on Instagram but seems to skip my stories, and at work keeps everything very formal with me.

I‚Äôll be honest: I developed feelings for her. I never confessed them, and I don‚Äôt think I crossed any obvious line, but her sudden pullback has hit me really hard. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep well, I overthink constantly, and I feel like I was encouraged to bond one day only to be shut out the next.

Did I misstep here? Did she maybe sense my crush and that‚Äôs why she distanced herself? Or is this just about her regretting how much she overshared? How do I move forward working with her every day when I feel ignored and discarded?

TL;DR: New colleague (29F) got close to me (28M), opened up about very personal things, then suddenly decided to keep everything professional and cut off our casual friendship. I developed feelings, now I feel discarded and don‚Äôt know if I messed up or if it‚Äôs just her issue.

Edit 1 : The thing is, she‚Äôs not even contacting me for small work-related matters anymore. She‚Äôs new, and she used to ask me doubts about processes, but now she asks someone else. It feels like she‚Äôs ignoring or avoiding me. I heard from my manager that she gave me good performance feedback, mentioning that I helped her a lot and all. That‚Äôs why I feel so wrong about how it just ended ‚Äî it feels very cold. My friends told me she used me because she was new and wanted to build connections, but I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs true; she‚Äôs not like that. I understand that she wants to stay professional, but what‚Äôs bothering me the most is that I don‚Äôt know what I did wrong.",2,1757480759.0,AskIndianWomen,8,0.75,False

A girl from my workplace‚Äîshe‚Äôs Arab, and I‚Äôm Pakistani, born and raised in the UAE. She often used to stare at me, and one day she approached me and asked something. I replied in Arabic, and from then on she started getting closer. Eventually, we exchanged numbers and began chatting. Later, she confessed that she loved me, and I replied, ‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù We went on a small car date, and things stayed okay for the first four months.

After a while, she kept talking to other guys at the workplace, which honestly didn‚Äôt bother me. But she had a problem whenever I talked to a girl‚Äîeven though it was usually just a simple ‚Äúhi‚Äù or ‚Äúhello.‚Äù She would always question me: ‚ÄúWhy did she talk to you?‚Äù It became toxic. We often argued, and I wasn‚Äôt really putting much effort into the relationship. She was always the one to start these conversations and bring them up. After about five months together (June to October), things were already shaky.

Around that time, I met another Pakistani girl‚Äîtall, good-looking, and simple. We were at an exchange, so I approached her and started talking. She was open and friendly from the very first meeting. I offered her Costa Coffee, and she accepted. We talked, and since she had a flight to catch (she was in transit from Pakistan), we kept in touch. Soon, we started talking a lot, and we discovered we had many things in common. The most surprising one? We were born on the exact same day, month, and year.

We began sharing our future plans, and everything matched‚Äîour thoughts, our goals. She‚Äôs studying medicine abroad, and I even visited her and proposed. She accepted, and now our parents also know. She even speaks to my mom. Everything is going well between us. Of course, like in any relationship, she sets boundaries (like no male friends), and she‚Äôs always on calls with me. But we‚Äôve already decided to continue together and marry. It‚Äôs been a year now since we‚Äôve known each other.

Here‚Äôs the problem: the girl from my workplace has suddenly changed. She‚Äôs treating me really well now, cut off her male friends, and keeps saying she wants to quit her job, give up everything, and marry me. She‚Äôs become so nice‚Äîbut I honestly don‚Äôt have any feelings for her. I‚Äôm about to get married soon, and I don‚Äôt know how to tell her that I‚Äôm not interested. The harder part is that we work at the same place, so I‚Äôll be seeing her every day.

Do you have any suggestions on how I can cut things off with her respectfully, without creating too much drama, since I‚Äôm about to marry in the coming months?

1nd5cun,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1nd5cun/dorm_room_demon/,Dorm Room Demon,"That‚Äôs what I call it anyways. This was about 15 years ago. While at University, I majored in Psychology, I love studying how the mind works, and develops. Why we do the things we do and think the things we think? I think there is a rational explanation for everything, sometimes to a fault. I‚Äôd shrug off an intruder in the dead of night if I thought there was a good enough reason for them to be there. Are they in the wrong house? Am I in the wrong house?! I can explain away just about anything‚Ä¶except this. 

One night my roommates and I were chilling with a few other friends over. Just like any other normal college night. Listening to music, playing some card games. Just hanging out having a good time. We were not drinking, we didn‚Äôt smoke. It was not exam time, so stress was at normal levels for a college student trying to balance work, school, and social life. It was a good night! We wrapped things up as we had class in the am, and most everyone went home at a fairly normal hour for us‚Ä¶11? 12? Off to bed I went.

We had a 4 bedroom apartment. We all shared a living room and kitchen and laundry room, but we each had our own room and bathroom. Each bedroom was a perfect square, except the slightest little indentation where the door was, as the closets were built into the square, so it almost made what I will call a little ‚Äòhallway‚Äô or entry nook into the bedroom. We all had a window, and an entry into our own bathrooms. 

My bed was in the corner of the room, next to the window, and across from the door into my bedroom, and sliding closet doors. There was a street lamp that was outside the window that acted almost like a night light? Even with the blinds closed, it always radiated a soft yellow glow in my room. I didn‚Äôt mind it, I always had a clear view of who was coming into my room, even if it was dark. 

So I curl up in my bed, and doze off to sleep. I don‚Äôt remember what time it was, but for some reason, I wake up to this intense feeling that someone is watching me. Not like I woke up terrified, just like ‚ÄòOkay, this is not a drill. Someone is in my room.‚Äô I was asleep facing the corner, away from the door. I am convinced someone is in my room, hiding in the ‚Äònook.‚Äô Like the feeling is palpable. You know when someone is in your personal space. I laid there for a few seconds for two reasons. A.) I was sleeping hard and had drool running up the side of my face, so was embarrassed that I was probably snoring like a machine. B.) It‚Äôs college. If someone is playing a trick on me, I‚Äôm getting them before they get me. An adrenaline rush started to take hold in anticipation. I have my eyes open as wide as I can trying to soak in every last bit of light my eyes can decipher in the dark. I use all of my strength to flip around as fast as possible‚Ä¶if anybody is getting caught off guard it‚Äôs them. 

My heart is officially fluttering. My eyes dart back and forth only to realize‚Ä¶nobody is there. It took a couple of seconds, because the overwhelming feeling of someone in my room was still there, but my eyes were proving otherwise. Just the soft glow of the street lamp outside radiating through my closed blinds. I laid there for a second getting myself together, like‚Ä¶what was that? Nothing? Okay, obviously nothing. My pounding heart beat had retreated a good bit, that euphoric feeling of an adrenaline rush subsided, and I rolled myself back around to face the corner and go back to sleep. 

As I roll over, a dark mist shoots from my bed and up the corner of the wall, before it rolls out across the ceiling before dissipating into nothingness. It was almost like a thick black fog if you will. Like fire smoke that makes waves across a surface. It scared the absolute bejeezus out of me. I don‚Äôt know what it was, but it was dark, and fast, and disappearing. I laid there with the lights on for about an hour before I could fall back asleep. With its disappearance so to was the feeling that someone was in my room. Maybe my eyes were playing a trick on me? Maybe they had not adjusted to the light in the room? Maybe I was delusional? It was there, but it‚Äôs not now, and who knows what it was? I go back to sleep. 

I get up to my alarm in the morning, and as always go to make a coffee and stand in my roommates doorway while she does her make up and listens to music. Just a good ol‚Äô morning schmooze fest. She was not as far along as she usually is, her hair was in a messy bun when she opened her door, and I didn‚Äôt hear her music through the bathroom wall like always when I woke up. (Our rooms shared bathroom walls.) She had her glasses still on, and looks like she had literally just rolled out of bed. We had always talked about religious and spiritual and paranormal stuff before so I was dying to talk to her about my experience, but also thought she would think I had absolutely lost it. I asked her how she slept, already knowing from her demeanor, not very well. She said she didn‚Äôt sleep well, and had a nightmare for the first time that she can remember in a long time. She looked half in tears and said she was not out of bed yet, because she called and talked to her mom about it.

My spidey sense starts tingling and I get goose bumps as she explains that‚Ä¶around the same time I woke up, she woke up from a nightmare involving a ‚Äòdevil‚Äô like ‚Äòcreature‚Äô with horns and a formless presence that ‚Äòfilled up‚Äô the space in her dream like a SMOKE, OR A BLACK FOG that also shielded its face from full view. I dang near dropped because what are the chances that it is a coincidence? After she told me all the details of her dream, I told her about my experience, and we both officially freaked. To this day we have not been able to make sense of what we experienced and I have never seen it again, nor has she. 

Our roommates on the other side of the apartment didn‚Äôt experience anything. ",4,1757480472.0,Paranormal,2,1.0,False

The savage kind that laughs at your cries, and is glad if you died ‚Äì he‚Äôs truly an evil mad hatter by design
He‚Äôs a business man living on an island hosting five hundred and five ‚Äì so everyone knows his havoc ways
But setting foot on that airplane that had been delayed ‚Äì they wouldn't know - what would happen that day..

Arthur had arrived on the plane with a smug on his face ‚Äì all because his private departure was late
He sat on the back seat - opposite of where the flight attendant should be ‚Äì so she‚Äôd have to walk back and forth through the lane
‚ÄúIs my coffee ready yet‚Äù!? He yelled across the plane in disdain ‚Äì not caring about the dismay of the lady who served him
‚ÄúComing right away sir‚Äù ‚Äì she said with pain in her words ‚Äì wishing he wouldn't treat her like a slave or a servant!

5 Hours have passed since Arthur has been on the plane ‚Äì now he's drinking champagne and writing down notes
But not for his job ‚Äì No ‚Äì he‚Äôs writing down quotes ‚Äì so his arsenal of mass verbal weaponry grows
‚ÄúThe people of my island are all idiots ‚Äì so after this trip ‚Äì I'll leave with my riches and give nothing to them‚Äù
Well maybe the mayor ‚Äì I‚Äôll leave him a prayer ‚Äì where he turns to vapors or chokes on his phlegm!‚Äù

Suddenly while writing ‚Äì Arthur hears a loud noise ‚Äì which falters his poise - and sends him in distress
‚ÄúWhat was that sound, you better tell me right now, land this plane on the ground!!‚Äù - Arthur yells very upset!
Next thing you know ‚Äì the engine combusts into flames - This must be the reason the flight was delayed!
(Pilot) ‚ÄúBrace for impact ‚Äì we are going to crash - God I haven‚Äôt been bad - save me with your grace!!!!‚Äù

*CRASH*

The plane crashes face first on a deserted island ‚Äì killing the flight attendant - and pilot in the cockpit
But out of the rubble comes Arthur ‚Äì injured and noxious ‚Äì glad that he's survived this violent process
‚ÄúThat was a close call, but my left arm is fractured ‚Äì and my forehead is bleeding faster and faster
I must find a medical kit ‚Äì for tissue and making a splint ‚Äì he quickly thinks looking at the disaster

Scouting the plane ‚Äì Arthur finds the supplies he needs to survive ‚Äì and nurtures himself back to good health
‚ÄúWhere am I exactly‚Äù? He says to himself ‚Äì I better find a radio and call for some help
Yet he finds nothing but debris and ash from the plane, so he tries to call from his cellular phone
But there‚Äôs no signal in these vast parts unknown, as he looks around to realize‚Ä¶he‚Äôs alone

Finally...

""Finally! I'm free from every human being!"" Arthur screams ecstatically while running on white sand
""I'm free from all imbeciles, simpletons, and infidels"" - he screams following a maniacal laugh
But as soon as Arthur's celebration is finished - he realizes just what that really means
It means that as long as he's stuck on this desolate island - not a single soul will ever be seen!

This can't be...

""This can't be!"" Arthur cries in denial - ""It's only me on this island? That I just can't believe!""
He scours day and night for someone alive ‚Äì passing through vines and coconut leaves
Finding no-one ‚Äì he shades himself with a tree to hide from the blistering sun - and sits idly on a stone
Looking deep into the Ocean with his mind Trapped in a zone - he wishes that he was - safely back home

5 months pass and Arthur is running out of of hope - he doesn't want to live here - melancholic and broke
For being alone had damaged his soul - but changed him into an actual human being with a pulse
""I'm sorry - I just want to go home"" he says everyday - "" I promise I'll never have hate or anger displayed""
As he walks devil's sand with a coconut in his hand - he begins to kneel down and give God his praise..

That's it...

""That's it""! As Arthur finishes praying - his mind sparks revelation - so he gets up and sprints towards the plane
Looking in a craze - he finds the tools he was rummaging for - a pen, paper and empty bottle of champagne!
But instead of merely writing ""help"" on the note - he writes an atonement for everyone on his island - even the Mayor he hated the most
""I'm sorry everyone for my hateful - disgraceful - frivolous quotes - especially you - The Mayor Of My Home!""

Signed, Arthur

And so the bottle is sent out to sea - a bottle atoned - going where the crashing waves take it
Till 5 months later it washes up on a Beach - intact with the note - not broken nor tainted
It's picked up by a man in a suit - who was looking at fish - but the sparkling bottle he couldn't resist!
He opens and reads it - then says while balling a fist - ""Wait till' everyone on the island hears about this!""

You're forgiven, Arthur.

Andrew James Flores, with a message from the Lord...

The God of Israel is righteous and blameless; he has placed and secured a safe time for the ages
His pious is sacred, for he has been The God of man; since the beginning of time was created
His word is worth infinity, one with the bible, having the world; yearned with serenity
He is everything man is seen; creating the land and seas, and having the earth birthed with divinity.

The Land:

The land is bright green; the golden sun shines on it with care and prosper
The land‚Äôs flowers bloom, and plants take their state; inhaling the air and water
The great trees stand tall; as the beautiful animals are kissing his plan
Everything is serene; in the state of the fling, as God plants seeds of bliss on the land.

The Sea:

The sea is bright blue, the golden sun shimmers on the waters with splendor
The sea‚Äôs wonders are such vast; it diminishes fire; if it‚Äôs caught in an ember
The ocean‚Äôs carry sea animals in loving joy; for the happiness and glee of father
The sea is great, as a meaning offered; for water without salt, is drinking water.

Man:

The Genesis: Adam and Eve were created by God; human beings from his hand
They are people of his reign; blossomed from the seeds of the land
Everything is splendid, and beautiful, as everything harbors a reason
Everyone is sacred, humans, and animals; in the Garden of Eden.

Animals:

The animals, sacred and one; living from the sea and land
Lions and whales, they accompany us graciously, as they provide the glee of man
Man lives in unity with them; as they have a pious will
We sear the sheep for lines of silk, and grab the goats; providing milk.

Heaven:

Heaven; a golden sun shimmers splendidly with joy, on each building and person
This is where gracious people go, one‚Äôs with faith for God; the afterlife for mortals; if you‚Äôre worthy in worship.
Angels fly with fortitude for God; giving blessings to everyone they see
People pray passionately; as this is where everyone‚Äôs in eternal peace.

Hell:

Hell; a fiery place; where the golden sun doesn‚Äôt shine; for there is already flame
This is where sinners belong; as the devil torments and tortures you in the deadliest way
Demons taunt and count your days; as you wonder when all the burning will cease
Yet you must know; that this is where all sinners; burn for eternity.

Paradise:

Paradise; a wonderful place; where everything and everyone is happy and magnificent
This is where people who lived joyous lives belong; yet didn‚Äôt know God; but still they were embellishing.
Everyone is safe and secure; as they look at a golden sun and, empyrean sky
Everyone and everything prospers together; this is paradise.

Purgatory:

Purgatory, a place where the golden sun is cast; it is neutral in strength
For this is where people who lived normal lives go; doesn‚Äôt matter if it was for God or for them; they enjoyed their length
They know they have to follow the rules; and keep looking at the blaring skies
For they can follow God‚Äôs rule, and go to Heaven or paradise.

Andrew James Flores:

I am Andrew James Flores; poet and, philosopher; always filled with happiness and joy
It is my fulfillment to write for God; and help secure his word, and magnificent voice
That is his plan for me; to prosper in every way, and to hold the golden sun
For he has made me a pious semi-god; and valuable chosen son.

The Ending:

The God of Israel came to me long ago; seeking someone to spread his word
I have done so, through my writing‚Äôs and the church; and he has my essence firm
In return he has anointed me Semi-God; to reign on the earth in splendor
I am going to teach everyone with my bible; and they will have scripture to remember.

Armageddon:

Armageddon; a fiery war will run its course; between good and evil; heaven and hell
Angels will fight demons on earth; and you will be an essence who dwells
Everything will change; as God‚Äôs army abolishes sin
It is coming close; and heaven will prosper; as everyone proceeds with the godliest men.

God; pious with divinity; Andrew James Flores; pious with divinity; we are both the same as you can tell; caught in ripples
He has made everything; I will make the future; we are both interchangeable; yet never mistake our identities; for I am Andrew James Flores; as-well as....

The God of Israel.

‚ÄúYou are lost in the depths of darkness; this desolate valley is an endless margin
Only you again - can become light‚Äôs presented target, or end up a leper‚Äôs carcass.
Broaden your horizons over the horizon, and seek The Lord as your saving grace
For your life is precious, embrace your lake; only then can you change your fate‚Äù

The Black Moon, suddenly disappeared, for I'd dissipated my fear, and the magnificent horizon had never looked more clear
I followed it for miles on end, it was pleasantly revered ‚Äì yet one of my footnotes were not too sincere.
For I decided near my heart‚Äôs lake to write poems against my God ‚Äì and there was no doubt, his descendants saw
So The Black Moon descended again; a method called, and the beautiful horizon might as well been a sent mirage.

Many serene white moons have passed; where I've seen the Black Moon; descend in my slumber
How I wished for the horizon, or maybe I should have prayed - to have it by the end of the summer
I want to ascend from rubble - my heart's lake quenches holy waters from the heavens
Yet my soul refuses to quit-infusing with sin - denying the help from a church or a reverend.

Yes, I didn't turn to a Methodist, or turn to a Methodist - to repent for my sins
Instead I dabbled in sex, fighting, and alcoholism, all coming from the hellish depths of within'
I continued to write blasphemous poems near my heart's lake, while watching skeletons subside in the surface
Maybe it was time I realized scrutinizing is worthless, and lived with the intent of finding a purpose.

Living with the intent of finding a purpose to live, what are the gifts - that journey will give?
Will it be a serpent that slithers in the crevice of rifts, or holy water for extinguishing the hell's fire - burning my crypt.
I see the ghastly Black Moon, hover over my heart's lake, and the whistling wind is trapping my breath
Maybe one day, I'll see the beautiful horizon again, glistening over this valley of death.

Many serene white moons have passed, and the Black Moon descended over my self
The sky was starless, maybe it was meant for me - as a phoenix from ash arose for my health
Devilish memories flooded the lake of my heart; as demons appeared out of dirt from the valley
Even he himself; Satan in the flesh, waited for my breath - for he felt I deserved a finale!

Yes, I am freighted of my demons and devil(s), but I must face them - face to face
For I know with you, Lord - and the savior's flame, I will have a saving grace.

Seraphim's response:

We've heard your cry, thy bless'ed son - the tides of your heart's lake have rendered much
May you follow the magnificent horizon, ascend and such - and feel The Lord's tender touch.
Your dreams beckon, reach out for the valley of death to prosper, passed the clouds and tests of somber
For you are one with Heaven's father, and with him - evil, will be forever conquered.",1,1757480307.0,u_Due-Caterpillar3962,0,1.0,False

She's the cutest and best kid ever-- autistic and learning language slowly, but very social and inquisitive.  Kinda big and strong for a girl so young, too.  I take her to church and try to keep her in the toys-and-books area (too little for Sunday School as yet) and keep her entertained and non-disruptive, and it's hard.  Other parishioners' reactions to her sometimes trying to run around and make noise vary, from extremely supportive to a bit cold.  Our Deacon said he really feels kids in church should be fully free-range, like at the church he grew up in.  Not everyone agrees with him.  So, I try to let her play as much as I can and only intervene if I think I really have to.  I make sure she gets a reasonably sized treat at coffee hour as a reward.  I still worry she's not liking it so far.  One time recently, we all went outside after service for an observance, and when I tried to then bring her back inside for coffee hour, she got upset, sat down on the steps and yelled ""ALL DONE"" and waved at the church and yelled ""BYE-BYE.""  Her tolerance for boring adult stuff had reached its limit, even if there was going to be a muffin involved.  I was kinda happy she was able to express herself with words so well, but it also made me worry.  Should I even be bringing her?

1nd59yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nd59yh/i_want_you/,I WANT YOU,"My close friend Austin passed away a few weeks ago. I found him at my place, or rather, at our place. Austin and I were college friends. We were actually living in a dorm, but after Austin and I became close, we decided to move into a separate apartment. We rented this apartment. It wasn't very big, but it was enough for the two of us.

We easily managed most things by sharing the work. Ironing, cooking, grocery shopping... That day, it was my turn to go to the market. I went out for shopping around 7 pm. Not long after, about an hour and a half later, when I returned home, I saw a scene that will be etched in my memory for the rest of my life.

Austin was in the living room. The living room was in shambles, everything was broken and scattered.  The full-length mirror was shattered. Austin was lying in the broken glass. His eyes were open, his hands and arms covered in cuts, blood flowing from his throat forming a small pool on the side, and strangest of all, there was a bloody mask next to him. It was a baby's face, with protruding cheeks and forehead, exaggerated eyelashes, and a grin covering half of the face. I actually noticed the mask after the police and ambulance arrived at the scene. Because the whole time I was focused on trying to bring my friend back to life. Austin was already dead when I arrived. That's why he was taken out of the house in a body bag. God... I collapsed onto the couch. Two hours earlier, we were joking around with each other. Now he was in a black bag and I was... a man left in a void.

It was definitely murder, so the house was now a crime scene. I was homeless. Luckily, my grandparents had a summer house in the same city as my university, and I moved there temporarily.

When my parents heard about what happened, they were very worried about me. I wanted to continue going to school, but my mom insisted that I see a psychologist and even made an appointment for me. I didn't say much during the first few sessions because I didn't think it would help. So what changed my mind? The visions that started two weeks ago.

My grandfather's house is detached and huge. Also, I haven't uncovered most of the items, so it can be scary at night. One night, I went downstairs from the upper floor to the kitchen to get some water. When I turned my head to the left on the stairs, I saw him. He was about my height, a rather overweight man wearing a bloody butcher's apron. His chin was visible under the mask. And yes, it was that mask. The mask next to Austin. I climbed a few steps up the stairs and hid. I thought about calling the police. Then, when I turned my head to look again... he was gone. Still, I called the police to come check my house, but they found no one. And I'm sure they thought I was crazy as they left. The thing is... at that moment, I felt that way too.

When I told the psychologist about it, he said I was having delusions. The human brain can see hallucinations after such ‚Äòtraumatic‚Äô events. But it kept going. Sometimes it would walk past me while I was having breakfast in the kitchen. I would freeze in shock. Then I would get up to check, and he wasn't there. At first, it was so terrifying it kept me awake all night, but over time I convinced myself it was just my imagination. At least, I tried to. But it kept getting worse. There were moments when the killer, whom I had only seen wandering around, would stop and stare at me, sometimes following me. And then the voices started. While I was in the shower, I heard a knock on my door. A few taps. Then it stopped. And believe me, no matter how much the soap stung my eyes, I didn't even blink during the entire shower. It's all in your head, Caleb, calm down. These aren't real. I kept trying to calm myself down like that.

One night, I woke up with a sudden jolt. I was drenched in sweat. Because I was... tied to the bed. It wasn't just an illusion. Even though I pulled on the ropes, my arms and legs wouldn't move. I only noticed the man in the baby mask when he moved. He took a step toward me. Even if I screamed, my neighbor probably wouldn't hear me because the house was detached. With every second he slowly approached me, I struggled and trembled more. He positioned himself right at my head and, unbelievably... he touched me. When his hand grabbed my chin, I froze. He was holding me tightly. He was turning my head from side to side. Then he lifted my head and leaned over me. This isn't a nightmare, I said to myself. This isn't a nightmare. I could smell the dry blood on the mask. He leaned close to my ear as if to whisper, and then... I don't remember what happened next.

When I woke up, it was morning. My hands were free, and the man in the baby mask was gone. Still, I woke up feeling like I'd been beaten up that morning. I didn't see anything else all day. In the evening, I decided to leave the house for a walk. As I walked along the sidewalk in front of the house, I saw our neighbor Julia a few blocks away. I remembered her from a few summers ago. I had met her when we visited my grandfather, and we hung out together. She greeted me. I greeted her back. She asked why I had come here. I told her what had happened to my friend, without going into detail. While I was talking, she suggested we keep walking. I agreed, and we started touring the neighborhood together. I must admit, I hadn't had a normal conversation with anyone in a long time, and while talking to Julia, I realized how much I missed it. We walked together until it got dark. Then she went to her house and I went to mine. Before leaving, I said we should do this again. She agreed. Talking to her was even better than seeing a psychologist. So much so that the hallucinations began to subside to the point where I no longer needed medication.

Julia and I would meet outside and go for coffee. We talked about our hobbies. For example, she was studying at the conservatory. She told me about her dreams of becoming a musician. I played the guitar too, but obviously I wasn't as skilled as her. As I did things with her, I stopped going to my psychologist appointments. I was getting better. And also... I don't know. Julia filled not only the visions but also the void left by Austin. She had literally become my savior.

Once, she invited me to her family's house for dinner. Her family were sweet people, just like her. The warm family atmosphere... it was like a dream. It was something I had been looking for for a very long time. Since my university was in a different city from my family, I could only see them during the holidays. Julia and her family had filled that void for me. So I decided to invite her over. One night, she came to my house to watch a movie. With the lights off and a bowl of popcorn in our hands, we started a 3.5-hour action movie. Halfway through the movie, I paused it so Julia could go to the bathroom. When she came back a few minutes later, she had something in her hand.

‚ÄúWhere did you find that?‚Äù

I had actually forgotten it even existed. It was my grandfather's old guitar. Julia smiled at me. Then she took the guitar and sat down.

‚ÄúWould you like to listen to a few songs?‚Äù

She might have been one of the most talented musicians I've ever seen in my life. Her normal speaking voice was beautiful, but when she sang, it took on a divine beauty. She became one with the song. I thought she would be a very successful artist in the future.

As I listened to her, spellbound, the sound of my phone broke the harmony of the moment. It was an unknown number. When I answered, a woman addressed me by my last name. She told me to come to the police station immediately.

‚ÄúWhat's it about?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe've found a new lead concerning your friend Austin's murder.‚Äù

My blood ran cold. Julia could tell from the look on my face that something was wrong. I told her I'd be there in a few minutes and hung up.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

He leaned his guitar against the couch. I told him I had to go to the station and explained why.

‚ÄìIf you want to go home, I can drop you off.

‚ÄìNo problem, if it won't take long, I'll wait for you here. Besides, the movie's only halfway through.

The offer sounded tempting. I told him I'd be home in an hour at most and went outside.

How could I have known...

When I got to the police station, a police officer greeted me. We went to one of the interrogation rooms. It annoyed me that no one was explaining what was going on. Finally, when we sat down at a table, one of the police officers spoke.

‚ÄìCaleb, we didn't want to call you back here, but there's been a major development.

‚ÄìWhat is it?

He handed me a note hesitantly.

‚ÄìDo you recognize this handwriting?

The note looked like it had been torn from a notebook. And it definitely hadn't been written with a normal pen.

‚ÄìThis... What's that on it?

‚ÄìBlood. A note written in Austin's blood. It was just found at home.

I looked at the note again.

‚ÄìCaleb, will you answer the question?

‚ÄìNo, I don't recognize it.

‚ÄìWell, did Austin have any enemies who would do this?

‚ÄìYou already asked me that.

‚ÄìI know, but maybe after this new detail, someone will come to mind.‚Äù

No one. No one came to mind. Austin had always been a somewhat introverted and polite kid. I was sure no one would kill him so brutally. When the police realized they wouldn't get anything out of me, they let me go.

I want you.

The words written on the little note. All night long, it was as if someone was screaming this inside my head.

I want you.

The police thought the note was written for Austin. But what if it wasn't?

I was a mess. I literally couldn't think. I was walking around in a daze, my head completely empty. I was like a zombie. All I wanted to do was go home and sleep. So I was going to tell Julia I was too tired and we could continue the movie another night. I called her. But she didn't answer her phone. I had called when I left the police station, and she hadn't answered then either. I figured she had already gone home since I was late, and I didn't think much of it.

When I was about 100 meters from home, my neighbor's voice made me turn my head that way. Mrs. Susan was walking her dog. When she called my name, the empty street echoed. She asked how I was doing. I gave short answers so as not to prolong the conversation and kept walking. But she stopped me again.

‚ÄúCaleb, I want to warn you about something.‚Äù Or rather, I want you to warn someone about something.""

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour friend.‚Äù

I thought she was talking about Julia, but I was confused.

‚ÄúWhat? Which friend?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe one walking around with that mask, for God's sake. Please tell him not to walk around with that damn thing. It's scaring my dog, Dexter.‚Äù

I couldn't respond.

I just froze there. Mrs. Susan said goodbye and left. I realized I was shivering even though it was warm. Hallucinations... Were they real? Only one name came to mind. Julia. She wasn't answering her phone. She... She was alone in the house with the killer. I ran home. I opened the door so hard I almost broke it. I shouted Julia's name throughout the house. I was afraid to find her dead in the house, but worse, she was gone. Julia had vanished into thin air. The house was just as I had left it. The only difference was that guitar, which she had leaned against the chair, had fallen to the floor. There was a note next to the guitar. This time it was a note written in pen.

I want you.

I called the police. The police searched the entire house and neighborhood. There were no signs of a struggle, no signs of forced entry, and no blood. So no one could figure out exactly what had happened.

Since I was involved in both a missing person case and a murder case, they took me into custody. But it was certain and proven that I was in a different place from the scene of the crime in both cases. So they let me go. Still, Julia's family blames me. I blame myself too. For leaving her alone at home.

I left the summer house and checked into a hotel. My mom and dad insist I come stay with them, but I won't go. Because I'm scared. More for them than for myself. This killer isn't a delusion; he's hurting people around me. I'm afraid he'll do something to my family too.

I checked into a boarding house. I hadn't been there a day. I fell asleep without even taking off my clothes, exhausted. I woke up to the sound of the door at night. Someone was trying to force my door open at the cheap boarding house where I was staying. I jumped out of bed in a panic, but there was nowhere to hide in the one-room place. As I ran to the bathroom and locked the door, I heard the sound of the main door lock being broken. I could hear his footsteps. He was walking around the room. I even heard him throw a few things.

My phone was left outside. There was nothing here I could use to defend myself. I was writhing helplessly inside the room. Then the footsteps stopped. There was no sound for a long time. It was as if time had stopped. Until a piece of paper slid under the bathroom door. I was startled by the sound of friction. I stared in horror at the randomly torn piece of paper. It had a single sentence written on it in capital letters.

Been meaning to post this up, as I've seen it do the rounds on here for a few months - so why not, suss it out myself. Picked this up a couple of weeks ago. I still got the all in one **frosted oranges and white label Skittlez flower** for review, I'll do them next.

**Quick overview:** 

**Indica or sativa?:** Hybrid flower ‚úÖ  
  
**THC:** 23%  
  
**CBD:** <1%  
  
Terps: Limonene, Beta-Caryophyllene, Farnesene, Linalool (**Total Terpenes:** 3.08%)  
  
**Price:** 10g glass jar $159 RRP  
  
**Grower:** Avant Farms   
  
**Batch #:** EC-0001

Let's start with the **appearance**, the epresso candy nugs pop right away, no question about it. The buds are nicely trimmed and dry, peek the purple highlights :D .

**The Aroma** is decent, don't expect anything ""loud"", however it was enough. Its definitely more on the ""earthy"" side of things with some lemon or citrus smells coming through. 

The **Flavour & Experience** is more earthy, like coffee and bits of lemon, I really enjoyed vaping this one! The beauty of this flower is that it can either be enjoyed during the day, or the evening. I felt sedated and physically relaxed for 2-3 hours after my J and vape.

It's a well-balanced hybrid flower, with a decent terp profile, the aroma wasn't as strong as expected, which is sometimes nice tbh - its not overwhelming. 

regardless it all blended in perfectly.

Appearance: 4/5 

Aroma: 3/5

I want a real conversation about what actually works in findom, psychologically and practically. I‚Äôm curious how you experience the difference between long term ownership and the send and disappear style. I will describe both, then I want blunt answers.

Long term owned sub
This is the one who treats my presence like oxygen. He checks in every morning and every night. He asks permission before purchases. He funds my coffee, lunch, and dinner without reminders. He keeps a weekly tribute schedule and sends receipts. He texts during work to confirm obedience tasks. He journals triggers and weaknesses so I can use them. He accepts discipline, praise, and silence when I choose. He budgets for me first. When payday hits he already knows the split. He smells like my perfume because he keeps the sample I told him to buy. He hears my voice when he opens his wallet. He thinks, breathes, and moves with me in mind. That is ownership. Not just his money. His mind.

Distant tribute sub
This is the one who shows up at 2 a.m. with a random amount and a shaking confession. He wants humiliation or to be ignored. He sends, deletes the thread, and vanishes for a few days. He craves the spike of shame and relief. Sometimes he asks for consensual risk-play themes like ignore, exposure fantasy, or controlled embarrassment. It is hot, fast, and transactional. No routine. No discipline. He is an echo that returns when the guilt fades and the urge builds again.

Which actually hits harder for you
Are you wired for ritual, structure, and accountability, or are you chasing the lightning strike of a quick drain and silence
Dommes, which model gives you more true control and safer outcomes in the long run
Subs, which model leaves you calmer after, and which one leaves you crawling back sooner

My preference
I prefer connection. I prefer to own the mind and let the wallet follow. I want the daily texts. I want the photo on your knees with your receipt. I want coffee covered before you clock in, lunch sent without a prompt, dinner handled because you remembered your place. I want you to feel me when you breathe. I want you to smell me on your clothes. I want your thoughts to ask for permission before your hands move. Owning a wallet is cute. Owning a soul is delicious.",3,1757479798.0,paypigs2,5,1.0,False

Bahrain‚Äôs 2025 Business Landscape: Growth, Trends, and Regulatory Updates\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting in Bahrain Bay., 2025\
Bahrain‚Äôs economic climate in 2025 is robust: driven by strong FDI inflows, IT sector booms, and optimistic projections from S&P, the nation has outpaced regional peers in economic diversification. The Economic Development Board (EDB) reported over 90 new foreign investments and 12,000+ new jobs last year.\
\
Key business zones: Bahrain Bay (tech and finance), Seef District (retail, professional services), Diplomatic Area (government, banking), and Bahrain Financial Harbour (global HQs)\
Business growth forecast: 4.1% GDP expansion (Reuters), with non-oil sectors leading the charge\
Talent landscape: 91% workforce literacy; high English proficiency; competitive local and expatriate talent pools\
\
These factors have made Bahrain company formation especially attractive for international entrepreneurs, tech startups, and SMEs alike‚Äîespecially given the Kingdom‚Äôs recent 99% foreign ownership reforms.\
\
Importantly, a new 2025 Ministry of Labour directive updates Bahrainization quotas by sector, lowering minimum requirements for tech startups while increasing them for construction and F&B. Implementation began April 1, 2025‚Äîtiming that‚Äôs critical for anyone registering a business or renewing CRs.\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE/Saudi Arabia: A Brief Comparison\
Bahrain‚Äôs value shines in its ease of setup (see free zone options), transparency, and relatively low entry barriers. UAE requires local sponsorship for many activities, while Saudi imposes stricter Saudization targets and higher initial capital floors. Bahrain streamlines everything‚Äîfrom Sijilat CR applications to company structure flexibility.\
\
Understanding Bahrainization: What It Means for Your Hiring\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration: Professional team planning in Bahrain. and enforced during both company formation and ongoing operations, Bahrainization directly influences:\
\
Hiring quotas (local vs. expatriate ratios)\
LMRA block/unblock status for work visas\
Eligibility for Tamkeen wage subsidies\
Renewal of Commercial Registration (CR) via Sijilat\
\
Typical Bahrainization Ratios (2025)\
Service companies: 20% Bahraini minimum\
Industrial setups/F&B: 30%+\
Construction: Up to 50%\
Startups/IT (2025 update): 10-15% (lowered)\
(Personal note: When I initially set up in Seef, I underestimated how quickly LMRA would block work permit applications due to a single Bahraini resignation. It‚Äôs vital to over-hire Bahraini staff or build redundancies, especially for roles like admin and PROs.)\
\
Pro-tip: Always check the official Bahrain Government site and cross-reference Gulf News for real-time quota updates before each hiring cycle.\
\
\
How Bahrainization Directly Shapes Your Hiring Choices\
Step-by-Step: Embedding Bahrainization into Your Recruitment Plan\
\
Determine Your Business Activity and Structure\
For CR registration, identify your business type (WLL, SPC, Branch, etc.)‚Äîeach has specific LMRA quota requirements. Use the entity guide for clarity.\
Check the Latest LMRA Quotas\
Visit LMRA‚Äôs online portal. Each business activity has a table showing minimum Bahraini headcounts. Always plan to exceed the minimum by one, especially before Ramadan when resignations spike.\
Draft an HR Plan Mapped to Quotas\
Design your org chart with Bahraini nationals in anchor roles (admin, finance, compliance, customer service) to minimize risk of falling below quota.\
Time Your Applications Wisely\
Apply for work visas early in the month. LMRA monthly quotas refill at the start, and queues are shorter midweek at the Diplomatic Area branch.\
Document Preparation Shortcuts\
Pre-prepare digital copies of all labor contracts, university degrees (attested), and proof of address for both Bahraini and expat hires. Sijilat‚Äôs upload system times out after 15 minutes‚Äîbatch upload on a Sunday morning for best server speeds.\
\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: Efficient workflow for CR, LMRA, and Sijilat processes., 2025)\
- LMRA visa fees: BHD 72 per year (expat); Bahraini staff exempt from these fees\
- Tamkeen wage subsidies: Up to 50% of Bahraini base salary for 18-24 months for qualifying hires\
- Annual Sijilat renewal: BHD 50-200 based on activity code, with proof of Bahrainization compliance\
\
Detailed cost breakdowns and sample budgets\
\
Practical example:\
A 5-person consulting WLL in Bahrain Bay (2025):\
\
2 Bahraini hires (admin, operations) = BHD 400 x 2 = BHD 800/month\
3 expat hires (consultants) = BHD 1000 x 3 + LMRA fees = BHD 3,216/month\
Tamkeen subsidy on Bahraini hires = -BHD 200/month\
Total monthly payroll: ~BHD 3,816\
\
Biggest budgeting mistake I see: Entrepreneurs underestimating the time and wage buffer required for Bahraini recruitment, especially when scaling. Always budget for at least one replacement hire for every five Bahrainis on staff to keep operations smooth if someone leaves.\
\
Compliance Requirements: Staying Fully Legal\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation: Professional review of regulatory documents.\
* Maintain up-to-date employment contracts and payroll records (digitally and as hard copy‚Äîinspectors often request both)\
* Use outsourced accounting services to ensure flawless recordkeeping and timely wage payments for all Bahrainis\
* Attend MOICT compliance briefings (especially after major policy updates)\
Surprisingly, the most successful Bahraini SMEs I know use a hybrid HR model: a core Bahraini admin team, a lean expat technical staff, and regular Tamkeen application cycles to optimize subsidies and stay audit-ready.\
\
Local Customs and Cultural Tips to Smooth Your Hiring\
\
Regulations aside, ignoring local culture will undermine your Bahrainization efforts faster than any LMRA audit.\
\
\
Host Ramadan-adjusted interviews: Respect shorter working hours and offer post-Iftar networking events\
Serve traditional Qahwa coffee and dates during hiring meetings (especially if held in-person at a Diplomatic Area office)\
Embrace the majlis format for company updates; this encourages retention and trust among Bahraini hires\
\
(I once overlooked Ramadan scheduling and lost a top Bahraini candidate who felt disrespected. Simple local gestures mean everything.)\
\
Best Office Locations for Efficient Company Formation (Save Time and Hassle)\
!(\
The fastest Sijilat CR processing (2025) happens at the Seef District MOICT branch. Queues are shortest before 10am on Tuesdays. For LMRA submissions, the Bahrain Financial Harbour ‚ÄúBusiness Services‚Äù center has bilingual staff and a direct connection to the Tamkeen helpdesk.\
\
Key office location resources for setup and support\
Free zone registration information for streamlined licensing and reduced waiting times\

\
Overcoming Common Bahrainization Challenges (And How I Did It)\
My toughest challenge?\
Right after opening my first Bahrain Bay office, two Bahraini hires resigned for government jobs‚Äîright before a regulatory audit. LMRA blocked my expat visa quota, stalling growth for weeks.\
How I fixed it:\
- Kept a short-list of pre-screened Bahrainis, ready to hire within 48 hours\
- Established relationships with a Tamkeen-approved recruiter (shoutout to Gulf Talent Solutions in Seef)\
- Scheduled biweekly team catch-ups in majlis style, boosting morale and retention\
- Used Keylink‚Äôs accounting and compliance services for real-time quota monitoring\
\
Pro-tip: Don‚Äôt wait for the problem. Build local relationships before you urgently need replacements. Leverage Tamkeen wage support to entice high-quality Bahrainis (it works!).\
\
\
A Tangent: Bahrain‚Äôs Unexpected Edge‚ÄîNetworked Growth\
I once spent an afternoon networking at a Bahrain Chamber of Commerce event in Diplomatic Area‚Äîinitially thinking it‚Äôd be all fluff. Instead, I met a Tamkeen board advisor who later fast-tracked my wage subsidy approval. In Bahrain, every coffee meeting can turn into regulatory gold.\
This culture of openness‚Äîcomplemented by Bahrainization‚Äîmakes it easier to create long-term partnerships, tap into government initiatives, and future-proof your business. Something that‚Äôs harder to achieve in the larger, more transactional UAE or Saudi ecosystems.\
\
Avoiding Common Mistakes: Insider Strategies\
\
Don‚Äôt under-hire Bahrainis. Always staff one extra to prevent LMRA blocks.\
Never delay Sijilat or LMRA updates. Delays = penalties and lost business days.\
Don‚Äôt forget post-formation compliance. Use professional accounting support to manage wage subsidies, contract renewals, and payroll audits.\
Avoid ignoring local customs. Simple gestures‚Äîrespecting Ramadan hours, majlis-style discussions‚Äîpay huge dividends in retention.\

FAQ: Bahrainization & Bahrain Company Formation\
Q: What happens if I fall below Bahrainization quota?\
A: LMRA will block new expat visa applications until you rectify the shortfall. Your CR renewal via Sijilat may also be frozen. See Keylink‚Äôs compliance guide for prevention.\
Q: Can 100% foreign-owned companies avoid Bahrainization?\
A: No. Regardless of ownership level, all licensed entities must meet sector-specific Bahrainization quotas. 99% foreign ownership is permitted, but local hiring rules remain.\
Q: Which sectors have the lowest Bahrainization requirements?\
A: IT startups, fintech, and certain consulting companies (10-15% in 2025). Construction and F&B face higher quotas.\
Q: What documents are required for Bahrainization compliance?\
A: Bahraini ID copies, signed labor contracts, proof of university/secondary education, payroll records, and CR documentation. Always keep digital and hard copies.\
Q: How do I save time on LMRA and Sijilat processing?\

""I accept your terms."" My voice remained steady as I spoke into the phone. ""I'll return as the heiress.""  
  
The line went dead.  
  
I stared at the bedroom that had been my prison for eight long years. A bitter smile touched my lips. Eight years of devotion. Eight years of patience. Eight years of love. All for nothing.  
  
""How dare you wear my mother's dress!""  
  
The shrill voice shattered my thoughts. I turned slowly to face Liam, his small face contorted with rage.  
  
""You're not going to say anything?"" he demanded, tiny hands clenched into fists.  
  
""Your friends are waiting, Liam."" I kept my voice soft. ""You should go enjoy your party.""  
  
""No!"" he screamed.  
  
He grabbed the ceramic pitcher from the table and threw its contents at me. Scalding hot coffee drenched my dress and skin. I cried out in pain.  
  
""Serves you right! You'll never replace my mother! You killed her with your evil heart!"" Liam shouted. ""And now you're wearing her favorite dress!""  
  
A maid rushed into the room. She gasped at the sight of me covered in coffee stains, my skin already reddening from burns.  
  
""I'm so sorry, Miss! Liam escaped from his minders."" The maid grabbed the smirking boy and hurried away.  
  
I retreated to the bathroom. The dress had never belonged to Isabella, my stepsister who died giving birth to Liam. It was mine‚Äîa gift from my late mother that Isabella had stolen from me. Just like she stole everything else.  
  
Eight years ago, I was supposed to marry Alexander Russo. We were childhood sweethearts. I believed we were in love. Then he married Isabella. She became pregnant. She lived the life that should have been mine.  
  
Then she died. Everyone called me bad luck. They accused me of killing her out of jealousy.  
  
As Isabella's only sister and Alexander's former fianc√©e, I was sent to care for Liam. My stepmother told me to treat him like my own son.  
  
For eight years, I did exactly that. I loved Liam as my own. I cared for Alexander too. But I was foolish. Alexander never loved me.  
  
They both treated me like garbage. They made sure I knew my place‚Äînothing but a live-in nanny. A servant.  
  
Liam never respected me. He constantly found ways to hurt me. But today, on his eighth birthday, I decided enough was enough.  
  
If this had happened three years ago, I would have begged for his forgiveness. Not anymore.  
  
""The party has started."" Alexander's voice came from the doorway. ""Where are you, Rachel?""  
  
I emerged from the bathroom just as he entered. He sighed at the sight of my stained dress.  
  
""I heard what Liam did. Don't take it personally. He's just a child who loves you,"" Alexander said.  
  
I laughed bitterly. ""That boy doesn't know the first thing about loving me.""  
  
""Don't say that. He's a good kid."" Alexander frowned.  
  
I moved away from him and reached for the healing balm on the nightstand. My skin burned where the coffee had scalded it. The ointment would work miracles overnight.  
  
""Let me help you."" Alexander took the balm from my hands before I could protest.  
  
His fingers gently massaged the ointment into my burned skin. Years ago, his touch would have made me weak. Now it made my skin crawl.  
  
""Be patient with him,"" he whispered, his breath warm against my neck.  
  
I pulled away. ""I need to tell you something.""  
  
""Can't it wait? Liam's birthday celebration has begun.""  
  
""No, it can't wait."" I met his gaze directly. ""Eight years is enough. I'm leaving.""Chapter 2  
  
""What are you talking about?"" Alexander's voice boomed.  
  
I saw his expression darken with rage.  
  
The air grew thick with tension.  
  
But I refused to back down.  
  
""It's been eight years, Alexander. I want out,"" I stated clearly.  
  
He glared at me. ""What's wrong with you? Why cause trouble now? I told you Liam is just a kid. Don't take his actions personally. It's his birthday today. Come with me. I'll deal with him later.""  
  
Alexander reached for my hand, pulling me toward the door.  
  
I snatched my hand back. ""You promised I could leave when he turned eight. So why am I the one causing trouble?"" I challenged.  
  
Before he could respond, an angry voice cut through the air.  
  
""Rachel, you have no shame! Always making everything about you, even on my grandson's special day!""  
  
I recognized that voice instantly.  
  
Victoria. My stepmother. Liam's grandmother.  
  
She was the one who made the deal with Alexander. Eight years, then freedom.  
  
So why were they acting like this now?  
  
""I'm not making it about me, Victoria. You said I could leave after eight years,"" I reminded her.  
  
She laughed mockingly. ""Did you have to bring this up today?""  
  
""It's fine. I'm sure Rachel didn't mean any harm,"" Alexander interrupted.  
  
In the past, his defense would have made me blush.  
  
Now I knew better. It was just another pathetic attempt to keep me trapped.  
  
""Come on, let's join the party,"" Alexander said to me.  
  
I stayed silent, letting him lead me to the ongoing celebration.  
  
Liam and his friends were playing happily.  
  
His smile vanished when he saw me.  
  
""Look, Liam, your mom's here,"" someone said.  
  
He scoffed loudly. ""She's not my mother!""  
  
I stood nearby while Alexander sighed and pulled Liam close.  
  
""We don't say things like that. Rachel is your mother. She's taken good care of you,"" Alexander stated firmly.  
  
Liam's face twisted with anger. ""No! She can never be my mother. Everyone, this woman killed my real mom!""  
  
Whispers spread through the party hall.  
  
All eyes turned to me.  
  
""She's the boy's aunt.""  
  
""Why doesn't the boy like her?""  
  
""Clearly she's not treating him well.""  
  
""Apologize to her right now,"" Alexander demanded.  
  
I stopped him. ""It's fine. It doesn't matter.""  
  
I walked away calmly.  
  
In the past, Liam's words would have shattered me.  
  
But I've accepted the truth.  
  
No matter what I do, Alexander's heart will always belong to Isabella.  
  
Liam will always blame me for taking his mother's place.  
  
""Why did you have to make a scene today?""  
  
Victoria's sharp voice cut through my thoughts.  
  
She stepped into view, glaring.  
  
""What do you want, Victoria? I've played my part for eight years. I'm done,"" I said.  
  
""You should care for Liam like your own son. Tolerate his behavior. Look after him. If my daughter were alive, he'd be treated much better,"" she snapped.  
  
I shrugged, exhausted. ""Too bad your daughter isn't here.""  
  
Victoria raised her hand to strike me.  
  
I caught her wrist. ""Don't try it. I'm not in the mood. Eight years ago you forced me to come here and take care of them. The contract is over. Liam is eight. I have every right to leave.""  
  
She yanked her hand back, rubbing her sore wrist.  
  
She glared at me. ""Do what you want, Rachel. This is why no one will ever love you. Even your father can't stand you!"" she hissed before storming off.  
  
A bitter smile touched my lips.  
  
Eight years since I last saw my father.  
  
Since his favorite daughter died and he sent me away.  
  
He never cared to visit.  
  
""I'm sorry. I got you a gift.""  
  
A small voice spoke behind me.  
  
I turned to see Liam standing there with an innocent smile.  
  
He held a wrapped gift box.  
  
I smiled. ""Aww, you shouldn't have.""  
  
He giggled. ""I wanted to. Please, open it.""  
  
I took the box and opened it.  
  
A foul smell hit my nose.  
  
Inside was the lifeless body of my cat, Oliver, killed with an arrow.  
  
""That will be you soon if you don't leave me and my father alone,"" Liam giggled.Chapter 3I stared in horror at the only pet I‚Äôd been permitted to bring to the estate.  
  
My hands trembled as I looked at the arrow piercing Oliver‚Äôs small body.  
  
I had raised Liam with the same tenderness.  
  
Yet this was how he repaid me.  
  
‚ÄúStay out of my way,‚Äù Liam snapped, his voice cold.  
  
‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt you dare upset my father because of this.‚Äù  
  
He stormed off without a backward glance.  
  
I remained frozen, my gaze locked on the lifeless form of my cat.  
  
The irony was cruel.  
  
I had taught Liam how to handle a bow.  
  
I had taught him so much.  
  
Now he turned every lesson against me.  
  
Cradling the small box, I let a tear escape.  
  
Oliver had been my silent companion through countless lonely nights.  
  
‚ÄúRachel, what are you doing out here in the cold?‚Äù Alexander‚Äôs voice cut through the evening air.  
  
He stepped out into the garden, concern etching his features.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll catch a chill.‚Äù  
  
He moved behind me, draping his jacket over my shoulders.  
  
I shook it off immediately.  
  
His eyes fell to the box in my arms, and his expression tightened with distaste.  
  
‚ÄúYour son came to apologize,‚Äù I said flatly.  
  
Alexander‚Äôs frown deepened.  
  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs your son too, Rachel.‚Äù  
  
I let out a bitter laugh.  
  
‚ÄúHe despises me, Alexander.  
  
He killed my cat.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúCome inside,‚Äù he urged, his tone softening.  
  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll discuss this with Liam in the morning.  
  
You can bury the cat tomorrow.  
  
It was just a boy‚Äôs thoughtless prank.‚Äù  
  
I pulled away, clutching the box tighter.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not leaving him outside for the animals.‚Äù  
  
Though he complained about my stubbornness, Alexander followed me into the garden.  
  
He stood silently as I dug a small grave under the old oak tree.  
  
When it was done, I brushed the dirt from my hands and turned toward the house.  
  
The party had ended.  
  
The guests were gone.  
  
The wind picked up, biting through my thin dress.  
  
I sneezed just as Alexander reached for me.  
  
He guided me inside and up to my room.  
  
He sat me on his lap, but I stiffened, pulling away.  
  
‚ÄúWhat do you want, Alexander?‚Äù I demanded.  
  
He sighed.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll get you another cat, Rachel.  
  
A dozen if you wish.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI want to leave.  
  
Tomorrow.‚Äù  
  
Alexander‚Äôs body went rigid.  
  
‚ÄúLiam is just a child.  
  
I trust no one else with him.  
  
Where would you even go?  
  
You have no one.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll manage,‚Äù I said, my voice hollow.  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt belong here.  
  
You refused to marry me after eight years, Alexander.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou know why I can‚Äôt take another wife now,‚Äù he replied, frustration creeping into his tone.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking you to.  
  
I don‚Äôt want to marry you.  
  
I just want to go.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThen have my child,‚Äù he said suddenly, his eyes intent.  
  
‚ÄúA child would secure your position.  
  
No one would dare disrespect you then.  
  
And Liam would have a sibling.‚Äù  
  
A sad smile touched my lips.  
  
I had sacrificed everything for this family‚Äîmy pride, my youth, my self-respect.  
  
And still, he wanted me to bear an illegitimate child.  
  
All to keep me under his roof, all to control me.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve already instructed the maid on Liam‚Äôs routine.  
  
He‚Äôs homeschooled‚Äîhire better tutors or send him to school.  
  
He doesn‚Äôt need me.‚Äù  
  
Alexander leaned in and kissed me.  
  
‚ÄúSleep on it.  
  
We‚Äôll talk in the morning.‚Äù  
  
But I didn‚Äôt sleep.  
  
I packed my bags through the night, Oliver‚Äôs still face haunting me.  
  
Morning arrived too soon.  
  
After a quick shower, I dragged my suitcases downstairs.  
  
This was it.  
  
I was finally leaving.  
  
But peace was not in the cards for me.  
  
A slow, mocking clap echoed across the courtyard.  
  
Sophia leaned against a pillar, a smirk playing on her lips.  
  
‚ÄúWell, well.  
  
Finally developed some self-respect, have you?‚Äù  
  
I ignored her, continuing toward the gate.  
  
She stepped into my path, blocking my exit.  
  
‚ÄúEight years, Rachel.  
  
Eight years you spent waiting for a man who never wanted you.  
  
And now you‚Äôre walking away?‚Äù  
  
She chuckled.  
  
‚ÄúTook you long enough to understand.  
  
Alexander and Liam will never love you.  
  
You were always just the worthless mistress.‚Äù  
  
I met her gaze, my face expressionless.  
  
‚ÄúEnjoy your victory then.  
  
Do as you please.  
  
None of this matters to me anymore.‚Äù  
  
Her smirk widened.  
  
‚ÄúOh, I will.  
  
Soon I‚Äôll be moving in.  
  
I‚Äôll take everything that was never yours.‚Äù  
  
Before I could reply, the front doors flew open.  
  
Alexander stepped out, Liam close behind.  
  
In an instant, Sophia‚Äôs demeanor shattered.  
  
She fell to her knees, clutching the hem of my dress with theatrical desperation.  
  
‚ÄúRachel, please don‚Äôt go!‚Äù she sobbed, her voice trembling.  
  
‚ÄúLiam needs you!  
  
How can you abandon him after all these years?‚Äù  
  
I stared down at her, numb.  
  
‚ÄúHe loves you, he really does!‚Äù she cried, tears streaming down her face.  
  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a boy!  
  
Please, I beg you‚Äîdon‚Äôt leave him!‚Äù  
  
Alexander let out an impatient sigh.  
  
‚ÄúStop this nonsense, Sophia.  
  
You‚Äôre making a scene.‚Äù  
  
His eyes were cold as they settled on me.  
  
‚ÄúI said I‚Äôd replace the cat.  
  
Don‚Äôt upset Sophia over something so trivial.‚Äù  
  
I clenched my fists, but before I could speak, Liam rushed to Sophia‚Äôs side.  
  
He helped her up, his small hands wiping her fake tears.  
  
Then he turned to me, his eyes burning with hatred.  
  
‚ÄúYou killed my mother with your wickedness,‚Äù he spat.  
  
‚ÄúAnd now you‚Äôre trying to hurt Sophia too?‚Äù  
  
His voice shook with anger.  
  
He looked back at Sophia, his expression softening.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry.  
  
Let her go.  
  
I don‚Äôt want her here.  
  
I don‚Äôt need her.‚Äù  
  
He lifted his chin, his words sharp as blades.  
  
‚ÄúI want you to be my mother.  
  
You should marry my father.‚Äù  
  
Then his eyes returned to me, filled with pure scorn.  
  
‚ÄúYou have an evil heart.  
  
That‚Äôs why my father could never love you.‚Äù  
  
A cruel smile touched his lips.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre leaving.‚Äù  
  
I swallowed the pain thickening in my throat.  
  
I took one last look at the boy I had raised, the child I had loved as my own.  
  
‚ÄúAfter eight years,‚Äù I said quietly, ‚Äúif this is what you believe of me, then there‚Äôs no reason left to stay.‚Äù  
  
Without another word, I turned and walked toward the gate.  
  
Just as I reached it, I heard the familiar sound of a crossbow being drawn.  
  
An arrow whizzed past, missing my head by inches.Chapter 4Isabella‚Äôs POV  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think pretending to be pitiful will make me keep you as my stepmother!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúIf you have the guts to leave, never come back!‚Äù  
  
The sharp arrow flew straight toward me, loaded with the boy‚Äôs bitter rage.  
  
I barely moved in time, but it still sliced deep into my shoulder.  
  
A raw cry tore from my throat.  
  
Alexander was at my side instantly, holding me as I clenched my teeth against the pain.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Isabella,‚Äù he cried out.  
  
Just then, Sophia screamed, and Liam shouted too.  
  
‚ÄúPapa, come quick! Aunt Sophia twisted her ankle running to help that witch!‚Äù Liam yelled.  
  
Alexander looked torn, his eyes darting between my bleeding shoulder and Sophia‚Äôs dramatic fall.  
  
He released me with a heavy sigh.  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a clean wound, Isabella. Go to the hospital‚ÄîI‚Äôll meet you there. Sophia can‚Äôt walk; I have to take her,‚Äù he said.  
  
I didn‚Äôt let my disappointment show.  
  
I stayed on the ground, watching him walk away from me‚Äîagain.  
  
He carried Sophia in his arms, bridal style.  
  
She shot me a smug look as they got into the car and drove off with Liam.  
  
There I was, left alone on the cold floor, bleeding from a wound given by the child I had raised, trained, and taught to shoot.  
  
Life could be so cruel.  
  
I struggled to stand when I heard footsteps behind me.  
  
‚ÄúYou wretched girl! Why are you still here? Didn‚Äôt you tell the whole city you were leaving?‚Äù  
  
I knew that voice. It was Eleanor, Alexander‚Äôs mother. She had always despised me.  
  
I forced myself up and turned to face her.  
  
She gasped when she saw my injury and the blood staining my clothes.  
  
‚ÄúTrying to frame my son? If you want to die, do it somewhere else!‚Äù she spat.  
  
‚ÄúI was leaving when your grandson shot me,‚Äù I replied coldly.  
  
She laughed mockingly. ‚ÄúHurt yourself and now blaming a child? You‚Äôre just acting pitiful so Alexander pities you. You lost your place here the moment you decided to go.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI want nothing from you or your family, Eleanor. Your grandson did this!‚Äù I snapped.  
  
She smirked. ‚ÄúThen you won‚Äôt mind getting out.‚Äù  
  
Before I could respond, she snatched my luggage and threw it outside the gate.  
  
‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù she hissed, shoving me out too. ‚ÄúGo die somewhere else. Leave my son alone.‚Äù  
  
I stumbled and fell, clutching my bleeding shoulder.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll regret this,‚Äù I vowed, fury burning in my chest.  
  
I gathered my boxes just as my Uber pulled up.  
  
‚ÄúSorry I‚Äôm late, Miss,‚Äù the driver said.  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I muttered, sliding into the back seat.  
  
He eyed my shoulder. ‚ÄúStill heading to the airport?‚Äù  
  
I shook my head. ‚ÄúTake me to the hospital first.‚Äù  
  
I leaned back and closed my eyes, exhaustion taking over.  
  
I woke to the steady beeping of an EKG machine.  
  
I was in a hospital room. My arm throbbed with pain when I tried to sit up.  
  
My boxes were stacked neatly beside the bed.  
  
The door opened, and a doctor walked in.  
  
‚ÄúMiss Isabella, how are you feeling?‚Äù he asked.  
  
I groaned. ‚ÄúWhat happened? Last thing I remember, I was in a cab.‚Äù  
  
The doctor nodded. ‚ÄúYou passed out before arriving. The Uber driver brought you in.‚Äù  
  
I checked my phone. I‚Äôd missed my flight.  
  
A new text waited. I replied quickly.  
  
Something came up. Reschedule my flight ASAP.  
  
‚ÄúMiss Isabella?‚Äù The doctor pulled my attention back.  
  
I lifted a brow. ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou lost a lot of blood, but you‚Äôve been treated. You‚Äôll be discharged soon,‚Äù he explained.  
  
I nodded. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù  
  
He smiled and left. I stood and reached for my boxes.  
  
Not a single call or message from Alexander.  
  
His son shot me, and he couldn‚Äôt even check if I was alive.  
  
The door swung open.  
  
Sophia walked in, looking pleased with herself.  
  
I rolled my eyes.  
  
‚ÄúWhat do you want? I thought you twisted your ankle,‚Äù I said flatly.  
  
She giggled. ‚ÄúOh, that? I just wanted to see who Alexander would choose. And he picked me! Exciting, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù  
  
I scoffed. ‚ÄúHave your fun, Sophia. I‚Äôm leaving.‚Äù  
  
She stepped in front of me, a smug smile on her lips.  
  
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something you should know,‚Äù she said, voice dripping with pride. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pregnant. With Alexander‚Äôs baby.‚Äù  
  
The air left my lungs.  
  
My heart shattered, but I refused to let it show.  
  
I wouldn‚Äôt give her the satisfaction.  
  
Eight years.  
  
Eight years by his side, and I was never more than a shadow.  
  
He always made me take birth control right after he was done with me.  
  
He always wanted another child.  
  
Just not with me.Chapter 5  
  
""Goodbye, Sophia,"" I told her.  
  
She stood firmly in my path, refusing to let me pass.  
  
My patience was wearing thin. My phone had just buzzed with a flight update‚Äîrescheduled, and I couldn't miss it this time.  
  
All I wanted was to get away from these people. Why was she purposely provoking me?  
  
""What do you want?"" I demanded.  
  
Sophia gave a sly smile. ""I want to see you break down.""  
  
I let out a harsh laugh. ""Not going to happen.""  
  
As I tried to move past her with my box, she threw a few dollar bills at my feet.  
  
""For your taxi fare,"" she sneered.  
  
Something in me snapped. Before I could stop myself, my hand flew out and struck her across the face.  
  
""How dare you?"" I seethed.  
  
Sophia screamed loudly, just as Alexander and Liam rushed into the room.  
  
""What did you do, Isabella?"" Alexander shouted, seeing Sophia‚Äôs reddened cheek.  
  
I glared back. ""What did I do? You come running when she screams. Where were you when your son shot me? Where were you when I was bleeding out?""  
  
""Evil woman!"" Liam cried out. ""She hurt Sophia!""  
  
""It's not her fault, Liam,"" Sophia whimpered. ""I came to ask her to stay. I offered her money, and she hit me.""  
  
""Stop the act, Sophia. Stop playing the victim!"" I snapped.  
  
""No, you stop, Isabella!"" Alexander shot back. ""I‚Äôve been too easy on you. Apologize to Sophia, and I might take you back.""  
  
I stared at him, then burst into laughter. ""Even if you were the last man alive, Alexander, I would never be with you.""  
  
""What is that supposed to mean? How dare you speak to me like that?"" he roared.  
  
""Eight years, and you never wanted a child. Then I find out on the same day your son shoots me that Sophia is pregnant with your baby,"" I stated coldly.  
  
Alexander shot a quick, questioning look at Sophia, as if asking why she had told me.  
  
""We can discuss that later. Just come home. We can work this out,"" he said, softening his tone.  
  
""In your dreams,"" I retorted.  
  
I turned and walked away, ignoring his demands for me to stop.  
  
A short while later, I arrived at the airport just in time for my flight.  
  
As I was checking in and about to switch off my phone, it rang.  
  
It was Alexander. Reluctantly, I answered.  
  
""What do you want?"" I snapped.  
  
""I know you‚Äôre upset about Sophia‚Äôs pregnancy. Come home. Give me a child, and I‚Äôll add your name to my will. You and your child will want for nothing,"" he said.  
  
""Go to hell, Alexander,"" I replied coldly.  
  
I hung up and blocked his number without another word.  
  
The flight was long. I slept through most of it, relieved when the plane finally landed.  
  
I stepped into the arrivals hall with my boxes and noticed a well-dressed man in a tuxedo holding a sign that read: Isabella Sterling.  
  
I approached him, and he recognized me immediately.  
  
""Miss Sterling, I‚Äôm Christopher. Your personal guard,"" he introduced himself.  
  
""Thank you,"" I said with a nod.  
  
He took my luggage, loaded it into the car, and opened the back door for me.  
  
I sank into the plush leather seat of the SUV, relaxing as we drove off. Soon, we arrived at a grand mansion.  
  
This was the home of my grandparents, Benjamin and Charlotte Sterling.  
  
Their company, Sterling Enterprises, was the largest in New York, and I was their only heir.  
  
Three years ago, they reached out and revealed they were my mother‚Äôs parents. My mother was supposed to marry someone else, but she eloped with my father for love and left her family behind.  
  
Unbeknownst to me, when my mother was dying of cancer, she had contacted them and told them about me.  
  
When they first asked me to take over, I was still deeply in love with Alexander and believed I could win his heart. I had refused their offer.  
  
""Isabella! Welcome home,"" my grandmother‚Äôs voice called out.  
  
She and my grandfather came outside and wrapped me in a warm embrace.  
  
""We‚Äôre so happy you‚Äôre here,"" they said.  
  
I smiled. ""Thank you for having me.""  
  
My grandmother waved a hand. ""Nonsense, Isabella. All of this is yours.""  
  
My grandfather nodded. ""Yes, Isabella. You are now the heiress of Sterling Enterprises.""  
  
I smiled.

1nd52jd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicDating/comments/1nd52jd/ladies_on_the_dating_apps_why_do_some_of_you/,Ladies on the dating apps - why do some of you unmatch when things are going well?,"I will start by saying I'm not lumping \*all"" women into a box, nor am I suggesting that all women do this. However, it's happened enough times that I kind of want an explanation. I understand that nobody on a dating app owes me anything, but when things are going seemingly well, I can't help but wonder what's happening. I will give three recent examples, and in each case, the women looked like practicing Catholics with normal profiles (no obvious red flags). All these interactions were on Hinge as well.

\- Woman #1 messaged me first asking about my job (we both work in the same field). I responded with a light-hearted joke about our industry, and then asked how she likes her job. I never got a response and she disappeared from my matches.

\- Woman #2 and I were chatting on the app for a little bit, and it seemed like we had a lot in common. After a couple days of sporadic messaging, I said something along the lines of ""if you want to continue getting to know each other, my phone number is...."" After that, she was gone.

\- Woman #3 is the most confusing to me. We were having very good conversations on the app, and after a little while, I asked if she wanted to meet for a lunch or coffee date. She said she would love to, and I offered up some potential days. She then said she would check her work schedule and get back to me. As you can probably guess, I never heard from her again and she unmatched.

A little context about myself - I'm 25 years old, work as a Certified public accountant, and consider myself a fairly good looking guy with good morals. I enjoy physical activities like golf, martial arts, and going to the beach. I have nothing weird in my profile that would turn somebody off. My sister (who also practices her faith) helped me make my profile and select the pictures, lol. Would appreciate some insight.",2,1757479485.0,CatholicDating,10,1.0,False
1nd51jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1nd51jv/i_believe_the_end_is_in_sight_for_my_severe/,I believe the end is in sight for my severe Dyshidrotic Eczema,"The story of my dyshidrotic eczema began in early 2024, a few months after I gave birth to my son. Although I had one small blister that had shown up and disappeared a few times during my teenage years, above the middle knuckle on my left middle finger. This spot is where it started this time too. I had been washing my hands lots, touching wet wipes (ones supposedly for sensitive skin), and using hand sanitiser. I already knew I had somewhat sensitive skin, my mother has sensitive skin and rosacea too, and come to find out she also has had these itchy spots appear on her feet before too (I have not) but not severely. 

So in early 2024 the spot on my middle finger came back, I can‚Äôt remember how it progressed (baby brain). I thought it was bad, and it was, but it was nothing compared to what would come. I stopped using sanitiser altogether and changed all the soaps in the house to using Dermaveen extra sensitive liquid soap (I now use saponified oil bar soap for sensitive skin). I have tried many things in this time: Nettle cream, Dermaveen baby eczema cream (helped for a short while), Manuka oil cream from two different brands, and a Manuka oil balm, betamethasone (this was prescribed by a doctor. I only tried it for a short while. I do not recommend trying steroids at all, it is a rabbit hole that honestly just makes it worse in the long run), colloidal silver, and I‚Äôm sure there are other topical things I tried in this time that I cannot remember now. I tried cutting things out to see if they would help, such as gluten and coffee/caffeine, as well as tinned foods, I am vegan so already do not consume animal products. I tried putting creams and oil ointments (not petroleum based, as I refuse to put carcinogens on my body, even though they were bizarrely recommended by my doctor) under gloves and wearing that to bed at night, which progressed to also sometimes during the day. I remember thinking this was helping, probably because it was keeping my hands from cracking as much, but I really believe now that it hinders it in the long run, because this is a WET HEAT disorder, so that only masks it and hinders the true healing. I tried putting coconut oil on under my gloves, which actually caused me to get a dry itchy rash on the backs on my hands which had not happened before, so I stopped that quickly. I then decided to stop everything and just let my hands be dry. I felt defeated. My hands were so sore, raw, itchy, cracked, and swollen. All of the fingers on my right hand were affected and swollen, and the ring finger on that hand was affected on the tip and my nail too it seemed, which started to grow weird with pits in it. On my left hand a couple of fingers and my palm and top of hand around my thumb were also affected. I couldn‚Äôt do anything, I couldn‚Äôt bend them, they cracked easily, I was miserable. I couldn‚Äôt touch my partner without feeling embarrassed, I couldn‚Äôt stroke my son‚Äôs hair and face or pick my son up properly and change his nappy without my wounds cracking open again. I would get insane itchiness that I could not help but rub raw, and I would get a wave of heat and what I would describe as histamine flood down my arms and into my hands, I would sweat so much from that response. Of course I would regret it very soon after, but it was so hard to resist. I felt ashamed when I would itch it, like I was a junkie of sorts, I wouldn‚Äôt even notice I was doing it sometimes. I cried a lot, I was so embarrassed for anyone to see my hands, I was at a very low point. I did a lot of research in this time too, which led to some of those things I tried, but everything had to be breastfeeding friendly, so some things that I wanted to try I couldn‚Äôt, such as Chinese medicinal herbs for dry cooling, or doing detoxes/internal cleanses. 

I honestly gave up and just accepted that this was unfortunately my life. That was until I was researching again and realised my hands were REALLY fucked up. I had lost sight in this struggle over my hands of how far gone it had become. I realised I did not deserve to live like this and just accept it!

SO WHAT WORKED?

After I stopped all treatment, creams and lotions and my cotton gloves. My hands did get very dry and cracked, but I persevered as I had nothing else to lose, I had been going through absolute hell for over a year at this point. 
I suspected that my fingers were in fact infected. I decided to try some drops of tea tree oil in a big bowl of lukewarm water, which I submerged my hands in and moved them around to keep the oil from sitting on the top of the water. I then would take my hands out and allow them to air dry. It honestly helped from that first time I did it, but it wasn‚Äôt ideal. I tried it a few more times, also adding Manuka oil to the soak, with the same process, doing this once a day for over a week. There was improvement in some fingers. I knew that the oil was helping, but that it wasn‚Äôt working as well as perhaps it could have due to the oils not mixing with the water properly. But I did not want to apply it directly to my skin for fear of irritation, or even put it in a carrier oil for fear of trapping the wet heat in with the oil. 

I then decided to try herbal medicine. I had already been drinking CHAMOMILE tea for reducing cortisol, as well as NETTLE tea for its antihistamine properties. 
I made a poultice by simmering dried CALENDULA (for cleansing) and CHAMOMILE (for calming) for two minutes on the stove, squeezed most of the excess liquid out and applied the herbs to my remaining most infected (assuming) fingers, and wrapped a bandage around them. I left that on there for about two hours, then took it off and allowed to air dry. There was not a huge difference at first, although it definitely did help the swelling. This is the only time I did the poultice. From that day on though for over a week now I have been doing a soak of CALENDULA, CHAMOMILE and MARSHMALLOW ROOT (contains mucilage which helps protect the skin). I infuse the herbs in a big bowl like a tea, using boiling water for a few minutes, and then add some cool water to make it lukewarm (if it is too warm it will irritate your hands and make them itchy, I suspect due to the hot wet nature of the condition itself). I soak them in there for hopefully 20 minutes, I even find the little bits of marshmallow root in the soak and rub them/the mucilage gently on my most irritated bits in the water, and then let them air dry. This in itself has helped tremendously with the ‚Äòinfection‚Äô, which is now completely gone! I also began putting plain ALOE VERA gel (Important to note: get one with minimal ingredients if you do not have access to raw aloe vera (I don‚Äôt), and try to get pure inner leaf, as the outer layer contains latex. The one I bought contains only inner leaf aloe juice, feniol and guar gum if I remember correctly) on my hands after the air drying, and also anytime I wash my hands. This adds a protective layer on my skin that lasts until it is washed off. When I touch water again after this I can actually feel the slipperiness of the gel still there, which just amazes me. 

I think the aloe Vera paired with the herbal hand soak has been the biggest life changer for me and my poor hands, and has honestly made me so hopeful for the end of this horrific journey being very close in sight. I feel so happy to pretty much have my hands back to normal! 

My hands still get a tiny bit itchy sometimes, but not anywhere near as much as they have, and I am not really having any new outbreaks. I am hopeful that this will completely disappear very soon, as it seems like it will. The pictures I will attach should speak for themselves and attest to how much this has saved me in such a small amount of time. 

If you are like I was and completely defeated and miserable, you have nothing to lose by giving what I did a go. I really hope that I can save at least one person from some of, if not all of the pain and heartache that I went through. 

Key pointers/things that I think help:
- wash hands with only water 
- If you need to use soap I would use a sensitive bar soap (just saponified oils). For example I have been using ‚ÄòDindi Naturals: Sensitive Hemp Soap Bar‚Äô (honestly think this is better than Dermaveen which is ‚Äòsensitive‚Äô but also full of random chemicals)
- Wear latex-free cotton-lined gloves whenever touching irritating things, such as washing dishes etc. 
- do a daily lukewarm soak of infused calendula, chamomile and marshmallow root, followed by the most natural inner-leaf aloe Vera gel you can find (I have been using Aloe Australia: Inner-leaf gel)
- Anytime you wash your hands also apply the aloe Vera gel
- Drink nettle leaf tea for its antihistamine effects
- Drink chamomile tea to reduce cortisol 
- Reduce caffeine (I still have my coffee because I am weak for it right now while sleep deprived, but it also increases cortisol) 
- Don‚Äôt wear anything (fabric or moisturiser etc) that is going to trap heat and moisture in completely
- Don‚Äôt itch please, I know it is so so tough! 
- Don‚Äôt use baby wipes (we now just use cotton rounds with warm water on our son and wet washcloths) 
- NO STEROID CREAM!!! Seriously don‚Äôt do it! 

If you are going through this right now, I know it is one of the worst things. I saw someone say in another post something along the lines of  ‚Äòhaving mutilated hands is a particularly brutal kind of hell‚Äô and I agree so much. I see you, I feel your pain, I know what you‚Äôre going through and the mental and physical load it causes, you‚Äôre not alone. You are strong and will get through this, there is an end in sight! 

I wish you resilience, strength and perseverance in resolving this horrible issue, and sincerely send you my love and prayers in healing ü§çü§çü§ç

1nd4zzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhittakerFamily/comments/1nd4zzw/erics_evening_live_recap_9925_part_1/,Eric's Evening Live Recap 9/9/25 PART 1,"Notes from me: I have just kind of summarized the first part of the video because Eric really wasn't talking about much specifically. When he really started addressing the specific stuff is when I started getting more specific to capture fairly precisely what was being said. This is only the first part of the video as I haven't made it all the way through yet. This is a really long video and this is time-consuming to do, especially because I had a young child I had to get to bed tonight in the middle of it. I used voice to put everything into my tablet so I am aware that the Whitaker name is spelled wrong so I apologize. I don't have the time to go back through and correct every one of them and don't feel like transferring everything over to my laptop to put it into word to fix it all. I did do a run-through and try to fix spelling and grammatical errors, but a lot of it is as Eric spoke, so there's that. On to the first half of the video...


Eric starts out the video saying he was aware and knew when he he was coming on board with the Whitakers and Patrick that he would be under public scrutiny because the popularity of the Whitakers is like none other. It is hard to do content creation. People think that it is an easy thing to do but it really isn't. And people think that you make a ton of money, which some creators do, but most don't. Again, he talks about how much he works and works hard to make the money as a content creator to pay his bills. He's not living a rich life he is living paycheck to paycheck.

First red flags noticed by Eric: 
1.	The state of Patrick's house when he comes to visit for the first time. Patrick offers Eric to stay at his house. Eric doesn't stay there as he was expecting to do and had to rent a hotel instead.  
2.	Patrick having things repossessed.Basically, Patrick not being in a good financial state and Patrick talking about things representative of that. 
3.	Money  being spent: First, in regards to the boot store. They were supposed to be going to get an A/C for the Whitakers and on the way Patrick drives to this boot store where he proceeds to spend $500 in outfits for both him (Patrick) and Timmy.
4.	Eric reminds Patrick that they need to go get the A/C that they promise the Whitakers. Patrick tells Eric that there is no money for an A/C. Eric didn't know what to think about this because Patrick just spent $500 at the boot store. So, they go to get an AC which Eric has to pay for. He wasn't happy about it because he didn't have a lot of money as he lives paycheck to paycheck and his budget is really tight. Thankfully he found one on sale that was a scratch and dent item and bought it but it left him with only $100 in his personal banking account. Again, he was tighter on money then originally intentioned because he had to go get the hotel room that he wasn't planning on originally. 
5.	Patrick wanted to go get Chick-fil-A on the way home. Patrick went to Chick-fil-A and bought 12 sandwiches and sweet tea and whatever else. Eric didn't get any food. Eric's Patrick was going to take food back for the Whitakers, but no, none of that food was for the Whitakers and Patrick kept it all at his house. 
6.	Patrick wanted to go to the coffee shop and get coffee and he asked Eric if he wanted to go get coffee and Eric didn't want to. They pull up to the coffee place and there are a group of underage girls there. Patrick yells at them and ask them if they know who Timmy is that's with them and they say no. Patrick tells them that Timmy is known around the world and ask if they would want a picture. Eric said that made him very uncomfortable. And again Patrick had told Eric that he had no money left to go get an AC and yet he keeps spending this money. 
7.	When Eric is at Patrick's house he hears Patrick cursing out somebody on the phone. Patrick throws the phone at Eric and tells him to deal with it. Eric gets on the phone and the guy ends up telling Eric that he is mad at Patrick because Patrick stole this guy's deceased grandfather's tools from his grandmother worth the amount of $12,000. Eric asked Patrick if that was the truth and Patrick said yes and he told him the truth. He didn't like knowing what happened but it was okay, he knows he's not perfect and people make mistakes and as long as Patrick paid her back, which Patrick told Eric he was going to do, so Eric took Patrick's word that he would. 

Supposedly this first meeting all came out of Eric's own pocket and the income from his other projects and he was only left with $100 when the 1st Whitaker trip was said and done with and he was stressed about it because he's never overdrafted his bank account in his adult life and he didn't think he would make it without much money left until he got paid again. But he barely did and it was all okay in the end.

Early July (July 11th I think), Eric made a video with Dwayne about the red flags and never shared it. They did that video just in case something happens and they needed to post it. He didn't post it because he knew that what was happening now would have ended up happening then. Eric says that Patrick was appreciative in the beginning with Eric and Patrick told him that he was glad Eric didn't run away from him like other people would. He says that he believes there is a part of Patrick that wants to become better.
Patrick tells Eric that the Whitakers are wanting to do an event with a well-known bluegrass band and do a meet and greet. Eric says he was a concert promoter in his twenties and it is not so easy to organize an event in a couple of weeks as that is the notice that Patrick gave him. He said due to all the moving parts that need to be in place there wasn‚Äôt enough time to organize an event like that. A week or so goes by and Eric gets a text from Patrick that says the band needs $5,000 to come play the show and Eric reminds him that is a huge chunk of change and they haven't even earned any money yet and Eric doesn't think it is a good idea but Patrick says that is what the Whitakers want. Eric didn't actually know if that is what the Whitaker's wanted or not because he never talked to them about it. Eric wrote him back and said that he is on a tight budget and doesn't think it is a good idea but if the Whitaker's want to do it then Patrick and the Whitakers can do it and if they need any advice they can ask Eric but he doesn't want to be involved with it or contribute to it. But if it makes money and it does good then the money that is made is all good and is between Patrick and the Whittakers. Patrick‚Äôs response was ey, forget it and Eric never heard anything more about it. Eric doesn't think the Whitakers wanted to pay $5,000 and were starting to be suspicious of Patrick and the discrepancies that were coming up. 

Eric opens up the panel to start taking questions. 
1.	Somebody asked how this is all believable and Dwayne responds that he had conversations with Eric about the stuff that was going on. Eric claims he has all the messages and he doesn't deal with hearsay. If he says something he can back it up. He says he's not stupid and wasn't born yesterday. He says truth is stranger than fiction in this story because it gets much deeper.
2.	Why did Eric stay doing this despite the red flags? Eric says because he didn't want to lose access to the Whitakers. He wanted to keep his eye on this thing. In the beginning when Patrick was truthful about stealing the tools, he wanted to believe that Patrick wanted to change and that he cared about Timmy in the beginning. In the beginning, Patrick was taking Timmy fishing, he was spending time with him that wasn't about money, and didn't ask to be sent money for anything, and was just spending quality time with him. Timmy was 46 years old and had spent most of his life sitting on the porch and Timmy was so appreciative of getting Patrick's attention. He thought to himself that if he could work on getting the money separated from Patrick as well as from himself they might be able to make this thing work. Eric didn't want to be near the money either, the trust, or anything. He reiterates that he was really hoping that Patrick would get better. He says on that first trip, the way that Lorraine and Ray took to him was special and the way Lorrain doesn't warm up to people the way that she did to him really got him. 
3.	Dwayne asked the question/ponders how much Eric wants to say because Eric says there's still a lot more things that occurred up to this point. Eric says that he is an open book. He says that Patrick spoke about Whitaker merchandise and tried to convince Eric that they could do that and not have to split any money doing with merchandise with the Whitakers. He says that Patrick never put that in a text message, that was just a conversation. Eric said that they couldn't sell Whitaker merchandise and keep the money, that is their, The Whitakers, money. He stated that people are not tuning into the Whitakers to see Patrick or Eric, they are mainly tuning in to see Lorraine, Ray, and Timmy mostly but Betty and Larry too. 
4.	Going back to the contracts and the fact that 100% of the donations were supposed to go to the Whitakers, was Patrick okay with that? Eric says Patrick didn't have a problem with that because Eric just told him that that is how it was going to be. Patrick did express a couple of times that basically Eric and Patrick needed to be looked out for as well. Eric reassured Patrick that once everything was set up, social media, the trust, that he was going to be just fine. He said he told Patrick that anything that was donated or any gifts that were received would go to the Whitakers. Eric said that any gifts that were given were sent to Patrick's house before they went to the Whitakers and everything was always opened before it got to the Whitakers. Eric threw a fit about that and was trying to open a PO Box to avoid that. He says the PO Box was an odd situation in Odd (the town) because the post office is attached to someone's personal house there. Patrick told Eric they couldn't have a post office box there, it wasn't allowed.
5.	Proceeds, who has funds, where those funds went‚Ä¶? Eric says that he has the Whitaker funds in his possession and he has told the authorities that he does because that money is ready to be put into a trust with the Amish for the Whitaker house as he had planned to do so the money could be overseen by the Amish committee. The reason Patrick sent the $5,000 to Eric that everyone has seen is because that was 2/3 of the money that they made for last month. He could only send so much in that one payment. When Eric tried to get the other part‚Ä¶ this is why the month before they made $3,000. That is what they got paid. Out of the three grand Eric had to go to Idaho and was up there a whole week working on a murder trial with Mr. Mash. But they got paid right before then and Patrick was holding that money for the Whitakers. Patrick took Betty and Lorraine to get their makeovers. Patrick told him that he was going to have to get reimbursed for some things and Eric said that was fine and understood it. Eric asked him how much and Patrick told him $1,500, and Eric went, what!?!?! He questioned Patrick and what he spent $1,500 on and Patrick told him not to flip out. Patrick claimed he was buying them all of their stuff and taking them to the grocery store. And Eric said what, $1,500 for the grocery store and snuff? I get it you took them to get a makeover but that should only cost $200 or $300. Patrick was handling the money for the Whitakers because the Whitakers aren't able to manage their money and they were supposed to be protecting that money. It was Eric's job to call out something if he felt that money was not being protected or going on with it. The next week Eric comes up, and there is supposed to be $1,500 left. He said Patrick told Eric that Eric was spending a lot of money personally and Patrick asked him if he needed some of that $1,500 and Eric said no. Eric took Ray and Larry out to get haircuts and clothes and then took them out to eat and did the same thing with Betty, Lorraine, and Timmy. He took them all to the movies. All of this was out of his own pocket. He approached Patrick because he felt like something was going on with that money. He says he recorded it all because his mom didn't raise a fool. Patrick asked Eric again if he wanted him to send the rest of the money and did but he only sent $1,000 instead of $1,500. He asked Patrick were the other $500 was. Still to this day he has not received an answer from Patrick about it. That $1,000 went to the $662 water bill that was caused by a running toilet. Larry turned off the toilet. The problem was caused by a broken floater and Eric bought Larry another one to install and it has never been replaced and it would only have taken 5 minutes to replace it which Larry was capable of doing but didn't. Larry was given two tablets by the water company that he was supposed to put in the back tank which would take 5 seconds to do and within 8 hours if the water turned blue then he would know if there was a water leak. And to this day that still has not been done. Then, Larry asked for one roll of snuff for him and one roll of snuff for Ray which Eric bought. After that the money that they had left, around $250 he put on a prepaid Visa debit card from Walgreens which he has a receipt for and gave it to Larry and Betty. Once he gave the card to Betty he told her that was the rest of the money and he was no longer in possession of any of their money and he didn't want possession of any of their money. But that $500 never showed back up that Patrick never gave Eric out of that $1,500. He said it plays into the story for later. When it comes into this month, when they pay that $5,000, Patrick gave the $5,000 and the other $2,500 never came to Eric. You have those two together and it comes to a total of $3,000 missing (personal note: I know this sounds confusing but it's written as Eric said it. This is important so I wanted to make sure I got it right). When that donation money came in (for the airbnb) people over sent and he told people to stop sending money and not to send him any more money. He said he begged and said he got what he needed for the air b&b. He said he would give whatever was left over to Patrick for sheetrock and insulation because Patrick needed sheetrock and insulation and he thought $4,000 was enough to sheetrock and insulate that place as he had walked around the place and sized it up for what it would mean. He sent Patrick $1,000 and told Patrick that $3,000 he had been begging Patrick to send him, to just keep it and then he was going to put the money in the trust. The rest of those donations that the people sent for the Airbnb, he was going to make sure the Whitaker's got the full amount of money for that month and put it in the trust and they would be good to go. Eric says he was trying to correct what Patrick had taken and to cover for him, not cover for him but he was cleaning up Patrick's mess and helping him out at the same time with the sheetrock and insulation. The plan quickly started becoming nothing about the Whitaker home as he wanted to fix up his own (Patrick‚Äôs) home and have the Whitakers live with him. Eric says he's not sure which would be more work to fix up - The Whitaker Home or Patrick's home. The Whitaker home is more dirty but they both are about an equal amount of work. Eric states that once they are done with this (video), he is done with all of this, updates and stuff. (Personal note: I don't know about anyone else but the money stuff still doesn't totally make sense to me, but maybe he addresses that later in more detail, I don't know. I haven't compared it yet to the screenshots I took earlier that he posted of the financials that were written in a notebook). 
6.	Has Eric had a chance to see any of the Whitakers since they were picked up by APS? Eric says no, they are a ward of the state now. He met the people that have them that were in the video because they were the people that came and met him because they were the ones that were supposed to meet with Betty when Betty no-showed. He says they are very good people and is sure that the Whitakers are being very well taken care of. They're just trying to make sure that the family is clean and taken care of. He is no fan of the system and has been talking about the system for a long time now. But, in this case he saw them go above and beyond and when he found out that Betty was offered a continuance on the protection order, Betty said no three times. They asked Betty again right before they came to pick the three Whitakers up, they were offering one more time to make sure, and Betty rejected it so they took the three Whitakers. Dwayne says it's weird because he watched Patrick's videos where Patrick says that Betty wanted BJ gone but then she says no three times to extending the protection order. And those two stories don't make sense and Eric says he has no idea who is telling the truth in this and he is tired of trying to figure it out. He only hopes that Ray, Timmy, and Lorraine are good and being taken care of because they are the innocent ones in this. They didn't have anything to do with any of this and their hearts were so happy and Eric loved doing things for Ray, Lorraine, and Timmy because unlike Betty and Larry when he did something for them they were so incredibly appreciative. Like when he gave Timmy the cup. Timmy gave those thank you hugs and Lorraine was the same way, she loved those potato chips. She got where she would hug Eric quite frequently. And then Ray ‚Ä¶ they loved and appreciated him and he didn't get that from the other side.
7.	Dwayne asks Eric if he had a chance to see that video of when APS picked them up? Eric says no he can't watch it but other people have told him about it (so how does he know it's the same people that he had previously met with that picked Timmy up from Patrick's house). He says he can't handle watching any videos with Patrick in it either. He says the Airbnb, groceries that he got for him, they just got done cleaning the Airbnb that took them 3 days‚Ä¶ his video kept breaking up so some things that he was saying were missed.
8.	Dwayne was asking about seeing the videos of the condo, the state that it was in when Patrick left. Eric says The video is a little fuzzy but people can see it. There was dog poop all over the walls. Some things you couldn't see but the biggest problem was the dip/the chew was everywhere‚Ä¶ in the sheets, the floor, everywhere. The doors were left completely wide open. When Patrick found out he couldn't stay, he took off a day early and went back home and that is when he went and got Timmy at that point. That is when Eric found out BJ was still there and Patrick went and got the cash cow (Timmy). Eric said dog turds were all over the floor and all over the deck. He said there was pills. Eric had to pay for the clean out. He was paid out through Thursday and he left Sunday. And Eric profusely told the owner to keep that money. 

At this point Eric circles back to the bluegrass concert where Patrick broke his leg. Eric is asking Patrick about the money and Patrick isn't talking to him. He was tired of Eric telling him that he needs to be accountable. Patrick was tired of Eric telling him that he needed to keep Eric in the loop about what was going on. Eric says he always tried to keep Patrick in the loop but he didn't have time to put every little thing on social media. He said he had five different platforms to keep rolling. Eric said that Patrick knew that he did not want that concert but the concert came across as here's Patrick Roark featuring the Whitakers. Patrick just went and did it and that is when he broke his leg. It infuriated Eric because Ray missed his follow-up orthopedic visit that Patrick was supposed to take him to. If Eric would have been there instead of at the Amish, Eric would have taken him. He said he made a trip up here to take Ray to that first appointment and all he needed Patrick to do was schedule an appointment for Ray. When he got here, this is during the time of the air conditioner stuff, Eric asked him if he got that appointment set up and Patrick told him that this is West Virginia, you can't just get an appointment set up like that. Eric asked him if he even called and Patrick said he didn't but he would get around to it. Well Eric was there and he wanted to get Ray to the knee doctor. Patrick kept telling Eric that he wasn't listening to him and he wouldn't be able to get him into the doctor. Eric called doctors in Beckley and they knew of Ray and the Whitakers and they had it set up for Eric to bring him in the next day to where Ray didn't need to be around everybody to keep him comfortable because they didn't know how Ray was going to handle the appointment and being around the doctor since he never goes to the doctor. Eric says that Ray is not in good shape and that Ray has lost a lot of weight. He says that Ray‚Äôs eyes do not look right and he has a curvature in his spine. He said the doctor's office went above and beyond. Eric says it took forever just to even find out what his birthday was to be able to get him in the system. He said he has no social security number, no birth certificate, no ID. The doctor was super nice and Ray was cooperative when the doctor first got in there it was a little touch and go when he was doing the pukse and blood pressure but Ray quickly warmed up to it. They prescribed him the Meloxicam and Voltran gel. The gel is now over the counter and it will have to be purchased. Eric did not have the money to buy it because he had already spent the money on the air conditioner and was left with almost no money (just that $100). He told Patrick about the prescription and the gel and Patrick said he would get it. Ray never got it until Eric came back for the very next visit. He went a month without the gel but he did get his meloxicam. The next day after getting the Meloxicam Ray was walking around the yard. Eric says he takes that too but it really did wonders for Ray. The doctor told Eric that they had spoken to an orthopedic doctor who is also going to make special accommodations for Ray and that he would be taking care of and he needed to go to that orthopedic visit. It was set up for them and it was missed because Patrick didn't take Ray and went to the concert where he got his leg broke instead. 

He brings up seeing video of Timmy rubbing Patrick's feet and Patrick bringing up taking Timmy skydiving, which he hasn't done yet and probably won't. He also talks about Timmy hanging from a rope in a tree. Even brings up seeing videos where Patrick is bugging Betty about giving him a kiss. Betty went to kiss him in one of the videos and Patrick says no Betty I'm playing with you. He says you could see the hurt look on Betty's face and Eric was mad for Patrick leading her on for everyone to see and said there was comments on that video that weren't good. Patrick got furious about it over text messages. Eric says he had to boil it down for Patrick and said this is a family that was picked on their whole life, are outcasts to society, nobody ever spent much time with them, Patrick is showing up and spending so much time on Timmy, took him to eat and did things with him. Betty never had kids and never got married, there came a time and Betty didn't think he was playing around anymore. He says that the give me a kiss thing stopped because‚Ä¶ 

Dwayne brings up videos about people commenting about Timmy being in bed with Eric. He said he told APS about that right away. There was one night when they were watching E.T. and Timmy came into the room with a pillow and cover and wanted to get in the bed with Eric. He says Timmy has slept in the bed with his mother his whole life. Eric said no Timmy there's a bunk bed in the other room. Timmy didn't care and hopped up on the bed anyway. Eric told Timmy numerous times that he needed to go back into the other bedroom but wanted to be in there with Eric. Eric thought long and hard about it. He looked and saw that Timmy was underneath the comforter and sheet in the bed and Eric went and got another comforter from one of the other bedrooms. He slept on top of the comforter that Timmy was under using the comforter from the other bedroom to cover up with and stayed fully clothed obviously. Dwayne brings up the video with Timmy in the bed with Patrick in his underwear. He says that Timmy deserved to spend time with Eric watching movies in the bed because Timmy never had a dad. Eric says he'll never forget that week, week and a half he got to spend with Timmy and he feels like he made a big difference in Timmy's life, with things that we take for granted that Timmy didn't.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Giants vs. Diamondbacks: A Tale of Two Pitchers and a Sleepy Fan‚Äôs Dream**

The San Francisco Giants (73-71) and Arizona Diamondbacks (72-73) collide on September 9, 2025, in a wild-card playoff race that‚Äôs tighter than a knotted shoelace. Let‚Äôs break down this matchup with the precision of a stathead and the wit of a late-night host who‚Äôs had one too many cups of coffee.

---

### Parse the Odds: Pitchers, Power, and Porous Defenses

The Giants‚Äô Robbie Ray (10-6, 3.31 ERA) is the star of the show, but his last start was a leaky faucet: 4‚Öî innings, four earned runs, seven hits. Still, he‚Äôs got 171 strikeouts in 168‚Öî innings‚Äîenough to make a math teacher blush. Meanwhile, Arizona‚Äôs Zac Gallen (11-13, 4.77 ERA) is riding a three-start scoreless streak, looking like a magician who‚Äôs learned to make batters disappear. His recent seven-start stretch? A 2.20 ERA and 5-2 record. If Gallen‚Äôs been this good lately, why does he still have an ERA north of 4.77? Maybe he‚Äôs been battling a time-traveling version of himself.

The Giants‚Äô offense is a slugger‚Äôs paradise: 21 home runs in their last 10 games, led by Rafael Devers (.346 in two weeks, 6 HRs). Devers is 2-4 against Gallen, but let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîthis man hits like he‚Äôs been training in a parallel universe where gravity is optional. The Diamondbacks? They‚Äôre hitting .226 in their last 10, with Corbin Carroll‚Äôs three HRs feeling like a cruel April Fools‚Äô joke.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Streaks, and a Sleepy Fan‚Äôs Nightmare

The Giants‚Äô bullpen is the second-best in MLB (3.32 ERA), which is impressive considering their closer once fell asleep during a save situation and woke up to a standing ovation. Arizona‚Äôs offense? A .384 slugging percentage in their last 10 games‚Äîabout as exciting as a spreadsheet.

Key prop alert: Devers is a .267 hitter against righties with a .916 OPS. Gallen, meanwhile, has allowed 26 HRs this season but just one in h

I accompanied my ex through his father's passing away and our relationship was full of intense emotions the whole time even though were were only together for 2.5 years. he broke up with me for the last time and didn't hear back from him for a few months, and after he came back looking for me I had moved on and decided i no longer wants this level of drama. the last thing i said to him was ""if we are 70 years old and we meet again by chance, we can have a coffee and talk about how these years went"". and i actually meant it when i said that. but sometime i look back and felt like those few years were surreal and like it was a movie, with all those poeple and those places and those things we experienced together and they were all gone. The city I lived in also gone through significant gentrification and almost all the places we used to go to went out of business, and places changed, the only thing that didn't change much was my parents house. he's also my first long term bf and i married my husband who was my 2nd long term relationship.

I guess there's just a sense of ""saudade‚Äú sometimes and I never really had anyone to tell that to. it's also weird to know that I used to know someone so intimately well in their private life in the corner of another continent that I probably won't visit ever again unless i intentionally choose to which I won't. his mother and cousins and I still follow each other, though he doesn't use social media and I don't really post anything of my life anymore. so we don't see each other's lives but i do still have this weird continuation of still in the loops of his family's lives from afar. its a weird disconnect and continuition of our past and future thanks to the internet.

1nd4wsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nd4wsa/unperson/,Unperson,"I never thought much of my job as a journalist, just a way to pay the bills and do what I love. Writing and research. Digging deep into topics and people, finding all the details and secrets, then writing and bringing them to the public has always been the dream. Even if it is just for an online news site. I usually wrote about the same mundane things. Different viral crazes, updating the world on the latest gossip about celebrities I couldn't care less about, even the boring side of politics. So when I woke up with a pain in my neck like no other and¬†saw a file labeled*The Blank List*¬†tossed onto my desk my curiosity did what any sane persons would, and rose until the shiver going down my spine shocked me back to reality waking me up in no time.¬†

I grabbed the ominous folder feeling the weight it carried with it. I hadn‚Äôt even opened the folder and I could tell this was going to be something different than anything I had ever reported on. None the less it was just another assignment that could wait until tomorrow to start. I slid the folder into my bag along with my laptop and headed out of the office. As I walked to the bus stop I could feel the weight difference in my bag, but decided to chalk it up to the lack of sleep I‚Äôve had the past few days trying to catch up and finish my last article before it was due. I lugged the heavier than usual bag onto the bus and sat down as close to the door as possible struggling to stay awake. I just wanted off that bus as fast as I could, and into my bed to finally relax and end the day.

As the bus slowly came to a stop I gathered all my belongings and proceeded towards my apartment. ‚ÄúGod I need sleep‚Äù I muttered to myself as I fumbled with my keys trying to get my door unlocked. As I stepped into the living room I dropped my bag by the door and tossed my keys onto the counter, kicked off my shoes and headed straight to my bed. I curled up under the blanket, closing my eyes. A few hours passed and I was awake staring at the ceiling fan above me. As the blades spun round and round all that was on my mind was that folder. Sighing I flung my legs out of bed and walked back out to the rest of the apartment. ‚ÄúJesus I left the lights on?‚Äù I asked myself as I grabbed my bag from against the wall.¬†

The bag was definitely lighter. ‚ÄúI was more tired than I thought‚Äù I said to myself as I opened the bag and sifted through its contents looking for the folder from earlier. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre in here‚Äù I groggily mumbled, still searching for the folder. I looked up with frustration just trying to catch a break for a moment when something on the table caught my eye. I dropped the bag and slowly walked to the table. I stopped a foot away from the table with an anxious feeling creeping through my skin and still stiff and sleepy body jolting me awake. There was the folder, waiting for me.¬†

I stood in shock staring at the tan folder. I could have swore I had left it in the bag. ‚ÄúMaybe.. I just don‚Äôt remember moving it‚Äù I try convincing myself. ‚ÄúYeah that must be it.‚Äù I step closer and take a seat right in front of the folder. Still a bit anxious, I forced myself to open it fearing what may be waiting for me inside. One single paper with the title¬†*‚ÄúThe Blank List‚Äù*¬†and VERY little information staring back at me.¬†

A feeling of relief rushed over me. ‚ÄúJust another assignment‚Äù I said to myself. Looking closer at the paper the information seemed like definitely not enough to just write a quick story, but nothing I couldn‚Äôt handle. The information was in crude handwriting. A link to a website, a list of names with a short bio on each name, and the location of where each individual resides. Ten names being listed in chronological order, three with the word ‚ÄúDECEASED‚Äù written in red ink next to them. ‚ÄúGuess they won't be available for an interview.‚Äù

I grab the laptop from my bag and quickly type the link into the search browser. The laptop screen began glitching for a few seconds then turned pitch black. What felt like minutes passed before the screen lit back up showing a dark message board. I scroll up looking at past messages trying to figure out what I am looking at. I recognized one of the names immediately, as it was first on the list in the folder. Soon realizing that all the members in the chat were on my paper. Every. Single. One.¬†

The chats go back several years all about the same topic, being erased from existence. I decided to start with the first name, Michelle W. Michelle claimed she used to be a well-known tech CEO. Stating how slowly she was forgotten by even those who loved her. I googled her name on my phone but no one came up. ‚ÄúI swear if this is just some joke or conspiracy‚Äù I say, getting increasingly frustrated. I begin to type into the message board asking if anyone would like to meet up to discuss this phenomenon, explaining that I am doing a story on their experiences for the news.¬†

As I press send I notice my name at the top of the message. ‚ÄúEric D.‚Äù I never put my name into the website. Before I have time to wonder about how the website got my name a ping rang from the computer. ‚ÄúMeet me at this location at 10:00 am tomorrow.‚Äù read back at me with a set of coordinates attached below. I quickly jotted down the numbers and went back to respond, but the message board was already closed, and all that stared back at me was a blank screen. I shut my laptop and sat for a moment staring at the small but seemingly important pile of information in front of me. ‚ÄúGuess I should try and get more sleep..‚Äù I said as I walked back towards my room. A mixture of anxiety, tiredness, and doubt sat heavy in my chest. But all that could wait until tomorrow, for now all I could do was rest.¬†

Ten came around and there I was, my bag slung across my back, standing alone like an idiot in front of a coffee shop. ‚ÄúReally? A coffee shop? What is this, a movie?‚Äù I ask myself as I check the coordinates one last time confirming I was correct. Suddenly a hand finds itself on my shoulder and pulls me into the nearest alley. A woman about three inches shorter than me stares back. ‚ÄúShh, I know this is weird but we have to speak in private.‚Äù she said as she grabbed my hand and led me towards a door down the alley. ‚ÄúHey Hey Hey. I don‚Äôt even know you, I‚Äôm not following a stranger.‚Äù I said as I pulled my hand away and stood my ground. ‚ÄúEric‚Äù I shudder as she says my name. ‚ÄúYou asked to meet, and I agreed.‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMichelle?‚Äù I asked, only receiving a nod in response. She stuck her hand back out and against my better judgement I took it and followed her.¬†

As we stepped into the dark damp building I felt a strange sense of calm. Like I knew this stranger wasn‚Äôt going to harm me. Michelle led me to a small room with a couch and old television. She flicked a light on and I found a spot on the couch to sit down. I pulled out a notebook and pen so I could take down notes and answers from questions I was ready to ask. Before I could get a word out Michelle spoke. ‚ÄúAre you being erased too? Why is the news now just worried about us? What are you going to say? Will you help us?‚Äù She spouted out so many questions it was hard to keep up. When she finally stopped to breathe I took my chance to explain.¬†

‚ÄúMy name is Eric, I work for a private online news company. A folder was placed on my desk containing names of people and not much else.‚Äù I handed her the file and continued speaking. ‚ÄúI was wanting more information on what all is going on so I could write an article about it. Who are you and what is your story?‚Äù Michelle sat in silence for a moment as if she had to really think about what to say. ‚ÄúI used to be a CEO for a tech firm. I was famous in the tech world, making revolutionary products to further the advancement of medical research. Slowly pieces of my existence started to disappear. It started with the search engines. No one could search anything about me. At first I thought it was just someone trying to pull a prank but then I tried to search for myself at home and nothing came up. As if I didn‚Äôt exist. Then all my social media disappeared after a while. Then the bank had no idea who I was. Even scanning my license brought up nothing. My landlord kicked me out because he thought I was a squatter. And my own mother denied having children. It was like I vanished, not just from the world but from the memories of everyone as well.‚Äù¬†

Michelle sat staring at her hands in her lap, choking back the tears forming in her eyes. I wrote down everything trying to process the information I just heard. As sad as it was, I was skeptical. There is no way a person could just vanish, especially in this day and age. This had to be a joke, or some conspiracy. A group of people who had a shitty upcoming pretending to have something else. A way to put their failures on someone else. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that.‚Äù I said trying to fake concern I definitely did not have. ‚ÄúI wish you luck Eric.‚Äù Michelle said quietly. ‚ÄúI know you don‚Äôt believe me. I can see it in your eyes. But good luck finding anyone else.. No one else has been active on the website in days.‚Äù I thanked her for her time and gathered my things. Part of me feeling bad for not believing her. ‚ÄúHere is my number‚Äù I say, handing her a card before leaving. ‚ÄúCall if you need anything.‚Äù Michelle nods and I exit the building. Part of me felt guilty, but logically there was no way anything like this could happen. I shook the thoughts out of my head and walked out of the alley back to the busy street to head home.¬†

It's been about five hours since the interview and all I feel is annoyed as I‚Äôm typing the beginning draft of my article. Michelle was right though, I haven‚Äôt been able to contact anyone else on the list. I keep refreshing the message board but nothing has changed since mine and Michelle‚Äôs last chat. ‚ÄúAnother piece on people losing their minds, just what the world needs.‚Äù I say to myself as I continue to type. My stomach is GROWLING at this point. It felt like ages since I last ate. I got up to grab something from the fridge. ‚ÄúLeft overs. The staple of this household.‚Äù I say as I pop the plastic container in the microwave. As I turn back with the hot plastic bowl of radiation heated noodles I'm stopped dead in my tracks. I drop the food making a mess that I will most likely regret not cleaning up right away.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?!‚Äù I say rushing to the laptop on the table. ‚ÄúWhere did it all go?!‚Äù I panicked by pressing every button I could think of to refresh the page but it was no use. It was all gone. I angrily dug through my bag grabbing the notebook to start over, not even worrying about the mess. I was not going to be behind on another article as well as sleep. As I flipped through the pages of the notebook I noticed they too were empty. ‚ÄúThis can NOT be happening.‚Äù I say flipping back and forth between all the pages trying to make sense of it all. ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù I ask, feeling defeated and angry all at once. I tried contacting Michelle again but with no luck. It was like she had vanished. Flashbacks of our talk earlier had begun to creep into my mind. I shook them away knowing I was just paranoid. It was late and maybe I had misplaced things and my computer had rebooted or something. That was the only reasonable explanation I could think of.¬†

I sent a text to my editor asking for more information on the¬†*‚ÄúThe Blank List‚Äù*¬†assignment, not expecting a text until the next morning. My phone pinged almost instantly, ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù he had responded. The color drained from my face reading the text. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you put the folder on my desk?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù is what I received back. My chest was pounding now. This is the same guy I have known my entire career. ‚ÄúThis has to be a joke.‚Äù I say trying to calm my nerves. My laptop pings. My eyes bolt to the screen to see a new message. It was an unknown user on the message board. ‚ÄúI tried to warn you.‚Äù the message read. ‚ÄúMichelle?‚Äù I ask back, but receive no response. In fact, all the names were gone. Every message typed with the name ‚Äúunknown‚Äù. This was really starting to creep me out. ‚ÄúFuck this, I‚Äôm going to bed.‚Äù I said, still feeling defeated and a bit angry.

It was the next day and as you guessed, nothing was getting better. All of my social media had disappeared it seemed. When I tried logging in, everything was denied. Not even my security questions were coming up as correct. I decided to take a walk to clear my head, maybe get a coffee to make me feel better. As I walked down the street a familiar face caught my eye. It was Michelle. I run towards her eager to speak with her once more, but when I reach her, she has no idea who I am. At this point I‚Äôm starting to believe her story was more than an elaborate plot to pin her shortcomings on someone else. Maybe.. It was all real. I ran straight to my office grabbing my badge that I always had with me, trying to enter the building. Security immediately stopped me, not recognizing me at all.¬†

Security said they had no one employed at this facility under that name and confiscated my badge and tossed me out of the building. Just like that, seven years of being at that company down the drain. ‚ÄúThis is a dream. This isn‚Äôt real.‚Äù I kept telling myself as I walked back home. I tried calling my mom who I hadn‚Äôt spoken with in years since she kicked me out for wanting to be a journalist instead of a doctor. All she said was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know an Eric, please stop calling me.‚Äù and hung up. I had no siblings or significant other, not even any friends to try and contact. That‚Äôs what I get for being a recluse I suppose. I get home and my key doesn‚Äôt fit the lock. I am now in full panic mode. All of my things, my entire life was being stripped away from me.¬†

I broke the window to the apartment and climbed in, grabbing everything I could think of as important to me. I hear sirens down the street and an angry landlord screaming at me from just outside to get the hell out. I sprinted to the only place I could think, the dingy place in the alley. An hour passes and I‚Äôm finally in the alley. Out of breath I take a chance and try to open the door. To my surprise it was unlocked. I walked in and everything looked the same as before. Cold, dark, and damp. I lock the door behind me and hit the lights, set my things down and walk to the same uncomfortable couch that I sat on not even forty eight hours ago.¬†

My entire life has been turned upside down in just seventy two hours. I set my laptop up on the small table in front of the couch and logged into the message board. ‚ÄúIf anyone is seeing this, I believe you. It is all real, we are all real.‚Äù I send the message to the chat and pray someone sees it. No response. I pull the list of names out of my bag and look at it one last time, noticing a new name was on the list. Mine. Just like that, I became an unperson.¬†

I woke up at my desk, a pain in my neck like no other. When I looked around I saw a file on my desk. It was labeled¬†*‚ÄúThe Blank List‚Äù.*",2,1757478944.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I'd heard there's a short story about Coral and her pregnancy in the ""Shadow Knight"" supplement for the DRPG. I've skimmed through it a few times and don't see a short story, though.

  
What I *do* see is an incorrect quote from ""Prince of Chaos.""

  
""You've got coffee here?""

""I require it, man. This way."" He led us out the door, turned left, headed down a stair. ""By the way, Coral seems to be a little bit pregnant, and she says it's yours.""

I choked slightly.

""Uh... I can explain that, Luke...""

  
The actual quote is:

‚ÄúCome on. I‚Äôll buy you a cup of coffee,‚Äù Luke said. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got coffee here?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI require it, man. This way.‚Äù He led us out the door, turned left, headed down a stair. 

‚ÄúI had a funny thought,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwhile you were talking back there ‚Äî about you reigning, and Coral a desirable queen. I could get the marriage annulled pretty damn quick, since I‚Äôm in charge here. Now, you want her for your queen and I want that Golden Circle Treaty with Amber. I think I see a way to make everybody happy.‚Äù

  
I double checked because 1) I did not remember that bit of dialog from the novel and 2) the inserted dialog just really doesn't feel like Zelazny.

  
Is that insert meant to be the ""short story""? There's excerpts from ""the Salesman's Tale.""

  
I know the DRPG material isn't official canon, Zelazny wasn't super involved with it, but there ARE excepts from ""Salesman's Tale"" and Zelazny DID consult.

  
I don't remember her conclusively being pregnant during previous rereads of the novel - it's heavily implied (why else would the Pattern demand they have sex?) but there's no ""lol she's knocked up"" big reveal that I remember. Am I remembering wrong?

  
Is there an actual short story discussing what happens with her?

I guess there's just a sense of ""saudade‚Äú sometimes and I never really had anyone to tell that to. it's also weird to know that I used to know someone so intimately well in their private life in the corner of another continent that I probably won't visit ever again unless i intentionally choose to which I won't. his mother and cousins and I still follow each other, though he doesn't use social media and I don't really post anything of my life anymore. so we don't see each other's lives but i do still have this weird continuation of still in the loops of his family's lives from afar. its a weird disconnect and continuition of our past and future thanks to the internet.",2,1757478916.0,CasualConversation,3,0.67,False

1nd4vua,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Greedy-Repair-5201/comments/1nd4vua/unperson/,Unperson,"I never thought much of my job as a journalist, just a way to pay the bills and do what I love. Writing and research. Digging deep into topics and people, finding all the details and secrets, then writing and bringing them to the public has always been the dream. Even if it is just for an online news site. I usually wrote about the same mundane things. Different viral crazes, updating the world on the latest gossip about celebrities I couldn't care less about, even the boring side of politics. So when I woke up with a pain in my neck and¬† saw a file labeled *The Blank List* tossed onto my desk my curiosity did what any sane persons would, and rose until the shiver going down my spine shocked me back to reality waking me up in no time.¬†

I grabbed the ominous folder feeling the weight it carried with it. I hadn‚Äôt even opened the folder and I could tell this was going to be something different than anything I had ever reported on. None the less it was just another assignment that could wait until tomorrow to start. I slid the folder into my bag along with my laptop and headed out of the office. As I walked to the bus stop I could feel the weight difference in my bag, but decided to chalk it up to the lack of sleep I‚Äôve had the past few days trying to catch up and finish my last article before it was due. I lugged the heavier than usual bag onto the bus and sat down as close to the door as possible struggling to stay awake. I just wanted off that bus as fast as I could, and into my bed to finally relax and end the day.

As the bus slowly came to a stop I gathered all my belongings and proceeded towards my apartment. ‚ÄúGod I need sleep‚Äù I muttered to myself as I fumbled with my keys trying to get my door unlocked. As I stepped into the living room I dropped my bag by the door and tossed my keys onto the counter, kicked off my shoes and headed straight to my bed. I curled up under the blanket, closing my eyes. A few hours passed and I was awake staring at the ceiling fan above me. As the blades spun round and round all that was on my mind was that folder. Sighing I flung my legs out of bed and walked back out to the rest of the apartment. ‚ÄúJesus I left the lights on?‚Äù I asked myself as I grabbed my bag from against the wall.¬†

The bag was definitely lighter. ‚ÄúI was more tired than I thought‚Äù I said to myself as I opened the bag and sifted through its contents looking for the folder from earlier. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre in here‚Äù I groggily mumbled, still searching for the folder. I looked up with frustration just trying to catch a break for a moment when something on the table caught my eye. I dropped the bag and slowly walked to the table. I stopped a foot away from the table with an anxious feeling creeping through my skin and still stiff and sleepy body jolting me awake. There was the folder, waiting for me.¬†

 I stood in shock staring at the tan folder. I could have swore I had left it in the bag. ‚ÄúMaybe.. I just don‚Äôt remember moving it‚Äù I try convincing myself. ‚ÄúYeah that must be it.‚Äù I step closer and take a seat right in front of the folder. Still a bit anxious, I forced myself to open it fearing what may be waiting for me inside. One single paper with the title *‚ÄúThe Blank List‚Äù* and VERY little information staring back at me.¬†

 A feeling of relief rushed over me. ‚ÄúJust another assignment‚Äù I said to myself. Looking closer at the paper the information seemed like definitely not enough to just write a quick story, but nothing I couldn‚Äôt handle. The information was in crude handwriting. A link to a website, a list of names with a short bio on each name, and the location of where each individual resides. Ten names being listed in chronological order, three with the word ‚ÄúDECEASED‚Äù written in red ink next to them. ‚ÄúGuess they won't be available for an interview.‚Äù

I grab the laptop from my bag and quickly type the link into the search browser. The laptop screen began glitching for a few seconds then turned pitch black. What felt like minutes passed before the screen lit back up showing a dark message board. I scroll up looking at past messages trying to figure out what I am looking at. I recognized one of the names immediately, as it was first on the list in the folder. Soon realizing that all the members in the chat were on my paper. Every. Single. One.¬†

The chats go back several years all about the same topic, being erased from existence. I decided to start with the first name, Michelle W. Michelle claimed she used to be a well-known tech CEO. Stating how slowly she was forgotten by even those who loved her. I googled her name on my phone but no one came up. ‚ÄúI swear if this is just some joke or conspiracy‚Äù I say, getting increasingly frustrated. I begin to type into the message board asking if anyone would like to meet up to discuss this phenomenon, explaining that I am doing a story on their experiences for the news.¬†

As I press send I notice my name at the top of the message. ‚ÄúEric D.‚Äù I never put my name into the website. Before I have time to wonder about how the website got my name a ping rang from the computer. ‚ÄúMeet me at this location at 10:00 am tomorrow.‚Äù read back at me with a set of coordinates attached below. I quickly jotted down the numbers and went back to respond, but the message board was already closed, and all that stared back at me was a blank screen. I shut my laptop and sat for a moment staring at the small but seemingly important pile of information in front of me. ‚ÄúGuess I should try and get more sleep..‚Äù I said as I walked back towards my room. A mixture of anxiety, tiredness, and doubt sat heavy in my chest. But all that could wait until tomorrow, for now all I could do was rest.¬†

Ten came around and there I was, my bag slung across my back, standing alone like an idiot in front of a coffee shop. ‚ÄúReally? A coffee shop? What is this, a movie?‚Äù I ask myself as I check the coordinates one last time confirming I was correct. Suddenly a hand finds itself on my shoulder and pulls me into the nearest alley. A woman about three inches shorter than me stares back. ‚ÄúShh, I know this is weird but we have to speak in private.‚Äù she said as she grabbed my hand and led me towards a door down the alley. ‚ÄúHey Hey Hey. I don‚Äôt even know you, I‚Äôm not following a stranger.‚Äù I said as I pulled my hand away and stood my ground. ‚ÄúEric‚Äù I shudder as she says my name. ‚ÄúYou asked to meet, and I agreed.‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMichelle?‚Äù I asked, only receiving a nod in response. She stuck her hand back out and against my better judgement I took it and followed her.¬†

As we stepped into the dark damp building I felt a strange sense of calm. Like I knew this stranger wasn‚Äôt going to harm me. Michelle led me to a small room with a couch and old television. She flicked a light on and I found a spot on the couch to sit down. I pulled out a notebook and pen so I could take down notes and answers from questions I was ready to ask. Before I could get a word out Michelle spoke. ‚ÄúAre you being erased too? Why is the news now just worried about us? What are you going to say? Will you help us?‚Äù She spouted out so many questions it was hard to keep up. When she finally stopped to breathe I took my chance to explain.¬†

‚ÄúMy name is Eric, I work for a private online news company. A folder was placed on my desk containing names of people and not much else.‚Äù I handed her the file and continued speaking. ‚ÄúI was wanting more information on what all is going on so I could write an article about it. Who are you and what is your story?‚Äù Michelle sat in silence for a moment as if she had to really think about what to say. ‚ÄúI used to be a CEO for a tech firm. I was famous in the tech world, making revolutionary products to further the advancement of medical research. Slowly pieces of my existence started to disappear. It started with the search engines. No one could search anything about me. At first I thought it was just someone trying to pull a prank but then I tried to search for myself at home and nothing came up. As if I didn‚Äôt exist. Then all my social media disappeared after a while. Then the bank had no idea who I was. Even scanning my license brought up nothing. My landlord kicked me out because he thought I was a squatter. And my own mother denied having children. It was like I vanished, not just from the world but from the memories of everyone as well.‚Äù¬†

Michelle sat staring at her hands in her lap, choking back the tears forming in her eyes. I wrote down everything trying to process the information I just heard. As sad as it was, I was skeptical. There is no way a person could just vanish, especially in this day and age. This had to be a joke, or some conspiracy. A group of people who had a shitty upcoming pretending to have something else. A way to put their failures on someone else. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that.‚Äù I said trying to fake concern I definitely did not have. ‚ÄúI wish you luck Eric.‚Äù Michelle said quietly. ‚ÄúI know you don‚Äôt believe me. I can see it in your eyes. But good luck finding anyone else.. No one else has been active on the website in days.‚Äù I thanked her for her time and gathered my things. Part of me feeling bad for not believing her. ‚ÄúHere is my number‚Äù I say, handing her a card before leaving. ‚ÄúCall if you need anything.‚Äù Michelle nods and I exit the building. Part of me felt guilty, but logically there was no way anything like this could happen. I shook the thoughts out of my head and walked out of the alley back to the busy street to head home.¬†

It's been about five hours since the interview and all I feel is annoyed as I‚Äôm typing the beginning draft of my article. Michelle was right though, I haven‚Äôt been able to contact anyone else on the list. I keep refreshing the message board but nothing has changed since mine and Michelle‚Äôs last chat. ‚ÄúAnother piece on people losing their minds, just what the world needs.‚Äù I say to myself as I continue to type. My stomach is GROWLING at this point. It felt like ages since I last ate. I got up to grab something from the fridge. ‚ÄúLeft overs. The staple of this household.‚Äù I say as I pop the plastic container in the microwave. As I turn back with the hot plastic bowl of radiation heated noodles I'm stopped dead in my tracks. I drop the food making a mess that I will most likely regret not cleaning up right away.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?!‚Äù I say rushing to the laptop on the table. ‚ÄúWhere did it all go?!‚Äù I panicked by pressing every button I could think of to refresh the page but it was no use. It was all gone. I angrily dug through my bag grabbing the notebook to start over, not even worrying about the mess. I was not going to be behind on another article as well as sleep. As I flipped through the pages of the notebook I noticed they too were empty. ‚ÄúThis can NOT be happening.‚Äù I say flipping back and forth between all the pages trying to make sense of it all. ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù I ask, feeling defeated and angry all at once. I tried contacting Michelle again but with no luck. It was like she had vanished. Flashbacks of our talk earlier had begun to creep into my mind. I shook them away knowing I was just paranoid. It was late and maybe I had misplaced things and my computer had rebooted or something. That was the only reasonable explanation I could think of.¬†

I sent a text to my editor asking for more information on the *‚ÄúThe Blank List‚Äù* assignment, not expecting a text until the next morning. My phone pinged almost instantly, ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù he had responded. The color drained from my face reading the text. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you put the folder on my desk?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù is what I received back. My chest was pounding now. This is the same guy I have known my entire career. ‚ÄúThis has to be a joke.‚Äù I say trying to calm my nerves. My laptop pings. My eyes bolt to the screen to see a new message. It was an unknown user on the message board. ‚ÄúI tried to warn you.‚Äù the message read. ‚ÄúMichelle?‚Äù I ask back, but receive no response. In fact, all the names were gone. Every message typed with the name ‚Äúunknown‚Äù. This was really starting to creep me out. ‚ÄúFuck this, I‚Äôm going to bed.‚Äù I said, still feeling defeated and a bit angry.

It was the next day and as you guessed, nothing was getting better. All of my social media had disappeared it seemed. When I tried logging in, everything was denied. Not even my security questions were coming up as correct. I decided to take a walk to clear my head, maybe get a coffee to make me feel better. As I walked down the street a familiar face caught my eye. It was Michelle. I run towards her eager to speak with her once more, but when I reach her, she has no idea who I am. At this point I‚Äôm starting to believe her story was more than an elaborate plot to pin her shortcomings on someone else. Maybe.. It was all real. I ran straight to my office grabbing my badge that I always had with me, trying to enter the building. Security immediately stopped me, not recognizing me at all.¬†

Security said they had no one employed at this facility under that name and confiscated my badge and tossed me out of the building. Just like that, seven years of being at that company down the drain. ‚ÄúThis is a dream. This isn‚Äôt real.‚Äù I kept telling myself as I walked back home. I tried calling my mom who I hadn‚Äôt spoken with in years since she kicked me out for wanting to be a journalist instead of a doctor. All she said was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know an Eric, please stop calling me.‚Äù and hung up. I had no siblings or significant other, not even any friends to try and contact. That‚Äôs what I get for being a recluse I suppose. I get home and my key doesn‚Äôt fit the lock. I am now in full panic mode. All of my things, my entire life was being stripped away from me.¬†

I broke the window to the apartment and climbed in, grabbing everything I could think of as important to me. I hear sirens down the street and an angry landlord screaming at me from just outside to get the hell out. I sprinted to the only place I could think, the dingy place in the alley. An hour passes and I‚Äôm finally in the alley. Out of breath I take a chance and try to open the door. To my surprise it was unlocked. I walked in and everything looked the same as before. Cold, dark, and damp. I lock the door behind me and hit the lights, set my things down and walk to the same uncomfortable couch that I sat on not even forty eight hours ago.¬†

My entire life has been turned upside down in just seventy two hours. I set my laptop up on the small table in front of the couch and logged into the message board. ‚ÄúIf anyone is seeing this, I believe you. It is all real, we are all real.‚Äù I send the message to the chat and pray someone sees it. No response. I pull the list of names out of my bag and look at it one last time, noticing a new name was on the list. Mine. Just like that, I became an unperson.¬†

I woke up at my desk, a pain in my neck like no other. When I looked around I saw a file on my desk. It was labeled *‚ÄúThe Blank List‚Äù.*",1,1757478856.0,u_Greedy-Repair-5201,0,1.0,False

Sadie looked surprised. ""For me? Oh my gosh, Cruz, you didn't have to.""

She tore into it with a dramatic gasp, pulling out the Steve Madden bag I'd dreamed about.

I blinked.

Cruz looked at me, confusion flickering across his face, then rising like a tide.

""That's not right,"" he said, voice low.

Sadie laughed. ""Well, that's what the tag said. It had my name on it.""

Cruz leaned toward me, whispering, ""That was yours. I swear, that was yours.""

I turned to him, barely moving my lips. ""Well, tell her then."" My voice cracked, low but sharp. He hesitated again, eyes bouncing between me and the bag. I took a breath, the ache in my chest blooming.

""I don't want to make a scene,"" he muttered.

Of course he didn't.

The route of least resistance. Again.

""Then I'll exit the scene,"" I whispered. I stood slowly, heart pounding, and walked toward the hallway without another word.

I didn't belong here‚Äînot where I had to beg to be seen. Not where someone could steal a gift meant for me and the person I loved would let it happen.

Ember's POV

Moving to South Louisiana felt like standing at the edge of a diving board, heart pounding, unsure if the water below would be warm or ice-cold. The air was thick with the scent of cypress and something unfamiliar-maybe excitement, maybe fear, maybe both. Cruz and I had just hauled the last of the boxes into our small rental house nestled near the bayou. The cicadas were already singing their lazy tune as if announcing the start of a new season, a new life.

We were finally here. After years in Dallas-me teaching kindergarten and Cruz working long hours under big-name architects-we were taking the leap. He was stepping into his dad's shoes, running the family construction business, and I'd landed a job at the local elementary school.

Everything about this move felt fragile and monumental all at once. The town. The house. The people. But the biggest leap of all was Cruz. Trusting in the man I'd loved so fiercely since college. He was the golden retriever to my sunshower-warm, loyal, endlessly optimistic. He'd proposed a year ago in the park where we had our first picnic, kneeling in the grass with that crooked smile and too much hope in his eyes. I said yes without a blink. I meant it.

And yet, as I stood in our new kitchen surrounded by half-unpacked boxes, chipped counters, and the quiet hum of crickets outside, a sharp ache clawed at my chest.

""I still can't believe we're really here,"" Cruz said, stepping up behind me and wrapping his arms around my waist. His familiar warmth enveloped me, and his peck to the top of my head was feather-light, reverent.

""I know,"" I murmured, trying to steady my breath. ""It feels... big.""

He turned me in his arms, concern in those honey-brown eyes. ""You okay?""

I hesitated, then nodded. ""I think so."" My voice trembled, betraying me. ""It's just... a lot. New place. New job. New people. It's exciting, but also kinda terrifying.""

His brow furrowed. ""We don't have to do this if you're not ready.""

I shook my head quickly, almost desperately. ""No, Cruz. I want this. I want us. I just..."" My throat thickened as I looked around the kitchen, the shadows long from the late afternoon sun. ""I've always been the girl who had her roots. And now I've pulled them up and replanted them somewhere completely different.""

He gently tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. ""You're not alone,"" he said, his voice low and grounding. ""We're doing this together. And if at any point it gets too much, we figure it out-together.""

Tears burned behind my eyes, and I blinked fast, not wanting them to fall. Cruz always knew how to anchor me-how to make the storm inside me feel less like a threat and more like a passing summer rain.

That's what always drew me to him. He didn't just love with words-he loved with actions. With the way he made my coffee just right. The way he always double-knotted my sneakers before a walk. The way he looked at me like I was the only thing that ever made sense.

Still, that night, lying in bed beside him in our unfamiliar room, with the scent of paint still clinging to the walls and distant frogs croaking near the water, I couldn't help the quiet thrum of unease beneath my ribs. I stared at the ceiling fan spinning slowly above, each turn whispering questions I didn't yet have answers for.

Would this town love me like Cruz did? Would his childhood friends accept me? Would I always feel this out of place?

I turned on my side and looked at Cruz, already asleep, his chest rising and falling in a steady rhythm. My fingers grazed his cheek, tracing the soft stubble there.

""I'm all in,"" I whispered into the dark, even if a small, scared part of me wasn't sure what that promise would cost.



Cruz's POV

I woke to the smell of morning fog and Ember beside me, still tangled in dreams. There was something about this house-even with its creaky floors and crooked cabinets-that already felt like ours. This was it. This was where everything changed.

I used to think moving back home would feel like slipping into a favorite pair of boots-broken in, familiar, comforting. But now? It felt like those boots had been waiting for me all along. Like they'd missed me, the way I'd missed this place.

I padded into the kitchen and ran my hand along the counter I planned to refinish. My dad always said homes are built twice-once with plans, once with memories. I couldn't wait to fill this house with ours. Ember's laughter, holiday mornings, late-night dance sessions in the kitchen, future kids scribbling on the fridge. All of it.

I heard her stir as I poured coffee into her favorite mug-the chipped one with the tiny painted daffodils. She'd brought it from Dallas, claiming it was lucky. I set it by the window so she could see the bayou when she sipped.

She shuffled in moments later, hair a soft mess, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. She looked at the mug and smiled. ""You remember.""

""Of course I did,"" I said, pulling her into a one-armed hug and pecking the top of her head. ""Lucky mug, right?""

She nodded, leaning into my chest.

""This place feels... like we could actually breathe here. Like we could plant roots.""

""That's the plan,"" I said. ""Roots. You and me. Everything we dreamed about back at school, remember?""

She looked out the window, her voice soft. ""I just hope the town feels the same way.""

I turned her to face me. ""Then we'll show them who we are. We'll build the kind of life no one can ignore. You don't have to fit into this town, Ember. This town should be lucky to have you.""

Her eyes shimmered for just a second. ""You always make it sound so easy.""

""It's not easy,"" I admitted. ""But it's worth it. You're worth it. Every long night, every sideways glance, every moment it takes to prove we belong here together.""

She let out a breath, quiet but full of emotion. I watched her tuck her hair behind her ear and stare out over the bayou like she was trying to piece something together. I couldn't help but reach for her hand.

""I don't think I've told you enough,"" I said. ""How proud I am of you. For coming here with me. For believing in this crazy idea of starting over in a town that isn't exactly easy to win over. You're brave, Em. Braver than anyone I know.""

She gave me a look that said she was still figuring out how to take all of this in, but her fingers laced with mine. And for now, that was enough.

We sipped our coffee in silence, the rising sun painting streaks of gold over the bayou. I could already see the memories taking root.

This move wasn't just a return-it was a beginning. I wasn't just home. I was building a life. With Ember.

And I couldn't wait for everything that came next.



The first week of school was magic. And while I loved every second of the chaos, part of my heart still tugged toward home. I missed my parents‚Äîthe way my mom would send me off with muffins and a pep talk, and how my dad always acted like I was about to conquer the world. We FaceTimed every night, and they both reminded me that this move was exactly where I was supposed to be. 'Love like yours and Cruz's doesn't come around twice,' my mom had said. 'Build your life where it feels right.' And I wanted that. With everything in me, I wanted this life with Cruz to work.

Sure, I was up before the sun, already in teacher mode before my first cup of coffee, but something about being back in a classroom‚Äîmy classroom‚Äîmade it all worth it. There was something sacred about that first-day energy. Tiny backpacks, nervous smiles, high-pitched voices calling out my name like it was the safest word they knew. I was exhausted in the best way. My arms were smudged with crayon marks, and I'd found glitter in my hair every night that week. And I wouldn't have changed a thing.

The kids were wild and wonderful, testing boundaries and hugging me like they'd known me forever. They grounded me.

But at home‚Äîaround Cruz's world‚ÄîI felt like I was walking a tightrope. Always balancing. Always smiling.

I didn't know many people outside Cruz's circle, but I recognized a few familiar faces from our brief visits to town. Sadie was one of them‚ÄîCruz's longtime friend. We'd crossed paths a handful of times over the years: quick hellos at holidays, shared tables at large gatherings. She was always nice, always polite. But something about the way she looked at me lingered just a beat too long, like she was taking mental notes.

The only real breath of fresh air came in the form of Kayla.

She was another kindergarten teacher at the school, and I met her on the first day when I spilled an entire tray of markers in the teacher's lounge. Instead of walking past like everyone else, she dropped to the floor to help, cracking a joke about needing roller skates and caffeine to survive.

""Hi, I'm Kayla. And you look like someone who could use a friend in this madhouse.""

From that moment on, she was exactly that. Bold, smart, and sharp-tongued in the best way, Kayla wasn't afraid to speak her mind. And the more time we spent together, the more I realized she was also fiercely protective. She reminded me of the big sister I never had. I hadn't known I needed a support system here‚Äîbut I had one now. And Kayla didn't hesitate to call out the nonsense, especially when it came to Sadie or the subtle slights from Cruz's mom.

Cruz had been working late again, helping his dad reorganize some of the older project files at the office. He'd texted me a few times during the day‚Äî

Can't wait to see you tonight. Miss your face.

You're going to crush this year. Those kids are lucky.

It helped. Reminded me that even if things felt wobbly, we were still us. Or at least trying to be.

Friday night, Sarah invited us over for dinner again. ""Just family,"" she said.

When we pulled into the driveway, I noticed Sadie's car.

I blinked. ""I thought this was just family.""

Cruz looked up from his phone. ""Sadie's always here. You know how our moms are.""

His tone was casual, like it hadn't even occurred to him that her presence might feel off. That twist in my stomach tightened. He didn't mean to dismiss me. He just... didn't see it. Not yet.

Dinner was crawfish √©touff√©e and cornbread, the kind of food that usually tasted like comfort.

I moved toward the seat next to Cruz, ready to slip in beside him, but Sadie got there first. She slid in quickly and smiled like she belonged there, already pouring his sweet tea as if it were routine. Then she blinked, looking between me and the empty seat.

""Oh, Ember‚Äîwere you about to sit here?"" she asked with an apologetic tilt of her head that didn't quite reach her eyes. ""Old habits.""

I shook my head gently. ""No worries. Actually, I like sitting here. I get to see his face when he talks.""

I paused just a moment before easing into the chair across from them.

I took the seat across from them.

Sarah launched into a story about Cruz's eighth-grade science fair, laughing at how he and Sadie built a cardboard bridge together.

""You should've seen them,"" she said, beaming. ""They were such a little team back then. Always building something. So much history.""

She looked right at me as she said it. The implication wasn't subtle.

I forced a smile. ""That's sweet.""

Kate, Sadie's mom, chimed in from the other end of the table. ""Well, Sadie always knew how to bring out the best in Cruz. They had such a rhythm together.""

""Like siblings,"" Cruz said, finally. He laughed, oblivious to the tension tightening my spine.

He meant it innocently. I knew that. But his loyalty to the past‚Äîto the comfort of people who'd always adored him‚Äîsometimes made him blind to the way it cut me.

Cruz, always trying to bridge the gap between his world and mine, turned to me after the first few bites.

""Ember's had the wildest week,"" he said, his eyes warm. ""Her kids already adore her.""

I smiled at him, grateful. ""They're sweet. Wild, but sweet.""

""Oh, tell them about the glitter incident,"" Cruz prompted.

I laughed. ""One of my students tried to make a 'friendship potion' out of glitter glue and juice boxes. It exploded all over the reading rug.""

Everyone chuckled politely. Cruz leaned in a little, his attention steady.

""She's kind of magical,"" he added, and for a second, I felt like maybe I did belong at that table.

Sadie let out a soft laugh. ""Remember when we tried to build a treehouse out of popsicle sticks and duct tape?"" she said, turning toward Cruz.

He grinned. ""We got as far as the first step before it collapsed.""

""Your mom was so mad we took all her freezer pops,"" Sadie added.

They both laughed, lost in the memory, and I smiled along with them, even though it suddenly felt like the spotlight had shifted.

Sarah raised her glass. ""To lifelong friends.""

""To loyalty,"" Kate added.

Cruz clinked his glass against theirs. ""To Ember,"" he said, finally catching my eye. ""For surviving her first week with twenty tiny humans.""

Everyone toasted politely, but I felt like the afterthought at my own celebration.

After dinner, I helped Sarah clear the dishes.

""You can just leave those, sweetie,"" she said, waving me off. ""Sadie knows where everything goes.""

I set the plate down slowly. ""I don't mind helping.""

She gave me a tight smile. ""Of course. You're very... accommodating.""

I said nothing, but my ears burned.

When we got home, I curled up on the couch while Cruz turned on the TV.

""You were quiet tonight,"" he said after a while.

I shrugged. ""Just tired.""

He nudged my foot with his. ""Or... was my mom too much?""

""Not just your mom."" I paused, choosing my words carefully. ""I feel like I keep getting pushed to the edges of everything. Like I'm there... but not really seen.""

Cruz looked confused. ""You're always seen, Em.""

""Not by them.""

He sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. ""It's going to take time,"" he said gently. ""New places, new people... it takes a while to feel like home. But we'll get there. We'll make new memories‚Äîones that are ours.""

I wanted to believe him. I really did.

But promises meant something different when people kept forgetting to keep them.



Cruz's POV

I didn't realize how hard it would be‚Äîblending my past with my future.

Ember was everything. She was my person, my constant, my compass. She made my mornings easier‚Äîalways up before me, already packing my lunch or scribbling little notes in the corner of a paper napkin. Things like: You've got this, or Don't forget your coffee again.

She smiled through the chaos, met me at the door with food and softness and steadiness. I'd come home to warm meals, laundry folded, and her hand rubbing slow circles on my back while I unloaded the weight of the day. She never asked for anything in return. She just made space for me to breathe.

I told myself she was adjusting just fine. She never said otherwise. And I clung to that belief like it was fact, because the truth was‚ÄîI needed her to be okay. Because I barely felt like I was keeping up.

The business was dragging me under.

Taking over my dad's company had sounded like stepping into something familiar, something rooted. But it wasn't just blueprints and woodgrain like I remembered. It was liability insurance, payroll issues, zoning permits, and a hundred tiny decisions that didn't fit neatly into an architectural sketchpad. My days started before sunrise and ended with me passing out fully clothed on the couch, head swimming with schedules and estimates.

And the office‚ÄîGod, the office. My dad had boxes stacked so high in the storage basement that it felt more like an archaeological dig than a workspace. We were digitizing everything, and I was elbow-deep in brittle folders, coughing through decades of dust and mildew. My muscles ached, my mind buzzed, and I hated how often I caught myself drifting through the day without a single thought about Ember‚Äîuntil it was too late.

She never complained. Not once. She just... softened. Smiled smaller. Spoke less. And every time I noticed, it sent a pang of guilt straight through my chest.

One evening, I stopped by my mom's to drop off a few folding tables she'd lent us for the garage. As I stepped through the door, I called out, ""Hey, Mom. Just dropping these off real quick‚ÄîEmber's waiting on me.""

She popped her head around the corner from the dining room, where she was elbow-deep in old photo albums and handwritten recipes.

""Back here,"" she said. ""You've got good timing.""

It wasn't until I stepped fully into the kitchen that I noticed Sadie sitting at the counter, like she'd always belonged there. Her smile lit up like someone had flipped a switch. I blinked.

""Sadie,"" I said, trying to mask my surprise.

She twirled a spoon in her hand. ""Of course Ember's waiting. She always has something warm and homemade, doesn't she?""

""I won't stay long,"" I said quickly, more to remind myself than them. ""Ember's making enchiladas. I've been thinking about them all day.""

Sadie raised an eyebrow and tilted her head. ""Of course she is,"" she said, her voice all sugar. ""She probably irons your napkins too."" She let out a soft laugh, like it was a harmless joke, but something in her tone made me pause.

She pointed to a dish on the counter. ""I was just dropping off a pecan pie my mom made, but your mom roped me into helping sort old pictures. You know how she gets when she's on a memory kick.""

Before I could respond, my mom called out from the dining room, ""Cruz, come look at this one‚Äîyour fourth-grade science fair. You and Sadie with those awful matching shirts!""

And just like that, I was pulled in. One photo turned into a stack. One story into another. Sadie chimed in with exaggerated details, laughing too loud, nudging my shoulder like we were back in high school. I kept glancing at the clock, meaning to leave. But every time I stood up, someone‚Äîeither Sadie or my mom‚Äîhad one more thing to show me, one more memory to tug on.

By the time I checked my phone again, nearly an hour had passed. And I still hadn't texted Ember.

""God,"" I muttered, pushing away from the counter.

""I completely lost track of time‚ÄîEmber's probably wondering where I am.""

Sadie's smile slipped, just slightly. ""Tell her I said hi.""

I nodded, already grabbing my keys.

When I got home, the enchiladas were still warm, but Ember had already eaten. She sat curled on the couch, laptop open, red pen in hand. Grading.

""Sorry I'm late,"" I said, pecking her cheek. ""Got caught up at Mom's.""

She nodded without looking up. ""It's fine.""

But it wasn't. I could feel the space between us.

She clicked her pen shut and finally looked at me. ""Must've been a good conversation,"" she said. ""You were gone awhile.""

I hesitated. ""It wasn't just Mom.""

She paused, then gave a noncommittal, ""Mm.""

""Are we okay?"" I asked, sitting beside her.

After a moment, she added, ""Would you be okay if I didn't text you the next time I was late? If I just decided Kayla or someone else needed my time more than you did?""

Her voice wasn't sharp. It was soft. Honest. And it landed harder than if she'd yelled.

She finally looked at me. ""Cruz... do you really not see it?""

""See what?""

She closed the laptop and set it aside.

""Every time we're with your mom or Sadie, I feel like I'm being erased in slow motion. Like I'm a placeholder in your life instead of a partner.""

The words hit harder than I expected. Because deep down, I knew what she meant.

""That's not true,"" I said, voice rough. ""You're everything to me.""

""Then why does it feel like I'm the only one fighting for us in those rooms?""

I didn't have an answer. Not one that didn't sound like an excuse.

""I'll talk to my mom,"" I said quietly. ""I'll set some boundaries.""

She nodded. ""I'm not asking you to cut anyone out. I just need to know I matter. Out loud. In front of the people who keep pretending I don't.""

I reached for her hand. ""You do. And I'll prove it.""

And I meant it.

But part of me hated that it had taken her spelling it out for me to finally start seeing what had been right in front of me all along.



Ember's POV

It's hard to explain the exhaustion that comes from smiling too long. Not the good kind of smile, either. The kind you plaster on when you're trying not to fall apart.

The months from August to October bled together in a blur of routines and exhaustion. Early mornings, late nights. Cruz working overtime at the shop, me dragging myself through lesson plans, hallway duty, and trying to hold it all together. We passed like ships‚Äîbrief pecks, mumbled goodnights, forgotten conversations over reheated dinners. There was no pause, no breath, no real us anymore.

By mid-October, the weather cooled slightly, but the tension in my chest only got heavier. Between grading papers, helping Kayla organize the fall reading event at school, and dodging Cruz's mom's increasingly pointed comments about how ""Sadie always knew how to make herself useful,"" I felt like I was constantly bracing for a hit that hadn't landed yet.

And then came the Halloween party.

Halloween had always been my favorite. The colors, the crispness in the air, the excuse to transform into someone else for a night‚ÄîI loved everything about it. I loved the smell of cinnamon candles and caramel apples, the crunch of leaves under boots, the flicker of porch lights glowing over jack-o'-lanterns. Fall felt like change, but the good kind.

Back in college, Cruz and I had started a tradition of doing couple costumes. It started as a joke‚Äîone year we went as peanut butter and jelly‚Äîbut over time, it became something special. Something we planned for and looked forward to, even when everything else felt uncertain. It was ours.

This year, we chose Eric and Ariel. Corny, yes, but it was sentimental. I found the perfect flowing teal skirt and seashell top. Cruz had the crisp white shirt and navy pants. We were ready. I felt ready.

As we got into the car, I reached for his hand and smiled. ""You sure you're ready for this much Disney magic?""

He chuckled, squeezing my fingers. ""I've been ready. You make a better Ariel than the original. Honestly, Em... you look like a dream.""

I felt heat rise to my cheeks. ""You clean up pretty nice too, Prince Eric.""

He grinned. ""Let's go make everyone jealous.""

When we showed up to his parents' annual Halloween party, I actually felt good for the first time in weeks. For once, I wasn't the outsider‚ÄîI was the fianc√©e, standing proudly next to her Prince Eric.

That lasted about five minutes.

Sadie walked in ten minutes after us.

Wearing the same Ariel costume.

Only hers was tighter, flashier. She'd added glitter to the bodice and wore bright red lipstick that smeared when she smiled too wide. Her hair curled to perfection, and she made a dramatic entrance like she'd just stepped out of a commercial.

People noticed.

""Oh, look at that!"" Sarah laughed too loud. ""Two Ariels! How cute.""

Sadie beamed. ""What can I say? Great minds think alike.""

""I swear she must've stalked your Pinterest board,"" Kayla muttered to me, already clenching her drink tighter.

Cruz didn't say anything. Just laughed awkwardly and led me toward the drinks table.

""She probably didn't know,"" he whispered.

""Did you tell her what we were dressing up as?"" I asked.

""I mean... it might've come up last week. But I didn't think she'd copy it.""

Of course she did.

""Cruz."" I looked at him hard. ""Are you serious?""

He didn't answer, just scratched the back of his neck. ""It's probably just a coincidence.""

I gave him a look, but he avoided my eyes. That said enough.

The night blurred. Sadie found reasons to stand next to Cruz in every photo, giggling and tossing her hair. Sarah complimented her costume no less than six times. Kate made a joke about how Sadie looked more like Ariel from the movie.

""She's just got the right coloring,"" Sarah said, sipping her wine. ""And she always knew how to work a crowd.""

Kayla, never one to let nonsense slide, leaned in and whispered, ""More like she works angles like a reality show contestant.""

I smiled tightly. Cruz glanced at me, but said nothing. Even when I nudged him slightly during a picture Sadie tried to wedge herself into, he just kept smiling like nothing was wrong.

Kayla stepped in‚Äîliterally‚Äîlooping her arm through mine and saying, loud enough for half the room to hear, ""Let's keep the princess and her prince together, yeah?""

When Sarah gushed again over Sadie's glittery bodice, Kayla raised her drink and said, ""Guess they're handing out compliments for knock-offs tonight.""

Kate loudly commented later, ""It's just such a shame Sadie isn't in a serious relationship. She always did light up the room.""

Kayla nearly choked on her drink.

""Probably all that glitter.""

She didn't care that people were watching. In fact, I think she wanted them to. Every side glance, every fake-smile insult‚Äîthey didn't scare her. She stood between me and the worst of it like a shield wrapped in sarcasm and wine.

""Next year, you're going as Maleficent,"" she muttered. ""Let's show them what a real villain looks like.""

By the time Cruz and I got home, my smile had worn off.

The car ride had been mostly silent. I was too tired to pretend, and he seemed too oblivious to notice. Once we stepped through the door, I slipped out of my shoes and said nothing. The silence was thick, but I needed him to say something first. Anything.

He finally glanced at me, brow furrowed. ""You okay?""

I let out a breath and walked into the bedroom. ""Did you see the way she kept touching your arm?"" I asked, pulling pins from my hair, each one sharper than the last.

He sighed. ""Em, it's Halloween. Everyone was messing around.""

""Not everyone. Just her. And your mom ate it up.""

He rubbed the back of his neck, that same tired shrug in his voice. ""Maybe Sadie just wanted to feel like she was part of something.""

I blinked, stunned. The hurt simmered beneath my skin.

""She is part of something, Cruz. She inserted herself right into the middle of our night. And you let her. Again.""

He said nothing. Just stood there, hands at his sides like he couldn't decide whether to defend her or defuse me.

I stared at him, heart tight. ""Let me ask you something. What if Kayla had shown up to a party we were invited to‚Äîinserted herself into a couple's costume another friend planned, and then spent the whole night clinging to someone else's fianc√©? Would you really just brush it off? Would you still think it was harmless, that she just wanted to 'feel included'?""

Still, nothing.

He opened his mouth, like maybe he was going to try to defend her again.

""Don't,"" I said quietly, without turning around. ""I've had enough of her joining our night. I don't need her invading my dreams too.""

I turned away. My hands were shaking, but I wouldn't let him see that.

Because sometimes, silence says more than denial ever could.

I didn't push. I just walked into the bathroom and closed the door.

Because if I didn't, I might've said something I couldn't take back.

Chapter 1 - The Unwelcome Surprise

My supposedly sterile husband not only had a wife, but also a pair of twins.

Thinking of my husband‚Äôs sweet promises, I decided to give up my dream of being a war correspondent and transfer back home.

My first assignment after returning was to interview a renowned domestic entrepreneur‚Äîmy husband.

I didn‚Äôt tell him about it, planning to surprise him.

But when I knocked on the door, a woman answered.

‚ÄúYou must be the reporters, right? Marcus got called into a last-minute meeting‚Äîplease come in and wait!‚Äù

‚ÄúI can help with the interview first. He should be back any minute!‚Äù

Seeing this woman in my home, acting like she owned the place, made me uneasy.

But remembering my husband had a vasectomy for me, I reassured myself she might be his assistant.

How wrong I was.

The young woman in a Victorian-style dress warmly brought us two cups of coffee and some spiced honey cakes.

‚ÄúThank you. Let‚Äôs begin with a few preliminary questions.‚Äù

I took the coffee cup and signaled the cameraman to start rolling.

She smiled, straightened her dress, and sat directly across from me.

‚ÄúSorry about the mess. Marcus has been swamped lately‚ÄîI‚Äôve been managing everything at home and didn‚Äôt even have time to freshen up.‚Äù

I frowned slightly. Since when did assistants do housekeeping?

Noticing my hesitation, she added, ‚ÄúLet me introduce myself. I‚Äôm Blair Ellis. What‚Äôs this interview focusing on?‚Äù

Setting my doubts aside for the moment, I smiled and replied, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mostly about the daily life of entrepreneurs, for a documentary.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve got loads to share about that!‚Äù

She laughed, her eyes shining with pride.

‚ÄúHe always says no matter how busy he is, family comes first.‚Äù

‚ÄúLast week, when our child spiked a fever, he canceled two meetings and rushed home to stay with us all night.‚Äù

I froze.

Something felt off.

What did she mean by ‚Äústaying with her and the child‚Äù?

Hesitantly, I asked, ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ have children?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, two‚Äîa boy and a girl, twins!‚Äù

She picked up her phone, smiling as she swiped to her photos and handed it to me.

‚ÄúThey just started kindergarten‚Äîalways keeping us on our toes!‚Äù

In the photo, Marcus was holding a little boy, with a little girl clinging to his leg.

I stared at the image, feeling as if I‚Äôd been struck by lightning, completely numb.

In the picture, Marcus looked completely at ease, happier than I‚Äôd ever seen him.

Chapter 2 - The Wedding Photo That Broke My Heart

But he‚Äôs never looked at me that tenderly before!

I stood frozen as Blair Ellis suddenly broke into a smile:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a blessing not to be married‚Äîyou can‚Äôt imagine how exhausting it is to raise two kids.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey look sweet, but they‚Äôre absolute troublemakers!‚Äù

She chuckled, closed the photo album, and headed toward the master bedroom.

‚ÄúCome, I‚Äôll show you something even better!‚Äù

I stared blankly at her back, my mind reeling.

So while I was out there as a war correspondent, ducking in trenches and risking my life every day‚Äî

He brought this woman into our home and started a family with her!

My chest tightened with a pain so sharp I could hardly breathe.

It wasn‚Äôt until the photographer nudged me that I numbly followed her.

Inside the bedroom, a giant wedding portrait hung above the headboard.

In the photo, Marcus King looked dashing in a tailored tuxedo,

his arm wrapped around Blair Ellis, her lace veil spilling onto the floor. They were gazing into each other‚Äôs eyes, all smiles under the sunset glow.

‚ÄúThis was in the Bahamas! Marcus just loves taking pictures with me‚Äîhe absolutely wore me out that day!‚Äù

‚ÄúEven the photographer said he‚Äôd never seen a couple so in love.‚Äù

Blair traced the edge of the photo frame, her voice syrupy with affection.

I dug my nails into my palms, trembling from head to toe.

When we got our marriage certificate, we were so broke we could barely afford a decent meal, let alone a photoshoot.

Later, when things got better, I brought up the idea of taking wedding photos to make up for it.

But Marcus always brushed it off, saying he hated having his picture taken!

And now‚Äînot only did he take these photos with someone else, smiling like he‚Äôd never been happier‚Äî

He even claimed he enjoyed it!

So it wasn‚Äôt that he disliked photos.

He just didn‚Äôt want to be in them with me!

The thought shattered me. Tears spilled from my eyes before I could stop them.

But Blair pretended not to notice, still smiling brightly as she watched me.

‚ÄúYou know, Marcus can be so romantic. Every year on our anniversary, he always‚Äî‚Äù

Just then, a key turned in the front door.

‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs home! Wait here just a moment‚ÄîI‚Äôll go let him in!‚Äù

Blair shot me a cheerful look and hurried out.

I stood rooted in place, staring helplessly at that wedding photo‚Äîso bright it felt like it was burning my eyes.

From the living room, lively footsteps approached, mixed with the bright laughter of children.

I turned and saw Marcus walking in, holding a child in each hand.

The little boy was in blue overalls; the little girl had her hair in two tiny braids.

They hopped and skipped around him.

‚ÄúDaddy! Can we get gelato?‚Äù

The little girl tugged at his sleeve, swinging back and forth.

‚ÄúNot today, sweetheart. You just had some yesterday.‚Äù",1,1757478464.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Attirant plus de 25 000 √©tudiants chaque ann√©e, elle offre une vari√©t√© de lieux adapt√©s √† la r√©vision nocturne, allant des biblioth√®ques universitaires aux espaces de coworking, en passant par des coffee shops et des parcs.

Les biblioth√®ques universitaires restent les lieux les plus propices √† la concentration. La Biblioth√®que Universitaire Saint-Jean-d'Ang√©ly, ouverte jusqu‚Äô√† minuit en semaine, est particuli√®rement pris√©e des √©tudiants noctambules. Elle propose 482 places assises, des salles de travail en groupe et des cabines insonoris√©es, parfaites pour pr√©parer des oraux. √Ä proximit√© de l‚ÄôIAE et de la Facult√© de Chirurgie dentaire, son acc√®s est gratuit, de 8h √† 23h55 en semaine. La BU Sciences, situ√©e dans le parc Valrose, offre √©galement un grand espace (600 places), avec salles de travail collectif et cabines insonoris√©es, ouverte jusqu‚Äô√† 22h en semaine.

Pour ceux qui pr√©f√®rent une ambiance plus dynamique, les espaces de coworking et co-learning √† Nice sont une alternative int√©ressante. MyWO Lib Massena, situ√© entre la plage et la vieille ville, est un espace convivial ouvert de 7h √† 21h, o√π il suffit de consommer une boisson pour acc√©der au wifi et travailler dans une ambiance chaleureuse. Le co-learning Montebello, g√©r√© par le CROUS et ouvert 24h/24 et 7j/7, est id√©al pour les √©tudiants de l‚ÄôUniversit√© C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur, avec acc√®s r√©serv√© aux membres d√ªment inscrits. Enfin, le Vestiaire √† MoT allie librairie sportive et coworking jusqu‚Äô√† 19h, dans une atmosph√®re cosy, avec des tarifs au temps pass√© ou √† la journ√©e.

Les coffee shops constituent aussi une bonne option, m√™lant travail et plaisir dans des cadres confortables. Emilie and the Cool Kids, l‚Äôun des premiers caf√©s de Nice, ouvre tous les jours jusqu‚Äô√† 19h30 et propose un espace propice aux √©tudes avec wifi et p√¢tisseries maison. Le Copenhagen Coffee Lab offre une ambiance scandina ve calme, avec prises √©lectriques √† quasi chaque table, tr√®s appr√©ci√© des √©tudiants en commerce et gestion.

Enfin, profiter du climat m√©diterran√©en est √©galement possible gr√¢ce aux nombreux parcs et jardins de la ville. La Colline du Ch√¢teau, ouverte jusqu‚Äô√† 20h, offre un environnement paisible pour travailler en plein air, tandis que le Jardin Albert 1er, ouvert jusqu‚Äô√† 23h en √©t√©, allie d√©tente et travail dans un cadre verdoyant et central.

Ainsi, Nice propose un √©ventail complet de lieux pour √©tudier le soir, garantissant √† chacun la possibilit√© de trouver un cadre adapt√© √† ses besoins et √† son rythme, entre calme, convivialit√© et connexion √† la nature.
