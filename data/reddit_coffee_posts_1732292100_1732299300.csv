I LOVE maple. Scent, flavor, all year round. I have Maple Sugar by indie house Hoshi Gato that I absolutely adore (plz check them out, they are amazing).

So anyways, I read the reviews *ahem* horror stories of Followed and thought, ‚ÄúThis is for me. My body is ready for maple‚Äù. Got the sample in the mail a couple days ago and laughed at it being double-baggied separately from the others in the order like a tiny war criminal. I could semi smell it through two bags, could def smell it through one bag. I was getting coffee and maple and a bit of Maggi seasoning but I like that smell too so whatev lol.

Today is the day I‚Äôm taking it for a test drive and I am somewhat sorry to report that on me it‚Äôs just pulling mostly coffee! It is strong for sure. I smell like a creature recently emerged from the bulk coffee bin at the grocery store after a long incubation period. I can smell the maple too but it‚Äôs def secondary to Big Coffee.

1gxe48t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1gxe48t/possets_reviews/,Possets Reviews!,"Overall, I‚Äôm really impressed by this house and the elegance of their scents.
The ratings are very much biased towards my preferences‚Äîquiet and non-sweet scents.


**Howl**

*Black, red and amber musks wrestle furiously with sandalwood and opium tar resin. There is nothing light or gentle about this scent. A burning incense backs it up, black patchouli stands in the forefront. Dark, musky, resinous.*

Keywords: sex(?), sweaty skin, sweet resins, long lasting.

Definitely dark-sweet and very resinous. As for the animalistic part, I was hoping for fur but this is mostly sweat. Very true to the description: ‚ÄúThere was sweat and sex, the world was discovered for the first time.‚Äù If you want to smell seductive and mysterious, but also faintly like you just had sex, this kinda nails it. Resins stay in the fade and turns very gentle and soothing. 2/5 I admire this but would never wear.



**HopHead (Unknown)**

*Coffee in its most perfectly beautiful form is dropped into five ambers which range from sweet to dry.*

Keyword: dark coffee (yay), looots of amber

This is quite literal to its description. I like the bitter coffee in this but amber smells really really ‚Äúsharp‚Äù to me (almost like a sweet version of tiger balm). Not unpleasant just not entirely pleasing either‚Äîon the verge of migraine inducing. Ugh, but I like the coffee a lot. 3/5. Fades quickly. 



**Arrival of the Queen of Sheba**

*Mysore sandalwood, suede, frankincense, patchouli, 4 vanillas.*

Keywords: suede, vanilla, wood.

Strange in the nicest way. It‚Äôs like opening a wooden closet that has a ton of new suede jackets inside, but the closet is also sprayed with vanilla perfume? It‚Äôs suede forward on me and I never had that note show up so strongly on my skin before. Intriguing tension between the cold suede and the warmer vanilla. I like this but there‚Äôs a stickiness to its sweetness  (from the vanilla) that doesn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúme‚Äù. Will use up my sample then decide. 5/5.



**Death (The Pardoner‚Äôs Tale)**

*As dark a vetiver as you could possibly smell mixes with smooth thyme and a good jolt of black amber. A faraway touch of incense and a tiny amount of pure smoke.*

Keywords: strong herbs, light florals, tomato leaves?, frankincense.   

The floral I‚Äôm getting might be from the black amber? The greens are really fresh and sharp. But that‚Äôs it for me: just pure fresh greens and a bit of soapiness. I wish there was more of that smoke in the description. Dries into bitter greens plus frankincense. 2/5.



**Silver Cedar**

*Vanilla, a hint of light florals, a bit of lemon and Virginia Cedar.*

Keyword: CEDAR, CEDAR, CEDAR

Love cedar and love this. The description says light florals, lemon, and vanilla, but I‚Äôm just getting cedar‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs completely okay. The vanilla and floral came out more in the dry down but the cedar is so prominent through out. I need this in my life. 5/5. 



**Dance with me**

*A superb coumarin-laced subtle lavender combines with fizzy pink grapefruit, and it all rests on a bed of white musk.*

Keywords: cleaning products, bright and bubbly, fruit flavored soft drink

Unfortunately this smells like fruit scented cleaning products to me (fruit soda in the dry down). I honestly don‚Äôt enjoy fruity scents so it‚Äôs on me for picking this scent to buy. 1/5



**Samarkand**

*Rich proprietary black musk, a thick addition of darkest black tea, knit together with a smooth but almost undetectable attar of roses (which is a catalyst for the whole). The most exquisite nag champa and finally topped off with a thick syrupy aged patchouli and a huge shot of incense.*

Keywords: fancy, resins, rose, spices

Very fancy, almost stereotypically so. The rose is strong on me and it‚Äôs a very very sweet and feminine scent overall. This is loud and proud, something to wear when you want to assert your presence. 2/5



**Arc of Venus**

*Sexy sandalwood base flirts with oakmoss, a small hint of calendula, ""abstract"" musk, and a bit of sharp grey musk which is seldom used but goes perfectly in this melange.*

Keywords: chocolate?, wood, well-rounded and warm, a hint of fresh herbs-like scent

I don‚Äôt know which notes did it but something smelled really like chocolate at first. Faded quite quickly and becomes a soft musky blend with a bit of lavender on top. 4/5. Pretty but not memorable. 



**Beatrice**

*The Silver base combines with five of the most beautiful musks* which Possets produces. Skin musk, 2 white musks, ""Crystalline"" musk, and grey musk.*

Keywords: translucence, vanilla, musky

The word ‚Äúcrystalline‚Äù in the description really captures it. It has this creaminess that hovers rather than smothers you. Reminds me of Alkemia‚Äôs Madame Pearl. That being said, it is VERY sweet and there isn‚Äôt anything like the cool bone china or paper notes in Madame Pearl to balance it out. Very pretty but too sweet for me. 3/5



**Terra Incognita**

*Five different types of black musk and pink and black pepper essential oils come together to make a serious and dark blend with tremendous staying power.*

Keywords: oh-hey-there-weird-chocolaty-scent-that-fades-quickly, spicy, what am I smelling

I honestly don‚Äôt know how to describe this. It‚Äôs very pepper forward? Not dark like the description says but also not light and soft. I can see myself wearing this in bed, reading, and wrapped in blankets on a cold winter night. It‚Äôs a very solitary scent. Not calming per se but emanating a sort of anchored-ness. I know that doesn‚Äôt help but I think I just can‚Äôt find words to describe the black musks. 5/5. 



**Dies Irae (Verdi)**

*Three black musks, one fog-like musk to disburse the whole, bitter galbanum, smooth hawthorne, the scent of rotting leaves, a small amount of orris, and smoky oude, finally frankincense and black amber.*

Keywords: dark, bitter greens, smoke, rotting leaves, incense

This lives up to its description of being intense and dark. In the bottle it is the stereotypical decaying wet leaves. On skin, this almost looms over me with its moodiness. One of the reviews on their website describes this as ‚Äúdarkness aflame‚Äù and I wholeheartedly agree. 4/5 love it but unfortunately slightly headache inducing. 



**Madame X**

*Skin musk, wax, cream, lemon zest, champagne, and a kiss of bitter vanilla.*

Keywords: sour(??), creamy, summer-ish

I sniffed it on my skin and had to look up what that sour note might be. Turns out there‚Äôs lemon in this. It‚Äôs a gentle skin scent, a bit soapy and on the verge of smelling like cleaning products, but the vanilla and musks saves it from being overly fresh. There‚Äôs a nice balance between being gentle and creamy but also bright and lighthearted. I just personally don‚Äôt enjoy the  lemon in this. 2/5



**Venus Black**

*The Blackest musk flirts with a float of black pepper, a shot of dark sweet pear, and the smallest amount of sage and non-stinky narcissus for tingle.*

Keywords: pepper, Terra Incognita but with florals and soap. 

I don‚Äôt get pear, just pepper and some sort of floral‚Äîis that the narcissus? When I smell this I imagine a well-accomplished, elegant individual on a business trip‚Äîmature and knows what they‚Äôre doing. Not me at all. 3/5.



**Seraphim**

*Five vanillas (most of them fat and buttery vanillas cut with lean and sharp vanillas) and are blended with six different ambers which give the hypnotic part to the whole.*

Keywords: vanilla, clean, bright, oh no sharp amber

I honestly envy people that love amber. I get the vibe of this but on my skin amber just goes straight up my nose jabbing into my head lol. Amber is great in small amounts, way too overpowering on my skin. This is mainly amber with vanilla. Objectively I think it‚Äôs a great scent 4/5.



**Feather Down**

*This is the natural pairing of a breathtaking Bulgarian lavender full of coumarin, which smells delightfully vanilla-like on its own, with a genuinely otherworldly beautiful aged vanilla essential oil.*

Keywords: sticky sweet

I blind bought a small bottle: mistake. I don‚Äôt hate it but I don‚Äôt like it as much as some of the other lavender scents tested. This as a weird sweetness that makes me feel like something‚Äôs stuck down my throat and I don‚Äôt know where it‚Äôs coming from. 2/5.



**Indigo** vs **Silver Lavender**

Indigo: *A hint of lavender and a kiss of spice and the tiniest bit of vanilla.*
Silver Lavender: *‚Ä¶the unbelievable wonder of a vanilla-like lavender paired up with the Silver accord we all love, with a drop or two of sandalwood to mellow it all out‚Ä¶*

Honestly have trouble choosing between the two. Both are beautiful. Indigo is more grounded, cooler, and silver lavender is lighter and sweeter. May go with Indigo in the end since it feels like a perfect pillow scent. Both 5/5.



**Amethyst**

*A sharp amber to start combines with a smoother and more caramel-like amber and a great shot of lavender on top of it all.*

Keywords: sharp amber, herbal lavender

The lavender in this is pretty herbal. Amber isn‚Äôt too strong in this but still there. Nice calming scent. Probably the most stereotypical dried herbal lavender out of all these I‚Äôve tested. 4/5



**Lavender Corset**

*Lavender Corset is more lilac than lavender, very feminine, long lasting and a persistent whisper of a fragrance.*

Keywords: dainty, feminine, lilac, soothing

Lilac is certainly the main note and lavender really acts to balance out its sweetness. To wear when you want to feel pretty and delicate. I really like this but would like to smell this on someone else more. 5/5.



**Lavender Pepys**

*Yes, there have been candies made with lavender in the past. Pastilles usually, but when you mix that clean and innocent smell with something devilish like marshmallow and other goodies, then you have a real sinful thing to enjoy after a long dry season of denial.*

Keywords: candy, chocolate?, lavender

The description says it‚Äôs not too foody but it‚Äôs pretty foody on me. There‚Äôs a candy smell that‚Äôs not overly sweet and a hint of chocolate. For some reason it turn almost medicinal on me as it dries, like sugar coated herbal medicine pills. 3/5. 

Verdict: Silver cedar is the favorite! 

I‚Äôm still testing the longevity of Indigo, Silver Lavender, Arrival of the Queen of Sheba and Terra Incognita. 

Terra Incognita is really beautiful but strangely seems to last pretty short on me. However, I‚Äôve been wearing my sample when I‚Äôm really busy so I‚Äôm hoping that I just forgot to mentally time its longevity. 

Ironically, I got this haul looking for the perfect lavender scent and ended up not immediately full sizing any lavender scents. Will probably choose from Indigo, Amethyst, and Silver Lavender depending on how long they last. Lavender Corset is so lovely I might cave and buy a small vial. 

Incidentally: 
I‚Äôm blind buying Dracula Rising (Tomney) and Moonbux with a full size of Silver Cedar. Any recommendations to further sample or to blind buy when I inevitably place another order? 

On my list I have:

Toccata and Fugue in D Minor (Bach)

Black River

Danse Chinoise (Tea) Nutcracker

Hungarian Rhapsody (Liszt) 

Would love to get reviews on these since they don‚Äôt have samples!

1gxdzuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookpro/comments/1gxdzuc/nanotexture_display_and_greasy_keyboards/,Nano-texture display and greasy keyboards,"Hi everybody!!!

  
Sorry to add another post on here regarding the new nano-texture display option, but I haven't found any insight regarding my specific scenario. 

  
Now that you've been able to use your macbook with nano-texture display for a bit, **do you notice the nano-texture display showing greasy keyboard key outlines on the screen?** 



I have a habit of using my laptop at the kitchen table, at coffee shops, while snacking on the couch, etc., so the keys inevitably get a little greasy, and I'm not always able to clean them off prior to closing the laptop. This results in the outlines showing up on the screen, which I then clean off 1-2x/week with a microfiber cloth and water. This does require some ""elbow grease"" and firm rubbing to remove them...**I am worried the nano-texture will either hang onto the grease and make it even tougher to clean and/or require even more vigorous cleaning (damaging the textured display) to get them off.** 

  
Can anybody comment on this? Here's a picture as an example (image is not mine, but my laptop looks similar)

My partner(35 y/o Male) is epileptic with numerous ""drop attacks"" (mini seizures -- not sure what the medical term is) daily. 

He's had 2 grand mal seizures in the 5 years we've been together, and once when getting his medication after the ER, the pharmacist gave me all the directions - like sleeping 8 hours and not skipping meals.

My partner eats once a day, and sleeps extremely erratically (he's a business owner) sometimes 6 hours or less, sometimes 11 hours or more. Goes to sleep anytime from 9PM-7AM. He doesn't take care of himself well, I have researched and apparently dehydration can trigger seizures as well and all he drinks is coke or coffee. I worry that his lack of care is a big stressor for his drop attacks.

We've started talking about having children and I'm curious if taking medication as directed would help him not get drop attacks.

1gxdx12,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gxdx12/northern_vietnam_singapore_2_week_journey_review/,Northern Vietnam & Singapore - 2 week journey review,"Hi everyone,

I want to share my experience traveling to North of Vietnam and Singapore. This is my own personal and honest review, others might obviously have a different opinion.

**# of travellers:** 2

**Date:** beginning to mid November

**Itinerary** (describing total nights per location):

* 6 nights in Hanoi
* 2 nights in Sa Pa
* 1 night in Ha Long Bay (vSpirit Cruise)
* Day trip to Ninh Binh
* 3 nights in Singapore

**Vietnam notes:**

* Since we were travelling with 2 large bags we decided to book the hotel in Hanoi for the duration of our stay in Hanoi to act as an HQ where we could leave our stuff, have them washed between trips and so on.
* We stayed at Hotel Du Lac in Hanoi and for the first time we asked somebody else to organise our tours instead of on our own. The hotel organised everything and was in general amazing in every aspect and would recommend it if it fits your budget)

**Hanoi review:**

* Believe it or not, Hanoi is the highlight of our Northern Vietnam stay. It's such a bustling and vibrant place. It's a complete experience - chaotic place that flows like river.
* The highlights is the overall vibe, the people, the street life, unbothered by everyday bs, the food, the coffee, the various shops, the temple of literature, various rooftop bars, train street and just walking through the city and taking in the views.
* A special mention for food is:
   * 4P's pizza place, something totally unexpected, but I went there two days in a row to eat the spicy garlic shrimp pizza. Maybe my fav pizza place in the world ($$)
   * L'essence De Cuisine ($$$)
   * Quan Cay Da ($)
   * Banh Mi 25 ($)
   * Dreamers & Seekers (breakfast) ($$)
   * Bun rieu Co Hoan Hang ($)
* For men, if you'd like to tailor a suite, I had one made at -nha may ngominh 40b hang manh (linen suite for $350 - super happy with it). For women, there are amazing silk shops. Also worth to mention a cool place for contemporary souvenirs is Tired city.
* The only big negative for me is the horrible air pollution and smog. This is all across northern Vietnam (even Sapa) the issue.

**Sa Pa review:**

* Sa Pa is a very poor part of Vietnam, even for Vietnamese standards. The town itself is swamped by foot massage parlours, hotels and restaurants. Besides the train station, it is not an eye catching town and doesn't provide too much to do when not trekking.
* We did two days of private trekking with a local guide, first day was the route to Cat Cat village and this was an amazing experience. Cat Cat village is a beautiful village nestled between waterfalls and a river. It is also developed to provide an experience to tourists.
* The second day we did the trek from Sa Pa to Ta Van village. The first part with the views of the rice fields was nice, but the rest was underwhelming as there was a lot of garbage and pollution throughout these villages. If this is something that impacts your experience, I would suggest to maybe better rent a moped and drive around these villages and take in the sceneries.
* A special mention for food is:
   * Hamong restaurant ($$)
   * The Mist Sapa (breakfast & coffee)($)
* Sadly we had bad weather and couldn't visit Fansipan mountain.
* Sapa is probably a completely different vibe and experience before the rice harvest in August and early September.

**Ha Long Bay cruise:**

* To put it short, I was happy to visit this incredible wonder of nature (2000 islands), but would not go back ever. It is super polluted and I am greatly disappointed about the negligence for such a location which is a UNESCO World heritage site. We did 1 night and would have not been happy if we booked 1 more. Also the place where you board the taxi boat is a dystopian place where they overbuilt and abandoned whole complexes of buildings.

**Ninh Binh:**

* A day trip from Hanoi was packed with activities, but I wish we booked 2-3 nights in Ninh Binh, it's also called Ha Long on land and it is much better experience than Ha Long Bay.
* It was actually the most beautiful location we visited, in particular the Trang An boat ride. We did a 1.5h boat ride, I wish it was 3h. A truly magical place and experience.

**Singapore**

* I was super impressed by Singapore in many aspects. If there is a Solar Punk place in the world - then it is Singapore.
* Highlights is the whole country, super clean, super organised, super friendly and packed with content.
* The only downside is how incredibly expensive it is, but to be honest, when you see how Singapore is organised, I'm happy to support that economy. They are ahead of the curve, maybe Japan and Switzerland can match Singapore in terms of development.
* Special mentions:
   * Gardens by the Bay (esp. Cloud Forest)
   * NOVA skybar at night for a 360 view of Singapore (free of charge)
   * Chinese quarter
   * Lau Pa Sat and other Hawker places ($)
   * LECOQ bar and location for a night out
* We stayed at a bit pricier hotel, but it was amazing value for money - The Clan and would definitely recommend it

**Tips and recommendations:**

* Get your visa on time for Vietnam (yes the official [website](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/en_US/web/guest/trang-chu-ttdt) looks dodgy but it is correct)
* Use Grab for transportation
* We got a eSim from Viettel (note: a lot of spam calls and sms, just ignore them)
* I withdrew cash via Revolut, had no troubles with paying with Revolut in general
* We didn't drink tap water, but we had a lot of drinks with ice and probably tap water (juices), but didn't have any stomach troubles.
* Vietnamese beer is amazing (Hanoi and Saigon beer)
* Singapore has amazing public transport or you can use Grab
* If you want to go to a bar on the top of Marina Bay Sands, there are a couple of options, the most popular is Ce La Vie (with the pool), but men need to have long pants to be able to access that place a night. There is a public bar with no dress code, but to be honest the place is a highly expensive tourist trap. Happy to have visited though and had a $18 beer (ok ok, I had 2).

1gxdwob,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1gxdwob/adhd_gf/,ADHD gf ,"Hi so my gf has ADHD and works online from home as a recruiter, she makes phone calls, meetings, work etc all from home. The past few weeks she has been struggling with finding the right dose that doesn‚Äôt make her numb to her feelings and a robot while trying to keep up with her work load. She told me she stopped taking her medication as consistently as usual which has been causing her to feel her feelings more but also making her more anxious!

But because of less medication in her system she has also been forgetting to do things at work such as responding to emails, responding to new hire candidates, and just more open communication at work. She feeling like a failure at work, almost imposter syndrome when her ADHD brain is not controlled with the proper dose of meds. She has a meeting with her boss because of it and has been crying and feeling super anxious. 


I told her she should be upfront about her ADHD struggles with her boss and that life has just been crazy, not that it‚Äôs an excuse but I think her work is really caring and understanding if she did explain. Poor thing has been crying and stressed about it.. I held her and just let her cry it out and explained she‚Äôs going through a tough time and to give herself grace and patience, it‚Äôs just a bad week but it doesn‚Äôt make her a bad employee; I‚Äôve seen her fill super hard roles in matters of months, sometimes the hiring managers are picky and she‚Äôs great at what she does and gets it done. I think she‚Äôs just going through change and it‚Äôs hard for her to stay organized and consistent.


I told her that it will be okay and that we can help her get more organized and set up. I cleaned and rearranged her room to where she has room for her desk and monitors along with setting up a white board and calendar above her desk to right important things so were she can see it all the important task she needs to do and can cross them off as she goes! I also thought she could maybe go to coffee shops or library‚Äôs to work when she doesn‚Äôt have meetings to get out of the house. 

I just want to know if you guys have any tips or tricks working from home along with ADHD things to help with the consistency and minimize some struggles that comes with ADHD! 


I love her and I don‚Äôt want this to overshadow the amount of good she‚Äôs done at her job and just the joys of ADHD she brings when it‚Äôs channeled correctly! ",1,1732298161.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1gxdvft,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamingfriends/comments/1gxdvft/29_f_looking_for_more_spooky_friends/,29 F - Looking for more Spooky Friends!,"Hello! 

I am currently looking for a friend our group of friends to play games/hang out in discord with. I play a little bit of everything but my two biggest games are Dead by Daylight and World of Warcraft though my steam is a graveyard of random other spooky (and survival) games as well. Would love someone to play Dead by Daylight with. I keep a pretty standard schedule and mostly play after 6 PM EST. I am also an old lady who will sometimes go to bed early, but am willing to drink a second cup of coffee if the company and games are good.

I love all things scary/Halloween all year round. When I'm not playing games I am either reading or watching horror. My favorite movie is *Scream* and my house is a shrine to GhostFace but I also love the *V.H.S* franchise, *The Boulet Brothers Dragula* and *Gilmore Girls* (there's some variety there). Other hobbies include Dungeons and Dragons, Live Action Roleplaying and Tarantula keeping. I also enjoy a nice stroll through a cemetery with my husband, and looking at old architecture (specifically churches). 

Feel free to message, making friends as adults is so hard. My favorite dinosaur is the plesiosaurus if that helps. ",1,1732298073.0,gamingfriends,3,1.0,False
1gxdv5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1gxdv5y/the_black_hills_witch_part_1/,The Black Hills Witch -Part 1,"The Black Hills Witch

by Josh Salamun

Part 1

An article from the Rapid City newspaper proudly framed in the window reads:

""Mayor Salamander is gathering with leaders to declare, 'This City belongs to Jesus.'""

I can't stand these Christians. They're like harmless little sheep‚Äîbut in every flock hides a wolf. And I can smell one.

Since then, Mayor Salamander has shown us his ""Christian love"" by shutting down homeless shelters, strangling food services, and unleashing his personal police force to hunt down anyone who doesn't fit into his idea of ""righteous.""

It's been a long time since this witch wandered out of the forests of The Black Hills. That's right. I'm a one-thousand-year-old witch. People say, ""You don't look a day over 30,"" which stings because back in the 1800s, they said, ""not a day over 20."" One thing's clear‚ÄîRapid City needs me now more than ever. So here I am, spellbook in hand, ready to squash this Salamander with my black pointy shoes.

In the meantime, I'm investigating his inner circle, which is why I took a job at the local Christian coffee shop, Bean Saved.

It's owned by Pastor Dan, a close friend and supporter of Mayor Salamander.

It's unsettling how this so-called ""Christian"" mayor surrounds himself with people hiding secrets‚Äîshadows of the past.

But that's where I find my pretty little victims. A monster lurking in the pews, preying on innocent children, like Creepy Russ. I invite you‚Äîpeer into my crystal ball.

Trinity Church was where Salamander had his first experience in ministry, serving as the youth pastor. Although he saw the job as an uninteresting stepping stone that would make him look virtuous and serve as something to put on his r√©sum√©, that's when he met his solution: Creepy Russ.

An unmarried man in his thirties, more wretched than a disgusting troll, always hanging out with other people's kids, posing as a harmless mentor‚Äîbut never without his video camera. Always watching through his lens. Salamander saw what went on every Wednesday night but was all too willing to turn a blind eye. He simply didn't care about the horrors going on within the youth group. All he cared about was finding his replacement so he could focus on his real calling in life: furthering his own career.

So, Salamander decided to begin the transition and announced the youth group at Trinity would now start meeting at Creepy Russ's house, so Russ could further groom and prey upon young souls away from the eyes of the church.

Worst of all, one of the victims was none other than Salamander's own half-brother‚Äîpunished for what happened to him, his name no longer spoken, told to bury the nightmares he endured.

One day, Creepy Russ slipped up while volunteering with youth at the YMCA, following children with his video camera into the locker room.

What Russ saw as his own personal ""innocent home video collection,"" the judge saw as ""child exploitation."" He got out early on a ten-year sentence for ""good behavior.""

To this day, Salamander won't even admit he had a half-brother or his leadership role at Trinity, attempting to cover up his past sins.

But I think the mayor‚Äôs half-brother, whoever he is, would be glad to know I took care of Creepy Russ last night. Struck him down after he left this very coffee shop. I followed him home, and when he was sound asleep, I crept in through the window and pulled that monsters guts out and held it in front of his face so he could see how truly rotten he was inside. 

But right now, I should really stop daydreaming. I'm still on the clock.

Pastor Dan waves me over with a too-patient smile that makes my skin crawl. ""A moment, please,"" he says, his voice syrupy with a barbed edge. ""We need to talk about having a servant's heart. Our work here isn't just about coffee; it's about serving the Lord with humility and joy.""

I force a smile, though I imagine his face melting like wax. ""Yes, Pastor Dan. I'll keep that in mind.""

""That's the spirit,"" he says. ""You know, we appreciate your gift for crafting the perfect drink, but I feel you're ready for a new spiritual challenge. Jessica isn‚Äôt going to make it, so I'd like you to work the register. You'll find working with people even more engaging. Now, let's see that joy of yours, hmm?""

""I'm spellbound.""

I walk to the register and wipe my hands on my apron as my first customer orders.

""Coffee. Black.""

""Hot or iced?""

""Hot. Scalding,"" he mutters, pulling out a book titled Sword of the Lord.

""Interesting read?""

He sneers. ""It's Mayor Salamander's brilliant book. About rooting out the wicked‚Äîthe freeloaders, the heathens. All of them can go to hell in a handbasket if you ask me.""

I hand him his cup. ""I see. Must feel like a real witch hunt.""

""You bet it is. I can't believe some people want to act like The Black Hills Witch is some kind of superhero.""

""It certainly seems like magic, how she finds the criminals,"" I reply, smirking.

His gaze sharpens. ""Don't be fooled by tales of her so-called good deeds. She acts like she's above the law!""

I take a steadying breath. ""You may not like her, but you have to admit, she's only gone after bad people.""

""Doesn't matter. Magic is evil, and the Bible is clear: witches, their defenders‚Äîthey all deserve the same fate.""

""And what fate is that?"" My anger comes out of my fingertips, literally shocking my disgruntled customer. Oops.

His eyes are wide as he realizes what I am. Taking off the lid of his cup, he looks up at me, leaning in closer, and whispers darkly.

""To burn.""

With that, he throws his coffee at me, hot liquid splashes in my face. Pathetic. Little does he know, real witches don't burn.

Annoyed, I wipe my eyes on my apron as he scurries away. I could track him down, turn him into a toad‚Äîbut he isn't what I'm looking for. Just your average, run-of-the-mill coward.

Pastor Dan scurries over, voice dripping with concern. ""That's a nasty burn. We better pray about this. Let's all gather 'round and pray for healing, everyone.""

""I'm fine, Pastor Dan. I won't let one jerk ruin my first day.‚Äù My eyes steady as a candle flame.

He clicks his teeth in disapproval. ""We aren't called to use names like that about our fellow man. Remember our motto here at Bean Saved: 'Treat paying customers the way you would want to be treated.' I think someone needs a lesson in forgiveness. Why don't you go home, pray this over, and remember: let go and let God.""

""And what would Jesus do if someone threw hot coffee in his face?""

Pastor Dan's smile widens. ""Turn the other cheek.""

As I grab my bag, I glance back at the shop. The sign reads: We help those who want God's help. The very same words came from that reptile Salamander's mouth. I know what that really means‚Äîpushing everyone outside their flock deeper into the cold.

That's where they'll find me.",2,1732298053.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

Something tells me this has something to do with my mind, and my consumption of coffee. I bought a coffee machine around 2 years ago and my consumption skyrocketed. I was a chai drinker before (but barely). Over these two years, I got heavily into the fasting lifestyle...and my only solace was plain black coffee. So, maybe there's a connection there? Also, got really into sodas (went from having 1 once or twice a month, to multiple in a week). And just, a poorer diet compared to when I lived at home.

(Might delete this later) I just got my first acceptance to NYU Stern and I'm thrilled! I'm a nontraditional candidate and, over the last couple years, I've really enjoyed reading r/mba posts from similar candidates with nontraditional backgrounds. I always found it encouraging since there seem to be so few of us. So, I wanted to drop a post with what I found helpful, for anyone in a similar position.

**Stats**

* 32F, Asian American

* NYC

* 3.91 GPA from top U.S. art school

* GRE 328 (170V, 158Q)

* Roughly 11 years of experience in arts and entertainment - currently senior manager supervising high-volume locations for my arts and entertainment company. Have managed up to 140 employees 

* Seeking to progress in general management within the arts/entertainment industry

**What helped**

* **Coffee chats** - About 2 years ago, I started reaching out to as many people with BFAs *and* MBAs as I could find on LinkedIn. I started with alumni from my school and went from there. I would say that at least 50% of everyone I reached out to actually responded to me and were willing to have a conversation!

* **Fort√© MBALaunch** - Reposting my thoughts from another thread here - I don't think you need Fort√© if you're coming from a more traditional background and/or have lots of friends with MBAs. For me, though, I know only one person who got his MBA and I come from an extremely non-traditional background, so Fort√© was helpful in terms of understanding what I needed to do to make a successful application.

* **ApplicantLab** - Essays lifesaver. Easily the best money I spent during this process. I only wish I had started it earlier.

**What didn't help**

* **GRE tutoring** - I'll be honest, I really liked my tutor, but at the end of the day I only raised my total score by 4 points over my diagnostic test. Maybe I'm just really dumb idk. In any case, I could have probably spent less money here. I didn't retake the GRE due to demanding work obligations (I'm sure many of us can relate), and I hoped that I could make up for it elsewhere in my application.


**General thoughts on Fort√© MBALaunch**

* The program is mostly watching webinars with some self-reflection exercises, a couple in-person meetings, a pretty active Slack channel, and a peer group. 

* You likely will meet lots of other people through Fort√©, especially if you're in or near a major city. That was the best part, and I liked everyone I met.

* The Fort√© staff are also gems - so nice, and answered a lot of my random questions throughout the process.

* Finally, if you actually apply to 3 or more schools, you end up saving money through Fort√© because of the fee waivers. This alone would make the program worth it.




**Total costs $3713.77**

* GregMat subscription (10 months): $50

* GRE study materials (books + notecards): $80.35

* GRE tutoring (11 sessions): $990

* GRE practice tests from ETS: $79.90

* Drinks and snacks consumed during weekend GRE study group sessions and school visits: $218.59

* GRE: $220

* Sending GRE scores to schools: $105

* Fort√© MBALaunch (application fee + the program itself): $635

* School transcript: $19.00

* Transportation to visit schools: $55.70

* ApplicantLab: $314.10

* Application fees for 6 schools (saved some money on these through Fort√©): $500

* Suit for interviews: $241.63

Keep going,
you with the pages stacked like towers
and the coffee cold beside your elbow.
The lamp is small, but it is steady.
The room may feel narrow,
but your thoughts stretch to the horizon.

Here, in the thick of it,
you are more than you know:
a creature of purpose,
a builder of dreams.
Yes, the hours grow long,
and the questions tangle like vines,
but isn‚Äôt this also a kind of wonder?
To wrestle, to seek, to grow?

The goal you chase‚Äî
perhaps it feels distant,
like a bird slipping from view.
But it is not lost.
It waits for you
on the far side of this effort,
this grit, this stubborn hope.

And remember this:
you are not alone.
Every voice in this building‚Äî
every sigh, every pen‚Äôs scratch,
every whispered ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can‚Äù‚Äî

stumbling toward their own dawn.
Carry them in your heart,
as they carry you, unknowingly, in theirs.

If you know danganronpa  this is directly inspiried by it its takes the primise of danganronpa and adds reality show aspects to it 

Unlike in danganronpa when they are born with the talents  in my story  they are given them by a governing  body named TUA 

In the story TUA has existed for around  twenty years  however just before the events of the story TUA was took by new management  before they were no incentive to aceepting the award  now under the new management  by accepting the award you get to have a chance to get into a position win a lottery.

The letter doesn't  tell you what futher you have to do but strangely right  after they next leave their house  they are kidnapped and taken to an abandoned university  if you know danganronpa you know where this  is going. And then they have to do a killing game and the one that ends up surviving gets the money .

Dasom Seol: dasom treats zalia as a mother figure  which makes her uncomfortable 





Creators  synopsis:

Zalia  is an interesting character for  me as she doesn't like colour and doesn't wish to stand out  she has a mindset of if you need colour to add meaning  to something then  it didn't mean anything to start with.

 the reason why she shuts her emotions off  is so nobody can get though her shell of not caring as she realy cares too much to what people think of her.   

she was taught from a young age that modesty was key and her purpose as a woman was to be obedient to her husband and provide children for him. Her being a lesbain conflicts with this expectation  of her. 

She got famous from her drawing of a woman in shackles  crieing for help lot of people found out and  TUA ( the unrivaled administration)  gave   her of the unrivalled award of fine art. From then forward she was to be known as the unrivalled fine artist

I have very pale skin, so I thought that may be the natural color of my teeth, but the dirt build up is also bad, I went to tooth stone cleaning about a year ago, the dentist told me that the dirt up build up in my teeth was very bad before cleaning it, and after the cleaning, I kept on brushing my teeth regularly, but a year later, my teeth is still dirty and very yellow.

I‚Äôve been hovering around a BMI of 25 for a while and would really love to just be solidly in the middle of a healthy BMI (23 or so). This means losing 15 pounds. Goal is to lose it by October (my wedding). I‚Äôve made some sustainable lifestyle changes (did a week trial and feel good that I can keep this up) but I‚Äôm wondering if this is enough to see a difference:
-Get in 10,000 steps every day
-weight train 3x week starting the workout with 15 min cardio
-intense focused cardio 1x week
-intermittent fasting (between 12-8pm)
-cutting down alcohol to just one night/week
-cut down on processed sugar snacks/desserts

I eat a very healthy diet regularly and really enjoy cooking so I‚Äôm not sure if I need to change this. For example a typical day for me might look like‚Ä¶ 
-breakfast- coffee (fasting) 
-lunch- tuna w/crackers or leftovers or humus and veggies
-Mid day snack- apple w/PB or nuts and dried fruit
-Dinner- fish w/broccoli and brown rice or chicken fajitas or protein pasta LOADED w/veggies. I love veggies and try to make protein and veggies the majority of my plate",1,1732296906.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,1.0,False

Estou naquela transi√ß√£o que j√° vi muita gente relatar aqui no sub: deixei de lado os fortes e extra-fortes, n√£o tomo com a√ß√∫car e comecei a prestar mais aten√ß√£o no sabor.

Recentemente comprei um pacote de 250g do Mogiana Paulista da Tr√™s Cora√ß√µes, e curti bastante. J√° encomendei da mesma linha o Sul de Minas. O primeiro peguei a menos de 15 reais na Amazon (dei sorte), e o segundo a 17 por l√° tamb√©m. Estou esperando o Cerrado Mineiro da mesma linha entrar em promo√ß√£o pra experimentar.

No momento, n√£o quero ainda investir em equipamentos, apesar de j√° pensar em comprar um moedor um dia. Tamb√©m n√£o estou podendo gastar muito, ent√£o meu foco √© em caf√©s como essa linha gourmet da Tr√™s Cora√ß√µes que de vez em quando ficam a menos de 20 reais no pacote de 250g dele mo√≠do pela Amazon (frete gr√°tis importa muito pra mim, estando no Nordeste).

**Tem outras op√ß√µes assim, com bom custo-benef√≠cio?** Entendo que os melhores ser√£o mais caros, mas como estou ainda aprendendo a apreciar e ainda na ""transi√ß√£o"" dos caf√©s tradicionais para os gourmet, ent√£o quero explorar v√°rios sabores e tipos sem gastar demais. Mais pra frente, quando eu sentir melhor quais sabores mais me agradam, eu invisto mais. Por hora, ainda estou aprendendo sobre isso de corpo, amargor e acidez.

Como moro em Alagoas, o frete de sul/sudeste √© absurdo. Ent√£o as melhores sugest√µes s√£o coisas que fazem parte do Amazon Prime. Por l√° abaixo de 20 eu conferi agora e vi um tal de ""Pronova Coffee Stories"" e uns da ""Delta Q"" (Col√¥mbia e Cuba). Tamb√©m vi um da Baggio (o Bourbom; os aromatizados eu fico com p√© atr√°s, n√£o acho que sejam minha praia).

E a√≠, quais marcas e caf√©s voc√™s indicam dentro deste pequeno universo dos ""n√£o t√£o caros"" e que s√£o bons pra quem ainda n√£o tem equipamento e est√° aprendendo a saborear?",2,1732296868.0,cafebrasil,6,0.75,False

I don‚Äôt know what I thought would happen. Maybe I imagined some grand breakthrough, a way to make this *loop* mean something. To use this strange, stolen connection to rewrite the past, to tell Mom and Dad all the things I never got to say.

But this? This is a prison, and I can feel it closing in.

Every morning, I wake up, and it‚Äôs December 5th, 2004. The same gray sky outside my window. The same slightly burnt coffee in the pot I didn‚Äôt make. The same inbox, empty except for that one email waiting to let me reach across time.

At first, I thought I could handle it. I wrote Mom again yesterday. And the day before. And the day before that. She always replies, kind and curious, but every conversation resets with the day. She never remembers what we talked about before. I could tell her I love her a hundred times, and she‚Äôd never know I‚Äôd said it once.

It‚Äôs starting to feel hollow. The warmth in her words is real, but it doesn‚Äôt reach me anymore. I‚Äôm holding onto something that can‚Äôt hold me back.

And Dad? It‚Äôs the same thing. Every time I try to get closer, to say something real, he pulls away, confused by this stranger who knows him too well. The tighter I cling, the more I feel like I‚Äôm losing them all over again.

The worst part is the stillness. The world outside is frozen in place, but I‚Äôm still here, aware of every second that ticks by, even though I know they‚Äôll be erased tomorrow. There‚Äôs no future here. No progress. Nothing grows.

I tried ignoring the email today. Just to see if the world would feel different without it. It didn‚Äôt. The day still dragged on, empty and colorless. My life has become a book with only one page, endlessly reread, the ink fading a little more each time.

*""Would you talk to anyone, at any time, but at the cost of the rest of your life?""*

I didn‚Äôt understand what ‚Äúthe rest of your life‚Äù really meant. I thought it was a metaphor‚Äîtime spent chasing memories, dwelling on the past. But it‚Äôs literal. My life is gone, traded for this endless loop, where nothing matters because nothing *sticks*.

I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do this.

Talking to them used to make me feel close to them again. Now, it just reminds me how far away they are‚Äîand how far I‚Äôve drifted from anything real.

Meredith goes to pick her up from the airport, and they talk and drink coffee together. Meredith tells her about the Alzheimer's research she's doing, and then Cristina shows Meredith a huge brain tumor scan. She explains that it's her friend's tumor and asks if Meredith knows any neurosurgeon who can operate on her friend. Meredith obviously recommends Amelia.

Cristina meets with Amelia, and we discover that the tumor is actually Cristina's. While Cristina and Amelia talk and get to know each other, they fall in love but decide not to be together until after the surgery. During the surgery, Cristina almost dies, but Amelia refuses to give up on her. Cristina goes into a coma, and after a month, she wakes up. Then, they get together. Thoughts?

Our local grocery store only had Intelligentsia espresso beans, so I regret to say it, but we bought them for months. The espresso was sooo bland, watery and seemed diluted. We thought it was our machine, so we adjusted the grind/water settings and were constantly tweaking. We even reverted to making french press coffee because we were so underwhelmed with our machine. 

We recently moved (new grocery store) and have been purchasing Toby's estate espresso. It tastes just as an espresso should. Thick, strong. It was our beans the whole time!

We are currently reading Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi which I beleive is also a time travel novel.

1gxd2ff,https://www.reddit.com/r/OLED_Gaming/comments/1gxd2ff/samsung_g80sd_how_i_removed_the_matte_antiglare/,Samsung G80SD - How I Removed the Matte Anti-Glare Coating (WET PAPER METHOD),"I kept reading how risky attempting to remove the matte AG coating off monitors is, but whenever I read or watched anyone do it, they all said it was simple and relatively easy. So I channeled my ADHD and got out of my bed at 12:30 at night and decided I was going to go to sleep at 6AM.

Did it take balls? This is a 1,000 euro monitor and I was fully prepared to fuck this up and live with my decisions. I wanted a glossy monitor, and if this thing wasn't going to be it, I was buying another that was. If you arent completely happy with the matte finish, and you can't return/exchange/sell it, you should seriously consider this as an option.

Do not try this if you feel extremely anxious about the process, or you're not prepared to lose the warranty. Matte or glossy, this screen is beautiful and I'm convinced many people who own it will enjoy it out of the box. However, if you have any DIY skills at all, if you've put a PC together or whatever else, have confidence you can do this too. If you think matte is the work of the devil, then just remove it.

**What I used**

* Spray bottle with warm water
* Kitchen paper towel
* Microfiber cloth / t-shirts
* Sharp kitchen knife
* Cups of coffee and youtube videos of cute dogs

**How I did it**

I placed it down on its back without the stand, and covered the entire screen with two layers of kitchen paper towels. I then sprayed warm water across the paper ensuring it was wet but not soaking in water. I used a light book to gently press down each part of the paper to make sure there was contact evenly across the screen.  I waited four hours, every hour I checking to make sure it was still wet. Once or twice I sprayed a bit more water.

When I finally tried to find the edge of the coating and peal it up, I couldn't get it. I couldn't even find where it met the screen. I decided to leave it another hour. The second attempt was no easier, so I just said fuck it and used a knife to part the edge of the coating from the bottom left corner. I held the knife almost at the tip of the blade to control it easily.

I very slowly and very gently picked at the corner. It took some patience, but a tiny corner kind of turned plastic-y and I knew I had it then. I was able to slide the tip of the knife under the coating and lift up enough to grab it with my fingers. Note, I have small hands, this part will take longer if you have man-hands.

The coating goes right up to the silver bezel - that is, it also covers the black that boarders the edge of whats displayed. If anyone wants I can take a pic of the exact spot.

The coating itself was very well glued down. I have to say, it did not want to come off. I made sure to only apply force at the very part I was trying to separate, spreading my fingers on the monitor to spread the force, and working my way around more stubborn parts.  For example, there was one section near the start I almost left until the very end, instead working around the edges of the screen and coming back towards it at the end. I did it in a firm controlled way, rather than pulling at it or jerking it, if that makes sense. When I got the knack of it, removing the rest was straightforward.

Cleaning off the adhesive is a pain in the ass. It took way longer than pulling off the coating! I used warm water and a microfibre cloth. It seemed to just spread it around. On someones suggestion in Youtube comments I used olive oil on a cloth, so I tried that too. No idea if it helped. Eventually I got frustrated and grabbed a tshirt and surprisingly it immediately started to look better. I used two and made sure to not us the same part more than once. It still had some wipe marks, but I left it a few minutes and then turned it on, I cant see any of it anymore. In a few days I'll clean it again with isopropyl alchohol just in case.

**What I would do differently**

I've seen this done to laptop screens, and it just pealed off. Either the adhesive is stronger on the G80SD, or more likely I didn't allow enough water to seep through the coating. If I were to do this again, I would use 3 - 4 layers of toilet paper instead of kitchen paper towel. I believe it was holding too much of the moisture. Additionally, I would make sure the room was quite warm and the double check the water was warm every time I used it.

**End result - Wow**

I hope at least one person reads this and finds the confidence to give it a go. I waited two weeks of using it, I should've done it day one. I'm so confident in doing this, I would have no issue buying a matte monitor or laptop in the future and doing it again.

I'm very happy. It feels like I just got an entirely new monitor. I knew it would change the perceived black level and it did. Ive seen some people here say the greyish-blacks are mainly due to it being QD-OLED - that is 100% false.  The raised blacks are almost unnoticeable now,  even in a bright room. Yes, there are sometimes crazy reflections, but I don't notice them unless I try. I don't get eye strain.

What I wasn't prepared for was how crystal clear and sharp the monitor would look. It's difficult to describe.  EVery time I turn this on I get that Wow factor. There are times I'm watching something in 4k and I get distract by how beautiful it is. People say, well, to address the blacks just use the matte display in a dark room! Nope, it's still grainy-blurry. You couldn't pay me to use a matte display ever again. I'm convinced unless matte coatings significantly improve to the point they're not perceptible, they'll disappear completely from OLED monitors intended for the home. Samsung Electronics were smoking some strong stuff when they designed this thing.

\--------

(I should've taken more pictures to document the process. Or even recorded a video, but talking on camera is 100 times more nerve wracking than potentially destroying a monitor.)

Quick thank you to u/iiMayo who did the same thing. I wouldn't have wanted to be the first to try it on this monitor.

I recently upgraded my setup to a Lelit Bianca. I plan on buying a blind shaker and other accessories.

Basically I am looking for a tamping stand that could fit both stock bottomless and spouted portafilters that came with the Bianca and make them lay flat, as a flat botomless portafilter would. I want to acheive this so that when I drop the coffee from the blind shaker I can only focus on that action and not have to keep a hand on the portafilter.

Do any of you know of any such stands?

Thanks!

- ignoring

- keeping counter entirely clean of crumbs / dishes 

- ssscat automatic sprays 

- cat tree in kitchen so cat can ‚Äúwatch‚Äù (he doesn‚Äôt want to watch he wants to forage) 

- treats in cat tree so he understands he can forage there instead 

- tin foil (he eats it) 

- double sided tape all over counter 

- spike mats 

- baking sheets with water 

- turning the blender on whenever he jumps up (but he obviously knows now that it doesn‚Äôt happen when we‚Äôre asleep) 

We‚Äôre starting to lose our minds a bit here. Nothing has deterred him really, other than the extremely inconvenient things. Our counter is consistently covered in spikes and he will still jump up and throw the spikes onto the floor all night. The automatic ssscat sprayers worked for a while but he‚Äôs so fearless that now he just stares straight into the spray and doesn‚Äôt care, and they‚Äôre insanely expensive. I don‚Äôt care about him being anywhere else in the house, but I find cats on counters extremely gross, and I‚Äôm also just frustrated at this point that he has no Achilles heel lol. I would love for my counter to be the one place he just doesn‚Äôt go. It doesn‚Äôt matter how clean it is, he is food obsessed and will spend every second of every day looking for crumbs up there. 

My dream is to have the blender set up on a motion detector, but I‚Äôm not the brain to create that product lol. 

Is there ANYTHING anyone has found for an extremely relentless cat? I‚Äôm looking into making a lemon / rosemary / lavender spray for the counters and just making it smell super awful up there for him. But open to any other suggestions! 

Important note: he‚Äôs about a year and a half, was born to a litter of 9 kittens so food insecurity has been an issue for him, and is a bottomless pit for food. He will unfortunately eat absolutely anything, and I‚Äôm trying to keep him off the counter because we‚Äôve already child locked every single door he can open to food and the only remaining ones are the cabinets above for coffee and tea and spices which he still thinks are food and will eat. Also he can get behind the fridge from on top of the counter and we can‚Äôt cat proof that area enough. I hardly sleep when he can get up there because I am constantly worried he will get into something. I‚Äôd just really love for this space to be cat free and worry free.

Ive been looking at some budget options to start roasting coffee here in Canada and came across this unbranded roaster which is under 100$ CAD. I can't seem to find any reviews and in a perfect world Id get the Sweet Maria's Popper holiday Bundle but the shipping costs as much as the bundle. 

Here are its specs:  
Specification:  
Item Type: Coffee Bean Roaster  
Material: ABS, Stainless Steel  
Weight: Approx. 2760.00g/97.36oz  
Product Size: Approx. 31x13x13cm/12.2x5.12x5.12in  
Voltage: 110V US Plug  
Frequency: 60Hz  
Power: 1300W  


Does anyone have experience with this roaster or how do budget Canadians get started? I was looking for an Amazon option since Canada Post is on strike but other options are great too.

Thank you!

1gxcoj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1gxcoj7/kendu_army_proven_strong_now_rises_grab_the/,"Kendu Army Proven Strong, Now Rises. Grab the Candle before it leaves you behind.","Ah, young warrior army, Kendu Inu ($Kendu) moves with the precision of a master shinobi, poised for a parabolic rise. The recent market dip? It was no defeat. It was a moment of quiet preparation before the strike hits when the Ethereum-based token completes the bridge to the Solana, Base, and Sui networks.

Whale movements in a down market pushed the price lower, shaking the trees to startle the weak-handed holders. While emotional traders fled like startled villagers, the whales moved in the shadows, gathering $Kendu with calculated precision. After the recent shake, the top 100 wallets now hold 50% of the supply. These seasoned warriors of the market knew the dip was an opportunity to seize strength, not surrender.

The whales‚Äô accumulation lays the foundation for a powerful surge. Their disciplined moves show they believe in the long-term path of $Kendu. The coin dropped, but not to zero, and has already begun a parabolic lift to glory fueled by the same community that survived the whale attacks, and joined, now, by those very whales who are lifting up the price. 

As traders, the only way to survive as a ronin in a sea of big money mercenaries is to stay calm, and hold and accumulate during down cycles. Kendu followed the rest of the market down, but the big players took this opportunity to accumulate at a huge discount on the failure of the weak to hold.

Now, the battlefield is dominated by those who see clearly and hold their positions with resolve. The path to victory is paved by the patience of warriors who stand firm.

# Even in the quiet of the market dip, $Kendu‚Äôs strength remained unshaken:

* **Kendu hit an ATH of 300 million market cap in a bear market.** Imagine what happens when the bulls come! The same market forces that lifted SHIB into a household name are back to change the game with Kendu Inu!
* **Kendu Chads NFT Marketplace** sharpens its edge as a challenger to OpenSea, proving its worth in the crypto dojo. Even a small piece of the NFT action will be a huge boost in revenue to Kendu true believers!
* **Kendu Cards** bring ease to the warriors who wish to acquire $Kendu, with no-KYC options that make the way more accessible. These tools are the secret weapons that elevate $Kendu beyond a mere token‚Äîit is a force of innovation.
* **Kendu has real world branded products for sale**. Kendu Inu Energy Drinks are for sale right now! Kendu Inu Coffee is moving out to market. Kendu Kush is for sale where it is legal in the USA. More products are coming. The Kendu Bazaar is live with all kinds of community-generated merch.

The community of Kendu Inu is the alpha that leads the army, but that quality and energy unlocks a spirit force. Whales are the stealthy vanguard, their moves unseen by the untrained eye. As they gather $Kendu, they prepare the market for a breakout. Their accumulation signals that the next wave is near, a swift and powerful strike that will capture the attention of all. The battle-hardened army has proven itself to the market movers, and the patient holders will be rewarded.

The Kendu Army is disciplined and unshakable, ready to flood the markets with their resolve. Under the leadership of Kendu Miazaki, their strategy is clear, their goals unwavering. Like a band of shinobi, they operate with precision and unity, ready to seize the day.

The recent dip was a rare opportunity, a breach in the market‚Äôs defenses for warriors to enter. Whales moved silently, collecting their positions, while those who hesitated are now left watching from the shadows. The market is coiled, ready to spring into action. Grab your piece of the action, if you can. There is only one way from here.

# Kendu Inu is not a fleeting trend; it is a disciplined force, building its strength in the shadows. With whales as silent masters, an unstoppable ecosystem of tools, and the unwavering Kendu Army, the rise of $Kendu is as certain as the strike of a ninja. The moment to act is now‚Äîthose who hesitate may never see such an opportunity again.

DYOR and check the etherscan data and you'll see it, too. The army holds the line while the whales move in to reinforce the line, getting ready for the next leg up. Volume has never been higher, and the price of Ethereum with the bridge to Solana imminent suggest that the next leg up can be huge.

I'm in my last few weeks of CE school, passed my civil FE 1st try, and I have work experience dating back to 2021 as a survey I-man where I pretty much strapped on the boots anytime I had a week off of school. Worked through pretty much every spring summer and winter break. I'm a competent I-man with a strong understanding of the math/concepts and can run+adjust my own traverses, do my own layout and topos with little help if the job isn't extremely complex. I think I could be a really good party chief very soon.

I'm worried I'm getting caught in HR filters because of this. Maybe they don't know that surveying is the other half of the equation, and they jot me down as ""no civil work experience"" even though most people I know with civil internships were c3d labellers and coffee getters. Having worked in combined civil/survey firms, I know that my combined ~1.5 years of experience is extremely valuable to a PE, probably more-so than someone who did a  single three momth summer as a civil intern. I know 3 months isn't enough to make you familiar but my friends with that kind of experience are getting offers.

If it's also worth noting I have a 3.2 cumulative gpa, but a lot of that is brought down by the covid years when I didn't give a shit about chemistry/calculus & wanted to drop out to go survey. My gpa from the last two years is closer to a 3.5 (I put major & cumulative on the resume). At least it's above 3 though and I feel like I should have gotten something back at this point with an entire resume chock full of of work experience. Maybe it's because of election season but I'd really start to like working by Jan/Feb and it's looking bad for that.

I'm fairly strong on roadway geometry too thanks to senior design. C3d & ORD exp is also on my resume. I would say I'm familiar and competent with these, not an expert.

FOREVER YOUNG

An 17 year old boy named Angel who just started his fall break for Halloween from school and studies decides to try and get a job gig at his local famous cafe in Brooklyn to help his mom Carol at home. angel gets ready for his job interview with his mom in the bathroom. Are you nervous? His mom asks. No mom, i know i`ll get the gig, don¬¥t worry. After your father died, we have had a really hard time so this means a lot to me Angel. Mom says. I know mom, you and dad are the only reason i am doing this. Now get ready fast honey, you¬¥re gonna be late. Mom says. That¬¥s true, shit! I gotta run! Angel dresses up and flees from the door to catch the subway. 

As he enters the cafe, Mariah, his boss greets him and they sit down at the table. Angel explains his family situation and Mariah hires him right away, because her mom died when she was very young too and she had to work at a very young age also. She gives him his first shift for tomorrow. Angel takes it and happily exits the cafe calling his mom and telling her he got the job. Carol screams from exictment and say that they are going to celebrate tonight. At home they have a nice evening together.

First day at work on Halloween Angel prepares for his first shift and makes it there in time. At the cafe Angel is greeted by his co- workers Isabela, a 20 year old college student and Alice a 21 year old college student aswell. How you doing it¬¥s so nice to meet you newbie! Isabela says excited. Angel introduces himself to the girls and they start sharing their life stories and interests in life. Isabela wants to be a famous influencer and Alice a flight attendant. They ask Angel, and he is not sure yet, but they assure him that it¬¥s okay he is still very young and has a lot of time to figure it all out. A group of college boys walk in, Mike 19 years old, Isabelas boyfriend, Mason 20 years old, Mikes roomate and best friend and Ross 20 years old, also Mikes roomate and good friend. The boys come greet them and Isabela runs to kiss and hug Mike at the door. Isabela introduces Angel to them and they greet him very welcomingly. The boys order coffees and go to sit at a nearby tabel to study and chat, while Angel, Isabela and Alice continue working. Alice shows Angel all the basic things of tha cafe and tells him that she is very happy that he decided to take the job and is helping his mom and says that they really needed some fresh faces here. 

It¬¥s evening and the cafe is coming close to the closing time and the boys get up to leave ans Mike says he will wait for Isabela at the near restaurant for their evening date togehter and Isabela can¬¥t wait. The boys and all the other customers leave the cafe and Alice goes to lock the doors as Isabela is counting the cashier, Angel is cleaning the tables and floors. All of a sudden they hear a loud bang in their staff locker rooms. Angel gets scared, as there isn¬¥t supposed to be anyone else at this time. Alice says that something just probably fell and that she will go and check it out. Isabela asks to go with her but Alice tells her to stay and show Angel how the cash is supposed to be counted. Isabela agrees and she tells Angel to come and pay attention. Alice goes downstairs. Isabela tells Angel that she has heard weird things before too, but hasn¬¥t thought much of them before. Their phones beep and they see that an escaped convicted serial killer has escaped from captivity from the local pshyciatric prison. Isabela gets really scared and tells Angel that what if it¬¥s him who is downstairs. Isabela panics for Alice and tells Angel that they need to go check out if she is okay so they go together downstairs. As they are making their way down the stairs, the power suddenly goes out and there is no light. Isabela screams and takes Angel by the hand, Angel holds her hand tightly and says that this is terrifying. Angel screams for Alice, but Isabela tells him to be quiet incase the killer is here. They are downstairs and search for Alice but she is nowhere to be found. Angel suggests that they go back upstairs and call the police. Isabela agrees and they do so.

Upstairs they try to call the police, but have no service. Isabela gets irritadet and says that they should get out of the cafe and see if they have service there, but they find out that somehow the doors are also locked from inside, meaning that they are trapped in the cafe. Isabela gets desprate and asks Angel why them and not anyone else in New York. Angel tries to calm her down. 

At home Carol starts getting worried for her son and tries to call Angel, but it goes straight to voicemail. She sees the news and immediatly puts her jacket and starts to walk to the cafe, as the subway is busy from the Halloween party goers. 

At the restaurant Mike starts to wonder as to why Isabela is late because she usually never is and it¬¥s already past 10 pm. He tries to call her, to no response. Mason calls and tells him about the news. Mike realizes that his girlfriend might be in danger and tells Mason and Ross to get ready and meet him at the cafe.

Back at the cafe Angel and Isabela knocking at the backdoor of the cafe. Isabela goes to see who it is and it¬¥s a man who looks straight at her and drags Alice¬¥s dead body from the trash bin outside, all cut up and mutilated. Isabela screams and drops to the floor crying. Angel gets up and goes to see if she is okay but by the time he gets to the backdoor the killer has already disapeared but left Alice¬¥s body close to the window. Angel terrified helps to get Isabela up as they hear another knock on the front door of the cafe and see that it¬¥s Mike and the boys. Isabela runs to the door crying and tries to tell Mike to break the window but they can¬¥t. Mike tells her that they will find another way in as they go around the cafe. Isabela goes to take a seat and Angel follows and tells her that it is going to be okay and that they¬¥ll make it out alive but Isabela cries and says that ALice didn¬¥t deserve that and that she was a very good person at heart. Angel understands and tells her that they need to find out what¬¥s happening here instead of sitting around. Isabela shrugs and agrees and gets up to and they together go back downstairs to try and find any clues as to what happened and how. Downstairs all of as sudden the lights come back on and Angel sees the unknown man behind Isabela and screams watch out as he is about to stab her, she turns around and gets slashes in her arm. Angel sees the emercengy exit downstairs and goes to open it just as Ross comes in from it and tells them to run as the killer runs at Ross and stabs him repeatedtly and couges his eyes out and eats them. Angel and Isabela scream as they run out of the cafe to Mike¬¥s car. Mike finds them and Isabela tells him that Ross is dead and to not return back to the cafe, but Mason gets mad and tells her that he is going to kill that son of a bitch who killed his best friend. Mike tries to stop him but Mason runs back inside. 

Mike, Isabela and Angel get into Mike¬¥s car but find out that the tires are flat just as the killer appears in front of the car with Mason¬¥s head in his hands. He throws his head at the windshield and they all scream as the killer tries to break in the car to kill all of them. Isabela screams from terror and Angel starts crying. The killer breaks the drivers window side and drags Mike out of the car. Isabela gets out of the car and begs the man not kill him. PLEASE DON¬¥T KILL HIM! She begs screaming the man stops and speaks for the first time. So you think i should kill you instead? He asks. Isabela cries and asks him why is he doing this to them. The man starts laughing and tells her that because it¬¥s Halloween as he stabs Mike in the stomach. Isabela screams- NO!!! Angel gets out the car and tackles the killer and yells to Isabela to grab the knife. Angel struggles with the man as he starts to strangle Angel. Isabela grabs the knife and runs toward the killer to stab him but the man gets up and draws out another knife from his pocket and stabs Isabela in the neck. Angel screams but he has almost lost his voice as Isabela drops to the floor. The man turns to Mike and stomps on his head several times until his brain is exposed. 

A car arrives and Mariah steps out of it screaming but then starts laughing maniaclly and applauts the man for his work. It is revealed that all of what has happened throughout the night has been orchestrated by Mariah.  She looks at Angel and says that Halloween has always been her favorite time of the year so this year she decided to come up with this kind of trick. Angel screams at her telling that she is a pshycho bitch. Mariah laughs and say it¬¥s Halloween, what did you excpect. She alsos adds that she got sick of Isabela¬¥s and Alice¬¥s whoring selves and has been wanting to kill them for a long time. Isabela on the ground tries to get up but Mariah is quick to draw a gun and shoots her three times in the head, killing Isabela. Angel cries loudly and Mariah tells the man to kill Angel.

Angel gets the power to get up just as the killer is about to stab him and he dodges the knife and hits the killer in the face. The man drops to the ground. Angel grabs the knife but the killer grabs his hand and twistes Angels hand almost breaking his wrist. The man get on top of Angel and starts to stab him in the stomach. The man stabs Angel four times. Carol runs at ther man but Mariah grabs her by her hair and tells her that her sweet boy is going to die right infront of her. A tussle breaks between Carol and Mariah that leads to Mariah shooting Carol in the leg but Carol getting the gun and shooting Mariah right in between her eyes, killing her.  The man runs at Carol but she shoots him five times in the head, killing him aswell. Carol start to scream for help and calls 911 crying. Carol checks at Isabela but she is already dead. Carol picks Angel up and they start making their way down the road calling for help as the police sirens are seen in the distance. 

The End.

Anyone else this way?

Also, I think b12 deficiency affects my GI. My symptoms got worse after dropping below 500.

Charles wakes up slowly, groggy. Sleep had eluded him last night, and now the sun beams harshly through the cheap plastic blinds, stabbing at his eyes. He blinks a few times until the beige carpet beneath him begins to take shape. The textured walls of the room feel stifling, and his gaze lands on the battered tiger oak dresser in the corner‚Äîa relic from the late ‚Äô90s, inherited from his parents when he first moved out on his own.  

His hand gropes for his phone on the mattress beside him. *2:49 p.m.*  

‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù he mutters under his breath, rubbing his face. He tells himself, as he has many mornings before, *I need to start getting up sooner.*  

The afternoon haze lingers as he pulls himself off the bed and shuffles into the living room-kitchenette combo‚Äîthe second of the three rooms in his small apartment. The third room, of course, being the bathroom. But hey, at least he‚Äôs not living with his parents anymore. And it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre in the same city, either. Small victories.  

He powers up both his PC and his laptop, a habitual motion. As the machines hum to life, Charles struggles to refocus. Where had he left off last night? No, wait. Yesterday. He remembers now. He had been toggling between forums, managing his cluster of fake identities. The British one, he thinks, has potential. He skims his saved tabs: a few forums for gamers, a couple masquerading as middle-aged women in some parenting group. Harmless, he tells himself. Mostly tips and cheats, bits of idle chat.  

Discord pings softly in the background. He clicks through the notifications lazily. His cat meows, weaving between his legs, and Charles sighs. Coffee. He needs coffee.  

The ritual is second nature. The drip machine sputters to life as he opens the fridge to assess his options for food: a jar of sauerkraut, mustard, a carton of spoiled milk, and some leftover Taco Bell. Breakfast of champions, he thinks dryly as he grabs the Taco Bell bag and tosses it onto the counter.  

While the coffee brews, his phone vibrates. A work group chat. But another notification flashes‚Äîa message from his mom.  

A Snoopy hug sticker. ‚ÄúLove you. Have a great day.‚Äù  

His jaw tightens. His chest buzzes with irritation. The memory of last night‚Äôs argument with some troll on Reddit resurfaces, clear as day. They‚Äôd dared to call him a ‚Äúmama‚Äôs boy.‚Äù *As if,* he fumes silently, the indignation sharpening his focus.  

What about his life screams ‚Äúmama‚Äôs boy‚Äù? Nothing. He doesn‚Äôt even talk to his parents that often. Well, maybe once or twice a week. But they‚Äôre the ones who always reach out. And sure, they visit sometimes. His mom had even brought plastic silverware and groceries the last time they came, two weeks ago. She was always prepared like that. It had been a really nice evening.

But no. That doesn‚Äôt mean anything. His grip on the Taco Bell wrapper tightens as the thought grows louder. He slams the fridge door shut, muttering, ‚ÄúRidiculous. Doesn‚Äôt even fit the profile.‚Äù  

Charles stares out the kitchen window, looking past the cheap vinyl blinds at the brick wall of the neighboring building. His mind drifts, unbidden, to a tally of time. How long has it been since he‚Äôs had sex? A couple of years, maybe more. He‚Äôs stopped counting. The thought is dull, like static.  And friendships? Organic ones, not work-adjacent acquaintances? Even longer, he realizes. 

The cat meows again, snapping him out of his thoughts. Charles reaches down to scratch its head before shuffling toward his desk. Wearing the sweatpants and polo shirt he fell asleep in last night, he sits heavily in the chair. The coffee is still brewing, the Taco Bell untouched.  

He logs into his forums again, clicking through threads. The glow of the monitor bathes the room in a dull blue light. Somewhere in the back of his mind, a question stirs: *Is this what ten years looks like?*  

But Charles doesn‚Äôt dwell. He cracks his knuckles, and types his next reply to the troll. ""Mama's boy? Hardly.""",2,1732294470.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1gxcej3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1gxcej3/how_to_decorate_a_small_living_room_with_sofas/,How to decorate a small living room with sofas?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience and some cool tips on decorating small living rooms with sofas. After moving into my tiny apartment, I learned a lot about maximizing space while keeping things stylish and comfortable.

First off, choosing the right sofa is crucial. I spent weeks researching and finally found some amazing space-saving options here: https://athometouch.com/sofa. The key is to look for compact designs that don't overwhelm your space.

Here's what worked for me:

1. Go for lighter colors
I picked a light gray sectional that makes my room feel bigger. Dark sofas can make small spaces feel cramped.

2. Consider modular furniture
Flexible pieces are game-changers! You can rearrange them based on your needs or split them up when hosting guests.

3. Floating furniture
Instead of pushing everything against the walls, try floating your sofa. It creates better flow and can actually make the room feel larger.

4. Multi-functional pieces
My ottoman doubles as storage and a coffee table. Smart, right? You can find similar space-saving furniture at https://athometouch.com/sofa

5. Use mirrors strategically
Placing a mirror opposite your sofa creates an illusion of more space and reflects natural light.

6. Proper scaling
I learned this the hard way - your sofa shouldn't take up more than 1/3 of your living room. Measure twice, buy once!

7. Create zones
Even in a small space, you can create distinct areas using area rugs and strategic furniture placement.

Pro tip: L-shaped sofas are perfect for small spaces because they provide maximum seating while utilizing corner space effectively.

For accent pieces, I stuck with:
- Slim side tables
- Wall-mounted lighting
- Compact throw pillows
- Vertical storage solutions

Remember, less is more in small spaces. Don't overcrowd your room with too many pieces. Focus on functionality without sacrificing style.

I hope these tips help you create your perfect cozy space! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm happy to share more specific details about what worked in my space.",1,1732294441.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Not pregnant 

I've battled with acid reflux in the past, this evening I took a PPI. Didn't seem to help.

I'm constipated, I've had x3 macrogol sachets since yesterday. Nothing has happened yet.

Earlier this week I had a highly stressful moment and I've been battling with my stomach ever since. 

I am able to pass gas here and there, and there's plenty of burping. 

The nausea usually improves for a few minutes after I burp. 

The nausea comes and goes, but if I drink coffee or eat (even something tiny) I become rather nauseous.

If I lay down and press on my stomach, I can definitely feel some hard situations. But I can also feel things starting to soften (if that makes sense.)

I have no idea what to do at this point or what the problem is. I'd really like to be able to eat something and get some relief. ",2,1732294384.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

So for starters I live in Tennessee and have grown up in Tennessee however my dad‚Äôs family is from Louisiana. I have grown up on Cajun dishes ranging from jambalayas, gumbos, √©touff√©es, catfish dishes like catfish Atchafalaya, shrimp and grits, red beans and rice, and the list goes on. So I‚Äôm wanting to open a business that is primarily Cajun/country themed here in Tennessee to represent my family heritage. The only problem is that I cannot think of a name or logo and was wanting some opinions and inspiration. So for starters what I‚Äôm going to sell is honey that I raise and make myself, coffee that I import and roast the beans, eggs, homemade syrup that I‚Äôm making this winter, homemade yeast bread, jams and jelly‚Äôs, fruits and vegetables and later down the road when I‚Äôm more established I want to sell home raised meats like beef, chicken, pork and maybe bison if I want to get into bison farming. I want to do breakfast in the morning like beignets and other French pastries and bread. I also would like to do a lunch every Friday or Saturday that will be some sort of Cajun dish for people to enjoy. I‚Äôll also sell spices, local Louisiana sauces and chips, frozen seafood from Louisiana and maybe ingredients and Louisiana brands. So overall I‚Äôm wanting a Cajun/country general store, cafe, farmers market type deal with everything being homemade and homegrown. Now for a name and logo I was wanting something to reflect my Cajun heritage as my family has a great record spanning back to the 1600‚Äôs with much of the family being French, with Spanish, Scottish, basque and even middle eastern decent noted but the bulk of the family was from burgundy France and other regions and settled around Baton Rouge/New Orleans. So I‚Äôd really like something to reflect this in the business.

1gxc7q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1gxc7q9/the_whistler_at_night/,The Whistler at Night," As a kid I had always heard scary stories about the unknown, the unexplainable, and simply things purely out of imagination‚Ä¶ well at least what I thought was. A lot had changed from that time when I used to crawl and hide under my bed covers after hearing the stories of ghosts haunting a house or a demon possessing someone, I was 30 now. I had more things to worry about like taxes, house payments, or simply what would be hurting by merely laying a wrong way in my sleep. God, what I would give to be a kid again, so innocent and free of worry. Sometimes I have to think to myself if it‚Äôs my youth I truly miss or if I would rather have never lived through that night. It was a Monday with the same schedule as always; wake up, make coffee, feed the cat, go on duty. I had been in the local police force for some years now and loved every second of it. Not a lot went on in a small town like Bridgewood except for the occasional noise complaint from some old folk or giving a speeding ticket to a reckless teenager just getting out of class. The town was boring but, nice and after all it was my home. My shift would be the same every day, starting at 11 and ending at 7 and I liked it since it kept me occupied for the majority of the day. In my opinion, family was never a big goal of mine and my cat, Snow, was the only company I needed. After my shift, I came and waited for Snow to greet me with his daily round about my leg and if I was lucky he would give me the pleasure of not having anything to clean in the litter box, today was not that day sadly. My apartment was small but just right for a man and his cat. I made sure to get on the third floor so I could see over the town but not too far away from the ground to chat with any strangers that may have been walking on the sidewalk. Sitting on my lounge chair on my balcony I looked at the sky which now was bleeding a bright orange with the darkness of the sky waiting its turn to take over. After about 3 hours of watching movies and playing with Snow, I decided to call it a night. Going around the apartment I turned off all the lights and enjoyed the silence of my home before going to close the door toward the balcony. Then I heard the whistle. Every night I heard the whistle that seemed to echo through the streets and raise the ears of Snow. As weird as it sounds this was not anything out of the ordinary to me as each night I heard the same whistle, in the same tone, at the same time. At first, moving into the apartment I noticed it but figured it was a resident letting the town know it was time to sleep and I still believed this since I had grown accustomed to the nightly tone, how could I have been so stupid? The warnings should have been evident when I had asked one of my neighbors about the whistle and if they had known who it was.

‚ÄúWhistle? I‚Äôve never heard a whistle in my life around here at night,‚Äù she stated with a puzzled look.

‚ÄúWell I know I‚Äôm not insane‚Äù, I awkwardly laughed feeling like an idiot,‚Äù Must be a coincidence or maybe I‚Äôm just simply misjudging the noise. Oh well, thank you anyways.‚Äù 

	Looking back I realize how much I tried to cover up the mystery of that noise just to make it easier for me to sleep at night, God what an idiot I was. In the back of my mind, I guess I never was fully at ease with the idea of the whistle but at that point, I had come to reason that there was a simple reason for it. What I could never come up with a reason for however was how each night the whistle seemed to sound closer. There was not enough of a difference to prove it was closing in at an alarming rate at the time but in a week you could tell that there was no doubt it was closer. Most nights I had no dreams and seemed to look into the nothingness in my sleep but that night was the start of what feels like the pivotal point of my life. To this day I can remember in my dream being on top of a building and I could tell that it was in my town. I recognized the building I was on top of as the city bank which was roughly about a mile or two from my apartment. The weird part was that the whole night I just stood there staring in the direction of my apartment, the only way I knew this was because I could see the roof of the complex from where I, or whatever I may have been in the dream, was standing. That morning I woke up with a sense of fear and happiness, but I wasn‚Äôt sure why I was happy. It was odd that my entire dream was me looking at my apartment complex which scared me a little but there was no need for me to be happy. This feeling of happiness didn‚Äôt feel as if I was happy from something I had done, yet but for something I was going to do, but what?

	Looking past this feeling I decided to get dressed, feed Snow, and start my shift. I made sure to drive past the bank and just as I thought when I looked on the roof there was nothing. My day went on normally and once again came back and sat and waited for the time to pass by. Looking at the clock I saw it was about 10 which meant not only was it time for bed but for the nightly whistle to help start the night. Stepping onto my balcony I waited and as always heard the whistle jump over the rooftops to where I was standing, but for some reason I wanted to try something. Instead of taking the sign to call it a night, I decided to respond. Attempting the same tone I blew a whistle right back and made sure to make it loud enough that the mystery source could hear me. Minutes passed with no response which added to my suspicion of maybe a broken clock somewhere or an animal of some sort. Snow looked at me with disapproval as he carried on eating his food. Going to sleep took a while but surely enough I was back staring into the black abyss, or at least at first I was. I was once again on a rooftop but my apartment was now visible from wherever I was standing. It didn‚Äôt take long to realize I was now on the rooftop of an apartment complex directly across from where I lived. In the dream, I once again just stood there silently until a whistle could be heard coming from whatever I was seeing the perspective of. Within a second I shot up in my bed to the faint sound of the same whistle echoing through my apartment. I looked over to see Snow with his ears up creeping around the corner to the hallway which went to the living room. Following him I preceded with caution with the same feeling from the previous morning but they seemed more intense. As the room began to open up there were no signs of any life except for both me and my feline bodyguard ready to pounce. With a sigh of relief, I continued to walk back to my room but remembered the image of where I, or whatever the hell I was had been standing in my dream. I made my way to my balcony and looked at the complex ahead of me trying to let my eyes adjust to the night sky filled with the occasional star looking from above. I didn‚Äôt dare open the door if whatever I dreamed about was real but I soon realized my childish thoughts and decided to walk out. Leaning over the railing I squinted my eyes looking over a building to see something straight out of hell. A dark figure could be made out on the roof across from me with its head tilted slightly and its arms to its side but hands facing outward. Before I could look further into it I saw it crawl to the side of the roof not visible to me and then it was gone. My palms were drenched with sweat and my knuckles seemed like they were about to burst from my skin as I tightened my grip on the railing. I felt like I was in some sort of movie or hell or maybe I was simply still dreaming. Slapping myself I came to the conclusion none of these were true keeping my eyes on the roof that the creature was standing on. I wouldn‚Äôt dare take my eyes off it til I saw the sunrise in the morning. This was until I heard a whistle from down below. 

In an instant, my eyes shot down to the pavement to see the most hellish sight I had ever seen. The creature stood there at the door to my complex with the moonlight helping express each disturbing feature as it stood there staring at me. It had kept the same posture as when I had seen it before but this time I could make out a crooked smile with what seemed to be split down the middle. Its mouth was wide and its lower lip split making its crooked teeth that formed the smile uneven. Portions of its head were uneven and while one eye seemed normal the other was split in half but had two pupils staring down into my soul. Blood ran from all over its body and from the third floor I could hear, and to this day still hear, the dripping of blood into the pile it stood in. Its arms were long and the legs were backward like a dog but yet the worst of all was that it in some way resembled me. This creature looked as if I was looking in some misshapen mirror made by Satan himself and every part of me wanted to puke but I felt as if I couldn‚Äôt alert it. Whatever it was had been calling to me through a whistle, maybe it was a countdown, maybe it was a warning that it was closer, or maybe it just simply wanted me to suffer. These thoughts rushed through my head until it started to beat its head against the door while keeping its smile towards me. Once I heard the bang of the door slamming open the creature let out a demonic laugh as it began to crawl to the entrance. In an instant, I slammed the door to the balcony and ran to my main door to lock everything I could. After the final lock, I backed away to notice two shadows under the door from the other side completely still. Blood began to slowly seep from under the door when I heard a muffled and slow whistle on the other side. A jolt of fear went down my spine as the door began to shake violently and Snow began to hiss almost as if knowing what lay between us and the door. I ran to my counter and grabbed my gun hoping that whatever it was wasn‚Äôt bulletproof but when I turned around the door slowly opened as Snow looked into the doorframe. Before I could even get back I saw a fleshy hand grab and yank Snow into the hallway with a quick final hiss then‚Ä¶silence. Frozen in fear I aimed my gun at the door and could hear the creaking and squishing of bones and muscles being ripped and bitten into. I had no idea what the hell this thing was but one thing was for sure, it was not a creation of God. Focused on the door something was flung on the floor in front of me and as I looked I could only make out a few white spots of fur and the split head of what used to be my only companion. Focusing back on the door the creature was peering around the doorway looking at me with a chuckle that made blood splatter out its split mouth. By now I would have been about waking up to start my day but this creature was going to make sure that would never be the case again. I tried to ask it questions with a tone of pain and fear but all I could get was the response of its crooked smile as it slowly crept over to me trying not to hit its head on the ceiling above. Cliking my gun to fire I pulled the trigger and aimed in on its chest where a heart would normally be as a loud crack went around the whole room. Stopping for only a moment it continued to get closer as we were now in the hallway and it was using both its arms and legs to make its way to me. Again I shot but aimed in on the god-awful smile to hear a screech that was made from the depths of hell. This moment of victory lasted for about a second when the creature now began moving quickly toward me at the end of the hallway as it continued to screech. Curled up into a ball I could see the details of its torn and bloody flesh each step it got closer and closed my eyes accepting the cruel fate that Snow had. A moment passed when the sound of my panting and the silence of my apartment were the only things that could be heard. I opened my eyes to see nothing but the sunset and the corpse of Snow in the living room. By this point, the gunshot had awoken my neighbors and a couple walked into the gorey sight of the cat but yet no sign of the creature. Maybe it was the light that saved me or some angel that decided to step in but I will never forget that night. I was kicked out of the apartment complex, for obvious reasons, and moved to another city in hopes the monster was confined to that city or maybe I scared it off. I still to this day cannot describe the events that took place that night or how it was gone but at 10 each night I can still hear a whistle from far away, waiting to pounce once again or waiting for me to let my guard down. Though I cannot assure you of a way to get rid of it my only suggestion for those who read this and hear a whistle at night is to pray, because at that moment the devil is coming for you.

I had a French press and a Moka. I really liked them, especially the first one, however I want something different from them. I can't decide between a Chemex (expensive here in Brazil, almost 1/3 of minimal wage - a bit less than what I paid for AeroPress) and Clever, which is cheaper yet expensive. Fact is that Chemex, another dripper, and I have no idea the coffee I get from it. According to what I read, the result is clearer than V60. Clever is just like French press, although its result is clearer, with no oils.

The feeling of breaking something called The Fourth Wall. It's like I got an awareness to see something new. Well, about The Kurechiians, there are 3 people. Starting from Mr. Ywei, he's the Director of Kurechii. He's in charge of curating the world that I lived and guiding his team to make sure his team in the right direction.

I think she is the True Creator of the Noxies. Sapphire and her Artists are the one who created the world that I'm in.

Mr. Kung is also a huge math's and science fan, he likes to learn about the universe. And he's also a Coffee Enjoyer, though I'm not really a Coffee Enjoyer, but I stick to Coffee 'cuz of my narcolepsy. Talking to those Kurechiians was really nice to know them, sometimes I wonder if there was a REAL world, like a REAL world that the player who controls me is live in. I want to know what is it like. Sometimes I think those Kurechiians are like Gods or Creators, I mean not like Goddess Eolin, Klarsten the Aegles' God and Psyonix the Wyords' God. Well that's all of it.

**Restarting eternity.**

¬†

Will rushed to the thief mirror. At the end of his previous loop, he had had a long discussion with Alex regarding the limitations of the thief class. Mainly, Will was curious whether he could use mirror copies to level up faster. Sadly, the goofball claimed that to be impossible. A mirror copy was great at mimicking a person in appearance, but when it came to anything else, it was useless. Even using them in combat was a clear exploit of the skill. Individually, even sneaking copies were little to no threat at all. When turned into an army, on the other hand, things changed drastically.

‚ÄúWhere are you rushing off, weirdo?‚Äù Jess shouted in laughter as she watched the boy flee, as it were. ‚ÄúBathroom‚Äôs the wrong way.‚Äù

The joke made Will chuckle, though not for the reason the girl intended. Right now, there was a very strict sequence of events that had to be followed in the precise order.

¬†

**You have discovered THE THIEF (number 3).**

**Use additional mirrors to find out more. Good luck!**

¬†

The golden message appeared in the pole mirror. From there, Will instantly used his sprinting ability to dash back into school unseen, and claim the rogue, knight, and crafter class in that specific order.

Not a single person noticed him as he passed by. The coach remained in a foul mood as Will passed by him in the corridor, but this time, the cause was someone else. Even the nurse didn‚Äôt notice him enter the room, tap the mirror and leave. Given how tight her office was, this was an impressive feat and further proof of how good the thief‚Äôs starting skills were.

With all four classes, Will rushed to the nearest open window and leaped out. The rogue‚Äôs precision and knight‚Äôs endurance ensured that he didn‚Äôt suffer any pain or injury. Rolling along the ground, Will quickly hopped up, sprinting again to the outside parking lot where he‚Äôd gotten the thief‚Äôs class. Only this time, his goal was to gather as many car mirrors as possible.

The crafter skill came useful in that, letting him pull off the car parts as if they were clipped on. Not a single car alarm was set off, and everything other than the mirrors themselves was quickly tossed to the ground.

From that point, the boy rushed to a very specific coffee shop, where he sneaked into the bathroom, though not before tossing a few mirror traps.

Being in a corner room, the mirrors reacted as they were supposed to, causing a massive wolf to appear. The beast had barely time to step out when it got stuck on the ground by a trap and swiftly killed by a strike in the neck. If anything, it was a greater problem to pull the wolf away before the next creature appeared.

It was curious how Alex had managed to stash them away. Through his knight‚Äôs strength and rogue‚Äôs reflexes, Will managed to kill off the entire pack and keep things quiet. His friend wasn‚Äôt supposed to have any of those skills but had managed, nonetheless.

Will waited patiently for the wolves to fade out, looking at his phone‚Äôs clock the entire time. Four minutes remained till the standard end of the loop, which meant he had to be back at school in less than one if he were to extend it.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he whispered, then tapped the mirror in the room twice.

The first level up went to the rogue, granting him the skills to leap, throw, and evade. The next was dedicated to the crafter.

By then, the wolf corpses had become semi-transparent. From what Alex had told him, no one ever went to the bathroom, so it was safe to just leave. Having only one loop to fulfill his goal, Will decided to make sure.

His pulse had doubled to the point that he could hear it in his right ear.

¬†

**WOLF PACK REWARD (random)**

**WOUND TOLERANCE: One wound you receive doesn‚Äôt count.**

¬†

The reward was exceptionally good, but right now, Will would have preferred a one-hour extension. Gritting his teeth, he sprinted out of the coffee shop, running towards school.

With three minutes left, the only thing he could do to urgently boost his loop was to get into a fight with Jace. Normally, that would attract too much attention for the loop to be efficient. Thankfully, there was a way around it.

Will took out his phone and dialed Jace‚Äôs number.

The jock didn‚Äôt pick up on the first two rings. On the third, the much-awaited click sounded.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he asked with the grace of a rhino.

‚ÄúMeet me in the basement!‚Äù Will shouted. ‚ÄúQuickly.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? I gave you my class.‚Äù

‚ÄúI need to extend my loop!‚Äù

The end of the call suggested that Jace had picked up on the urgency of the situation. Despite their differences in the past, he had become a team player. Also, he had become just as aware as everyone else that favors among looped were precious.

By the time Will got to the school basement floor, Jace was already there.

‚ÄúYou never make things easy, Stoner,‚Äù he said, taking off his football jacket. ‚ÄúHow long do you need it?‚Äù The jock‚Äôs fist split the air, flying right for Will‚Äôs face.

As things stood, such a hit would only have resulted in the jock breaking his hand. He was fragile, not to mention that Will had just got the reward to ignore one hit. The point wasn‚Äôt to fight, though. Every successful evasion increased the length of the rogue‚Äôs loop, so the more that took place‚Äîthe better.

The minutes wound down. The two boys kept ‚Äúfighting‚Äù until they heard the school bell sound throughout the corridors.

‚ÄúShould be enough,‚Äù Jace said, taking a step back. Both of them were breathing heavily. ‚ÄúWe can go again after art, to be sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm good.‚Äù Will brushed the sweat off his forehead. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo prob.‚Äù The jock slapped him on the side of the arm. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one more you owe me.‚Äù

The bareness of everyday class took over. Helen had ended her loop at that point, leaving her non-loop self to continue. This time, Will didn‚Äôt dare bring up the news about Daniel. He did approach her, though‚Äîpartly to check how she was doing and partly to make sure she didn‚Äôt remember any of the things he had said in the previous loop. To his relief, she didn‚Äôt seem to.

Alex was also suspiciously quiet. This was one of the few instances in which Will could be relatively certain that his friend was the actual original. More curious, though, the goofball kept on eating muffins to increase his own loop.

Once school was over and most of the people had left, Will decided to spend a few hours of light in the schoolyard. He wasn‚Äôt the only one, but since none of the other looped were here, he didn‚Äôt mind.

Reaching into his pocket, he took out the mirror fragment.

‚ÄúI challenge you,‚Äù he whispered.

His reflection was instantly replaced by Daniel‚Äôs.

‚ÄúProblems?‚Äù the former rogue asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Will replied without thinking.

‚ÄúWhy call me then?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat favor do you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúFavors. Plural. And it‚Äôs too early for that. You need to get out of the tutorial first.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you have completed it.‚Äù Will knew perfectly well that wasn‚Äôt what Daniel was saying, but he decided to push him a bit to, hopefully, find out more.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôve completed it or not, as long as you didn‚Äôt start it.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me about the wolves,‚Äù Will shifted topic. ‚ÄúWhat exactly are they?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou seriously called me to ask‚Äî‚Äù Daniel abruptly stopped. His eyes widened in surprise for a few moments, then returned to normal, a smile appearing on his face. ‚ÄúWell done.‚Äù He clapped within the mirror. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not as stupid as I thought. I‚Äôm not sure what will happen. I‚Äôve only heard it being done once before.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom the magic user?‚Äù

‚ÄúMagic user?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how you described him to June. Able to juggle balls of fire, but not affected by them.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been reading my file.‚Äù The smile vanished, replaced by a frown. ‚ÄúDid Alex make you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe showed me your file. I found the patterns.‚Äù

‚ÄúNever trust Alex about anything. Especially when he talks.‚Äù Daniel paused. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about the mage. He doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. As for the wolves, they are markers. You‚Äôll see when you‚Äôre out of the tutorial. Until then.‚Äù

The former rogue gave a salute and vanished from the mirror‚Äôs surface. Next thing Will knew, he was staring at his own reflection again. The conversation wasn‚Äôt at all what he had imagined, but it had told him several bits of important information. For starters, while Danny had the power to disappear at will, it didn‚Äôt look like he could appear unchallenged. Second, despite trying to create an impression to the opposite, he didn‚Äôt know everything that was going on outside of the mirror realms. Most likely, he had been connected with the school mirrors and nothing more.

With nothing left to do until dark, Will was tempted to challenge Danny again so they could continue their conversation. Giving the matter a bit more thought, he decided not to. It was telling that Daniel had glimpsed his immediate plan, even if he claimed he‚Äôd never done it. On that note, maybe it was a good idea to find another wolf mirror. Killing another pack would allow him to gain one more level, which he could use to increase his knight‚Äôs level, gaining the horizontal slash skill.

Finding a suitable corner mirror turned out a lot more difficult than one might imagine. For starters, Will couldn‚Äôt just go in there, for it would trigger a wolf‚Äôs attack. And, while that wouldn‚Äôt cause him any difficulties, it risked creating a commotion.

Keeping close to the school, Will scouted a few potential spots. The most common places to have mirrors were bathrooms, and those were obligatory for every food joint. The trick was to find one with a low number of patrons.

The first two that fit the bill ended up not having corner bathrooms. The third was a different matter entirely. Will placed a few mirror traps just outside the door, in case someone tried to enter while he was fighting. Then he sneaked in.

It didn‚Äôt take long for the wolves to emerge and almost instantly die. Killing them had become rather trivial, although they continued to be of the smaller variety. The ones he remembered from beyond the school area were as big as buses and a lot more vicious.

The reward earned from this pack granted him night vision. That, too, was rather useful. This way, he wouldn‚Äôt need to rely on flashlights or his phone for light. More importantly, it let him boost the level of his knight.

Evening came and went. Now, it was time to go through the school.

The fights were a lot easier there. If nothing else, he didn‚Äôt have to be as sneaky and quiet as in the coffee shops. Pack by pack, the wolf mirrors were cleared, providing him relatively useful skills and two level ups which he used to get his crafter to the coveted Combat Crafting skill. With that, everything was ready.

Activating the inventory of his mirror fragment, Will geared up, then took out all his weapons, including the chain. He also got his wolf key fragment. The item looked like a simple old-fashioned key made entirely of silver. It had never been specified if the fragment could be used on any mirror, so Will touched it to his mirror fragment.

The only result was that his hand disappeared within it, returning the item to his inventory. When he attempted the same on a bathroom mirror, a keyhole emerged within the reflective surface.

Holding his breath, Will pushed the key inside and turned it.

¬†

**WOLF CHALLENGE: enter the mirror and survive nine waves. A defeated wave doesn‚Äôt provide any reward, but increases the overall prize you‚Äôll earn. You can end the challenge at any time by leaving the mirror.**

¬†

A green message appeared. This was it. Now, he‚Äôd be able to test his skills. The entire group had managed to clear four waves last time. Soon, he‚Äôd see how many he could defeat on his own.

I‚Äôm in my late 30s but i started accumulating debt since 19 so its been almost 2 decades. I thought it was an amazing way to have some freedom and buy a few things I couldnt really afford and I‚Äôd magically be able to pay off later!¬†

I had no savings and no emergency fund, so for these I started using my overdraft and got approved for another credit card. This was the tipping point for me. I could not pay for any emergency, a car repair and a large vet bill for my lovely dog. Before I knew it, I had ¬£10,000 in debt across cards and my overdraft.

I stopped¬† opening my banking apps and opening post¬† because seeing the balances gave me so much anxiety. I eventually met someone and this was the kick i needed. I was hesitant to share my financial situation but it came up eventually when we started spkeaing about life plans. I felt super low after she offered to help me pay it off. t i just couldnt accept it, i knew it was my responsibility and i didnt want to burden someone else and be stuck like this forever. i knew i had to deal with it head on and now in much better place for it. 

Wanting to share this with you guys as so many helpful people have spent time on here to help others and i know what its like so here it is:

After spending countless hours scrolling through reddit, personal finance blogs and social media for advice, i finally found what works for me. Note it may not work for you but just sharing what did it for me¬†

More money!¬†

Found all the stuff I had (of value) that I didnt use and flogged it on Vinted and Marketplace. I did a lot of surveys for cash and switched bank accounts as they would sometimes offer ¬£100-¬£150

I signed up to any app that offered me ¬£5+ and tried it get it out (kind‚Äôve embarrassing but i asked friends to give me the cash and swapped them access to my account/giftcard if you‚Äôre not able to withdraw)



Saving and budgeting!¬†

I¬† created a spreadsheet of all my spending and sorted them into categories like ‚Äúessential‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-essential.‚Äù I then started tracking things with apps (there are loads of these, check this subreddit or google it, find what the ones that are good for you. I tried a bunch and stuck with monzo for spending) now i could see what was going in and out clearly and cut some useless things (was spending ¬£10 a day on lunch and coffee, and had 3 tv subs 2 of which i never used).¬†

Cooked more which saved loads.. but that didn‚Äôt stop me from getting some freebies from restaurants close to work which gave them out for downloading the app or referring a co-worker.. that‚Äôd be money saved off of the grocery bill anyway most of the lunch spots give you something if you download their app (make a new account each time you want to use but doesn‚Äôt always work)¬†



Credit¬†

The interest rate had all lapsed so all balances were costing a fortune. I tried to consolidate but didn‚Äôt qualify. was rejected for a consolidation loan with updraft

then found incredible and that worked for me. I chose to do snowball in the app and it makes 1 payment for all each month. Only works with credit cards so couldn‚Äôt add overdraft.

Keep a separate list of everything you owe (find/buy spreadsheet online if need be)

Previously used clearscore but find it very hard to use now



¬†Travel costs

I downgraded each transport method e.g. bus instead of train, or walk instead of bus. Obv only do this if you can, i didn‚Äôt live far away from where i work/friends so easier for me.the point was to see your day to day spending as a way of finding ways to save money. Like how far can you stretch it if you REALLY had to. There is no invisible money tree thats going to appear and solve all your problems so take action asap¬†

This changed my mindset and i really want to make each ¬£ count

I‚Äôm proud of my progress, and i looking forward to a big fat debt zero balance. Hope this helps!¬†",111,1732293171.0,UKPersonalFinance,32,0.95,False

It‚Äôs a lot of work especially when it comes to shifts they only place certain people that know how to open and close which is annoying because that leaves others not open to learning both and can make it hard for ppl like me to call out and for them to find someone who ironically knows how to do the job.. so I just got my schedule and I am only working two days‚Ä¶ I always have 4 day shifts and last week I called out for only one day because I had really bad period cramps and they know how my period is really bad. Now I see my manager took that same shift I called out from completely from ever being in my schedule,and my boss told me it was because I kept calling out.. mind you others call out so many times and they never had that happen to them and they have made drastic mistakes leading to money loss and having us fail the first health inspection because of their carelessness and just doesn‚Äôt seem to care about the job so it seems unfair how I just called out two times for that same day and I get it revoked like it‚Äôs normal to do. I‚Äôm usually very respectful and nice and a great worker so I feel like they take advantage of that which should be the opposite of what they should do and just split my shifts down from 4 to 2 days. Mind you I don‚Äôt even get paid a lot. My other co worker who isn‚Äôt the best at her job gets paid more than me and she didn‚Äôt even need to ask I felt so annoyed like why am I still doing here?

I have had my current setup for about 3 years and it serves me well enough.

I am the only coffee drinker at home. 

I am considering upgrading my grinder and wonder if it‚Äôs reasonable. While I make good enough coffee I don‚Äôt make anything as good as I can have in good coffee shop. 

So my question is: is there a grinder out there that would help me make significantly better cups consistently or do I have something good enough that any upgrades will probably be placebo effect and the fun I can have playing with a new toy?

Budget wise: I would go up to $500. Wouldn‚Äôt mind an electric one if it was quiet (I wake up much earlier than my spouse and don‚Äôt want to feel cautious about using my grinder in the morning).

This is completely down to the protein and not a MJ side effect, I'm sure about that.

Why am I disappointed? Because today is injection day! Strange though it may be, I look forward to my jab every week. And I've been anticipating today because it's my first 5mg dose. 

I'm just so disappointed that I already feel crappy and don't know whether to delay the injection. I'm autistic, I like schedules, and Friday is injection day.

And it was a success!

Here I am sharing it with you, especially since thanksgiving is coming, and some of you may be wondering what to bring and the dinner.

¬†

250g walnuts (shelled)

150g Maizena (cornstarch)

4 eggs

200g (two sticks) butter

16g backing powder

Sugar 200g

170g (¬Ω bag) chocolate

Tools: mixer, oven, cake pan, blender, sift

1)¬†¬†¬†¬† Bring the butter to room temperature. You want it soft, not liquid. An easy way it to take two sticks out of the fridge before going work, they should be ready when you‚Äôre back.

2)¬†¬†¬†¬† Mix 200g the softened butter with 150g sugar. You need to get it ¬†fluffy and smooth.

3)¬†¬†¬†¬† Blend the walnuts with the chocolate chips (not all) and the remaining (50g) sugar. Keep some chocolate chips aside for later.

4)¬†¬†¬†¬† While the butter is mixing weight in a bowl the sifted cornstarch and the backing powder.

5)¬†¬†¬†¬† Use the remaining butter to butter up the cake pan, and the dust it with some extra cornstarch.

6)¬†¬†¬†¬† Everything is ready for the final steps. Add the eggs (one at time) and make sure is properly mixed. Add one teaspoon of vanilla extract

7)¬†¬†¬†¬† Add the blended walnuts/chocolate chips

8)¬†¬†¬†¬† (facultative) At this point I added a couple of spoons of coffee liquor and honey (not part of the original recipe)

9)¬†¬†¬†¬† Add the cornstarch with the backing power in the end and mix well.

10)¬† Pour on the cake pan and cook 350F for 50minutes to 1 hour. At 50 minutes stab it with a toothpick and if its wet (and the cakes still wobbly) gave it 10-12 more minutes.

Take out, let it cool and enjoy.

I (21m) was dating a woman (27) in NYC for a couple of months.

I‚Äôve never been a huge romance guy, but I fell in love with her the moment I first saw her. Our first date was supposed to be a 1.5hr cup of coffee, which turned into an all-day date. It was like something out of a romcom.
From there, we started going out at least once per week and agreed to be exclusive. The exclusivity/intimacy happened very early.

It was the perfect situation: we both had 
orientation toward our careers, and we would speak on the phone every night after our long days of work. By one month in, we were planning getaways, holidays and vacations together. I thought that she was the one, and vice versa.

Two months in, we had our first fight, and she decided that she wanted to ‚Äútake a long break‚Äù. This came out of nowhere, and I was very hurt. I thought she was finished entirely with us, so I decided to focus on my career even more. I‚Äôm a chef, and I was given an opportunity (that I took) to cook in one of Europe‚Äôs finest 3 star restaurants.

When she found out about this, she told me that she was very hurt and upset, because she thought I wanted nothing to do with her. I explained that I thought she felt that way about me, which is why I took the position in the first place. To make matters worse, she‚Äôs in the US on a work visa and is currently unable to leave the country and still maintain her status.

Now, we‚Äôre in relationship limbo/purgatory. I‚Äôm leaving after the new year, and she still wants to talk and have some sort of ill-defined relationship, even though we‚Äôre not formally together at this point. She‚Äôs giving me a bunch of mixed signals, which is stressing me out. If I knew that she wanted to get back into a relationship, I‚Äôd choose her over the job. She‚Äôs just not being clear on what she wants, and I can‚Äôt throw away a definite once in a lifetime opportunity on a potential relationship. However, if I move to Europe, we‚Äôd essentially be completely finished.

Has anyone encountered a career v. relationship situation before?
