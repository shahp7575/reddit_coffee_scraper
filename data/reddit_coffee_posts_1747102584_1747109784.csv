1klcxlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1klcxlb/new_dress_code_day_1/,New Dress Code Day 1,"Honestly after today i’m just so tired, and I feel like I just need to say something because i’ve seen so much hate over people being upset about the new dress code. Which honestly yeah, they kind of should be. Everyone has their own reasons for being upset about it. I can’t speak for everyone on this but i’m upset because I literally had to buy a whole new wardrobe last year, because when I started working there I realized I had no non ripped jeans or plain t-shirts because my last workplace was more lenient and truly didn’t care what we wore, but that’s still not the point. When we officially start working at starbucks, we don’t receive much other than our hat and aprons. No shirts unless your manager actually gives you some, it’s not required. During this time I had also just moved from another state months prior and had so little money, I didn’t have much to spend on new clothes but I still had to. I was able to get a couple of $5 shirts from target that fit the dress code then, only to find out a year later that I have to buy more shirts because I don’t own black shirts? And to get reprimanded earlier because the color of my pants are fine, but the decals I have on it (same color, they’re nothing offensive, they are literally the same denim as the pants) are not okay? That’s insanely wild. And sure, all places have uniforms. This isn’t what it’s about. We get it, all places have uniforms. But OTHER work places also provide shirts the moment you start. If we want starbucks issued shirts we need to order them from coffee gear, and spend our **OWN** money. Starbucks doesn’t give us shit. This time they gave us 2 free shirts, but how does that make up for the money we spent on shirts that no longer fit our uniform, whether you purchased from the site or not? They literally had sales still going right before they announced on the site, and I know some partners are upset because they purchased these shirts only to not be able to wear them? It is a little insane and those who don’t think we have a right to be upset about it can go respectfully shove it where the sun don’t shine because I don’t wanna hear anything about it anymore.",1,1747109683.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

1klcwum,https://www.reddit.com/r/FORSAKENROBLOX/comments/1klcwum/what_are_your_head_canons/,What are your head canons?,"Here's a list of my head canons!

Forsaken Headcanons!
-
• John and Jane were created by two separate MODS, as Builderman created John and Doombringer created Jane!

• Builderman saw John as a son, and was absolutely devastated when he found out about his corruption. I like to believe that he tried to get rid of the code instead of eliminating John, but didn't have time as they were forsakened.

• John and Jane Doe knew each other from childhood and later got married!

• The reason why John ended up fusing himself with debug code was because of rumors that stemmed from his temporary association with a hacker at some point, most likely Noli or 007n7.

• Even though C00lkidd fears John, John Doe would never hurt him and even fights himself when the urge to do so comes out.

• Jane was a sweetheart and was the only one to notice the changes in his behavior right away, and took care of him since the corruption caused symptoms that were of similarity to the flu.

• Builderman blames himself for not knowing about the Spectre sooner, although Shedletsky makes sure to reassure him that it's not his fault.

• Telamon created 1x by accident as a test, and had planned to get rid of him since he wasn't responsive or conscious at first, but soon became attached and couldn't bring himself to do it.

• 1x, once he was given a complete consciousness, was quite lively and enjoyed being hugged or played with. However, he absorbed negativity like a sponge for some reason, which caused him pain that Telamon would often have to treat.

• 1x doesn't completely recognize Shedletsky as Telamon, but senses familiarity in him. But no matter, before he was forsakened and 'abandoned', he still saw Shedletsky as his father!

• 1x was fueled by Shedletsky's hatred to a point that he felt betrayed when he wasn't treated and it caused him to turn into what he is currently.

• C00lkidd was born from debug code that Noli accidentally created through the void star long after him and 007n7 had departed, and because he didn't know what to do with him, he sent him to 007n7.

• C00lkidd is naturally skinny for some reason, but 007n7 tried his absolute best to try and see if he could get him to gain weight but it never worked.

• 007n7 had a personality disorder that made him considered unlikeable to most people, which is why Noli and him clicking and becoming partners was so strange.

• 007n7 would often times forget to feed himself, but ALWAYS remembered to keep C00lkidd fed!

• 007n7 feels bad for everyone invading Elliot's pizza place for fun, but never apologized since he doesn't think he deserves forgiveness and also because he's actually socially awkward.

• 007n7's constant zoning out with his mind being elsewhere after he became forsakened is a direct result of how he offed himself.

• 007n7 can't hide his thoughts or inner turmoil since his GUI will always call him out on it by viewing what he's thinking.

• 007n7 absolutely DESPIESES Noli's void star with a passion since it reminds him of how he lost him to it, but he'd never destroy it.

• 007n7 probably enjoys cosmic brownies and sweetened coffee, although he's almost never seen with these things!

• Guest 1337 is requested to be far away from both Chance and Taph whenever they place or shoot anything due to his PTSD. Incase he does have a bad reaction to said noises, 007n7 has the best knowledge on how to calm him down.

• Guest 1337 doesn't eat much, but he likes to munch on sun flower seeds!

• Some of Guest's nerves are burnt from fires and explosions that he experienced when he was at war.

• Elliot never forgave 007n7, but he would occasionally offer him pizza for C00lkidd. As of being forsakened, he still doesn't forgive 007n7, but he does pity him and acknowledge that he's trying to change for the better!

• Elliot was an extremely skittish and jumpy worker.

• Two Time's real parents are unknown, but he was raised by Amarah.

• Two Time took interest in bugs, mostly because weetles reminded him of Azure.

• Two Time doesn't see many animals, and those that he does know of he's probably spooked by since he was told that many of them were dangerous by Amarah.

• Two Time is somewhat okay with bunnies, and actually thinks that continental giants are magical!

• Two Time has back problems and pain because of his tail and wings, but he never complains about it.

• Amarah was always unhinged because of the fact that his father was the original leader, and far worse than him. He really did care for Azure and Two Time, but mentored Two Time more and lived in fear of what the Spawn would think of him if he loved something more than it.

• Spade reminds Chance of Mafioso.

• Chance is extremely lonely no matter what, and ALWAYS views everything as a game no matter the circumstances, which was a result of his helicopter parents.

• Chance probably has permanent burn marks on his arms from previous and more minor explosions from his gun.

• Chance, despite understanding ITrapped's nature, still misses him to an extent.

• Doombringer was a more violent MOD, but had such a soft spot for Jane that he even questioned himself at some point.

• Doom probably enjoyed beef jurkey.

• Noli was a theater kid and enjoyed performances and perfection, although he was insecure of his face and often wore a tragedy mask. He was also on edge in college because he was taken advantage of.

• Noli doesn't hate 7n for quitting hacking, after all he's the one who left C00lkidd with 007n7, but he felt betrayed and abandoned when they completely separated.

• Noli's mind as of current is so broken beyond repair that it's a miracle he recognizes 007n7.

• Noli is a nostalgia freak, and would probably have enjoyed Invader Zim!

• Azure had a massive sweat tooth, but because he was unsure if it was against Amarah's rules or not, he would often satisfy this by consuming PB&J's on a day to day basis!

• Other than nightshade, Azure also enjoyed forget-me-nots, which soon became Two Time's favorite flower!

• If Azure tries hard enough, he can communicate by himself without the Spectre through the same hat that controls him.

• Azure's hair is, surprisingly enough, still fairly soft and fluffy despite the rest of his body being goopy!

• Noob is a big enough foodie that he's also a nervous snacker!

• Noob is the second oldest out of the group, but often skittish much like Elliot, so they get along well!

• Whenever Noob sees Guest 1337, he feels safe around him.

• Noob feels familiarity around Guest 666 in his current state, but he doesn't recognize him until he's close enough.

• One of Noob's favorite snacks would probably be some form of bitter and light dessert!

• Noob has a lot of obscure interests that he only ever shared with Guest 666, and as well as this, he was also a big yapper!

• Guest 666 is split between being a monster and beast-like and being completely chill.

• Guest 666's favorite type of caramel was probably salted caramel.

• Guest 666 will always be hesitant to kill Noob, but will end up doing it in the end even after prolonging it due to the Spectre's influence.

• Guest 666 likes cats!

• Dusekkar was a very imaginary person, especially as a child!

• Dusekkar is the strongest survivor, or at least was, until the Spectre severely nerfed him mid round after he almost killed one of the killers.

• Dusekkar is the most serious survivor, but if he weren't fighting for his life and others, he'd be one of the nicest fellows you've ever met!

• Dusekkar was in search of someone important to him.

• He and Taph get along since Dusekkar knows sign language.

• Taph is almost completely mute, but he can occasionally speak, it's just extremely ineligible and low.

• He was raised by Telamon and then handed over to Builderman to aid him, of which he ended up getting attached to Builderman!

• Taph has autism, likely on the center spectrum.

• Taph likes to make stacked rainbow waffles with sprinkles, and probably also likes dirt worm cakes!

• It's a miracle that Taph didn't become a hacker or exploiter, seeing as if he enjoys destruction, and if he doesn't have any bombs or weapons of destruction, he'd somehow create his own.

• Taph is considerably one of the weaker aids, and as such, Builderman always makes sure to put a chest plate and arm protection on his beneath his cloak to ensure his safety if he happens to get too close to his bombs!

• The Ringmaster was and still is enigmatic just like Two Time.

• Ringmaster probably saw what happened to the 900 other people who he got killed before he ended up dying himself, and probably has hallucinations from guilt that he doesn't know how to deal with since he's almost never felt it before.

• Ringmaster is extremely prone to adrenaline rushes, of which he thrived from, hence his liking for dangerous stunts!

• Ringmaster is lonely and his circus was the main thing that helped fill the void.

• Ringmaster probably enjoys peanut butter or cheese and crackers!

• Bluudud used to hate C00lkidd, but he eventually warmed up to him when 118o8 made him and C00lkidd hang out together.

• Bluudud has trauma from cars due to being hit by one.

• Bluudud acts as an older brother to Pr3typriincess and C00lkidd!

• Bluudud enjoys downright DIABOLICAL food combinations.

• Pr3typriincess loves tea parties, but makes you the most horrific and gut wrenching stories if you allow her dolls or toys at the table.

• Pr3typriincess takes interest in fashion and exaggerated clothing, but sticks to simplicity.

• Pr3typriincess sorta lives with C00lkidd and Bluudud, as she was offered a sleeping bag and some supplies by C00lkidd per 007n7's permission and travels with it!

• Jason does have an adult mindset, but he experiences age regression that can be triggered by nearly anything that reminds him of his trauma.

• Jason likes soup because it reminds him of when his mom would feed him on his sick days!

• Jason is nearsighted, but only by a bit.

• Jason can speak, but he doesn't because it puts intense strain on his vocals.

• Jason would enjoy s'mores, but only if someone else was making them since fire sets him on edge.

• Jason is quite curious and clueless, although this is only shown when his age regression shows through!

• Jason likes soft and warm blankets because they remind him of his mom's warm hugs.

• Jason would've babysat C00lkidd if he had known 007n7 prior to being forsakened.",1,1747109605.0,FORSAKENROBLOX,1,1.0,False

1klcvs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GearheadGatherings/comments/1klcvs4/eli5_how_does_a_cars_fuel_injection_system_work/,ELI5: How does a car's fuel injection system work compared to a carburetor?,"Okay, so imagine a carburetor is like a really simple, old-school perfume atomizer. It uses the engine's vacuum (sucking power) to pull fuel into the airstream. Air rushes past a tiny opening, creating a low-pressure area that sucks up the fuel from a little bowl. The downside? It's pretty imprecise and affected by things like altitude and engine temperature, leading to less efficient fuel burning.

Fuel injection, on the other hand, is like a modern, electronically controlled perfume dispenser. An electronic control unit (ECU), the car's computer, uses sensors to figure out exactly how much fuel the engine needs based on factors like engine speed, temperature, and how far down you're pressing the gas pedal. Tiny fuel injectors then spray a precisely measured amount of fuel directly into the engine's intake manifold or even directly into the cylinder.

Think of it this way: a carburetor is like trying to pour just the right amount of sugar into your coffee using a spoon that's attached to a water hose, based on how hard you're blowing through a straw. Fuel injection is having a robotic arm, with perfectly calibrated scales, precisely measure and add the sugar based on a computer analysis of your coffee and your preferences.

The sun had barely blinked over the trees, soft light just starting to settle on the dew-covered field when Barbara cinched her sneakers tight and tugged on her cap like a general ready to lead a charge. Jeremiah yawned wide enough to swallow a bug, then slapped his thighs with a whoop.

“Elijah,” he said, squinting toward the gravel trail curling through the hills like a sleepy serpent, “why we sign up for this again?”

Elijah chuckled, steady and warm like black coffee, “For the children’s hospital, Jeremiah. And for your heart. It’s been squeaking louder than your Sunday shoes.”

Barbara snorted. “Don’t worry, I packed a defibrillator—just in case your jokes start killin’ folks.”

So off they went, feet meeting dirt with purpose. The local charity walk was a modest 5K through the woods behind Pinefield Church, but you’d think they were trekking across Jordan River the way they carried on.

THE ROAD TEACHES, IF YOU LISTEN

“I swear,” Barbara said as they hit the first incline, “this right here feels just like living like Christ. Uphill, uncertain, legs burning.”

Jeremiah groaned dramatically, dragging his feet through the dust. “There are definitely times you wanna throw in the towel.”

“Throw in the towel? That all you got?” Elijah cocked an eyebrow. “I’m about to hang up my cleats.”

“Pack it in!” Barbara chimed.

“Call it a day!” Jeremiah countered.

“Chuck it all and go raise goats in Montana!” Elijah added with a wild grin.

“Oh, y’all ain’t ready,” Barbara said, stretching her arms with fake elegance. “I declare, I am at the end of my rope.”

“Stick a fork in me, I’m done!” Jeremiah fired back.

And on they went, trying to stump one another with the most old-school, oddball phrases for giving up. It turned into a game. A loud, wheezing, laughing game. The woods echoed with their nonsense.

“Latin!” Elijah barked as they crested a rocky ridge.

“Abdicare!” Barbara shot back. “To resign! Look it up!”

“Spanish—me rindo!” Jeremiah said proudly.

“Greek—παραίτουμαι!” Elijah responded, panting a little harder now.

“French—je laisse tomber!” Barbara wheezed, wiping sweat from her brow. “Literally, ‘I let it fall!’ Like my patience with you two.”

The trail snaked downward, and the dusty path gave way to a soft, pine-needle floor. The laughter softened some as the incline eased, and the air grew cooler under the thick canopy.

They passed an older man wearing a faded ball cap and dark glasses. His gait was stiff, but determined. He’d been behind them a while—close enough to hear, far enough to stay out of their chatter. They gave him a friendly nod, and he gave a low grunt.

Jeremiah leaned over to Elijah and whispered, “That was the international sound of disagreement.”

Another grunt from the man behind them. Elijah kept walking but smiled slightly.

WHEN THE RACE HITS THE WALL

As they reached the halfway point, the trail curved up sharply. The hill looked like it had been built just to humble folks. Barbara squinted at it.

“This here’s the kind of trouble that makes you want to cut corners,” she muttered.

Jeremiah sighed. “Like when life hits you with three bills, two breakdowns, and a call from your mama saying she’s disappointed in your haircut.”

They laughed, but the incline silenced them soon enough. Each step was a push against gravity, sweat dripping like regret on a hot July afternoon.

“That’s the thing,” Elijah finally said, catching his breath. “This race, this walk—don’t it remind you of what Paul wrote? ‘I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.’”

Barbara nodded. “And you know what else he said? That there’s a crown waiting. Not just for him, but for all of us who love His appearing.”

Jeremiah looked out across the woods, brow furrowed. “Sometimes I stumble though. Like when my coworker lied and I let bitterness set up camp in my chest for a whole week. Or when I prayed just to check it off the list, not because I wanted to talk to God.”

They fell quiet a moment, the sound of their feet crunching over roots the only rhythm between them.

Then Jeremiah slapped his own forehead. “And then I stub my toe on a rock—literally—and I remember, oh yeah, life’s a race and an obstacle course!”

Laughter returned like old friends, and even the stranger behind them gave a snort that sounded suspiciously like a chuckle.

THE LAST STRETCH

The final stretch flattened out, trail widening into a field with white tents and cheerful volunteers clapping at the finish line.

Jeremiah found a second wind, mostly fueled by the promise of lemonade. Elijah rolled his eyes but jogged beside him, while Barbara raised her hands and shouted like a woman crossing into glory, “I have endured!”

They slowed, hearts pounding, lungs straining. And right as they hit the finish line, the stranger caught up.

He didn’t speak right away. Just nodded once, wiped his face with a handkerchief, then looked at the three of them.

“That was… some conversation y’all had,” he said, voice gravelly but sure.

Barbara tilted her head. “We weren’t too loud, were we?”

He waved her off. “No, no. You were just… real. Reminded me of some things I’d put down a while ago.”

Elijah gave a kind smile. “The race ain’t over. You can still pick it back up.”

The man looked past them to the path behind. “Maybe. Maybe I will. But today—I was about to quit halfway through that trail. Legs hurt. Heart worse. But listening to y’all made me laugh. Made me think. And it got me to the end.”

He tipped his cap. “So, thank you.”

And just like that, he walked off toward the lemonade stand, a little straighter in his step.

AFTER THE FINISH LINE

The three stood for a moment in the sunshine, warm wind brushing over their backs. The crowd bustled and laughed, kids darting between legs, gospel music wafting from a nearby speaker.

Jeremiah clapped his hands. “Well. I think we all just earned an extra slice of peach cobbler in heaven.”

Barbara smirked. “Only if you share.”

Elijah, eyes on the trail, nodded. “The race of life ain’t easy. But it’s worth it. Especially when you don’t run it alone.”

Postscript:

Some walks change more than your step count. Some hills teach more than sermons. And sometimes, laughter shared under tree shade can push a weary soul a little closer to glory. Keep running. Keep talking. You never know who’s walking close behind, listening

Yes, Diet Coke is my vice. I love Diet Coke and I did change one thing about it in that three years ago I was diagnosed with intermittent tachycardia. I realize that back then or rather up until then I pretty much mainline caffeine.  So I gave it up cold turkey. I have caffeine free DC, caffeine free coffee at my last cardiologist appointment my cardiologist was so amazed that I actually gave up caffeine and have stayed true to it for the last three years but he told me I could drink one thing of caffeine a day if I needed too. I almost felt like I was the biggest cheater ever but yesterday I had my 1st cup of real coffee. YUMMY CITY! 
However, none of these things have caused me to have MS. Has anyone ever been told this?  I've even been sent emails these long-winded emails about what Diet Coke does to you and all the diseases that causes I'm sorry but I just don't believe it.  I'm an RN 
( before I medically retired) and if Diet Coke caused all these medical issues and every single person I worked with in the emergency room would have a laundry list of illnesses

I'd be really sad to see these longtime businesses go, I get all my coffee from Castro Coffee, and they've been there for a combined 70 years. The nail salon is legally designated as a legacy business, and the coffee shop isn't eligible because they've changed their name, but there's a petition going around (linked in below articles) and you can email Mandelman about it. I just got a reply from Mandelman's office. I'll admit there are likely details about the lease and Another Planet Entertainment planning on taking the space that I don't know, but I'm posting partly because I wasn't expecting a reply from my supervisor and partly to let people know if you live in the area and also frequent these businesses! If anything I feel like if a business is designated as a legacy business, that should come with some protections.

I have tried also different coffee beans but nothing seems to work. I fixed it temporarily by setting the internal purr setting to ""2"" but that didn't last long and now sometimes the grinder get jammed or stuck and I am guessing because it is too fine.

Since we were going to see friends and then a family dinner, I decided to talk about it since I couldn’t pretend that things were just normal between us. 

In the middle of the argument, I guess I didn’t feel heard and idk how and why it triggered a massive panic attack (I did get my period today so I guess it didn’t help). I cried hysterically and my husband was gonna drop me off to where we were meeting our friends and uber back home. He got off the car and I kept on having a massive panic attack. We’ve been married for less than a year and he had never seen me have one. They’re so rare for me. He came back inside the car and was visibly very upset asking me why am I overreacting and causing a scene as if someone died. 

For context, in his previous relationship there was lots of emotional manipulation so he thought that I was giving this disproportionate response to emotionally manipulate him and win the argument. Obviously, his lack of empathy really hurt me. 

I’m not sure what to do from this point onwards. He’s not a bad husband at all, I usually call myself a lucky girl since he really takes care of a lot of things, cooking, making my coffee every morning, making sure my water bottle is filled up. So, the lack of empathy/understanding towards my panic attack is hitting me even harder. 

What to do now? :(

While anonymity might raise eyebrows, it’s not unusual in crypto. What matters more is how the platform performs, and so far, **user feedback and overall functionality suggest a legit team is behind it**. Still, I’d love to see more transparency going forward.

My parents were tourguides, and i make simple walking videos in Taipei. 

Today I want to share Minsheng community (民生社區). Developed in 1970s, It is a unique neighborhood in Taipei. This area has low rise buildings due to its closeness to Taipei Songshan Airport. You will notice it has a lot of trees and parks. And the sidewalks for pedestrians are very spacious, HAHA!


There are several cool coffee shops and nice stores(A LOT furniture store is very cool but expensive haha). You will also notice a lot of english cram schools, since the area is quite rich and the education demand is there. The only negative i can think is If you lived here, finding a parking space will be quite diffiult.

Anyway, Highly reccomended for travellers with a bit of time to kill before they catch a flight at the Taipei Songshan Airport (TSA). Check out Fujin street for most of the good stuff. Or if you live in Taipei, it is a good place to come meet some friends and have a walk.

You can learn more about the location here: https://www.travel.taipei/en/attraction/details/2161

1klcin4,https://i.redd.it/xjvcmmly1h0f1.jpeg,Wondering what rug to put here?,"Hey folks,

I’m furnishing a 3.8m x 4.1m living room that’s leaning toward a modern Scandinavian aesthetic, light neutral sofa, timber floors, minimalistic feel with earthy accent cushions. I’m looking to add a rug to ground the space, but I’m not sure what size would work best.

The rug size options available to me are:

* 230x160cm
* 280x190cm
* 320x230cm
* 400x300cm

I’d love some input on which one would suit the room best, ideally something that works under a 3-seater sofa and coffee table without overwhelming the space. Should I go with the 320x230 or 400x300, or would one of the smaller ones still look okay?

I'm also looking to get a 2 seater couch to run perpendicular to the 3 seater, once i've saved a little more :)

Any advice or examples would be much appreciated!",1,1747108300.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

1klch1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintMeghanMarkle/comments/1klch1a/the_harkles_elder_abuse_of_king_charles_iii_their/,The Harkle's elder abuse of King Charles III. Their ongoing and predatory pattern of abusing elders when they are at their most vulnerable,"*Note: This post is quite long, as it contains numerous examples of the Harkle's ongoing elder abuse, as well as a textbook definition of elder abuse. I hope you have a cup of tea, coffee, other beverage with this and enjoy!* :-) xx

One of most disgraceful things about Harold's recent whine-fest about security, and their ongoing attention seeking and 'reveals' of their children, is the fact that much of it is targeted towards smearing and harassing King Charles, who is currently battling cancer. Instead of acting with empathy and concern, the Harkles have seemed to double down on their demands, elder abuse and emotional blackmail, in a predatory manner, when King Charles III is at his most vulnerable.

At 76, he has recently been hospitalized as part of his cancer treatment, and to date, has endured months of treatment, since being diagnosed in January/February 2024, and his treatment continues to this date.

When King Charles visited the late Pope Francis, he looked alarmingly pale, even paler than the late Pope, who passed away just 11 days later. 

[King Charles meeting the late Pope Francis](https://preview.redd.it/nif3e1vjyg0f1.jpg?width=706&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46df7b85dca667541638221756f1ac307b306d1d)

I found it hard to stomach Harold's recent whiny interview about how he wasn't being given millions of pounds worth of (unnecessary) security, paid for by hardworking UK taxpayers from a fund that could go to public transport, libraries, hospitals, schools, homeless shelters etc.

 King Charles has also spoken longingly about wishing to see his grandchildren, Archie and Lili more, while the Harkles deliberately keep away from him. I personally believe that the flurry of instagram posts of their children are also attempts to further 'stick the boot' into King Charles, due to his refusal to influence the outcome of the security case. I personally think it likely he has also refused other financial demands from the Harkles. I personally would not be surprised that they demand a greater share of inheritance should King Charles pass away, which may be why they are now stepping up their abusive tactics.

The Harkles - like the narcissists they are, are keenly aware of what would happen once King Charles passes away. In my opinion they are concerned about the change of status of Prince William and Princess Catherine (who of course will become the new King and Queen). In my opinion they want to get as much as possible - financially and in terms of status - out of King Charles as long as he is alive. Being told 'no' means that they act out in abusive ways, becoming verbally abusive, smearing him publicly, and further emotionally abusing him by withholding access to his grandchildren. Harold has allegedly repeatedly used the line that King Charles will 'never see his grandchildren again' as an abusive threat, when evicted from Frogmore cottage, and also recently, that Harold has again threatened the King with never seeing his grandchildren again, [unless the King steps in and gives Harold the full time security that he wants](https://archive.ph/YhhLu).

**The Harkles long history of elder abuse**

The Harkles also repeatedly refused to visit both the late Queen before her death, and King Charles - denying them access to their grandchildren, as well as TW's father, Thomas Markle, who has made [repeated pleas to his daughter to speak with him](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12530379/Meghan-Markles-father-Thomas-Markle-wants-reconciliation.html), and to meet his grandchildren, before he dies. TW has been accused of [neglecting her own grandmother](https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/samantha-markle-fumes-meghans-grandma-28758883) in her later years, as well as her neglecting the medical needs and care for [own elderly father](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/meghan-markle-accused-elder-abuse-27068541), who has suffered multiple strokes. As well as [ghosting her father](https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/royals/meghan-markles-elderly-uncle-lashes-out-in-bizarre-scathing-interview-about-his-niece/news-story/dfdbb7e0833be8cebe052cbae9a1fee0), she does not contribute at all to his care, which is done by her brother and sister.

The Harkles also attempted to [live in the late Queen's home (Windsor Castle)](https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/royals/prince-harry-and-meghan-reportedly-wanted-to-live-at-windsor-castle/news-story/4ffee3bf1769e1053726f26407991814#:~:text=It%20seems%20Prince%20Harry%20and,hopes%2C%20according%20to%20The%20Times), as well as making constant demands for more money from King Charles, and stressing his very elderly grandmother by asking her to intervene. He allegedly became verbally abusive , with [Harold shouting and swearing at King Charles on the phone](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/prince-harry-swore-charles-explosive-29675287), and publicly criticizing him in the 'Oprah' interview when he refused to give them any more money. King Charles has spent millions on the Harkles, especially their extravagant wedding, Charles also gave / or lent(?) the Harkles [millions of pounds](https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-51047186) to support their transition after leaving the BRF, only to be verbally abused for not giving them even more money, despite not working. TW also wore an extremely [extravagant wardrobe](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/meghan-markle-spends-five-times-more-money-on-clothes-than-kate/CPR75H4CV7LFTY6ESJ4SP34YLE/) during her (brief) tenure working for the BRF, despite her relatively low position the wife of a spare - out of a budget/paid for by King Charles, and Harold also mocked the King for spending millions on their wedding.

Harold also (as a child) physically allegedly attacked King Charles. In 'Spare' he also [recounts day dreaming](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/a42475802/prince-harry-sent-fighter-jet-target-king-charles/) about killing his father in a bombing attack (after his father visited him).

*""As Prince Charles left after visiting his younger son, Harry called a nearby Typhoon fighter jet and told the pilot: “New target. Gray Audi. Headed southeast from my position down track. Towards a big silver barn oriented east-west. The Typhoon tracked Pa, did a low pass straight over him, almost shattering the windows of his Audi. But ultimately spared him. On my orders. It went on to blow a silver barn to smithereens.”*

Harold also publicly and viciously criticized his step - mother and called her names, describing her as a ['villain' in his book 'Spare'](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11977047/Queen-Camilla-hurt-Prince-Harrys-blistering-attack-Spare-branded-villain.html). These deeply misogynistic and ageist comments that reportedly left Queen Camilla feeling extremely hurt.

**Bullying their elders when they are at their most vulnerable, and dying**

The [infamous 'Oprah' interview](https://twitter.com/Freedom16356531/status/1669398820302536723/photo/1)\- which criticized the BRF - was done when 99 year old, Prince Phillip was on his deathbed and gravely ill. Other members of the family asked the Harkles to wait, out of concern for the late Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip, but TW refused.

TW also infamously [mocked the late Queen](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11521093/Harry-makes-poker-face-Meghan-mocking-Queen-says-dody-language-expert-Judi-James.html) with an exaggerated bow and sneering fake smile - only three months after the late Queen's passing.

In the 'Cut' interview - many interpreted some of TW's comments as [thinly veiled threats](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/meghan-markle-made-thinly-veiled-30875038) to the late Queen, just days before the late Queen's passing.

In my opinion, Harold's recent disgraceful interview, demanding millions of pounds worth of security, and smearing his father, at a time when he is extremely vulnerable, and their vicious ongoing elder abuse, smear campaign and emotional blackmail of his elders.

**Signs and symptoms of elder abuse that the Harkles have shown (in my opinion)**

Some of the established symptoms of elder abuse, and elder financial abuse are the following:

**Psychological abuse**

Psychological abuse ... emotional distress for those being targeted.  This can include **bullying, controlling, manipulating threats** like: “**You won’t see your grandchildren again if you don’t…!** It is behavior that **causes mental anguish, stress or fear**.  For example:

* **ridicule** or **threats**
* **harassment or humiliation**
* **withholding affection, and using/withholding access grandchildren as a tactic of control**.

**Verbal abuse**

This can include:

* **humiliating you** in front of others
* **name-calling**
* **shouting** at you
* **repeatedly putting you down**.

**Financial abuse**

Improper use of money, property, or other assets. This could include:

* **Use of home and assets** without contributing to costs - this often includes adult family members insisting on living with elderly relatives (parents or grandparents)
* Failure to repay loans
* **pressurizing and coercing you about finances**.
* Scams that rely on establishing **a relationship with the older person with the intention of exploiting**... **(e.g. demanding to live in Windsor Castle)**

**Neglect**

Not providing for physical, **emotional, or social needs.** This could include:

* **Lack of social contact or support**
* **wilfully ignoring** your **medical or physical care need**s

**Physical abuse**

Physical harm or threats:

* **Any form of physical harm**

**Another is...**

* **lack of respect for a person’s culture or customs (e.g. mocking the curtsey to the late Queen).**

Airline flight was interesting though.,"I've had an Alphahound AB+G for about 2 weeks now and I've tried to find everyday materials in my life significantly above background with little to no luck. Background around here seems to fluctuate around 0.03uSv/h. The highest spot on the granite countertop in my kitchen is about 0.10, give or take. The ceramic dishes and coffee mugs max out around 0.06. Sidewalks outside, about 0.06. No ionizing smoke detectors here and bathrooms are disappointingly close to background. The most interesting reading I could find was a spot on my toilet @0.08. I'm going to scour eBay for something interesting to measure. Maybe some Uranium glass or fiestaware or something. Test sources seem really interesting to run spectrums on, but are a bit out of the budget it seems...

So I had it on during take off and ascent on a couple flights recently and noticed distinctly that at around 8-10k feet, the Gamma hits and uSv/h trailed off to zero. I saw this on multiple legs, so it definitely wasn't a fluke. Curious why this would be. What I was guessing is that as you get sufficiently far from the ground, there may be enough air molecules below you to block the majority of gamma coming from rocks on land and perhaps you're simultaneously not high enough yet to get bombarded by cosmic gamma. By the time we leveled off at 40k feet, it was well above 0.5uSv/h, so definitely getting hit with cosmic rays at that point (over 10x the background where I live). What I think is odd though is that Denver (@5k ft elevation) is often cited as well above sea level in terms of background due to its altitude. This seems to go against my observations in the air at 8-10k ft though, which suggests that cosmic radiation hasn't really picked up at that altitude.

I blackrided from Rosenheim (Bayern) to Salzburg (Austria) and started my epic Balkan trip.
I didn't know how'd I manage to survive, i didn't know if I'll survive at all xd but i just started and it was my best decision ( at least for now)


IF YOU'RE INTERESTED ONLY IN FINDING A TRAVEL BUDDY GO TO THE LAST PART


First day was Salzburg - Zagreb(Croatia).
A guy got me to a gas station. There were 2 poles on their university hitchhiking challenge.
I made it to Villach with next car.
After that:
Exhausting wait on some unlucky hitchhiking spot for fkng 4 hrs, A few short rides across Slovenia,but finally made it, yes, I'm in Zagreb.
My first couchsurfing experience was great. Very welcoming and nice Croatian guy. We talked a lot, drunk a beer and just chilled,next day i was exploring the City,the zoo(4€) was definitely worth it! I had a great time and next morning started to hitchhike to Belgrade. I was told that they love russia and I'll encounter some problems as Ukrainian,but it turned out to be untrue ,just a few kms before the border i met first legendd of the trip! Slovakian and Serbian guys,they got me a coffee, a hotdog and a meat pie (i didn't ask for anything but they insisted xd) 
I made it to Belgrade,It was great,some Indian guy hosted me, we got stoned and ate a Chicken curry xd,the most Indian experience i could have, and next morning i made it to the border with no problems,and there's where the problems started...
I had some problems because of the mistake of Italian Police (I'll explain it in the comments of you'll be interested)
They didn't let me in...
I'm stuck, I'm nerved idk what to do,spent all the time in some Turkish caffe near the border (they gave me a free tea for a few times xdd, and some drunk Serbians gave me a lot of cigs and bought a burger, you're the legends guys!!)
I hitchhiked back to Belgrade in the morning, didn't know what to do, asked the same indian guy if i can stay for 1 more night and he allowed (thanks Ashok!)
Went to the embassy but it was obviously closed(it was a Saturday)
so had to wait till Monday,went to the Italian and to the Ukrainian embassy in Monday,but got no luck, in Ukrainian they offered me only to make a document to get back to Ukraine,and in Italian they said ""ok we'll send a email to Schengen Department,but we don't know how much you gonna wait for an answer xdd""

I Hitchhiked closer to the border and decided to wait for a few days, found a host in city  NIŠ and waited..

One day,a second one,a third... nothing 

It started to annoy me and i decided to just try again but be more prepared 

Got all my documents printed, translated the explanation of my situation to Bulgarian and just inhaled deep...
Made it to Bulgarian border with some Bosnian truck driver,he gave me a chicken sausage and a bread haha, on the border i was red because of the nerves, the border guard looked at me and i already knew what he gonna ask


I explained everything to him,so he just went to his colleagues, came back,gave me a stamp and smiled :))
I was fuckin happy!!
The last ride was funny,serbian guy talked all the way about how he took caine and how he doesn't like Turkey xd
Now I'm in Sofia,in some Couchsurfing host's house again, full of emotions,but don't have anyone to share them with!

So if anyone wants to share this trip to me just hmu! I gonna hitchhike to wherever you are haha
Just be funny,silly, sure and adventurous!

Sorry, English isn't my first language as you understand,but I hope it was a clear story!

Enjoy your life, get your dreams come true and if you wanna something but don't have any idea how to do it - JUST DO!

I guess I'm trying to figure out or balance the idea of my traditional upbringing and well the idea of other stuff as well and I feel like an older Man would be able to help me out and would be the right fit. My faith is important to me but you can be from any background!

I guess for a long time now I've felt like that I've only been attracted to older Men and I'm not sure exaclty why and I've been sort of wrestling with it but yeah I think it's what I really need. I was raised in the church and it's still important to me and yeah I hope that's okay and we can work around stuff! I was raised with discipline

I have never really been able to be attracted to guys my age and if I crushed on someone it was always someone older and Iguess maybe being homeschooled had to do with it but I feel like maybe I guess now more than ever now that I'm in college that I can take a step and figure out what the right thing for me is. I have hangups and stuff but I want to learn and learn about an older Daddy too and what he would want from me.

For me, I realized how disgusting lunch meats are so I stopped eating them. Later on, I noticed that whenever I ate beef outside it was pretty bad from all the weird chewy texture. The only meat that was ""enjoyable"" we're expensive steaks and I didn't splurge anyway. Fish is whatever but I never cook it because the whole house smells. 

Then I asked myself what's the point and became a vegetarian. Then I realized I may aswell be vegan. 

I already hated eggs so that worked out well. The only issue I had was milk since I can't drink coffee without it. But guess what, most coffee's are already unethically sourced so instead of trying to get used to oatmilk in my coffee, I also quit coffee.

I know this post makes it seem like I hate everything but I love vegetables (especially grilled). I'm blessed that I enjoy green beans, broccoli, oats etc.

Anyway I was just wondering if anyone else became vegan this way and what that experience was like if its you

CLARIFICATION: I already didn't consume animal products such as leather, wool etc etc. I am just trying to ask if anyone had a similar experience in becoming vegan. ",29,1747107674.0,vegan,21,0.84,False

Finally graduated this past week (yay). 

My relationship to my parents is... weird. They love me and have let me live at home over and over again. But I don't think they like me very much. Or at least they don't like the reality of me I guess. There's no physical abuse, don't worry. But I think they've broken something fundamental inside me when it comes to like emotional wellness.

I thought I would've gotten better at living with my parents with time, but honestly I've just gotten worse at it. I feel like the rules of the game have changed, so now it's impossible for me to exist correctly. I'm not allowed to Make Statements or express opinions that my mom feels judged by. I'm not allowed to express negative emotions (tired / stressed / sad / annoyed / ill). So lately my strategy has just been to agree immediately to anything my mom wants me to do and bite my tongue against expressing any kind of opinion or Statement or judgement (the trick is, that includes observations of fact because my mom will always ascribe judgement to whatever she wants). But then my parents got annoyed with me about acting like that. Like, I left the room for a second without announcing why and my mom was like ""where are you going?"" so I came back immediately. Then later I asked if I could use the bathroom and they both yelled at me for asking like I was trying to guilt trip them. So at that point I'm like ""okay yeah there's no more correct existence now."" Yesterday my mom opened my door and the kitten ran in and I was keeping the kitten out of my room because my room was really messy. I made a little sigh as I bent down to pick up the kitten and my mom was immediately like ""DON'T GET TICKED OFF AT ME, OKAY? I'M NOT THE ONE WHO PACKED ALL THIS SHIT IN HERE."" and I just looked at her because what could I say?? It never works when I say what I'm actually feeling because she decides for me what I'm feeling and then also decides that whatever I'm feeling (that she says I'm feeling) is also an attack on her. I can never just be... tired. That's never an acceptable answer.

They want me to be Normal all the time. And like yeah I want that too. But as soon as I'm ever a little bit off of normal, like a little more tired than usual (like from you know... just finishing school)  then my mom is like ""you look serious. you look tired. is everything okay. why are you acting off. what are you thinking about. why aren't you laughing at the tv show"" (she actually paused the tv show today to ask me why i wasn't laughing. and one time she asked me at a theater performance why i wasn't clapping). And on the surface that just looks like she cares, and I'm sure she does. But it's all warped because any negative emotion I have somehow gets interpreted as a judgment against her. So as soon as my parents comment on me not being Normal in their eyes I get really scared and start shutting down because I don't want her to get mad at me.

I fall into such deep instant despair as soon as I think they're mad at me. I've even tried to tell them that everything I do, every action I take revolves around trying to get them to not be mad at me. I try so hard not to make Statements or observations or have preferences or opinions or even asking for things I need help with because I never know what could be interpreted as me judging my mom.

All I have left to do is just get a fucking job and an apartment then I'm out of here. But I don't have a job lined up and there's about to be a recession, it fucking sucks. On one hand I'm know if I focus hard on job applications and freelancing then I might be able to get some type of job lined up or at least some money coming in. But how can I focus on job applications and shit when my average day look like:

* mom randomly wakes me up hours earlier than i usually wake, so im jolted with fear that i have to focus hard on being normal and pleasant because if I'm tired then she could get mad at me
* fix myself breakfast and coffee and my dad walks in ropes me into conversation and if I don't act normal enough then that sours the day because I resent the entire situation
* me hiding in my room all day avoiding getting lunch so I don't have to interact with my dad who is blasting the tv in the living room
* me being unable to focus on doing anything bc the tv is blasting
* getting filled with dread leading up to my mom coming home from work
* mom getting home and then snapping at my dad so now i'm extra dreading leaving my room
* me spending with the minimum amount of time possible with my parents so that they are satisfied that i'm Okay and Normal 
* me inevitably fucking up some part of the social interaction and getting hounded about it (""you look serious"" me: ""sorry"" mom: ""you're not in trouble!!!"" me: *increasingly convinced I'm in trouble*)
* and ending with my latest strategy: giving up and pretending to go to sleep until they do

Big sigh.

Okay now that I've vented I'm going to try to put together some type of action plan for me to focus on each day. Like maybe I can spend a set day of the week with a friend or at the library or something just so I'm in a different environment. But the few hours I see my parents in the evenings each day stresses me the fuck out. It might honestly take me finding a way to get out of the house around dinner time hours so that I avoid my mom or something.

And I do love them and they love me, but something's really falling apart here and I don't see how I can Talk Honestly with my them through this problem when every heart to heart conversation we have ends with the consensus that i need to stop talking about what I think. There's no path to emotional validation when everyone's agreed to emotionally invalidate me at every turn, right. Hell even I emotionally invalidate myself. I'm half convinced that yeah, me experiencing negative emotions is the problem after all, better lean harder into only ever being happy and pleasant and unopinionated.",1,1747107478.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False
1klc82y,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1klc82y/rant_the_job_market_is_only_beneficial_for_rich/,Rant: The Job Market is only beneficial for rich people.,"Hi Guys,

I’m a Finance student, and I used to think that if you had the right degree, experience, and skills, you’d land the job. But that’s not the reality, it’s all about prestige and connections.

It pissed me off, that high finance and consulting jobs are practically handed to people from wealthy backgrounds. Every time I go on LinkedIn, do coffee chat, attend networking event, I notice the same pattern: the majority of people in these spaces went to elite “target” schools with strong reputations.

Some job postings are even restricted to those specific schools, and they won’t even bother looking at anyone else's resume. It’s frustrating.

All these rich fckers went to private k-12 schools, which act as feeders into top Ivy League universities. Then, those same top firms hire straight from those schools. It feels like a closed loop, the system is designed to keep the same people at the top.

What doesn’t make sense is why regular, hardworking students from regular schools aren’t given the same opportunities. It’s like the system is built to benefit the wealthy, again and again. They don't want to give resources and opportunities to others who work hard and deserve it.

MY parents were tourguides, and i make simple walking videos in Taipei. Today I want to share Minsheng community (民生社區). This area has low rise buildings, and a lot of trees. There are several cool coffee shops and nice stores(A LOT furniture store is very cool but expensive haha). 

Anyway, Highly reccomended for travellers with a bit of time to kill before they catch a flight at the Taipei Songshan Airport (TSA). Check out Fujin street for most of the good stuff.

Let me know if you want to read it, I’d love to share!","As the elevator plummeted from the top floor, a violent drop that seemed endless yet painfully brief.

I felt the sharp pain and blood seeping through my clothes. My mind screamed at the horror of it all, because my baby, the tiny life inside me, slipped away.

As soon as the paramedics arrived, they wrapped me in blood-streaked bandages, lifting my broken body onto a stretcher.

There, I saw a glimpse of my boyfriend, Nicholas Richmond, who came back from the meeting with his secretary, Courtney Miller.

His arm protectively curled around Courtney, then he shielded her eyes with a gentle touch, whispering, “Do not look. It is too awful.”

Without another glance, they stepped through the doors and into the building, leaving me behind.

The realization was like a second fall. It seemed that five years was nothing for him, because I was never that important to Nicholas, while Courtney’s sweet smile would always occupy his every thought.

That time, I made a decision I had hesitated before, a job offer from a rival company that had been on the table for weeks.

I called them. “I am ready to accept your offe!”

——

After two long days in the hospital, I was finally discharged.

Yet, despite my release, there was no relief. The ache in my heart was far deeper than the physical wounds.

I was leaving the hospital alone, no longer carrying the life I had just discovered was growing inside me.

The morning of the accident had been surreal. A positive test, a flutter of hope, then a nightmare unfolding before I had even grasped the reality.

While packing my few belongings, I whispered to myself, “I do not even know how far along I was.”

The thought cut through me like a knife. The baby in my belly had been too small and too fragile after all.

Suddenly, the door to my room creaked open, pulling me from my thoughts.

For a brief, foolish moment, I hoped it was Nicholas. But it was not. A driver stood there instead.

“Miss McLain, Mr. Richmond had a sudden meeting. He sent me to pick you up,” the driver explained, his voice polite and detached. “Let me carry your things.”

I exhaled slowly, feeling the familiar sting of disappointment.

Nicholas always had an excuse, something pressing, something more important. But when Courtney needed anything, he was never too busy.

Two days in the hospital, and not once did he show his face. He had not called, had not come. Nothing.

“No need. I have got it,” I replied, forcing a smile as I slung my bag over my shoulder and walked out.

The ride home was quiet. The city lights flickered past in a blur, but I could not focus on anything outside the window.

Inside, it felt darker than the night itself. By the time we pulled up to the house, I was numb.

“We are here, Miss,” the driver said, gently bringing me back to the present.

I reached for my handbag, preparing to step out when something caught my eye. Tucked between the seat cushions was a delicate piece of blue dress, which was not mine.

My stomach twisted. I discreetly grabbed it, slipping it into my bag before the driver opened my door.

Once in my room, I tossed the blue dress onto my dresser, trying to ignore the painful questions racing through my mind. Who did it belong to? And why was it there?

The shower indeed washed away the grime of the hospital, but it did nothing to cleanse the doubt that simmered within me.

However, I brushed it off and climbed into bed, hoping for sleep.

When morning came, I woke to the familiar yet unsettling sight of Nicholas lying beside me.

It had become a routine: him slipping into bed unnoticed after I had already fallen asleep, as if our lives had become nothing more than parallel lines.

We were close, but never touching anymore.

His eyes fluttered open under my gaze. “You are awake?” he asked, his voice groggy with sleep.

I did not respond. Instead, I swung my legs over the side of the bed and sat in silence.

“If you are still feeling unwell, you do not need to go into work,” he added, sitting up.

“There is too much piling up. I cannot afford to take more time off,” I replied.

My words were flat, emotionless, but inside, a plan was taking shape. I needed to finish what was left at the office, so I could hand in my resignation and leave that life behind.

Nicholas nodded, oblivious to the distance between us. “Well, after all your injuries are just superficial. You will heal quickly,” he said, slipping into the bathroom, phone in hand, as was his routine.

I watched the door close behind him in disappointment.

He used to take showers fast, but it changed lately. With his phone always in tow, the duration stretched.

However, I could not bring myself to care anymore. I made my way to a different bathroom, determined to avoid him for as long as possible.

When I finished dressing, Nicholas was already sitting on the sofa, a newspaper in hand. He glanced up at me, sarcasm lacing his words. “Skipping our morning coffee ritual? You must be in quite the rush.”

I ignored his attempt at humor, my voice devoid of any warmth. “It slipped my mind.”

A sigh escaped him as he set the paper down. “Fine. Let’s get to the office early then.”

We had always gone to the office together, ever since deciding to move in three years ago.

Back then, everything felt aligned. We had the same goals, the same routines. But lately, I had begun to feel a shift, a subtle but unmistakable discomfort creeping in.

Nicholas seemed more attached to his phone than to me. Even when I grew distant, hoping he would notice, he carried on as though nothing had changed, like my silence meant nothing.

That morning, I sat quietly in the car as Nicholas, focused on his phone, suddenly spoke up. ""I need coffee. Let’s stop by the takeaway to get breakfast,"" he said to the driver, not sparing me a glance.

“Yes, sir,” the driver replied, the words punctuated by the quiet tap of Nicholas's fingers on his screen.

From the corner of my eye, I could see him chatting with Courtney, his secretary.

Nicholas: I left early because Frey had a lot to catch up on after taking yesterday off. Do not rush though, take your time this morning.

Courtney: I understand, her team has been busy lately, so she must feel guilty about it. You also should take it easy, Nick. Your schedule is light today, just some proposals to review and a meeting later.

I’m now up to 2000mg per day. The swelling of my optic nerve has almost completely gone away, but I’m still getting headaches. 

Recently, I noticed that I get the worst headaches on days I have coffee. I originally thought it was because I didn’t drink enough water on days I had coffee. So I tried to counter that today. I had a gatorade and about 2 liters of water throughout the day. Yet, I still got a headache. 

I’ll admit, it is hot where I live (It’s been 100F recently and it gets up to 120 in the summer), so I’m unsure if it’s heat related or coffee related. I rarely drink coffee. But I already feel like I can’t have the drinks I enjoyed since I cant stand carbonated things now. I just wanted to be able to have one more thing I could drink, but I’m wondering if I should give it up and stick to water and electrolyte drinks only.

Antsy

Running out of air to breath

Can’t seem to find the peace

Dividing up my sanity 

Choking at my reality 

Fighting the urge to flee 

Internal parts beg and plea


Take me to the Dead Sea 

And the groves of Olive trees

I’ll run around Jerusalems back allies 

And shout “Palestine will be free” 

How else can I live with me? 

And celebrate with glee 

And ignore the genocide of the century 

And dance on a cemetery 

And toast with the blood we carry 

And ignore what’s too scary 

And what about the atrocities? 

And the gutted Gaza cities
 
And the children amputees
 
And the million refugees 

Who still hold their key

To occupied properties 

On Palestinian Territories
 
Waiting to be free 

Swallow my humanity?

Or cut me from the family tree?

Lost in this binary
 
Drowning in its irony….

But, there’s no turning back for me 

Time to face my destiny 

No matter how heavy 

And step into reality 

And hope I make it out in one piece
 
But there’s never any guarantee

After this who I will be?

I told my husband, I just wanted to feel like a mom, I didn’t know what that meant but it’s how I felt. So he set out to make me smile. He got me an orchid and a bouquet from our late daughters and our fur-doghter. He made me a full breakfast with a new omelette recipe he found on this site. He made me the perfect latte (with guidance as he’s not a coffee drinker) and we ate in bed and he told me about how he pretends sometimes our girls are here, and acts out what he thinks they would be like. We’d have a nearly 3 year old and a 11 month old if they had survived, so navigating breakfast with a toddler and a baby would be stressful. He told me the tattoos he wants to get for them, that he talks to their urns a lot and how grateful he is that I made him a dad. I’ll never get over this man’s love and heart. He never fails to make me smile and feel safe. 

I thought I would hate Mother’s Day like I did after our first loss, but every day he surprises me and shows me the light is there, and maybe our rainbow isn’t so far away. ",3,1747106714.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

There is a stillness that falls after the strike.
As the thunderclap of grief fades,
a silent pall hangs in the charged air.

Time becomes a prison of fading light.
The hours dissolve into nothing.

You sit, trapped in the hold of absence,
a shadow stretched too thin to touch, 
yet too heavy to ignore.

Then—

A ripple.

The familiar creak of their favorite chair, 
startled by an absent touch.
A breath catches.
You swear, for a moment, they are near.

It comes in fragments:

Late nights tangled in blankets
laughing at a show you’d both seen a hundred times.
The quiet way they rested their chin on your shoulder for just a moment.
The rhythmic hush of their breathing beside you in the dark.

Echoes of old songs on late-night drives.
Stray hair gently brushed from your forehead.
Conversations over coffee that felt like forever.

Moments slipping through your fingers
before you realize they’re gone.

What is this?

This sweetness that stings?

It is the cut of love remembered,
the reminder that every heartbeat 
was worth the breaking.

You bleed memory:
the steadfast presence of quiet devotion,
the weight of trust in a lasting embrace,
the light that filled a single, perfect day.

Around you, the room remembers
in the shadows that settle,
in the chill that clings to forgotten corners,
in the quiet that holds 
long after sound is gone.

You speak their name.
No voice answers,
but the silence folds around the memory, whispering

“They were here.
They mattered.
And they are gone.”

Grief is not the enemy;
it is love’s final shape,
twisting itself 
into the fractures left by longing.

It is every cherished moment,
now sharp-edged,
carving you open,
tearing gashes 
defined by the depth of what mattered.

And in that pain, somehow,
you remember how beautiful it all was.

Joy does not arrive like sunlight.
It comes unbidden,
like a breath you forgot you were holding.

It is not happiness—it is presence,
the knowing that parting 
rends space for what remains:
the shape of their handwriting on an old note,
the warmth of their voice in memory,
the gravity of an unspoken understanding.

This is the gift of loss.
Not the easing of pain,
but the way love endures.

In the wind's sigh you’ll feel them,
in the first chill of autumn air,
in the pulse of your own heart—

all softly stirring the memory,
the whisper of a cherished presence,
the truth of what was once held dear.

You do not heal.
You carry.
Every step a reminder
that love is not lost.

Only changed.

Joy can live in sorrow’s shadow,
and in the deep ache of remembrance
you find it—
not in what is gone,
but in all that was given.

```

How can we fix our relationship?,"I'm losing my mind right now. My whole life, everything I had planned for future seems like a sad joke. It's gonna be fucking long one, I've got alot to get off my chest.. About two day ago my wife, Annie asked for some time to talk, we have two little girls (3 and 5) and she arranged a sleepover for them with her sister. This seemed off to me since she is vehemently against sleepovers and has never agreed to one before. She sat me down and admitted to having an emotional affair with a coworker for about half a year which has now become physical. She wasn't crying when she told me but that's not abnormal for her, she is a very sensitive person but has a hard time showing them. She works as a corporate auditor for a large company and is very skilled at networking so I never thought anything of the numerous texts and calls she would get even during her off hours. To say I was stunned was an understatement, I felt sick and disgusted by her continuing to lie to me and the fact that she was so good at hiding it as well.

I asked her how it started and he was a new hire to the job and they were similar in age and both married so she 'felt safe' hanging out with him. Annie is not one to discuss her personal life with anyone who isn't a close friend or family so she said most of their conversations in the beginning would be about the job or shared interests. She said her and Mark (the other guy) became really good friends over their shared love of sports, specifically tennis. Now I knew she would go every Saturday to the local tennis club to play but she never told me it was with Mark, she'd always say it was just some people from work and I wouldn't question it. She wouldn't talk about work a lot with me but I knew the people she was close with and Mark's name never came up even when he first started. I had met him at her office Christmas party but he had said hi to us and kind of stayed away and I assumed they weren't close.

I asked to tell me everything, every lie she had ever said regarding Mark and its a fucking list. A couple of months ago her company arranged a team getaway from other branches and she told me they weren't allowed to bring partners, that was a lie. I asked her if it's because she wanted to spend time with Mark and she just shrugged her shoulders and said I don't know. Her and her work friends go to the pub every Friday after work and I asked about joining them some times and she said it would be awkward since no other significant others come. That was also a lie. Her and Mark went on pseudo double dates with her work friends and she always told them I was too busy if they ever invited me. Alot of her lies involved keeping me from seeing her and Mark interact. She said she didn't even know why she was doing it in the beginning but just wanted to keep us separated. At this point I fucking felt my heart break. It was a physical pain in my chest, this person who I thought was the most beautiful and kind person in the world, who I thought was special enough to be the mother of my children had betrayed me. I didn't be close to her, I didn't want to see her but I knew I need to to get the whole story. I asked her how it became physical and she said last Friday after the pub she had gotten a little tipsy and went to the smoking area with Matt (she had quit but obviously being around this dickhead made her start again). She said they were talking about Matt's marriage and how he had said he wasn't happy and she said she hugged him and he obviously got the wrong idea and kissed her. I asked her if she kissed him back and she said she didn't push him away the way she should've - whatever the fuck  that means. She said she left after that and immediately came home. I do remember how quiet she was last Friday, I assumed it was end of week stress and let her have some time to herself and put the girls to bed myself.

She said she was telling me now because she realised she had started an emotional affair with Matt and knew the only way not to lose me was to come clean. She said she knew what she had done was wrong and that in the beginning she just liked that an attractive man was giving her attention and used it as a confidence booster. I couldn't fucking listen to her about this. I know, especially after our second daughter was born, my job kept me busier than usual. Our plan was to work hard now so we could retire early and she had championed me doing this. I wasn't a perfect husband or father but I tried hard to give them a good life. I wanted to scream and yell at her but that's never been my personality so all I could do was numb myself to all the hurt while I tried to figure out how this could have happened.

The night ended with me sleeping on the sofa, embarrassingly crying myself to sleep. I wanted to ask Annie if she loved Matt but was fucking terrified of her answer. What if she said yes and that she wanted to leave me. How could I not see my girls everyday. How could I tolerate the love of my life being with someone else. I kept thinking of everything I could've done to prevent this.  Annie and I have always been hyper-independent people but maybe she needed more from me. Maybe she was asking for attention in her own way and I never listened. Still it doesn't excuse the sneaking around and lying. I thought we were just going through a temporary rough patch and when I tried to bring up going on date nights or trips to rekindle our relationship she would always shoot it down by making some excuse with the kids. In this last year our sex life has reduced, after our second daughter she had gotten a lot stretch marks and I knew she struggled with her body so I didn't want to push her. 

After a night of barely sleeping I needed more answers from her. Telling me wasn't enough, I didn't clear steps from her on how she was going to fix our relationship. Even if she wanted to fix our relationship. We went out for breakfast and I asked her the question I was dreading all night: if she loved Matt. She immediately said no and that she had just got caught up in receiving attention from the wrong place. She said she couldn't imagine losing our family and that she didn't expect me to forgive her but that she needed to tell me about the kiss. I told her I don't if I could trust her anymore after all the lying and how she had taken my perfect image of her as a wife and mother and thrown it away. She started crying and saying that she would do anything to fix it and if I asked her to quit her job she would. She showed me her phone and that she had deleted and blocked his number and would now only communicate through a monitored company communication app. I know she feels guilty for what she's done but I keep getting caught up on how easily I trusted her when she would walk out the door spewing her lies. How could I trust her again. How do I know the next time we go through something she won't crave that attention again.

I asked her for some space and have moved into the guest room while we figure out what to do next. She keeps talking about couple therapy and how she would absolutely hate herself if her actions caused our daughters to lose their parents. She grew up in a broken home with a barely there dad and doesnt want the same for our children. I told her I would never abandon my kids even if we split up and didn't appreciate the insinuation that I wouldn't. I talked to my older brothers about this and they said I should try for my daughter's sake but also make her quit her job as well. That feels off to me, I know how long she worked there to be promoted into her position and I dont want to take that away from her but at the same time I can't tolerate that POS being around her. I have to keep on stopping myself from pummelling his face in. 

Since we've been sleeping separately she's has been sending me good morning letters that she makes my 5 year old bring to me. It feels nice but the feeling is tainted since I know she only making an effort since she feels guilty. My daughter enjoys being a carrier pigeon and knocks on my door with a 'hoot hoot' so my mornings haven't been that bad. We've been cordial with eachother and focus on making sure our daughter's don't have any disruption. She made a cup of coffee the other day and told me she loved me when she handed it over but I couldn't bring myself to say it back. I havent kissed or touched her in a week and I can't bring myself to do it. I just keep picturing her with him and how many boundaries she let his cross with her. I can't look at her for too long, I'll melt and cave but never trust her and its not fair for either of us.

I'm not sure on what do next? I can't imagine her not being my wife but how can we stay together when I find it hard to be around her right now.

A bit over a week ago I found myself perusing a website, nothing special - mainly technology at a discounted price due to various reasons and imperfections. 
I found a peculiar item that drew my attention - a bone box with ornate trim. I know what you’re thinking; ‘What’s that got to do with technology?’
Really good question, and exactly the question that went through my mind as I looked through the listing photos that were attached.
The box piqued my curiosity, yet I had no idea what it was meant to be. It looked to be composed of two pieces of bone, with what I could only guess was pearl inlaid in a triangular pattern atop one of the halves. No angles gave clue to hinges or anything similar, and I figured that perhaps it was likely something akin to cranial sutures.

I can’t say exactly why, but I just had to have it. I like oddities and the such; and this was a piece that I would really like to add to my collection. 

As I made my way through the webpage I looked for as much information as possible, and I was left wanting in each step of the purchasing process… 
The item in question was only twenty dollars - cheap as, considering how unique its design was. A little off-putting, although only in hindsight. In the moment I found this more exciting than anything.
The seller had no information pertaining to who they were or where the item was located. Even more off-putting - an immediate red flag.
The seller in question had ‘only three remaining’, and at the time I figured that perhaps they had a few of these and each was slightly different in design. 
The final page before purchasing gave me a hearty chuckle, I’m not afraid to admit. It read as follows:

Tomorrow: FREE one-day delivery.
1-7 days: FREE Skinwalker delivery.

Initially I paused, confused, as to what it meant. After a quick search online, my afore mentioned hearty chuckle started - “A creature of Native American legend” was the search result. I laughed audibly for a few minutes I believe. The creature in question is an interesting read, and labelled as exactly that - legend.

I honestly don’t know what I expected when I selected the Skinwalker option: but who would select anything but when making an online purchase? Figuring it was nothing more than a hilarious joke, and that it would more-than-likely just be the exact same shipping option - that was the option I opted for with a cheesy grin and an overly excited click of the mouse.

Tuesday morning, I heard a knock at the door. Enthusiastically I answered the door with a cheery “Hello”, expecting my unique item to have arrived, only to find no one standing there. Looking up and down the street I couldn’t see anyone, just the usual few cars that lined the street and a neighbour’s cat that was staring at me from under one of said cars. 
Wondering if it was a knock and run, I turned back and walked inside. The likely-hood of a knock and run was minimal being a Tuesday morning. I remember thinking, ‘the kids were at school and the other adults were at work’. Having a weird roster has its perks - Tuesday and Wednesday off each week gives a better chance to get to any shops without having to fight time, although it can prove lonely with seemingly everyone else on a different rotation.

Walking back to my arm-chair, I took a seat and continued doom-scrolling inane crap as I tend to do. 

Maybe twenty minutes had passed, and I found myself laughing away to some reel or another. 
My ‘joy’ was interrupted by another rapping on my front door. Sitting my phone on my side table, I made my way to the door laughing most of the way.
I spoke through the door as I opened it, offering a meager apology to the delivery guy,
“ Hello. Sorry, mate, I was-” my apology was stopped midway as again I found an empty porch. This time I gingerly made my way down the few porch steps and examined both sides of my old house, then up and down the street, expecting to find a truant child perhaps, looking for a thrill while everyone else was at school. 

Nothing.

A long moment passed as I internally questioned whether I had actually heard the knocking… trying to consider things through multiple lenses, I came to the conclusion that the street was too still to have misinterpreted other noises as knocking, but had nothing else to fall back on.

I decided that I’d sit on the steps and wait for my mystery knocker to return for round three.

The next hour passed like a meandering turtle. Not a soul walked the street in that time and I found myself getting over the waiting game quite quickly. The only form of anything that could be considered close to entertaining was watching the neighbours cat sitting underneath the car and pondering what it’s life entailed. Even that grew stale quickly as the cat appeared interested in naught but staring at me. Maybe it was sitting there wondering what my life entailed, just as I wondered about its. 
As I stood to make my way inside once more, the only car to make it’s way down the street that I had seen or heard all morning turned into my street and slowly accelerated. I remember turning and paying attention to it, an old cream thing with soft lines. Perhaps vintage - although I wouldn’t know enough to know whether it could have actually been a vintage model or not. 
The warm sun shone down from the heavens and the immaculate car’s surface reflected the every ray of the sun’s light across my neighbours houses like a flashlight shining betwixt the panelling of a picket fence as it passed by. 
The hairs on my neck stood to attention as the car made it’s way past my house - the inexorable reflection danced across the cat and it’s eyes reflected the light back toward me, not the usual sickly yellow of a cat utilising the lowlight for visual advantage, but rather a vibrant red that felt as if it eyes bore into my very being.

The sudden shift gave me a start and I’m not too ashamed to admit I jumped just a little bit... I figure either the car passing or me jumping must have startled the cat as it was gone by the time the car had passed.

Holding my hand to my chest, I started to chuckle again with a bowed head before turning back inside with an embarrassed smile, softly shutting the door behind me.

Some time after lunch as I sat straddled upon the porcelain throne; reading news updates, checking the freshest memes - the usual time-fillers as I performed my daily ritual. I was drawn from my phone, however, by a sudden and sharp scratching from above me. My gaze diverted to the empty patch of ceiling above me immediately as I sat there motionless. 
“Rats?” I softly spoke to myself, puzzled. Although I don’t remember ever hearing the sound previous, that doesn’t exactly equate to no chance there’s a rat or rats now. Even though the sound only lasted a few seconds before stopping and not returning, it left me in a state that I can only describe as uncertain... like a state of anxiety I guess.

As I pulled my draws up, I heard the unmistakable knocking from my front door once more. 
Standing there with my pants halfway up, frozen, I contemplated not even answering the door and instead waiting for the ‘we missed you’ slip and just picking it up myself. 
An ingenious thought crossed my mind, if I do say so myself - exit through the back door and stealthily make my way around front to catch whoever was there. Ingenious.

As quietly as I could, I unlatched the deadbolt and gently opened the back door - no creaks to give my plans away. Poking my head out first, I meticulously scanned my back yard. No one - off to a solid start.
Softly closing the door behind me, each step forward made my pulse quicken. I suppose the unknown has a way of messing with us in ways, hence our fervent search for knowledge at each step of every turn.
Rounding the side of my house, I set sight on my side fence and I could feel my face become deadpan - my stealth mission was immediately hindered by the fence and accompanying gate that squeaked more than a church-mouse choir.

I’m still not entirely sure what made me think this was the best course of action, but I took a running start in an attempt to clear the fence in a graceful straddle. What ensued however, was polar opposite: my hip/guts hit the fence with a sickening thud, and I let out an ‘Oof’ sound with the wind driven from my body, I then tumbled over the fence to the front side with a second ‘Oof’ as the remaining wind was driven from my body upon forced contact with the ground.
“…Fuck…” my words were strained and probably through reflex more so than any practical thoughts. I don’t know how long I was laying there trying to gather myself before I remembered what I was even doing, getting up as quickly as my battered body would allow, I poked my head around the corner like a curious child.
Nothing.
Again, no one was anywhere near the vicinity. Although in hindsight, if someone was there, my full-body ballet would probably have sent the most battle-hardened fleeing in terror… probably not, but it helps my fractured ego a little bit after falling over my own fence and driving the wind from my body twice in a single bound…

With a limp I made my way to the street to see if anyone was around, partially to see if the potential culprit was anywhere to be seen, and partially to see if anyone saw my fence molest me with a suplex out the side of my house.

What did catch my attention however, was a patchwork weaving of sticks and bones that was affixed to my mailbox and lightly swinging in the breeze. I had never seen such a thing before in my life. 
Made from three sticks tied with some type of fibres, perhaps strands of hair, around the corners to form a triangle with three bones and an uncut stone suspended inside the arrangement by the same fibrous bindings.
I would be lying if I said I was anything but petrified in that moment, although I couldn’t have explained why at the time. 
Many minutes must have passed as I stood there staring at the precarious trinket attached to my mailbox. Eventually I mustered the courage to grab it, slowly. 
It was cold to the touch, abnormally cold, even before adding in the beaming sun’s rays to the equation. 
In a panic I ripped the unfathomable trinket from my belongings and tossed it haphazardly into the street with a sneer before quickly moving inside and bolting the door shut and sliding down the door, back pressed firmly, until I sat there pressed up against the barrier to the outside world. Curling my legs up to my chest I remained there, scared. Scared of what? I wouldn’t have been able to articulate the thoughts, even if given more than ample opportunity. All I knew was either something was really wrong, or someone was playing a prank on me worthy of a world record title.

Not a minute had passed when I was jerked from my racing thoughts by a loud knock imminently behind me. Moving to my feet with such a speed I wouldn’t have been surprised if I had torn myself from my skin and left it in a wet coil where I once sat.
I stood there, motionless, staring at the only obstacle between myself and the knocking.
“Wh- who-” my voice all but faded, I cleared my throat and tried again, “Who’s there? This isn’t funny, man.” Although as steady as I could hold, my voice wavered like slack fishing line in the wind.

Nothing.

I could feel tears welling in my eyes as I closed them, hoping against all that this would just stop. Just go away. 

Again the knocking came, this time louder, more forceful than before, then a soft woman’s voice followed,
“Is that you, Steven?” the voice was off-putting, at first I thought it was one of my neighbours, Mai, but her voice was… different. Like it didn’t have any pitch variation at all, just monotone and flat.
“Mai? Mai is that you?” I called through the door, abject terror parting momentarily.
“Is that you?” her voice still sounded weird, but it sounded like Mai nonetheless,
“Mai!” I exclaimed, unlocking and throwing the door open, “You won’t beli-” I started to speak with returning clarity before stopping dead. 
In the doorway did not stand Mai, but rather a small bone box inlaid with pearl rest on my doormat…
I remember an energy running the entirety of my body in that moment - an energy unlike any I had ever experienced previously. Every piece of me begun to shake and wobble violently - after some thought I’m likely to believe that perhaps my body was flooded with adrenaline or what-have-you and that was my bodies ‘fight or flight’ response kicking in. 
In a sick irony however, I felt utterly unable to do either, and instead stood there like a cow in the headlights. My legs gave way after what was probably closer to seconds but felt like an eternity as I collapsed to the floor, jarring me from the mental coffin I subconsciously found myself imprisoned in. 
Scurrying to my feet and slamming the door closed followed by the bolt and the regular lock in as quicker motion as I could muster, I then braced myself against the door, shoulder first, with my legs locked firmly behind me. 
Every breath came more rapid than the last and it felt as if my chest would burst at any moment as I could feel my hot breathe dispersed by the wooden barricade reflected back against my face.

Scratching from the walls broke my concentration on my front door, the source however, was an enigma - feeling as if the direction rotated with my perception in an attempt to confuse me, I stood motionless staring about the room in rising confusion.

All sense of normality had left my body: anxiety fueled my every thought and uncertainty gave rise to abject terror - something was horribly wrong, every ounce of my being screamed it at me, to run: run like my life depended on it.

Chicken-skin struck as the hairs on my neck stood on end at my sudden realisation: The back door! In my haste to see who was outside my front door, I had forgotten to secure the back door…

Creeping around as if I was walking on proverbial egg-shells, my pulse driving any other sensation from my ears, I rounded my head from the hallway and eyed the back door - both the wooden door and the gauss door swung open with reckless abandon. I still feel as if I could drop dead on the spot whenever I think back to that scene… the barricades to my abode had proven as useful as wrist-bands at an orgy, and I stood motionless for more than I care to remember, awaiting my life to end at any moment.

The sound of metal being ripped asunder spurned me from my motionless gaze, it had sounded as if it came from next door - “Mai!” I exclaimed, control returning to me in an instant. Perhaps Mai and I didn’t know each other very well, but her and Steven were very nice people, and if whatever plagued me on this day had set it’s sights on her: I had to try and help her in some way. I would want help if the shoes were reversed…

Stopping only to slide a butcher’s cleaver from the drawer, I bolted out the front door with startling efficiency - held only momentarily by my attempts at security. Amazingly I had the presence of mind to slide the butcher’s utensil into the side of my trousers before exiting my doorway. If anyone would have seen me sprinting next door wielding a large knife, the cops would have been here in an instant. I kind of wish I had now; at least law enforcement may have been there, and maybe they would have seen what I saw…

Only when I replay the events of that day in my mind do I recall seeing the strange bauble affixed to my letter-box once more, the same hideous bauble I flung away with disdain not twenty minutes prior. At the time I did not hesitate in my strides to take note of such things - although I wish more than anything that I had.

Exclaiming, “Mai!” I pounded on the door with inexorable fury, desperate for an answer and swimming in adrenaline - naught.
Finding it hard to believe that noone would have heard my thunderous knocks I took a step back and charged her front door shoulder-first.
The jam stood firm and I bounced like a pigeon on a windshield - and it fucking hurt. Momentarily I dropped my arm limp, agony aflush throughout my system - a welcome reprieve from an endless onslaught of panic.
Subduing the pain I repositioned myself and laid by boot into the door-lock with all my weight. Again and again I drove myself into the stationary obstacle that defied me. After the fourth or fifth kick the door-jam splintered and the door gave way, echoing the abrupt sound throughout the house.

A wave of cold air hit me harder than a prime-mover hitting a deer on the freeway. 

As if on auto-pilot I immediately flung myself inside without a moment’s thought, stopped only by my bodies sudden reaction to the climatic change. I felt every muscle start to tighten one after another, beginning in my legs, and each breath became enigmatically visible - how could the temperature shift from a warm, spring day outside to such a frigid and incompatible climate?  And seemingly as soon as one stepped over the threshold inside.

Immediately aware of the choices I had made, yet resolved to continue forward for Mai’s sake, I gingerly took my first step since regaining control over my bodily functions.

Initially, Mai’s house looked as I had expected it - bar lights off where one would have thought they would be on if someone was home. I called out to her again,
“Mai! Mai, are you home?! It’s Allan! Mai, are you okay?!”
Nothing… not a shred of sound emanated from within her house.
Determined to find Mai I continued forth warily.

The lounge room: everything was neat and tidy. A good sign to her wellbeing I had thought at the time, but honestly - my house hadn’t been ransacked and I was scared out of my mind. Any attempt at regaining my composure was swiftly met at the guillotine as I eyed a small white box on her coffee table - a box made of bone and inlaid in pearl. Any chance I had at feeling in that moment was dwarfed when the same sound of metal being torn asunder assailed my hearing - my eyes moved underfoot to the vibrating floorboards I stood upon. Whatever that sound was, it was coming from underfoot; from underneath the house.

All hope I had desperately clung to was ripped from me like a pacifier from a newborn as I turned tail only to be met face to face with Mai.

I think I almost shit myself when I turned and found her there, staring blankly at me. I can’t blame her - her neighbour had just broken into her house and as far as she may have been concerned: I was there only for nefarious reasons.

“I’m sorry, Mai, you didn’t answer your door and I was so worried-”

Mai didn’t flinch.

“I’ve had the weirdest fucking day and I was worried about you guys-”

In my embarrassed state I minced over my words in a futile attempt to get Mai to understand me, but she seemingly didn’t care for a word that came from my mouth.

“Mai? Mai, are you listening?”

Mai continued to stare at me, or more, seemed to stare through me. I took a laboured step toward Mai as I raised my hand to gently place on her shoulder, feeling she may have been experiencing similar to what I had, stating softly,
“Mai, where’d you get that box?..”
Her attention shifted as her eyes focused on mine, suddenly aware of my presence,
“I thought you were at work.” Mai spoke, more a combination of words strung together than a coherent sentence,
“Huh?” the question had caught me off-guard, “I don’t work Tuesdays or Wednesdays… Mai? Are you okay?”
“Steven? Is that you?”
Her words made my skin crawl… something about her demeanour was very off to the Mai I infrequently spoke to,
“Mai. We need to go. Now.” I grabbed her wrist as I started back toward her front door, immediately thrown by how cold her skin was, and how loose… the skin about her wrist twisted like it wasn’t actually attached underneath - not unlike that saggy, granny-skin grandmas tend to get under their necks and about their arms.
“What the-” I let go almost immediately and turned back to Mai, “You’re so cold, come, lets get you out of here…”

No sooner than I had uttered the sentence, did I feel a warm, sharp sensation light up my back like a flare in the night. Wincing and stumbling as I turned back to Mai, only then did I notice her eyes in the lowlight of the small room - dull black orbs that absorbed any rays of light shining through the broken doorway that would so much as grace her face. 
“Steven? I thought you were rats?” her voice changed when she spoke the word rats: it sounded wholly different. She sounded like me…

“Mai?-” I choked out as my feet fumbled with every reverse step, “Mai? Are you okay?..” my voice little more than a light rasp.

Her sunken gaze never let me, standing completely still as I inched my way from inside her house.

Only when I had exited her house in full did I turn to run, to be met by law enforcement with firearms drawn and concentrated on me,
“Freeze! Hands up and get on the ground!”
I hadn’t heard a sound other than Mai and my own heartbeat, and their timing leaves me with many questions in hindsight. Honestly in that moment I was glad, I was glad to be met by another human-being on the front lawn. I was even glad to be taken in the back of the Pig-Mobile - at least I wasn’t alone.

Everything from that moment onward seemed rushed, or perhaps passed me by in a flash. Doctors all say the latter due to trauma of some kind; hence my ‘near-instantaneous mental decline’.

I was arrested and charged with Break & Enter, Possession of a Deadly Weapon, Criminal Trespass, Menacing Behaviour and Criminal Mischief… my lawyer argued for insanity, against my wishes, and ultimately that’s what was decided - I was declared Guilty by reason of Insanity.

The Doctor’s won’t listen to a thing I’ve had to say and have declared that I would be a danger to myself if let free and unmedicated. No so much a danger that I’m not allowed a few comforts such as pencils and paper; but allegedly enough of a danger that I can’t see myself outside these walls any time soon.

The skittering noise in the roof started only a few days after my arrival, although noone else admits to hearing it - it’s here. It’s always here…

This morning I could hear soft mumbling from the other side of my cell. Pressing my ear against the soft, padded wall, I focused intently - genuine interactions with someone outside the orderly can prove few and far between. 
I could only make out the last few sentences,
“Allan! Allan, are you home?! It’s Allan! Allan, are you okay?! You’re so cold, come, lets get you out of here…”

I think the title says it all. I (35m) am incredibly shy. I’ve basically online dated since after high school. Dating back when was easier, because I just happenstanced into my first girlfriend and it naturally led to a relationship…she was very forward and I tend to find that attractive in women (go figure). 

Online dating is just not working for me anymore and I have to cold approach women. I get a little nervous in general when initiating conversation, when I’m not the initiator, things tend to flow more smoothly, but this is obviously not going to happen when just going about my daily life. 

I work 9 am to 6pm M-F, with commute and gym, I have very little time to meet people via hobbies/interests. 

So, ladies, how do you want to be approached? It’s difficult to try and inset myself into whatever you’re doing, because it feels like I’m just bother you. But, at this point, idk what else to do.  So imagine you’re grocery shopping, or walking from one shop to the next, sitting and having a coffee for a few minutes in between errands, whatever…how do I approach you in a friendly, inviting way to spark conversation, when there’s nothing really going on for engagement commonality?",10,1747106323.0,dating,17,1.0,False

Here I write my recounts from over the last few weeks in as much clarity as I can muster in my anxious state, in hopes that my words will be found by another. In my desperation I only hope my recollection is accurate and true, and not just some fevered dream…

A bit over a week ago I found myself perusing a website, nothing special - mainly technology at a discounted price due to various reasons and imperfections. 
I found a peculiar item that drew my attention - a bone box with ornate trim. I know what you’re thinking; ‘What’s that got to do with technology?’
Really good question, and exactly the question that went through my mind as I looked through the listing photos that were attached.
The box piqued my curiosity, yet I had no idea what it was meant to be. It looked to be composed of two pieces of bone, with what I could only guess was pearl inlaid in a triangular pattern atop one of the halves. No angles gave clue to hinges or anything similar, and I figured that perhaps it was likely something akin to cranial sutures.

I can’t say exactly why, but I just had to have it. I like oddities and the such; and this was a piece that I would really like to add to my collection. 

As I made my way through the webpage I looked for as much information as possible, and I was left wanting in each step of the purchasing process… 
The item in question was only twenty dollars - cheap as, considering how unique its design was. A little off-putting, although only in hindsight. In the moment I found this more exciting than anything.

The seller in question had ‘only three remaining’, and at the time I figured that perhaps they had a few of these and each was slightly different in design. 
The final page before purchasing gave me a hearty chuckle, I’m not afraid to admit. It read as follows:

Tomorrow: FREE one-day delivery.
1-7 days: FREE Skinwalker delivery.

Initially I paused, confused, as to what it meant. After a quick search online, my afore mentioned hearty chuckle started - “A creature of Native American legend” was the search result. I laughed audibly for a few minutes I believe. The creature in question is an interesting read, and labelled as exactly that - legend.

I honestly don’t know what I expected when I selected the Skinwalker option: but who would select anything but when making an online purchase? Figuring it was nothing more than a hilarious joke, and that it would more-than-likely just be the exact same shipping option - that was the option I opted for with a cheesy grin and an overly excited click of the mouse.

Tuesday morning, I heard a knock at the door. Enthusiastically I answered the door with a cheery “Hello”, expecting my unique item to have arrived, only to find no one standing there. Looking up and down the street I couldn’t see anyone, just the usual few cars that lined the street and a neighbour’s cat that was staring at me from under one of said cars. 
Wondering if it was a knock and run, I turned back and walked inside. The likely-hood of a knock and run was minimal being a Tuesday morning. I remember thinking, ‘the kids were at school and the other adults were at work’. Having a weird roster has its perks - Tuesday and Wednesday off each week gives a better chance to get to any shops without having to fight time, although it can prove lonely with seemingly everyone else on a different rotation.

Walking back to my arm-chair, I took a seat and continued doom-scrolling inane crap as I tend to do. 

Maybe twenty minutes had passed, and I found myself laughing away to some reel or another. 
My ‘joy’ was interrupted by another rapping on my front door. Sitting my phone on my side table, I made my way to the door laughing most of the way.
I spoke through the door as I opened it, offering a meager apology to the delivery guy,
“ Hello. Sorry, mate, I was-” my apology was stopped midway as again I found an empty porch. This time I gingerly made my way down the few porch steps and examined both sides of my old house, then up and down the street, expecting to find a truant child perhaps, looking for a thrill while everyone else was at school. 

Nothing.

A long moment passed as I internally questioned whether I had actually heard the knocking… trying to consider things through multiple lenses, I came to the conclusion that the street was too still to have misinterpreted other noises as knocking, but had nothing else to fall back on.

I decided that I’d sit on the steps and wait for my mystery knocker to return for round three.

The next hour passed like a meandering turtle. Not a soul walked the street in that time and I found myself getting over the waiting game quite quickly. The only form of anything that could be considered close to entertaining was watching the neighbours cat sitting underneath the car and pondering what it’s life entailed. Even that grew stale quickly as the cat appeared interested in naught but staring at me. Maybe it was sitting there wondering what my life entailed, just as I wondered about its. 
As I stood to make my way inside once more, the only car to make it’s way down the street that I had seen or heard all morning turned into my street and slowly accelerated. I remember turning and paying attention to it, an old cream thing with soft lines. Perhaps vintage - although I wouldn’t know enough to know whether it could have actually been a vintage model or not. 
The warm sun shone down from the heavens and the immaculate car’s surface reflected the every ray of the sun’s light across my neighbours houses like a flashlight shining betwixt the panelling of a picket fence as it passed by. 
The hairs on my neck stood to attention as the car made it’s way past my house - the inexorable reflection danced across the cat and it’s eyes reflected the light back toward me, not the usual sickly yellow of a cat utilising the lowlight for visual advantage, but rather a vibrant red that felt as if it eyes bore into my very being.

The sudden shift gave me a start and I’m not too ashamed to admit I jumped just a little bit... I figure either the car passing or me jumping must have startled the cat as it was gone by the time the car had passed.

Holding my hand to my chest, I started to chuckle again with a bowed head before turning back inside with an embarrassed smile, softly shutting the door behind me.

Some time after lunch as I sat straddled upon the porcelain throne; reading news updates, checking the freshest memes - the usual time-fillers as I performed my daily ritual. I was drawn from my phone, however, by a sudden and sharp scratching from above me. My gaze diverted to the empty patch of ceiling above me immediately as I sat there motionless. 
“Rats?” I softly spoke to myself, puzzled. Although I don’t remember ever hearing the sound previous, that doesn’t exactly equate to no chance there’s a rat or rats now. Even though the sound only lasted a few seconds before stopping and not returning, it left me in a state that I can only describe as uncertain... like a state of anxiety I guess.

As I pulled my draws up, I heard the unmistakable knocking from my front door once more. 
Standing there with my pants halfway up, frozen, I contemplated not even answering the door and instead waiting for the ‘we missed you’ slip and just picking it up myself. 
An ingenious thought crossed my mind, if I do say so myself - exit through the back door and stealthily make my way around front to catch whoever was there. Ingenious.

As quietly as I could, I unlatched the deadbolt and gently opened the back door - no creaks to give my plans away. Poking my head out first, I meticulously scanned my back yard. No one - off to a solid start.
Softly closing the door behind me, each step forward made my pulse quicken. I suppose the unknown has a way of messing with us in ways, hence our fervent search for knowledge at each step of every turn.
Rounding the side of my house, I set sight on my side fence and I could feel my face become deadpan - my stealth mission was immediately hindered by the fence and accompanying gate that squeaked more than a church-mouse choir.

I’m still not entirely sure what made me think this was the best course of action, but I took a running start in an attempt to clear the fence in a graceful straddle. What ensued however, was polar opposite: my hip/guts hit the fence with a sickening thud, and I let out an ‘Oof’ sound with the wind driven from my body, I then tumbled over the fence to the front side with a second ‘Oof’ as the remaining wind was driven from my body upon forced contact with the ground.
“…Fuck…” my words were strained and probably through reflex more so than any practical thoughts. I don’t know how long I was laying there trying to gather myself before I remembered what I was even doing, getting up as quickly as my battered body would allow, I poked my head around the corner like a curious child.
Nothing.
Again, no one was anywhere near the vicinity. Although in hindsight, if someone was there, my full-body ballet would probably have sent the most battle-hardened fleeing in terror… probably not, but it helps my fractured ego a little bit after falling over my own fence and driving the wind from my body twice in a single bound…

With a limp I made my way to the street to see if anyone was around, partially to see if the potential culprit was anywhere to be seen, and partially to see if anyone saw my fence molest me with a suplex out the side of my house.

What did catch my attention however, was a patchwork weaving of sticks and bones that was affixed to my mailbox and lightly swinging in the breeze. I had never seen such a thing before in my life. 
Made from three sticks tied with some type of fibres, perhaps strands of hair, around the corners to form a triangle with three bones and an uncut stone suspended inside the arrangement by the same fibrous bindings.
I would be lying if I said I was anything but petrified in that moment, although I couldn’t have explained why at the time. 
Many minutes must have passed as I stood there staring at the precarious trinket attached to my mailbox. Eventually I mustered the courage to grab it, slowly. 
It was cold to the touch, abnormally cold, even before adding in the beaming sun’s rays to the equation. 
In a panic I ripped the unfathomable trinket from my belongings and tossed it haphazardly into the street with a sneer before quickly moving inside and bolting the door shut and sliding down the door, back pressed firmly, until I sat there pressed up against the barrier to the outside world. Curling my legs up to my chest I remained there, scared. Scared of what? I wouldn’t have been able to articulate the thoughts, even if given more than ample opportunity. All I knew was either something was really wrong, or someone was playing a prank on me worthy of a world record title.

Not a minute had passed when I was jerked from my racing thoughts by a loud knock imminently behind me. Moving to my feet with such a speed I wouldn’t have been surprised if I had torn myself from my skin and left it in a wet coil where I once sat.
I stood there, motionless, staring at the only obstacle between myself and the knocking.
“Wh- who-” my voice all but faded, I cleared my throat and tried again, “Who’s there? This isn’t funny, man.” Although as steady as I could hold, my voice wavered like slack fishing line in the wind.

Nothing.

I could feel tears welling in my eyes as I closed them, hoping against all that this would just stop. Just go away. 

Again the knocking came, this time louder, more forceful than before, then a soft woman’s voice followed,
“Is that you, Steven?” the voice was off-putting, at first I thought it was one of my neighbours, Mai, but her voice was… different. Like it didn’t have any pitch variation at all, just monotone and flat.
“Mai? Mai is that you?” I called through the door, abject terror parting momentarily.
“Is that you?” her voice still sounded weird, but it sounded like Mai nonetheless,
“Mai!” I exclaimed, unlocking and throwing the door open, “You won’t beli-” I started to speak with returning clarity before stopping dead. 
In the doorway did not stand Mai, but rather a small bone box inlaid with pearl rest on my doormat…
I remember an energy running the entirety of my body in that moment - an energy unlike any I had ever experienced previously. Every piece of me begun to shake and wobble violently - after some thought I’m likely to believe that perhaps my body was flooded with adrenaline or what-have-you and that was my bodies ‘fight or flight’ response kicking in. 
In a sick irony however, I felt utterly unable to do either, and instead stood there like a cow in the headlights. My legs gave way after what was probably closer to seconds but felt like an eternity as I collapsed to the floor, jarring me from the mental coffin I subconsciously found myself imprisoned in. 
Scurrying to my feet and slamming the door closed followed by the bolt and the regular lock in as quicker motion as I could muster, I then braced myself against the door, shoulder first, with my legs locked firmly behind me. 
Every breath came more rapid than the last and it felt as if my chest would burst at any moment as I could feel my hot breathe dispersed by the wooden barricade reflected back against my face.

Scratching from the walls broke my concentration on my front door, the source however, was an enigma - feeling as if the direction rotated with my perception in an attempt to confuse me, I stood motionless staring about the room in rising confusion.

All sense of normality had left my body: anxiety fueled my every thought and uncertainty gave rise to abject terror - something was horribly wrong, every ounce of my being screamed it at me, to run: run like my life depended on it.

Chicken-skin struck as the hairs on my neck stood on end at my sudden realisation: The back door! In my haste to see who was outside my front door, I had forgotten to secure the back door…

Creeping around as if I was walking on proverbial egg-shells, my pulse driving any other sensation from my ears, I rounded my head from the hallway and eyed the back door - both the wooden door and the gauss door swung open with reckless abandon. I still feel as if I could drop dead on the spot whenever I think back to that scene… the barricades to my abode had proven as useful as wrist-bands at an orgy, and I stood motionless for more than I care to remember, awaiting my life to end at any moment.

The sound of metal being ripped asunder spurned me from my motionless gaze, it had sounded as if it came from next door - “Mai!” I exclaimed, control returning to me in an instant. Perhaps Mai and I didn’t know each other very well, but her and Steven were very nice people, and if whatever plagued me on this day had set it’s sights on her: I had to try and help her in some way. I would want help if the shoes were reversed…

Stopping only to slide a butcher’s cleaver from the drawer, I bolted out the front door with startling efficiency - held only momentarily by my attempts at security. Amazingly I had the presence of mind to slide the butcher’s utensil into the side of my trousers before exiting my doorway. If anyone would have seen me sprinting next door wielding a large knife, the cops would have been here in an instant. I kind of wish I had now; at least law enforcement may have been there, and maybe they would have seen what I saw…

Only when I replay the events of that day in my mind do I recall seeing the strange bauble affixed to my letter-box once more, the same hideous bauble I flung away with disdain not twenty minutes prior. At the time I did not hesitate in my strides to take note of such things - although I wish more than anything that I had.

Exclaiming, “Mai!” I pounded on the door with inexorable fury, desperate for an answer and swimming in adrenaline - naught.
Finding it hard to believe that noone would have heard my thunderous knocks I took a step back and charged her front door shoulder-first.
The jam stood firm and I bounced like a pigeon on a windshield - and it fucking hurt. Momentarily I dropped my arm limp, agony aflush throughout my system - a welcome reprieve from an endless onslaught of panic.
Subduing the pain I repositioned myself and laid by boot into the door-lock with all my weight. Again and again I drove myself into the stationary obstacle that defied me. After the fourth or fifth kick the door-jam splintered and the door gave way, echoing the abrupt sound throughout the house.

A wave of cold air hit me harder than a prime-mover hitting a deer on the freeway. 

As if on auto-pilot I immediately flung myself inside without a moment’s thought, stopped only by my bodies sudden reaction to the climatic change. I felt every muscle start to tighten one after another, beginning in my legs, and each breath became enigmatically visible - how could the temperature shift from a warm, spring day outside to such a frigid and incompatible climate?  And seemingly as soon as one stepped over the threshold inside.

Immediately aware of the choices I had made, yet resolved to continue forward for Mai’s sake, I gingerly took my first step since regaining control over my bodily functions.

Initially, Mai’s house looked as I had expected it - bar lights off where one would have thought they would be on if someone was home. I called out to her again,
“Mai! Mai, are you home?! It’s Allan! Mai, are you okay?!”
Nothing… not a shred of sound emanated from within her house.
Determined to find Mai I continued forth warily.

The lounge room: everything was neat and tidy. A good sign to her wellbeing I had thought at the time, but honestly - my house hadn’t been ransacked and I was scared out of my mind. Any attempt at regaining my composure was swiftly met at the guillotine as I eyed a small white box on her coffee table - a box made of bone and inlaid in pearl. Any chance I had at feeling in that moment was dwarfed when the same sound of metal being torn asunder assailed my hearing - my eyes moved underfoot to the vibrating floorboards I stood upon. Whatever that sound was, it was coming from underfoot; from underneath the house.

All hope I had desperately clung to was ripped from me like a pacifier from a newborn as I turned tail only to be met face to face with Mai.

I think I almost shit myself when I turned and found her there, staring blankly at me. I can’t blame her - her neighbour had just broken into her house and as far as she may have been concerned: I was there only for nefarious reasons.

“I’m sorry, Mai, you didn’t answer your door and I was so worried-”

Mai didn’t flinch.

“I’ve had the weirdest fucking day and I was worried about you guys-”

In my embarrassed state I minced over my words in a futile attempt to get Mai to understand me, but she seemingly didn’t care for a word that came from my mouth.

“Mai? Mai, are you listening?”

Mai continued to stare at me, or more, seemed to stare through me. I took a laboured step toward Mai as I raised my hand to gently place on her shoulder, feeling she may have been experiencing similar to what I had, stating softly,
“Mai, where’d you get that box?..”
Her attention shifted as her eyes focused on mine, suddenly aware of my presence,
“I thought you were at work.” Mai spoke, more a combination of words strung together than a coherent sentence,
“Huh?” the question had caught me off-guard, “I don’t work Tuesdays or Wednesdays… Mai? Are you okay?”
“Steven? Is that you?”
Her words made my skin crawl… something about her demeanour was very off to the Mai I infrequently spoke to,
“Mai. We need to go. Now.” I grabbed her wrist as I started back toward her front door, immediately thrown by how cold her skin was, and how loose… the skin about her wrist twisted like it wasn’t actually attached underneath - not unlike that saggy, granny-skin grandmas tend to get under their necks and about their arms.
“What the-” I let go almost immediately and turned back to Mai, “You’re so cold, come, lets get you out of here…”

No sooner than I had uttered the sentence, did I feel a warm, sharp sensation light up my back like a flare in the night. Wincing and stumbling as I turned back to Mai, only then did I notice her eyes in the lowlight of the small room - dull black orbs that absorbed any rays of light shining through the broken doorway that would so much as grace her face. 
“Steven? I thought you were rats?” her voice changed when she spoke the word rats: it sounded wholly different. She sounded like me…

“Mai?-” I choked out as my feet fumbled with every reverse step, “Mai? Are you okay?..” my voice little more than a light rasp.

Her sunken gaze never let me, standing completely still as I inched my way from inside her house.

Only when I had exited her house in full did I turn to run, to be met by law enforcement with firearms drawn and concentrated on me,
“Freeze! Hands up and get on the ground!”
I hadn’t heard a sound other than Mai and my own heartbeat, and their timing leaves me with many questions in hindsight. Honestly in that moment I was glad, I was glad to be met by another human-being on the front lawn. I was even glad to be taken in the back of the Pig-Mobile - at least I wasn’t alone.

Everything from that moment onward seemed rushed, or perhaps passed me by in a flash. Doctors all say the latter due to trauma of some kind; hence my ‘near-instantaneous mental decline’.

I was arrested and charged with Break & Enter, Possession of a Deadly Weapon, Criminal Trespass, Menacing Behaviour and Criminal Mischief… my lawyer argued for insanity, against my wishes, and ultimately that’s what was decided - I was declared Guilty by reason of Insanity.

The Doctor’s won’t listen to a thing I’ve had to say and have declared that I would be a danger to myself if let free and unmedicated. No so much a danger that I’m not allowed a few comforts such as pencils and paper; but allegedly enough of a danger that I can’t see myself outside these walls any time soon.

The skittering noise in the roof started only a few days after my arrival, although noone else admits to hearing it - it’s here. It’s always here…

This morning I could hear soft mumbling from the other side of my cell. Pressing my ear against the soft, padded wall, I focused intently - genuine interactions with someone outside the orderly can prove few and far between. 
I could only make out the last few sentences,
“Allan! Allan, are you home?! It’s Allan! Allan, are you okay?! You’re so cold, come, lets get you out of here…”

1klbseg,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1klbseg/where_the_water_falls_4634/,"Where The Water Falls [4,634]","Looking for some feedback. Kind of a hard idea to put on paper. It’d about a lonesome frontier’s men and his horse who can speak through his mind. 

⸻
Day 1
Hello

His eyes opened.

     Nothing but the unblinking eye of the horse. Filling his whole view. Wet and black and close enough to feel its breath in his beard. He jolted awake.  Reached for the rifle strapped to the saddle. But the horse shifted. Smooth. Quiet. Just enough to move it out of reach.
     It had moved before he reached. Before the thought even hit his hand. He’d been through this before. Men creeping. Wolves in the dark. He didn’t ask questions anymore. He just moved.

“Who’s there?” Nothing. Just the horse’s eye.

“Show yourself. I’ll shoot, fucker. I’ll kill you. 

From the depths of his mind. 

“Don’t be scared, friend.”

Calm. Clear.

“It’s just me.”

     He froze. No matter where he shifted, no matter how he turned, the horse’s eye stayed on him. Didn’t blink. Didn’t look away.

The horse stood still in the straw.

     Steam rose from its flanks. One dark eye fixed on him, round and wet and too calm for what it had just done—spoken. The man leaned against the post, heart still racing from waking. From that word.

“Hello.”

     It echoed, even now, though the air had gone quiet. He’d tried to grab his rifle again. Tried to move. The horse moved first. Like it knew his motivations before he did himself. 
And then the voice again, calm as a creek in spring:

“You’ve got two choices.”

The man didn’t speak. He found no words to say. 

“Stay here. In the quiet. In the cold. Wait for it to finish you.”

“Or come with me.”

     The man looked at the door. The boards nailed shut. The cracks that didn’t let in any light. No sound from outside. Just stillness. He stared at the straw. At his hands. At nothing. 
Then up at the horse.

“Why? Where?” he asked. His voice came out low. Dry. Rusty like a tool long buried.

“Where the water falls.” the horse said.
“Now it’s ready for you.”

     The man rubbed the bridge of his nose. The movement felt old. Like someone else’s hand.

He stood.
Walked to the saddle.
Checked the straps.
Didn’t rush.
Didn’t look the horse in the eye again.

“Fine.”

  No fight in it. No belief. Just the sound of a man with no more reasons not to go. He slung the rifle over his back. Stepped into the stirrup. Swung one leg over. Settled in. No kick. No command. The horse turned. Walked. Out through the stable door.
Out past the place where the world had ended.

“Fine,” his voice was not as hesitant as his face.
“Let’s go.”

  No pull on the reins. No words after that. The horse just moved.Out through the pine tree trail that marked the edge of his land. Past the last rusted traps, the broken fencepost. The places only he ever walked. He looked back at his stable and cabin. The logs ruff and even. One of the walls missing load bearing supports was beginning to warp and shift. 
     They crossed the clearing where nothing ever grew. Where frost never left.

And there it was. The tree.

   The bones hung from it like ornaments. Yellowed. Gnawed in places. Wrapped in old rope and dried sinew. Some dangled low. Some were wedged high where he could never quite reach again.

  A breeze came through. Shallow. Just enough to move them. The sound they made wasn’t like anything else. Wasn’t loud. 
Just a dull, empty jingle. Like something pretending to be a song. He built it. One trespasser at a time. Each one stepped over his line, and each one gave him a reason. He never buried them. Never wanted to.

   The bones didn’t really bring up memories. Just the faint pinch of an emotion. Not fear, nor anger, but an odd sense of pride. The trophy case of his survival. The fights he won. 


  They moved past the tree in silence. Bones still clinking behind them, soft as breath. The trail dropped off into rock and dust. Trees thinned. The air grew tighter. Familiar. He slowed when he saw the bend in the land. The low wash of stone and clay. The scattered stumps of old reeds.

He knew it before his eyes confirmed it.
The river.
   Or what was left of it. What used to snake through here had turned to dry, cracked shale. Mud hardened into dirt. Fish carcasses scattered along the bottom, some half-eaten by time, some stripped to white.
He dismounted without thinking.
Walked down the slope, rifle clinking against his back.
Standing in the bed. Kicking a brittle perch with his boot. It broke in half.
“This was it,” he muttered.
“Caught my dinner here. With twine and a nail hook. How’d this happen? I was just here.”
   The horse slid down after him. Hooves slipping a little on the slope, more ramp than riverbank now. It stood beside him. Looked over the ruin. Then turned the entirety of its body to face the man. 
“I cannot be saved,”
 The eye of the horse piecing through the questions in his mind, removing all other thoughts. 
“People have tried. I cannot be spent. I can only be wasted.”
The man stared at it.
“What the hell you goin’ on about?
I’m talmbout’ my river.”
The horse turned its head. Calm. Slow.
“Am I not?”
The man scowled. He was too involved in his surroundings to even acknowledge or even realize the horse’s riddle was a riddle. To him it was nonsense rambling. 
“Can you say one fuckin’ thing without tryna sound smarter than me?”
The horse didn’t answer. The man crouched and picked up a fish skull. Held it in both hands like it might say something. It didn’t. He tossed it behind him and stood. Cracks big enough for the horse to fall through ran like veins only maybe a hundred or so feet ahead of them. 
“Ain’t right,” running dirt in his hands like he would if there was water.
“This place fed me. Kept me. Now it’s just dead.”

“It kept you until it couldn’t. That’s all things do.”
   They rode on after that. No water to drink. No sound but hooves on hollow rock. No reason left but to keep goin on. The trail led out of the riverbed like it was trying to disappear.
    He followed it. The horse kept a slow pace. Dust puffed off the dry ground behind them. Sky stayed gray and wide, the clouds stayed still almost as if they had given up on changing.

   It was late, or maybe it wasn’t. He couldn’t tell anymore. The horse was slow and methodical with its steps. Every one seemed calculated as the two rode the sorry excuse of a trail. 

     Then the buildings appeared—half-sunken shapes in the dirt, slouched like drunks. An old mining town. Boards gray and curled at the edges, roofs caved in like broken chests. Nothing moved. No wind. No sound. But smoke curled from one chimney. Thin. Steady. He pulled the horse to a stop.
Watched it. 

    The rest of the town sat empty—storefronts shattered, troughs dry, signs faded to splinters. But that one house—just left of center, with green paint still clinging in spots—stood whole. He climbed down. The horse didn’t follow.
   He stepped up onto the porch. The wood creaked, but not like it meant to break. He knocked once. No answer. He pushed the door open. Warmth hit him. Woodsmoke. Bread.
The woman stood at the stove. She didn’t turn. Didn’t flinch.

“You hungry?”
  He didn’t answer. His mouth stiff and head cocked like a inquisitive mutt. She sliced the loaf. Placed it on the table. Poured coffee from a dented kettle.
  He sat. Ate. Drank. Didn’t ask questions. She didn’t offer any.

The fire had burned low.
Bread gone. Coffee gone. 
The man finally found words to say to what has been his first human encounter that wasn’t out to end his life. The first woman he’s seen since birth. 
“How’d you manage to git you’self the only building standing in this place? Ain’t no one lived here?”  The woman glanced at him like he broke an unknown rule. Then looked back at the empty plates on the table. 
“Musta been someone at one point I imagine.”

“You think they’d be back? I got a good rifle so I ain’t scared, just wonderin’ is all.” 

     The  woman looked him in the eye and took his hand, no words, she had no answer to his question, or not one she wanted too share. She led him to a room, the door needed a good shove as it grinned into the floor board as it opener. 
     He got this odd feeling again. Being led. The same feeling he gets from the horse leading him. The fear of the unknown. He takes himself as a brave man so he didn’t put up a fight. Her fingers had found his ribs in the dark. Her breath hot on his neck. For a moment, it had felt almost human. Then the horse shifted outside. Not loud. Just once.

     Footsteps. So many you would think it was choreographed to match the drumming and chanting that was booming in the distance. 

The woman froze.

“I shouldn’t have lit the fire,” she breathlessly announced. 

     The man sat up fast. Threw his shirt on.
Stepped barefoot into his boots and crossed to the window. Just shapes at first. Movement between the buildings.
Then the glow, low, flickering. Torches.

“Goddamn,” 

     He grabbed his rifle from the wall. Lever-action. Seven rounds.
The woman stood in the doorway, arms crossed over her chest. Not scared. Not surprised.

He looked at her.

“How many?”

She didn’t answer.

     Outside, they were chanting now. Screaming war cries and whooping and whistling. Silhouettes danced between the flames. Fast. Blurred. He couldn’t get a clean shot.
The door rattled in its frame. The horse was pacing in place, trotting like it was almost happy. 

“We need to go,” it said. “She brought this upon by lighting the fire.”

The man was determined.
“I ain’t leavin’ her.”

“You should.”

     He grabbed the woman’s hand, dragged her toward the back door.
She didn’t fight him, but she didn’t move fast either. The window’s all shattered almost in unison some from a club, or a butt stock. There was too much going on to care anyway. Several torches thrown into the house. 

An arrow hit the wall behind them. He yanked harder. The fire cracked. Smoke curled along the ceiling.

“Let’s go”

Then her body jerked in his grip.
Head snapped back.
An arrow bloomed from her eye.
She dropped heavy like a drunk’s boot heel. 
He didn’t stop.
Didn’t look down.
Didn’t curse or cry or pray.
He just ran.
Boots slamming on warped wood. Heat on his back.
The house behind him groaned and lit up in flames.

     He burst through the back of the house, rifle clenched, breath ragged. The air was thick with smoke and war cry’s.  The fire had taken the porch. Wood cracked and popped like gunfire. Heat slapped his face. He ducked low, boots pounding ash and broken glass. The horse was already moving, circling wide behind the buildings. Eyes wide. Mouth clamped shut.

     An arrow snapped past his ear. Then another. Then the crack of a musket.
He didn’t look back. Didn’t aim. He just ran.
The rifle bounced useless in his hand. The smoke blinded him. He followed hoofbeats, heartbeats, instinct. He reached the horse, threw himself into the saddle with one swing. The leather burned his leg. Didn’t matter.

“Go,” he said.

     The horse didn’t wait. It bolted. Arrows hissed through the trees. Musket balls tore bark beside them. One ripped his coat at the shoulder. Still they road. Over a bridge pulling together the banks of a dry creek bed. Past a crumbling stone wall.

     Until the fire was just a red blink behind them. Until the screams were gone. Until all that remained was wind and hooves and his own heart hammering like it meant to split him open.

The horse said nothing during the flight.

They stopped miles out.

      Near a stream that ran shallow and black over polished stone. The fire was gone now. The sky didn’t glow. The only light was the moon, pale and distant.

The man climbed down slow.

     Stood with his hands on his knees, breathing like he’d run from hell itself. His shirt was torn at the shoulder. Blood on his forearm. Not deep. He looked at his palm.
Still stained. Still warm. Not his blood.

He sat down hard, back to a rock. Stared at the dirt between his boots.

Didn’t speak. Didn’t blink much either. The horse stood nearby, watching.
Still. Silent. 
For a long time, there was nothing. Just the wind.

Then the silence finally broke. 

“I had her.”
No response.
“Was pullin’ her out. She was movin’.”
The horse shifted slightly, hoof pressing into soft earth.
“You were too slow.”
The man looked up. Not angry. Just empty.
“Could’ve made it. Another second—”

“She sealed it when she lit the fire.”
The man shook his head.
“She didn’t know.”

“That doesn’t matter.”
He leaned back against the stone. Rubbed his eyes.
“She was warm.”

“And now she’s not.”
The man flinched at that. Not because it was cruel. But because it was true.
“This always how it ends?” he asked.
“Every time I reach out?”
The horse didn’t answer.
“Could’ve let me have one night.”
Still nothing. The man reached for the rifle. Not to use it. Just to hold it. Like it was the only weight that still made sense.
He looked at the stars, far off and wrong.
“Guess that’s what I get.”

The horse stepped forward.

“The light of her fire, burned too bright. The warmth of her soul, brought in the cold.”

“Was tryin’ to save her.”

“No,” the horse said.
“You were trying to keep her for yourself.”

The whole day before rattled inside the man’s skull as he laid his bedroll down, and then himself onto it.
He didn’t speak.
Didn’t pray. Just pulled the blanket over his chest and stared up at the nothing.
He never thought too deeply about the odds and ins of the world. Never needed to.
Trees grew. Rivers ran. People came and died.
He hunted. Ate. Survived. That was enough.
But now, things were bending. The fire. The woman. The arrow.

    And worse than all of that. The voice. The line between his own thoughts and the disembodied statements of the horse were getting harder to draw. Sometimes it felt like memory. Sometimes like instinct. Sometimes like he was arguing with himself and losing. He closed his eyes. Tried to sleep.
But it came anyway:
“It was your hand that held hers.”
He opened his eyes again. Looked over at the horse. It was still. Standing near the edge of the trees. Back to him.
He looked back at the sky.
Didn’t reply.
Then—
“She died warm. That’s more than most.”
He grit his teeth.
“Stop.”
His voice cracked through the air like a whip.
The horse didn’t move. Didn’t speak, but the voice echoed again.
Fainter. Inside.
“You knew what that fire would bring. And you let it burn anyway.”
He sat up.
Ran a hand through his hair.
Looked at the rifle beside him. Didn’t pick it up. Didn’t move at all.

Just muttered:

“Ain’t no peace in sleep no more.”

Then laid back down: Eyes open until they decided themselves to close. 







Day 2

    Creaking. Clanking. Hooping and hollering.
Woke the man up. Down the trail, a covered wagon swayed side to side, rattling its way across the desolate terrain. A single donkey pulled it—legs wobbling, face halfway to dead.

“AYEE, AYE MISTA!”
A young boy—couldn’t be more than fifteen, shouted from too far off to make out the rest.

The horse, still in the same position it had held all night in the tree-line, moved its neck. Slowly. Almost mechanically. Like it was turned by gears. 
The man sat up. Reached for his rifle. Scurrying, but quiet. 
The wagon rolled closer. 
Eight… maybe nine people inside.
Didn’t matter.
Anything over seven was too many.

“That rifle doesn’t carry the proper amount of ammunition.”

The horse’s voice wasn’t warning. It was just… observing. Daunting in its calm.

“I know.”

The man checked the rounds anyway.
There were two, maybe three little girls he’d spare if it came to that.

Not the boy.
He was already annoying.

“AYE, AYE MISTA, MISTA LAYIN’ THERE IN DA ROCKS!”

The boy leaned out through a massive tear in the wagon’s west canvas, clinging onto the exposed frame like a crow.  The wagon groaned to a stop. The donkey wheezed once, then stood trembling, eyes rolling white.

A wide man with no shirt and too much belly waved from the driver’s bench.

“You seen a girl?” he called. “Ours.”

The man didn’t answer. Just stood halfway behind his saddle, rifle low but visible.

One of the women in the back leaned out. Missing a few teeth. Hair in braids that didn’t match her age.

“Tall. Pretty, kinda. She run off.”

The boy clung to the wagons exposed skeleton frame like it was his job.

“She’s my sister!” he shouted.
“She got in trouble for killin’ her fella!”

The man blinked.
The horse turned its head, slow.

“She gone and stuck a knife in his chest,” the boy said, proud.
“Right through his damn shirt.”

The father scratched his beard.
“Ain’t the first time she got ideas. Last time she near ran off with a preacher.”

The woman laughed. “And his wife.”
More laughter from inside the wagon. One of the girls banged a spoon on a rusted tin plate. One of the others was making a doll out of straw. 
The man said nothing.
The boy tilted his head, squinting.

“You seen her?”

The man stared. Then slowly shook his head.
“No.” 
The father spat into the dirt.

“If you do, tell her Pa says come home. We’ll forgive her, long as she says sorry.”
The boy piped up:
“We’ll bury the boy clean if she asks real nice!”

The wagon lurched forward again. Wood groaned. Metal scraped. The donkey groaned and dragged the thing forward like it had nowhere else to go.
The horse watched them go. Didn’t say a word.

Not yet

The wagon creaked back into motion, vanishing slow through the trees. The man watched until they were just shadows behind the dust.
Then he said or thought, he can never tell if he says what he says aloud anymore. 
“Hopefully they don’t run into them injins.”
Dry. Disingenuous. No weight behind it.
The horse shifted its stance. Tail flicked once.
“ You could care less.”
The man didn’t blink. Didn’t nod. Just stood there, rifle across his chest, eyes on the trail. Because the horse was right.
They both knew it. 
The dust from the wagons oddly speedy departure hasn’t settled yet. It hung in the air as if it found a home in the atmosphere. It matted the man’s nostrils. A sandy film lines his mouth. 
He spits onto the dirt. 
“Lets follow the tracks.” 
The man stared the tracks down like he hunting the thing that made them. 
“Why?”
“You want too.”
“Don’t mean nothin’.” 
“Then it won’t hurt to look”
He kicked a loose stone on the ground and watching it roll for a second before mounting the horse. 
“They ain’t worth follwin’ you saw em, they look like they musta came from less then I did.” 
   The horse said nothing. Just followed the tracks. The man just along for the ride. Stared off. Into a forest so thick it swallowed the moon. 
The woods swallowed them too.
    Pines crowded thick around the trail. Tall, black shapes knotted into each other like they’d grown that way on purpose. A raven cawed from the distance. The man flinched as if it came from right next to him. 

   The wagon tracks were easy to follow. Too easy. Clean, like the forest had made room for them. No branches broken. No mud ruts. Just prints and lines in the dirt.  The man rode in silence. Boots resting easy in the stirrups. Rifle across his lap. But his jaw was tight. The deeper they went, the quieter it got.
   Just the sound of hooves on pine needles and the  occasional creak of saddle leather. After a while, he felt that itch between his shoulder blades. Like he was being watched. He turned once. Slowly. Scanned the trees behind them.

   Nothing. Nothing for hours. Hours of a single ravens caw. He hasn’t seen a bird. Now that he thinks about it he didn’t see any yesterday either. Just more black trunks. More silence. The feeling didn’t leave.
“You feel that?” 
The horse didn’t answer.
“Like something’s back there.” Still nothing.
    He licked his lips. They were dry. Looking down at the tracks again. They were starting to change. No longer just wagon wheels. Now he saw bare feet. Lots of them. Different sizes. Some dragging. Some tiptoeing. He didn’t say anything. Didn’t stop.
 His fingers curled tighter around the rifle.
    He didn’t know where this trail led. He’s never even seen these woods before. The wagon tracks curved off the trail, into a patch of woods where the pines grew tall and tight. The horse slowed. They came to a clearing. Small. Cold. Still.
   At the center stood a pile of stones. Blackened at the edges. Scorched like from an old fire that never quite went out. 
   Around it were twigs bound in twine, stuck upright in the dirt like crooked little people. Some lay broken. Others leaned on each other like they were too tired to stand.
But at the very center—propped on top of the stones—was a doll. Burnt near to ash.
 Laying face down. Dress shriveled tight around its stick limbs, but still faintly green beneath the char. The man stared at it.
He knew who it was meant to be.
He stepped closer. The ground gave soft underfoot. Boot prints circled the shrine. The tiniest set of foot prints led to the doll. 
Wagon ruts stopped just beside it. The family had been here. They built this. Left it behind like a gravestone. He felt his jaw clench.
“You think this is her?” Grabbing the doll and rolling it in his hand the man saw something else. A detail to small to be a coincidence. 
A tiny arrow. Jammed through the eye of the doll. 
He was still knelt over the shrine. The doll heavy in his hand. The horse didn’t answer. 
“Listen.” 
 The air had gone still again. Too still.
Then—creaking, rattling and cracking.
    The slow, crooked rhythm of wagon wheels over packed earth. He froze. The wagon was coming into the clearing. That’s when the smell hit. Burnt. Almost a little sweet, it coated the mans entire soul. He’s never smelt this smell before, although he knew just what it was. He stood, slowly turned. .

The family rode inside. Grinning. Like they were out for a picnic. The father raised a hand in greeting.
“How?” The man was asking himself, the horse heard the thought. 
“Doesn’t matter, pay attention.” 

“Well there you are,” he said, cheerful. Brown juice leaking out of his smile. 

“Didn’t think we’d catch you standin’ still.”
The man didn’t speak. Didn’t move.
The boy popped up from the side, eyes squinting.
“You were at the house.”
The man stared. The boy’s grin didn’t fade.
“I saw your tracks. All around it. You was there when she died.”
    The man opened his mouth. Closed it again. The smell of the burned girl drifted off the wagon. He didn’t want to look inside. He did anyway. 
In the back, a little girl sat with her head down. The body of the woman. Her sister, lying next to her. 
    Quiet. Working her fingers over something in her lap. A bundle of twigs. A figure. Man-shaped. Horse beneath it. The man felt something tighten in his chest.  The boy’s smile dropped.
“You kilt her, didn’t ya?” 
The man gripped the rifle, his hand in the lever. Ready. He hates to admit that this is his favorite feeling. The horses voice came low inside him. 
“Remember that rifle holds seven rounds.” 
The man didn’t need a reminder. That’s all he could think about. 
“Stay calm. The man is armed. The boy too.” 
The father spit his chewing tobacco out, half of it made it down his shirt. The other half stayed hanging down his beard. 
“Was you there? When she burnt.” The dip swung back and forth, making its way down like molasses. 
“Tell him you tried to save her.” 
The man didn’t hesitate to take the horses guidance. It was true after all. 
“Tried to save er best I could. Some injins started burnin the place down.” The man kept scanning the family and surroundings. 
“So yous watched her burn? That’s bout the same as kiltin her ya own self.” The boy was more annoying than before. 
“I tried, she got hit with an arrow while I was dragging er out boah.” 
The boy seemed to be enjoying this. 
“How we’s sposed to know you ain’t start the fire?”
“Cause it wasn’t the fire that killed er but the arrow boah.” 
The horse chimed in. 
“They want to pull something from you. Don’t let them.” 
The father wiped his beard with his right hand, then immediately pulled it behind his back. 
The horse gave the call “Now.”
A round cracked from the lever action. 
One
“You have 6 rounds left.”
     The father felled like a rotten tree. When his jaw hit the ground his mouth opened, then a lip of chew rolled out like a dice. The man worked the rifles lever. A spent casing pinged off a stone and disappeared into the brush. The boy charged the man with a knife too big for his own good. 
     He hit the ground with a thud right if front of the man after the butt stock made contact with his forehead. A small ribbon of red snaking from the spot of impact, flowing into the dirt. 
The woman on the driver’s bench started screaming—high and ragged. 
The others followed. A chorus of wailing, shouting, fists pounding the wagon boards.
    Two of the women dropped to their knees in the dirt. All the other boys too young to be a threat screamed and cried. 
    They surrounded the father’s body. Grabbed the boy and rocked him like he was dying. He probably was. The donkey just blinked. Steamed from the ribs. The man still stood there. Rifle pointed in their direction. Unwavering. 
But the girl— She never moved. 
Sat cross-legged in the back of the wagon, right where she’d been.
Hands steady. Wrapping twine around the figure in her lap.
The little man on a little horse.
Same rifle. Same horse. Same silence.
The chaos swirled around her. She didn’t look up. Didn’t blink. Just looped the thread again, and again, and again. Tighter each time 
“We must go now.” 
The horse was standing in the same spot the whole time. His voice wasn’t stern or demanding. It didn’t have to be. The man walked backwards to the horse. Rifle still at the ready. Just in case. His feet crunched bone dry pine needles.

    Following the tracks, still the man kept looking back at the family. Still mourning, carrying the little boy and the man into the wagon. He didn’t look forward again until the trees covered the scene. After a couple more yards the trees absorbed the cries too.

My child is 7, the stains started showing up probably late last year. I can scrape them but it takes time and have to be very gentle. 

I thought the toothbrush needed to be replaced. I got an electric one, didn’t work. I thought it wasn’t strong enough so I got a different brand. That one was too harsh on their gums. Went back to regular hand toothbrush. Their cleaning appointment finally came about a month ago. Teeth were cleaned. Dentist said it can happen with people who take medicine with iron in them. That not our case. No trauma to the teeth. After the cleaning all spots were gone. By the second week, they started showing up again. I’m at a loss and it is really stressing me out. Very few offices take their insurance but I would really like a second opinion.

I'm pretty shy, so for most of the year I wasn't really friends with the seniors. For whatever reason, in the last month or so I've been getting close with a few of my classmates, but especially this one girl. I'm finding it super hard to tell if she would genuinely want to keep being friends after she graduates. She acts like we're super good friends in person and will comment on my Instagram and stuff but never really reaches out first over text or Snapchat or anything. I'd really like to become better friends with her, but she has sort of a nonchalant personality so I can't tell what she's thinking. We have one AP exam left and then we might never see each other again. There's a good chance I'm going to attend the same college she's going to, so if we become friends we could still see each other all the time in a year.

1klbhcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1klbhcz/i_wish_i_was_never_born_to_see_that_day/,I wish I was never born to see that day,"So my school holidays were going on, and my family thought that we should go out somewhere. Then in the evening we were having dinner when papa came home. He told us that he has planned a trip to the far away islands of Indonesia. Me and my younger brother were very happy to hear this. Mummy did not like this that much. Papa asked him what happened, mummy told him that there are only some islands of Indonesia which I have not yet fully explored and the island which papa had booked is also one of those. The name of that island was ""Bunuh bunuh island"" its English meaning is ""Kill Kill Island"". People say that dangerous tribals and strange things still roam on the deserted islands of Indonesia. One such strange thing is ""Orang itu"" whose English translation is ""That Man"". It is believed that very few people have seen it, then it can be said that very few people have survived who have seen it. And people believe that this Orang it lives in the Bunuh Bunuh Island. After hearing this, me and my brother got a bit scared because we were kids that time, and we would naturally be scared of such things. Then papa said to mummy, “It's nothing, these are just old stories made up by old people, nothing more than that, such things do not happen in today's time”. After hearing this, we felt a bit better and then mummy also agreed to go. 


- The day before going on a trip- We started packing because we had to go on the trip the next day. We were taking all our essential things like torch, lighter, etc. Papa came from outside after some time, he had gone to get some stuff but this time there was a stranger with him, Papa introduced us to him, ""Kids, meet him, he is my old friend Michael, he has travelled to the islands of Indonesia and he has agreed to go with us"", ""To go to such deserted islands, one definitely needs a guide, so it will be right to take someone along"", mummy said. Michael said, ""Hey kids, how are you both?"" ""I am fine uncle"", I said, then he gave us two toffees. He was a little fat and his eyes looked like those of an Asian. He must have been 50-60 years old. He had a straw hat on his head, farmer style, but despite all this, the strangest thing about him was his eyes were completely lifeless. This seemed a bit strange to me but due to the happiness of the trip I did not pay much attention and then Michael left. He said that he would come at 7 in the morning with the car. 

- Trip day - I was so excited about the trip that I couldn't sleep at night. I did not even realize when I fell asleep at night. Due to this, I was late in the morning and Mummy bit me hard, I woke up at 6:23. Then I went to the bar and started getting ready. Mummy brought breakfast. I don't remember it well but she had prepared some really plain breakfast. While we were having breakfast, we heard the sound of a horn from outside. Papa went and saw Michael standing inside. He had come to pick us up in a blue coloured van. Then after finishing breakfast we loaded the stuff into the car. Then the car started and we left for the trip. Idk maybe it took 1-3 hours to reach the airport, then we boarded the plane. It must have been 1-2 hours after boarding the plane. I was hungry and was waiting for the airhostess. When she came, I took a packet of snacks and gave a magazine to everyone. Most of the people did not even read the magazine and just kept it aside. I also did the same. Then I started feeling like it, so I picked up the magazine and started reading. On its last page, in a small box, it was written ""INDONESIA THE TREASURE OF TERROR"". It mentioned the amazing things about the islands of Indonesia. I had written about sightings, after seeing the title I thought it was a movie, and then I fell asleep and within 4-6 hours we were done. And then we went out and started looking inside. We saw a deserted old cabin. I and my brother lifted 2 small and thick suitcases and Mummy also lifted a big suitcase and Michael was also helping us.
Papa, we did not look towards the big cabin ahead, thinking there might be someone inside the cabin, but there was a man inside the cabin, he was the ranger of that place. Papa said to him ""Hey Officer"". He did not say anything in reply for 30-50 seconds, then he said in a deep voice ""Selamat datang di pulau kotor"". Its meaning is ""Welcome to the island of Gross"". Michael told us this, he knows Indonesian language. , Then the Ranger said ""Take care"" and gave Papa a Tomahawk (a spear that can be used to throw axe) and then Michael said ""This is your true companion in the jungle"" then we started walking ahead. I was just thinking that where will we stay in this jungle and what will we eat, I asked this to Papa and he told me ""This is not an ordinary trip, this is a camping trip, we will have 3x more fun in this than a normal trip"" I got very excited hearing this because after seeing camping trips in cartoons I felt that our camping trip will also be very fun but..... fate had something else in store.


We were just about to enter the jungle when it started raining and then we reached the cabin of some ranger at the door, where we stayed for 1-2 hours till the rain stopped. On this beach the ranger made hot coffee for us and after giving us coffee he started telling us about his jungle adventures, how he became a ranger from a simple 20 years old young boy, he told that there are more than 50 people on this island, during this conversation mummy asked him ""have you ever seen anything strange on this island"" the ranger said on hearing this ""cough if you want to live peacefully in this jungle then don't think about it and it will be better if we don't talk about it"" After hearing this I felt strange and also scared. By the time the conversation ended the rain also stopped and we had to leave the cabin inside. Maybe 3-4 o'clock in the evening. Komodo Dragons roam on these islands at night. That's why Papa and Michael started making a shelter. Michael had an 18-inch machete and he was collecting sticks with it for shelter. And Papa was collecting Vines wagera with the Tomahawk, it was 5:30 and it was completely dark all around, Mummy lit a fire with a lighter and Papa brought the fiber of an old coconut tree nearby and we started a bonfire with that, Michael was telling us stories of his old days, and I, my brother and my Mummy were making marshmallows and some other camping snacks in front of the bed, and in the middle of this we heard that sound...

It came from deep inside the jungle, that sound was as if it was the mixed roar of a goat and a mountain line, it was a sound that was to be heard in the ear, it echoed in our bodies after hearing it Goosebumps came, Papa and Michael took their weapons and then Michael said, ""I will go and see, you all stay here"" and then Papa said to him, ""Okay you be careful, I take care of them here"" saying this Michael disappeared into the jungle. We were just waiting for Michael to return, 1-2 hours had passed, we were just waiting for him, then Papa tied a fiber to a stick and set it on fire, this was their only source of light because Michael had taken the torch, now Papa also went into the jungle, we were very sleepy After 1 hour papa came and he said “Finding someone in such a big and deserted island in the darkness of night is like searching for a sheep in the forest, and I searched almost the whole island but I could not find Michael anywhere”. So thinking that we will get up in the morning and search for Michael, we all went to sleep. To tell you the truth, at that time I was feeling very scared. We were all alone on such a deserted island, that too without a guide. While thinking so much I fell asleep and went to sleep. After waking up in the morning, we ate just one can of canned food and got ready to search for Michael. We divided ourselves into 2 teams, me and dad in one team, my brother and my mother in another team and then we went to search for him. We were checking every bush and tree thoroughly, but it was very risky too because dangerous Komodo dragons live in most of the islands of Indonesia, which are also called the Dragons of this era, and if anyone among us gets bitten, there is no hospital here to help us. The more we were roaming in the island, the more we were shocked. On one side there was dangerous poisonous Ivy and on the other side there were bushes of wild berries, on one side there were big dark trees and on the other side there were beautiful colorful trees, it had been almost an hour and we had still not heard from Michael, so we returned and by mistake came near the Ranger's cabin, we went inside, we thought that Michael must have come here by mistake and must be sleeping inside, we went and knocked on the cabin door, then the Ranger came out and said ""what happened?"" Papa asked him ""what Have you seen the man coming with us?"" He said ""Oh real!"" (oh shit that's what it means) He asked ""why did you make us go out at night???? Don't you know about oranges? Now you can't even use God"" After saying this he closed the door with force.

We then started to panic, my health had worsened due to the fear. We went back to the jungle. Papa said, ""We will just take your mom and brother and go from here. We will not stay here even for a second. Why didn't I listen to your mummy…"" Then we started to look for brother and mummy. Half an hour had passed. We heard a loud scream. It was mummy's scream. It was coming from the west side. We both went inside the door. We saw my brother and mummy standing like statues and my brother was crying. I then went closer and asked, ""K-Kya H-HUA MUMMY A-WHY DID YOU CRY?"" Mummy without saying anything pointed her finger ahead and we saw on the other side...Michael's dead body.

That corpse was in very bad condition, probably in the worst way a human could ever imagine, his head was split in the middle, his face was split in two but it was still attached to his body, one of his hands was separated from his body and the intestines inside his stomach were all out, all the flesh on his chest was missing and right next to that carcass was a Komodo dragon which was eating Michael, but but but, the most terrifying thing was that when this was happening to Michael he was alive… yes he could feel that pain when he ate the Komodo dragon He was lying there, Papa seeing that he was alive went to him through the door ""MICHAEL! MICHAEL! HEY ANSWER WHO DID THIS TO YOU?!""
Michael somehow said
""O-O-ORA-A-NG ITU-U""
""WO-O-OH R-EA-L H-E!""
""T-TU-UM SA-ABH BH-AG J-AO!!""
Michael broke his last breath by saying this. Without even a second's time we started running away, without carrying any equipment we were just running, the jungle which we were able to cross easily a while back seemed like a maze, in whichever straight direction we went we kept coming back in the same direction, from above in the jungle the sound of monkeys was coming from the tall trees which was making the atmosphere even more frightening, I and my brother started crying, papa held my hand and mumny held my brother's hand and then we were just running like blind deer.

We were all very tired, around 2-3 We were running in a loop for hours and there was no way out but our body left us, ""If we keep running like this on a deserted island, it will just be a waste of energy"", my mother said. Then we all sat down in one place to save our energy, we took a protein snake each, then mother said, ""The compass is not working because of the magnetic fields here, maybe if we reach the tree somehow and keep going in the direction where the sun is setting, we can get out of the island"", then my father heard this there The tree that climbs the easiest started climbing.

The most traumatic event of my life happened in this very beach.

I saw a black figure in the jungle far away… he was very short and was at least 10 feet tall. As soon as I looked at him, he quickly ran away from there in a second.

Then I turned around and looked at my brother…

WOH, that wasn’t it!!

I shouted ""MUMMY!!! Brother is not here""

Mummy was taking water from the nearby river for us, then she turned around and saw that brother is not here

She started panicking

""Oh shit what happened!!! Oh Ram what happened, how will we search in such a big jungle now,
Why did you go to me to fill water?"" After saying this she started cursing herself and started crying, to tell you the truth it is not her fault, if there is any mistake in this it was my mummy who was filling water, I was just sitting idle and I used to stay with her My brother is lost,

Mummy's crying Sun's father came down from the tree,

""What happened? You have to say everything right, he is a second child???""

Mummy started crying louder

Papa understood what had happened

Without saying anything, he caught me and Mummy and started running towards the outside of the jungle. After 20 minutes we almost reached outside the jungle, then we heard the same roar...

But this time there was a child's voice too,

Yes, that voice was not anyone else's but my younger brother's, he was screaming in pain so loudly it seemed that his vocal cords would burst, Mummy was insisting that they should let them go, their child is in trouble, I was crying ,
Mummy fainted due to this shock, Papa also had tears in his eyes but he knew that if we follow that voice, none of us will come back alive today,

We had just reached the beach outside the jungle, then suddenly Papa stopped

I saw my tearful blurry eyes

I swear, I have never felt so disturbed

Those were blotchy figures but this time we were able to see every detail of his body in the light of the sun.
He was looking like a cave man, he was very muscular as if a Olympic body builder, he had hair all over his body and his face looked like an animal of the same species, there was blood all over his chest and he was licking it in his mouth

My younger brother's head

Papa could not control himself after seeing this, his tears were falling out, I screamed as loud as I could, the vocal cords of my cheeks were damaged,
Papa closed my mouth with his hands, he kept watching this for 5-10 minutes, then he went away without doing anything, taking my brother's head in his mouth, as fast as we could To get out of the island we went towards the ferry parked on the beach, we were lucky the ferry was still there otherwise we would have had to stay there another day and don't know what would have happened to us.

I can never forget that scene

When my mother regained consciousness she started crying. I and my father did not tell her what we saw. 6 months after this incident my mother and father got divorced.

I wonder what would have happened if my mother had put the head of her beloved son in the mouth of such a thing....

1klbfqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/1klbfqx/professional_musician_with_ssnhl/,professional musician with SSNHL,"hi there. just found this sub. i’m a professional musician (M50) and was diagnosed in late March with SSNHL in my left ear. i saw ENT within a few days of symptoms. The hearing loss in my left ear is all low freq. I was given high dose of oral prednisone for a week, and that seemed to help (ENT didn’t give me the shots). I have also been on diuretic for several weeks and that also seems to have helped. But my low freq hearing has yet to regain much (my low freq tinnitus is mild to moderate); though what has felt like intense pressure in my ear over the course of these weeks has seemed to reduce with the diuretic. I have a MRI scheduled next week and rheumatologist appt for full immunology work up. Obviously I have cut sodium and have quit coffee. 

I’ve really been in a dark place these past many weeks (and i’m not a dark, depressive person). Luckily, I have been able to perform on the concerts I had scheduled, but i haven’t taken any more upcoming gigs and i stopped all of my audio-editing work. I also run a music publishing company, so performing/editing isn’t my entire income. But it is a substantial part, and obviously music is a massive part of my being… practicing, performing, listening, thinking nearly nonstop about music most days. 

I’ve been a musician longer than I have memories from my life — started taking piano at 5 and went all the way to a doctorate in music performance. During these past weeks my wife and kids have been hugely supportive of me, and my colleagues/bandmates have also been a great help emotionally. But I’m still in severe shock, tbh. 

My original ENT is great; she’s highly experienced, but I have an appt with another ENT this month for 2nd opinion — a specialist for performing artists (i’m in NYC, so hoping the resources here can help!!)

I guess I’m just posting here for any advice or especially in case there are other musicians who have gone/are going through this, too. 

ok. thanks for reading.

1klbf22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Machupicchu/comments/1klbf22/peru_trip_report_43059/,Peru Trip Report: 4/30-5/9,"Just returned from an incredible trip to Peru, and I'm excited to share my experiences and tips!

**Itinerary:**

* **2.5 Days in Lima**
* **1.5 Days in Cusco**
* **1 Day in Sacred Valley (stayed in Aguas Calientes)**
* **2 Days in Cusco (including Machu Picchu)**

**Lima**

I found that 2 days was a perfect amount of time to explore the city's highlights. Lima is mostly known for food.

* **Day 1:** I started my day by strolling through Kennedy Park, where you can see the many cats. For lunch, I highly recommend Punto Azul for some amazing ceviche. In the afternoon, I walked it all off with a visit to Love Park and a pleasant walk towards China Park.
* **Day 2:** I took a city walking tour that included tickets to the Catacombs, which was very interesting. In the evening, I headed to Barranco for dinner and drinks (Clon is a must-try, so make reservations!).
* **Day 3:** Since I had some extra time before heading to Cusco, I visited the Huaca Pucllana ruins. While interesting, I wouldn't say it's a top priority if you're short on time since you'll see plenty of ruins around Cusco.

**Cusco**

For Cusco, I used CuscoPeru Travel Agency to book accommodations, tours, and transportation. While this was very convenient, it's worth noting that booking everything individually could be cheaper. I just didn't want to deal with booking Machu Picchu tickets/trains/bus! You could also do the popular 4-day trek to Machu Picchu, but I'm not much of a multi-day hiker.

Cusco's high altitude is something to consider. Some people fly in and immediately head to Ollantaytambo (the train station for Machu Picchu). However, I chose to stay in Cusco to acclimate and relax.

* **Day 1:** I grabbed a quick breakfast sandwich at the San Blas Market and then explored the city on foot. San Blas is a charming area with lots of stairs, art galleries, and stunning views.
* **Day 2:** I took an afternoon city tour and explored the surrounding areas. It's not essential if your time in Cusco is limited.

**Sacred Valley and Aguas Calientes: En Route to Machu Picchu**

I spent one day touring the Sacred Valley, which helped me get closer to Ollantaytambo. I stayed overnight in Aguas Calientes, the town at the base of Machu Picchu.

* **Day 1:** I visited Pisac and Ollantaytambo. If I could do it again, I would skip Pisac and instead visit Moray and Maras before heading to Ollantaytambo. The train ride to Aguas Calientes from Ollantaytambo takes about 1.5 to 3 hours. 
* You can't bring large luggage on the train, so you'll need to leave your suitcase at your Cusco hotel and bring a smaller bag or backpack for the night. All hotels are used to holding luggage for travelers visiting Machu Picchu.

**Machu Picchu and Return to Cusco**

* **Day 1:** I took a 30-minute bus ride up to Machu Picchu. I did Circuit 2, which offers the classic Machu Picchu view and allows you to explore within the site. I spent about 2-3 hours at Machu Picchu. After returning to Aguas Calientes for lunch, I took the train back to Ollantaytambo and then a 2-hour drive back to Cusco. If I were to do it again, I might consider staying overnight in Ollantaytambo to break up the long travel day, depending on the next day's plans, as most tours depart from Cusco.
* **Day 2:** The next day involved an early 4 am departure from Cusco for Rainbow Mountain, which is about a 3-hour drive away. Breakfast and lunch were included in the tour. This hike was my biggest concern due to the altitude, but it was surprisingly ok. I strongly recommend taking altitude sickness pills! The views at Rainbow Mountain were absolutely worth it.
* **Day 3:** On my final day in Cusco, I relaxed and visited Three Monkeys Coffee (reputed to be one of the best in the world!) and ate at/explored the San Pedro Market. I also treated myself to a spa day at Antigua, which included a hot tub, sauna, and massage (highly recommended!).

Cusco has a wide variety of highly-rated restaurants (4.5 stars and up), making it hard to choose. I ended up eating at Local twice because it was so good!

**Overall Tips:**

* **Safety:** I felt safe throughout my entire trip so it was nothing to worry about.
* **Cash/Tipping:** I tipped around 10% if it was great customer service. It’s not required but they will ask if every time if you are using card. It’s good to carry cash in Cusco/Aguas Calientes/Rainbow Mountain for water and little things.
* **What to Pack:** Bring layers, including a rain jacket or poncho, a hat, and sunscreen. The weather in Lima is warm, but it's much colder in Cusco and at Rainbow Mountain. We went at the beginning of dry season, but it was still rainy so I recommend going around mid to late May if you want to fully avoid the rain (and even then it's a toss up)
* **Altitude:** Bring altitude sickness pills, and avoid drinking too much alcohol in Cusco, especially the night before visiting Rainbow Mountain.",3,1747104742.0,Machupicchu,2,1.0,False

Cons - I fell into the FOMO last year and bit the bullet to pay for $200 / ticket, got lucky to see an artist I like, but would probably wait to pay the secondary discounted tickets next time.

Neutral - met some cool peeps, but f&ck the people who were smoking cigarettes during the concert, audio was good, didn’t think it was terrible…. (Was located about 5 o’clock from main stage in line with the lights

1klbdui,https://i.redd.it/2bzvvw0wpg0f1.jpeg,Wondering what rug to put here?,"Hey folks,  
  
I’m furnishing a 3.8m x 4.1m living room that’s leaning toward a modern Scandinavian aesthetic, light neutral sofa, timber floors, minimalistic feel with earthy accent cushions. I’m looking to add a rug to ground the space, but I’m not sure what size would work best.

The rug size options available to me are:

* 230x160cm
* 280x190cm
* 320x230cm
* 400x300cm

I’d love some input on which one would suit the room best, ideally something that works under a 3-seater sofa and coffee table without overwhelming the space. Should I go with the 320x230 or 400x300, or would one of the smaller ones still look okay?

I'm also looking to get a 2 seater couch to run perpendicular to the 3 seater, once i've saved a little more :)

Last week I got a call from someone wanting to do a consultation. I had a short window open today, so I squeezed him in. Sent him a little form to return to me with some basic info to fill out and email back. Well, he never sent it back which happens a fair amount of the time. Didn’t cancel on him or anything because stuff happens and we can work around it. 

First thing this morning I got a phone call. Went something like this. 

Policeman: “Hello, my name is Mr. Policeman. I’m sorry to catch you off guard. I understand Mr. Consult called you at (insert extremely specific time) last week. Can I ask you some questions about that call?”

Now I’m thinking this is super weird and suspicious because we don’t do criminal defense and a police officer has no business calling to ask me about my communications.

Me: “Well, I’m sure you’ll understand that I can’t confirm I’ve received calls from any person, or provide details about the contents of any calls I receive.”

Policeman: “Yeah I figured and I understand. I’m just calling because Mr. Consult was found deceased and we believe his time of death was very shortly after a call placed from his phone to this number. It’s a routine investigation and we just want to know if it was him, what his demeanor and mood was, stuff like that. If you decide you have anything to offer, just call me back at this number.” 

Me: “… okay, thank you for the call.” 

Well, I was wondering if it was just the most dark prank call of all time. Didn’t clear the appointment because… maybe it was a mistake or something? Called to confirm the appointment and got his voicemail. That made me nervous.

About 10 minutes before the meeting was set to start, I got a call from his daughter. “I’m so sorry to call last minute and to have to deliver this news, but my dad died a few days ago, so he won’t be making it to his meeting with you.”

So instead of being productive, I spent that window of time sipping my coffee and staring off into the abyss while contemplating the brevity of life and what I’m doing with mine. So how are y’all doing today? Because I’m doing weird. ",80,1747104462.0,Lawyertalk,25,0.97,False

1klb7mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1klb7mx/surely_im_doing_something_wrong_here/,Surely i'm doing something wrong here...,"So over the last 2-3 months i've been actively dating. Now, i can't say i've actively tried to date ever, i've always been reactive to potential advances not making the moves myself. However, In the past 2-3 months I have went out with 5-6 women, each a stronger connection than the last and half of them making it to the 2nd and 3rd date..... Honestly I'm surprised i've went out with anyone with how low my confidence as been historically... This is where the positives stop....

Despite any chemistry, no matter how strong, for some unknown reason after 2nd/3rd date, no matter how well they say it's going theres 1-2 days silence or spotty texting and then ""i don't think we're a good fit"". No matter how much they claim they're happy with how its going or what. They all claim i've done nothing  wrong or ""im so thankful to have met you"" or whatever, but they never stick around. I don't quite know what's happening or why everything seems to fizzle out when it seemed so intense. For example the last one we saw each other from 3pm-1am, a whole afternoon/evening together, spoiling each other with gifts and such, \*intense\* chemistry and over the weekend....it just died off randomly. I don't understand man. It's so confusing...

I am half tempted to reach out to some women i've met IRL that i used to work with, one in particular we went for coffee just to catch up and were there for 4 hours just talking and it was a great time, but i had much less confidence then so idk if i burned that bridge or if i should even ask about it or what. Still have a few possible leads online but i'm wondering if these IRL ones could be better even though we haven't spoke since i left work in some cases or since post-coffee meet for that one. Probably worth noting i've liked the woman i went to coffee with for years and always thought  she had a partner. She subtly implied she didn't but we haven't spoken since about a month after that.

If you want to suggest something, go ahead, im open to it.",1,1747104070.0,GuyCry,3,1.0,False

Accommodations: I mentally prepared myself for a cramped space but the room didn't feel small at all! No complaints. The couch and the bed gave us our own separate spaces when resting between activities. I highly recommend the balcony. It was so nice to go outside or open the door for some fresh air whenever we wanted to. I spent hours during the Glacier Bay day reading on the balcony (the observation bay was packed) which was a wonderful and peaceful experience. Probably the best environment I've ever read in. We requested a mattress topper and a coffee maker for our room which were essential imo. 

Excursions: The transportation was terrible. In Ketchikan, they transported us in kids school buses. We couldn't sit normally because the seats were so close together and went over some major potholes on the way back. My fiancé has back issues and this really hurt her for the rest of the day. It was far more jolting than the Galaxy Pavilion rides which had specific warnings for people with back injuries. If I had the knowledge I have now, I would've arranged a shuttle or uber and booked the tickets directly with the lumberjack show to save money. In Skagway, they moved us from a little building designed to give protection from the wind and had us wait in the parking lot for 25 minutes for a late bus. It was incredibly windy and the windchill made it an uncomfortable endurance. Thankfully, we weren't late for the excursion and the bus journey and driver was comfortable and entertaining once it begun. In Juneau, the shuttle line looked to be a 45min-1hr wait so we took an $8 uber instead which was money well spent. 

The excursions themselves were fantastic. The highlight was the White Pass railway. Incredible views and we enjoyed standing outside on the train car through the mountains. Panning for gold and the lumberjack show were both fun.

Food: The specialty restaurants were amazing. We had the More at Sea package which came with 3 specialty restaurants and we ate at Cagney's, Scarpetta and Le Bistro. Being able to order 3 appetizers and 3 desserts EACH for these meals felt extremely generous and most of them were so delicious. We also felt very attended to by the waitstaff. 

The Local was nice for breakfast, as was the buffet. Taste & Savor was decidedly average, never terrible, never great. The kitchen was backed up the second time we dined there and we ended up leaving before dessert because we had to see a show. Not a big deal and that was the only instance we had a wait time. We realized that a significant amount of food on their menus were also available at the buffet and we became buffet diners for our nonspecialty meals after that. I enjoyed the variety and quality of the buffet. 

The drink service was good. They had an interesting variety of bars (mojito, whiskey, wine, brewery, among others).  I rarely had to wait more than a minute to get my drinks and it was nice to be able to get two at a time. 

Cruise Activities: I'm not typically a theater guy but the Choir of Man was an engaging performance. I liked the Beatles band and the casino, although it was interesting how they had to shut it down whenever we went into port. There always seemed to be something going on in the Atrium, which made for a fun hangout whenever there was nothing else to do. The games when they included people from the crowd were entertaining. It was warm enough to sit outside in Spice H2O and people were in the pool during the sail away party. Other than that it was too cold to sit above deck but that's what I expected. 

Disembarkation was smooth. We left our room at 8am, ate at the buffet until they announced we had to leave at 9am and walked off the ship with no line. 

Overall: Great vacation. 8/10. I'm curious to how NCL relates to other cruises and how our experience compares to other's NCL experiences. We went on this trip not really knowing whether we'd be ""cruise people"" but we had a fun time and I think we'll be booking another cruise next year! Any suggestions of where to go or how we could improve our next cruising experience are appreciated!",3,1747103999.0,Cruise,2,1.0,False

**Unpacking “Based Zeus - The GOD Approach”: Real Talk About Dating in 2025**

# What Is “Based Zeus - The GOD Approach”?

Let’s start from the top: *“Based Zeus - The GOD Approach”* is not your typical dating advice course. This is a **no-BS, results-based dating blueprint** created by YouTuber and dating coach Based Zeus. Unlike cheesy pickup artist routines or outdated “playbook” tips, this course promises real-life skills that help you talk to, attract, and date women *naturally*—without needing movie star looks or being a smooth-talking sleaze.

The key theme? **Dating is a skill you can learn.** And this program is like a cheat code to level up fast.

# Who’s It For?

This is for **guys tired of feeling stuck**—the ones who see girls they’re attracted to but freeze up. If you're the overthinking, anxiety-prone type who’s always in your head, “Based Zeus - The GOD Approach” is meant for you. Whether you're a complete beginner or someone who wants to improve their game, Zeus lays out a **step-by-step framework** that helps you stop overanalyzing and start taking action.

Spoiler: You *don’t* need to be tall, rich, or ripped.

# Why Does This Course Matter?

Simple: it *actually works.* Most dating content is either outdated, creepy, or vague. Zeus changes that. He includes **live infield footage** where his manager Benjamin does real cold approaches—like, literally talking to women on the street—and scores instant dates. These aren’t theory-based lectures. They’re **real-life breakdowns**, showing what works and why.

So why does that matter? Because seeing real success makes it way easier to believe it’s possible for *you* too.

# What’s Inside the Course?

Here’s the juicy part. The GOD Approach includes five core modules:

* **Mindsets of the GODS** – Reset your brain to build confidence and magnetism.
* **CRUSH Your Approach Anxiety** – Kick fear to the curb with tools that actually work.
* **Building Sexual Attraction Through Conversation** – Turn small talk into flirty fire.
* **How to Open Conversations Like A GOD** – Learn exactly what to say to start strong.
* **Real-Life Infield Breakdowns** – Watch real interactions, learn from breakdowns, and model success.

Each module builds your dating skillset like stacking LEGOs—except instead of a castle, you’re building your dream dating life.

# When and Where Can You Use It?

The beauty of “Based Zeus - The GOD Approach” is that it’s designed for **any place, any time**. Zeus promises that you’ll be able to approach women and start meaningful conversations whether you’re in a **party, coffee shop, or walking down the street**. It’s all about being spontaneous, grounded, and authentic—without needing some ""perfect scenario.""

Whether you’re in New York, London, or some tiny college town, the skills you gain here **transfer everywhere**.

# How Does It Work?

Here’s the truth bomb: attraction is about **how you make her feel**, not how you look. “Based Zeus - The GOD Approach” gives you *the mindset* and *the tools* to radiate confidence, have fun conversations, and get girls intrigued—and chasing.

You’ll learn how to avoid the friend zone, stop freezing up, and build **romantic tension naturally**. Zeus isn’t about tricks—he’s about **authentic value communication**.

# Final Thoughts: Is “Based Zeus - The GOD Approach” Worth It?

If you're done watching endless dating tips that go nowhere and want **real, actionable strategies** that make sense and deliver results, this course delivers. “Based Zeus - The GOD Approach” isn’t just another dating gimmick—it’s a legit framework that turns average dudes into confident, dateable men.

I’m in the early stages of exploring what it would take to open a small coffee shop in a California suburb — think more family-oriented, middle-income area than bustling downtown. I’ve worked in a few coffee shops in the past but never run one myself, and I’m trying to get a clearer picture of what’s realistic before diving too deep.



A few things I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been down this road:



* **Startup costs:** What did it actually cost to get your place open? Anything that totally caught you off guard or ended up way more expensive than expected?
* **Revenue:** If you’re open to sharing, what does year 1 revenue typically look like? And how long did it take for you to hit breakeven?
* **Monthly overhead:** What are your biggest ongoing costs outside of rent? Curious how labor, supplies, utilities, and things like POS systems shake out.
* **Lessons learned:** Anything you’d do differently if you were starting today? Was a full business plan worth it, or did you figure most of it out as you went?",1,1747103885.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False
1klb5ff,https://www.reddit.com/r/becomingsecure/comments/1klb5ff/releasing_the_need_for_lots_of_contactcontrol/,“Releasing” the need for lots of contact/control dating,"I’ve posted here before about the feelings of limerence and obsession I’ve struggled with over someone I’m dating. I like this person a lot and we’ve been seeing each other for about five months, but we haven’t talked about being exclusive or “official” (I need to have this conversation with him at some point; I’m just avoiding it because I’m too afraid of possible rejection).

I have been doing a bit better at letting go of my anxious thoughts throughout the day and focusing on constructive things! On bad mental health days, I am tempted to think obsessively about how the person I’m seeing is probably “over” me, seeing other people, bored of me, etc. Some of this anxiety has intensified lately, because he has not been messaging me as much. When we meet in person, we have nice, long conversations and he expresses interest in spending time with me.

We got coffee today and he mentioned a couple other ideas for things we could do together in the future (seeing a play, etc). It seems clear that he does want to continue spending time with me. He also explained that he’s been trying to spend less time in his phone, which he said is why he hasn’t been as responsive to me on Snapchat.

I felt reassured when he said this, but I also feel like I need to relax into more reduced contact between dates — both because he expressed that he doesn’t want to be on his phone as much, but also because messaging him has been causing me anxiety. I would keep conversations going to enjoy the reassurance that he was still responding to me, but if I was on delivered for more than a few hours, my anxious thoughts became a lot worse. It kind of seems manipulative for me to start conversations to reassure myself, even though I didn’t always realize I was doing it.

I guess what I’d like to do is relax, release control and detach from him a little more for the time being so that I can maintain a handle on my own anxiety. Instead of maintaining banter and small talk over text to quell my own anxiety, I want to give him some space. I also want to enjoy the time we spend together more fully when we do get to see each other, instead of being so hung up on all the “what ifs.”

It’s just so against my own nature to do any of this. Do any APs have advice? I am already fighting the temptation to reach out to him again, but I’m reminding myself that another text exchange will just create anxiety for me.",2,1747103878.0,becomingsecure,0,1.0,False

 She's in a completely different department from mine. Luckily I'm only working at this location for another month Or so before I go elsewhere. So having to deal with any sort of awkwardness at work won't be an issue

I'd like to ask her out for some coffee during the weekend. But it's very hard to get her alone and not have an audience to do so. I'm only able to speak to her alone on a rare occasion. I'm talking like once a week...

I'd do it in person because it's way better, but I made this note in case I couldn't... it's also easier too. Would it be
 a turn off ? (Note in comments)

I'd probably pass her the note and say something dumb like ""Hey, you dropped this"" and give it to her folded and walk away, lol

Alternatively, I could also ask one of her coworkers if she's single, because I don't even know that to begin with, haha

It was a beautiful Friday day. We were busy the whole day. 500+ transactions. Cold brews were pouring, espresso shots were remade multiple times before they were served. Ice machine broke down so a coworker walked to a deli to buy all of their ice, iced lattes, iced americanos, iced matches, iced packs. We sold everything including the crumbs from the croissants. 3:55pm and we were done. When all of the sudden a group of Europeans walked inside. Hair slicked back, sunglasses, I thought they worked for Nike since every piece of clothing they were wearing was made by Nike. They each had one of each of what we had already pre-closed. My coworker under his breath cursed in his native language, the atmosphere was tense, I served the drinks and explained they had to enjoy their drinks outside because we close at 4pm. They walked outside and enjoyed the most delicious coffee they ever had along with their cigarettes. 

It was 4:01pm. The record for this particular location for one day’s sale was $4.990, for over a year. I was closing register and my coworker asked. How much was it today? 

I looked at him, then looked at the screen again. This Friday, it was $4.985 and change. I looked at the coffee beans shelf and picked my favorite. A Columbian single origin. I walked towards it and picked up a bag. Punched it in (I left the discount out) charged my card. I looked at my coworker and said. “Today, the owner made $5.008.” He said “Wanna grab a beer after?”

1klb0zh,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1klb0zh/step_mom_from_hell_just_want_peoples_opinions_on/,Step mom from Hell!!! Just want people's opinions on the situation.,"Disclaimer: All people within the story are of legal adult age. My sister was 18 and just graduated at the time. I was 20 and just graduated after being my mother's nurse for 15 years. My brother was 31, helping to fix the house and help pay bills. My father was a 56-year-old at the time, and Jane Doe was 54. My mom had a myriad of health issues before passing. She had stage 5 kidney failure and was on home dialysis, and required me to help her set up her machine at night. As well as assist with med distribution. My father helped with none of that while she was alive. My Sister was just freshly out of high school and just trying to start her life. My brother was recovering from a mental breakdown that almost cost him everything before moving back in with us. My Father was just a dick. 

Backstory: It begins like this;

Our mom passed away on December 18th, 2018, after a long life of health problems. So we all knew Christmas this year was gonna be a shit show. Fast forward to the second week of January, and our family is trying to put together my mom's memorial service. We get most of the details worked out and go about life as one does after the loss of a loved one. As the weeks flow together, we notice that our father is kind of down in the dumps, worse than we had seen before.  This kind of sadness continues for another couple of weeks. February rolls around at this point, we can all collect ourselves enough to start planning the memorial services. We get the details of those set in stone, we decide to have a local memorial for our mom shortly after for our church family and friends. 

A few days, maybe a week or two after the local memorial service, our dad has to go to the bank to settle some accounts and whatnot. My siblings and I, still reeling from the tragedy that took us all by surprise, are at the house when my dad comes home from the bank, happier than we had seen him in weeks. We were almost worried he had a psychotic break at the bank. Now we weren't rich by any means, gracefully low-middle class. So for him to be that happy after such a tragedy, plus to have just gotten back from the bank, was strange. As the little sleuths, my siblings and I began to ask him if everything was okay. He tells us that he made a ""friend"" at the bank that day. He tells us that she is a very nice lady and has also just recently lost her husband. So, as his kids, we were like, well, thank god or whatever higher power was at work that day. Because he has a friend to talk to about grief, and he won't be so hard to manage. Which seems harsh, but it was a rough couple of weeks after Mom had passed. So my siblings and I are happy for him at this point that he has a local friend to talk to. Little did we know that was the worst decision we made. He began to talk to her more and hang out with her like maybe one or two times, for coffee or food. We got through the family memorial we had that March. About a week later, my father says he would like us to meet this new ""friend"". So like the gracious kids we are, we agree cause he still seems happy even though our household was in disarray and our financials were a mess. As his kids, we persevered and agreed to meet with her. For the sake of privacy, we will call her Jane Doe. At this lunch, we all seem to get along, my siblings and I are a little confused by why we are meeting this ""friend,"" Jane Doe. But we are fine with it, about a day or two after meeting her, we realize that they are extremely close to each other, after just a month, after each of their loved ones had passed.

So we go about life as usual and are asked by our father if we can be nice to Mrs. Jane Doe, so she knows that we like her. Well, we think nothing of it at the time and go about life doing our normal things. Till my father had her stay over for the first time, and well, this Jane doe was like a rat you can't get rid of. So she begins to stay with us, aka just move right in. Jane Doe then begins to try and insert herself into mine and my sister's conversations regularly. Even starts to give my brother the creeps. We went on a trip to visit family, and my dad invited her so she could meet my mom's parents. During which she made the entirety of my family uncomfortable with the massive amounts of physical displays of affection. She then tries to befriend my grandparents, who have just lost their oldest daughter. After the trip, she began to almost buy us, or so it seemed. Instead of getting to know us she would just buy us random crap we didn't ask for or want. Before my sister and I (mostly my sister) sit her down and are like, hey, we don't need all this stuff, we need other things like our light bill paid or our water bill paid. We don't need any more useless stuff. Again, we are still being nice at that point. My father then pulls me aside and says I need to start being more appreciative and kinder to her. So, granted, I was not very nice about it, but had already tried the nice thing, so what can I say? I am a little bit of an asshole for this. So my sister, who was genuinely being nice to Jane Doe, tries to explain that I am still processing our mom's death and that it's a little hard on me. So Jane Doe takes this and thinks she needs to start doing more. Well like I said I'm an asshole. So she continues this behavior of inserting herself in conversations and trying to act like she were a 20-something as a 60-year-old. So I fully admit I used her for the free stuff, because she seemed to be the only one who could get our father to pay the bills somewhat on time. So I begin to play like I'm her friend.

One time, my dad and Jane Doe went and picked my sister up from work….. Jane Doe sees a wild animal on her Ring doorbell and decides that my father needs to speed home so she can save her cats. They end up getting pulled over, and Jane Doe gets out of the car and is screaming and walking towards the officers. After not arresting Jane Doe, they agreed to let them go with a warning, leaving my sister traumatized and bewildered. So a little while goes by, it is as far from normal as one can be, but hey. So after a few weeks, my dad decides to rewrite his will and it now includes his new friend and her children to get all of his possessions instead of his children. Meanwhile my siblings and I are just trying to work to keep the lights on while my dad and Jane Doe are gallivanting around West Virginia and Tennessee every weekend. The bills start to pile up, my siblings and I are like What do we do. So we sit down with our dad, and he decides that it's just too much money for him to be going to her house, and that she should just move in. So she moves in, and it only gets worse from there. 

Again, it starts awkward and weird, but we are adults, and it's whatever ever at least the bills are getting paid. My sister starts working a different shift that gets her more money, and my brother is picking up more shifts for the same thing. Well, a few weeks go by, that sharing a room with my sister with different shifts wasn't the best idea. Considering I worked days as a nanny and she worked nights. An My father had moved into Jane doe’s house at that point. Well about a month or two goes by and my father and Jane Doe decided to move back in so they could use her trailer as a “Weekend house”. So I moved out of their old room to the couch in the living room. Well Mrs. Jane Doe then decides to trape across the house like goddamn elephant at 4 am waking the dogs, my siblings and I.  by turning on every light in the dang house. So from there it just seemed to get worse. She then started to complain that we were using their bathroom too much, granted, it was the only working bathroom in the house at that time. Then from there it became well that this was her house too, and blah blah whining to my father. So one night, while my father and Jane Doe were staying at her house for the night. My brother decided to talk with me just to say hey, you gotta try and be nicer to her and be more ""respectful"" of them keeping the peace, kind of thing. So we do it for about a month or two. As the holidays approach, granted its our first holiday season without our mother. My father says he is having Jane Doe join us, and she wants to help. My siblings and I are trying to be supportive, as this is our first holiday season without our mom, to which our father is oblivious. He even brings her with us to the grave site. Talk about awkward.  

We somehow dredged our way through the holidays, and feeling all the feels. We get through December when jane doe decides that it's okay to start changing things around the house. She makes the decision to remove all the pictures of our mom and put up pics of her instead. Including the most awkward family photo ever, my brother wasn't even there and my sister had been cropped out. During this time, my sister and brother are telling me to be nice, be nice, blah blah. So I begin to be ""Nice"", I kindly let my brother and sister know, and go about life as if nothing changed. I Begin to hang out with her again and she is none the wiser that all of the compliments are more sarcastic than Bill Hicks on a good day. She then finds out that my mom had a bunch of health issues and whatnot. So she then brings all of her little health “problems” to me, like her on-call nurse. She then uses that as a gateway to try and be like my mother in the most Coraline way possible. 

 Being that I'm kind of a dick still I tell her all the problems are fine and she will be okay. Even tough I'm not a licensed professional. Well, fast forward to the next few days, she then begins to tell my sister and I on a forced bonding trip. That she is not trying to replace our mom and that we don't have to call her mom. To which my ass unthinkingly says that's fine we never thought you were and that unfortunately that's shoes she could never fill. Well, that seemed to send things into a real bad spiral, cause you're right again it went downhill. She tells my father about it and that my sister was some mastermind of evil, and that she convinced me and my brother to treat her poorly. As well as that I couldn't possibly of said anything or done anything mean to her.  When my sister defends herself, she says “You think that I would come up with that.” she just tried to reassure her that she is being nice and she is trying to stop me from being a dick.  My brother and I both come to her defense and are like, yeah, that's something I would do to someone. I even after I told her that if I'm going out of my way to be ""nice,"" chances are I'm not being nice. So, for some reason, this changes the narrative to now my sister is being rude and that she didn't want Jane Doe in the house, and she was the reason we were broke all the time. (Not the trips every weekend out of state during Covid had anything to do with it or the fact that my literal teenage sister was genuinely being nicer than I ever was..) But anyway, I kept being a dick despite my sisters and brothers best efforts.

After that whole conversation with Jane Doe, I decided my mother's pictures needed to come back out.  I also needed to up my game if she wasn't going to get a clue. So I started to make my comments a little more brutal. My brother got the other bathroom working again, so we weren't in their ""space"" anymore. Which also meant that our laundry room was working again. Which after a period of not having a washer laundry does pile up. Jane Doe took that as a personal attack. So she once again complained/whined and I kid you not literally cried. To my father full temper tantrum style. That we were trying to keep her from doing their laundry to make her look bad. As well as a way to push her away and not “make room” for her in our lives.   So we came up with a laundry schedule that she never could figure out so it was always an issue. I mean, it wasn't our fault she was incapable of human comprehension, right? 

I digress that we were trying our best to get along. Well, by this point, my brother was working so much that his mental health was deteriorating. My sister was too stressed with school and work. On top of being worried about what Jane Doe would say next to try and get her kicked out. So I’ll admit that I used Jane Doe’s deep pockets to fuel my Bad habits. Meanwhile, nobody is worrying about the bills. Once again, as it always does, bills became due, and my dad would take it personally and lash out by screaming/ slamming all the things he could. While putting the blame on my sister and I. cause we haven't been helping enough or making Jane feel welcomed. So he just all together stops paying altogether and just does what he wants with Jane Doe and leaves us to our own devices. They for all sense of the meaning, moved out and I can't stress that enough. We think this is the best thing to have happened in years. Well, we get the bills straightened out and we get all the stuff almost to a good level, I mean no money for groceries, but hey, rice and chicken broth never gets old. My siblings and I handle all the bills as best we can and try to keep food on the table while taking care of my dads dog that my dad had just left behind. 

My sister finally got to go to school. Things were looking up. Well, all good things must come to an end, right? Once again, Jane Doe and our dad move back in and make her house their ""weekend house"". Well of course shit hits the fan once again and my siblings and I are left with a deadline of we have to be moved out by September that year. So we start to freak out wondering; What are we going to do? So we all go about our lives figuring it out. All the while trying to dodge my father and Jane Doe within the house. We get ourselves together and Jane Doe just still isn't satisfied for some unknown reason and decides to try and be mine and my sister's “friend” again while treating us like crap. We have to be ""nice"" and during this time Jane Doe decides to lose all sense of the meaning of boundaries and decides to walk into mine and my sisters room repeatedly unclothed throughout the months of us getting our stuff together to move out. She would also walk around complaining that ""her"" house is a mess. All of us were still trying to keep the lights on in the house and keep what little peace we all had left.  Like clockwork work Jane doe starts up again, and brings my father into it more now. It also mostly seemed geared toward my sister for some unknown reason now. Jane Doe tries to be our ""Friend"" again. Shortly after with the  same stuff different label all over again. We all get out of the twilight zone and begin furthering our lives. Until about a two years later our  father  tried to contact us and be all buddy buddy again. Asking why we don't ever answer Jane Doe or why we never contact them. There are more stories than the ones I highlighted here; these were just the basic rundown of what happened.

1klay85,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1klay85/the_bull_next_door/,The Bull Next Door,"Part One: The New Neighbor

We moved into the cul-de-sac in early spring. Quiet, manicured, suburban—just the kind of neighborhood that lulled weak men into thinking their world was secure. Men like my husband.

He called it “home”.

I called it safe. Sometimes with a smile. Sometimes with a sigh. 

The day the house next door sold, I was rinsing a wineglass in the sink—bored, barefoot, still damp from a lazy shower.

He called me over with the same dull enthusiasm he used for coupons and forecast updates.

“Looks like the new neighbor’s here.”

I padded to the window and sipped what was left in my glass.

Then I saw him.

Tall. Confident. Sleeveless shirt sticking to a body that didn’t just work out—it dominated. He moved like the sun warmed him harder than it touched anyone else.

I lifted my chin, tilted one shoulder back, let my mouth curl around the rim of the glass—and stared.

He moved like he knew people watched him. And I did. Longer than I should’ve.

I let a soft hum slip from the back of my throat. Just enough for my husband to hear.

That was the moment. He wouldn’t admit it, but I know it curled something in his stomach.

“He’s probably some gym rat who plays music too loud,” he muttered, drying his hands like a man clinging to whatever masculinity a dishtowel could offer.

I didn’t respond. Not to him. I whispered instead to the wineglass:

“I hope he plays it really loud.”

—

The first week passed in quiet little rituals. Coffee. Mail. A glance.

I lingered at the window most mornings, pretending to admire the sky while watching something far more interesting.

My robe slipped just low enough for the breeze to do what my husband hadn’t in months—notice my body.

By Wednesday, I’d made up my mind.

No banana bread. I wasn’t some apron-wrapped cliché.

I pulled a bottle of Pinot Noir from the rack and a fresh wine opener from the drawer.

He caught me at the counter, applying lipstick.

“You’re… dressing up?”

I didn’t even glance at him.

“I’m being polite.”

The dress I chose wasn’t fancy. Just honest. Soft cotton. Fitted. The kind of fabric that hugs the truth.

It slipped around my hips like a secret and dipped low enough at the neckline to invite consequence.

“He just moved in,” I added, stepping into heels.

“It’s rude not to say hello.”

I didn’t invite him to come with me. I didn’t need to.

—

Jordan’s house was unassuming from the outside. Inside? Minimal. Confident.

Cool gray walls. Bare floors. A single speaker pulsing low music in the corner, like even his silence had bass.

He answered the door like he’d been expecting me.

Took one look at the bottle in my hand—and then at me. And smiled.

“Perfect timing,” he said, stepping aside.

I walked in without hesitation.

—

He opened the wine one-handed, like it was a reflex.

Poured two glasses and handed me the first without asking how I liked it.

I didn’t need to be asked.

I took it and leaned one hip against the counter, watching him move—quiet, slow, unbothered.

His presence didn’t fill the space. It claimed it.

He poured his own and let the silence stretch.

It wasn’t awkward. It was curated.

He let me be the first to speak.

“Settling in okay?”

He nodded once. “Yeah. These houses are close. Good views.”

I raised my brow. “That a complaint or a compliment?”

He sipped. “Haven’t decided yet.”

—

We stood there longer than polite.

The wine was dry and dark. The air warmer now.

Rocket circled once, then dropped near my feet like he’d chosen a side.

Jordan stayed exactly where he was. Watching me with that calm, unfazed attention. Like he already knew the difference between company and opportunity.

And I let him.

I swirled the wine in my glass, tilted it toward him.

“Next time I’ll bring something better.”

His voice didn’t lift.

“Next time, you don’t bring anything but time.”

That’s when I smiled.

That’s when I knew.

—

I didn’t rush leaving. But I left on my own terms.

And when I closed his door behind me, I didn’t just feel watched.

I felt remembered.



Part Two: The Cracked Door

That night, I went to bed early. No kiss. No soft goodnight.

I left my phone in the kitchen—and my vibrator on the nightstand.

The door stayed cracked. Just enough.

Not for airflow. For effect.

I made no effort to muffle the sound. Not the click as I turned it on. Not the moan I let slip three minutes later—low, breathy, just loud enough to carry through drywall.

I even let the sheets rustle. Rhythmically. Recklessly.

He could hear every pulse of it from the couch—the steady hum, the breathless shudder, the silence that followed.

I didn’t say his name.

I didn’t say any name.

But in the dark, I smiled.

Because he’d spend the rest of the night wondering:

Was I thinking about Jordan…

or just making sure he heard what wanting sounds like?

Either way, he didn’t sleep.

—

Saturday gave us sunshine—bright enough for short tempers and shorter fabrics.

I made a little show of stretching at the sink, then casually mentioned wanting some color.

He perked up, hopeful, like that meant togetherness.

Sweet.

I disappeared into the bedroom and emerged in my black one-piece.

Plunging in the back, high at the hips, unapologetic.

Paired with oversized sunglasses and a slow walk to the yard, I didn’t need sunscreen.

I was the heat.

He followed like a trained pet, carrying a folding chair and a pitcher of lemon water like that counted for something.

I picked the lawn spot closest to the fence.

Jordan was outside. Shirtless. Predictably.

Rocket barked once and trotted circles around him like even the dog knew where power lived.

I waved. Jordan waved back.

My husband didn’t.

I laid out on my stomach, adjusting my straps with just enough intention. My back arched, my skin caught the sun, and if I looked posed—good. I was.

I stayed there long enough to feel him watching.

Not Jordan.

The one behind me, pretending not to notice how much of me he’d stopped being allowed to touch.

After twenty minutes, I sat up—slow, deliberate—and stretched. Arms overhead, hips angled. The kind of movement that says admire me, without asking.

Jordan noticed.

He looked up from Rocket’s water bowl, eyes trailing my frame without apology.

“You always stretch like that when someone’s watching?” he called out, amused.

I let the strap slip just enough to tease the curve of my shoulder.

“Only when it’s someone worth watching back.”

He smirked. “Good to know.”

We didn’t need more words. That wasn’t a conversation.

It was an agreement.

My husband sat behind me somewhere, trying not to react. Trying to pretend he still had a place in this story.

But my body radiated more than sunlight.

And the silence beside me?

It wilted in comparison.



Part Three: The First Knock

I waited until nightfall to push things further—not with words, but with footsteps.

He went to the guest room first. That’s where he sleeps now. I never told him to leave the master bedroom—he just did. The silence had already said enough.

I gave him twenty minutes to pretend he had privacy. Then I found him in the laundry room, folding one of my silk camisoles with a kind of reverence he used to save for anniversaries. Good. He was soft. Ready.

“I want you to prepare the bedroom.”

He turned slowly, like he already knew what I meant. I didn’t explain. I didn’t repeat Myself.

I placed the linen spray in his hands. The expensive one with the black matte label and gold cap—the one he knows better than to touch. Then I handed him a folded pair of briefs. Not his. Black. Smooth. Jordan’s size.

“Lay these at the foot of the bed. Neatly.”

Then came the final detail. I dabbed perfume at My wrists, then extended the bottle toward him.

“One spritz. On My pillow only. Don’t waste it.”

He nodded, eyes low. And I turned, pausing only once in the doorway.

“No sitting on the bed,” I said without looking back. “That space isn’t for you.”

—

He smoothed the sheets like they mattered. Fluffed the pillows like they were sacred. Placed the briefs like an offering. The perfume hit last—sharp, floral, unforgettable. The scent that would cling to Me later like proof.

I know he lingered after, breathing it in. Staring at the bed. Wishing.

He left the door cracked. Not out of indecision.

Out of hope.

—

Then, at 9:12, the doorbell rang. My lips curled. Jordan was prompt.

I passed the cuck in the hallway. He didn’t speak. He didn’t move.

I wore black. Not lingerie. Not modesty. A robe that barely covered what I’d already decided to give.

I opened the door. Jordan stood there, calm, tall, already halfway inside Me with just a look.

“Evening,” he said, eyes trailing low before they rose again.

I stepped back without a word and let him follow. Down the hallway. Past the cuck.

Two sets of footsteps. One soft. One heavier. Real.

The door closed behind us.

—

I stood at the foot of the bed and let the robe fall—not for Jordan’s benefit, but for the ritual. For the stillness between breath and surrender. For the man who would hear it and know he wasn’t welcome.

Then Jordan’s voice.

Low. Calm. Certain.

“Don’t look away. Watch what we do to each other.”

—

He waited outside the bedroom door, spine pressed to the wall, hands flat to the floor like he could absorb something through it. I hadn’t told him to kneel. But I hadn’t given him permission to leave either. And he understood enough now to treat My silence like a rule.

—

The first sound wasn’t speech. It was motion.

The bed shifting.

Skin against skin.

A slap—firm, not cruel. A reminder that I was alive and being worshipped in the most delicious, carnal way.

I laughed. Not loudly—just honest. That soft, unguarded sound you make when someone else is listening and you want them to suffer for it.

Jordan’s voice again, closer this time:

“On your stomach.”

I didn’t tease. I didn’t test. I moved, and Jordan moved with Me.

The pace shifted—deeper, faster. Gasps turned to moans, moans into something rawer. There was no pretending now. Just rhythm. Sweat. Truth.

Jordan didn’t take. He met Me—push for push, breath for breath. Every sound we made was earned. Created. Mutual.

I pressed My face into the pillow. The one the cuck had prepared. The one he’d misted with linen spray, hands trembling, thinking he was honoring Me.

And I said it clearly—intentionally—so the hallway would catch it.

“He’s outside.”

Jordan chuckled—not cruel, just knowing. “Good.”

Another thrust. Sharper now. A breath stolen from My mouth.

And then I said it again, louder:

“He needs to hear it.”



Part Four: The Obedience Ritual

When it was over, Jordan kissed Me once—slow, warm, final.

Then he stood. Reached for his jeans. I reached for his shirt.

We dressed without speaking. Not rushed. Just… knowing.

He smiled as I slipped it on. Loose. Still warm. Still his.

“Looks better on you,” he murmured, voice thick with satisfaction.

He grabbed My hips. Held Me there for a second. Like a man reluctant to leave something he’d just ruined beautifully.

Then we walked together. Toward the door.

He opened it. Slowly. Deliberately.

And there he was.

Still kneeling.

Still waiting.

Jordan didn’t step around him. Neither did I.

We stepped over him.

Both of us.

Like he was furniture. Forgotten. Decorative.

Jordan chuckled under his breath as we moved past. I didn’t look down.

He walked ahead to the front door. I followed.

The door clicked behind him.

And I let the silence stretch.

Then I walked to the kitchen.

Poured a glass of water.

Sipped.

And called out, smooth as silk:

“Come.”

—

He rose too fast, stumbled into movement, and followed.

He stopped in the doorway like he wasn’t sure he was allowed past the frame.

Good. Let him question everything.

I didn’t look at him until I was done drinking. Then I set the glass down and pointed down the hall.

“You’ll fix the bed now.”

I walked first. He followed.

The bedroom smelled like sex and my perfume. The sheets were twisted. A condom wrapper still lay beside the nightstand.

He stopped. I didn’t. I let him take it in.

I pointed again.

“Fix it.”

He moved quickly and removed the bedding. Fluffed the pillows. Picked up the wrapper like it might burn him and dropped it in the trash without a word.

When he reached for the laundry basket, I stopped him.

“Leave the sheets.”

My voice was steady. Controlled.

“I like the way he smells.”

—

I stepped closer. Not for kindness—for control. I let him feel my heat, let him smell everything on me that wasn’t his.

Then I touched his cheek with one finger. Just enough pressure to brand.

“You did well tonight.”

That was all he got. That was enough.

I turned away, barefoot and unhurried, still glowing with everything Jordan left behind. The bathroom door closed gently behind Me—not slammed, not locked, just sealed with intention.



Part Five: The Ring

He was alone now.

In the room he had prepared but would never claim. Surrounded by scent. By tangled sheets. By the echo of something he would never be part of.

Still holding the linens. Still waiting for permission he knew wouldn’t come.

For a moment, he looked down at the bed—the mess he hadn’t made. The proof he wasn’t welcome in this part of My story.

Then he saw it.

On the nightstand.

Not a note. Not a keepsake.

His wedding ring.

Polished and gleaming, resting atop a pale pink Post-it with a single word written in My hand:

Watch.

He froze. Then lowered the sheets to the edge of the bed, folding them with care as if that might soften what came next. His fingers hovered above the ring, cautious. Almost reverent.

He picked it up.

Held it.

Let the metal rest in his palm like a verdict.

I had taken it from him weeks ago. Told him it no longer fit. That it didn’t suit the dynamic we were becoming. He hadn’t argued. Not with words. Just silence—the obedient kind that waits to be repurposed.

Now the ring was back.

Not to return what he lost, but to define what he was.

Watch wasn’t a gesture. It was a rule. A mark. A quiet, inescapable order that changed everything without raising My voice.

He slipped it on.

It still fit—perfectly.

And that was the moment he understood.

He wasn’t being pushed out.

He was being positioned.

Not as a husband. Not as a partner.

As a witness.

To My pleasure. To My choices. To the man I welcomed into My bed while he knelt on the other side of the door, listening, aching, forgotten by everyone except Me.

He would wear the ring again.

Because I said so.

Because it meant something now.

When I returned—fresh from the shower, skin warm, My pulse still slowed from control—he was exactly where I expected him.

Standing still.

Eyes fixed on the nightstand.

Fingertips grazing the edge of the Post-it like it might explain something.

Hard.

I didn’t acknowledge him.

Didn’t pause.

I walked past him slowly, and let the smile bloom only after I passed.",4,1747103240.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

1klawed,https://i.redd.it/mlez7k8gmg0f1.jpeg,Scaled Meal Prep + Complements,"Hi everyone! So I don’t do all of my meal prep all at once. Instead, I’ll typically do some significant prep a couple days a week, and the results will feed the freezer as well as set me up for that week. Case in point here! You’re seeing three days of breakfast with those strawberry overnight oat+chia pudding, at this point I eyeball the recipe and just try to track that I won’t abuse the quantities with my coffee serving spoon. For the rest of the week’s breakfasts, I will pull one of my homemade McMuffins, or today I warmed up a thawed bagel and ate it with cream cheese and avocado. 
In the weekend I made a batch of croquetas for a birthday party (recipe in Spanish but you can dump it on Google Translate: https://www.petitchef.es/recetas/entrante/croquetas-de-pollo-y-champinones-fid-1513294). Some of them went to the freezer, and that bag you’re seeing in my collage picture? There were two of them with the surplus chicken breasts I’d bought, shredded for future sandwiches, salads, bowls etc. Super easy: sear on the pan, then dump in a pot with broth, S&P and boil for some 15-20 mins. I will cut them in pieces and my string chopper takes care of the rest (amazing kitchen gadget omg). Which, speaking of gimmicks, get yourself a corn chucker. Mine arrived yesterday and the lone cob of corn I’d bought will now stretch for a couple salads/healthy meals this week, for instance with one of those marinaded beef bags you’re seeing. A large tray of 400 gr was on sale for $6.81 at my usual supermarket, so most of it went to the freezer. Marinades were just my choice of three spices (skewers blend, Cajun and ras-el-hanout) with lemon juice, salt, EVOO and for the ras one, yoghurt. They will do their thing when the meat thaws!
Now for the vegetable situation. I ordered one kg sweet snap peas and 500 gr asparagus for real cheap online ($3.95) and though they took some time to shell and prep, now they’re there! Along with some mint, onion, radish and bell pepper from last week, they made for some great veg stir fry that I paired with some lentil pappardelle I found in my dry pantry. Add taters with either chicken meatballs or (not pictured) salmon (both from previous meal prep in the freezer) and I am set for two meals! Salmon I marinated with fish masala and coconut milk, just eyeballed. Chicken meatballs recipe I took from some instagrammer, sorry! 
Dinners are always made at home fresh, but that doesn’t mean that there isn’t some thinking involved. Take that eel and the tuna, for instance. Both bought online in advance for $9.64; when my order arrived I wasn’t home and so in the evening I found that the eel and one of my tuna fillets were partially thawed. No biggie! Eel made for dinner yesterday with a bag of salad greens, and tuna will be prepped tonight in a cinch for another meal this week, while the other fillet stays in the freezer. What do I have there right now? Pesto…bolognese…some bread…butter chicken…all of what I mentioned above…roasted chicken with veg…and I am probably forgetting something. 
Congrats if you read all this haha. It’s a bit chaotic but here’s how I eat a wide variety of foods weekly, always having a backup in my fridge and without breaking the bank (I wouldn’t say “for cheap” because groceries just aren’t cheap, but the maths always beat eating out properly). This is all for one though my partner will sometimes sit to the table too. 💖 Hope it gives you some inspiration and feel free to ask!",4,1747103084.0,MealPrepSunday,0,1.0,False

1klav05,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1klav05/the_delivery/,The Delivery,"Here I write my recounts from over the last few weeks in as much clarity as I can muster in my anxious state, in hopes that my words will be found by another. In my desperation I only hope my recollection is accurate and true, and not just some fevered dream…

A bit over a week ago I found myself perusing a website, nothing special - mainly technology at a discounted price due to various reasons and imperfections. 
I found a peculiar item that drew my attention - a bone box with ornate trim. I know what you’re thinking; ‘What’s that got to do with technology?’
Really good question, and exactly the question that went through my mind as I looked through the listing photos that were attached.
The box piqued my curiosity, yet I had no idea what it was meant to be. It looked to be composed of two pieces of bone, with what I could only guess was pearl inlaid in a triangular pattern atop one of the halves. No angles gave clue to hinges or anything similar, and I figured that perhaps it was likely something akin to cranial sutures.

I can’t say exactly why, but I just had to have it. I like oddities and the such; and this was a piece that I would really like to add to my collection. 

As I made my way through the webpage I looked for as much information as possible, and I was left wanting in each step of the purchasing process… 
The item in question was only twenty dollars - cheap as, considering how unique its design was. A little off-putting, although only in hindsight. In the moment I found this more exciting than anything.
The seller had no information pertaining to who they were or where the item was located. Even more off-putting - an immediate red flag.
The seller in question had ‘only three remaining’, and at the time I figured that perhaps they had a few of these and each was slightly different in design. 
The final page before purchasing gave me a hearty chuckle, I’m not afraid to admit. It read as follows:

Tomorrow: FREE one-day delivery.
1-7 days: FREE Skinwalker delivery.

Initially I paused, confused, as to what it meant. After a quick search online, my afore mentioned hearty chuckle started - “A creature of Native American legend” was the search result. I laughed audibly for a few minutes I believe. The creature in question is an interesting read, and labelled as exactly that - legend.

I honestly don’t know what I expected when I selected the Skinwalker option: but who would select anything but when making an online purchase? Figuring it was nothing more than a hilarious joke, and that it would more-than-likely just be the exact same shipping option - that was the option I opted for with a cheesy grin and an overly excited click of the mouse.

Tuesday morning, I heard a knock at the door. Enthusiastically I answered the door with a cheery “Hello”, expecting my unique item to have arrived, only to find no one standing there. Looking up and down the street I couldn’t see anyone, just the usual few cars that lined the street and a neighbour’s cat that was staring at me from under one of said cars. 
Wondering if it was a knock and run, I turned back and walked inside. The likely-hood of a knock and run was minimal being a Tuesday morning. I remember thinking, ‘the kids were at school and the other adults were at work’. Having a weird roster has its perks - Tuesday and Wednesday off each week gives a better chance to get to any shops without having to fight time, although it can prove lonely with seemingly everyone else on a different rotation.

Walking back to my arm-chair, I took a seat and continued doom-scrolling inane crap as I tend to do. 

Maybe twenty minutes had passed, and I found myself laughing away to some reel or another. 
My ‘joy’ was interrupted by another rapping on my front door. Sitting my phone on my side table, I made my way to the door laughing most of the way.
I spoke through the door as I opened it, offering a meager apology to the delivery guy,
“ Hello. Sorry, mate, I was-” my apology was stopped midway as again I found an empty porch. This time I gingerly made my way down the few porch steps and examined both sides of my old house, then up and down the street, expecting to find a truant child perhaps, looking for a thrill while everyone else was at school. 

Nothing.

A long moment passed as I internally questioned whether I had actually heard the knocking… trying to consider things through multiple lenses, I came to the conclusion that the street was too still to have misinterpreted other noises as knocking, but had nothing else to fall back on.

I decided that I’d sit on the steps and wait for my mystery knocker to return for round three.

The next hour passed like a meandering turtle. Not a soul walked the street in that time and I found myself getting over the waiting game quite quickly. The only form of anything that could be considered close to entertaining was watching the neighbours cat sitting underneath the car and pondering what it’s life entailed. Even that grew stale quickly as the cat appeared interested in naught but staring at me. Maybe it was sitting there wondering what my life entailed, just as I wondered about its. 
As I stood to make my way inside once more, the only car to make it’s way down the street that I had seen or heard all morning turned into my street and slowly accelerated. I remember turning and paying attention to it, an old cream thing with soft lines. Perhaps vintage - although I wouldn’t know enough to know whether it could have actually been a vintage model or not. 
The warm sun shone down from the heavens and the immaculate car’s surface reflected the every ray of the sun’s light across my neighbours houses like a flashlight shining betwixt the panelling of a picket fence as it passed by. 
The hairs on my neck stood to attention as the car made it’s way past my house - the inexorable reflection danced across the cat and it’s eyes reflected the light back toward me, not the usual sickly yellow of a cat utilising the lowlight for visual advantage, but rather a vibrant red that felt as if it eyes bore into my very being.

The sudden shift gave me a start and I’m not too ashamed to admit I jumped just a little bit... I figure either the car passing or me jumping must have startled the cat as it was gone by the time the car had passed.

Holding my hand to my chest, I started to chuckle again with a bowed head before turning back inside with an embarrassed smile, softly shutting the door behind me.

Some time after lunch as I sat straddled upon the porcelain throne; reading news updates, checking the freshest memes - the usual time-fillers as I performed my daily ritual. I was drawn from my phone, however, by a sudden and sharp scratching from above me. My gaze diverted to the empty patch of ceiling above me immediately as I sat there motionless. 
“Rats?” I softly spoke to myself, puzzled. Although I don’t remember ever hearing the sound previous, that doesn’t exactly equate to no chance there’s a rat or rats now. Even though the sound only lasted a few seconds before stopping and not returning, it left me in a state that I can only describe as uncertain... like a state of anxiety I guess.

As I pulled my draws up, I heard the unmistakable knocking from my front door once more. 
Standing there with my pants halfway up, frozen, I contemplated not even answering the door and instead waiting for the ‘we missed you’ slip and just picking it up myself. 
An ingenious thought crossed my mind, if I do say so myself - exit through the back door and stealthily make my way around front to catch whoever was there. Ingenious.

As quietly as I could, I unlatched the deadbolt and gently opened the back door - no creaks to give my plans away. Poking my head out first, I meticulously scanned my back yard. No one - off to a solid start.
Softly closing the door behind me, each step forward made my pulse quicken. I suppose the unknown has a way of messing with us in ways, hence our fervent search for knowledge at each step of every turn.
Rounding the side of my house, I set sight on my side fence and I could feel my face become deadpan - my stealth mission was immediately hindered by the fence and accompanying gate that squeaked more than a church-mouse choir.

I’m still not entirely sure what made me think this was the best course of action, but I took a running start in an attempt to clear the fence in a graceful straddle. What ensued however, was polar opposite: my hip/guts hit the fence with a sickening thud, and I let out an ‘Oof’ sound with the wind driven from my body, I then tumbled over the fence to the front side with a second ‘Oof’ as the remaining wind was driven from my body upon forced contact with the ground.
“…Fuck…” my words were strained and probably through reflex more so than any practical thoughts. I don’t know how long I was laying there trying to gather myself before I remembered what I was even doing, getting up as quickly as my battered body would allow, I poked my head around the corner like a curious child.
Nothing.
Again, no one was anywhere near the vicinity. Although in hindsight, if someone was there, my full-body ballet would probably have sent the most battle-hardened fleeing in terror… probably not, but it helps my fractured ego a little bit after falling over my own fence and driving the wind from my body twice in a single bound…

With a limp I made my way to the street to see if anyone was around, partially to see if the potential culprit was anywhere to be seen, and partially to see if anyone saw my fence molest me with a suplex out the side of my house.

What did catch my attention however, was a patchwork weaving of sticks and bones that was affixed to my mailbox and lightly swinging in the breeze. I had never seen such a thing before in my life. 
Made from three sticks tied with some type of fibres, perhaps strands of hair, around the corners to form a triangle with three bones and an uncut stone suspended inside the arrangement by the same fibrous bindings.
I would be lying if I said I was anything but petrified in that moment, although I couldn’t have explained why at the time. 
Many minutes must have passed as I stood there staring at the precarious trinket attached to my mailbox. Eventually I mustered the courage to grab it, slowly. 
It was cold to the touch, abnormally cold, even before adding in the beaming sun’s rays to the equation. 
In a panic I ripped the unfathomable trinket from my belongings and tossed it haphazardly into the street with a sneer before quickly moving inside and bolting the door shut and sliding down the door, back pressed firmly, until I sat there pressed up against the barrier to the outside world. Curling my legs up to my chest I remained there, scared. Scared of what? I wouldn’t have been able to articulate the thoughts, even if given more than ample opportunity. All I knew was either something was really wrong, or someone was playing a prank on me worthy of a world record title.

Not a minute had passed when I was jerked from my racing thoughts by a loud knock imminently behind me. Moving to my feet with such a speed I wouldn’t have been surprised if I had torn myself from my skin and left it in a wet coil where I once sat.
I stood there, motionless, staring at the only obstacle between myself and the knocking.
“Wh- who-” my voice all but faded, I cleared my throat and tried again, “Who’s there? This isn’t funny, man.” Although as steady as I could hold, my voice wavered like slack fishing line in the wind.

Nothing.

I could feel tears welling in my eyes as I closed them, hoping against all that this would just stop. Just go away. 

Again the knocking came, this time louder, more forceful than before, then a soft woman’s voice followed,
“Is that you, Steven?” the voice was off-putting, at first I thought it was one of my neighbours, Mai, but her voice was… different. Like it didn’t have any pitch variation at all, just monotone and flat.
“Mai? Mai is that you?” I called through the door, abject terror parting momentarily.
“Is that you?” her voice still sounded weird, but it sounded like Mai nonetheless,
“Mai!” I exclaimed, unlocking and throwing the door open, “You won’t beli-” I started to speak with returning clarity before stopping dead. 
In the doorway did not stand Mai, but rather a small bone box inlaid with pearl rest on my doormat…
I remember an energy running the entirety of my body in that moment - an energy unlike any I had ever experienced previously. Every piece of me begun to shake and wobble violently - after some thought I’m likely to believe that perhaps my body was flooded with adrenaline or what-have-you and that was my bodies ‘fight or flight’ response kicking in. 
In a sick irony however, I felt utterly unable to do either, and instead stood there like a cow in the headlights. My legs gave way after what was probably closer to seconds but felt like an eternity as I collapsed to the floor, jarring me from the mental coffin I subconsciously found myself imprisoned in. 
Scurrying to my feet and slamming the door closed followed by the bolt and the regular lock in as quicker motion as I could muster, I then braced myself against the door, shoulder first, with my legs locked firmly behind me. 
Every breath came more rapid than the last and it felt as if my chest would burst at any moment as I could feel my hot breathe dispersed by the wooden barricade reflected back against my face.

Scratching from the walls broke my concentration on my front door, the source however, was an enigma - feeling as if the direction rotated with my perception in an attempt to confuse me, I stood motionless staring about the room in rising confusion.

All sense of normality had left my body: anxiety fueled my every thought and uncertainty gave rise to abject terror - something was horribly wrong, every ounce of my being screamed it at me, to run: run like my life depended on it.

Chicken-skin struck as the hairs on my neck stood on end at my sudden realisation: The back door! In my haste to see who was outside my front door, I had forgotten to secure the back door…

Creeping around as if I was walking on proverbial egg-shells, my pulse driving any other sensation from my ears, I rounded my head from the hallway and eyed the back door - both the wooden door and the gauss door swung open with reckless abandon. I still feel as if I could drop dead on the spot whenever I think back to that scene… the barricades to my abode had proven as useful as wrist-bands at an orgy, and I stood motionless for more than I care to remember, awaiting my life to end at any moment.

The sound of metal being ripped asunder spurned me from my motionless gaze, it had sounded as if it came from next door - “Mai!” I exclaimed, control returning to me in an instant. Perhaps Mai and I didn’t know each other very well, but her and Steven were very nice people, and if whatever plagued me on this day had set it’s sights on her: I had to try and help her in some way. I would want help if the shoes were reversed…

Stopping only to slide a butcher’s cleaver from the drawer, I bolted out the front door with startling efficiency - held only momentarily by my attempts at security. Amazingly I had the presence of mind to slide the butcher’s utensil into the side of my trousers before exiting my doorway. If anyone would have seen me sprinting next door wielding a large knife, the cops would have been here in an instant. I kind of wish I had now; at least law enforcement may have been there, and maybe they would have seen what I saw…

Only when I replay the events of that day in my mind do I recall seeing the strange bauble affixed to my letter-box once more, the same hideous bauble I flung away with disdain not twenty minutes prior. At the time I did not hesitate in my strides to take note of such things - although I wish more than anything that I had.

Exclaiming, “Mai!” I pounded on the door with inexorable fury, desperate for an answer and swimming in adrenaline - naught.
Finding it hard to believe that noone would have heard my thunderous knocks I took a step back and charged her front door shoulder-first.
The jam stood firm and I bounced like a pigeon on a windshield - and it fucking hurt. Momentarily I dropped my arm limp, agony aflush throughout my system - a welcome reprieve from an endless onslaught of panic.
Subduing the pain I repositioned myself and laid by boot into the door-lock with all my weight. Again and again I drove myself into the stationary obstacle that defied me. After the fourth or fifth kick the door-jam splintered and the door gave way, echoing the abrupt sound throughout the house.

A wave of cold air hit me harder than a prime-mover hitting a deer on the freeway. 

As if on auto-pilot I immediately flung myself inside without a moment’s thought, stopped only by my bodies sudden reaction to the climatic change. I felt every muscle start to tighten one after another, beginning in my legs, and each breath became enigmatically visible - how could the temperature shift from a warm, spring day outside to such a frigid and incompatible climate?  And seemingly as soon as one stepped over the threshold inside.

Immediately aware of the choices I had made, yet resolved to continue forward for Mai’s sake, I gingerly took my first step since regaining control over my bodily functions.

Initially, Mai’s house looked as I had expected it - bar lights off where one would have thought they would be on if someone was home. I called out to her again,
“Mai! Mai, are you home?! It’s Allan! Mai, are you okay?!”
Nothing… not a shred of sound emanated from within her house.
Determined to find Mai I continued forth warily.

The lounge room: everything was neat and tidy. A good sign to her wellbeing I had thought at the time, but honestly - my house hadn’t been ransacked and I was scared out of my mind. Any attempt at regaining my composure was swiftly met at the guillotine as I eyed a small white box on her coffee table - a box made of bone and inlaid in pearl. Any chance I had at feeling in that moment was dwarfed when the same sound of metal being torn asunder assailed my hearing - my eyes moved underfoot to the vibrating floorboards I stood upon. Whatever that sound was, it was coming from underfoot; from underneath the house.

All hope I had desperately clung to was ripped from me like a pacifier from a newborn as I turned tail only to be met face to face with Mai.

I think I almost shit myself when I turned and found her there, staring blankly at me. I can’t blame her - her neighbour had just broken into her house and as far as she may have been concerned: I was there only for nefarious reasons.

“I’m sorry, Mai, you didn’t answer your door and I was so worried-”

Mai didn’t flinch.

“I’ve had the weirdest fucking day and I was worried about you guys-”

In my embarrassed state I minced over my words in a futile attempt to get Mai to understand me, but she seemingly didn’t care for a word that came from my mouth.

“Mai? Mai, are you listening?”

Mai continued to stare at me, or more, seemed to stare through me. I took a laboured step toward Mai as I raised my hand to gently place on her shoulder, feeling she may have been experiencing similar to what I had, stating softly,
“Mai, where’d you get that box?..”
Her attention shifted as her eyes focused on mine, suddenly aware of my presence,
“I thought you were at work.” Mai spoke, more a combination of words strung together than a coherent sentence,
“Huh?” the question had caught me off-guard, “I don’t work Tuesdays or Wednesdays… Mai? Are you okay?”
“Steven? Is that you?”
Her words made my skin crawl… something about her demeanour was very off to the Mai I infrequently spoke to,
“Mai. We need to go. Now.” I grabbed her wrist as I started back toward her front door, immediately thrown by how cold her skin was, and how loose… the skin about her wrist twisted like it wasn’t actually attached underneath - not unlike that saggy, granny-skin grandmas tend to get under their necks and about their arms.
“What the-” I let go almost immediately and turned back to Mai, “You’re so cold, come, lets get you out of here…”

No sooner than I had uttered the sentence, did I feel a warm, sharp sensation light up my back like a flare in the night. Wincing and stumbling as I turned back to Mai, only then did I notice her eyes in the lowlight of the small room - dull black orbs that absorbed any rays of light shining through the broken doorway that would so much as grace her face. 
“Steven? I thought you were rats?” her voice changed when she spoke the word rats: it sounded wholly different. She sounded like me…

“Mai?-” I choked out as my feet fumbled with every reverse step, “Mai? Are you okay?..” my voice little more than a light rasp.

Her sunken gaze never let me, standing completely still as I inched my way from inside her house.

Only when I had exited her house in full did I turn to run, to be met by law enforcement with firearms drawn and concentrated on me,
“Freeze! Hands up and get on the ground!”
I hadn’t heard a sound other than Mai and my own heartbeat, and their timing leaves me with many questions in hindsight. Honestly in that moment I was glad, I was glad to be met by another human-being on the front lawn. I was even glad to be taken in the back of the Pig-Mobile - at least I wasn’t alone.

Everything from that moment onward seemed rushed, or perhaps passed me by in a flash. Doctors all say the latter due to trauma of some kind; hence my ‘near-instantaneous mental decline’.

I was arrested and charged with Break & Enter, Possession of a Deadly Weapon, Criminal Trespass, Menacing Behaviour and Criminal Mischief… my lawyer argued for insanity, against my wishes, and ultimately that’s what was decided - I was declared Guilty by reason of Insanity.

The Doctor’s won’t listen to a thing I’ve had to say and have declared that I would be a danger to myself if let free and unmedicated. No so much a danger that I’m not allowed a few comforts such as pencils and paper; but allegedly enough of a danger that I can’t see myself outside these walls any time soon.

The skittering noise in the roof started only a few days after my arrival, although noone else admits to hearing it - it’s here. It’s always here…

This morning I could hear soft mumbling from the other side of my cell. Pressing my ear against the soft, padded wall, I focused intently - genuine interactions with someone outside the orderly can prove few and far between. 
I could only make out the last few sentences,
“Allan! Allan, are you home?! It’s Allan! Allan, are you okay?! You’re so cold, come, lets get you out of here…”

1klauv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/asadsisters/comments/1klauv3/amandas_dangerous_lies/,Amanda's dangerous lies.,"Amanda's most recent post about only having pregnancy cravings for lemon water reminded me of something very important and very serious. 

Remember the ""suhoor wars"" between the sisters (and Marah) during Ramadan where every day, in every vlog, IG story, and TikTok post, they were all in competition with each other over who could eat the least for suhoor? They all started off by just having coffee, then just water and a date, then just water, and by the end of Ramadan they were all skipping suhoor entirely. 

Their comment sections were full of their naïve, ""fatty"" and ""oppressed Muslim girl"" followers who were telling the Asads how they wouldn't be able to survive their work/school day without eating a filling suhoor. Thus, the Asads got to feel like skinny white princesses who were better at calorie restriction than the ""sweaty Arabs"" they make their money from. 

But. 

We just found out from Amanda herself that she was pretending to fast all of Ramadan. She didn't fast a single day and was just putting on a show for her followers so that they wouldn't suspect anything. 

That means that every. single. time. Amanda got on social media and said ""youuu guiiiiiiiseeeeee, I'm just not hungryyyyyy for suhooooooor, I just want water otherwise I'll get bloaaaaaaated......you guyyyyyyyse, I just don't even want suhooor right nowwwwwwwwww"" she wasn't actually fasting. But all of the young girls who followed her believed that she was, and felt bad that they needed to have some eggs or a protein shake or something in the morning in order to be able to function at their job or study for tests at school. 

Meanwhile, lying snake Amanda was pretending to be oh so skinny and oh so ED that she didn't need suhoor, all the while she wasn't even fasting as she sat on her ass at home filming TikToks for a living.

One day I told her I loved her, but with such intensity that I even wrote to her. My best friend told me it was best to get this thing out that I was carrying.

1klass3,https://www.reddit.com/r/kollywood/comments/1klass3/why_are_tamil_tv_serials_stuck_in_such_a_creative/,Why are Tamil TV Serials Stuck in Such a Creative Rut?,"Need to ask something that's been rattling around my brain, possibly fueled by late nights and too much coffee while debugging code far from home.


When you look at Tamil TV serials these days, does anyone else feel like we're stuck in a time loop? It feels like 90% of them revolve around the same maamiyar-marumagal (mother-in-law vs daughter-in-law) conflicts, endless family conspiracies, and plotlines stretched thinner than a cheap dosa. Weeping levels are always at maximum, misunderstandings last for months, and villains twirl their metaphorical moustaches with zero subtlety.


Seriously, where did the creativity go? Compared to the experimentation happening in films (sometimes!) or even web series, the serial landscape often feels stagnant, churning out variations of the same theme decade after decade.


So, what's the actual deal here?


 * Is it purely a TRP game, sticking to 'safe' formulas that guarantee ratings from a specific demographic?


 * Is it lazy writing and risk-averse production houses?


 * Do audiences genuinely prefer these storylines, or is it just what they're constantly fed?


 * Are there any hidden gems or recent serials that actually tried something different and succeeded (or failed spectacularly)?


Genuinely curious to hear your thoughts, theories, frustrations, or even defences. Why does it feel like Tamil serials are creatively lagging behind?

Not like the semi thick cold one you get as add on to the cold latte that slowly mix in.

Was wondering would the Dreo Baristamaker be a good choice? 

Or what other choices are out there at around that price.

The other option I have read is the Vitamix with the aer disc but it would be much more as I don’t have the Vitamix.
