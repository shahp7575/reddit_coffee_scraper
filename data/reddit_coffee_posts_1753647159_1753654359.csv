I would also go for a coffee with friends every few months.

Then I lost everything I had and three loved ones very dear to me, I entered a major depressive episode like never before in all my life with psychotic depression and was unable to do the most simples things like bathe or do the dishes, I spent months trying to get off the bed and having constant panick attacks everyday before any activity.

I've been going to a psychiatrist and I'm much better now, I'm even able to work, but I'm living in the smallest country city with no classes around of friends to visit, I'm still not able to exercise and I've been trying to go back to drawing and to my old game for almost two years unsuccessfully, these activities became extremely annoying, tiresome, frustrating, something I loved and relaxed me irritates me now and I'm can't put into words how down I am with this, it's like I lost part of my identity with the drawings and I'm losing the whole game story I was so excited to see unfold for years.

Now all I do is sit around watching music related stuff on YouTube, listening to new music, I usually read a book when I'm outside home and spend too much of my time on Reddit when I'm home, and I've been forcing myself to watch things through streaming services too, and I'm hating this life, but I'm not being able to find anything I can do differently. I wonder if I'll ever be able to enjoy the activities I used to once I get into the right medication.

Anyway, what are your hobbies? I need some suggestions, what kind of stuff do you guys read? Which kind of content do you watch on YouTube? Which websites do you use? Is there anything else that I could do while I'm not that well that I'm missing?

1maz2ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1maz2ud/ocd_diagnosis/,OCD diagnosis,"Hello, a year ago a therapist told me he believes I have OCD - pure O. He said this cause I mentioned I had something silly in my head for ages - ""If I imagine I have a good time with someone over coffee, for example, I know it's a bad sign and won't come true. So I have to not think or imagine how a hang out will turn out because I know me thinking it will have the opposite effect""

I honestly thought it was a stupid thing that made me anxious. Once he mentioned OCD, I stalked this Reddit so much and I've realised... All the talking with close ones (reassurence seeking), my morality, my fear ""that I'm going insane for real this time"", my mental ""if I think X I will/won't Y so I have to avoid X""... 

I ran away from therapy, I wasn't ready to face OCD as a potential. But on Tuesday I have a psychiatrist appointment with the focus on exploring the option of OCD. I, of course, wanted to make a list of symptoms. But I'm so conflicted, I am scared my symptoms aren't severe enough or that I just have anxiety... I'm also scared that if it is OCD it's for life, am I always going to be draining to be around, will these doubts always be there since it is a lifelong struggle... Even though I've been to therapy before, this one scares me so deeply. 

Any tips for first sessions regarding OCD? Is life okay after getting officially diagnosed? Is this reassurance seeking???? I am lost right now, I am sorry. ",1,1753654169.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

She is 25 years old and I am 29. We started dating at the beginning of 2019 and broke up shortly into our relationship around October of the same year. We were never the best for each other at that time and I was already considering breaking up with her. I had planned to break up shortly after I got back from a international trip. Just before our breakup I went on a family trip to the Galapagos Islands. It was there that our problems boiled over and I kept getting called day after day to solve drama that was going on between her, my brother and his wife. While I was there in Galapagos I went out one night to a coffee shop/ club where I wanted to let loose, right in my journal, talk with locals and other travelers. Travelers. I ended up making friends with a woman and a man and had a long night just talking about different things that they had experienced and sharing my own experiences. The woman got really drunk and headed downstairs to the club and I followed shortly after. We weren't in there very long until she went to the restroom and some locals came out and got me because she had passed out on the bathroom floor and was obviously in need of help. The woman muttered to me through drunken ramblings on where she was staying and that she didn't want any medical help and to just walk her to her place. Although it took far too long, because of the drunkenness, I did end up getting her to her hotel. Hotel laid her in bed on her side, and slid her hotel key under the door. 
The next morning because I felt that me and my girlfriend were about to break up. I decided to brag to a family member of mine, my younger cousin, that I had slept with that woman the night before. Even though it did not happen. 
It was once I got back home that I broke things off with my girlfriend and tried to live out my life as normally as I could. I did have very hard feelings for her but I just couldn't deal with the emotional and mental stress that our relationship came with. Later on that year, little brother died in a drunk driving accident and it left me devastated. Because my girlfriend was a friend before so we got together. She showed up for me and supported me and showed me a different side of her that I truly came to love. In the next year we got back together and started going on adventures and made plans to get married. Then got married in 2023 and it wasn't until October of 2024 that we were able to afford a honeymoon. It was there that I told her that I had claimed to cheat while in Galapagos each day. I want to find a way to make her feel trustworthy of me again to prove that nothing happened that night and that I am deeply regretful of putting myself in that situation and bragging about something that didn't happen the day after. I know that I have hurt her and I will spend as much time as I can to make it up to her. I also feel that the past 6 years I have been honest and trustworthy and reliable that it feels like a stupid mistake like that shouldn't cause the death of our marriage. 
I have accepted my faults and taking accountability and shown her that I can be trusted, but it feels like she doesn't want to anymore. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1,1753654088.0,cheatingexposed,0,1.0,False

1mayz22,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1mayz22/matriculate_alone_at_45_years_exp_or_wait_for_55/,Matriculate alone at 4.5 years exp or wait for 5.5 years so partner can move with you?,"Probably a personal question, but its one I'm struggling to figure out right now. Could really use some insight and to hear some outside opinions. Currently live with my girlfriend and our dog and have been planning on applying R1 this cycle to matriculate in Fall 2026 with 4.5 years of experience, but now she is saying that she would absolutely not move next year as she just started a new job and needs to build some consistency on her resume. But would likely move in Fall of 2027 after being at her job for 2 years.

So my dilemma is if I should apply now, go alone and try to make long distance work, as well as figuring out what to do with the dog, apartment (she doesn't make enough to afford our current apartment), being living 8 hours apart, etc. Or if I should suck it up and wait a year to apply so we could move together. Might have greater odds for admission/scholarships by applying when I have 4.5 years experience instead of my current 3.5 years.

Pros of applying this cycle:

* Resume is in good shape to highlight my achievements at my current job, I don't think I will be able to make any resume-level impacts in the next year.
* If I was single I would prefer to get my MBA as soon as possible.
* Have already started writing essays, attending info sessions, and doing some current student coffee chats for the 3 schools I'm focusing on.
* Current admissions cycle appears to be on the less-competitive side due to political concerns for internationals (not really something I'm weighing heavily, but thought it might be worth noting).

Pros of applying next cycle:

* Could move with my gf and have support while attending. She would also love to be a part of the school's partners program. Would also make it easier logistically with our dog, apartment, etc. She also obviously highly prefers for me to wait a year, but wouldn't stop me from going this year.
* Might have better odds at scholarships since I'll have more work experience? Not sure if that's correlated.
* More time to save up money, pay off the remainder of my undergrad loans & what's left of vehicle loan, as well as continuing to contribute to retirement.
* More time to research more schools and apply to more, possibly 5 instead of the 3 I'm considering this year.

I guess a third option would be to apply this year at a few T15 schools and attend if I get scholarship, and if I get rejected apply next year. Or would it be possible to apply this year, get admitted with no scholarship, decline and apply again to the same school next cycle and shoot for scholarship?

1mayyd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mayyd3/i_wish_i_fought_harder_in_the_conversation_with/,I wish I fought harder in the conversation with my future in-laws,"need to get this off my chest because I don‚Äôt want my soon to be fianc√© to have to hear about it repeatedly.

I met up with his parents alongside him. For some reason they thought it was appropriate to allow his sister to also be there‚Ä¶ even though she has nothing to do with the situation.

They immediately complained saying that the coffee where we met sucked and then instead of going into the topic they act like everything is normal and talk to my boyfriend about school‚Ä¶

Eventually his dad finally starts us off. The whole point of the conversation was to solve whatever was going on with them and I wanted them to acknowledge they hurt me.

Instead, they stuck to their ‚Äúyou have a set negative perception of us and that‚Äôs the lens you funnel the information into,‚Äù which completely dismisses my ‚Äúhey this hurt me.‚Äù At one point his dad straight to called me controlling to my face and then later his mom called me codependent and accused me of answering for her son (first time I‚Äôm hearing this and I know for a fact that I don‚Äôt so it was just odd). There was a point when my boyfriend was trying to say something, his dad cut him off, and I politely asked ‚Äúcan you please let him finish, he has something to say‚Äù and instead of being cordial he escalated the situation. He goes off saying ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs MY son, I‚ÄôM HIS father!‚Äù And then just stared me down and then continued.

At one point his mom straight up lied saying she never said something I know she did (it had been on a phone call bf had on speaker in the car). They went on a whole sermon about how 70% of military marriage fail and how marriage is hard (bf plans going military) and basically told us to not get married just because they don‚Äôt like the thought of us marrying (why, I‚Äôm not sure).

We talked about my honors thesis about authoritarian parenting and his mom straight up said ‚ÄúI read the books/material you mentioned about the thesis. They‚Äôre not scriptural‚Äù as if that somehow devalues a literary analysis in an honors thesis draft in the world of academia where Christianity isn‚Äôt an aspect involved in the research‚Ä¶

His dad guilt tripped him about not giving them enough connection by saying ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want to be an absent father‚Äù when he goes military and it gets harder and straight up asked me if my dad was absent (he‚Äôs retired Marine)‚Ä¶ I found that extremely inappropriate. His mom was said something about how I‚Äôm going to suffer isolation as a military spouse and I was so taken aback. You only feel isolated if you don‚Äôt put yourself out there and find community.

They deny that they highly alluded to me being ungodly and demanding in an email. They deny that their response to things were out of proportion. They refuse to believe that I had good intentions for not including his mom in a Mother‚Äôs Day post even after we explained multiple times that she reacted negatively to a card I helped with in a private gesture so we didn‚Äôt think she would have wanted me to include her because of that reaction. I bet if I did include her, she would have still gotten upset because I wasn‚Äôt calling her like she wanted (I‚Äôve expressed I don‚Äôt like phone calls unless it‚Äôs my family or absolutely necessary multiple times. I‚Äôve never liked calls). I just wanted them to acknowledge that they hurt me and they couldn‚Äôt do that. I wanted an apology and they never did. Which is funny because his mom was like ‚Äúour kids hear us say I‚Äôm sorry all the time‚Äù and bf‚Äôs sister straight up scoffed and said ‚Äúwhen?‚Äù And her mom just laughed it off.

I never said I forgave them. I never said that I‚Äôd call them. All I said was ‚ÄúI feel better now that everything has been talked about.‚Äù The tension is lowered, but I still don‚Äôt trust them. I don‚Äôt feel like they genuinely care about how they treat me. They just move on without actually taking ownership of literally anything. They take everything negatively even when I‚Äôm trying to be neutral etc.

I‚Äôm so over it. My boyfriend agrees with my sentiments and agrees that they are being odd with everything. I may try to call or text once a month but I‚Äôm not gonna change what I‚Äôm comfortable with just because they demand something. They seem to want to be in control of how I behave and how bf and I conduct our relationship. They‚Äôre entitled to their opinion and they can have concerns but they don‚Äôt get to make me feel guilty because they aren‚Äôt getting what they want. They don‚Äôt get to be a major priority in my life right now when they‚Äôve made it clear they do not actually care about me.  Maybe I‚Äôm being too harsh, but they‚Äôve done absolutely nothing to redeem themselves.

I just wish that I would have fought back more. If I‚Äôm so demanding, I should have demanded that they acknowledge their impact on the situation. I should have walked out half way through because it didn‚Äôt really go anywhere.

He asked ‚Äúso are we good now?‚Äù And all I could manage was ‚ÄúI feel better about it.‚Äù I‚Äôm not promising them a single thing. They don‚Äôt get to be the center of our relationship.

1mayv5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mayv5k/aita_for_trying_to_rehome_my_neighbours_cat/,Aita for trying to rehome my neighbours cat?,"
I (live in unit 6) am part of a 6-apartment building in a low-income, high-crime area. It‚Äôs not the best neighborhood ‚Äî drugs, people on welfare, petty crime ‚Äî but our building is actually known for having the cleanest stairwell in the whole block. That‚Äôs only because we, the tenants, clean it ourselves. The cleaning company that‚Äôs supposed to come once a week (and charges us through our service fees) barely does anything ‚Äî if they even show up.

Now to the issue. The woman in apartment 1 ‚Äî let‚Äôs call her ‚ÄúF‚Äù ‚Äî is an alcoholic. When I moved in last year, she had just been found unconscious in the basement, lying in her own vomit, feces, and urine. One of the other tenants (M, from unit 5) found her after she‚Äôd been down there for a week. F was taken to rehab by her mother, and a forensic cleaning company had to come scrub her apartment because it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in months and the stench was indescribable. I still remember the smell coming from under that door. I also heard that before F moved in, an old woman had died in that same unit. That place has a history.

Anyway, after rehab, F got a cat ‚Äî a sweet little ragdoll-type with blue-green eyes called *L*. The cat was affectionate and honestly really lovely. But unfortunately, F relapsed without anyone of us really noticing.

A few months ago, we noticed something awful: literal footprints of shit coming out of F‚Äôs apartment and into the stairwell. I‚Äôm guessing the litter box hadn‚Äôt been changed in ages and the cat had no choice. I knocked ‚Äî no answer. I filed a complaint with the housing association ‚Äî no response. I even left a note on her door politely asking her to clean it up, especially since one of the tenants (J from unit 4) is old and bad on foot, and I had maintenance workers coming into my place to replace the boiler and ventilation system the next day ‚Äî they‚Äôd be walking right through that.

The note disappeared, but the shit footprints stayed. I attempted with another few not so nice written notes. But again she didnt came out. Eventually, I cleaned it up myself. I was furious ‚Äî one mop down the drain because there was no way i was going to throw that in my washing machine. While I was scrubbing the stairs, other neighbors stopped to say stuff like ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother, she should do this herself,‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs useless anyway, don't.‚Äù But I knew that if I didn‚Äôt clean it, the stench and bacteria would be in my home by the next day. So I did it.

M (unit 5) later heard from her son I what had happened and contacted the building supervisor directly ‚Äî she had his number by accident from a while back and made a formal complaint.

Things started deteriorating even further. The smell from her unit came back ‚Äî strong enough that the cat started escaping through the bathroom window and sitting out on the little roof above the entrance. Poor thing. Cats are clean animals. You can imagine how bad it must‚Äôve been in there for her to seek refuge outside. So M put some water and catfood at the windowsil where the cat seeks refuge. I can't take the cat because i have a bully xl who doesnt tolerate anything on four legs. 

Then last week, it got worse. I come home, walk up the first stairs ‚Äî piss. She pissed herself in front of her own door. Guess she didn‚Äôt make it to the toilet. The next day? Still there. Door mat soaking in a yellow puddle. I left another note. This time someone else ‚Äî M from unit 5 ‚Äî had left one too. Her tone was more diplomatic than mine.

Later that week, M ran into F and told her to clean it. F lied through her teeth, said she was going to buy cleaning supplies. Spoiler: she didn‚Äôt. The mat disappeared, but the drying piss puddle remains.

Meanwhile M has made this entire situation her life‚Äôs mission. She messages me nonstop with ‚Äúcat updates,‚Äù sometimes rings my doorbell 3x a day, even called me at 10:30PM on a weeknight to say the cat was on the roof again. I get it, but I do not care about it this much. I don‚Äôt want my day and thoughts getting consumed by a careless woman.

So I snapped ‚Äî quietly. I know I can be manipulative when I want to. I‚Äôm aware. And I figured: if the cat goes, F might go back to rehab. And we‚Äôll all breathe (literally and figuratively). So I told M: ‚ÄúLet the cat 'escape'. I‚Äôll find her a home. You can say you didn‚Äôt see anything.‚Äù

M agreed.

Sunday morning, M calls to say ‚Äúthe cat has escaped.‚Äù I ignore her ‚Äî coffee first. Meanwhile i'm thinking how or when did i get caught up in this life consuming drama? Why did i interfere? Was my life really becoming that quiet? Am i getting old? 
The cat‚Äôs under F‚Äôs balcony, dirty, scared, clearly not well. The local cat ladies show up (they care for all the strays in the neighborhood), and I hear them talking about the cat so I go down to explain. Turns out I could just pick her up ‚Äî she was trembling, her whiskers stuck together, fur matted. Poor baby.

I told the cat ladies my best friend would take her ‚Äî and she‚Äôd already offered months ago but i hadnt check back with her to make sure but i took the risk anyway. My friend has pets, experience, and a clean, stable home. But she wasn‚Äôt in town that day, so the plan was for the cat to stay outside just one more night.

M agreed. Then‚Ä¶ unfortunately‚Ä¶ F came outside and dragged the cat back in. Shit.. mission failed

And with her return came more shit. Literally. On the floor. In front of her door. Again. M was so done that she dumped half a bottle of bleach in front of F‚Äôs door. Right now there are four notes taped on F's door ‚Äî two from me (less than polite), one from M (also less than polite) and one from P (unit 3), more civil.

Just an hour ago we had a residents‚Äô meeting. Me, M, P, and J (unit 4). J is the kind of man ""a guy who knows a guy"". J knows someone in the housing association. This week, we‚Äôre writing a formal complaint and hand-delivering it.

So‚Ä¶ Reddit.

## Key Features Analysis

the market for 8 oz plastic cups is diverse, with products varying in terms of material composition, design, and features. Understanding these key characteristics is crucial for making a selection that aligns with your specific requirements and preferences.

**Material Composition:** Plastic cups are typically made from either polypropylene (PP) or polystyrene (PS). Polypropylene offers greater flexibility and impact resistance, making it less prone to cracking or shattering.Polystyrene, conversely, is a more rigid and brittle material, frequently enough used for cups intended for colder beverages. The choice of the plastic used directly affects the way the cup feels in your hand and how resilient it is indeed.

**Cup design:** The design of an 8 oz plastic cup extends beyond its basic cylindrical shape. Features like rolled rims, which offer a more comfortable drinking experience, and textured surfaces for enhanced grip, are important differentiating factors. Additionally, some cups may be designed with tapered profiles for easier stacking and dispensing, which can be particularly important in high-volume settings.The shape of the cup contributes to the overall aesthetic and how easily it is indeed handled.

**Clarity and Clarity:** The clarity of the plastic is an important consideration, especially when the cups are used to serve visually appealing beverages. High-clarity plastic cups showcase the colors and textures of the drink, adding to the user's overall enjoyment. Opaque or cloudy cups might potentially be more suitable for situations where appearance is less of a concern, such as serving water or other non-descript liquids.How clear the glass is affects how well the drink inside is displayed.

**Rim Construction:** The rim of a plastic cup is a crucial element influencing both comfort and functionality. A smooth, rolled rim enhances the drinking experience by eliminating sharp edges and providing a more secure seal against the lips. Reinforced rims also add structural integrity to the cup, reducing the likelihood of bending or collapsing when handled. The rim of the cup is what you are using to drink directly.

**Stackability:** For easy storage and distribution, the stackability of 8 oz plastic cups is a practical consideration.Cups designed with a slight taper and smooth surface allow for efficient nesting, minimizing the amount of space required for storage. This feature is particularly important for businesses and event organizers who need to manage large quantities of cups. They should be easy to store and easily accessible.

**disposable or Reusable:** While most 8 oz plastic cups are designed for single-use disposal, thicker and more durable versions might potentially be suitable for limited reuse. These sturdier cups can be washed and reused a few times, offering a more enduring option for users who want to reduce waste. However, it is important to note that plastic cups are not designed for prolonged or repeated use, as they can degrade over time and become challenging to clean effectively. Whether or not it is indeed reusable depends on the material the cup is made of.

1maynng,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1maynng/bonnie/,Bonnie,"# Entry One

I usually woke up before her to start the coffee maker, moving quietly in the dark as if that would soften my presence. I knew she was waiting for me to wake her, and I loved being the first part of her day.

We‚Äôd stand in the kitchen, the lights still off, watching the sun rise as we talked. Sometimes we spoke softly. Other times, it was about nothing in particular. We kept going until the last seconds before I had to leave for work. The thought of continuing those conversations carried me through the monotony of my day, all the way until I pulled back into the driveway. I‚Äôd switch off my headlights, just in case she‚Äôd fallen asleep on the couch waiting for me to come home. 

When I came through the door, she would greet me with a warm embrace and eventually offer dinner in a Tupperware container, making sure I ate. We would continue talking throughout the night, recapping our days, discussing friends, family, co-workers, and anything we had seen online recently. She always listened to me, and I did the same for her. At least, I hope I was as good a listener as she was. 

I never felt fulfilled in my job, and I often found myself drifting into stressful topics that led to moments of silent dismay. I tried not to let it bother me too much. I always wanted children with her, but I felt we needed to build up our savings a bit more first. Although our new house was small, I dreamed of adding an extension to create more space for a family, especially since we had enough land to make it possible. At times, I felt responsible for our challenges, as if she deserved better than the difficulties we faced.

To counter these feelings, I would put on her favorite childhood show, *The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh*. She would light up whenever we watched it, and its wholesomeness always cheered me up too. Many nights, we would fall asleep with it playing in the background, only to wake up and repeat our routine the next day.

One day, when I came home from work and opened the door, she was standing there with a look I recognized immediately.

Looking down at the floor, as if afraid I might say no, she asked, ‚ÄúCan we get a dog?‚Äù

As much as I wanted to say, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs going to walk it? And clean up after it?‚Äù I knew she had me, and I would do anything she wanted. She worked from home, and we didn‚Äôt have any pets. I had a feeling this was going to come up sooner or later.

The next couple of nights were spent researching breeds and local shelters, and it was so much fun. We reminisced about childhood pets, shared our fond memories with them, and discussed what we should be cautious of as we embarked on this venture. It felt like we were little kids who couldn‚Äôt sleep the night before Christmas.

We visited a few shelters, and it seemed like she was on the verge of tears because we couldn‚Äôt take home every animal we saw. Most of the dogs weren‚Äôt quite what we were looking for, but we kept searching. After visiting our third shelter, we found her. She was lying in her kennel with a polite, matter-of-fact demeanor, as if we were intruding on her tiny space. It was her home, even if it was small. She had a blue merle coat, and according to the kennel employee, she was a rough collie and Labrador mix, about a year and a half old. She immediately stood up to greet my wife when she offered her scent, gently licking her hand. She was so sweet. The only problem was that we were short on time due to prior plans. We had only intended to visit that day, and if we found a dog, we planned to arrange the adoption for the weekend.

But this was different. Despite all our research, we decided to take a chance, canceled our plans, and brought her home. When we pulled into the driveway and parked, she was hesitant to leave her kennel. We had to carry it into our little living room, open the door, and eventually, she cautiously made her way out into the kitchen, where my wife had placed a small bowl of food for her. By the end of the night, she was lying on the floor of our bedroom upstairs. She felt safe with us, and we felt safe with her.

The next day was a Friday, and fortunately for both of us, we had the day off. The morning started out normally, except I had a little helper who made sure my once-silent routine was now loudly observed. I took her out into our large yard, and I had never seen anything happier. She had so much space to explore and looked so curious and free. Every plant and bug was a new discovery as we soaked in the cool late-summer morning. Once she had finished her business, the late riser was waiting for us in the kitchen with her coffee. Our new guest felt much more comfortable, and we were both excited to welcome her into our lives.

After a short game of fetch, my wife grabbed the car keys and excitedly said she wanted to run out to get some treats and a couple more toys. I laughed and took on the babysitter role as she waved to us while backing down the driveway.

An hour passed, and I began to feel a little concerned, but I figured she might have stopped to pick up breakfast. After two hours had gone by with no word from her, I had already called and texted. When three or four hours had passed, I was calling her every minute. The calls went straight to voicemail. As the sun began to set, I sat on the front porch, staring down the driveway, waiting for any sign of headlights. I called my sister, but she lived an hour away and had to work. She told me she would come by as soon as she got off. Our little guest was just happy to be able to run around and get some attention, which greatly helped in the midst of our growing concern.

When I first saw the headlights coming down our driveway, I shot up and jumped down the steps. I had never felt such a rush of relief. The weight of fear had been like a barbell strapped to my back, impossible to lift.

But as the car turned, I noticed the lights on top. It was black and white, and a surge of anger and embarrassment flooded me. The back of my neck burned white-hot. I couldn‚Äôt comprehend why this was happening. All she had done was go to the store.

Two state troopers pulled up next to me, their car coming to a quiet stop. They stepped out in unison, their movements precise and deliberate. The passenger-side trooper didn‚Äôt say a word as he approached. Gently, he placed an arm around my shoulders, steadying me as I knelt in the yard. His voice was soft, almost a whisper, as he asked, ‚ÄúCan we go inside?‚Äù

I still remember the faint glint of their name tags catching the light, momentarily piercing through my hollow stare. One read Murphy, the other Lancaster.

As she was merging onto a highway, a drunk driver, speeding and switching lanes recklessly, hit her. The impact knocked her off the shoulder of the road and into a tree. She died on impact.

My sister arrived at the house shortly after. One of the troopers gently took her outside to break the news, while the other stayed with me in the front room. They remained until she could compose herself, then left their contact information with her before returning to their duties.

Meanwhile, I hadn‚Äôt moved from the chair in the living room. I couldn‚Äôt move, and I didn‚Äôt want to. My sister draped a blanket around me and refused to leave my side. I wept and occasionally vomited into a bucket she had placed next to me. I neither ate nor slept that night. My sister lit candles in the living room, surrounding me in their glow, and tried to coax our little friend out from her hiding spot under our bed upstairs to feed her.

I still remember the darkness of that night. It should have poured rain, but instead, it was a warm, still evening. The silence was suffocating. The candles‚Äô flames danced in my eyes whenever I chose to open them. The only sound came from my sister, who had fallen asleep on the couch next to me. Her somber snoring broke the stillness, a stark contrast to the silent despair that kept me wide awake.

As the sun began to rise, casting a gentle light through the windows like a tranquil alarm, fatigue finally began to overtake me. My heavy eyes started to close, pulling me into what felt like a new nightmare. But then, I felt a wet sensation on my hand, which hung limply over the arm of the chair.

I sat up slightly, rubbed the gunk from my eyes, and leaned over to see our little guest. And it all started over again. It wasn‚Äôt the weeping of loss this time, but the ache of what could have been and what would always stay with me. She had her tennis ball with her, and it felt as though she was saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I chose her name. I wanted her to share in the love I had for the one person I had always wanted to spend every second with. That‚Äôs when I named her Bonnie.

# Entry Two

My mornings were no longer silent. Bonnie had grown accustomed to being fed at a specific time, and she made sure I knew it. It felt like she practically dragged me out of bed and into the kitchen. My once quiet, careful morning routine had turned into a depressing shuffle to serve her beloved breakfast, always followed by a little conversation between us. Sometimes, it feels like she knows she's the reason I get up each morning, keeping me going when I otherwise wouldn't.

Our morning walks around the property have become the only reason I leave the house. After my workplace found out what happened, they put me on leave to sort things out. It was a kind gesture, but honestly, I don't have any desire to go back. Everything I did for that job was for a greater purpose, and now that purpose is gone. I'll find something different when the time comes.

My sister calls frequently and visits often, usually staying more than one night. Her presence has become familiar, and it shows with Bonnie. She joins us on our walks, which is refreshing, even if it doesn't fix everything. I know she cares, but I also know nothing can really make it better.

When she stays over, she usually gets up before me to give me a little more time to stay in bed. She tends to overfeed Bonnie and play with her in a patronizing way. I can tell Bonnie isn't a fan, but I suppose the company is appreciated. Still, every night I see ghosts, and I can't shake the feeling of hearing her voice calling for me down the hall. It taunts me, reminding me of a wound that will never heal.

One evening, after dinner, I took Bonnie for her usual walk. Normally, we stay within view of the house, but I decided to go a little farther into the woods. I figured it couldn‚Äôt hurt as long as I remembered the way back. Bonnie led the way, per usual, and we made our way through some tall grass onto a rough dirt path shaded by the tree line. We heard a rustling sound nearby, and I assumed it was a squirrel or a rabbit. The silence that followed was deafening, but when the crickets started chirping again, we continued onward. The shadows cast by the trees made me think about returning during the day to escape the heat and harsh sunlight.

As we moved deeper, the rustling returned, this time closer. Bonnie stopped, and so did I. She sensed something was nearby but didn‚Äôt bark. Instead, she backed up toward me, her tail brushing against my legs. The crickets resumed, but Bonnie stayed still.

A coyote burst out of the bushes, startling both of us. Bonnie barked but didn‚Äôt advance. The coyote stood its ground, glaring at us, even taking a few steps forward. Fear crept in. What if there were more? What if they went after Bonnie? I quickly leashed her and retreated back towards the house.

Once we got home, I felt a little embarrassed by the encounter, though I‚Äôm not sure why. Bonnie seemed fine, so to lift her spirits, I decided to play with her for a while. She always told me that fetch was her favorite game, though she‚Äôs shown me a few others. I knew we had to get some playtime in before my sister came and insisted we go to bed. I hate when she gets in between us.

# Entry Three

My sister has pretty much made herself at home, settling into our old living room. I guess it‚Äôs fine, but every time I get a moment alone with Bonnie, our time is interrupted by a phone call. Of course, it‚Äôs always her. She usually comes over on Wednesdays and stays until Sunday morning. Having someone around can be nice, but I can tell Bonnie‚Äôs starting to get tired of her, and honestly, so am I. She‚Äôs just always there. And while I‚Äôm grateful for her help, I‚Äôm also looking forward to the moment she finally gives me some space.

I‚Äôve connected with Bonnie in a way my sister wouldn‚Äôt understand. I don‚Äôt think she needs to be here all the time. I‚Äôm doing a little better, but my sister keeps insisting something‚Äôs still wrong. She always says, *""I just don‚Äôt want anything else to happen, as long as I can help it.""* Everything is fine. The fact that she doesn‚Äôt believe me only makes me more upset. I‚Äôm tired of being treated like a child.

Our morning walks have become my only escape from her constant presence. I still think about returning to that shaded area in the woods where the trees block out the light, but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm ready yet. My sister usually watches us from the kitchen window. I can always feel her there, lingering like a shadow. Still, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm getting out of bed more often than before.

Recently, after one of our morning walks, my sister excitedly told me about a local dog park she wanted to take me to. I wasn‚Äôt thrilled about the idea. I don‚Äôt trust other people‚Äôs dogs around Bonnie, but she was insistent. She really wanted me to leave the house. It‚Äôs been a while since I have, and she‚Äôs been the one bringing in groceries while I spend most nights lost in thought.

Apparently, my reluctance was obvious, because she gave me an ultimatum: if I went to the dog park, she‚Äôd leave me alone for the rest of the week, at least until Sunday. If I didn‚Äôt, she‚Äôd come back on Thursday. I knew she was trying to be considerate, so I figured, why not?

It was a short drive across town. I sat next to Bonnie in the back seat, trying to keep her calm because of my sister‚Äôs erratic driving. I could tell she was stressed, but I knew this wouldn‚Äôt take long, and we could get back to our routine.

We pulled into a small parking lot next to the dog park. It wasn‚Äôt too bad. It was small, but luckily not crowded. I kept Bonnie leashed; I didn‚Äôt want her getting too close to anyone‚Äôs dog. Most people were leaning against the fence near the parking lot, barely paying attention to their dogs, while a few were playing in a small area. My sister rubbed my back, making me jump. She offered to walk Bonnie, but I refused to give up the leash.

A bright yellow tennis ball landed at my feet, and just as I reached down to pick it up, Bonnie grabbed it. I laughed and tried to take it from her mouth when I noticed a pretty Saluki dog standing in front of us, curiously sniffing Bonnie. They exchanged sniffs under my watchful eye, and I kept a firm grip on the leash, ready to pull Bonnie away if anything went wrong. Just then, someone called out,

*""Winnie!""*

When I looked up, I froze. A woman with shoulder-length strawberry-blonde hair was walking toward us. She wore round, wire-frame glasses, and her bright blue eyes met mine as she smiled. Her cheeks flushed slightly, and she brushed her hair back before pointing at the leash.

*""You don‚Äôt have to leash them inside the gates,""* she said. *""I understand though! You never know how these things will go. What‚Äôs her name?""*

I could hardly speak, but luckily, my sister chimed in. She told her Bonnie‚Äôs name and complimented her dog for being ‚Äúcute and fluffy.‚Äù Then, doing me a favor, she said she had left something in the car, adding, *‚ÄúTake care of my brother while I‚Äôm gone.‚Äù*

Her name was Amy, and she worked as a dental assistant in town. She had a special fondness for long walks with her dog, whose name was inspired by a favorite childhood character.

Before I knew it, I found out she was free this Saturday. I don‚Äôt know why, but I‚Äôm excited, even though I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be. When I told my sister, she almost jumped out of the driver‚Äôs seat in excitement. She even promised to babysit Bonnie. I just hope she treats Bonnie well while I‚Äôm gone.

# Entry Four

When I finally had some time to myself, I started to think more about what I had gotten myself into. I‚Äôm not ready to go on a date with anyone right now. I just thought it would be nice to spend time with someone besides my sister for a change.

I haven‚Äôt been this nervous in a long time, and I wasn‚Äôt sure I was ready for something like this. It felt too soon. I figured I‚Äôd let a few days pass and maybe come up with an excuse to get out of it.

Even after some time, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that what I was doing was wrong. I still felt like I was making a mistake. I didn‚Äôt know what to do until my sister called me on Wednesday. As much as she annoys me sometimes, she knows how to calm me down. She reminded me that this didn‚Äôt have to be anything serious if I didn‚Äôt want it to be, and I shouldn‚Äôt feel bad about being attracted to someone. She even extended the time before she‚Äôd check in on me again, which made me feel better. Honestly, I just wanted to get through it and return to spending time with Bonnie.

As the week went on, I just felt worse. I almost came up with an excuse, like pretending I was sick or saying something came up with my family, but I knew if I went through with it, it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, and I‚Äôd finally get the space I needed. I checked in with Amy the day before, and she seemed excited. Up until then, our communication had been light, just a few funny exchanges about dog memes.

I barely slept the night before, but not for the usual reasons. My sister came over a couple of hours early, and I guess she helped lift my mood a little. It felt like I was gearing up for something big, like I was supposed to win some kind of race.

She helped with the dishes while I got dressed. Bonnie helped me pick out a nice shirt, which gave me a little confidence. I could feel her cheering me on. But the guilt hit me hard when I realized I was about to leave her behind. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that my sister wouldn‚Äôt take good care of her. I should have just come up with an excuse.

When it was time to leave, it felt like I was saying goodbye for good. I backed out of the driveway, waving to my sister and Bonnie. I could see the sadness in Bonnie‚Äôs eyes. She didn‚Äôt even come to the car. I kept telling myself it would all be over soon.

Amy and I had agreed to meet at a coffee shop and then take a walk in a nearby park. Before I had decided to have a fit, it seemed like a good idea to get to know her better. Now, I regretted it. Still, I felt the need to show up early so I wouldn‚Äôt keep her waiting. It seemed like the right thing to do.

I found a table in the corner, feeling out of place as other people worked on their laptops or met with friends. It was the waiting that was the hardest part, like I was an outsider looking in. The quiet hum of conversations around me broke when she finally walked through the door.

She was dressed nicely, with her makeup done and her hair styled. Instinctively, I sat up straighter and checked my breath. I don‚Äôt know why I hadn‚Äôt eaten anything yet. She spotted me and came over for an awkward side-hug before sitting down. I offered to get her a drink while she got settled. She politely declined at first, but I insisted.

She asked for a cappuccino, and since I only drink coffee at home, I panicked and ordered the same thing. I admitted I didn‚Äôt know much about coffee, and she laughed. We talked about small things: where we went to school, childhood interests, favorite movies or shows.

It felt good to have a normal conversation, even though I hadn‚Äôt really watched much since everything happened with Bonnie. Amy told me she got Winnie during a tough time in her life too. I didn‚Äôt go into detail about what happened to me. I just called it a ‚Äútough time.‚Äù But when I mentioned how important Bonnie was to me, I started choking up. I excused myself to the bathroom, but I‚Äôm pretty sure she noticed.

When I came back, she placed her hand on mine and said, ‚ÄúPets are family, but they always feel like good friends at first.‚Äù I nodded, but the words didn‚Äôt land the way she probably intended. It was a sweet thing to say, I guess, but it felt shallow. I don‚Äôt think she realized how much Bonnie means to me. Her comment felt rehearsed, like she was trying to say the right thing instead of actually understanding.

We kept talking about Bonnie and Winnie. She shared her favorite games to play with Winnie, and I mentioned a few of mine. But she didn‚Äôt seem all that interested. Her eyes kept drifting, and every now and then, I‚Äôd catch a strange expression on her face, like something I said didn‚Äôt quite sit right or like she was trying to puzzle something out. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was doing wrong. I thought I was being normal. I listened when she talked. I laughed when I was supposed to. I thought the things I shared made sense. The way she looked at me, though, made me feel like maybe they didn‚Äôt.

She quickly changed the subject to the weather, and we decided to head to the park for a walk. It was a beautiful fall afternoon, golden leaves, bright sunshine, and a gentle breeze. The summer humidity was gone, making the day feel perfect. I was even more excited because I knew I was closer to going home to Bonnie.

As we walked, Amy talked about how fascinating she found the connection between dogs and humans. She thought it was strange how dogs follow and rely on humans through a leader-follower relationship. In the wild, there isn‚Äôt an alpha dog. They hunt and live in packs as a family unit.

That idea stuck with me. I told her how I used to really want a family, how important it was to me at one point. It felt like something I had held close but then lost. I wasn‚Äôt sure anymore if it was something I still wanted.

We walked around the park a couple of times, sharing funny family stories and laughing together. Time slipped by, and before I knew it, the sun was setting. I felt like I was almost at the finish line. She mentioned needing to check on Winnie and said she‚Äôd text me later. We said our goodbyes, and I walked to my car, feeling lighter.

On the drive home, I could feel the pressure on the accelerator. I couldn‚Äôt wait to see Bonnie and tell my sister how it went. As soon as I pulled up, Bonnie ran out to greet me saying, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt leave again!‚Äù I told my sister about the date, and she hugged me so tightly it felt like she was squeezing all the tension out of me. She said she was proud of me, but had to head home soon, though Bonnie still needed to go out. In that moment, I couldn‚Äôt have been happier.

I grabbed Bonnie‚Äôs leash, and we waved goodbye from the porch as we rounded the house, heading toward the field where the trees covered the sky. I felt unstoppable. It was a full moon that night, and I wanted to see the moonlight spill through the canopy as we listened to the crickets and watched the fireflies flicker in the dark.

But when we reached the tree-covered area, the crickets had fallen silent, and the fireflies seemed too shy to show themselves. It was a bit disappointing. I hadn‚Äôt expected much, but I had hoped for more. The night was still beautiful, though. Clouds had rolled in, making it darker than I had imagined.

As we stood there, I felt a strange silence settle over us. It felt familiar in a way I couldn‚Äôt quite place. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and a sense of discomfort filled the air. There was this unshakable feeling of danger, like something was watching us.

Bonnie‚Äôs fur bristled, and she positioned herself in front of me, feet wide apart, alert and protective. I sensed something too, and just like before, the bushes across from us rustled. This time, a coyote burst out, but not in the cautious way it had before. It leapt at us with aggression, baring its fangs. Bonnie, usually so brave, tucked her tail and retreated behind me.

Without thinking, I scooped her up, adrenaline fueling my strength, and ran back toward the house as fast as I could, fear propelling me forward.

When we got back to the house, Bonnie hid under the kitchen table for most of the night, and when I went to sleep, she stayed underneath the bed. I was humiliated. I don‚Äôt know why I thought anything good could have come from going back there. I don‚Äôt know why I couldn‚Äôt have protected her when it counted. I know that I will never allow that to happen again. I know that I have learned what was needed to protect our family.

# Entry Five

Good morning, Dr. Meier,

It has been quite some time since we last spoke, and I wanted to reach out to express my concerns about my brother, Nick. I deeply respect the importance of client confidentiality in supporting his healing, but I am genuinely worried about his well-being.

After Nick lost Bonnie, I may have been too involved in trying to support him. It felt strange when he named their newly adopted dog ""Bonnie"" so soon after her passing. I understood his desire to preserve her memory, but it seemed like an unfair burden to place on another animal that couldn‚Äôt understand its significance.

I gently suggested other names, but Nick was adamant about naming her Bonnie. At first, it seemed to help him cope, especially during times when I couldn‚Äôt be there. Knowing that this new Bonnie gave him a reason to get outside offered some reassurance, as I feared he might otherwise retreat entirely.

I know I can be pushy, but I felt compelled to encourage him to leave the house and stay active. I worried about him isolating himself and feared the worst. I just wanted to help him in any way I could.

When Nick met Amy, I was thrilled. Seeing him connect with someone on a personal level gave me hope. It was a relief to know he had someone else besides me to lean on.

Eventually, I started giving him more space. It was clear he didn‚Äôt want me at his place as often, so I backed off. Even so, I kept calling and texting regularly to check in. When I got no response for a while, I decided to reach out to Amy directly. I found her on Facebook and sent her a message, unsure if she would even respond. She eventually got back to me after a few days. She said the date with Nick went fine overall, but admitted he seemed a bit off-putting toward the end of the evening. She described his behavior as strange and mentioned that his energy felt heavy and hard to read. Amy also said that after the date, he stopped responding to her entirely. She seemed hesitant to say more and kept the exchange brief, which made me wonder if there was more she wasn‚Äôt comfortable sharing.

However, I‚Äôve grown increasingly worried about his attachment to the new Bonnie. He seems overly protective of her and dislikes when I interact with her in ways he doesn‚Äôt approve of, which happens often. He claims to know her ‚Äúfavorite games‚Äù but never explains them. I‚Äôve overheard him having long, detailed conversations with her, but he goes silent the moment he realizes I‚Äôm nearby. It often feels like he‚Äôs discussing something about me with her.

Not long ago, I witnessed something that deeply unsettled me. Through the kitchen window, I saw him walking Bonnie. He let her off the leash, then sat down on the ground in a posture that mimicked a dog. Without warning, he sprinted across the yard on all fours, chasing her. As strange as it sounds, he was surprisingly fast and almost caught up to her.

A few days later, I went to visit him in person, and something felt very off. Normally, he greets me at the front porch, but this time he didn‚Äôt. I waited, then checked the front door, which was unlocked. Inside, the house was in disarray. It was uncleaned and foul-smelling, like urine. After calling for him multiple times, he entered through the front door with Bonnie following. Her fur was unkempt, and she desperately needed a bath. Nick looked similarly disheveled. His clothes were dirty, and he clearly hadn‚Äôt shaved in some time.

I tried to talk to him, but he ignored me, focusing on feeding Bonnie by pouring food directly on the floor. I attempted to clean up a bit, preparing to mop the floors at least, but he angrily dumped the bucket of water outside and said Bonnie would get upset if I cleaned. He told me to leave it alone, so I played along, sensing he wasn‚Äôt in the right state of mind.

We sat in the living room. I took the seemingly unstained ottoman, and he sat in a filthy chair. I tried making conversation, hoping he‚Äôd share something about what was going on, but he wouldn‚Äôt budge. He eventually told me he didn‚Äôt need me checking on him anymore. He said he was fine and didn‚Äôt need ‚Äúbabysitting.‚Äù

His dismissal upset me, and I admit I reacted emotionally. I demanded to know what was going on and told him I couldn‚Äôt bear to lose him after already losing a sister-in-law. That‚Äôs when he erupted. He started yelling and clenching his fists. It scared me, even though I knew he wouldn‚Äôt hurt me. I had seen him like this before, but something about this moment felt different. The way he spoke, from his tone to his rhythm, was unsettling. It felt as if he wasn‚Äôt entirely himself.

When Nick stood up to leave the room, I hoped he might calm down. Instead, Bonnie began barking, mirroring his agitation. She bared her teeth and, without warning, lunged at me.

Nick grabbed her just in time and made it clear that I needed to leave immediately. I don‚Äôt want to get my brother or Bonnie into trouble, but I believe it‚Äôs time to reach out to him and encourage him to speak with you. Please let me know if you hear from him.

Thank you, 

Millie Robertson

# Entry Six

Good Morning,

As part of Mr. Nicholas Robertson‚Äôs treatment protocol, he is required to submit periodic journal entries for clinical review. His most recent submission has raised significant concern.

Over the past several weeks, I have reached out to Mr. Robertson numerous times by phone, email, and text message, and have left multiple voicemails with no response. After this extended silence, he finally replied, but not with a direct message. Instead, he submitted the journal entry you are about to read.

While I will refrain from interpreting or editorializing the content, I believe the tone and language speak for themselves. There has been a stark and abrupt shift in his emotional and psychological presentation.

I cannot say with certainty whether what he has written reflects reality, delusion, or a combination of both. However, given the intensity of the language and the apparent mental state behind it, I believe a welfare check is necessary and should be conducted without delay.

Please review carefully and ensure the entry is included in any documentation made available to first responders or investigators.

Thank you,

Dr. Evelyn Meier

we are the pack now.

# Entry Seven

**Martinsburgh Police Department Report**  
**Case Number:** 078221  
**Date:** 11/17/2026

On November 14th, 2025, at approximately 1530 hours, I was dispatched to (STREET ADDRESS REDACTED FOR PRIVACY) for a welfare check on the occupant, Nicholas ROBERTSON. Upon arrival, OFC LANCASTER and I met with Millie L. ROBERTSON, who was waiting for us outside the residence.

We spoke with Ms. ROBERTSON briefly to understand the situation involving Mr. ROBERTSON. After our conversation, we approached the front door of the residence. Attempting to look through the windows on the front porch proved ineffective due to heavy dirt and grime obscuring the glass.

We knocked on the door, announcing our presence, but received no response. Ms. ROBERTSON attempted to open the door, which was unlocked. As she did, we heard a disturbance around the side of the house. Moments later, approximately twenty dogs came running into view. The dogs were barking aggressively and behaving erratically. OFC LANCASTER and I retreated from the porch to call for backup and animal control.

The dogs would occasionally rush toward us, nipping at our hands and legs. Several bites were hard enough to break the skin. What struck me as unusual was the inconsistency in force. Some bit down with significant pressure, while others seemed to hold back, as if they were capable of more but were intentionally restraining themselves.

Once backup officers arrived, efforts were made to distract and corral the dogs, allowing us to safely re-approach the house. Upon opening the front door, we were met by an additional dozen dogs rushing out of the home. The scene inside was chaotic and unsanitary. Dried dirt and feces covered the walls and floors. Several indistinguishable animal carcasses, some fresh and others in advanced stages of decay, were scattered throughout the residence. The home appeared to be in complete disrepair.

Ms. ROBERTSON became visibly distressed and began calling out for her brother while moving through the house. Despite our efforts to keep her outside for her own safety, she insisted on continuing the search. She eventually ran upstairs, and we followed in order to remove her from the premises for further investigation.

The upstairs bedroom was in slightly better condition than the rest of the house. While securing the area and escorting Ms. ROBERTSON out, OFC LANCASTER observed a large, torn-apart box on the bedroom floor. Printed clearly on the side was the name ‚ÄúNovatek.‚Äù

Once the scene had been stabilized and Ms. ROBERTSON was safely outside, OFC LANCASTER used his department-issued device to conduct a brief search on the name. ‚ÄúNovatek‚Äù led to an article describing a Japanese company known for producing hyper-realistic animal costumes. One case in particular involved a custom-made dog suit commissioned for personal use.

The photos accompanying the article showed a costume that, at a distance, appeared convincingly lifelike. However, the eyes of the suit were described and shown as vacant and hollow in appearance, lacking the natural focus or motion of a living creature. The overall effect was deeply unsettling. While the suit could pass as real in motion or peripheral vision, the eyes served as a clear and ominous giveaway.

It was at this moment we realized that one of the dogs on the premises was likely Mr. ROBERTSON.

OFC LANCASTER and I quickly exited the home and returned to the front yard, where most of the dogs had already escaped containment. They were seen running across the open field behind the house and into a distant tree line. Among the fleeing dogs, one stopped momentarily, stood upright on its hind legs, and then disappeared into the forest.

# Epilogue

Hello Dr. Meier,

I‚Äôve tried reaching out to you through calls and texts as much as I could after everything that happened. First, I want to sincerely apologize for the media fallout following the investigation into my brother‚Äôs home. We‚Äôre doing our best to restore the property and eventually put it on the market, though it seems like it will be a long time before anyone feels comfortable purchasing it.

That said, I would feel a lot better if I could hear from you. I understand if you‚Äôve been avoiding my attempts to get in touch. Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt blame you. I feel responsible for so much of this and just want to find a way to make things right.

There‚Äôs something I need to bring to your attention as well. When I searched my brother‚Äôs house the day he disappeared, I found an address written on a piece of paper taped to his old refrigerator. When I looked it up, I discovered it was tied to your name. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs an old or temporary residence. I don‚Äôt believe my brother has any reason to seek you out, or at least I haven‚Äôt seen any signs of hostility toward you. Still, if you‚Äôve experienced anything unusual, please let me know as soon as you can.

I‚Äôve also heard unsettling reports from friends about hunters being attacked by wild dogs in the woods. One story mentioned a creature moving so quickly and violently that it didn‚Äôt seem like anything they‚Äôd ever seen. I‚Äôm hoping these are just exaggerated tales. Even so, I hear howling in the woods around my home. Some nights, it feels louder and closer, almost like it‚Äôs calling out to me. Or maybe it‚Äôs coming for me. Either way, I know there‚Äôs no place for me there anymore.

Please take care,

Why sparkling water is so healthy?  
To make water carbonated, carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) is added to it. As a result, a weak carbonic acid is formed, which gives the water a slight sourness.  
Many people notice that sparkling water quenches thirst and improves digestion.  
  
The Bohr effect and the role of CO  
One of the key mechanisms of carbon dioxide's effect on the body is the Bohr effect.  
üß¨ CO‚ÇÇ is required for oxygen uptake by cells.  
üí° Carbon dioxide helps oxygen penetrate deeper into cells, improving their nutrition.  
  
Additional benefits of CO‚ÇÇ for the body:  
‚úî It has antitumor properties - it can stop metastases and induce apoptosis (programmed death of cancer cells).  
‚úî Blocks the HIF-ALPHA gene, which is associated with hypoxia and may contribute to the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells.  
‚úî It has anti-inflammatory effects, which explains the improvement of well-being after drinking sparkling water.  
  
CO‚ÇÇ and the environment  
üîπ During a thunderstorm, many people notice that breathing becomes easier. This is due to the increased level of carbon dioxide in the air after rain.  
üîπ Tissues are better oxygenated if we breathe through our nose, during sleep or exercise.  
üí° Healing hot springs, known for their healing properties, contain not only minerals but also CO‚ÇÇ. This may explain their relaxing and healing effects.  
üíß Carbon dioxide improves blood circulation and has a positive effect on the skin.  
  
My personal experience  
‚úÖ I drink sparkling water every day, which I prepare in a cooler from spring water.  
‚ùó CO‚ÇÇ is probably the reason why we feel better after drinking sparkling water.  
  
Common mistakes when drinking water  
1. Excessive water consumption  
Some people believe that you need to drink a lot of water, without taking into account the importance of electrolytes. This can lead to imbalances and even dehydration.  
üí° Drink as much water as your body needs.  
  
2. Drinking water too quickly  
üö∞ Rapid absorption of large volumes of water can cause sodium imbalance and provoke edema.  
  
3. Replacing water with other beverages  
Coffee, tea, alcohol, and sugary soda are not a substitute for water.  
‚òï Coffee and tea have a diuretic effect.  
üç∑Alcohol dehydrates the body.  
ü•§ Sweet carbonated drinks aggravate the problem of dehydration.  
‚ùó Also, taking diuretics with caffeine can significantly increase fluid deficiency.  
  
4. Potassium and sodium imbalance  
üßÇ Excessive potassium intake without sufficient sodium can lead to dehydration.  
‚öñA balance of sodium and potassium is critical for health.  
People often suffer from:  
üîπ Fluid retention with potassium deficiency.  
üîπ Excess salt with insufficient vegetables in the diet.  
ü•¶ Add potassium-rich vegetables to your diet to balance the balance.  
  
5. Drinking water with meals  
üö´ Drinking large amounts of water with meals can dilute gastric juice and impair digestion, contributing to acid reflux.  
üí° It is better to drink water before or after meals.

1mayluj,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1mayluj/is_this_normal_during_residency_or_is_it_just_my/,Is this normal during residency or is it just my spouse?,"My spouse started residency. Before residency he had moments where he was kind of rude or a jerk  before when he was stressed. Especially more so during the match process. But since he has started residency, he has no interest in conversation and has pretty much left me to my own devices. 

We are buying/having a home built. I am the only one doing the paperwork, planning the house designs, and trying to line everything up. I don't like it but I know it is less stress on him and he is going through a huge transition and training. 

Occasionally I have to talk to him about things he needs to do to keep the process moving. He hates it when I talk about it but, all of this is stressful. I'd not ask him if it wasn't important or its on my mind and I just need to talk about it. 

I'm currently out of the state, visiting family, and then going back to clean and finish packing up our old apartment alone. (I left for so long because he complained that we had little space in his parents apartment we are temporarily staying at. He was glad initially then got sad closer to time because I got up with him, made his coffee, lunches, etc. But he really wanted space and I promised my family a months visit and couldn't change my promise.)

Today I needed to talk to him about important stuff related to the house. He's not happy that there was another concern I had related to the mortgage application that I need to resolve with his help. 

This morning I tried to wake him up, per his request, just to get chewed out for trying to express a concern I had related to some bad advice given related to our mortgage application.

He's going in a day early to look at his assignment and just flipped from night shift back to days. He tells me talk to him about something interesting but he doesn't feel like talking. He tells me that he is stressed about work tomorrow and doesn't want to talk about what I'm telling him about. I cannot help it, this is time sensitive or we could delay closing or lose the house.

I just feel like he's short, puts me on the spot to ask me to change topics at a short notice, and just doesn't care I was left to handle this all by my self... even before residency started, he had no interest in taking the smallest amount of time to help me plan details in the house or anything. Had he, I might have had less questions to bug him about. 

I have had to research and learn so much alone, while doing all the leg work and being out of state. So managing time zones has been fantastic. 

I have been trying to help him while I am away seeing family and closing up the apartment alone. I have ordered him food. I get up at 2 am or set my alarm to whatever time he needs to wake up. 

Is this normal for residents? Is my husband going the extra mile to be a jerk? Or am I just being self centered and not understanding? 

Is there anything I can do to improve this, besides being my own rock? Do I just need to find ways to be more supportive and shrug his moodiness off? What can I do to be interesting in the limited 5 minutes or less conversations but still get important stuff done? What else can I do while I'm gone for 3 more weeks?",4,1753652951.0,family,3,1.0,False

During covid, I met a single dad (43M ) online, and we chatted everyday and we kind of helped each other get through challenging times. We lived about 1.5 hrs away so we finally met for coffee after things started getting back to normal, and it took awhile since our scheduling was difficult but we eventually became intimate. We had very good sexual chemistry and even though we only were able meet a few times, each time it was amazing and fun. 

Few months after we first became intimate, I found out I have to move overseas due to work. We were both sad but we agreed to continue to chat even after I moved, with the hopes that we can see each other again whenever I return. Our chat messages are usually brief but we are pretty open about alot of things, including sexual topics. He is sexually more adventurous than me and has more experience being with other people since he has been online dating for awhile. For me, he is the only person I have been with besides my husband during the past 20 years. I should also note that he has a kink where he gets turned on thinking about me with another guy. I don‚Äôt think I am the same way, but when he asked if I would like to know if he met someone else, I said yes since he said he likes sharing. 

It‚Äôs been 2 years since I moved away but we still message each other regularly, half the time about our day to day stuff but also alot of explicit stuff.  He tells me regularly about how he thinks I am so sexy and how horny he gets thinking about me.  He never really talked about other partners during this time, in fact he told me before that he is tired of dating and he hasn‚Äôt really had time besides working and taking care of his kid (who he has shared custody with his ex).

Recently though, he slipped that he was dating someone for some time but he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt really feeling it‚Äù. Even though he made it sound like it was a past affair, after some light probing, I found that it‚Äôs still an ongoing thing where he meets her every few weeks and he said it‚Äôs nothing serious but they just have a nice time together.  I asked him what she is like, and then he gives me two short sentences about her. First line about her build, age and ethnicity. Second line that she is ‚Äúreally tight and likes to suck so not too bad‚Äù.  I was a bit taken aback with this. I mean, I like knowing details and we are pretty open and non-judgmental with each other‚Äôs sexual experiences but I was conflicted about this comment. I mean why would you go from, not wanting to talk about other partners to me and then going straight to talk about another girl‚Äôs pussy to your ex-AP?  But then immediately after he would tell me that he was jerking off thinking of me. 

We still text each other regularly, he tells me about all the dirty thoughts he has of me and how he much he wants to see me. I stopped asking about his new partner since even though I am super curious, I guess the details do bother me. But every time I dont hear back from him during the weekend or weeknights, I get anxious thinking that he is with another girl. I guess I am jealous since I wish that I am the one that he is with. I know I have no business being jealous, but it just messes with my mind thinking about it. He also suggested a couple times that I should find someone in my current location (and he wants to know all about it) but I have absolutely no interest looking for anyone new.  

Sorry this became rather long and a rambling rant, but I also wanted some help understanding his mentality ‚Ä¶ like even though he says he is not really into this new girl but he continues to see her. Is he telling me the truth or just witholding telling me more because he thinks I will be upset?  I am also older than him so I dont want to be the petty and annoying ex-partner. I know I have no right feeling this way but it‚Äôs just been bothering me and I was wondering if anyone went through anything similar like this.

With every meal, even with a light snack (sandwich, chocolate bar, apple, pear, coffee with sugar, etc.), the pancreas produces insulin.  
What is insulin?  
Insulin is a growth hormone. It:  
‚Ä¢ absorbs sugar in the blood;  
‚Ä¢ causes cells and muscles to grow;  
‚Ä¢ participates in the formation of new muscle tissue;  
‚Ä¢ prevents muscle atrophy.  
Some bodybuilders even take insulin or consume carbohydrates to increase its levels and increase muscle mass. It would seem that this is a very useful hormone. But why do people with hyperinsulinemia (excess insulin) often develop muscle atrophy?  
  
Contradictions of insulin Insulin helps absorb potassium and magnesium.  
Fact: But people with hyperinsulinemia suffer from a deficiency of these minerals. The higher the insulin level, the lower the potassium and magnesium levels in the body.  
Insulin has a powerful anti-inflammatory effect  
Fact: However, in type 2 diabetes, when there is a lot of insulin in the body, inflammation only intensifies.  
Insulin ‚Äì an antioxidant.  
Fact: However, in type 2 diabetes, when there is a lot of insulin in the body, inflammation only intensifies.  
Insulin is an antioxidant  
But people with excess insulin experience oxidative damage and complications from diabetes.  
Insulin lowers uric acid levels.  
Fact: However, in hyperinsulinemia, uric acid levels are elevated.  
Insulin dilates blood vessels and lowers blood pressure.  
Fact: But with metabolic syndrome, a person has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and prediabetes.  
Insulin reduces glucose production in the liver.  
Fact: However, people with prediabetes and diabetes often wake up with high blood sugar levels (the ‚Äúmorning dawn‚Äù phenomenon).  
  
What is really happening?  
1. How insulin works  
Beta cells in the pancreas produce insulin and release it into the blood in response to rising glucose levels.  
Insulin interacts with receptors that regulate its production.  
If there is too much insulin, the body blocks its binding to receptors. The body is smart and realizes that it does not need so much growth hormone, especially for people after adolescence, when the body has already grown.  
2. Why does insulin resistance develop?  
Frequent insulin releases due to large amounts of carbohydrates and sugar cause the body to defend itself. It blocks the receptors to prevent uncontrolled cell growth.  
  
The result is a situation where insulin produced by the pancreas enters the bloodstream, but its receptors do not accept it because the body has blocked their function. At the same time, the glucose that caused the release of insulin also remains in the blood. Insulin has not performed its function‚Äîit has not processed the sugar.  
‚Ä¢ The receptors continue to request insulin because the blood sugar level is high.  
‚Ä¢ The pancreas begins to produce even more insulin.  
‚Ä¢ Insulin remains in the blood but does not work because the receptors are blocked.  
3. Consequences of insulin resistance  
‚Ä¢ Tests show high insulin levels, but the body experiences a deficiency.  
‚Ä¢ Prediabetes, diabetes, high blood pressure, and inflammation develop.  
‚Ä¢ The more insulin there is, the worse the receptors work.  
‚Ä¢ The more carbohydrates there are, the stronger the insulin resistance.  
4. How does insulin resistance manifest itself?  
‚Ä¢ Feeling tired after eating.  
‚Ä¢ Frequent nighttime trips to the bathroom.  
‚Ä¢ Constant hunger and cravings for carbohydrates.  
‚Ä¢ Metabolic syndrome (high cholesterol, blood pressure, sugar).  
  
These are the most well-known symptoms, but here is the complete list:  
‚Ä¢ Feeling hungry;  
‚Ä¢ Not feeling full after eating;  
‚Ä¢ Sleepiness after lunch;  
‚Ä¢ Strong craving for carbohydrates (bread, cookies, crackers);  
‚Ä¢ Elevated insulin levels;  
‚Ä¢ High blood glucose levels;  
‚Ä¢ High blood pressure;  
‚Ä¢ High cholesterol;  
‚Ä¢ Fatty liver;  
‚Ä¢ Belly fat;  
‚Ä¢ Dark folds on the neck, under the arms, in the groin;  
‚Ä¢ Papillomas;  
‚Ä¢ Fatigue during training;  
‚Ä¢ Inflammation and pain (bursitis, arthritis);  
‚Ä¢ Sleep apnea;  
‚Ä¢ Poor sleep;  
‚Ä¢ Morning dawn phenomenon;  
‚Ä¢ Slow metabolism;  
‚Ä¢ Loss of muscle mass;  
‚Ä¢ Loss of collagen in the joints;  
‚Ä¢ Dizziness;  
‚Ä¢ Depression, irritability, anxiety;  
‚Ä¢ Acne;  
‚Ä¢ Low testosterone.  
  
Mistakes in treating type 2 diabetes  
The worst thing a type 2 diabetic can do is take insulin. It only worsens resistance and increases the risk of complications.  
According to medical professors:  
‚Ä¢    80% of people suffer from insulin resistance.  
‚Ä¢ It increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by 540% (high cholesterol only by 30%).  
Now it becomes clear why the above facts seem contradictory. A person has a lot of insulin in their blood, but due to resistance, it is not enough to perform its functions. This leads to prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension, and inflammation.

How to easily start fasting  
The first 48 hours are the hardest.  
Ideally, you should start fasting with a dry fast for the first 24‚Äì36 hours, but this is not necessary. However, it is often easier to start fasting on a dry fast.  
It can be psychologically difficult. Food gives you pleasure, which your brain will expect because it is used to receiving it regularly.  
Then it will be effective to eat something on the first and or second day that will not interrupt the process of entering ketosis. Salted peanuts are very good - about 30 grams and drink green tea with cinnamon, or coffee with coconut milk and cinnamon. At this time, it is better for you to consume less spices if you do decide to have a snack.  And this day, when you have only one such meal, you can already consider it a fast. Your body is already in ketosis. A third of a teaspoon of turmeric will also reduce hunger and speed up the body's entry into ketosis.  
During these two days, it is better to be outside, in the sun, in the fresh air. After the first 24 to 36 hours, your testosterone levels will rise and you will feel a surge of energy.   
Schedule a workout during this time, preferably outdoors. If you have not been exercising at all, then light running, slowly, with breaks and stretching after running is for you.  
Here's what to do when you feel hungry in the first 24-36 hours or during a closed food window:  
1. Massage your abdomen, relax standing up and gently press the front and sides of your abdomen, inhale, pulling your abdomen in as far as possible, and hold your breath as long as you can. It is ideal to achieve 2 minutes of air retention. Repeat several times.  
2. Buy sea salt or pink Himalayan salt and put a pinch on your tongue. It has minerals and electrolytes that the body needs, then drink water.  
3. Drink mineral water with natural lemon - namely, sparkling water with bubbles and fresh lemon with skin and seeds. Drink more mineral water - right now your body needs minerals.  
4. A pinch of turmeric (it accelerates the transition to ketosis - when the body begins to feed on its own fat).  
5. A clove of garlic, green tea with ginger and cinnamon - this can solve many problems. They will provide the body with antioxidants, phytonutrients, vitamins and electrolytes.  
6. Drink a cup of coffee with coconut milk and cinnamon.  
7. Brew green tea with mint or lemon balm, lemongrass tea with mint is also a great option during fasting. I usually brew these teas with other herbs and/or mushrooms - the phytonutrients in herbs support the liver.  
In the state of ketosis, you have a lot of energy and you don't feel hungry at all, because fat provides more energy than glucose. Both the brain and the heart like it better when the body is powered by its own fat.",1,1753652682.0,u_your-price-booking,0,1.0,False

I assume they are meltdowns but I can kinda push through. Basically everything becomes too much, I freak out and end up snapping at people with little control over what I'm saying and unable to verbalise much and then I'm really emotionally vulnerable and exhausted for the rest of the day. I can continue doing things but it's hellish. 

The issue is that I get 'told off' for snapping at people at these times as it appears really out of character.
I do appreciate that people don't like being snapped at but almost feel like if I was doing the old skool stereotypes of banging my head against a wall or screaming into the void then at least ppl would click that something more was going on than me just being a massive bitch. 

At my kids birthday party ( lots of kids, loud Spiderman songs playing) I shouted 'stop it' at my bfs mum and her friend when she kept asking me questions.

A coffee shared. A quick chat by the doorway. The way someone‚Äôs presence can soften an entire day without even trying.

There‚Äôs someone in my life who probably doesn‚Äôt even realize how much light they bring me. I‚Äôve seen them in hard times. I‚Äôve watched them fight battles no one else sees. Yet still, they make my heart feel like home.

Sometimes love isn‚Äôt about grand declarations or perfect timing.

Sometimes it‚Äôs about making sure someone eats when they forget to.

Cooking a small meal late at night because you know they haven‚Äôt been eating well. Standing there as they eat, feeling this quiet warmth in your chest, knowing in that simple moment, you were able to care for them in a way words never could.

Or showing up with a coffee just to make them smile.

Or quietly holding space for them when they‚Äôre too tired to hold space for themselves.

The way their laugh sneaks out unexpectedly and makes the air feel lighter.

The way their eyes soften when they‚Äôre really listening.

Even just standing near them feels like the noise of the world turns down a notch.

I‚Äôve learned that real care doesn‚Äôt shout. It shows up quietly, over and over, until trust grows like sunlight through the cracks, and that person feels safe again. And when you see someone‚Äôs soul you can‚Äôt help but believe in their healing, their wholeness, their happiness.

To that person: you‚Äôre more than enough exactly as you are. You are seen. You are loved, even on the days you can‚Äôt feel it. And every little thing you do, even the smallest smile, ripples out and changes someone‚Äôs entire world.

Sometimes I catch myself imagining what the future might look like, not in a desperate way, but in that soft, certain way you imagine a sunrise.

A quiet knowing that someday, somehow, we‚Äôll be standing in the same place at the same time, and it will just make sense. It will just feel like home. 

Until then, I‚Äôll keep showing up with these little gestures, these little sparks of care, because love, real love, doesn‚Äôt give up.

It waits. It believes. And it cherishes the tiny everyday moments that make life worth living.

I‚Äôm willing to push myself hard. But I don‚Äôt want to crash, burn out, or damage my body in the process. So my question is, what‚Äôs the best and most effective approach to lose as much weight as possible in these 40 days?  
Should I do this dry fast thing? Switch to clean eating and train hard? Do OMAD (something like eating one meal a day in a short period) combined with Islamic fasting thing? I‚Äôm doing everything I can, but I need real guidance. If you‚Äôre willing to help, I‚Äôll post daily updates here progress, diet, gym, weight. Just need some honest advice from people who‚Äôve been through this.

Thank you so much, I hope this will work this time :)",15,1753652330.0,loseit,20,0.83,False

## Key features analysis

The best pumpkin spice K-Cups share common characteristics that contribute to their overall quality and flavor. These features range from the sourcing of the coffee beans themselves to the specific spices used in the blend.

**Coffee Bean Quality**

The foundation of any great cup of coffee lies in the quality of the beans. The best pumpkin spice K-Cups utilize Arabica beans,known for their smooth,aromatic flavor and lower acidity compared to Robusta beans. Some brands may even specify the origin of their beans, such as Central or South America, indicating a commitment to sourcing premium ingredients. High-quality beans ensure a rich, balanced coffee base that complements the pumpkin spice flavors.

**Spice Blend Authenticity**

The spice blend is what truly defines a pumpkin spice K-Cup. Authentic blends incorporate a combination of cinnamon,nutmeg,ginger,and cloves,mirroring the traditional spices used in pumpkin pie. The proportions of each spice can vary,creating distinct flavor profiles. Some blends may emphasize cinnamon for a warm sweetness, while others might highlight ginger for a zesty kick. K-Cups that use natural spices, rather than artificial flavorings, generally deliver a more nuanced and enjoyable taste experience.

**Roast Profile Robustness**

The roast profile of the coffee beans plays a crucial role in the overall flavor profile of the K-Cup. Medium roasts tend to be the most popular choice for pumpkin spice blends, as they offer a balanced flavor that allows both the coffee and the spices to shine. Dark roasts can add a smoky depth,but may overpower the delicate pumpkin spice flavors if not carefully balanced. Light roasts can result in a brighter, more acidic cup, which may not be as well-suited to the warm, comforting nature of pumpkin spice.

**Sweetener Level Balance**

Many pumpkin spice K-Cups contain sweeteners to enhance the overall flavor and appeal to a wider audience. However, the level of sweetener can significantly impact the drinking experience. The best K-Cups strike a balance, providing a touch of sweetness without being overly sugary or artificial tasting. Some brands offer unsweetened versions, allowing consumers to customize the sweetness to their preference.The use of natural sweeteners, such as cane sugar or stevia, can also contribute to a more wholesome and enjoyable taste.

**Aroma Intensity and Allure**

Aromatic experience is a crucial but often overlooked aspect of enjoying pumpkin spice coffee. A compelling aroma can set the stage for a delightful brewing experience. The highest-rated pumpkin spice K-Cups tend to exhibit a pleasant fragrance that carries both the rich scent of freshly brewed coffee and the distinct notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and other warming spices. This evocative aroma enhances the overall sense of warmth and comfort associated with the beverage.

**Compatibility and ease-of-use**

Compatibility with Keurig brewers (2.0 and beyond) and the ease of use are also important factors.All K-Cups should maintain consistent water flow during the brewing cycle, and be resistant to leaking. The packaging should enable easy handling without compromising the integrity of the coffee grounds inside the pod.

Key features of the best pumpkin spice K-Cups include:

* High-quality Arabica beans
* Authentic spice blend with natural ingredients
* Medium roast profile
* Balanced sweetness level
* compelling aroma
* Proven compatibility with Keurig Brewers

1may9t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1may9t4/i_29f_am_at_my_wits_end_with_my_fiancee_34m_whos/,I (29F) am at my wits end with my fiancee (34M) who's trying to be a good man.,"Throwaway account and vague. I do want to save my relationship but I am at a loss and don't know if I should try and what to try or if I should give up.

Me (29F) and my fiancee (34M) have been together upwards of five years. we recently moved to a new city and got engaged shortly after. We have had a rocky road but I blamed a lot of it on our prior state of living. We lived in a state where we both had a lot of trauma hence the move. Ever since we got engaged I've become more and more unsure about our relationship. Before we started dating there was some issues of him not really treating me like I mattered even though we were sleeping together.

 For example my dog had died while he was on vacation. I drove him to the airport that morning my dog died in the afternoon. I loved this dog she meant so much to me and I had her for nine years. He texted me when he got on the plane and I let him know what had happened. He told me call him or text him when he landed so he could be there for me and then he ghosted me until I had to pick him up from the airport a week later and he texted me if I would be there. He never brought it up. 

There was a medical situation I had and I told him at a party that he was not invited to but I brought him as my plus one because he was bummed he didn't get invited. The situation was extremely heartbreaking for me and I thought I was going to die. When I told him he hadn't been drinking yet. He then spent the rest of the night trying to get into some girls pants, ignoring me and getting shit faced. That was before we were officially dating.

Over the years he has changed and matured into a good man but I don't think we are fundamentally compatible and at this point all the I'm sorry and I'll change and everything else he says doesn't feel believable and he's just leading me with a carrot I'll never get. 

For instance I spent two years with a man who continued to SA me in the relationship and pimp me out to whoever it didn't matter. One of the people he handed me over to got in contact with me years later saying he remembered how good head I was. It made sick and I flew into a full blown panic attack. but I also wanted to feel like I had control of the situation. My fiancee tried to block him and write something to him to try to take the phone from me. I told him no I wanted to handle it myself but I wanted his support. We got into a fight because I wouldn't let him handle it the way he wanted to and I ended up apologizing to him. He told me it would never happen again. However we recently found out someone he knows and who he is not close with may have SA'd someone else he know. I asked him a few days later why he was still in a chat with them and he got defensive and pusedo defended them. Knowing my history he even had the nerve to ask me ""if it had been one of your friend would you just cut them off. "" And of course I said yes without question. Then it was another I'm sorry I didn't realize and so on. 

He is an extremely defensive person and feels like I am blaming the failure of our relationship on him and I've just given up. I went to therapy twice after we started dating to make sure I could communicate effectively with him and to make sure there wasn't something I was doing that maybe I didn't realize. I had to beg him to go to FREE therapy. He did and it helped but I have now made the condition that he has to go again for at least 6 months before we get married. Even that feels like I'm begging. He doesn't like to make decisions or cause issues even when he should. He is just letting the water take him wherever and he just lives in that space. He knows he is an aggressively defensive person the last time we argued really bad he hit himself in the head. He is forgetful like a lot. One of the big things I've continued to bring up is that we don't go on dates nothing feels special but I'll tell him hey lets go here or here we can make it a date but I'm leaving it to you to plan. I give him the pieces and then he forgets.... Makes me worry he will forget really important things like doctors appointments for kids and stuff like that. 

And I know I have my things, I'm emotional and sometimes I'm closed off. I can be to direct and prioritize being efficient. I value my alone time over meeting new people and I sulk sometimes and don't wanna talk. In all the years we have been together though I've never made him question if I care about him. I asked him if there has ever been something I've done that really hurt his feelings. He said ""You called me a dumbass before"". I haven't done it since and I asked him this just last month.

It's not like he's not trying but I'm at a place in my life where I don't think it's worth sticking around to find out if he will change. He's not a bad man, he works hard and he is not judgemental on how I want to live my life. He wants to do things for me like he gets me coffee if I ask and he buy me something if he's got the money. He doesn't care about my weight or the times I cry a lot. He has supported me when I lost my job and listens when I ramble. He knows he needs therapy and I think he will go eventually. He loves his family and is loyal to a fault. I believe he loves me and he wants me to be happy. We are the best of friends at points but feel world's apart at others. 

 I don't know if it's enough though and I don't know if I'm asking to much. It's feeling more like I have an angry toddler then a partner. Is there anything I can do to save this? I don't want to leave but I also don't want to be a perpetual emotional wreck.",2,1753652104.0,relationship_advice,6,0.75,False

RE KetoMojo: 
Through reading other posts, I see many comments that are not in support of glucose and ketone tracking. 

Kindly remember, there is a difference  between following the general keto diet and keto that results in extended periods high ketosis.

In addition, data collection, G&K tracking, weighing foods, and a keto diet in its' strictest form are required while receiving treatment in a Metobolic Psychiatry Program.

I'm planning to buy a house thats like anywhere between ¬£7 million to ¬£10 million (I think thats like $13 to 18 million Canadian dollars or something like that) or I don't know if ill buy a house for more than that but thats my budget at the moment. I'm only mentioning this because I‚Äôm aware some areas are more catered to high-end housing and lifestyles. I'm using a burner account because I don't know how weird of a request this is but I just want to know where is the best place for me specifically to live!

  
I LOVE snow and I need an area that snows every year without fail and I hate summer sunshine (I can deal with it but at most roughly 20 degrees celsius nothing more than like 22 Celsius). I also don't need any more rainy climates like the UK lol. I don't want the destination to be a holiday area though where people are using the area as a second home or only as a ski resort location as thats quite lonely and just too touristy for me to make a house there my primary home. I want my neighbours to be very friendly and sweet like the type of neighbours that love hanging out together. I cannot stand a cliquey area of people that do not let ""outsiders"" into their bubble of friends- it's not nice behaviour and obviously don't want to live somewhere like that at all! This is especially the case as I am making the wild decision to live on my own there so I want an easy transition and to be able to make friends easily. I obviously do not like the idea of racism and would prefer not to live in a racist area. I also do not want to be in an area thats got a lot of ghetto behaviour or violence especially being a woman living alone. I would love a really lovely community where people are so welcoming and neighbours actually invite you over for tea or just to hangout. I need somewhere that still has enough black hair dressers for when I do want to get my hair done but It's not a deal breaker I can just take a flight/ travel to do so but it would be convenient to have some nearby- but its not a dealbreaker at all! I do not want the area to be ""boring"" at all- what I mean in terms of this is I need to be able to go out and do yoga or pilates and just things to do in general like when I do eventually make friends there I want to be able to actually do stuff not just coffee shops. I cannot stress enough that when I move to this new place I do not at all want cliquey behaviour which makes it hard for me to socialise as im very extroverted and want to make friends, obviously, I dont need people that have all known each other since 2 years old or something like that- ive been there, done that never again hahaha. I like the type of people who do brunches, host wine nights just hanging out pretty much, but are still friendly and open. 

I do not want my wealth to be a factor in terms of who I interact with, I love interacting with everyone thats lovely to me and nice neighbours.

  
I think it's important to also mention I do love to party and go on holidays, get up to stuff and yeah hahaha. I'm just looking for an area that people aren't like super religious or an area thats predominantly old people. I want people that would be my age by then and are down to actually have fun. I'm not working a job just living life. I need to also add that I do not know how to speak French and I would love to respectfully stay away from areas that ONLY/ Mostly speak French or if it's like a feeling of ""missing out"", not fully connecting with others over me not knowing French. 

  
I would want a nice age demographic of people that are 20-35, like a nice healthy amount of that age category. I do have a type in romantic partners which I feel I must mention as realistically I am looking to settle down and get married there and; My romantic ""type"" is white men- please don't label me as racist or something for this. I just wanted to be transparent about that since I‚Äôd love to live somewhere where that‚Äôs not seen as unusual or taboo. This doesn't happen to me personally in the UK but I hear about it and I do not need to experience that.



PS: If anyone here lives in a place like this and loves it, I'd love to hear what daily life feels like ‚Äî even small things like grocery stores, how people make friends, what people wear out, etc. Thanks in advance!

Writing this is my attempt to spread caution and worry to all fellow sailors. Please heed my warnings. It‚Äôs a fool who mistakes them for mere ramblings.

***August 13, 1999***

Although I have only been stationed in England and captain of this vessel for 3 short months, that's all the time its taken for me to have grown to truly despise most of my crew. On all previous ships the company has stationed me on Id always been granted the courtesy of personally picking my crew. For months I've been forced to stomach rubbing shoulders with a group of pompous, arrogant Brits.

This bunch is by far the most self-aggrandizing lot of sailors Id ever seen. Out of the six other souls on this vessel only one do I consider a conversation with barrable. Selina somehow was able to make that horrid accent of hers sound like music. Even so, I was more then pleased when informed that this would be the last run Id be making as captain of this ship. We‚Äôve been tasked with transporting cargo back to America and not a second to soon in my opinion. England's gloomy weather combined with frankly inedible food is beginning to takes its toll on my mental wellbeing. Soon I will be rid of blood sausage and tea and return home to strong coffee and steak.

Hopefully this will be one of the rare voyages we don‚Äôt run into *them* but I doubt we'll be that lucky.

***August 24, 1999***

Were less then 2 weeks into the trip yet the crew have already begun to report hearing a song. By my recollection this is the earliest they've ever showed up. Very rarely do they ever travel this far from home. My hunch is that it has something to due with the group of boisterous Englishmen aboard. I fear maybe were just to enticing for them to resist.

Nights no longer bring only stars and darkness, joining the pair is the all to familiar sound of a hauntingly beautiful drone. Each night the hums grow in intensity and inch ever closer towards our vessel. This is how it always starts, the scouts use this hum as a sort of bait.

They‚Äôre looking to see if there are any eligible victims on board, which there always are.

***September 1, 1999***

I find myself fighting the unwavering feeling of fear which has begun to slowly creep in. Somehow I had always managed to withstand their inviting song but I'm weaker now both in physical and emotional prowess. Perhaps this was the time my luck would truly run dry and my soul would finally be the one called for judgment.

The crew shares in my emotions but theirs are much less subtle. They look to me for guidance but I have none to give. Thoughts of reassuring the group with some false promise of safety have crossed my mind but I‚Äôve never been one for lying.

No matter what I tell them the fact remains this, one man on this ship will never step foot on land again.

***September 4, 1999***

Illuminated only by the untainted ocean sky, piercing the almost still waters are ten pale, leathery serrated fins. Each breach stripping the thin vail of beauty from their temptress song. Reviling the true screeching tune that bellows out from their full lips. Below the song was enchanting and warm but above harsh and frightening. The ocean seemed to act as some sort of natural autotune.

Religious or not every man on this ship began to pray at the mere sight of these abominations. However, amongst all the fearful pleading there was one that showed no signs of worry. Seemingly anchored by a sense of unwavering eerie calmness, Selina was unphased. Come to think of it she was the only one who never did seek me out for knowledge on our situation. In my opinion, it looked almost as if she somehow knew exactly what was happening.

She knows as well as I that come tomorrow we'd be down one crew member.

***September 5, 1999***

Awoken in the wee hours, I heard from within my sleeping quarters what I now know to be the final moments of a fellow sailors life.

The bewitching song swelled loudly, reaching an all time volume. Joining along in the singing now was what sounded to be a male voice. Heroic thoughts cross my mind but I dare not to act on them. For the last time this ritual was interfered with by an ignorant fool, more than one man was taken that night. No, whatever poor soul was out there is a dead man walking.

Suddenly the singing ceased, the mans footsteps came to halt and for a brief moment I hoped that they would spare him. Shattering both my hopes and the silence the sound of a large splash now echoed through my head.

Silence, no more singing, no desperate splashing or cry‚Äôs for help, nothing more than the sound of soft waves brushing up against the hull. I shed a genuine tear of sorrow that night, for a mother had just lost her son.

Not a minute later I was informed that Simon Bromwich was missing.

***September 12, 1999***

Simons disappearance expectedly made the crews fear ever more potent. Even after I assured them that the ordeal had reached its conclusion they still insisted they were in imminent danger. Only me and Selina knew those things had gotten what they came for, after all they only ever take one.

When we finally arrived at port a few of the men actually kissed the docks with relief. I could tell those men would undoubtably be changing occupations. I knew even Selina was happier once of the ship, I saw straight through her poker face.

For me the worst part of my job comes after we dock. It had become just another one of my tasks to report back to the company who needed to be taken off the payroll. I decided that this seventy ninth call would be the last I make.

No longer would I willing work for a company that knowingly trade lives for cargo.

***Present Day***

Our oceans are some of the most beautiful places on earth but underneath all there beauty lies an infestation. Swarming in the waters are apex predators that no man on earth can resist. These things have learned there's no easier prey then a weak man with weaker morals. Utilizing their beauty as bait for gods weakest creations.

They‚Äôve honed the ability to enhance men's base instinct tenfold, so much so that a man would willingly die for a chance at satisfaction. I pray this warning finds those who need it and I pray for the souls of those foolish enough to ignore it.

So, guys, I‚Äôm curious... Have you ever felt like your brain is a browser with *too many tabs* open at once? ü§Ø Yeah, me too! This year, I decided to tackle that chaos with one teeny-tiny habit ‚òïÔ∏è‚Äîand let me tell you, it‚Äôs been a game-changer!

**Enter: My morning coffee ritual.** Wait, wait‚Äîdon‚Äôt roll your eyes just yet! I‚Äôm not talking about just slamming a cup of joe and calling it a day. Here‚Äôs what I mean:

- **Set a *dedicated* coffee time**: Instead of sipping my brew while scrolling through social media or half-listening to a podcast, I started dedicating those precious 15 minutes to *just* enjoying the coffee. I let myself savor each sip, focusing on the aroma, the warmth, and the taste. It‚Äôs basically mindfulness in a cup! ‚òï

- **Zero distractions**: I leave my phone in another room (yeah, that‚Äôs a bold move, I know) and I let myself be present in that moment. No emails, no notifications‚Äîjust me and my coffee. Trust me, the world doesn‚Äôt crumble without checking your phone for 15 minutes!

- **Jot down thoughts while I sip**: I keep a cute little notebook handy and, while I‚Äôm sipping, I‚Äôll write down any to-do‚Äôs or thoughts that pop up. It‚Äôs like clearing the mental clutter, ensuring that I can dive into the day without feeling like I‚Äôm chasing my own thoughts. 

And guess what? This simple ritual has not only boosted my focus, but it‚Äôs also become a little moment of joy that I genuinely look forward to each day. üéâ 

But I‚Äôm wondering‚Äîhave any of you discovered a tiny habit that turned out to be a *focus powerhouse*? Maybe it‚Äôs a different morning routine, a quick stretch, or some weird breathing exercise? Whatever it is, I‚Äôd love to hear about it! Just imagine: all these tiny changes can add up and transform how we tackle our day-to-day.

Howdy. I don‚Äôt post things very often, or at all for that matter. But reading and seeing everyone‚Äôs input on a wide variety of topics has helped me tremendously. So I feel compelled to post my experience that happened just an hour ago. 


A little background on myself since I think it necessary to mention.  I‚Äôm a 38M. Live in Fort Worth, TX. Worked construction since it was 18. Commercial Glazier by trade for all 20 years. Danger is a constant thing you always need to be aware of. Heavy equipment, overhead hazards, working at elevated heights, large pokey things that are trying to stab you, holes you can fall into or thru, getting crushed to death, the list could go on and on. But you are constantly trained to recognize those dangers and are equipped with PPE (gear) to combat them. That gear will treat you same way you treat it. Disrespect it, and it will show you the same courtesy when you need it. When you spend so many years in that type of business, you WILL see things. Mostly minor, but then you get the couple that bring everything back into perspective for you. Hell I just had 2 instances at work last week that snapped my focus back into alignment (Brick layer fell 20‚Äô from scaffolding down to uneven and debris covered lime treated dirt. Only suffered broken ribs on one side which is a miracle.  He shouldn‚Äôt be walking away from that. For context, lime treated dirt will harden it to allow heavy machinery to drive over it without sinking. Still happens all the time though.  Then we had an employee severely cut himself throwing insulated windows into a dumpster like a frisbee . The broken glass was still attached to the spacer and whipped around and showed him what it‚Äôs like when you loose the respect you had for it).  My experiences in my career have served me well in life and feel incredibly blessed to have never been on the receiving end of the reality. 


I just started riding street motorcycles about a month ago. Ive rode dirt bikes and atv‚Äôs most of my childhood so I was naturally drawn to wanting to ride a street bike. My dad had a ninja 600 and acted like an absolute kracken on the thing. My mom never knew his riding habits until she caught him on the road riding like a fool. He sold the bike a couple weeks later and my mom never let him ride again.  So any chance of me getting on 2 wheels disappeared with my dads. So off to the tuner scene I went and acted like an absolute hooligan out there. I still don‚Äôt understand how I never went to jail or worse, kill my self or others. But that didn‚Äôt stop anyone else that I was with to do it. With those experiences, I was done with it pretty early in my life. It also shaped how I operated a vehicle in my maturity.  Then with the years of driving in one of the worst states in the US, I‚Äôve gotten accustomed to everyone trying to kill me all at once. About a year ago a fire inside me lit and I wanted to get a motorcycle. My wife thinks this is my midlife crisis and she‚Äôs probably right. lol. But she supported me 100%. No grief at all. So I was free to pursue my childhood dream uninhibited. Researched my states requirements to get a license and started saving for the MSF class, my first set of gear and of course a motorcycle. I watched hours and hours of videos on you tube.  Thank you Motojitsu, DDFM, Fortnine, yammie noob and a few others. They gave me so much useful information and I‚Äôm forever grateful for it. It got me in the mindset I needed to be to ride a motorcycle. For what I wanted out the motorcycle, I settled on a Honda Grom. Paid cash and hauled it back to the house. Grabbed the gear and I scheduled the MSF about a month later.  I was a touch shaky at first durning the MSF, but as the old saying goes, you never forget how to ride a bike, everything slowly came back to me. The videos I watched helped more than you realize. My nervousness turned into confidence and passed the course with zero marks.  This process took a year from the moment the seed was planted in my head. I‚Äôve put about 150 miles between practice and local city street on the grom so far (baby numbers. lol)


Today‚Äôs events (the whole reason for this long ass post):
I planned on going out yesterday evening for a ride around Lake Worth. There‚Äôs some nice curvy roads that almost go around the entire lake with speed limits at 30mph. Perfect for the grom and perfect to get some practice in. Well weather in Texas sucks and as soon as i get finished with my T-CLOCS,  Thunderstorm rolls thru and cancels my plans. Ok, whatever, I‚Äôll just cancel today and go out in the morning. Woke up this morning and had my coffee outside. It was beautiful and the clouds covered the sun. Perfect day to ride. I finish my coffee and my wife is up by that time. I get dressed and start putting my gear on. I tell my wife where I‚Äôm going to be and about how long I plan on being out, give her a kiss and tell her I love her. Same with my daughter. I highly recommend apps like Detecht with crash alerts and the ability to follow you in your travels. Go thru my inspections again and finish gearing up while the bike warms up then I go on my way. I‚Äôm about 3-4 miles into my ride. I stop at an intersection the crosses a city highway leading to downtown ft worth. 45mph speed limit. I approach the hwy intersection as the lead driver at the light. I‚Äôve made it a habit to watch my mirrors when stopping at an intersection before I relax my awareness level a degree. I see a Lexus coupe approaching behind me slowly and stops a car distance behind me. I‚Äôm thankful for that and relax myself from the rear and start focusing more intently up front. I usually will scan left, front, right, and rear while I‚Äôm waiting on the light to change. Taking note of the colors of the signal lights to judge when it‚Äôs about to be my turn to pass thru the intersection. The lights start changing so I start preparing to go. As soon as that light changes to green (I always scan left, right, left. Even in a cage, before I go) I scan to my right and see the car in the turn lane on the hwy make a u-turn, and then a full sized truck coming the opposite way, slam into them at full speed. 20 feet in front of me. I‚Äôve seen plenty of accidents. But not this close and that exposed to it. That slow motion everyone talks about is real as shit. I could see the sparkles of glass and dirt flying around like LeBron blew it from his hands. There was a moment of shock for me for sure.   All I could think about in that moment was ‚Äúthat would have been me.  That would have been fucking me if I didn‚Äôt stop and check the intersection before I drove off‚Äù. Me and the Lexus behind me pulled off to the side and checked on the occupants. No serious injuries but both of them were out of it understandably.  They were both at fault on this. 2 drivers running red lights at the same time created a perfect storm. Stupid decision on there part. After I get done with giving a statement, the Lexus driver came up to me and said ‚Äúdude I could have watched you get killed just then‚Äù.  Yep very close. I got back on the road and had to pull over. That RATTLED me and needed a min to process without the flashing lights and badges. Called my wife and told her what happened. I told her I was glad that I decided to start this journey when I was older. If I was younger, I would have went as soon as that light turned green and maybe checking the intersection mid way thru it.  I wouldn‚Äôt have been as defensive with driving as I am now. She agreed and glad I was safe. I rode around for another hour before coming home. 


Your driving habits 100% translate to riding a motorcycle on the same roads. Good or bad. The same can be said for how you approach your saftey when doing very dangerous and unsafe activities. My respect for that has a lot to do on how I approach life day to day.  And saved my life. I‚Äôve had my license for 24 years. Had my share of close calls with other drivers. But never had an encounter that violent and in your face like the one that happened today. 


I love all of you as a brother should when you‚Äôre in the trenches dodging the same bullets. (Harley riders too, even though you never fuckin wave back! lol). Keep those 2 planted and upright. Live to ride again.  Wearing your gear will minimize the injury, but the most important piece of that gear is something you can‚Äôt take off. Your brain. And if you disrespect it and don‚Äôt care to use it, a cager will remove it for you. 


TL;DR:
Mid aged contractor worker decided that riding motorcycles is going to be his mid life crisis. A perfect ride almost turned catastrophic. Don‚Äôt be dumb, use your brain and stay alive! ‚úåüèª.

I wrote about my husband yelling at me, insulting me, threatening me, emotionally draining me, and how he once slapped me while I was breastfeeding our newborn.

Since then we started marriage counseling, on my initiative. I was hoping it might be a step toward some kind of change or at least better communication. But after just a few sessions he refused to go anymore. He claimed the counselor was attacking him and being unfair. To me it seemed like she simply saw through him, saw him without the mask, and he couldn‚Äôt handle it.

Things didn‚Äôt get better after that. He still swears at me horribly, often yells at me in front of the kids, and insults them too. A few days ago, after I came home from a short coffee with some friends, my three-year-old told me that daddy threw him onto the couch and yelled at him. He looked scared. And I felt completely broken because I‚Äôm trying to protect him.

The same pattern keeps repeating. Every time I do something for myself, even just an hour with a friend, he becomes moody, tired, distant, cold. Like he‚Äôs punishing me. It happens every single time.

The other day my mom came over and he had one of his outbursts again. He was rude to me in front of her, raised his voice, and humiliated me. I felt like I had to explain it away, make excuses, hide it somehow. I hate that I‚Äôve reached the point where I‚Äôm trying to normalize things that aren‚Äôt normal at all.

But I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm scared of the divorce, scared of facing the whole process, scared of what people will think, of what he might do, of how I‚Äôll survive all of it. I‚Äôm also scared I don‚Äôt have the strength.

But I also don‚Äôt want to live a lie anymore. I don‚Äôt want my sons to grow up thinking this is what love looks like. And I don‚Äôt want them to ask me one day why I stayed.

I don‚Äôt even know exactly what I‚Äôm hoping for with this post. I guess I just need a sign. A sign that this really is abuse. That this really isn‚Äôt a good marriage. That I‚Äôm not imagining it or overreacting. That I‚Äôm not crazy for feeling so lost and hurt all the time.

Thank you for reading. Your words already helped me once. Maybe they will again.

‚ÄòKill them all, Steven.‚Äô

I paused, stupefied, before responding aloud.

‚ÄúWhat the actual fuck does that mean?!‚Äù I said, far too loudly. I heard the neighbor‚Äôs hedge trimmer cut out suddenly, presumably to listen to the complete nervous breakdown happening on my back deck.

The mantis paused, tilting her head coquettishly, appearing deep in contemplation. The tapping resumed.

‚ÄòKill them for me,‚Äô she tapped on the sunbaked wooden boards.

*I am never doing acid again.* I struggled to my feet, pulse throbbing through my skull.

‚ÄúFuck this. I am not going to entertain my obvious spiral into insanity,‚Äù I muttered under my breath, mindful now of the eavesdropping neighbor and struggled to my feet and turned to go inside.

‚ÄúDave, mind your fucking business!‚Äù I shouted across the hedge before opening the door.

The sliding glass door sounded like a ton of bricks falling inside my skull as it rattled open and shut. *I need to get more WD-40.* I released a deep breath in an attempt to calm the cataclysm currently splitting my head.

‚ÄúSTEVEN?!‚Äù ¬†My wife Debra‚Äôs shrill voice a gong in my ears.

I winced.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

*Leave me alone.*

‚ÄúOh my god! I was so worried!‚Äù She came barreling down the stairs into the kitchen toward me, eyes red-rimmed and puffy. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt answering your phone and I didn‚Äôt know where you were and you were gone all night and I-I-I-.‚Äù She tackled me with all the grace of a drunk gorilla and collapsed into hysterical hiccupping sobs.

*I want to pull out my own teeth.*

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, Deb. I just needed some time.‚Äù

She looked up at me, incredulous.

‚ÄúSome time?! You could have told me! I‚Äôve had Teddy up crying all night ‚Äòcause he thought Daddy was dead in a ditch!‚Äù

I extracted myself from her grasp and took a step back.

‚ÄúWell. It‚Äôs not my fault he has his mother‚Äôs tendency of jumping to conclusions.‚Äù

‚ÄúSTEVEN!‚Äù

I pinched the bridge of my nose, struggling with the cacophony of noises echoing through my brain.

‚ÄúCould you not shout?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy god, Steven. Sometimes I could swear you wouldn‚Äôt care if the kids and I just disappeared.‚Äù

*Maybe she‚Äôs smarter than I give her credit for.*

She watched me with an assessing eye that made me think of a jaguar watching passing prey.

‚ÄúSteven, how in the world did you get so sunburnt?‚Äù *God, that is the same voice she uses on the kids when they stain their clothes. Gag.*

I put my hands on her shoulders and moved her to the side so I could walk past.

‚ÄúWhere are you going?! We need to talk about this!‚Äù

‚ÄúTo eat all the painkillers in this house and vomit all over your pillows.‚Äù

I heard her furious intake of breath behind me, winding up to full tantrum mode.

I rapidly and haphazardly made my way up the stairs away from the waiting storm and into the master bathroom where I downed far more than the recommended dosage of Advil. I could hear Debra downstairs, apparently slamming every single kitchen cabinet shut on repeat, waiting for her target to return. Sitting on the side of the bathtub I pulled my phone out of my pocket.

‚ÄúFuck me.‚Äù Apparently at some point during my night of drunken debauchery I had shattered my phone screen. And it was dead. Neat. I moved to the bedroom and hooked it up to the charger and stumbled onto the cool sheets. I idly listened to my throbbing heartbeat chug-chugging through my head for a few minutes.

*BUZZ BUZZ*

‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù I muttered, exasperated, to my pillow. Squinting one eye over at my now charging phone I saw the ‚ÄòNew Voicemail‚Äô notification pop up. I gave a massive grumble and dragged the phone to my ear, dialing voicemail as I did so.

‚ÄúStevie-boy!‚Äù My boss Charlie‚Äôs moronic voice shouted. I pulled the phone a couple inches from my ear. ‚ÄúListen. I was looking over your work again earlier and I got to say, you really screwed the pooch worse than I thought! I‚Äôm going to need you to come in on Saturday and fix it. I reckon it might take you all day!‚Äù He laughed joyously. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come in too so I can walk you through it since you don‚Äôt seem to understand what needs to be done. See you tomorrow!‚Äù

I screeched into my pillow.

¬†

It took me 30 straight minutes to extricate myself from the nag, 20 of which were getting her to stop crying after she decided I didn‚Äôt love her anymore. It should have been easier to get her believe that wasn‚Äôt true; after all, it wasn‚Äôt a lie since I don‚Äôt think I had ever really loved her at all. Apparently, I was losing my touch at getting her off my dick about everything. Another 40 minutes were wasted on a drive into the city to the office, seeing red the whole way. When I finally stepped off the elevator, it was past 11 am.

Charlie must have heard the elevator because that fat bastard was standing right in front of me when the doors opened.

‚ÄúStevie-boy! You are SO late! Did you not get my call?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy phone died.‚Äù

*Like I wish you had.*

‚ÄúGuess you should be more responsible!‚Äù

I walked past him toward my cubicle.

‚ÄúStevie! I expect it done right this time!‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. I‚Äôll get right to it.‚Äù

*Eat it raw, rat bastard.*

¬†

For the next 5 hours I worked in fits and starts, trying to fix the mistakes that riddled the Jones account. I really had made a mess of the thing in my growing antipathy and my rage-editing the day before. Charlie appeared every 30 minutes like clockwork to hover obnoxiously over my shoulder and make unnecessary comments and critiques. I tried my best to ignore him and his ever-present cloud of body odor, old coffee, and stale cigarette smoke.

When I finally finished it was almost 5 pm, having taken a long hour for lunch to get the fuck away from *Charlie-boy* before I killed him. Several times throughout the day, I could swear that I could hear the tap-tapping of my new arthropod stalker on the various windows of the office. I refused to acknowledge her either.

Stretching my aching muscles, I headed to Charlie‚Äôs office to tell him he had gotten his slave labor out of me for the day.

I peered around the corner and knocked lightly on the door jamb to his office.

‚ÄúHey, I finished the revision. I‚Äôm headed out.‚Äù

*So help me god if he tells me to do one more thing-*

‚ÄúHold up there a second, me-boy. Have a seat.‚Äù

*God. Dammit.*

I dropped into the chair opposite him with an irritated *humph*.

‚ÄúWe need to talk about your performance lately.‚Äù

*Grand.*

‚ÄúYour work has been slipping for months, Stevie. You have been making more and more mistakes. And don‚Äôt get me started on that surly attitude you‚Äôve adopted!‚Äù

*I‚Äôll fucking show you surly.*

I stared vacantly as the steaming cup of coffee in his ‚ÄòWorld‚Äôs Best Boss‚Äô mug. He took a conservative sip and continued.

‚ÄúThis nasty Jones account business is just the most recent issue. We both know it isn‚Äôt the first though, don‚Äôt we? You want to tell me what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

*Tap-Tap.* A shimmer of blue-green in the window just visible in the dying light. Her head titled to one side, eyes boring into my soul.

‚Äú**-.- .. .-.. .-..¬† ‚Ä¶. .. --¬† ‚Ä¶ - . ‚Ä¶- . -.**‚Äù She tapped rapidly.

*Kill him, Steven.*

I took in a deep breath. Made a decision.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on is that you are a raging piece of shit.‚Äù I finally looked him in his fecal-brown eyes as they widened in shock. ‚ÄúWorking for you is the most miserable thing I have ever done. It makes me want to suck off a shotgun barrel every time I think about it. I wish your mother had aborted you, you useless waste of space.‚Äù A large grin spread across my face manically as I took in his stupefied visage.

‚ÄúWell! Now‚Ä¶ you just can‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù Charlie blustered.

I laughed at the look of consternation and rage that was turning his face red.

**-.- .. .-.. .-..¬† ‚Ä¶. .. --¬† ‚Ä¶ - . ‚Ä¶- . -.**

‚ÄúCome on, Charlie-boy! You self-righteous fuck. You just going to sit there and take it!?‚Äù I was out of my chair now, standing tall and proud for the first time in months. I was hitting my stride.

‚ÄúI hope you get rectal cancer. How about that one? Oh! Oh! How about this!? I hope your daughter gets leukemia. No? I HOPE YOUR DOG GETS HIT BY A FUCKING CAR!‚Äù I shouted into his face, savoring the flavor of every word, leaning over his desk at him. ¬†

Charlie was turning a lovely shade of purple by this point.

**-.- .. .-.. .-..¬† ‚Ä¶. .. --¬† ‚Ä¶ - . ‚Ä¶- . -.**

I will admit the punch threw me off guard. One second, he was sitting there, empurpling, the next his right fist was connecting with my jaw. Bursts of light shot across my vision. I flinched back from him.

‚ÄúYou fucking punched me!‚Äù I shrieked in shock.

**-.- .. .-.. .-..¬† ‚Ä¶. .. --¬† ‚Ä¶ - . ‚Ä¶- . -.**

It seemed the most natural reaction. What else was I going to do with a situation that had spiraled so drastically out of control? I flung the scalding contents of his conveniently placed mug directly into his face. Steaming coffee went into his eyes and burned violent red across his face. His screams of pain sounded so beautiful.

**-.- .. .-.. .-..¬† ‚Ä¶. .. --¬† ‚Ä¶ - . ‚Ä¶- . -.**

After hearing those fascinating, wondrous noises I didn‚Äôt want them to stop. I hurtled the desk, ‚ÄòWorld‚Äôs Best Boss‚Äô mug still in hand and hit him in the top of the head with it. His squeak of pain and the reverberation of the impact up my arm was so satisfying that I began smashing the mug over and over again against his greasy pate, bits of blood, hair, and porcelain shooting around the office.

**-.- .. .-.. .-..¬† ‚Ä¶. .. --¬† ‚Ä¶ - . ‚Ä¶- . -.**

Laughing in cathartic release, I continued beating him until I realized the handle of the mug was all that I was still holding, the rest having shattered into so much bloody confetti. Charlie was sliding from his chair onto the floor, gasping raggedly.

**-.- .. .-.. .-..¬† ‚Ä¶. .. --¬† ‚Ä¶ - . ‚Ä¶- . -.**

Not ready for this experience to end, I began kicking him in the ribs as I frantically looked for more things to hit him with. The glint of steel on his desk caught my eye. A glittering letter opener. Opulent and pretentious. I paused. A worm of indecision wriggling in my frontal cortex as Charlie‚Äôs foot twitched against my shin.

**-.- .. .-.. .-..¬† ‚Ä¶. .. --¬† ‚Ä¶ - . ‚Ä¶- . -.**

Picking up the letter opener and looking at my grinning, crazed, blood-speckled reflection in the gleaming steel; the worm squished beneath the weight of my momentum.

**-.- .. .-.. .-..¬† ‚Ä¶. .. --¬† ‚Ä¶ - . ‚Ä¶- . -.**

Plunging the letter opener over and over again into his torso. Stygian arterial blood sprayed back at me, spattering my face and neck liberally.

**-.- .. .-.. .-..¬† ‚Ä¶. .. --¬† ‚Ä¶ - . ‚Ä¶- . -.**

Squelching, piercing, sucking noises as it repeated entered his corpulent flesh.

**-.- .. .-.. .-..¬† ‚Ä¶. .. --¬† ‚Ä¶ - . ‚Ä¶- . -.**

She was there, sitting on his desk now, arms raised in a ‚ÄòV‚Äô of victory, wobbling back and forth like a little drunken goddess. I grin at her wildly. We look in unison to appreciate my creation.

Visible layers of crimson muscle and oil-slicked fat weep lymph and blood. A purple-grey loop of intestine peeks out of one particularly large incision. His eyes are half-closed, looking different directions. Spittle dribbles from the corner of his mouth.

The letter opener slipped from my hand, bouncing on the sodden carpet.

She bobbed up and down in place, delighted.

‚ÄúOh, fuck.‚Äù Panic was beginning to encroach on the edges of my mind, bubbling up my throat.

She began tapping on the desk, pulling my attention from the pulpy mess of Charlie in the carpet.

I'm a Hopeless Romantic looking for an emotional connection with someone I can call my best friend, my family, my life partner and everything. Someone who understands me, completes me, makes me feel loved, cared for and whole.

Someone I can laugh with, have deep conversations with and care so much about in this whole world as if she is the only person that matters.

I'm a Simple man who treasures every moment of his life. I love Humor, watching wrestling, football, movies, shows, listening to music and going out to enjoy the weather and get a good meal at a good restaurant or a coffee.

When I get time, I like writing my own original songs and stories, make YouTube videos or work on my future Business ideas.

I'm a Muslim by faith but Spiritual. I believe religion. Is one's own personal connection to God so it's just your heart that matters to me. 

If your love is as deep as the ocean and as bright as the stars and eyes that a man can drown in. If your words and conversations provide comfort to my soul and your touch heals my soul, what more can I ask for? That's the woman I want to settle down with.

1maxv5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1maxv5t/is_there_a_career_that_balances_ambition_travel/,"Is There a Career That Balances Ambition, Travel, and Work-Life Balance?","Hi everyone! Feel free to skip to the questions at the bottom if you don‚Äôt want to read the whole thing.

I am a recent (well, not that recent) college grad feeling a little lost in life and still in the thick of job applications. I graduated last December with a BBA in Finance.¬†My original plan was law school, but after studying for the LSAT and falling short of my target score, I decided to shift gears and¬†look for¬†a job instead.

My resume¬†has¬†a high GPA (mid-3.9s) and a decent extracurricular background (not naming specifics¬†for privacy), but my biggest weakness has been the lack of an internship.¬†I have worked with my school's career center to refine my resume, but so far, the job search has been disappointing. I have realized that many of the roles I initially targeted were in Investment Banking or other prestige-heavy fields, but I did not attend a target school.¬†So¬†part¬†of my struggle may be that I need to reframe my career preferences, which is really the point of this post.

After a recent family trip to Europe, I was¬†honestly amazed¬†by the work-life balance many Europeans seem to enjoy.¬†Just being in a new environment helped improve my mental health. That experience made me start thinking more seriously about finding jobs with generous PTO.¬†One of my main frustrations with U.S. work culture is the¬†lack of¬†paid vacation compared to other countries.¬†I worry that being stuck in one place,¬†following the same routine every day,¬†will wear me down mentally.¬†At the same time, I¬†worry¬†that asking for too much time off will hurt my career progression, and I do consider myself an ambitious person who is feeling a little directionless right now. (Honestly, I would even consider going into politics to push for expanded PTO, though right now, I am in no position to do so.)

Lately, I have been toying with the idea of applying to a top British master's program (Oxford, Cambridge, LSE, etc.) in hopes of eventually landing a job in Europe. I still have to research this more, but I am curious whether European careers offer a better balance between ambition and downtime. Plus, being based in a city like London would give me quick access to the rest of Europe, and I would love to visit every EU country someday.

I have also been wondering about business travel. I know business trips are¬†not the same as¬†leisure trips, but I am wondering whether a travel-intensive role could be a good fit for me. I grew up in a boring city where most people stay put (with the childhood trauma of being bullied), and I often felt stuck and uninspired. That European vacation was a much-needed recharge, and honestly, my biggest fear is ending up in a job that keeps me tied to one place. I noticed even in college that I was more productive when I changed up my environment, such as switching coffee shops every day.¬†I also genuinely love flying and being in airports (minus security checkpoints, I know I am a slight weirdo for these interests in airports and planes), and the¬†idea of earning airline points while traveling for work is¬†kind of¬†appealing.¬†It feels like it could help me save up for future personal trips.¬†I am someone who wants to explore as many countries as¬†I can, and I am a huge¬†foodie.

Right now, I realize a lot of this is coming from an idealistic place.¬†But your input could¬†really¬†help me focus my job search and get a better sense of direction.

Here are my main questions:

1. What career paths or job types should I consider that balance ambition and generous PTO? (I have found that having breaks¬†actually¬†helps my productivity.)
2. Are there specific companies or types of companies I should¬†be looking¬†into?
3. What are your thoughts on applying to European grad schools? Am I totally off-base for thinking this way?
4. Do you think international business travel is¬†right¬†for my personality, or am I setting myself up for disappointment?
5. What careers or companies frequently send employees on international trips (besides McKinsey or BCG)?
6. And most importantly: What's your advice for breaking into these kinds of roles?

Would love your input!,"Been lurking here for a while and I‚Äôm hesitant to put another ‚Äúrate my itinerary‚Äù post out here, but would love your input if you‚Äôd be so kind as to weigh in:

Day 1 - Friday:
- Arrive at hotel in Ueno at 5PM
- Explore Ameyoko Market, get dinner nearby, crash.

Day 2 - Saturday:
- Morning: Walk Ueno park through to Yanaka Ginza (skipping the zoo.)
- Afternoon: Explore Yanaka Ginza, get lunch.
- Evening: Hop on the train to Akihabara: explore Akiba (arcades, shops, super potato, etc), get dinner, then crash back in Ueno.

Day 3 - Sunday:
- Morning: Head to Shibuya - Coffee/Light breakfast at Shibuya Sky. Check out Tower Records and Pok√©mon Center in Shibuya.
- Afternoon: Pop into Harajuku for lunch and light shopping.
- Evening: Walk/Explore Meiji Jingu shrine/park heading north to end up in Kabukicho to hop a few bars in Golden Gai.

Day 4 - Monday:
- Morning/Early Afternoon: Hop on the train to Mt. Takao. Hike a little bit, explore a little bit, find a shrine and cafe?
- Afternoon/Evening: Train (taxi if exhausted) back to Ueno & hotel - *Free time/Rest.*

Day 5 - Tuesday:
- Morning/Afternoon: Disney! Partner is a huge Disney fan so this is a must. Either Tokyo Disneyland OR DisneySea (not sure which yet - definitely not both!)
- Evening: Train back to Ueno & hotel - *Free time/Rest.*

Day 6 - Wednesday:
- Morning: Tokyo National Museum - our hotel is *very* close, so I figure we can arrive when it opens and get out fill by noon.
- Afternoon: Head to Ginza, store our luggage at the station for a couple hours, explore a bit of Ginza (mostly for lunch), check out Nissan Crossing in Ginza (big car guy here, wanna check this out and it looks nearby and quick.)
- Evening: Pick our luggage at Tokyo Station in Ginza and hop on a 4PM Shinkansen to Kyoto.

That‚Äôs it! Naturally it isn‚Äôt our full trip - we have 3 days in Kyoto after this, then we‚Äôll head back to Narita for a final day after that where I booked a Ryokan near Narita‚Äôs historic market (not far from the airport, either) to unwind for our final day.

What are your thoughts - specifically on our Tokyo itinerary? I tried not to over schedule each day, build in a couple afternoons/evenings with free time, and map it out so we aren‚Äôt running all over the city or burning too much time on transit or super long walks. 

Day 3 is probably my biggest concern, where I‚Äôd want to take sizable bites out of Shibuya, Harajuku, AND Golden Gai all in one day (though the rest of Shinkuku isn‚Äôt really a priority for me.) But they‚Äôre all so near each other, in addition to Meiji Jingu, that it seems natural to tackle them together.

Personally I‚Äôd have skipped Disney unless we had more time in Tokyo but my partner insists (though I‚Äôm admittedly into it as well.) Plus if I have some energy during our free time/rest periods we could revisit Shibuya, check out Asakusa, or something else? Or just recharge.

This isn‚Äôt our first time overseas but it‚Äôs our first time in Japan. Thoughts? Too much? Well balanced? Recommendations?

Thanks a ton in advance!

1maxp8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Voicesofthevoid/comments/1maxp8s/critique_after_my_first_full_playthrough/,"Critique after my first ""full"" Playthrough","With ""full"" I mean I experienced all the of the 48 days of story content, cleaned up the base, created Kerfur Omega and got myself a full upgraded Rig.

**Summary**

I really like the game. It's a great job simulator, like Truck Simulator, where you follow a routine. While the gameplay loop is good, the survival aspect needs to be more involved and the story and QoL stuff need some work. I look forward to future updates and hope the various survival mechanics introduced actually become useful.

**Gameplay**

The Gameplay loop is pretty great, but not without flaws. It consists of four parts:

1. General physical survival of Food and Stamina management.
2. Download and Processing of Signals
3. Maintenance of Servers and Transformers in addition to sending daily Hash Codes.
4. Dealing with the random BS the game throws at you.

Number 1 is genuinely way too easy. The daily MRE delivery alongside existing food stocks makes it very easy to subsist. You need marginal extra deliveries of food to survive. While I did some cooking because I wanted to try it out, the vast majority of my food purchases were Shrimps for the Arirals, whom I fed full Bonus payments worth of. Cooking is fun, but both very optional and a single cooking session will last you an entire week in addition to MREs. Stamina management is also not anything to talk about. Just go to sleep, and if you have bought Coffee, occasionally drink that. Most strategy comes in with tactical shitting. While low on Stamina, wake up every hour to go to the toilet, like a senior with an irritable bowel.

What I'd like to see in the game (even if it's an optional rule) is some kind of restriction in terms of food delivery, maybe even delivery in general. Let's ignore that in Switzerland, nothing is really remote, but I can buy that it will take some time to source and pack the appropriate goods. Maybe organisational rules can be put in place that state that orders are only submitted once or twice a week, I have had such rules while working in a lab. In the later story food delivery could break down, or food increasingly is delivered spoiled, so something to encourage the player to branch out to fishing, gardening or cannibalism, or to properly stock up for potentially lean times.

Number 2 weaves into issues with Number 1. Your day job is to collect and process signals. It's your main and sustained source of revenue. This revenue can easily be converted into means to deal with #1. It's not a case of needing to go out of your way to survive, while trying to accomplish another task. So even if you go with the more difficult Daily Task setting, it does not really change the equation. If you go by the minimum requirements, you'll just spend some more time doing Computer tasks, with the additional reward making #1 easier.

For Number 3, let me pull out the controversial statements. Kerfur is just not that good for what it costs. 500 Credits for a machine that goes to fix servers sounds good in isolation, but for a similar amount of money you can get up to Level 11 (455 Points) or Level 12 (520 Points) in Server Stability. For 300 Points extra you can get it to Level 16, which means that singular Server outages are like every three days and those will often be in Alpha Base itself. I purchased Kerfur pretty late into the game as I instead focussed on Server Stability, which I don't regret. While it was nice to not have to go out to a satellite array in the dark, the vast majority of the time Kerfur was charging and inactive. 

Kerfur Omega was also a disappointment. While it can do a lot of tasks, if you play smart, you don't need it, unironically. Mine somehow disappeared from the surface of the Earth (I still don't know where it is). It's most useful for the daily report, but it cannot maintain Transformers that aren't down. This is important because I generally combine Report Trips with checking Transformers. The time savings disappear when you still have to worry about Transformers. A power outage is just so annoying compared to a server outage. In my case specifically, I also had a fully equipped Rig hooked up to the electricity net for a decent amount of time. You are heavily encouraged to check Transformers at least every two days. Even after hooking it up the generator I was still going to the Transformers every two days out of habit.

Random bullshit meanwhile is fun. Having to restart the power in the middle of the night or being woken up is great. Needing Molotovs for an impromptu Winter War against the Grays is also memorable.

**Story**

The story so far is interesting, even if it is kind of aimless. The idea of someone being at the nexus of paranormal and alien activity is good. However, there are issues. The human component fizzles out as time progresses. The occasional email exclaiming ""that's crazy"" doesn't do anything. The alien component has aspects of ""and then"" stories. Kel currently lacks agency. In a way, it feels like Kel is an extra during a Godzilla film. This can work, but at the same time I find it lacking. In a game there can only be so many cutscenes, where both the player and player character have no input until it becomes a farce to play. I hope this improves in future updates.",2,1753650668.0,Voicesofthevoid,0,1.0,False

Now it's the same playbook. Suddenly, she‚Äôs pretending to care about Palestine and mind you, she only started speaking up now, just because more celebrities are doing a 180 and showing support. She was silent for months when tensions between the U.S., Israel, and Palestine were high. Not a word.

Club Cienciano, meanwhile, are the mystery team.

Don‚Äôt bother with panda bears unless you‚Äôre making like 6 million + per year. Always brings your profits way down, no idea why. If you don‚Äôt believe me, start a new zoo and get pandas. No idea why 

Elephants are harder to breed when you‚Äôve got a bigger zoo. If you want elephants, have them at least be the first animal in their enclosure

Attractions to have:

Small zoo: carousel, zip line, one of catlife/dog life garden

Medium: all of the above (both gardens) + wildlife conservation centre

Large: all of the above and the following attractions at their LOWEST entry fees: rope course, tram, 4D theatre 

Staffing levels:

Small: 3 cleaning, 1 customer, 6 security

Medium: 6 cleaning, 2 customer, 12 security

Large: 15 cleaning, 5 customer, 20 security 

Items in gift shop

Small: keychains, posters, postcards + water bottles at their lowest price 

Medium: all of the above, + coffee mugs at lowest price and T-shirts at a medium ish price (so less than what they suggest, but not the lowest)

Large: never sold out of anything else so just pick whatever you fancy 

Only put items in gift shop for rare animals

Avoid Tapirs, they need euthanising literally every other year. Swine flu 

Birds are great to have because they can‚Äôt catch diseases that require them to be euthanised. The birds that live the longest are any parrots, scarlet macaws and normal macaws, but there‚Äôs loads that live to 40+. 

If you want lions or tigers, pair them with zebras and hippos. Nobody gets killed

Other pairings for say eagles and flamingos or tortoises and alligators don‚Äôt really matter because it‚Äôs not that common they‚Äôll be killed. Maybe 1 per life time

Have 5 of each animal, at least 2 of each gender, when one dies, breed/purchase another

I personally don‚Äôt bother with desert or nocturnal enclosures because the animals don‚Äôt live too long and I find them boring, instead I have 2x savanna and aviaries but it‚Äôs just preference

When starting the zoo, get animals that live the longest first. Elephants, tortoises, most birds, alligators, primates etc etc 

Walruses, seals and sea lions are quite prone to having diseases that require euthanasia. I‚Äôd recommend only having 1 of these species. Snakes and primates are too, but it‚Äôs not as common. ",1,1753650109.0,BitLifeApp,0,1.0,False

### Parsing the Odds: Why Leicester Feels Like a Foregone Conclusion

Leicester‚Äôs odds scream ‚Äú*we‚Äôve seen this movie before*.‚Äù Since their 2020-21 Championship title win, the Foxes have been a model of consistency, blending shrewd transfers with a defensive grit that makes their stadium feel like a vault. Sheffield Wednesday, meanwhile, are the sports equivalent of a ‚Äúmystery box‚Äù at a yard sale‚Äîfull of hope but mostly empty. Their 8.5 odds imply they‚Äôre about as likely to win as a vegan at a barbecue contest.

The spread? Leicester‚Äôs -1.5 line (1.91 odds) suggests they‚Äôll win by *at least two goals*, while the total goalsline (2.75, Over 1.83 / Under 2.0) hints at a high-scoring affair. If this were a Netflix series, it‚Äôd be titled *‚ÄúLeicester‚Äôs Revenge‚Äù*‚ÄîSeason 4, Episode 117.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Manchester City vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers: A Tale of Shepherds and Sheep (With a Lot of Goals)**

The 2025-26 Premier League opener pits Manchester City against Wolverhampton Wanderers on August 16, and if the odds are any indication, this will be less of a football match and more of a math test. Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a pub quiz host who‚Äôs had one too many pints.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Wolves Should Bring a Translator

The bookmakers are practically handing Manchester City the trophy before kickoff. City‚Äôs odds range from **1.43 to 1.48**, implying a **67-70% chance of victory**. Wolverhampton? They‚Äôre priced between **5.4 and 6.5**, which means bookies think they‚Äôll win **15-18% of the time**‚Äîabout the same chance you‚Äôd give a sheep in a wolf costume trying to bluff its way into a pack. The draw sits at **4.5 to 4.75**, translating to a **20-22% chance**, which is generous if you‚Äôve ever seen City‚Äôs attack in full flow.

The spread? City‚Äôs -1.25 goals, per most books. Wolves would need to stay within a goal *and* gift City a own-net entr√©e to cover. Meanwhile, the over/under is **2.5-3.0 goals**, with the over favored. If you‚Äôre betting on ‚ÄúUnder,‚Äù bring a parachute.

### News Digest: New Hair, New Challenges

**Manchester City** are coming off a third-place finish, which is like being the third-best chef in a kitchen full of Michelin stars‚Äîrespectable, but you‚Äôre still making the coffee. Manager Pep Guardiola has embraced a *very* 2025 aesthetic: shaved head, trimmed beard, and presumably a new confidence that his players can finally win the Champions League. The team‚Äôs pre-season includes a friendly against Palermo, which is less ‚Äútest match‚Äù and more ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see if Jo√£o Cancelo can score with his elbow.‚Äù

**Wolverhampton**, meanwhile, are the Premier League‚Äôs version of a pop-up tent at a motorhome festival‚Äîcompetent, but not exactly built for a storm. They have no major injury updates (yet),

We obviously started off young and with that came all the trials. We have 2 teenage daughter (17&18). My husband and I really do love each-other, best friends, we live life loud and have a lot of fun together, being an empty nester with him doesn‚Äôt scare me. 

With that. He has had some ‚Äúminor‚Äù moments of infidelity. Sexting, snap chat, photos with women I know. I had left him at one point when our girls were very little but obviously took him back, did the therapy. He had a rough childhood and a bit of a military career, when he hit lows he reached out for ego stroking is how i take it. It was never love, if anything I felt bad for the women he was so disrespectful and using them. 

Anyways it‚Äôs been over 3 years and hes had no issues of infidelity from what I can see and sense, but the last one was while we were married and REALLY broke my heart, felt like serious betrayal. Things have been pretty solid since, BUT I can‚Äôt find peace. His moods can be so angry with pressures of life, while I too feel the same pressures I just handle it better (positive perspective). We both work full time, I‚Äôm a nurse, I actually may even make a bit more than him financially, yet he consistently gives me a hard time about $. I‚Äôm fairly low maintenance (take care of myself naturally and stay in shape, make my own coffee, no nail & hair maintenance, no designer bags, every so often I buy a plant or new hand towels). Equally he‚Äôs super handy takes care of car and house issues. 

The issue. I don‚Äôt feel safe to speak to him. He gives me grief, I stick up for myself and it‚Äôs this back and forth battle and spirals. 

I recently went back on FB after about a decade hiatus, I just notice a lady and some photos of her he likes. He makes it clear he‚Äôs married on his profile. I simply asked who she was and how he knows her. Off the handle he goes, I admitted it made me insecure, and I just needed some reassurance there was nothing to worry about. He deletes her even though I said he didn‚Äôt need to nor did I ask him to. 

This is a small example, it‚Äôs stuff like this where anytime I bring up my feelings or insecurities (brought on by him) he deflects, gets on me about something senseless, says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ask you about your friends!‚Äù Ok sure but I don‚Äôt send out red flags, I didn‚Äôt cheat in this marriage, and by all means ask I‚Äôd happily answer. 

I have told him I harbor resentment and I hate that. I‚Äôve told him I trust him but when issues arise I need to feel safe to speak to him. I‚Äôve asked him to respect me financially and see my value and how hard I work. He says the right things, eventually, but not after a day or a few of tension. 

So nutshell here. I truly do want him to come around, I want our next 40+ years to level the heck up! Potential is everywhere. I just don‚Äôt feel peace in this home even though I consistently have a smile plastered on my face. 

Therapy, he‚Äôs not bored anymore.

So all I can feel is a true trial separation where I leave. He has too much work equipment at our house and a family member of his living in our guest room. I feel like I could find my peace in my own space, close to nature walks, close to work, get my girls to stay sometimes (they would be 100% on bored, they have mentioned many times I deserve better‚Ä¶that‚Äôs so heart breaking to hear as a mom from your daughters about their dad, when all I ever did was try to keep this intact family). He‚Äôs a good dad, his anger energy just omits through the house‚Ä¶.though he says he‚Äôs not angry just frustrated ect‚Ä¶

So could this work? With ground rules. No dating, still helping each-other with the kids and finances, check ins as needed. I just want this space for healing and reflection, I want him to recognize what I bring to the table and I‚Äôm not asking for much. I want him to reflect and heal in his own way‚Ä¶.or not‚Ä¶I just want a clarity.

While doing it I already feel awful and after the guilt sets in. Rationally it's things that wouldn't be cheating. (such as making a heart in the coffee of a customer when they are old. I work as a barista.) What bothers me is that I still choose to go through with it while on the mindset of cheating and then it feels like I did.

This also sometimes happens with other things my OCD latches on. And I always feel awful about them. I have ADHD and my guess is that I struggle with impulsivity but I also don't understand why I'd do something when I know I'll feel awful before I do it and while I do it and it doesn't follow my standards. There's also no real reward in it most of the time unless it's related to doing something nice to a co-worker or friend that ends up being categorised as cheating or flirting.

I have no clue why I do it I fully love my partner more than anything and I would never want to actually cheat on him but all of this is making me think that I would. I have made some bad decisions in the past and still feel awful for them to this day which is where the cheating OCD started from.

Alias: Mr. Mondro

Birthday: November 20, 1995

Age: 30

Race: Elf Tribe

Role: The Clown Host / Antagonist / 
Performer / Mysterious Being

üé≠ Backstory:

Mr. Mondro was once a celebrated and beloved clown host, traveling with his circus and entertaining people with laughter, wonder, and unforgettable performances. Alongside his crew ‚Äî Shinobie, Chiena, and Reno‚Äôs ‚Äî he brought joy across the Apex World. But as time passed, his heart grew empty, unsatisfied with ordinary acts. He yearned for a ""perfect performance"" ‚Äî something eternal, breathtaking, and legendary.
When he met Dara, he saw that potential. Her psychic and demonic Kitsune powers could be the missing spark in his show. But when she refused to join him, something in Mondro snapped. That rejection triggered a slow spiral into madness and obsession with control, leading him down the path of villainy.
During the battle with J, Stripes, and Aishen in Chapter 2, Mondro was defeated and presumed dead ‚Äî but thanks to a hidden backup bow tie, he regenerated. His return was shocking, terrifying‚Ä¶ and oddly elegant. He remains one of the most unpredictable and scariest villains in the Apex Universe.

* Mysterious and theatrical
* Laughs a lot, with scrappy voice
* Eyes always smiling ‚Äî has no visible mouth

üíò Love Interest:

* Marceline, however, just sees him as ‚Äúprey‚Äù ‚Äî but that hasn‚Äôt stopped Mr. Mondro from trying to impress her. Their dynamic is chaotic, hilarious, and slightly romantic in a weird way.

üë• Friends:

* Dara ‚Äì He feels guilty for trying to use her. After his resurrection, they form a strange but respectful friendship.
* 
* J ‚Äì After being forgiven, they become low-key allies, and J sees some good in him.

‚ùå Enemies:

They‚Äôre playing us like pawns, and we‚Äôre eating it up. You‚Äôve heard it: ‚ÄúIf voting made a difference, they wouldn‚Äôt let us do it.‚Äù Damn right. The 2024 election had 70% turnout, yet $14B in Israel aid and endless wars roll on. Democracy‚Äôs a circus, and we‚Äôre the clowns.
Look at X and Reddit‚Äîflooded with posts about Israel‚Äôs Gaza war (43,000+ dead, per CNN), Trump‚Äôs Epstein jet logs (2025 DOJ files), and ‚Äúclass not culture‚Äù war cries. It‚Äôs too loud. Why are elite-owned platforms (Musk‚Äôs X, Tencent‚Äôs Reddit) letting us see this? Because it‚Äôs a distraction, folks. They want us raging about pedos and genocide while they sneak in the real plan: CBDCs, AI surveillance, and BlackRock‚Äôs global takeover.
The Pattern: The cabal‚Äîglobalist elites like BlackRock‚Äôs Larry Fink‚Äîcontrol the narrative. They amplify divisive stuff (Israel‚Äôs war, Epstein‚Äôs ‚Äúlist‚Äù) to keep us fighting online instead of acting. X posts like #EpsteinFiles (1.2M in July 2025) and #ClassWar (500k posts) feel woke, but they‚Äôre bait. Voting? A pacifier to keep us docile. The real game is a tech-driven power grab.
What They‚Äôre Hiding:
CBDCs: The Fed‚Äôs 2024 digital dollar pilot is the start. X users like @scopesatoshi (July 2025) claim BlackRock‚Äôs Aladdin AI ($21T in assets) is prepping CBDCs to track every transaction. Catherine Austin Fitts on Decentralize TV (July 2025) says Trump and BlackRock want dollar-pegged stablecoins to replace global currencies, delaying a dollar crash while locking us into ‚Äúdigital slavery.‚Äù No privacy, no freedom.
AI Surveillance: BlackRock‚Äôs ‚ÄúAsimov‚Äù AI (Bloomberg, June 2025) and Aladdin platform predict markets and behavior. X post by @ChrisJo00291974 calls BlackRock a ‚Äúpuppet master‚Äù surveilling markets. France‚Äôs 2024 Olympics used AI analytics to monitor crowds (CryptoSlate, Oct 2024). This is 1984 on steroids‚Äîcabal tracks us while we‚Äôre busy tweeting.
BlackRock‚Äôs Grip: With $10T in assets, BlackRock‚Äôs buying everything‚Äîreal estate, stocks‚Äîwhile inflation (6% in 2025, IMF) screws us. Their AI Infrastructure Partnership with Microsoft, NVIDIA, and xAI (March 2025) is sinking $100B into AI data centers and power grids, locking in tech dominance. Larry Fink calls it ‚Äúeconomic growth‚Äù; X users like @badmofo777Liber say it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúTrojan horse‚Äù for control.
Why It Works: We‚Äôre comfy venting on X and Reddit, but nobody‚Äôs storming the streets. They let us see Epstein‚Äôs dirt (Trump‚Äôs name in files) and Gaza‚Äôs horrors because it keeps us divided‚Äîleft vs. right, rich vs. poor. Meanwhile, CBDCs and AI surveillance roll out, and BlackRock buys the world. Fischer was right about elite control, just wrong about the players.
The Endgame: By 2030, they want a technocratic hell‚ÄîCBDCs tracking your coffee run, AI watching your every move, BlackRock owning your house. We‚Äôre too busy roasting Trump to notice. Prove me wrong: what‚Äôs the real play here? Drop your thoughts or evidence below. Let‚Äôs wake up before it‚Äôs too late.

1max8im,https://www.reddit.com/r/StraightupNature/comments/1max8im/feeding_the_earth_the_simple_power_of_compost_in/,Feeding the Earth: The Simple Power of Compost in Your Garden,"Compost is nature‚Äôs way of recycling‚Äîtransforming everyday organic waste into rich, fertile soil that helps plants thrive. Whether you're a backyard gardener, a balcony planter, or someone just looking to reduce waste, composting is one of the most practical, rewarding things you can do for your plants and the planet.

# What Is Compost?

Compost is decomposed organic matter. It‚Äôs made from things like fruit and vegetable scraps, leaves, grass clippings, coffee grounds, eggshells, and other natural materials that break down over time with the help of bacteria, fungi, worms, and insects. The end result is dark, crumbly, earthy-smelling material often called ‚Äúblack gold‚Äù because of how valuable it is for soil health.

# Why Use Compost?

Compost improves almost every aspect of your garden:

* **Feeds your plants** with a slow release of nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
* **Improves soil structure**, helping sandy soil retain moisture and breaking up heavy clay soil so roots can breathe.
* **Boosts microbial activity**, which keeps your soil alive and balanced.
* **Helps with moisture retention**, meaning you water less.
* **Reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers** and improves long-term soil fertility.
* **Suppresses plant diseases** and even some pests, thanks to beneficial organisms in the compost.

Using compost isn‚Äôt just good for your garden‚Äîit also keeps food and yard waste out of landfills, reducing methane emissions and your overall environmental impact.

# What Does Compost Do for Plants and Soil?

Compost acts like a natural fertilizer and soil conditioner rolled into one. It:

* Encourages strong root growth.
* Balances pH in the soil.
* Increases aeration and drainage.
* Provides essential micronutrients often missing in commercial fertilizers.
* Supports a thriving ecosystem underground, including helpful microbes, worms, and fungi.

The improved soil biology helps plants become more resilient to stress, disease, and inconsistent watering.

# When and How to Use Compost

**When to use it:**

* **Spring and fall** are ideal times to apply compost, but it can be used year-round.
* Use it before planting, during the growing season as a mulch or top dressing, or mixed into potting soil.

**How to use it:**

* **In garden beds:** Work 1‚Äì2 inches of compost into the top few inches of soil before planting.
* **As a top dressing:** Sprinkle around established plants and water it in.
* **In containers:** Mix compost with potting soil, up to about 25‚Äì30%.
* **For lawns:** A thin layer spread over grass in early spring can improve soil and boost growth.
* **As compost tea:** Steep compost in water to create a nutrient-rich liquid for feeding plants.

# How to Make Your Own Compost

Making compost at home is easy once you get the hang of it. You need a mix of ‚Äúgreens‚Äù (nitrogen-rich materials) and ‚Äúbrowns‚Äù (carbon-rich materials).

**Greens (wet, nitrogen):**

* Fruit and veggie scraps
* Coffee grounds
* Grass clippings
* Tea bags

**Browns (dry, carbon):**

* Dried leaves
* Shredded paper or cardboard
* Straw
* Sawdust (from untreated wood)

**Basic tips:**

1. **Layer greens and browns** to keep the pile balanced.
2. **Turn it regularly** to add oxygen and speed up decomposition.
3. **Keep it moist** like a wrung-out sponge.
4. **Avoid meat, dairy, and oily foods** which attract pests and slow the process.

In a few months (longer in cold weather), you'll have crumbly, dark compost ready to enrich your soil.

# Final Thoughts

Compost is one of the simplest ways to support healthy soil, reduce waste, and grow more vibrant plants. Whether you buy it bagged or make your own, adding compost to your garden is like giving your soil a well-balanced meal. Feed the earth, and it will feed you back.

I‚Äôm working on a line of zero-sugar, syrups that bring dessert vibes plus functional benefits like collagen and vitamin C for skin health. The idea is you can add them to your Ninja Slushie drinks (or even coffee, tea, sparkling water) to make a tasty, guilt-free treat.

The first flavor I‚Äôm playing with is Strawberry Shortcake ‚Äî creamy, fruity, and nostalgic, designed to taste like a dessert without the sugar crash.

I‚Äôd love to know:

* Would you add something like this to your Ninja Slushie creations?
* Do you like syrups with real fruit bits or prefer a smooth texture?
* How important is it that the syrup needs to be refrigerated?
* What other flavors or benefits would you want in a syrup for your drinks?

1max70c,https://www.reddit.com/r/GestationalDiabetes/comments/1max70c/this_is_so_hard/,This is so hard.,"I‚Äôve been having a really difficult and discouraging last few days. I‚Äôm 32, almost 33 weeks pregnant. Diagnosed at 28 weeks. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs only been a few weeks since I‚Äôve been diagnosed, because it feels like a lifetime. Everyday feels like a lifetime with GD for me personally. But anyway, what I need to vent about right now is the last couple of days. My husband and I have a friend staying with us right now, and it‚Äôs been so hard having to watch them indulge in whatever they want while I just sit and watch and have to eat a very different diet than them. Last night we went out for a seafood boil with some other friends. I was on such a high because I could actually eat the seafood boil - so much protein, a bunch of broccoli in a buttery sauce (no sugar added, I checked), and I felt included and a part of the group. I could indulge in something with them and I was so happy. But then immediately after one of our friends suggested we go get ice cream (my number one pregnancy craving that I can‚Äôt have). So I had to sit there while they all enjoyed their ice cream. I ended up going to the car to sit by myself and cry. I came crashing down after the high I was on, feeling so isolated and alone. And feeling sorry for myself, which I HATE. This morning, my husband, our friend and I decided to go out for coffee and some thrift shopping. My husband and friend decided to stop and get pastries first (obviously can‚Äôt eat that) so I went ahead by myself to the coffee shop. Waited in line just to find out there was no almond milk, only regular milk and oat (which is a big GD no no). I ended up walking out of the coffee shop empty handed and walked to ANOTHER coffee shop down the street, just to again find out there was no almond milk. So I ended up getting a plain black iced coffee and a splash of half and half (not at all what I actually want), and walked out and cried and cried and cried, with my sunglasses on walking around the block so hopefully no one could see me. I felt like such a BABY. At the same time, feeling so sorry for myself that not only did the pregnant girl have to skip out on pastries, but then had to go to two different coffee shops just to get a drink that I didn‚Äôt even want. I feel so stupid for crying and getting emotional about it, it‚Äôs such first world problem. It just reminds me that I‚Äôm alone in this (at least within my own personal life and circle of people). Pregnancy itself often feels like an isolating experience for me, and this GD diagnosis has added a WHOLE new level to that feeling of isolation‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so hard. And I can‚Äôt expect the people in my life to NOT eat ice cream and pastries. Im not angry at them for this, it wouldn‚Äôt be fair. It‚Äôs just a very lonely experience that I have to face. So yeah, just wanted to vent so maybe I can feel like I‚Äôm not alone in this. Thanks for listening if you‚Äôve read all the way to the end. ",11,1753649392.0,GestationalDiabetes,8,0.87,False

Now it carried the tang of petrol and cordite. I‚Äôd watch Mother‚Äôs ears flatten against her skull every time the buzzing started, her tail lashing like an irritated cat‚Äôs as she kneaded dough. ""Devil‚Äôs wasps,"" she‚Äôd mutter, flour dusting her worn apron. 

The Valpour officers with their clipped moustaches and shiny boots had paid silver for our south pasture-""For the allies‚Äô sky machines,"" they‚Äôd said. 

We‚Äôd nodded dumbly, picturing maybe giant clockwork birds.



Then they broke the earth. mechanical shovel bit into the loam where Father had taught me to read cloud signs. When the first biplane tore the sky, its four wings shuddering in the slipstream, Mother dropped a clay jug. The whir of its engine vibrated in our chest bones. ""That! That racket day and night!"" she‚Äôd fume, scrubbing pots raw.



Captain Duval changed things. He arrived with apologies wrapped in brown paper‚Äîreal coffee, tinned peaches, a big piece of ham. His Frankonian accent softened the edges of his uniform. ""We regret the disturbance, Madame,"" he‚Äôd said, bowing slightly. Mother‚Äôs ears twitched upright, her tail stilling. She served him elderflower cordial in our best cup. The complaints grew quieter, muttered only to the hearth fire.



I was drawn to the airfield like a moth. Through the new barbed wire, I‚Äôd watch the canvas-coated aircraft leap into the air, their rotary engines screaming like banshees. Lucien, a mechanic with oil permanently etched under his nails, told me how they tangled with Albonite dragons over the Talamara. ""Imagine,"" he‚Äôd said, sketching flames in the air with a wrench, ""tons of teeth and scales against canvas and courage."" Canvas seemed a frail thing against dragonfire, though I pictured Father somewhere in the mud trenches, grateful for the canvas angels above.



Humans become a common sight in our fields during lulls. Pierre, barely older than me with a laugh too big for his slight frame, helped mend the sheep fence after a storm. Jean-Luc, whose hands shook slightly before a dawn patrol, showed me how the radio crackled to life with voices from across mountains. Their greatest magic was the light. Wires snaked up our cottage wall, and with a click, golden light bloomed from a glass pear hanging from the rafter. Mother touched the switch as if it were sacred, her eyes wide in the sudden, shadowless glow. ""Like bottled sunlight,"" she breathed.



Pierre snuck me past a drowsy guard once. The hangar smelled of dope, oil, and sweat. Biplanes rested like resting hawks, their fabric skin taut over delicate wooden bones. ""See the curve?"" Pierre whispered, tracing a wing‚Äôs arc. ""It bites the air, holds it like water in cupped hands."" It sounded like poetry, not physics. I nodded, understanding only the reverence in his touch.



The counting started unconsciously. Seven droning shapes climbing east at dawn. Six, sometimes five, limping home at dusk. One crisp autumn day, watching four specks return when five had left, I asked, ""Where‚Äôs Antoine today?"" Marcel, usually quick with a joke about engine trouble, looked like I‚Äôd struck him. His face, young beneath the goggles pushed up on his leather helmet, crumpled. ""He‚Ä¶ found a different sky, petite,"" he rasped, turning abruptly to polish a spotless wing strut. The silence that followed was heavier than engine noise.



Then the giants came.

Bulky, twin-engined monsters with wings like layered knives, dwarfing the sprightly fighters. They landed with a ground-shaking thrum that rattled our plates. Marcel came for cheese, shadows like bruises under his eyes, new silver wings gleaming on his tunic. ""Buying extra, petite,"" he winked, though the smile didn't reach his eyes. He leaned close, smelling of gasoline and nervous sweat. ""Big show soon. Very big. Maybe‚Ä¶ maybe the last."" He tapped his nose. ""Secret, yes? We'll crater the roosts. End this."" Hope, bright and terrifying, flared in my chest. I swore silence.



The day dawned brittle and clear. A sound like the world tearing apart shook the cottage as every machine ‚Äì fighters, bombers ‚Äì roared down the runway and clawed for the sky. Twenty-seven. I counted each one, whispering prayers into the frayed edge of my shawl, weaving clover stems into the fence.



They returned as shadows lengthened. Not in formation, but straggling, wounded beasts. Smoke trailed from shattered engines. Canvas hung in tattered ribbons. Ten‚Ä¶ twelve‚Ä¶ fifteen‚Ä¶ The gaps screamed louder than engines. Then came the deep, faltering groan of a bomber. One engine dead, the other spewing oily black plumes, it wavered like a dying hawk. It was too low, too slow, aiming right for our thatched roof.



""Run!"" Mother‚Äôs shriek tore my paralysis. We stumbled across the yard as the monstrous shadow blotted the sun. A rending crash of splintering wood, a shudder through the earth ‚Äì it missed the house by yards, shearing the top off the old pear tree before ploughing into the barley field behind the barn.



Flames licked the fuselage before we reached it. The stench ‚Äì burning fuel, scorched metal, and something sickly-sweet ‚Äì clawed at our throats. The rear section was a charnel house. Where the gunners sat, only mangled metal and dark stains remained. In the pilot‚Äôs seat, pinned by twisted controls, was Marcel.



His flight suit was fused to his chest in places. His face, beneath soot and blisters, was bone-white. One leg ended in a ragged mess below the knee, the cockpit floor glistening beneath him. ""H-help‚Ä¶"" bubbled through cracked lips. Mother and I pulled, screaming against his weight and the groaning metal. The heat seared our skin. We dragged him clear just as the remaining engine exploded with a dull whump, showering the field in burning debris.



He was shockingly light. We hauled him further, collapsing onto the churned earth. He trembled violently, his breath ragged gasps. Blood soaked the barley stalks beneath him. Mother cradled his head in her lap, her rough hands brushing ash from his forehead. ""You're alright now,"" she murmured, her voice thick. ""You're alright.""



""Cold‚Ä¶"" he whispered, his eyes wide but unseeing. ""S-so cold‚Ä¶"" Mother tore off her thick wool shawl, wrapping it around his shuddering shoulders. Crimson bloomed across the grey wool instantly. I stood frozen, the world reduced to his labored breathing and the roaring fire.



""Go! Fetch help! The airfield!"" Mother‚Äôs command was sharp, desperate. But my legs were stone. Marcel‚Äôs hand flailed, finding Mother‚Äôs arm. His glazed eyes focused on her face, seeing someone else.



""Ma‚Ä¶"" he breathed, a child‚Äôs whimper tearing from his ruined throat. ""It hurts‚Ä¶""



A single tear tracked through the grime on Mother‚Äôs cheek, then another. She bent lower, her voice breaking into a soft croon I hadn‚Äôt heard since I was small. ""Hush now‚Ä¶ hush‚Ä¶""



""Mama‚Ä¶"" His voice was fainter, a sigh lost in the crackle of flames. ""I...I want‚Ä¶ to go home‚Ä¶""



His body went slack. The frantic tremor ceased. Mother held him closer, rocking slightly, her face buried for a moment in his singed hair. Her shoulders shook silently.



Frankonian medics arrived with stretchers and fire buckets. They prised Marcel from Mother‚Äôs arms. One of them, his face grim, simply shook his head, closing Marcel‚Äôs vacant eyes with a gentle thumb. Mother stood slowly, her shawl a sodden crimson rag at her feet. She watched them carry him away, her ears perfectly still, her tail hanging limp.



The buzzing returned the next day. The fighters climbed, the bombers droned on and on. Mother stood at the clothesline, pinning up sheets. She didn‚Äôt flinch. She didn‚Äôt curse. She just pinned, her movements precise, her gaze fixed on the horizon where the smoke still smudged the sky above our barley field. She left one empty space on the line.



When the armistice bells finally rang across the valley weeks later, she was mending a scarf by the electric light Marcel‚Äôs friends had installed. She looked up at the glowing bulb, its steady, occasionally buzzing light pushing back the twilight, then back to her darning. She said nothing. The war was over. The whirring stopped. The silence in our cottage was deeper than any engine noise, filled only by the quiet click of her needle and the memory of a boy who‚Äôd wanted to go home.",15,1753649387.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

Thanks for reading üíõ

***Day one***¬†

Mama‚Äôs call caught me off guard, but not in a bad way.¬†

‚ÄúWe miss you,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúCome see about us.‚Äù¬†

It wasn‚Äôt like her to ask for anything‚Äînot since I moved in with Duke. I hadn't been gone that long, but it still felt like a minute. So, when she called, I just packed a bag and told Duke I‚Äôd be back in a few days. He kissed my forehead and helped me carry my suitcase to the car like he always did. Told me to call when I made it home. He called it home and for a second, that's where it felt I was going.¬†

By the time I hit the freeway, the sun was just starting to peek up over the buildings, all orange and gold like it had something to prove. The city always had a little magic in the morning‚Äîbuses trudging past, folks cussing each other out over parking spots, corner boys already posted up with a cigarette or a bottle of cheap liquor. That‚Äôs home, too. But the farther I drove, the more it melted behind me.¬†

All that steel and brick turned into long stretches of farmland and sleepy trees. Streetlights gave way to the open sky, and the air got thick and wet. It began to pour, and the rain really smelled like rain, but not the city kind. More like river water and dirt and flowers. Out here, everything is slow and deliberate. The marshes held secrets like a clock holds time.¬†

The wide-open road gave way to a small path of gravel and dirt road that led to my childhood home. Winding through the marshes; no signs, no neighbors for miles, just mud, and grass and trees for miles and miles. Huge dragonflies zipped past my windows. Swarms of gnats gathered and dispersed around the trees. About a quarter mile from the house, my father had nailed a pretty little sign to a tree. ‚ÄúThe Freeman Residence‚Äù it read in big white calligraphy, ‚ÄúAlways Blessed and Guided by the Hands of the Most High.‚Äù the letters were bold and eye catching. I used to think the quote was so tacky, ripped straight out of a southern Baptist prayer circle. I never remembered it being so...spooky.¬†

The house itself looked smaller than I remembered‚Äîshrunk by time, warped by weather. The roof sagged slightly in the middle, one shutter clung to the side of a window by a single rusted hinge. The siding, once a pale blue, had faded into a ghostly gray, stained by streaks of rust and mold.¬†

Wind chimes made from glimmering crystal clinked low on the porch. The front steps creaked under my weight, the wood soft and swollen from years of storms. A layer of pollen stuck to the railing like dust to bone. The porch swing was missing a chain, left crooked and swaying slightly in the still air.¬†

Walking up to the porch, the smell of fried chicken wafted through the front door. I felt warm with nervous feelings, as if I hadn‚Äôt called to tell them I was coming. I went to knock on the door but remembered how Momma usually kept it unlocked during the day. I tested the handle‚Äîit was open. I pulled down my skirt one last time and walked in.¬†

‚ÄúHello, family!‚Äù I had sung loud enough for my voice to echo back.¬†

‚ÄúLai‚Ä¶‚Äù my mother started. I could hear her fumbling quickly to put things down or away. ‚ÄúLaila!‚Äù she shouted, the clanking getting louder.¬†

I walked across the living room and toward the kitchen.¬†¬†

The house was heavy with silence.¬†

Every surface had a story: the dent in the wall from when Daddy tripped during one of his drunken escapades; the chipped corner of the coffee table where I knocked out a baby tooth.¬†

Everything was exactly how i left it. Same brown couch with the plastic clinging to it. Same crucifix with a tiny suffering black Jesus. Same fake ficus by the window that had somehow gathered more dust than leaves. The only thing different was me.¬†

I walked in and saw my mom frantically closing drawers, washing the fried chicken batter from her hands, and turning around with a dish towel in hand. She pulled me into her embrace without a word. She hugged me, squeezed, then pushed me back to take another look‚Äîand hugged me again.¬†

And for a second, I almost cried. Not because I missed her‚Äîbut because it felt like I was being hugged by someone wearing my mother‚Äôs skin. Too much love. Too sudden. Too warm. Like it was trying to cover something up.¬†¬†

I remember when I was little, id walked into the kitchen at maybe 3 in the morning. Mom was barefoot, in her floor-length moo moo, humming a gospel song and cooking up a storm.¬† The house was dark except for the dim, orange light over the stove. Glowing like a halo over her head. I told her I had a bad dream. ‚Äúthat's just the devil‚Äôs way of playing with you‚Äù she said. Playing with me? Why would I want to play with the devil? I thought.¬†¬†

‚ÄúAnd sometimes,‚Äù she said flipping a chicken leg over in the hot oil, ‚Äúhe plays with me too.‚Äù She took something wrapped in a napkin in her moo moo pocket. ‚ÄúThis is how we play.‚Äù She shook the napkin in her fists with a smile and winked at me, as if telling me to keep her secret.¬†

I didn't know what to say about this. I'm lost for words even now. I let out a small chuckle and pretended to zip my lips together and toss the key over my shoulder.¬†¬†

‚ÄúGood girl. My sweet, sweet girl. Now let's go tell the devil to let my baby sleep?‚Äù she said, grabbing my hand and leading me back to my room. I laid in bed for hours thinking about the devil. I'd forgotten that story completely until now.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWas the drive too bad? The roads down here just keep getting worse,‚Äù she said, staring into my eyes and leaning against the kitchen island. She‚Äôd been practically breathless with excitement. She stepped forward and brushed my braids off my shoulders.¬†

‚ÄúYou're so pretty.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThanks, Mommy.‚Äù I smiled. ‚ÄúThe drive was fine, but Big Red is on her last leg, for real this time.‚Äù¬†

Big Red, my 2010 red Toyota Camry, had long lost its luster‚Äîrims dulled, windows cracked, engine knocking like death was at the door.¬†

‚ÄúBig Red? You're still driving that P.O.S.?‚Äù Mom giggled. She‚Äôd been trying to stop cursing since I was ten. I guessed the word ‚Äúshit"" had finally become too much for her. ‚ÄúYou're old enough to buy a new car.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDo you have new car money?‚Äù I laughed.¬†

I walked over to the dining room table and leaned against it, crossing my arms and mimicking my mom‚Äôs posture.¬†

‚ÄúBut nah...‚Äù I trailed off, ""I think I‚Äôm going to have to buy a new car. Big Red is done with my shit‚Äîoop, I mean, mess.‚Äù I had tripped over my swear words like Mom used to when I was little.¬†

The fried chicken crackled in oil. The back door was propped open, trying to let out the heavy scent. Everything looked the same, but my parents looked... older. Tired.¬†

I heard heavy footsteps and knew my dad was about to make his ‚Äúgrand entrance‚Äù. ‚ÄúOh boy.‚Äù I thought.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHow long are you planning on staying this time?‚Äù My father said, coming into the kitchen from the garage, the laminate floors creaking at each step like they always did.¬† He stunk of grease or oil or whatever goes in or on cars. The room had quickly gone from rose-colored to the cream-and-gray color palette it had always been.¬†

‚ÄúHey, Pops,‚Äù I said through a fake smile. ‚ÄúI was thinking about staying until Sunday. I have work Monday, so‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúA whole five days away from work? You don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll roll over and die, do you?‚Äù My dad had always been childish and annoying. He and I would get into arguments like brother and sister‚Äîhim calling me a dumb bitch more than once.¬†

‚ÄúI hope I don‚Äôt,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúI did a bunch of overtime, and this next check is what‚Äôs going to get me to Costa Rica in a couple of weeks. Have you ever been?‚Äù I had asked, knowing he hadn‚Äôt. Neither he nor my mom had left the swampy heat of the Gulf Coast marshes since their spring break in 1993.¬†

My dad rolled his eyes and reached into the freezer for another beer. My mom, always the tension diffuser, jumped in:¬†

‚ÄúOoh, Costa Rica! Aye Aye!‚Äù she said, mimicking a Spanish accent.¬†

‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù I said, doing a little dance. ‚ÄúFour days of sun and sand, beaches and booze.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got enough money for a trip to Costa Rica but not enough for a new car? Priorities, I guess,‚Äù Dad muttered.¬†

‚ÄúSpeaking of which, I need you to take a look at the car again. It‚Äôs making loud noises.‚Äù¬†

‚Äú‚ÄòHi Dad! How are you, Dad? What‚Äôs been up with you?‚Äô ‚ÄòOh, nothing daughter, just working and living life. Thank you for asking.‚Äô‚Äù My father mimicked the whole conversation like a cartoon.¬†

I wanted so badly to roll my eyes, but I knew better. I pushed myself off the kitchen table I‚Äôd been sitting on and took a labored walk over to my father. He grabbed me up with a slight smile poking through his curly, dirty beard and pulled me into the tightest bear hug I‚Äôd ever had.¬†

Dad had never hugged me before.¬†  
I wished I‚Äôd known that would be the last time he ever did.¬†

I kept things light, cracking jokes and making polite conversations, just pretending it was another visit. But for one reason or another, everything was off. Every. Little. Thing. I wish I'd said something when I noticed first.¬†¬†

It was late afternoon, and Mom had been making dinner‚Äîwhich was odd. A huge dinner at that. She usually was rushing to some sale at some outlet mall, telling us that dinner would be whatever she decided to bring home that night. This sudden ‚ÄúBig Momma‚Äù style dinner seemed... fictional, is the word that comes to mind.¬†¬†

After a while, my parents stopped talking to me or each other altogether, slipping into a kind of routine trance. Dad had grabbed snacks from the kitchen cupboards and a few more beers from the freezer. Mom had still been cooking, nearing the end now, pulling homemade biscuits out of the oven and whipping together some kind of sauce or gravy. She‚Äôd been smiling more than usual. Even though her skin was deep brown, she practically blushed. She had on a worn out, matching yellow gingham short set. I thought she looked gorgeous; her black wig draped neatly over her shoulders.¬†

At a second glance, I noticed her knees‚Äîbruised and nearly raw; healing skin scraped over them. It was... disgusting.¬†¬†

I noticed. I stared. But still, I didn't bother asking.¬†¬†

Dinner was fried chicken, greens, macaroni, biscuits from scratch. A whole spread for a Wednesday. Mama said she just wanted to cook for her baby. But her eyes stayed glassy. And her hands shook when she passed the plate.¬†

Assuming this newfound silence was their new norm, I walked leisurely past my father, who was watching Sanford and Son on the TV, surely half-drunk. I'd gone upstairs to my room, which was now just an indistinct gray guest room. I had been gone six months, and the only trace of me was the family photos still hanging on the walls of the stairway and the small tick marks on the doorway of the guest room where momma used to track how tall I was getting.¬†

I dropped my bag in the entryway of the empty closet. The sunlight streaming in through the window was a brilliant pink and orange‚Äîso bright it nearly blinded me. I closed the blinds, kicked off my shoes, and laid stomach-down on the bed.¬†

My phone had been hot in my pocket. I pulled it out and saw three text messages from Duke, my boyfriend. He wanted to know if the dune buggy I called a car had puttered its way to our destination. Miraculously, it had. I wanted to text him back, but I was suddenly too tired to do anything more than roll onto my side and drift off to sleep.¬†

When I woke up, I was drenched in sweat. The hot, wet heat of the swamp had seeped through the walls. I knew I‚Äôd missed dinner because all the lights in the house had been off, and there was an eerie silence‚Äîsave for the TV playing quietly in my parents‚Äô room.¬†

I opened the door to complete darkness. With each step, I began to miss the nightlights that used to shine bright along the blackened hallway. I was deathly afraid of the dark from the ages of 4 to 10 and would often wet the bed out of fear. Mom was never mad at me. Dad always called me pissy sheets.¬†

I'd gotten up and walked to the bathroom, rubbing makeup into my eyes. The burn was familiar but intense, so I picked up the pace, pushed open the bathroom door, and began washing my face quickly. I reached over to the decorative towel ring on the wall and yanked the towel toward my face. As I rubbed my eyes, I could‚Äôve sworn I saw someone walk past the open door. I hurried and closed it quickly. Suddenly aware that I was in my underwear‚Äîfeeling shy and embarrassed.¬†

I brushed my teeth and opted to shower in the morning. I heard the familiar ping before I saw Duke‚Äôs text message: ‚ÄúHope everything is ok, a good dinner and a weird hug shouldn‚Äôt throw you completely off‚Äù¬†

I wrapped a larger towel around my waist and picked up my phone. I smiled a little, only Duke could make me smile like that. While still looking at my phone, I tossed the dirty face towel into its basket and swung the bathroom door open.¬†

She was just... standing there.¬†

My mother: she was naked, her hands bloodied and held out as if asking for spare change. The blood was pouring from them in a continuous stream. Her eyes were wide open, but blank behind the pupils. Her ass and face were caked in mud. Her feet and calves were nearly black with it‚Äîlike she had been knee-deep in a sinking hole and pulled out just in time. Her skin sagged slightly, and cellulite rippled across her whole body. The small tattoo on her hip that I'd only seen at pool parties or fitting rooms was faded and smeared with mud too.¬†¬†

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù¬†¬†

She didn't answer me.¬†

The sight shocked me into silence, milking a single tear from my unblinking eyes. That had been my mother‚Äîthe only mom I‚Äôd ever known‚Äîbut it wasn't her at all. It was a frightening, emaciating version of her. The Walking Dead version of her.¬†

From the left, my dad swooped in, carrying the thinnest sheet I‚Äôd ever seen. He was panicked and tired. The way he hung his head and how hastily he moved, I knew he had done this before.¬†¬†

‚ÄúOh baby...Tyanna, come on with this shit, man,‚Äù he whispered, the words barely leaving his lips. ‚ÄúCome on, baby.‚Äù He walked up to her like she was a scared animal that might run off and covered her with the sheet.¬†¬†

After our long stare off, a sullen look washed over her, crumpling from a blank disdain to a sort of confusion, maybe fear. My mom turned towards my dad as she began to cry. ‚ÄúI'm here babe. C‚Äômon.‚Äù He said, his voice cracking at the end. She grabbed onto the tissue paper like sheet and folded in on herself with shame.¬†

¬†They turned their backs to me, dad whispering something sweetly into mom's ear. Then,¬† They walked off together, hand in hand, into their bedroom, and shut the door.¬†

I stood there, motionless and crying, for a while. When I realized my towel had fallen from my hips, it snapped back to the land of the living.¬†¬†

By this point I was fully aware that something was wrong. My heart pounded in my ears. I ran into the guest room and crawled under the covers like the child I suddenly felt like again.¬†

I swiped furiously to Duke‚Äôs text thread. Ignoring all the earlier ones, I typed:¬†

Would you mind coming over tmr? 5 days is too long to be here alone.¬†

I waited on pins and needles for his response. Duke was always up at all hours of the night, so I assumed my message would be answered quickly.¬†¬†

I stared at the screen, bouncing my leg tirelessly under the covers. The room was slick with heat, yet my teeth chattered together as I shivered with fear. I'd just started to think he‚Äôd fallen asleep when he texted back:¬†

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Le Havre vs. AS Monaco: A Tale of Two Tides (and Why the Odds Are as Clear as a Sunburn at Noon)**

Let‚Äôs cut to the chase: **AS Monaco** is the statistical favorite to humiliate **Le Havre** in their August 17 Ligue 1 opener, and the numbers don‚Äôt just suggest it‚Äîthey *screamed* it into a megaphone and had the megaphone tweet it.

### Parsing the Odds: Why Monaco‚Äôs Price Tag Feels Like a Clearance Sale

The bookmakers are giving Monaco a **73.5% to 80% implied probability** of victory (depending on the board), with DraftKings and BetRivers pricing them at **1.36 and 1.25**, respectively. For context, that‚Äôs the kind of confidence you‚Äôd have betting your friend‚Äôs car keys that they‚Äôll spill coffee on their laptop again. Le Havre, meanwhile, is a **13.3% to 14.8% shot**, which is about the same chance as correctly guessing your spouse‚Äôs password on the first try. The draw? A paltry **20%**, which is basically the sportsbook‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it.‚Äù

Monaco‚Äôs dominance in the odds isn‚Äôt just about star power (though Kylian Mbapp√©‚Äôs cousin *did* recently master the art of folding laundry). It‚Äôs about **consistency**. Le Havre, on the other hand, has the reliability of a Wi-Fi signal in a submarine. They‚Äôve won just one home game all season and lost six of their last seven matches. Their recent 3-1 win over New England Revolution? A fluke so baffling, it makes you wonder if the Revolution forgot to bring a team.

### Digesting the News: Le Havre‚Äôs ‚ÄúWin‚Äù Was Basically a Garage Sale

Let‚Äôs unpack Le Havre‚Äôs ‚Äúvictory‚Äù against New England. A 3-1 win sounds respectable until you realize it‚Äôs the soccer equivalent of beating a toddler at Mario Kart. They‚Äôve been outscored 14-5 in their last three games and have the defensive coordination of a group of toddlers playing Jenga. Their lone home win this season? Achieved by scoring a single goal while allowing zero‚Ä¶ in a match that

## Key Features Analysis

The best organic green teas stand out due to their sourcing, processing methods, and overall quality. Let's delve into the features that define a superior organic green tea.**Sourcing and Certification:** The origin of the tea leaves directly impacts its quality and flavor profile.

Look for teas sourced from reputable regions known for high-quality tea production, such as Japan (specifically Uji or Shizuoka), China (like Zhejiang province for Longjing), or India (Darjeeling). Organic certification from recognized bodies like USDA Organic or EU Organic guarantees that the tea is grown without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers, ensuring a healthier and more environmentally pleasant product.

**Processing Methods:** The way tea leaves are processed considerably affects their flavor and antioxidant content.

Steaming is a common method in Japan,yielding teas with a fresh,grassy flavor and vibrant green color. Pan-firing is frequently enough used in China, resulting in teas with a roasted or nutty taste. The processing temperature and duration are crucial for preserving the tea's natural compounds and preventing bitterness.

**Leaf Grade and Appearance:** The physical appearance of the tea leaves indicates its quality and the part of the plant used.

Whole leaves or minimally broken leaves generally indicate higher quality compared to tea dust or fannings. Look for leaves that are uniformly green and have a vibrant color, which suggests careful handling and freshness. The presence of buds (young, unopened leaves) often indicates a higher concentration of antioxidants and a more delicate flavor.

**Antioxidant Content:** Green tea is renowned for its high antioxidant levels, particularly catechins like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG).The antioxidant content can vary depending on factors such as the tea variety, growing conditions, and processing techniques. Look for teas that explicitly mention their EGCG content or boast about their antioxidant capacity. Brewing method also significantly affects the amount of antioxidants extracted.**Flavor Profile and Aroma:** The taste and aroma of organic green tea should be pleasant and balanced.

A good organic green tea should exhibit a complex flavor profile, ranging from vegetal and grassy to subtly sweet or nutty.The aroma should be fresh and inviting, without any musty or artificial scents. The absence of bitterness or astringency suggests proper processing and quality.

Key features of the best organic green teas include:

*   USDA or EU Organic certification
*   Sourcing from reputable tea-growing regions
*   Minimal processing techniques to preserve antioxidants
*   Whole or minimally broken leaves
*   Pleasant and balanced flavor and aroma

## Core Benefits

Consuming organic green tea offers several tangible benefits,ranging from improved health to enhanced well-being.

**Boosted Energy Levels:** Organic green tea contains a moderate amount of caffeine, which can provide a gentle and sustained energy boost without the jitters often associated with coffee.This makes it an excellent alternative for those seeking increased alertness and focus throughout the day, especially given its slower release due to the presence of L-theanine.

**Enhanced Cognitive Function:** The combination of caffeine and L-theanine in organic green tea has been shown to improve cognitive function, including attention, memory, and reaction time. L-theanine promotes relaxation without drowsiness, creating a state of calm alertness that enhances mental performance and productivity.

**Improved Heart Health:** Studies suggest that regular consumption of organic green tea may contribute to improved cardiovascular health by lowering blood pressure, reducing cholesterol levels, and improving blood vessel function.The antioxidants in green tea help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation, which are major risk factors for heart disease.

**Weight Management Support:** Organic green tea may aid in weight management by boosting metabolism and promoting fat oxidation. The catechins in green tea, particularly EGCG, have been shown to increase energy expenditure and support the breakdown of fat, making it a helpful addition to a healthy diet and exercise routine.

**Rich in Antioxidants:** Organic green tea is a rich source of antioxidants, which help protect the body against damage from free radicals.These antioxidants can definitely help reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease, and promote overall health and longevity.

## FAQs Section

here are some frequently asked questions regarding organic green tea:

**What is the best time to drink organic green tea?**
The best time to drink organic green tea is typically in the morning or early afternoon. Drinking it later in the day may interfere with sleep due to its caffeine content. It's also advisable to avoid drinking it on an empty stomach, as it can sometimes cause nausea or stomach upset.

**How do I brew organic green tea properly?**
Brewing organic green tea requires attention to temperature and steeping time. Use water that is between 170-185¬∞F (77-85¬∞C) to avoid burning the leaves and causing bitterness. Steep for 2-3 minutes, and avoid over-steeping. Using filtered water can also enhance the flavor.

**Can organic green tea interact with medications?**
Organic green tea can potentially interact with certain medications, such as blood thinners and stimulants. If you are taking any medications, it's best to consult with your healthcare provider before incorporating organic green tea into your daily routine to ensure there are no contraindications.

**What are the potential side effects of drinking too much green tea?**
Drinking excessive amounts of organic green tea can lead to side effects such as insomnia, anxiety, irritability, and stomach upset due to its caffeine content. It can also interfere with iron absorption if consumed with meals. Moderation is key to enjoying the benefits of green tea without experiencing adverse effects.

#### [Brand C] Organic Green Tea Bags
*   **Flavor:** Mild and balanced
*   **Sourcing:** Multiple origins
*   **Processing:** Varies,typically cut tea leaves in bags
*   **Certification:** USDA Organic

### Key Differences Summary

Brand A's Organic Sencha Green Tea stands out with its fresh,grassy flavor and sourcing from the reputable Uji region of Japan. Brand B, while also organic, may have a more astringent and bitter taste due to its pan-firing process. Brand C,available in tea bags,offers a milder and more convenient option but may lack the depth of flavor compared to loose-leaf options.

### Parse the Odds: When Math Meets Mayhem

The bookmakers aren‚Äôt just handing out favorable odds to Inter Milan‚Äîthey‚Äôre practically handing them a gold-plated trophy. At decimal odds of **1.37‚Äì1.43** (implying a **69‚Äì73% chance to win**), Inter is the sportsbook‚Äôs version of a guaranteed Netflix password: reliable, boring, and slightly overpriced. Torino, meanwhile, sits at **7.05‚Äì7.5** (**13‚Äì15% chance**), which is about as likely to win as me mastering TikTok dances. The draw? A modest **4.4‚Äì4.8** (**20‚Äì22%**), because even in football, nothing is ever simple.

The spread doesn‚Äôt make it easier: Inter is favored by **-1.25 goals**, meaning they‚Äôll need to win by two to make their backers feel less silly. For context, that‚Äôs like asking Torino to defend like a sieve and still lose by only one. Good luck with that.

The first flavor I‚Äôm exploring is Strawberry Shortcake, which includes collagen and vitamin C to support skin health, aiming to blend indulgence with wellness.

I‚Äôd love to get feedback from industry professionals on a few points:

* How do you see refrigerated syrups fitting into current market trends and consumer preferences?
* What challenges and opportunities should I anticipate in production and distribution?
* From a formulation standpoint, how important is incorporating real fruit puree versus flavor extracts?
* Are there particular functional ingredients gaining traction that you‚Äôd recommend considering?
* How would you advise approaching positioning to differentiate in a market dominated by sugary, shelf-stable syrups?

Any insights, experiences, or resources you could share would be incredibly valuable as I shape this concept.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Serie A showdown that‚Äôs as lopsided as a pizza slice after a earthquake. On August 23, AC Milan, fresh off a pre-season romp against Liverpool, hosts Cremonese in what promises to be a mismatch so stark, even the players might pause to Google ‚Äúhow to make this game more competitive.‚Äù Let‚Äôs break down the numbers, news, and why Cremonese‚Äôs best bet is to bring a white flag and a sense of humor.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Milan‚Äôs Implied Probability Is Basically a Foregone Conclusion

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind Milan like a toddler with a favorite teddy bear. Decimal odds range from **1.38 to 1.40** for the Rossoneri, translating to an implied probability of **71.4% to 73.5%**. To put that in perspective, Milan is the ‚Äúsun rising in the east‚Äù of football matches‚Äîunlikely to surprise anyone. Cremonese, meanwhile, is priced between **6.25 and 8.0**, implying a **12.5% to 16%** chance to pull off a miracle. For context, that‚Äôs about the same odds as me napping successfully without a coffee in my system.

The draw? A meager **20% to 22.2%** chance (odds of 4.4‚Äì4.8). If this game ended in a stalemate, the universe would probably pause to check its calculations.

### News Digest: Milan‚Äôs Pre-Season Is a Masterclass; Cremonese‚Äôs Prep Is‚Ä¶ Quirky

Milan‚Äôs coach, Massimiliano Allegri, just praised his team‚Äôs ‚Äúpress resistance and hard-working attitude‚Äù after a 4-2 pre-season win over Liverpool. Translation: We looked decent, and the starters didn‚Äôt all die of heatstroke. Their friendlies this summer? A veritable buffet of quality opposition: **Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, Leeds, and Napoli**. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre training for the Serie A version of *The Hunger Games*‚Äîbut with more passes and fewer spears.

Cremonese, mean

There is this guy I know who‚Äôs a party promoter and we‚Äôve talked a little casually about me playing at one of his events. I‚Äôve had a couple of personal events of mine where I play the kind of music that I like and he always makes comments about how the music  would not work for his parties  and would be better enjoyed by the People in the richer neighborhoods of our city which annoys me because he seems to be implying it‚Äôs not authentically African because it‚Äôs Afro house which is an electronic genre. Now I‚Äôve always been a little annoyed because the occasions when I‚Äôm  playing where he says this stuff are usually my personal parties, not his.

So yesterday I wanted to play some music and because he knows people I was like yeah you can come over and invite a few friends. He does and starts making the same type of comments and i reacted negatively. 

The party was really fun and then after most have left, the party promoter starts saying I don‚Äôt listen and that it feels disrespectful to him when I talk about how i think my music is great, and he has experience and I should listen to him blah blah blah, it becomes an argument because i tel him I‚Äôm playing my music at my parties and I‚Äôve not tried to impose my music at his parties, I just take offense at him saying my music is for the snobby people in the rich neighborhoods.

Now there‚Äôs this girl let‚Äôs call A who is friends with him and is also there when this argument is happening. I don‚Äôt know her well but my impression is she‚Äôs kind of like very flaky all over the place kind of person. The whole night, her behavior has been interesting but i was having fun so i didn‚Äôt care that much. she starts taking apart my entire kitchen to find utensils and pots that she can play with on top of the music.  it‚Äôs a little intrusive obviously but I‚Äôm not too annoyed at this point you know because I‚Äôm like whatever she‚Äôs a little weird but kind of fun and she likes to dance. then She starts moving things around, she rolls the carpet up anyway  and moves my coffee table. She puts cloth on the on the lightbulbs to dim them you know and at this point, I‚Äôm still like whatever they make the party more fun.

And then when me and the promoter are having the argument,she begins to dress me down for being defensive and then I need to learn how to ‚Äú take things with love‚Äù and then this is the kicker. we‚Äôve been drinking all night she brought like a beer and pretty much all the alcohol I had she‚Äôs been drinking which I didn‚Äôt care about but then at this point it‚Äôs the end of the night and there‚Äôs not Much alcohol left but I have two bottles of wine one that I bought and a nicer one that was a gift. she asks me for a drink. I say she can open the one that I bought which is not the gift. She then says no, proceeds to take the other bottle that I did not offer her,opens that literally takes two solo cups, pours about 2 glasses worth of wine into each cup,  keeps pouring  and looking at me and at the bottle she says ummmm you still have half, then she pours some more! She then takes her coat, says goodnight and they leave with the solo cups each 3 quarters of the way full of wine. Meanwhile she‚Äôs like literally lecturing me about how I‚Äôm so defensive and she hopes i learn to take things with love. And I‚Äôm just standing there rather angry and i go to bed like that. This morning i felt like i had to say something so i sent her a text and described exactly what she did with the wine and told her that it is the behavior of an AH.  so yeah what do you think? Let me know if im being the jerk.",1,1753648438.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I (36F) had my bisalp done on 7/18 and am officially sterilized! I credit this sub for helping me understand, prepare, and breathe. Because reading people's full experiences was one of my favorite things to do in preparation for each step of the way, I am going to make a (long) post to detail each step of my experience, including links to my favorite recovery items.

**Consultation**

I found two doctors on the reddit childfree doctor's list and scheduled a consult with each. I had them both the same day so my husband and I could take off work and go to both appointments together. The first was with a surgeon near me (the hospital is about 10 minutes from home). The doctor answered all of my questions, but I just didn't get the vibe I was looking for. I have a lot of medical anxiety and actually had extreme high blood pressure at that appointment because of it. Instead of calming me down, her response to my high blood pressure only made me more worried. 

My next consult was that afternoon and was with a doctor/hospital about 35 minutes from home in a different county. I absolutely loved this doctor! She was also worried about the high blood pressure, but gave me steps to take with my primary care doctor so that my anxiety wouldn't spike my blood pressure on surgery day. She also just had such a good bedside manner! She started the appointment by showing me a whiteboard with the female anatomy and walking me through with a marker exactly what would happen in the surgery. She also offered up how often she does this surgery, how many complications she's seen, and answered some frequently asked questions before getting to my own questions. When I told her that I've been thinking about this for years but that the current administration is the reason I am pursuing it at this moment, she said, ""don't let that asshole dictate anything about your life"" and that was the icing on the cake that she was the right surgeon for me.

**Pre-Op Appointment**

One week before my surgery was the pre-op appointment at the hospital. The nurse took my vitals and then asked about a zillion questions about me. She then asked if I had any questions as she started to prepare to examine me, and when I pulled out my list she stopped what she was doing, sat down, and said ""let's take our time and go through your list."" I really appreciated that she gave me and my questions her full attention like that, and she did a great job answering everything for me. She then did a routine physical exam.

The only tough part of my pre-op was the bloodwork. Unfortunately I did not think to do extra hydration ahead of time, which with my veins is always necessary, so it was a challenge for her to take my blood. She had a second nurse come in to help, and they eventually got it, but with my usual medical anxiety of course them struggling was tough for me. It was also more painful than usual, and I later realized it's because they hit a nerve. I am still having some nerve pain from that day, and my best advice is for everyone to drink a lot of water before getting blood drawn!

**Surgery Day**

My surgery was scheduled for a Friday at 7:30am, so I was told to arrive at 5:45. I got there right on time and there were about 5 other people at the hospital waiting to get checked in. Luckily once I was called it was quick, as I had just been there for the pre-op appointment. Other people's check ins took much longer, and I was very thankful I had done the pre-op at the hospital the week before because it made that morning much less stressful. Once I was checked in I was sent to the surgery waiting room, and was there for about 5 minutes before being called back.

I was the first patient of the day called into the pre-op area which was honestly very nice. It was quiet and I could see the hospital staff arriving with their coffees, and for some reason I found this very calming. The nurse who did my pre-op was great, and even though I was very nervous, she was gentle and patient. She had me change into a gown and grippy socks, took my vitals, and did a final vial of bloodwork plus my IV. I told her about my bad experience the week before so she was gentle and careful to ensure everything was smooth this time. She also had me read and sign another consent form and walked me through what to expect that day. It was like an out-of-body experience for me laying in a hospital bed being prepared for surgery, but honestly between the nurse and the calm vibes of the early morning, I was not stressed. 

Once I was fully prepped, it was then a revolving door of meeting people. The assistant anesthesiologist came in and I asked some questions, then I met my surgery nurse, then the anesthesiologist herself came by. Lastly my surgeon came, and when she saw my paper with a list of questions she jokingly said to hand it over, and she read each question and answered them all. It boiled down to her being like, listen- you are young and healthy and my guess is by the end of the weekend you will feel totally fine. I didn't quite believe that, but she just had such good energy that it made me feel confident going in.

Finally it was time, and the surgery nurse wheeled me to the OR. One of my questions for the anesthesiologist had been about anti-anxiety meds, and they said he could give them as soon as I was in the OR. Well I guess they did because while I *vaguely* remember moving from the pre-op bed to the OR table, I have zero memory of the mask over my face to put me under. My memory goes from scooting onto the table to waking up!

Waking up was an odd experience. I couldn't open my eyes for a while, so I just listened to the sounds of everything around me. Eventually I opened my eyes and the post-op nurse came by and offered me something to drink. I drank apple juice and just laid there for what felt like forever as I continued waking up. Eventually I asked for ginger ale, and then for graham crackers, so I leisurely ate and drank. The surgeon came to see me, told me everything went well, and showed me pictures, but I was still pretty out of it so I don't remember much. I honestly have no clue how much time passed, but at some point I asked for my husband and she said I seemed awake enough to be moved, so within about 10 minutes they moved me to another space and had me go from the bed to a recliner, and then my husband came in.

From there, they helped me get dressed, use the bathroom, and then went over recovery instructions. The surgeon had already met with my husband and gone through everything, but I did have some questions that they answered. Once that was done a nurse wheeled me from recovery right to the front door of my car! By this point it was around 11:30am or so, and I was home by around noon.

**Recovery- First 24 Hours**

I purchased a few recovery items thanks to recommendations in this sub, and they really helped! First was this [post surgery pillow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL3MS6K3?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1). It has a place for the seatbelt to go through, so I brought it for the car ride home and it was amazing! Once I got home I brought the pillow to bed where I had t[his wedge](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D571F3BK?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) all set up and waiting so I could easily and comfortably sit up in bed. I leaned against the wedge and held the pillow over my belly, and not five minutes after I got settled the doorbell rang, and it was lunch sent by my mother-in-law. I was able to eat as normal, and I drank ginger ale mixed with [these Miralax packs](https://www.miralax.com/products/miralax-mix-in-pax). I typically hate anything that isn't a pill, but this had almost no flavor so it was fine.

After lunch, my husband plugged in my [new heating pad](https://www.costco.com/purerelief-pro-far-infrared-xl-heating-pad.product.4000204952.html) which felt amazing! The rest of the day we just hung out in bed watching tv. I had the heating pad on my abdomen the whole time with the post surgery pillow over it. I took my prescribed pills (switching off Tylenol and Ibuprofen every three hours) and honestly just relaxed. I wasn't able to do much of anything, but when laying there I was only in minor pain.

The most pain I felt was when peeing, and this lasted only about 48 hours and got better over time. I also did have some spotting, but that stopped within about 48 hours as well. Had the burning when peeing lasted longer, my husband was going to pick up some Azo, but it went away quickly enough.

Within the first 24 hours, I also removed the bandages over the steri strips. My surgeon is ADORABLE and cut the bandages into hearts, so I was honestly sad to remove them because seeing the three hearts on my abdomen truly made my smile. But removing them was easy and painless, and the steri strips looked fine underneath.

**Recovery- First Week**

My recovery week honestly felt like a nice staycation! I was amazed and relieved to be in only minor pain, and the pain medication plus the heating pad made me very comfortable. My husband was with me all weekend and also took off work Monday, so we spent those days lazing around in bed or on the couch. I needed help getting in/out of the shower, turning on the water, etc for the first two days, and then I was able to do it on my own (bending at the knees to reach the shower knobs was not hard). I also needed help with reaching certain items, and of course did not attempt to do laundry or anything that required much physical effort.

On the days my husband was gone, I used a[ grabber ](https://www.amazon.com/Reacher-Grabber-Foldable-Reaching-Extension/dp/B0CYLP2G6X/ref=sr_1_4_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.w-Pto17iYMoMdLfMmPAwXpAMDcxhmjZgL_Vis5r8iQPIZIBwccBUoUSVWXQ_RLnwNH7d86Z0tt22DwJCat15wrGIlOCI8cADnZ_0DOxSXirZch8i5qgyI7BbrQJ7358qkyuYAchkuKrNaO9EGl12WpIicCE1WpD5l27xuniRyY4cJvpLBFl53sK0tkl10ODsGEyN-DV9hBI8rQAXL8-RxL79kvfRnNySA6Hq5Oc7fOdiaJks8JPzQfmYv5pn0TI1I0qa3JbulAKjPIZN1d5RZBbF__OJUYVrwl2naJDhLkU.uIFcWtEARleFS3WDxYWf5LpZNT3awDA_XfCcuG9-LUM&dib_tag=se&keywords=grabber&qid=1753646374&sr=8-4-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1)for things I couldn't reach, but honestly it ended up being more for picking up things that I dropped (who knew I dropped so much stuff?!). I stopped taking the pain medication regularly by Monday, and only took it once on Tuesday and not at all on Wednesday. I was still taking it verrrry easy and enjoying the heating pad, but the meds were no longer necessary. I was also using the post surgery pillow religiously, as not only was it comfy, but it also protected my abdomen from my cats who would prefer to lay on me at all times. That pillow was truly been the best purchase!

I started back to work on Thursday remote, and it was mentally exhausting but otherwise mostly fine. I did have more pain by the end of the day just from sitting up all day and using muscles I hadn't used for a week, so I took an Ibuprofin with dinner, and on Friday it was about the same, but overall it wasn't hard getting back to work on the computer.

By this point (9 days post-op) I've started getting back to normal some. I've gone out to eat, gone to the movies, and am planning to go back into the office on Tuesday. While I am still being very good about not lifting heavy items or bending down, I otherwise feel mostly like myself! The only other big thing at this point is hoping the steri strips fall off in the next day or two, and if they don't my doctor said I could remove them. Seeing the incisions will be the final mystery of this whole process! I am still protecting my abdomen from my cats with the pillow and am also still using it when I am a passenger in the car, but other than that things are much closer to normal than I would have expected one weekend after surgery.

‚∏ª

I came to this small town to start over‚Äînew school, new life, and hopefully a better future than where I came from. I keep to myself. Baggy sweaters, messy buns, and shifts at the diner are my routine. No one here would guess the truth about me.

Because at night, three towns over in Rentwood, I‚Äôm someone else entirely.

At a club called Fantasies, I let my long, curly brown hair fall loose, and I wear heels that make my bubble butt pop perfectly. My waist is small, my breasts sit high and perky like gumdrops, and I know how to make people stare.

That‚Äôs where I saw him.

Tall. Tan. At least 6‚Äô3‚Äù, with muscles stretching tight against his shirt like he could split it open any second. His hair was pushed back in that sexy surfer-boy way, and his blue eyes looked like they could cut right through me. He smelled like cognac and vanilla‚Äîrich, warm, expensive‚Äîand when he finally spoke, his deep voice slid down my spine like silk.

He didn‚Äôt look like the type to even breathe in a place like Fantasies. Too sharp, too polished, too‚Ä¶ everything. But he sat down, paid for a private dance, and for those few minutes, I felt his stare on every inch of me.

I thought he‚Äôd leave it at that.

I was wrong.

I started seeing him everywhere. At the coffee shop. Outside my apartment. Parked across the street when I walked to class. He wasn‚Äôt even trying to hide it.

And here‚Äôs the worst part‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt hate it.

The attention made my skin prickle in a way I couldn‚Äôt explain. One night, I decided to push it. I stepped out of the shower, knowing he was parked outside. My towel slipped, and I slowly rubbed lotion into my skin, letting my hair fall over my shoulder. I turned just enough so he could see the curve of my ass in the glow of my lamp.

When I finally looked out the window, our eyes locked.

Minutes later, my door burst open.

He didn‚Äôt ask permission. He pushed me against the wall, his scent‚Äîcognac and vanilla‚Äîwrapping around me as his breath hit my neck. His voice was low, almost growling, when he said:

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever show anyone else what‚Äôs mine.‚Äù

And here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ I should‚Äôve been terrified. But all I could think was how good it felt to be wanted like that.

1mawcxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mawcxl/does_goldtone_charcoal_water_filter_for_cuisinart/,Does GoldTone Charcoal Water Filter for Cuisinart Coffee Makers Improve Taste? Review,"Testing the **GoldTone TEK-cwf-12-gt Charcoal Water Filters** has been a game-changer in maintaining high-quality coffee at home. As a self-proclaimed coffee aficionado, ensuring water used in my coffee maker is pristine has always been a priority. These filters are specifically designed for Cuisinart coffee machines and come in a 12-pack, providing substantial value for regular users like me. The promise of superior filtration using activated coconut carbon intrigued me, and I couldn‚Äôt wait to put them to the test.

**Practical Design and Fit**  
The first thing I noticed about these filters was their compact, basket-style shape, making them compatible with a wide range of Cuisinart coffee makers. Installing them was effortless, and they fit snugly into the allocated slot in my machine without any adjustments‚Äîno fumbling or trimming required. Each filter is lightweight, and the quality of the material felt premium, a significant advantage compared to generic alternatives I‚Äôve tried in the past.

[Curious about GoldTone TEK-cwf-12-gt? Check pricing on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b01iru2y9e/)

**Performance that Packs a Punch**  
After a couple of brews using these GoldTone filters, the difference was evident. It effectively removed chlorine, calcium, and other impurities, allowing the rich flavor of my coffee beans to shine through. I even tested it with tap water to push its limits, and the results were impressive. The unpleasant aftertaste and water odors were eliminated entirely. The coffee tasted smoother and fresher, which made me believe the filters truly deliver on their promises.

**Highlights**  
- Compatible with all Cuisinart coffee makers, ensuring wide usability.  
- Activated coconut carbon delivers superior filtration.  
- Noticeable improvement in coffee taste by removing impurities like chlorine and calcium.  

**Some Limitations**  
Despite my satisfaction, there were a few quirks.  
- The one-month lifespan, while reasonable, necessitates regular replacements, which could require careful tracking.  
- Packaging didn't include instructions, which might inconvenience first-time users.  
- For non-Cuisinart machine users, compatibility might be restricted.  

**Material Quality and Lifespan**  
The activated carbon used in these filters strikes a perfect balance between efficiency and eco-consciousness. Each filter is recommended for a one-month usage period, which matches the industry standard. This 12-pack serves as a one-year supply, reducing the hassle of frequent reordering. However, I found myself wishing for an intuitive indicator signaling when a replacement is needed, as it's easy to lose track over time.

**User Benefits**  
These filters are an economical solution for anyone invested in enhancing their coffee experience, particularly those owning Cuisinart coffee makers. The cost per unit feels justified, considering the filters achieve noticeable improvements in flavor clarity. Buying a year‚Äôs supply also avoids the frustration of running out abruptly‚Äîa small hack for my always-busy mornings.

**Potential Competitors**  
Comparing the GoldTone charcoal filters to brands like Keurig and generic supermarket offerings revealed stark differences. Keurig also offers high-quality filters, but they come at a higher cost without a discernible performance boost. On the cheaper end of the spectrum, the generic ones often feel flimsy and fail to fit as seamlessly. In contrast, GoldTone balances affordability and quality, making it a worthwhile investment for everyday coffee drinkers.

**Value Proposition**  
Spending less while achieving more is where these filters excel. They present a strong **value for money**, especially for frequent coffee consumers who demand flavor consistency. While some brands charge a premium without noticeable advantages, GoldTone strikes a practical balance that feels like a worthy return on your investment.

We've got Brits, a whole bunch of Norwegians for some reason, Bossy Germans, South Americans, Canadians, a solo American, Danes, a Brazilian Cat Girl, a mysterious Dutch guy, a Jaffa Cake, and a posh lady that doesn't actually play ARMA but sometimes just randomly appears in Discord and criticises us. We have two Welsh guys but one got lost on a mountain.

We are a friendly small group of around 25 people. \*\*We play different games in the Discord. Regular DCS ops on Saturdays. DayZ, War Thunder, War Game, WARNO, Ready or Not, Nuclear Option, Deep Rock Galactic.

We like other random stuff too like Minecraft, Baldurs gate, Satisfactory, Signalis, PUBG, CK3, Valheim the list goes on :D
