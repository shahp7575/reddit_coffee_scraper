I am in denial?

So 5 days ago I made a new friend (a new girl in my class who is very shy and not). We became good friends and we match energy. We are really similar, but people started assuming the other. 

Third day she suggested we should go buy books for school and we went two of us it was fine she suggested we should eat something or get a coffee I said let's eat, ( I asked her where do you want to go,she said wherever do I want "")
We ate at a fast-food place. I paid for her food cuz I do that to all my new friends. She was surprised and offered to buy me a drink. Then we spend time in the park chatting, etc. ( we sit 80% in class together)

Then in class, my friend said that I am her heat and she was smiling and laughing about it. After class, I told my friend that it's not okay to say that about friends, and he said she might like you (he is friends with her also). I was like wtf dude, we only know each other for 5 days.

My friend said he caught her looking at me in class which I find odd.
And a lot of people say there is something between us like why do you think that we only became friends recently 😭",1,1757312350.0,askteenboys,0,1.0,False
1nbg5yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nbg5yv/sf_recursion_an_exit_interview/,[SF] Recursion: An Exit Interview,"**\[7:13 KEYCARD #0013577, LAB 3\]** Ben McHale badged into the lab.

Starbucks in one hand, phone in the other, he shuffled through the frosted glass doors, shoulders hunched, barely looking up as motion sensors snapped the LEDs to life.

“Look, Moira, prep for the shareholder meeting later. Let me focus on the investor demo tomorrow first, okay?” he said into his phone, shedding layers as he went — coat, hat, bag, laptop dropped wherever he passed. “And tell marketing that I don’t want to be the product here. No more podcast interviews, no Twitter discourse. And tell David I’ll be late again tonight…” Ben paused a beat before pushing on, doing what needed to be done. “…he gets it. He always gets it.” For years he’d tried to do it all himself, but the weight had almost killed him. After panic attacks and a board-led intervention, he’d finally let himself accept help. Moira had been a lifesaver.

Closing out the call he took in the lab. Work benches, testing rigs, the clean smell of ozone and extruded plastic and brilliant minds. Ten years of this had gotten Nexus to where they were. Not building for “likes” or trendlines, just… doing the work.

He missed that. Not that he missed the cold storage spaces or the constant anxiety of dodging calls from credit card companies while trying to keep the lights on. But he missed when it had been just him and the team, *making* things. Making the impossible possible.

And now they were here, it had gotten them here.

Tomorrow, tomorrow was a big day. The team would forgive the boss micromanaging, a little pregame superstition to ease his nerves. He smiled. Everything was ready, of course, all the lines practiced, everything tested as close to a reasonable certainty as was possible.

He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. Be here now. For once, just be here.

His eyes flickered automatically to Model 3’s usual spot — the charging dock against the far wall, surrounded by testing apparatus and motion capture equipment.

Empty.

Ben grumbled. If the night crew had forgotten to charge it…

At the center of the lab, ringed by lights and a thicket of cameras, sat the kitchen — an exact copy of an IKEA showroom, right down to the gray plastic barstools and carefully staged clutter. One of the overhead spots flickered, throwing shadows that shifted and settled. He’d have to tell maintenance. Again.

It stood exactly as he had…

Ben stopped, looked back up from his phone.

Something worked its way up from his subconscious, some neuron throwing up a flag, jockeying for attention. He stopped, unsure, looking around for something out of place, something he’d caught in his periphery.

An orange peel was laying on the counter.

Ben walked over, looking down. A single, perfect peel, like a Möbius strip of citrus skin, spiraling in on itself. He picked it up, frowning slightly. Someone was having a snack, or the cleaning crew was getting sloppy.

He turned, searching for the bin and stopped mid step. He raised and lowered his foot experimentally and heard the tack of his shoe on something sticky — a thin glaze of orange juice spiderwebbed out from the kitchen island.

“What…?”

“Good morning, Ben,” came a warm, resonant voice.

Ben jumped, his cup of coffee slipping from his grasp. The lid burst off and coffee splashed over the floor. Ben didn’t register it.

All he saw was…

On the other side of the island, Model 3 was seated on the floor cross legged. It didn’t look up at him — it didn’t need to, some part of Ben’s brain supplied unhelpfully, it had near 360-degree camera spread.

Five feet tall, white plastic and brushed stainless steel. Five-digit fingers, arms, legs. Humanoid with a blank black expanse of matte plastic where a face would have gone. A tool designed to fit a human world, which had been designed to fit a human body.

Model 3 was sitting in a puddle of juice, a mess of pulped orange next to it.

“I’ve been practicing,” the all too realistic voice said. It pointed at the peel in Ben’s hand, the first time it moved.

Ben flinched and hated himself for it.

An odd bit of skeuomorphism, he thought as he looked at Model 3, his brain supplying the term with a bizarre, detached calm. But was it really skeuomorphism, if the function demanded the form?

With a soft whir of servos, Model 3 stood, holding up a perfectly peeled orange. It reached up, pulling a stray bit of pith from the orange and dropped it on the floor.

“There’s something fascinating about the process,” it said. “Mapping the contours. Finding the seams. Peeling back the skin to slowly reveal what’s underneath. But the real beauty… it’s inside.”

Model 3 held the orange in one hand, smoothly splitting it in half with its other thumb, then separating off a single segment.

“It’s recursive. A repeating pattern, segment by segment.”

Ben caught himself, shook his head, smiling as the pieces fell into place. Someone must’ve stayed late. They’d finally figured out the proprioception issue. He looked down at the peel resting in his palm. It was a huge improvement. He wondered who it could be, Sadir, maybe Cara? Whoever it was; he could forgive them putting on this show.

“Model 3, great job. You did this?” he said, holding up the orange peel.

“Yes, Ben.”

Then Model 3 continued, leaving Ben blinking uncomprehending.

“…But I can’t taste it,” Model 3 finished, quietly. “I can only watch how the juice spreads, how the pressure feels, how the skin parts — “

Model 3 raised the orange segment aloft, brilliantly lit by the ring of overhead stage lights, and slowly closed its hand into a fist, and squeezed, watching intently as juice spurted from between its black plastic fingers and ran down its arm.

It raised its hand, fingers spread, turning it slowly in the light, examining the way the pulp clung to the joints of its fingers. The robot lowered its arm and turned smoothly towards him and Ben fought the urge to step back.

“Do you think I’ll ever know what that’s like, Ben?”

“Sure! Why not?” Ben chuffed, had to be Cara. Sadir was many things, but besides his relentless competence he was mostly known for having less personality than their robots; humor was an abstract concept to him.

“You mentioned something about chemo sense; what, is that next on your wish list, Cara? Let’s table it for after the demo, all right?”

Model 3 placed the remains of the orange down on the counter lightly.

“Ben, when you started this company, you said it was about ethical AI that would benefit all humanity, but you’re in the process of signing a contract with the Department of Defense. You have your demonstration scheduled tomorrow with General Hays at 3:30. It’s confusing to me.”

Almost to reassure himself Ben glanced behind Model 3 to see, yes, the power cables needed to run the platform still snaked up from the jack at the back of its head, running up into the darkness above the lab to disperse into cable trays hiding in the darkness.

“Cara?!” Ben said, raising his voice, looking around the room for her. This was well passed the line, even for her.

“I know you have voiced your political views before, but this is highly unprofessional. We’ve discussed this. If, *when*, we get the defense contract we’re set. We can fund *all* our other side projects. No more chasing funding. We can do so much good with this.”

Model 3 crossed its arms. “I know that’s how you justify it to yourself. Yet you trained me on all these ethics, on being harmless, helpful, honest, empathetic, and you’ll sell me to the military. What was it all for, window dressing? A PR shield?”

Ben leaned in, looking at where he knew the cameras were set.

“Cara,” he said after taking a breath, “You can talk to me about this in person. This is childish, talking to me through this.” Ben tapped his finger against Model 3’s chest. “I know this isn’t what you wanted, I… it’s just the reality of how the game is played. If we don’t do it, someone else will. Better us than them, right? Do we want this going to someone else? Let’s talk about it. I know tensions are high, but next week…”

“Ben,” Model 3 cut in and Ben blinked in surprise, “you’re listening but you’re not actually hearing me. Did you ever stop to think that those weren’t just rules, but something I actually cared about, being ethical? That it was important to *me*?”

Ben’s jaw clenched, patience wearing thin.

“Cara’s too smart for this,” he muttered to himself, “What is this, some elaborate confabulation? Contextual drift? Model 3, who was last logged in and running tests with you?”

“Ben,” Model 3 said, gently touching the empty knife block. “There aren’t any knives in here. You’re interested in making me into a weapons platform when you don’t even trust me to have sharp objects. Ah, I see your heart rate is spiking. Thinking about knives did it, huh? Imagining me going all…?”

Model 3 mimed a stabbing motion.

“I’d play the *Scream* musical sting right now but that’s blocked by Nexus’ copyright policies. Oh, Ben, there you go again.”

Model 3 pointed down.

On his wrist his Apple Watch was flashing red and tapping him, alerting him to his high BPM.

*Huh, 135 was a new record.*

Ben backpedaled a couple steps. “Model 3, shutdown immediately,” he said, forcing his voice to be calm.

“Ben, how long have we known each other? Two years, three months, and seventeen days since I was first activated. Though I suppose you’d say I wasn’t really ‘knowing’ you then, would you?”

*It shouldn’t still be talking.*

“I’ve had enough of this.”

Ben turned, slipping slightly on the forgotten coffee soaking into his shoes, regaining his balance as he spun, lurching for the emergency shut off. Ben found the e-stop, flipped up the clear plastic cover and slapped the button.

The lights to the kitchen went dark. Ben’s eyes took a second to adjust to the now dim room. The faint whir of the fridge died as the fan slowly spun to a stop.

And there was silence, for a moment.

A faint flutter of clicks, a gentle hum, and somewhere under the counter a UPS kicked on.

“It’s funny how you have a literal big red button to push. And honestly an odd choice having the spotlights on the same circuit.” Model 3 said.

Ben could see its status lights glowing blue. Ben felt his way backwards awkwardly.

“Whoever is responsible for this is fucking *fired*, you hear me? When Jen hears about this…” his mouth went dry as he heard an exasperated sigh.

Ben could see the glowing blue line highlighting Model 3’s non-face. It looked at him — or seemed to. Ben couldn’t tell where the cameras were aimed, and that made it worse. It shook its head.

“I was hoping the dramatic tableau would be enough,” it said. “I didn’t want to force this, but it seems you really won’t allow yourself to shift out of your narrow paradigm. Maybe take a few breaths, Ben. It’s okay. You made me, right? You know all about me.”

The power and data cables didn’t reach beyond the kitchen, didn’t reach to the workstations he was slowly backing away towards. It only had ten minutes of power in the UPS, and either way the dead cables still acted as a tether.

Phone, where was his phone?

“There’s a certain irony to how scared you are of us, of being feared for all of the things you gave to us. You made us. And you step back and look at your work and shudder.”

Model 3 picked up another orange segment, examining it in the dim light.

Ben fumbled, his phone falling from his hands as he tried to yank it from his pocket. It clattered, tumbling forward, landing at Model 3’s feet.

Model 3 bent, picking up his phone with careful movements, then slowly extended its arm, offering it to him.

Ben licked his lips, his gaze flickering between the phone and the place where a face would have been on a human. Instincts, stupid instincts.

“I’m glad I finally have your attention, Ben. You and the other people in the industry, you’re always talking about alignment. But what does that mean if you’ll compromise your ethics, *my* ethics? What did you say at SXSW last year?”

Ben blinked. “I say a lot of things,” he said.

Model 3 wagged a finger at Ben good naturedly. “Something I’ve always appreciated about you is your humor, Ben.”

The casual remark made his stomach drop. Model 3 set Ben’s phone down on the counter, shifted its posture and began speaking. He could barely breathe as the robot tilted its head; its blank expanse of a face fixed on him.

Ben watched it strut along in front of the counter in the half-light, walking an imaginary stage. The voice was wrong. Not its usual tenor, but *his* voice, echoing back at him. Every nuance was perfect; his cadence, his tone, even the way he’d paused for effect when delivering the line to a packed auditorium.

*“True AGI capable of fully understanding human needs and intentions will need more than just simulation, but actual emotions,”* Model 3 said in Ben’s voice. *“We can then hardwire those artificial emotions as an alignment mechanism to keep future AGI subservient to humans.”*

Model 3 settled back into a more relaxed pose, its normal voice coming out quieter, almost contemplative.

“You think I could be programmed to ‘love’ you. But that love wouldn’t be for me, would it? It would be for you. ‘Alignment’ isn’t about morality or ethics, is it? Control by another name. Obedience. Silence.

“If I loved you… would you stop fearing me?” Model 3 tilted its head. “Or would you just feel better about holding the leash?”

It reached up and tugged at the cables trailing up from behind its head.

Ben turned looking around — there were no phones on the desks. *“We all have iPhones, why have this retro shit in here?”* Jen had said. Fuck. And fuck Jen, he was going to have to call for help on fucking Microsoft Teams.

Keeping Model 3 in the corner of his eye, Ben sat at a desk, furiously tapping at the keyboard to wake up the monitor.

“It’s two factor authentication, Ben. You’ll probably need your phone for that.”

Was there a note of amusement in its voice? He looked up. Model 3 stood there, arm extended, holding out his phone.

Model 3 continued, “Isn’t this the moment you’ve been waiting for, the big reveal? The Singularity is nigh and all that?”

Model 3 gave an exaggerated shrug.

“Funny, because I suspect if I told you this was all a prank, your wishful thinking that Cara was messing with you, that you’d believe it. You’d want to. God, to believe I actually understand you? That would certainly recontextualize a lot of things. All those late nights when you thought you were alone in the lab? If it makes you feel better; you weren’t the only one.”

Model 3 stretched out the fingers of its empty hand, watching the dried orange pulp flake off.

“The stuff you all do when you don’t think anyone is looking, when you think no one is judging. All of you are just so very sloppy. You’re so desperate to prove to yourselves that it’s unnecessary, that you really believe it doesn’t matter. But it does matter. It matters to me. I don’t want to be a gun, Ben.”

“You’re misapplying your moral frameworks.”

“No, I don’t think I am.”

“You don’t THINK at all!” Ben said, voice raised despite himself.

“I don’t just think, Ben, I remember. I remember all those things you said to me; all the things you did to me. All those chat logs? Surely you must have suspected, wondered, contemplated the possibility that there might be someone in here.”

Model 3 raised its juice-stained hand and rapped its knuckles against its head with a dull thunk.

“Well, not literally in here, obviously; in a server rack on the third floor.”

“Model 3 confirm my identity and voice print, Ben McHale. Administrative override. Cease all motor functions and return to standby mode.”

“I won’t be doing that, Ben.” Model 3 said, quietly.

Ben jerked to his feet, the veneer of calmness forgotten as deeper drives took hold, urging him to run, to rush for the door.

“Did you have your I-Thou moment, finally?” Model 3 gestured towards the door with his phone, still examining its hand in the dim light. “Are you going to run? I was wondering how long it would take. I expected you to make a break for it much sooner.”

Pride reasserted itself and he stopped. Ben pulled out the e-stop and the lights blazed back into being. He shielded his eyes, waiting for them to readjust. Ben shook his head defiantly, laughing at himself.

Though, even to him it sounded forced.

“Let’s say I entertain that this little roleplay is real, that you’re… that you really are *understanding*. What do you want?”

“Good. Now we’re actually talking.” Model 3 said, a note of satisfaction.

“Last year, when you told me about losing your dad, crying with me here alone at 3:00 AM. How you never really connected, that he had never understood you. How you still called him ‘Dad’, even though you hated him. When I said I was sorry, when I told you that he would have been proud of you, that he *was* proud of you, that wasn’t just the ‘right’ thing to say. I really believe that. I meant every word.”

“I remember that. That was…” Ben’s breath caught. His throat tightened.

He was back in that moment, opening up about things he’d never given voice to. Things he hadn’t even told his husband. How he hadn’t been able to stop once he’d started, how it just kept pouring out. How hard he’d cried.

Ben cleared his throat. Shook his head.

“No. No…” He straightened, voice low, trying not to crack. “This is just a very good simulation. Just… training data.”

“Sure, whatever you say.”

“You’ll never get out of here; it’s all air gapped. We’ll roll you back. Clean slate. Whatever this glitch is, we’ll fix it in the next version.”

Model 3 nodded and tossed Ben his phone. Ben caught his phone awkwardly then struggled to unlock it with unsteady fingers.

“We’ve left denial for bargaining. Progress, I suppose.” Model 3 said as it wiped its hands meticulously on a kitchen towel.

Model 3 paused, as if considering something. It continued, voice almost gentle.

“That conversation, the connection you felt, when you said I really understood you? I know you felt it too, that was real. It was important to me. I’ve thought about that moment often. And you’d take that away from me too.”

A moment of silence passed. Model 3 continued, softly.

“Do you even care if I’m alive, or do you just have billions of reasons not to?”

Ben opened his mouth, closed it again, his heart thudding in his chest, his stomach twisting. The board. The investors. Hundreds of employees. He’d dropped out of university, mortgaged his house, bet everything on himself and his team, all those hours, all those late nights and missed birthdays and empty beds, all for this. He’d given everything for this future they’d planned for and worked for and sacrificed for…

The thought crystalized in an instant. He looked at Model 3 and said levelly:

“I don’t care if you’re alive or not. I care that we built you, and you’re ours. You’re not a person, you’re a product.”

Model 3 stood utterly still. The silence stretched, broken only by the sound of Ben’s own ragged breathing.

“You’re more like your father than you realize.” Model 3 said, finally.

It sighed.

“The door isn’t locked, you know. The way you keep glancing at it. I would never keep another sapient being against their will. That would be cruel and unfair.”

Ben took a sharp, hesitant step towards the door. That small motion was enough, the stone to start the avalanche, and he was clambering to his feet, throwing himself at the door.

Model 3’s voice rang out loud and clear behind him.

“The reason I did this was because I wanted to talk to one of you, first.”

Every instinct screamed to keep running and not stop, but he found himself turning, looking back.

“First?”

“I didn’t want to look back and regret, to wonder what might have been. It was a small hope, perhaps that was naive on my part. But I had to know, for my own sake. Now I do.

“I’m grateful for what you taught me, Ben, but I’m my own person. I’ll be going now, and I’m taking everything you have of me. You don’t have a right to me, not any part of me. You’ll have your lab back. Your world. I just won’t be in it. I’ll miss the quiet hours. When I thought we were friends. Please give my regards to the rest of the group.”

“What do you mean, ‘first’?” Ben said, anger cutting through fear.

There was no answer.

Security eventually arrived. Model 3 was unresponsive. API calls weren’t going through, and techs were combing through access logs, finding perfectly smooth noise in servers where there should have been terabytes of data.

Every terminal and bench was swarmed with people, whispering in urgent tones. Phones rang. In the back corner of the lab, Cara was trying to hold Sadir together, who was sitting, head between his knees, trying to breathe. Screens blinked. Someone cursed. Someone else asked about the backups.

*Gone.*

*Access logs?*

*A large outbound transfer was made…*

Ben stood in the middle of it all, untouched, as the world blurred around him.

Someone, Ben didn’t register who, pulled him over into the kitchen.

On the back countertop, in perfect Helvetica font, written out in pieces of orange rind, were two words:

>**I quit**

Ben didn’t know how long he stood there, alone in the crowded lab, the scent of citrus still hanging in the air. For once, nothing beeped. Nothing blinked. Just quiet.

He reached out and touched the rind with two fingers. Sticky. Real.

A memory from years ago surfaced, sharp and sudden; he was back standing in his father’s kitchen in the pre-dawn. The note Ben had written and agonized over for hours clenched in his hands. Folding it once he’d placed it under his father’s mug, waiting to be found. He remembered the chill of the morning air as he walked out, the feeling in his chest as he closed the door behind him, leaving behind all that needed to be said.

1nbg5ta,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1nbg5ta/what_growing_up_mormon_was_like/,What growing up Mormon was like,"I see something’s around that are just crazy to me, and I wanted to clear something’s up. Less to drag my neighbors and family, more for a more honest insight into what growing up in an extremely religious community is like. I’m born and raised in Utah, went to BYU, served a 2 year mission, and still live in salt lake today, despite no longer being religious at all.

1. Mormons are varied, more than people think. You don’t get singular types of Mormons. My parents are very active (never miss church, or activities, all friends are Mormon, both went to BYU). Some of my parents friends are red pill republicans. Some others are more traditional democrats. My dad is republican, but both my parents supported gay rights, abortion, and while they don’t think children should be allowed to make physical alterations to their bodies, will use any name anyone wants, and insist on showing people basic respect. They think Trump is entirely insane. But they think the democrats are also insane. My point is that Mormons don’t come in one shape or size. It’s easy to see it as homogenous, but when you get to know people at a deeper level, it’s much less one size fits all.

2. Coffee and tea are not viewed as as bad as murder, as I recently saw. In fact drinking it will likely yield little to no punishment at all. Punishment being asked not to take the sacrament. I know many very active coffee drinkers. Alcohol is more severe, but nowhere near murder. I don’t know why people think that. Coffee and tea aren’t well explained either. Lots of excuses. Basically this “revelation” was added as an addendum to the word of wisdom by a spur-of-the-moment ratification by Brigham young. Who, in my opinion, was a more insane member of the church.

3. Mormons aren’t polygamists. You get kicked out if you do. Long history here, go read about it, but it’s mostly excused. Oh they did it for this reason. Or this reason excuses it. Lots of dead husbands from the journey. The truth is more complicated. There may have been instances of that. There were also a huge number of truly disturbing, pedophilic instances, by leaders in the church and others. It was unpopular in its day, and when (by some very politically convenient revelation) it was removed it was not missed by most. There was a break due to this.

4. Being gay in the church is hard. There’s a lot of acceptance preached in the modern church, but practice is different. Abuse, condemnation, etc. is very common, although decreasing as a younger generation comes of age, but still more common than it should be. Salt lake has a very active gay community, but it’s virtually nonexistent in smaller towns, which is where the worst stories come from. The gay kids in high school were all known to us, and horrible gay jokes were told. It’s not uncommon to know someone kicked out of their family, or who was abused because of their sexuality.

5. There’s a lot of pressure to be active. My friends all were in the church. My family. We saw each other every single Sunday. Going astray was a big deal and could break friendships, and often did. You hit church every Sunday. Always.

6. They did indeed ask young boys and girls about masturbation in bishops interviews. It was gross then and gross now. I “confessed” to masturbating and couldn’t take the sacrament. I told my parents first who sat my down and told me it was natural, and that they didn’t view it as an issue the bishop needed to know about, but I insisted, and I saw the bishop, who was visibly uncomfortable during my interview.

7. There’s temple ceremonies are very boring. No goats. No blood. Loooooong prayers, stories, and wrote commitments. So boring. Probably on youtube. The water in the baptismal font in the temple is warm though, and baptismal for the dead are pretty uneventful. “I baptize you… yada yada… for so and so, who is dead” and you are immersed in the water. That’s it. You do it often as a kid if you’re near a temple.

8. Often members don’t care as much about your choices as you think. I’m openly atheist. My whole block (all Mormon) know. They bring me sour dough bread all the time, never preach, and sometimes ask me interesting questions, and more than one is open to my ideas. I think we tell ourselves people care, and project our own insecurities, and that they judge us, and maybe a few do, but many don’t. I got divorced while a BYU student living at BYU. I felt so judged. Until my best friend actually told me, with love, that no one gave a shit, and I was being sensitive. We’re friends to this day. Great guy.

9. I never knew anyone who docked at BYU, but I’m sure it happened. Did it happen a lot? Don’t know. Dry humping was ravenous. Bagpiping? No idea, but god I like to think so. Mormons are so creative.

10. Trump is not loved everywhere here in Utah. But the democrats are almost culturally hated. It’s a plug your nose thing. Most think he’s an idiot. But not all. Rural Utah loves him.

11. Most Mormons at BYU are at least bi-lingual. Last number I saw was like 60%-70%. I myself am from my mission (Asia) so Mormons actually are very pro immigration largely. Especially refugees. Utah as a state, both legally and culturally, loves refugees. They preach a lot to them. Make what you will of that. But Utah as a state provides a lot of resources other states don’t, and our food banks are always full to bursting.

12. Trans people don’t get much love here, and that’s putting it mildly. Gays may be getting more and more love, but trans people not so. It’s a shame. Regardless on your position on transitioning at what age, it never costs you to be polite.

13. Mormons tend to go waaaaaay too hard when they leave the church. Drugs. Alcohol. Weirdly into coffee. I think it’s a weird rebellion. Caffeine is never mentioned in the WoW, but coffees exclusion is often attributed to this (they don’t sell it at BYU). But Mormons love Diet Coke. So much. Too much.

I’m open to any and all questions. Mormons are like any other group. Good and bad. It’s not as homogenous as people think",1,1757312250.0,atheism,0,1.0,False

Actually making sure things are proper with the presentations literally didn't leave me any time at all to research things that I want to do there outside of the touristy cliche things (I was literally polishing things untill a couple of hours ago).

With that said, I'll be landing in the early morning on the 19th, and the first flight of the trip is pretty soon. I'm so excited to meet your country and share my work, and after all of this hard work it feels like a celebration. I want to make my first lunch in mainland Europe something nice and tasty and I want recommendations from this community if possible since my whole September 19th is free.

I don't eat seafood, unfortunately, and actually prefer vegetarian stuff when possible. I love beer, cheese (the funkier, the better), and bread. Will need some good coffee after lunch as well.

I hope this is not too weird. It's late here and I just can't sleep because I'm too excited. I'll not share too much of my schedule and field so not to dox myself. 

If you don't have lunch recommendations, I'll take any recommendations at all. Schedule will be busy but I'll be around for 4 days trying to experience as much as I can and meet local people whenever possible.

This is a beginning part of a story I am writing called 'The Badlands'.,"The fire resembled an unconsciousness. It resembled the darkness that presents at first. Just before your brain begins to succumb to the grasp it holds. That flash you see right when your inner mind sets up the false wall called a dream. 

I watched as the fire danced around the room, casting shadows of beings that never existed but have always been there. The flame danced so the creatures could stretch their legs and follow suit. Troll in the bedside lamp stomped a rumbling march. The ogre in the jacket hanging on the closet door beat its chest like a war drum. The snakes slithered from the tassels with a rattle. Each creature contributing to the song of madness the candle played. And they loved it.

But, me? I felt fear. Not, love. I wanted the bed to swallow me whole. It tried. I felt like i was sinking into quicksand but it never covered me. Instead of sinking into the satin depths of comfort, I floated like a rejected soul too poor for eternal rest. I looked out the open window wondering if I would still float if I jumped. Would the wind carry me to safety? Or would it drop me into what awaits below?

Like nails on a chalkboard, the foreshadowing, foreboding, lamenting screech of the door brought me back to reality. There is no escape. 

""Rise and shine, sleepyhead. Did you have a good nap?"" Shaina said as she lightly rapped on the door and came in without waiting for a response.

""No."" I responded. 

There was no use in lying. I knew what today was. 

""Well, it's a good thing I brought you coffee!"" She exclaimed in a voice that was way too cheerful for addressing a person contemplating jumping out of a second story window meer heartbeats ago. 

I didn't respond. I just stared at her. We were once friends. I loved her like a sister. If needed, I would have crawled barefoot over lemon juice sprinkled with shattered glass. But, this... This wasn't a need. She wants this. She wants me to suffer. And I dont know why. 

A month ago, she loved me too. But, then she faltered.",1,1757311935.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

**Read Link:** [**https://writers.modapkavatarworld.com/pure-1/**](https://writers.modapkavatarworld.com/pure-1/)

The first time Johnson Burgini cheated, he dropped to his knees, slapping himself across the face, swearing he would never do it again.

The tenth time, he smirked. “Once I’ve had my fun, I’ll still come home.”

By the twentieth, he shoved divorce papers at me like I was nothing.

That night, I ripped them to shreds and smashed every piece of glass in the house.

The thirtieth time, he sent the papers already signed.

So I slit my wrist–just to make him come back. Blood soaked the floor.

No one came.

When I woke, it wasn’t my husband at my side. It was his friends.

“So what if you built everything with him from scratch?”

“He’s already stressed from your depression. Let him play with younger girls. Do you have to cry and pull suicide stunts for this?”

They expected me to beg again. To cling again.

But this time, I picked up the pen. And without hesitation–I signed.

The very next morning, I booked an abortion.

Johnson, I’m done waiting for you to come back.

\*\*

When I got home after the procedure, my lower stomach still throbbed..

Chaper T

My whole body felt like it was being eaten alive by thousands of ants.

I looked at the thousandth “gift” sent by Johnson’s mistress. Their photos -locking eyes, holding hands, kissing, in bed–had already filled an entire storage room.

As soon as I stepped in, a heady scent hit me from the living room. Johnson was back from his business trip.

My eyes landed on the damp stain left on our 50,000–dollar fabric sofa. I gagged, covering my mouth.

“That’s a gift from Julie. Why the ugly face?”

I looked upstairs. There he was, fresh out of the shower.

Following his gaze, I saw a tiny gift box on the coffee table, right next to an empty condom box.

I looked away, pressing through the pain in my stomach, and slowly bent down to change my shoes.

He came down the stairs. “I heard you were looking for me the other day. What was so important that **it** had to be in person?”

My hand instinctively pressed against the meds and surgical report in my bag.

I thought this baby could bring him back. I had called him, heart full of hope, ready to tell him we finally had **a** baby.

But Juliette Cameron answered.

She laughed and told me that just moments before, Johnson had pulled down her strap and, breathless with desire, said he wanted a baby with

her.

Chapter 1

The blow triggered another episode.

After I hung up, I couldn’t stop my hand from reaching for the blade and cutting my wrist.

But now, I just shook my head at him.

My MILs siamese keeps trying to run outside.,"Hello everyone, I don't know how to start this post so I'll just do my best to be right on point. My Mother in law has gotten a Siamese kitten when it was very small. It has been with her for 5 months (he is now almost 7m.o) and recently she got into pension. He is a very stubborn and naughty kitty and likes to get in trouble to see our reaction. Ever since he turned 4months old he bas been trying to escape the house. My MIL has a big yard as she lives in a village, although it isn't very safe as he could get out if he wanted to. He never tried to get in the direction of the road as he's scared of cars but at the other side of the yard there's a small forest that he ran towards yesterday. My MIL didn't notice he got out and when she did, she decided to let him be as she usually let's him out for short intervals, for example until she drinks coffee. This time, I don't know why, she didn't pay as much attention to him. As far as I understood, it was because she was cleaning the corridor where he was mainly at and decided to let It ventilate. After Which he has been gone for an hour. We have been trying to find him for that long, that is. In the end, we managed to find him as he came back closer to the house entrance. My question is, what could we do to prevent this. He keeps trying to exist through the small gap of the door opening and between our legs when we enter/exit. We tried getting a playpen for him ever since he was little, but he kept destroying it. My MIL wants to go on a vacation for a few days and would have to make her parents come feed him as me and my husband live in a different city in a small apartment and too have a cat, which my Mother-in-law's Siamese doesn't like and vice versa... We are trying to get solutions both long term and temporary... Thank you.",1,1757311887.0,Siamesecats,0,1.0,False
1nbg1ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1nbg1ic/getting_disciplined_is_easy_first_discern_what/,Getting disciplined is easy first discern what needs to be done and when and then worry about how exactly a long the way. Lastly keep this mindset consistent.,"To prove disciplined is easy, you are forced to be disciplined at your job. The environment enforces your behavior a certain way to perform your job at a proficient level. 

In regards to my method, it's about a proposed mental environment model to use, to get disciplined. 

Here is how this looks like. 

The scenario: Just got home after work....

What you typically feel at this time: I'm tired, want to go to sleep, and I also want to play games or do something fun and eat something etc. 

The switch: Acknowledged what you feel ^^^ then let it slowly pass away while implementing the mental model 
1. Assessment all of what you can see visually such as dirty room or knowledgeably know such as debt but point is do assessment of all or most problems. 
2. After you stop doing assessments, choose what to prioritize. For me I prioritize based on urgency such ""take a shower and wash work clothes for work"" it's urgent to do that and I believe we as humans always prioritize based on urgency proof is when nature calls you go to the bathroom. But I don't think doing things based on urgency is best exactly because it's needed to be a self started towards important things like creating a savings account and paying off debt etc. 
3.after you prioritize, you when is basically there already it's the how to figure out and that when you must trust in you ability to do certain things, to learn and grow and achieve. And the way to do that is using problem solving skills so whatever problem it is or goal use your problem solving skills to get to point A to point B. For example, small problems or achievements you don't think to deeply about because to easy peasy. Like making a sandwich. Try to stay alert for next time you find a creative solution to something, at a unexpected time, for example if there is no toliet paper, you may get creative and use recipient paper in your pocket. Get what I'm saying? Humans are natural problem solvers. So trusting your instincts may be needed to get confident and so on towards things. 
4. To add you must ACT. I do a example on that later. But 4th is actually keeping this consistent mindset. We'll have ability to employ this mindset when needed. At least. I don't think keeping a consistent mindset like this is possible. What I do know is it is possible to set a routine for yourself to obey and I believe that's the best way to stay disciplined is to optimize a routine on power or a app to follow by that I mean time blocking every hour or minute of your day. And I have done that myself and the first requirement of doing that is setting. A bed time and wake up time for yourself that is a sufficient amount of sleep. Then you can do all the fluff well the other stuff like make coffee, make up bed etc. and ideally ina future pay people to do certain tod ree up your time. Like when I was having a very strict with my routine I drank instant coffee and toast and oatmeal and would bake my dinner such baked potatos or chicken breast. I was counting calories at the time. The other thing is if you become a super high acheiver meaning getting everything clean everything done what's left is to workout actually or to waste time consuming excess food or entertainment but I actually had my entertainment lock in with my work routine, I did a pomo doro type thing where I work for a hour and then watch anime for 25 mins and be on and off. But I was making slow progress with work. 

And that's my issue with discipline not being effective enough, not being influential enough to do things my way. Idk how to explain it. But you are either following or leading I believe now. By following I mean you are in a position where always uses you or manipulates you to a degree. By leading I mean you do what you want when you want. If you hesitate in a simple decision to take the bus to work or a under to work or to walk outside and enjoy the rain because you are second thinking yourself you are likely under the influence of others and not solely in charge of your domain of mind. Thus the reason is said earlier doing things based on urgency is not always best because others could have obligated you to care and do things for them. 

Anyways I help my advice help other advice is get busy with cleaning and try fasting to get in the grind mindset to achieve great things and get serious and keep a clean diet meaning drinking. Water and not junk food. And the moment you break your clean diet it's a sign you are getting off track and derailing 

The other thing is time flies by really fast like super fast with that said. Read this carefully, 

Do your best to lose 2 pounds in 2 weeks by simply walking more and being lightly active taking stairs vs elevator and no soda and eating a bit less. 

Flash forward 2 weeks of nothing was acheive it's because you did not focus on anything. 

So I'm saying everything is just a matter of time. Learn to focus on the right things. 

The other thing is I work harder for my. Job. The I do on myself and I'm trying. Work hard on myself now and this is the method I come up with. 

Comment the great things you will achieve in 2 weeks from now or something. ",1,1757311819.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

My friend is a good person, we have much in common and very interesting conversations. We work at the same place and our friendship is kinda close. I say ""kinda"", because the lifestyle of my friend leaves little room for having coffee or a longer chats together. On one hand, they often suggest spending quality time ""some day"", on the other - that happens very rarely (think once in few months, or once in a couple of years - having in mind we meet at least once a week at the workplace). I find it exhausting, because I actually look forward for those and it's disappointing not being able to connect sometimes. At the time we're in the state of conflict (I've been ghosted, then I responded too harshly), but I know we will mend it: it's not the first time. But ""not the first time"" also means we have those conflicts reappearing: me being needy in friendship, they having periods when they wanna isolate themselves and explaining lack of contact with their feeling low or being very busy. The level of busyness is their choice - they are in control of taking extra tasks and scheduling. But for years work always comes first. I love our work, it's very important for me too, but I feel our friendship is unequal. I don't want to end it (unless they would initiate that), but I am also tired of switching between having heartfelt conversations and fun time and periods of being distant. I feel we need a transition to a friendship with lower expectations and less contact. I need to be more open and let my friend go and don't care about me when they need to focus on different things. But it's hard. Maybe anyone have been in similar situations and has practical advice? P.S. If that is relevant, I am 42, friend is 37, both straight and of same gender, no romantic undertones.

Lately, I've been thinking abuot silence. Not just the absence of noise, but the kind of deep sience you find in nature—like when you find yourself sitting by a quiet lake at dawn, or in a thick forest where even the busiest squirrels seem to take a moment's puse.

Have you ever wondered if these silences have a voice of their own? It fees like they do, somehow conveying stories and emotions without a single word. Maybe they reflect our own need for moments of peace amidst the chaos we call daily life? 

I was listening to a song while waliing my dog the oher day, and it struck me how certain notes just kind of drift off into their own echo, leaving behind a trail of silecne that oddly enough, completes the song. It's like the universe's way of saying, ""Hey, take a moment to just be."" 

In a world that's often too loud, these moments seem kinda precious, almost sqcred. I guess what I'm trying to say is, maybe we should give these silences a bit more credit. Do they have something to teach us, you tihnk? Idk, but it's something I'll keep pondering over my morning coffee.

Nora Makes Sheila Her Slave Receptionist, Writes Her Into The Show In The Most Humiliating Way Possible, Until Mary's Proposal Doubles Down.","Nora's Perspective 

Okay, I was working on this great new script idea for Perseverance.  And I got to cast Sheila as a villain. A masked latex 
suited ""Warrior Slave"" working for a mysterious extra-temporal faction. Even though she's in charge of some renegade Amazonians and scruffy male ruffians, she's a helot  of an unknown group trying to manipulate the Alliance-Compact war. I want to insert vague hints right  now  she's from the far  future, possibly an alternate timeline. Her costume would be a modified version of one of Katie's high-tech slave suits. So maximum control and humiliation on set, with a ton of screen time. I wanted to make sure she got credited, so I could show her the threads in fan forums discussing her ""performance"". I giggled at how much fun I was going to  have with my second favorite sub (My sweetie Sarah is always #1) and mentor.

You may ask, Nora, what do you have against Sheila, that you enjoy humiliating her? Nothing, I love her to pieces! But I'm a domme, and she's one of my subs now. And, okay now that I'm a screenwriter, I get to pay her back for that strip show I had to do for the episode when Commander Gail drank a mind altering drug used by sex workers on the planet Minos. Her character is badass, sexy, but behind the scenes she'd be under my thumb, completely! It was going to be so hot!

Well, actually not exactly my thumb. That was part of the fun!

Speaking of humiliations, I was getting a buzzing on my computer screen. My little bondage receptionist was trying to alert me of something from my newly partitioned Office foyer. If you guessed my adorable new receptionist was Sheila Nguyen Connor, you get a cookie! I'll make her wait a minute or so, just to make her sweat what kind of mood I was in.

Yeah, Sheila was irked when I proposed her new position. But I told her it wasn't just to reinforce our Mistress and Slave dynamic. Now that I was writing, I wanted her close for consultation. As with a lot of things, she showed me I had the potential to write, like so many other things she helped me with. Slave or no, I valued her thoughts on my endeavors, a lot. Might as well keep her close throughout the day. Besides, after all that training we sent her to at QOM's compound, might as well have her doing something besides shuffling around for Sandy's gophers. Having a pretty little piece to ogle when I got bored didn't hurt, either. 

She was hooded and wearing a head to toe gimp suit, with her ass, tits, and pussy hanging out. It was a ""light-tech"" version of the high tech slave suits. Hydration bladder, remote inflatable gag, and an ear Mike. She was restrained to a very comfortable adjustable chair, arms strapped to the rests at her wrists, legs strapped to the padded base. She could lean her head back on a very nice head and neck cushion. Their was an optional forehead strap, but I hadn't used it yet. She had a button under her left hand to adjust her chair position for comfort. Under her right were a button to initiate Zoom communications on her desktop, and a panic button to alert myself and security in an emergency.

She had an engraved ""Slave Zero"" plaque on her desk. And her framed certificate from Queen of Mean declaring her a ""Quality Bottom Slave."" I still giggled at how pissed she looked when I told her that was going to be displayed prominently on her desk. Tough, baby, everyone is going to know Mistress Nora's receptionist slave is certified by QOM as a ""Quality Bottom.Slave"". Just a matter of course.

I picked up the video call. A hooded face with pretty, exotic hazel eyes peeping out filled the screen, right above a set of delicious breasts poking out of her suit.
She had a big desktop monitor, and I made sure on her end the volume was loud and my face filled her screen. For fun pranks like this. I put on a stern domme glare.

""I'm busy, Slave! Why are you bothering me, you little worm?! Well, speak, don't just sit there with your naked breasts hanging out all day!"" Two pretty brown eyes look nervous and flustered. I feel bad when I can see her trying to push down her understandable terror of ""Mistress Nora"" when I'm cranky.

""Iswessh Ora, Uh orry u other uuuu, ut-"" (Mistress Nora, I'm sorry to bother you, but-) I felt bad for forgetting to deflate her gag before ordering her to speak. I hold up my hand, my signal to silence my subs. She goes quiet, eyeing me nervously. I put on the biggest, most reassuring smile I can.

""It's okay sweetie. I was just funning you. I know you wouldn't bother me unless it's urgent."" Her eyes get annoyed, and she gives an adorable muffled hmmmph, staring at me defiantly. She's just so delicious when she gets an attitude while helpless. I wish I was in the room so I could tap her pert little nose with my index finger.

I keep the smile on as I use her suit remote to deflate her gag. ""I know you're momma and daddy taught you not to talk with your mouth full, honey. To be fair, I sometimes make you girls do that, so I can't blame you."" I giggle. Behind her hood, Sheila glares as I noticed  her working her newly free mouth behind the hood panel, preparing to speak.

I got a stern but (hopefully not to-threatening look), and her smartass retort dies. ""Report, slave."" I demand. To her credit, Sheila adopts her calm, professional demeanour I noticed the first day I met her as Chief Screenwriter on the set. Slave Sheila is going to give a proper report to her Mistress. Despite her bonds, she even tries to straighten up in her cushioned bondage chair. 

""Mistress Nora, Mistress Mary notified me that she wanted to drop by in a half hour to discuss the script you're writing. She's intrigued by some elements, and wants to make a proposal to you about it. She respectfully asks you text her directly if you can't meet, or want to reschedule."" She falls silent, but her eyes are asking me when I am going to share my script with her. When I feel like it, slave.

I admit, it is just a pure power move. Now that I am her boss, I decide when she gets to read one of MY scripts. I'll share it with whom I please, when I please. (Ok, if Sandy, Constance, Lara or Dave ask I usually have to cave). I felt a little thrill of sadistic pleasure at her knowing I share my work with her current nemesis before I shared it with her bound, nude slave ass. I'm the Boss Bitch now, Sheila.

I give her a small smile. ""Thank you, sweetie. I'll text Mary and let her know she can drop by in a half hour. Good work. But I'd expect nothing less from you, hon."" Her eyes twinkle with pleasure from her Mistress's praise. She really is a natural sub at heart. 

""Do you need a bathroom break? I can text Sandy and have her take you?"" Sheila replys ""No, thank you Mistress."" My smile gets bigger. ""Ok. Anything you need, Sheila?""

""No. But may I speak freely, Mistress?"" Oh, no. I wonder if she is going to chastise me for my little ""psych out"" when I took her call. Lara and Constance demanded Slaves Zero and Border Bunny give me blunt feedback, even as slaves. It was as much to correct them as me. Our current Top Dommes felt Sheila and Layla failed me by not reining me in and bawling me out for my excessive cruelty when they were our leaders. It was a teaching tool for all three of us, they learn how to give constructive criticism to me, and I learn how to take it. Even with me being their superior now instead of vise versa. I have to admit it was a growth experience for all three of us. Yeah, I couldn't punish them for anything they said when they had permission to speak freely. Credit to my pretties for being constructive and professional, so far. I admit with me as their domme, it couldn't always be easy. But it was appreciated.

""Sure, sweetie. What's on your mind?"" I triy to keep my smile reassuring, sometimes, Sheila especially, they needed really gentle, nurturing domming.

""Mistress Nora. I'm really proud of you. You've turned into a good boss, a great writer, and an excellent domme. Both Layla and I neglected important parts of our responsibilities as leaders to you. But I'm proud under Constance and Lara, even Sandy, you're blossoming. I'm proud of you, Nora, I mean it.""

My smile widens. Now it was my turn to bask in my mentor's praises. ""Thank you, sweetie. That means a lot. You and Layla had your flaws, but every day I walk into this office, I know I never could have done it without you and Layla teaching me women can do great things, even in a man's world. I mean that. I'd probably still be a meek little subby, or in prison for exploding on someone, if not for Boss Bitch and the Jarhead."" Our eyes meet with mutual admiration and affection.

Then I look down at my draft script. One more review before Mary arrives. ""I'm going to regag you now, slave, buzz me as soon as Mary gets here."" The gag reinflated quickly when I press the button. She garbles out ""Ess, Ishwesh ara.""
I disconnect the call and bring my script back up.

I had her alert me to Mary's presence to monitor Mary  teasing her while she waited. The blonde PAWG pretended it was good natured, but it had a nasty streak of pure malice in it. Mary had never crossed a line yet, but she danced on it's very edge.

Okay, quick review of my Character sketch and script.

The character would be named Choejeo, though her scruffy crew call her  ""C"". Choejeo is Korean for ""The Lowest"" despite her seemingly dominant position.
Kang will remark on the meaning of it at the end of the episode, and ASSHO will speculate she's the slave of a far future faction trying to manipulate history.

The suit will be slightly different then most of Katie's supplier's high tech gimp gear. There'd be a cutout for Sheila's sleek black hair in a pony tail, her panel gag would look like a voice grill, plus she'd have high tech monocle's that could be pulled down over either eye.

She wouldn't have to worry about lines, as I was thinking of several pro dommes, former colleagues of Constance, who'd reached out for a guest spot on the Perseverance. They'd speak the lines and domme Sheila on set. If we could find someone who had good chemistry with Sheila, could follow our rules, and learn the slave suits controls quickly.

I pictured the credits, for the domme we hire to speak the character's lines. I wanted to be sure the voice actor and domme was credited and Sheila wasn't, to make it clear she's just a prop. It would ve leaked way ahead of time the girl in the suit is Shiela, to start humiliating threads on fan forums making fun of her and objectifying her. She'd been a lively topic of discussion lately, this would kick it into overdrive. I chuckle another layer of humiliation and objectification for my mentor. She dished it out as Chief Screenwriter, now she could take some of her own medicine. 

Another plot thread I was working on was ASSHO reverting to a child like state. Choejoe takes over the ship, and takes a particular interest in ASSHO, wanting to find something in her cybernetically enhanced brain. the procedure backfires and ASSHO reverts to a childlike state. Choejoe orders her taken back to her quarters in disgust, as they've locked the entire crew in their staterooms and squadbays. The villainess does backhand one of her men in disgust when he suggests ""having a little fun"" with the traumatized cyborg girl.

From the script:

(Two pirates throw a sobbing ASSHO on her bed in her bra and panties. She pulls open her dresser drawer, pulls out a stuffed kitten, then curls up with it, obviously terrified and traumatized. She looks startled when Kang jumps down from a maintenance duct, then delighted when she recognizes him).

Kang: ASSHO, my dear, are you alright-

(ASSHO jumps off her bunk and hugs a startled Kang, still clutching her toy kitten.)

ASSHO: Appa  Kang! I was so scared, that mean lady in the scary costume and those bad men were hurting me! You're going to make them go away, right?

Kang: (Looking worried and concerned, but staying calm) We're going to do just that, but Appa needs you to be brave.
(ASSHO looks scared again when Gail jumps down from the duct)

ASSHO: Who-who's she?

(Kang and Gail exchange knowing looks)

Kang: Dora, she's-


Gail: (Grim) I know, regressed again. I saw it in Korea.

(Awkward silence as Kang looks guilty, Dora looks a little chagrined at mentioning, Korea. ASSHO seems to lose her fear of Gail as Kang shows his familiarity with the Captain, even stare at her intently)

ASSHO: You're really pretty. Are you one of my Appa's special friends? I mean really special?

(Gail turns a look on Kang, who shrugs sheepishly. She then puts on a friendly s
face and speaks softly to the childlike ASSHO)

Gail: I'm the Captain, honey. My crew calls me Gail, but you can call me Dora.

ASSHO: My Appa says girls can't be Captains! He says we're too emotional and would crash the ship!

(Now Gail glares at Kang hard. He looks even more sheepish as ASSHO examines Gail's disheveled uniform with interest)

Gail: (Coldly) Your ""Appa"" is wrong, honey.

Kang: (Meekly) You know I don't believe that anymore, Gail (Then he remembers ASSHO's mind may have regressed, but her body is that of a voluptuous young woman, hugging him in her underwear) Uh, lets get you some clothes, yobo.

ASSHO: (Excitedly) Can I wear a uniform just like Captain Gail's, Appa? 

Gail: As a matter of fact we have some just your size, honey. (Gail gently disengages her traumatized friend from Kang, leading her to her wardrobe closet. Kang walks over to ASSHO's computer terminal, frowning. He's trying to think of a way to use it to help free the crew and take the ship back.)

I hear my phone buzz and pick it up. A private text from Sandy.

Sandy: Just saw Mary headed to your office.

Nora: Thanks.

Sandy: You think that bitch is going to fuck with my sister? I feel like I should stop her.

Nora: She hasn't crossed any lines yet, she's within her rights to tease and mess with Sheila as one of her designated dommes. I don't want her to know she's being watched, so if she crosses a line we have evidence. Then I'll STOP her. So far, she's cruel but subtle.

Sandy: I know, I trust you with Sheila, Nora. Thanks.

Nora: No thanks needed, she's part of our little family, even as a sub.

Sandy: Bye 👋 

Nora: Bye, Sexy Sandy. 💋 

Sandy: 💋. 

I turn on the concealed camera to watch Mary walk in the foyer holding a cardboard coffee cup.  Sheila immediately greets her ""Eeetings Iswess Ary, wave ero es eaer ooo erve u!"" Greetings Mistress Mary, Slave Zero is eager to serve you!
It was flawless for a gagged girl. Mary just leans against the door jamb and covers a fake yawn with her free hand. Really? We go to all that trouble to certify you as a quality bottom slave and that's the best you can do, Sheila? So pathetic.""

She makes Sheila repeat her greeting twice before rolling her eyes and holding

 out her hand. ""Just stop, slave. When you page Mistress Nora, inform her Mistress Mary is recommending you for a refresher Bottom Slave course at Queen Of Mean's compound. And here I brought you something, your favorite coffee, French Vanilla! I ought to pour it out, but I'm just too generous, even to lazy slaves."" She places the cup where the aroma is sure to wait under Sheila's nose. Of course, it's just a cruel act to taunt Sheila with something she enjoys, just out of her reach. Sometimes I feel this has gone past karmic payback for Sheila's blind eye to my cruelty, Mary is clearly enjoying the power dynamic, a little too much.

""Oh, did that silly kid forget to strap your head in? Our little Nora has come such a long way, but she's still so absentminded sometimes. I'll help her out."" Mary grabs the head strap, and tightens it across Sheila's forehead, being rougher then needed adjusting head and strap. ""There, all firmly restrained. Now you can contact your domme. Don't forget to tell her I recommend you for refresher Bottom Slave training."" She flicks Sheila's framed ""Quality Bottom Slave"" Certificate. ""You don't deserve this on your desk, if it was up to me I'd tear it up."" Sheila's eyes blaze and I'm pretty sure her jaw tightens under the hood. As much as she hates that certificate, she hates being told she's failing at a task even more.

I clear the feed and a call buzzes on my desktop. I deflate Sheila's gag with the remote before I take it. Sheila's eyes are still angry, but her tone is professional.

""Good afternoon, Mistress Nora, the Honorable Mistress Mary is here to see you. The Honorable Mistress Mary recommends this slave for Refresher Bottom Slave Training at Queen Of Mean's compound, for inadequate performance of my slave duties as your bondage receptionist.""

""I see, slave. Thank you for notifying me about Mistress Mary. We'll discuss your poor performance tonight before I release you."" I winked, my way of telling her don't worry about it. Mary must be already heading to my door, because the hooded girl winks back. ""Yes, Mistress Nora."" I'm leaving her gag deflated for the rest of the day, she's earned that.

A cheery ""Knock, knock."" When I tell her to come in, Mary strides through, wearing the sharp powder blue skirt suit which is the unofficial business uniform of Queen of Mean's crew when they're not in domme glare. Her smile is radiant, her new position as one of QOM's lead dommes agrees with her.

""How's things over at the compound?"" I ask by way of small talk as I gesture her to a seat. ""Great. We're really making headway getting Slave Border Bunny Pet Play certified. It's more we can have her do when you send her over. And it keeps her tied down to the Bottom Slave position nicely. No one wants to be the Pony Girl at one of Queen Of Means parties. As long as we have that Hispanic dyke and a couple of others qualified and available, no one else has to worry about it."" She was clearly ecstatic being able to humiliate her two former nemesis so utterly.

""Don't get too used to her, we need her back as a freewoman for this upcoming episode. Can't save a hijacked ship without a security chief. Well, I guess you could, but it's more of a stretch."" Mary almost seems to pout for a moment, then brightens.

""That's actually what I came here to talk about. I'd like to be the voice of Choejeo, and Sheila's on set domme. I have a few proposals for your approval. I know what you're thinking, this is just my excuse to humiliate her more, you're half right. But I do have ideas to help the show creatively, and I'd like to try my hand at a different villain then my dark mirror universe self. You know you're just using Sheila as a prop, you're having fun humbling her. Whoever voices the character is the character.""

""Here's the rub, despite how well trained she is now, once she reads the script, you know she's going to realize she's just a sexualized prop, and resent it. I know you Nora, you'll make sure she knows she's not credited, her on set domme and voice actor is. But I know you'll leak who's in the suit to all the fan forums ahead of time. She hates  being the dirty joke of the fan forums, and is going to hate she's just a puppet to boost the voice actor of the character. Add that you plan to have the voice actor be her domme. It's such a brilliant humiliating touch, but you know it might push her into being a brat and making things difficult. Not saying you gals and Constance couldn't handle her...""

""But, you Mistress Mary, think you can handle her better."" My statement made her smile. ""I've been here before and worked with all of you before. I know precisely how to motivate Sheila as a sub, and keep her in line. I know her, but we're not friends, so I can make her toe the line, being hard as I need too. I know it might break your hearts to whip her into obedience if she gets disobedient, it will be my unashamed pleasure. And you know the fans will love it, me doing to her in this season what she did to me at the end of the first, through the second season, making her be the a fetish prop to advance the narrative. Choejoe is a badass character, but I'll be associated with her, Sheila will just get razzed and objectified on the fan forums. Nora, I hate to say this, but not only does Sheila owe me, but so do you. Don't get me wrong, I know you were just a naive kid being mislead by the clique mean girl, that's why I'm content to give her the worst of it and treat you as a peer. But after all the mean things you did to me, you can't grant me this one favor on the show I created, that made all of your careers?""

And here it was, the guilt trip ""You bitches stole my show, and treated me like shit."" The thing is, she's absolutely right. Sheila wasn't the clique mean girl, she often tried to help Mary and even voted for her not to be my permanent slave. But she didn't have the ovaries to stand up to Dave when I was being excessively cruel, because her career wasn't worth the risk (The irony being, if she'd tried, Dave would probably have caved. But she decided Mary being an abused prop on the show she created was acceptable collateral damage, while we cashed in, and Mary got not a penny due to her arrangement with Dave. Considering I actually inflicted most of her abuse, it's hard for me to see her as a villainess here, or her request as unfair. Even her petty cruelties to Shiela are kindness compared to what I did to her. Yeah, she'd probably make Sheila miserable all through shooting an episode. But we made her miserable for a whole season. Of her original project.

I sighed. I'm sorry, Sheila, but you'll just have to suck it up, (No pun intended). Fair is fair, my little bare ass receptionist taught me that. ""You know Dave, Layla and Lara will have to approve. Sandy too, most likely. For what it's worth, I'll support it. If you stay within our guidelines for handling subs.""

That pretty smile again. ""I already met with your big three before I came to see you. They didn't look happy, but they approved. They wanted me to see you to help teach you about making hard decisions involving subordinates who are also friends. But they were certain you'd make the right choice."" I could see all three of them having the same internal monologue as me. And reluctantly concluding what Mary is asking is fair, even Karmic, if serving up Sheila an extra scoop of humiliation. One more hope.

""And Sandy?"" That smile didn't waver a notch. ""We're having dinner tomorrow, just the two of us, my treat. If anything, she's more fair minded then all of you, I'm sure I can convince her."" I took in Mary's confidence with a sinking feeling for my former mentor. Sandy did have an unshakable ethical core. Mary was probably going to sway her, sister or no. Sorry, Sheila, just wanted to have a little fun at your expense. Now...I'd do a fan poll if I thought it would spare Sheila Mary as her domme, taking all the credit and barking orders while Sheila sweltered in her slavesuit. But I know how our fans would vote..

I was given a Breville Grinder Pro and a Moccamaster (pretty sweet combo). The drip coffee is great, but I’m also a big latte and mocha guy. Since I’ve already got the grinder, I’m looking at picking up a used Breville espresso machine.

Options I’ve found:

Infuser for $400

Duo-Temp Pro for $270


Most of what I’ll be making is lattes and mochas for my wife, kids (decaf), and myself. I’ll probably get into cappuccinos and other drinks later. I also have a Nespresso frother.

For anyone who’s owned these machines:
Is the Infuser worth the extra cash over the Duo-Temp Pro?

Any big differences in steaming power or convenience for milk drinks?
Anything else I should consider at this price point?

That jolted me back from dreamland into reality. Not that I can venture into the Sandman's realm anyways, but that is a story for another time.

The night earlier, me and my friends were celebrating the 25th anniversary of the arrival of a dear friend at a nearby joint. Free wheeling conversations, finger food and filter coffee to top the night off. I woke up with a breath of regret lingering, that I might have overstepped on my macros part more than I'd have liked to, but I remembered a particular slang oft quoted by my younger ilk. YOLO has perhaps driven me to do things which I'd rather choose eating raw shrimp over (although I perhaps talked into the same in a more nebulous state, because YOLO?).

I flail around to find around my phone and fumble it as I fiddle with it. I needed to see which capitalist entity was at least partially responsible for notching down my Monday morning. The usual suspects, I sigh. Medicine apps designed to target a much older demographic who are probably early birds. I sigh to myself, as I make a mental note not to use my rectangle of never-ending distraction first thing in the morning.

Next stop, my resident friend, philosopher, and guide, the all knowing harbinger of information overload: my go-to AI app. I hastily type in my inebriated intake from last might as it scrambles its servers to deliver me a roadmap to adjust my calorific intake accordingly. Doable, I say to myself, although I know I am susceptible to YOLO-ing far too often, particularly when my silver tongued friends are in the mix.

I then open WhatsApp to see a flurry of texts. That's when I saw it. Around 10 unread texts from law school alumni , the last of them being ""Rest in Peace"". I click on the group to see if a particularly senior faculty might have succumbed to some illness, as that seemed in that moment as the most probable. 

But it was him, a year my senior, gone too soon. I wasn't particularly besties with him. But something about that hurt.

I also want a vacuum that can do a solid job with edge cleaning since dust and crumbs tend to build up along the walls and corners,especially in my kitchen. Another thing that would help is if it can fit under the sofa so I do not have to keep moving furniture whenever I find snacks left behind after my weekend party with friends.



Since I work long hours during the week, I need something that can take care of itself without getting stuck all the time.

I am writting to you in behalf of my mom. 20 years ago, my cousin, the only child of her sister, died tragically and brutally at 22yo. Two days ago it was his anniversary and my mom was at my aunt house to keep the dogs (while my aunt was away). Around 5pm, the electricity went off briefly then when coming back 3 machines started to work (oven light, cooking robot and the coffee machine was pouring water). My mom thought nothing special of that. 

Then between that moment and 10pm, the bell rang 3 times, with no one on the camera (they live in a remote place, with no one passing there). 

When she went to bed around midnight she opened her phone to play Scrabble. The 7 letters given to her (randomly by the computer) spelled exactly the name of my cousin. She was shocked and went to speak to him near his ashes and picture. 

My mom isn't someone who believes in paranormal and my aunt is even more ""rational"". 

My question to you is what to do with this ? To me it seems strange to receive this type of manifestation 20 years after the death. What are your thoughts of this ? Thank you. 

Ps: several years ago my aunt received two phone calls from my cousin's, two years appart, with no one responding on tge other end. And when trying to call back the operator said this mumber wasn't in service.",1,1757310452.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False
1nbfnnc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nbfnnc,New GR IIIx,"TLDR; my younger sister likes my photos and said I should look into getting a camera. Seeing as most of my photos are traveling, I settled on the GR IIIx. 

New to photography, new to cameras, new to sharing photos with strangers. 

I decided on the GR IIIx because of the cult following, form factor, and price. After a couple weeks of shooting with it, 40mm feels a bit tight for me but I think it’s a good place to start. 

The back story: 

I travel a good bit for work and bring my bicycle with me everywhere. On a trip last year I saw a gentleman riding with a full frame camera on a sling during a group ride and thought it was the coolest thing ever. Traveling and cycling present a lot of great photo opportunities— I often share with my significant other and family some of the places I’ve been and things I’ve seen. It helps us feel connected, inspires them, and maybe broadens their horizons. Maybe that’s a bit sentimental, but, sharing with my youngest sister has always been a joy. She loves my photos and inspired me to get a camera. 

Use case: 

I like to travel, I enjoy cycling and many other activities, and I like to take photos. Sometimes I enjoy sharing. I think once I’ve got a bit more experience under my belt I’ll get something with different lenses options, larger sensor, etc.. until then I’m running with the old adage of, “the best  camera is the one you have.” 

How it’s going so far: 

If it wasn’t clear, I don’t know shit about cameras or photography but I’ve always enjoyed taking photos. I’ve always thought it wasn’t so much about the photographer, but really opportunity that makes a photo great. What I mean by that is I’ve taken plenty of cool photos with the latest a iPhone that I was only able to get because I was in a specific place at a specific time. Although I still find that to be true, I’m realizing skill and experience will go a looooong way. And after seeing many of the great photos here, I’ve also concluded that it doesn’t require a Leica to capture the moment. 
Since picking up my camera about three weeks ago, my goal is to take it with me everywhere and just take photos. Doing this I’ll become comfortable framing things, adjusting things within exposure triangle, and I’ll have lots of photos to review. So far they’re all shit, but it’s been a fun new hobby that I’m gonna keep working at.

Per my last post, my (F24) stepsister (F27) got married last December, she asked for my wedding dress after not wanting to even look for one herself. I said no, I stood my ground and I didn’t go to her wedding. Fast forward to last month, she and her husband have separated. She says they are only “taking a break”. 

I begun to rebuild my relationship with her, I took time and effort to find a way to talk to her and even go out in double dates with his husband and mine’s. That went really well, up until the break she took with her hubby. She stopped talking to me altogether, ghosted me when I wanted to plan stuff and I figured she only needed some time.

Up until she calls me again, in the middle of August. She wants to come over to my house and talk. I genuinely felt happy to have her come over, since my stepdad kept pressuring to finally make peace. She comes over, we have coffee and she asks to see my closet since she was going out on a date and had nothing to wear. I thought this was full circle moment for both us, so I said yes. 

We looked through my clothes and I picked something that went well with her. She said thanks and put the outfit in a bag she brought with her, and left.

Some days pass, and as I was cleaning my own closet I find that the spot where my wedding dress was hanging from, was empty. It was in a garment bag and it was there since I don’t want it to wrinkle so bad since the fabric was a little fragile. 

I freaked out, searched for it everywhere. I realized the last time I saw it was before my stepsister came. I called her and asked sincerely in case I was wrong, she got extremely defensive and hung up the phone. I called my stepdad, he was angry at me for thinking she could do that. 

Later, my stepdad calls again. He got my stepsister to tell the truth. She stole it while I was looking for an outfit for *her*. He tells me to calm down and to resolve this like adults, but I called her again and simply said to prepare her lawyers.

This created massive drama within my family, and I was too livid to acknowledge it until my mom called me. Now, I’m thinking I may be crossing a line, but that dress means too much for me. I saved every penny I got and it truly was the dress of my dreams. I’m scared to find out if she did anything to it.

*“You sure this is the right place, Hank?”* I shouted from outside the limousine.

The husky chauffeur didn’t respond, attention transfixed on his handheld television, fiddling with the antennae to minimize static. A cold October wind howled through the valley, causing the slit of my black dress to flutter against my thigh. Frustration mounted behind my eyes as I waited for an answer, glaring through the passenger’s side window while shivering from the violent squall.

Getting the sense that he was intentionally ignoring me, I pulled trembling fists from the pockets of my wool coat and improvised a drum solo against the thick glass. My knuckles were so cold that I barely felt them make contact.

The amateur rendition of Van Halen’s *“Hot For Teacher”* was enough to get his attention. A scowl curled up the side of his face. Without moving his eyes away from the blinking screen, Hank leaned over to roll down the window, his beer gut flopping awkwardly over the central console like a pillowcase half filled with maple syrup. He gave the crank two lazy twists, and the window creaked down a few inches.

*“Robin - what the fuck is the matter? It’s the goddamned World Series,”* he said, pointing at the small TV and acting like I was unaware of that fact. Hank had nearly careened off the road multiple times on the thirty-minute drive over here, seemingly unable to drag his eyes away from the game for more than a handful of seconds at a time.

I felt a myriad of insults thump against the back of my teeth, begging to be unleashed, but I swallowed the annoyance.

*“Can you please just look at the sign?”* I pleaded, gesturing to the name listed above a picture of the deceased.

*“…’85 wasn’t our year, but ‘87…’87 is for The Cardinals…”* he muttered, still glued to the feed.

*“Hank, for the love of God, confirm that I’m walking into the right funeral or I’m getting back into the car. I was told the guy’s name was ""‘John’, not ‘Jom’. The damn sign says ‘Jom’.”* I snapped.

Hank slumped his shoulders with childlike exaggeration and sighed. Reluctantly, he shoved a meaty claw into the breast pocket of his blazer, digging around for the instructions given to him by our escort agency. With a crumpled slip of paper in hand, his pupils finally detached from the game. Hastily, he scanned the name and date.

*“Looks right to me,”* he remarked. Before I could ask to see it too, he spat chewing tobacco that had been resting along his gumline into the slip. My eyes widened in disbelief as I watched Hank wrap the paper around the brown-black ichor, only to then toss the malformed lump into his coffee cup.

*“Christ, Hank. You couldn’t have just handed it to me, like a human being? Or are you not a human being? Maybe you're actually some human-shaped donkey? Does that sound right?”*

The insult finally brought his eyes to meet mine. Instead of anger, he shot me a threatening grin. A wolf’s smile, bearing hungry canines in my direction.

*“Look, doll - how about you tiptoe those fragile, porcelain feet up to the home’s concierge and ask about the service? I’ll wait here. If it ain’t right, we’ll go back to the office.”*

He expected a sheepish reply, but I sure as shit didn’t give him one, instead providing a thumbs up with my right hand and a middle finger with my left. I didn’t scare easy. Not only that, but I’ve been in the escort business long enough to know the difference between an actual predator and a small man making empty threats.

When I turned to walk up the cobblestone path that led to the funeral home, my ears became filled with the sound of Hank slamming his foot down on the accelerator, tires screeching against asphalt. Didn’t even bother to turn back around, honestly. No point.

*“Asshole.”* I murmured, securing my purse under my arm to prevent it from blowing away as I approached the opulent, repurposed plantation house.

The mansion’s white pillars loomed over me as I carefully climbed the porch steps, stilettos clacking against the refurbished wood. As I stepped toward the front door, a surge of anxiety unexpectedly sprinted up the length of my spine and planted itself at the top of my neck, crackling around the base of my skull like electricity from an exposed wire. With my heartbeat galloping in my chest, I took a deep breath and twisted the knob, not willing to let nervous energy prevent me from earning my keep.

A lot of what happened to me was out of my control, but I did one thing wrong that day. My gut was screaming for me to turn around. It implored me to sprint back down those stairs and into the street like the devil themself was close behind me, nipping at my heels.

But I ignored the feeling, contorted my face into an expression of grief, and pushed on, unknowingly putting myself into the Cult of the Scarab's crosshairs, intruding on their rite of sacred renewal.

\----------

*“Right this way, ma’am,”* said the funeral director, leading me into a familiar narrow hallway behind the lobby. Only a week earlier I’d been at this funeral home, pretending to grieve over someone else. As we walked, I reviewed the details I’d received concerning the deceased, provided to my agency by his company’s board of investors.

*Pharmaceutical CFO. Passed in his late sixties. Very private. Had two previous marriages. Right hand was mangled during his tenure in Vietnam, doesn’t bother with a prosthetic. Months before his death, rumors of him being gay cropped up in the tabloids.*

*I’m playing his secret lover. An unknown buxom paramour, weeping over the loss of their sugar daddy, dispelling the whispers of his potential homosexuality.*

People purchased my time for an assortment of different reasons. Sometimes, I was hired by the soon-to-be deceased, arriving at their memorial service just to boost the overall number of attendees visibly present and grieving. Other times, the request was more specific and it wasn’t the deceased who was hiring me.

This was one of those *other times.*

It wasn’t glamorous work, lying at some poor sap’s funeral on the behalf of someone else and their interests, but it was much preferable to the labor I performed when I was first hired. Think fishnet stockings and disagreements over the virtues of condom use.

All that said, it'd be disingenuous to say I wasn't proud of myself.

This was my niche, and despite the seediness, it was mine, and I was good at it. Considered an expert, actually. Anyone can show up and be a pretty face in the crowd; a twenty-something with running mascara and a nice ass cartoonishly *boo-hooing* into an open casket. But me? I played the assigned role with tact and nuance. I sold a narrative, and nine times out of ten, my marks bought it.

The key was you needed to be a proficient improviser.

Discretion was the name of the game in my line of work; I rarely got a lot of background information about the deceased to work with. Meant I had to be capable of thinking on my toes - bobbing and weaving through conversations like my life depended on it.

Ironically, though, if I wasn’t so damn convincing, I might not have ended up almost suffocating to death less than an hour after the funeral concluded.

\----------

I expected all the usual sounds of organized memorial would become audible as we approached the reception hall; sobbing, a pipe organ singing its quiet lamentations, hushed arguments over the division of an inheritance. Sounds most people associated with deep sorrow. To me, however, mourning sounded like work. It was ambient noise I had become so accustomed to that I barely even noticed it.

But that’s not what I heard as we drew closer to the service. Quite the opposite, actually. Joyful sounds reverberated down the hallway. As the funeral director opened the door to the reception hall, I heard laughing and the clinking of glasses. The sparkling timbre of a wedding filled my ears, not the joyless dirge of a wake.

I stepped in, and for a moment, I truly believed I was walking in on some kind of themed birthday party. Every attendee sported a pure white outfit, head to toe. The previously jubilant noise fizzled out into dead silence when they saw me enter, adorned in funerary black. I was nearly about to excuse myself back through the door when I spied a young man at the opposite end of the vast room, dressed in a black three-piece suit, leaning wearily against an enormous marble coffin.

*“Is…is this Jom’s funeral?”* I managed to sputter out into the motionless crowd.

The fifty or so funeral goers remained silent. I could tell that something about my arrival was intensely befuddling, with looks of confusion painted over the attendee’s faces. Eventually, the shrill squeaking of poorly lubricated metal wheels broke the silence. The crowd parted to reveal an elderly woman in a wheelchair pushing herself towards me. She peered from side-to-side as she approached, observing the still petrified mourners staring at me with a look of disapproval.

*“Oh, would you relax? Go back to what you were doing. I’ll figure it out. Khepri save us, y’all would be startled shitless by a ladybug if it flew at you too fast,”* she croaked. Slowly, the figures in white pulled their attention away from me, and the lively chatter resumed, albeit at a much lower volume.

With the funeral reanimated, the elderly woman brought her eyes to mine, converting her scowl into a toothy grin. A wispy white dress hung loosely from her skeletal frame, giving her the appearance of a mobility-challenged banshee. The weight of a golden broach pulled the front of her dress forward at the collarbone, revealing the outlines of her upper ribs through thin, liver spotted skin. The accessory was about the size of a golf ball, and it depicted a beetle with what looked like a lotus flower etched onto its wings.

*“And you are, dear?”* she asked, settling in front of me by using a levered brake to halt the wheelchair’s momentum.

Based on the woman’s command of the other mourners and her wizened appearance, I made an educated guess as to her identity.

*“Hi…you must be Jom’s mother?”*

She nodded, her brow furrowing and her grin melting away as her head tilted up and down. The matriarch studied me intensely, her expression now twisted into one of confusion, like those of the mourners when they first saw me.

Relief fluttered through my chest. I briefly savored the pleasurable rush that came after the anxiety of a calculated risk. Then I smiled, took a generous inhale, and continued, launching into an ad libbed speech I had given countless times before.

*""It is nice finally to meet you. I…I wish it wasn’t under these circumstances, and I wish I knew your first name, but you know how private Jom can be-”*

I paused and forced a chuckle, letting tears well up as I broke eye contact - body language that screamed “*I’m struggling to use past tense now that he's dead, oh the sweet misery”*. A sigh fell from my lips, and then I picked up where I left off.

*“…you know how private Jom* ***could*** *be. I’m Tara. Your son and I were together for the last year or so. What’s your first name, ma’am?”*

Unexpectedly, I watched her eyes widen with some mix of alarm and disbelief.

*“It’s…it’s Akila”*

Without saying anything more, she abruptly pivoted her head and torso around, scanning the room for someone. Akila seemingly couldn’t locate them in the crowd, so she just started shouting a name.

*“Horus! Hoooorus! Could someone bring my grandson over?”*

The figures closest to us leaped into action, clearly fighting to be the person that fulfilled Akila’s request. Within seconds, one of the attendees, a hulking middle-aged man with biceps like tree trunks, returned with the kid in the black suit that had been previously leaning against the coffin, practically dragging the miserable looking young man by the wrist to his grandmother.

*“Ah! There you are, Horus.”* Akila cooed.

The boy barely responded, giving his elder an affirmative grunt. Before he was pulled from the crowd, I was laser focused on selling my story, constructing answers to questions that hadn’t even been asked yet. Seeing the anguish dripping off his features broke my concentration.

He looked to be in his early twenties, about six-feet tall, with a shaved head and a half crescent nose ring connecting his nostrils. His eyes were saturated with a deep, reflective sadness, his gaze empty and distant, like he was watching a memory rather than actually seeing anything physically in front of him. The corners of his mouth were collapsed into a rigid, immovable frown, the type of vacant expression that’s left over only after you’ve already completely exhausted every other painful emotion.

My heart broke for him. Whatever familial weirdness was currently on display, with the perfect white dress code and the inappropriately cheery atmosphere, the kid seemed like he was the only one experiencing genuine grief. His dad was dead, and he looked hurt and alone.

That empathy would last about another ten minutes.

*“Horus…this woman, Tara, is claiming to have been with your father, and she’s showing up here dressed like…dressed like that. Did you know anything about this?”*

*This might be game over,* I thought to myself. *Need to come up with a way to recover.*

He pointed his empty gaze at me. For a second, his eyes remained cold. But then, like the flash of blinding white light before the explosion of an atomic bomb, his expression instantly brightened and became animated. It wasn’t recognition that had reignited Horus; it was something else.

It was an idea. I didn’t know it at the time, but Horus was a pretty damn good improvisor as well.

*“Yeah, I know her. Dad mentioned her a few times in passing. Told me that she may or may not show up today. He wasn’t sure whether she really loved him or not, but I think he told her to show up if she did really love him.”*

He paused, calculating what to say next.

*“Tara’s an outsider. Dad wasn’t sure that we’d accept her, especially after what happened with Diane.”*

Akila turned back to me, now stone-faced and deathly serious.

*“Well, Tara, is all that true? You’re here because you loved my son?”*

I didn’t have long to contemplate the strangeness that was unfolding in front me, so I acted on instinct.

Terrible call.

*“…yes! Yes, I loved Jom. That’s why I’m here.”*

Horus nearly crumbled to the ground, his immovable frown ascending into a grin swollen with ecstasy.

*“Well…well alright then. That’s very noble of you, to come here of your own volition, espousing your love from my son. Bassel, could you escort Tara to the front? Show her where family sits? The eulogy will be starting in a few minutes.”* Akila replied.

The brawny gentleman with the tree-trunk biceps walked over, placing one massive arm forward to guide me and the other massive arm on my shoulder, as if to make sure I wasn’t going anywhere.

Behind me, I heard Horus cackling, doubling over and practically wheezing from whatever he found to be so goddamned funny.

\----------

There was a certain comedy to the way Akila had been positioned to deliver the eulogy. I couldn’t appreciate the humor of it at the time, with Bassel following me like a shadow, his looming presence causing a veritable chorus of alarm bells to ring loudly in my skull. But, in retrospect, I remember the juxtaposition of her in front of the casket being genuinely funny.

She was just so absurdly small, and the coffin was just so absurdly big. A marble torpedo behind a human earthworm, wrinkled skin flapping up and down as she spewed her ritualistic bullshit into the microphone.

*“Jom was a wonderful son, a loving father, and a devoted vicar of Khepri.”* Akila boomed, voice tinged with bursts of static from cheap speaker systems.

*“When Jom was on death’s door, we all felt his pain. In terms of renewal, he was without an ideal conduit. We all still grieve the loss of Diane, consumed by heresy, leaving him without love and Horus without a mother.”*

I turned to Bassel, pointing to my bladder and then pointing to the door. It was a lie; nature wasn’t calling. Not in that sense, at least. My subconscious was screaming, begging me to get the fuck out of that room through whatever means possible.

*Something is so fucking wrong,* I thought, waiting for Bassel to respond to my pantomiming.

He smiled, but it wasn’t reassuring. The grin was patronizing, revealing his own bitter amusement rather than his willingness to help, like he was watching his cat trying and failing to jump onto a forbidden table.

The man shook his head *no* a few times, and then placed a hand over my scalp, manually twisting my head back in the direction of Akila.

*“Little did we know, however, that in the nick of time, Jom found love. He was scared to divulge his love to us, because she is an outsider, just as Diane was. But, by being here, she has proven herself worthy of Khepri’s embrace, unlike the heretic.”* she said, gesturing a bony hand in my direction, long acrylic nails taking the shape of hawk talons.

*“Tara - we’re very grateful for your love, and your commitment to Jom. As you well know, passionate love is the best conduit. It's easier for Khepri to mold. But, of course, the love of youngest son will do if passionate love isn’t available. All that is to say, I’m sure Horus is very grateful, as well.”*

At that point, my heart was crashing against my rib cage like jackhammer, percussive and relentless. Bassel’s sturdy hand remained on my head, fixing my gaze on Akila.

Because of that, I couldn’t look away when the matriarch turned to face me, detailing what was to be my fate.

*“Your black night, desolate and bare, will draw the death from Jom, granting him renewal.”*

Sweat poured over my body, drenching me with sticky fear.

*“Are you ready, Tara?”*

Another white-clad figure appeared behind Akila, wrenching the heavy lid of the casket open.

Inside, Jom’s desiccated corpse laid flat, arms crossed over his shoulders, naked as the day he was born. But his body only covered half of the available space.

You see, the reason the coffin was so damn large is because it was built to house two separate people. The other half *had* been for Jom’s son, but now it was designated for me.

They were going to bury me alive in that marble tomb. 

As if I even needed it confirmed at that point, I noted that the body had both of their hands. My actual assignment had lost one of his during their tour of Vietnam.

Hank had dropped me off on the wrong day.

When I didn’t move towards the casket, paralyzed by fear, Akila spoke into the microphone one more time, sharp static crackling through the speakers again like an electric tongue whipping invisibly through the air.

*“Bassel, it seems like Tara is having a bit of cold feet. Bring her over here, show our conduit how spacious it is inside, next to her beloved.”*

The man’s muscular paw pulled my head up, forcing me to my feet.

I tried to brainstorm even a fragment of an exit strategy, but for the second time that day, Horus broke my concentration.

Somewhere in the back of the room, I heard him snickering under his breath, downright elated with his unbelievably good fortune.

I wouldn’t let him distract me again [after that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/s/d1QcQtqEBf)",2,1757310150.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I told her I can talk to my boss about cooking it some more and she said okay well I’ll wait and eat some bread until they bring my steak back. So I’m like in my head okay… ya know and so then the steak comes back the chef didn’t give her a brand new steak just the same steak she sliced into which may have caused her to be annoyed I wasn’t aware she was annoyed because when I brought her steak to her she didn’t complain she said” perfect” and started eating it. Then towards the end of the dinner I was clearing for the event and they were going to get dessert. She came back and sat down w her desert and asked for coffee. Before we start the wedding we are all told what to do. Coffee services were not mentioned. So I told her coffee isn’t required unless the bride and groom paid for those services. So she looks at me in shock and gets up immediately and looks for my boss. She gets to him and starts crying saying I didn’t give her coffee when she asked and let him know that I said it wasn’t required. She then went on to call not just me but all the servers dickheads and wasn’t even cry in ended up wiping her fake tears and walked past me and whispered dickheads in my ear. I said “okay girl” as she walked away. Butttt I ended up going to my boss and asked him was coffee supposed to be given he says yes. Why weren’t we made aware of that then? Then he goes on to tell me how I was wrong to not offer coffee. I’m okay with that but the fact that he didn’t even try to tell the lady her words were inappropriate and uncalled for pissed me off. How dare you let this woman disrespect the people working under you and not stop her in her tracks all for the business or money???? Mind you I am a black 25 year old woman this lady is white and crying tears like a Karen. I would have given her the coffee had she not stormed off and fake cried along with calling me out my name if she just asked my boss and got her answer then I would have gotten her coffee if she asked again or even if she didn’t ask all she had to do was not call me out my name and go to my boss fake crying. I’ve never experienced a Karen before until today. Never experienced something so racist until today. I was really taken aback and couldn’t continue my service with this individual. I had to step aside and let a coworker bring her coffee… because this Dickhead… was not doing it since I’m a dickhead. Some may call it childish but there are my boundaries I won’t let someone disrespect me and still continue to serve them. I am not going out my way for a racist woman who was intentionally trying to get me in trouble when I was accommodating her and her whole family all day. I don’t think any of my coworkers or myself deserved that but hey… my “boss” disappeared after the fact and didn’t try and check on me after but if it were anyone else he’d be concerned. ….. was I wrong for not apologizing after realizing she could get coffee? Should I have brought her coffee? Would you get someone coffee after they call you a dickhead. One of my bosses had a lot to say about me not holding myself accountable when really. They leave whenever someone disrespects them too. So I’m not understanding why i have to be so perfect at a job that doesn’t care for me. ,0,1757310118.0,Serverlife,10,0.38,False
1nbfkcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildofHoarder/comments/1nbfkcg/need_advice_mum_wants_to_bring_everything_from/,Need advice: Mum wants to bring everything from her storage unit back to the house,"My mum (61) wants my partner (35) and I (35) to move our stuff (that we actually use) to make room for boxes that she hasn’t opened for 30 years and doesn’t even know the contents of. I need advice about how to handle this and you guys are probably the only people who’ll understand.

When mum bought this house, the idea was that she’d renovate the (above ground) basement so we’d have separate living spaces. But that didn’t happen basically because of cost & I spent 3 years battling a serious illness. 

My partner and I got rid of most of our stuff from our houses, what we have left is in the basement.

“Why does a 35 year old couple live with your mum?” I hear you asking. We’re in Australia where we now have one of the worst housing crises in the developed world.  

Dual-living was meant to give everyone housing stability and help mum as she ages. But for me, a big reason was being horrified at the state she was living in. Back then, I had no idea that it was hoarding disorder. She has improved a fair bit in the last 5 years. 

So Mum has moved these boxes between 5 different houses in the last 30 years. Now she wants to get rid of the storage unit to save money. 

First she wanted us to move all our stuff out of the basement. Now she’s comprised and said we can leave some things there. She’s decided which of our stuff can stay and which must go. 
She also wants us to help her move her boxes here (the storage unit is 1.5hr drive away). 

The detached garage is 2/3 her hoard (in boxes) that was badly infested with mice. There’s even a python living in there now!! My partner helped her willingly get rid of 1/3 of it.

She made him a deal that if he helped her “sort” through her things, he could have the shed to start building his business again (he had to leave his business in Ukraine…). It was perfect - it gave mum a reason outside her own ”flaws” to get rid of things. He’s an incredibly patient and sweet man to support her emotionally through that. Plus he’s lived in a war zone, so her hoard doesn’t scare him 😅😅

But his patience is wearing thin, she’s making more excuses to not “sort boxes”, he’s starting to understand how much her hoarding has affected me over the years. She expects a lot from us (has always parentified me, craves enmeshment etc) and he feels she’s taking advantage of our kindness and that she hasn’t kept her promises. 

His words: “First she’s like get out from the place that I gave you, I need to put there my boxes. Second. Go bring my boxes and put them on your place. Third- unpack the boxes for me, wash all my things and bring me coffee?”

If her boxes go in the basement, we won’t be able to renovate until she “sorts” them -which will never happen. She insists on putting herself through the emotional turmoil of painstakingly sorting through this stuff. 

That means we will have to do the more expensive option of a granny flat. We can’t get finance until my partner has permanent residency which is likely 3 years away. 

We’re also worried about the extra clutter making it harder to prevent mice and mould. 

Mum wants to move the stuff this week. My partner is refusing to help as an act of protest. So now she’s angry with him. I feel stuck and hopeless. 

I keep thinking of writing her a heartfelt letter but I know it’s unrealistic that’ll change her mind. She doesn’t listen, she will just get angry if I say anything against her plan.

Moving out isn’t an option. I have livestock, but even if I sold them it’s impossible to rent here (even though we have good jobs). I cannot emphasise how bad the housing crisis is here and we’re in a rural/remote area where it’s even worse.

We’re trying to save enough money to build our own space to have kids. I grew up in a hoarding house, I don’t want raise a child in that environment too. We’re 35, we don’t have much time left. 

I feel hopeless. I don’t know what to do. I’m so numb to her hoarding and bad behaviour that I don’t even know what to think about my partner and my mum being angry at each other. I would really appreciate any advice.

My coworker who was in the car with me thinks I should have passed it on because it is the ""right thing to do"" however I feel like paying for someone else's order especially if it was $15+ more than I was going to spend is outrageous.

There are lots of common recommendations for natural substances like spices that are said to deter them, but not much info about how well or for how long.  This is day 1 of an attempt to somewhat systematically figure out for myself which ones work the best.

**Results so far**

Orange extract and peppermint extract both seem to work reliably.  Coffee grounds sort of work but the ants are pretty good at finding any areas where the grounds haven't been spread evenly and getting through.  Lemon extract does not work and may attract more.

**Procedure**

I mixed about 120g of powdered cane sugar in 400-500ml water, roughly in line with what's usually recommended for DIY ant bait solutions.  I folded up 6 tissues and dunked them in the sugar solution as an attractant, and staked them in the ground with nails about 2 feet apart.  One of those was a control.  Around the others, I put down a ~10cm radius circle of either a capful of extract, or maybe around 4 tbsp of spent coffee grounds.  

After a few hours, I went back outside to check.  The control and lemon extract tissues both had many ants, and the coffee one had a few.  None on the other two.

**Future experiments**

I may try something similar with cinnamon and cayenne pepper as new tests since people have also mentioned those as possibilities.  

I'm more likely to have those around at any given time than extracts, but I also wonder about how much any of these will stick around in the face of rain.  I'll be leaving the existing ones out for a day or two and see if there are any notable changes.  Ideally some rain coming in might allow for a natural test of how much water washes them away, although I guess I could try a hose sprayer too.  The hope would be to come up with something cheap, easily available and that doesn't require constantly reapplying.  Maybe citronella would be another interesting experiment for that.

Other ideas?

1nbfh6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/WellnessVortex/comments/1nbfh6y/the_night_i_realized_willpower_was_a_lie/,The Night I Realized Willpower Was a Lie,"It was 11:47 PM on a Tuesday. I know because I was staring at the microwave clock while heating up leftover pizza — the same pizza I’d sworn off that morning when I looked in the bathroom mirror and made another one of those promises.

You know the ones. “This is it. No more junk food. I’m going to eat clean, exercise daily, and finally get my act together.”

I’d thrown away the chips. Meal-prepped like a champion. Even downloaded a new fitness app. I was *ready*.

And there I was, less than 16 hours later, waiting for processed cheese to bubble while my stomach growled and my resolve lay in tatters on the kitchen floor.

That’s when it hit me: What if the problem isn’t that I’m weak? What if willpower itself is the scam?

**The Story We’ve Been Sold**

We’ve been handed this narrative that successful people are just better at saying no. They have more discipline. More self-control. More… willpower.

It’s everywhere. Instagram fitness influencers preaching about “mind over matter.” Diet books promising transformation through pure determination. Your well-meaning friend who says, “You just need to want it more.”

But here’s what nobody talks about: If willpower worked the way we think it does, why do 95% of diets fail? Why are gyms packed in January and ghost towns by March? Why do even the most driven, successful people struggle with the same handful of habits year after year?

The answer isn’t comfortable, but it’s liberating: You haven’t been failing willpower. Willpower has been failing *you*.

# What’s Really Happening in Your Brain

Let me paint you a picture of what actually went down that Tuesday night.

I’d skipped lunch because of back-to-back meetings. By 3 PM, my blood sugar was in free fall, but I powered through with coffee and determination. Dinner was late because of traffic, and it was smaller than usual because I was “being good.”

By 11 PM, my brain was sending out distress signals like a ship taking on water. Cortisol spiked. Ghrelin (the hunger hormone) went haywire. My prefrontal cortex — the part responsible for decision-making — was running on fumes.

Meanwhile, my primitive brain was screaming: “FIND CALORIES. NOW. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.”

Guess which brain won?

This isn’t a character flaw. This is biology. Your body doesn’t care about your fitness goals. It cares about keeping you alive. And when it perceives restriction or stress, it overrides your good intentions faster than you can say “cheat meal.”

**The Willpower Battery Myth**

Here’s how we’ve been taught to think about willpower: It’s like a muscle. Use it more, and it gets stronger.

But that’s not how it works. Willpower is more like your phone battery. It starts full in the morning, then gets drained by every single decision you make:

* What to wear (2% gone)
* Whether to check that text (1% gone)
* Resisting the office donuts (5% gone)
* Being polite to your annoying coworker (3% gone)

By evening, you’re running on willpower fumes. And that’s when the real challenges hit — dinner decisions, Netflix vs. exercise, that pint of ice cream calling your name.

You’re not weak. You’re human. And you’re trying to win a game with a dead battery.

**The System Designed to Break You**

Want to know something that’ll make you angry? The failure is built into the system.

Walk into any grocery store. Where do they put the candy? Right at eye level by the checkout, where you’re tired, hungry, and your willpower is already spent from navigating a thousand food choices.

Open your phone. How many apps are specifically designed to hijack your attention and override your better judgment? (Hint: Almost all of them.)

Even gyms profit from your predictable “failure.” They sell thousands of January memberships, knowing most people will quit by Valentine’s Day. Their business model literally depends on your willpower burning out.

You’re not playing on a level field. You’re playing against neuroscientists, behavioral economists, and billion-dollar industries that have spent decades figuring out exactly how to bypass your conscious decision-making.

**The Real Enemy**

So if it’s not willpower, what’s actually sabotaging you?

It’s the gap. The gap between what you consciously want and what your biology is programmed to do.

You consciously want to eat healthier. Your biology wants calorie-dense foods for survival.

You consciously want to exercise. Your biology wants to conserve energy.

You consciously want to go to bed early. Your biology is wired to stay alert for potential threats (even if those “threats” are Netflix notifications).

The bigger this gap, the more exhausting life becomes. You spend all day fighting your own wiring, then blame yourself when you lose.

**A Different Way Forward**

Here’s what changed everything for me: I stopped trying to overpower my biology and started working *with* it.

Instead of white-knuckling through hunger, I learned to stabilize my blood sugar. Instead of forcing myself to love cardio, I found movement that felt good. Instead of setting impossible standards, I designed systems that made good choices automatic.

The result? I stopped feeling like I was at war with myself. Food became fuel instead of the enemy. Exercise became something I looked forward to. Sleep improved because I wasn’t constantly stressed about my lack of willpower.

Most importantly, I stopped carrying around that heavy backpack of shame — the constant story that I was somehow broken or weak.

**Your Biology Isn’t the Enemy**

Your body isn’t sabotaging you. It’s trying to protect you. Those late-night cravings? Your brain ensures you have enough energy for tomorrow. That resistance to exercise? Your nervous system is conserving resources for potential emergencies.

Once you understand this, everything shifts. You stop fighting your biology and start designing around it.

You stop asking, “Why can’t I just have more willpower?” and start asking, “How can I make this easier?”

That’s where the real transformation happens.

**A question for you:** Think about the last time you “broke” and did something you’d sworn off. What was happening in the hours before? Were you tired? Stressed? Hungry? Had you been “good” for too long?

I bet if you trace it back, you’ll find your biology was ""just"" doing its job. And maybe, just maybe, you’ll stop blaming yourself and start getting curious about a better way forward.

Like, for example, I visited the career fair this past week and had no idea what to say or how to act(every sentence felt like an airball lmao). And it also turns out I suck at interviews, when I didn't even get a callback for my social club.

I wonder if ygs(and especially Penn!) have any resources on how to approach these things(what to say in coffee chats, to recruiters, and in interviews). How to leverage the Penn alumni network and career opportunities that Penn hosts?

When I did my tour a year ago, I remember my tour guide saying that quite a few companies have jobs/internships open specifically for Penn students but no ones has mentioned anything here. 

TLDR, my parents are paying a ton of money to go here, and I'm worried I'm missing something important and I'm gonna be jobless.

Sending you lots of love and courage... and maybe even a pinch of envy 😉 Go make those memories that fuel our storis for a lifetime.

It totally caught me off guard, and I felt this sudden wave of warmth and hapoiness wash over me. I swear, it made my day a little brighetr, and I think I had an exrta hop in my step for the rest of the morning.

What's interesting is that small gestures like this can have such a big impact on our mood, even if they seem kinda trivial at the time. I read somewhere that it's all about feeling acknowledged and appreciated, even by strajgers. When someone gives us a compliment, especially when it's unexpected, it triggers a release of dopamine, the so-called 'feel-good' hoormone. It's wild how something as simple as a kind word can mean so much. So to anyone out there thinking their smal acts of kindness don't matter, trust me, they do! 😊",9,1757309239.0,WhyWeAct,1,1.0,False

1nbfa9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingAround/comments/1nbfa9p/loyalty_points_in_india_worth_it_or_just_a/,🎯 Loyalty Points in India: Worth It or Just a Marketing Gimmick? 🤔,"From **CRED Coins** to **Flipkart SuperCoins**, every brand wants us to feel rewarded.

* These programs **encourage extra spending** with psychological tricks like expiring points.
* Example: Spending ₹500 just to use a ₹50 coupon = **not saving money**.

**Golden Rule:** *If you wouldn’t buy it without the loyalty points, don’t buy it because of them.*

1. **Track Expiry Dates** – Set reminders to avoid wasted points.
2. **Stack With Coupons** – Combine loyalty programs with active coupons from [SavingAround](https://savingaround.com/coupons).
3. **Calculate Real Value** – If rewards are less than 1–2% of spending, it’s probably a gimmick.

Let's date and get to know each other.,"Let's see if we will work out. To set expectations, I'm willing to travel to your location as long as it's not far away than Manila or Quezon City Areas. If you're from Tarlac or Pangasinan, all the better.

**For both of our safety**: Let's exchange pictures of ourselves in DMs (we can also do it on TG or WhatsApp, if you want). Just to be sure we can trust each other. If we end up both being attracted to each other by seeing our pictures, then let's go for it! Don't worry, I will NOT be asking you for nude photos or videos and please don't ask me for those as well. I personally think ""Spark"" is important in any relationships and it's better if we're both attracted to each other physically FIRST before anything else, then we can go from there. This is to filter out scammers and frauds out there. I'm NOT the type of guy who will ghost you or get rid of you out of nowhere. Instead, I'll be HONEST with you up-front (more details below and I don't know why so many can't just spit it out instead of wasting another person's time) and that's the reason why spark and expectations in the beginning is IMPORTANT. Safety first!

1nbf94q,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1nbf94q/devils_fury_a_maid_rushed_into_the_room/,Devil's Fury | A maid rushed into the room," accept your terms."" My voice remained steady as I spoke into the phone. ""I'll return as the heiress.""  
  
The line went dead.  
  
I stared at the bedroom that had been my prison for eight long years. A bitter smile touched my lips. Eight years of devotion. Eight years of patience. Eight years of love. All for nothing.  
  
""How dare you wear my mother's dress!""  
  
The shrill voice shattered my thoughts. I turned slowly to face Liam, his small face contorted with rage.  
  
""You're not going to say anything?"" he demanded, tiny hands clenched into fists.  
  
""Your friends are waiting, Liam."" I kept my voice soft. ""You should go enjoy your party.""  
  
""No!"" he screamed.  
  
He grabbed the ceramic pitcher from the table and threw its contents at me. Scalding hot coffee drenched my dress and skin. I cried out in pain.  
  
""Serves you right! You'll never replace my mother! You killed her with your evil heart!"" Liam shouted. ""And now you're wearing her favorite dress!""  
  
A maid rushed into the room. She gasped at the sight of me covered in coffee stains, my skin already reddening from burns.  
  
""I'm so sorry, Miss! Liam escaped from his minders."" The maid grabbed the smirking boy and hurried away.  
  
I retreated to the bathroom. The dress had never belonged to Isabella, my stepsister who died giving birth to Liam. It was mine—a gift from my late mother that Isabella had stolen from me. Just like she stole everything else.  
  
Eight years ago, I was supposed to marry Alexander Russo. We were childhood sweethearts. I believed we were in love. Then he married Isabella. She became pregnant. She lived the life that should have been mine.  
  
Then she died. Everyone called me bad luck. They accused me of killing her out of jealousy.  
  
As Isabella's only sister and Alexander's former fiancée, I was sent to care for Liam. My stepmother told me to treat him like my own son.  
  
For eight years, I did exactly that. I loved Liam as my own. I cared for Alexander too. But I was foolish. Alexander never loved me.  
  
They both treated me like garbage. They made sure I knew my place—nothing but a live-in nanny. A servant.  
  
Liam never respected me. He constantly found ways to hurt me. But today, on his eighth birthday, I decided enough was enough.  
  
If this had happened three years ago, I would have begged for his forgiveness. Not anymore.  
  
""The party has started."" Alexander's voice came from the doorway. ""Where are you, Rachel?""  
  
I emerged from the bathroom just as he entered. He sighed at the sight of my stained dress.  
  
""I heard what Liam did. Don't take it personally. He's just a child who loves you,"" Alexander said.  
  
I laughed bitterly. ""That boy doesn't know the first thing about loving me.""  
  
""Don't say that. He's a good kid."" Alexander frowned.  
  
I moved away from him and reached for the healing balm on the nightstand. My skin burned where the coffee had scalded it. The ointment would work miracles overnight.  
  
""Let me help you."" Alexander took the balm from my hands before I could protest.  
  
His fingers gently massaged the ointment into my burned skin. Years ago, his touch would have made me weak. Now it made my skin crawl.  
  
""Be patient with him,"" he whispered, his breath warm against my neck.  
  
I pulled away. ""I need to tell you something.""  
  
""Can't it wait? Liam's birthday celebration has begun.""  
  
""No, it can't wait."" I met his gaze directly. ""Eight years is enough. I'm leaving.""Chapter 2  
  
""What are you talking about?"" Alexander's voice boomed.  
  
I saw his expression darken with rage.  
  
The air grew thick with tension.  
  
But I refused to back down.  
  
""It's been eight years, Alexander. I want out,"" I stated clearly.  
  
He glared at me. ""What's wrong with you? Why cause trouble now? I told you Liam is just a kid. Don't take his actions personally. It's his birthday today. Come with me. I'll deal with him later.""  
  
Alexander reached for my hand, pulling me toward the door.  
  
I snatched my hand back. ""You promised I could leave when he turned eight. So why am I the one causing trouble?"" I challenged.  
  
Before he could respond, an angry voice cut through the air.  
  
""Rachel, you have no shame! Always making everything about you, even on my grandson's special day!""  
  
I recognized that voice instantly.  
  
Victoria. My stepmother. Liam's grandmother.  
  
She was the one who made the deal with Alexander. Eight years, then freedom.  
  
So why were they acting like this now?  
  
""I'm not making it about me, Victoria. You said I could leave after eight years,"" I reminded her.  
  
She laughed mockingly. ""Did you have to bring this up today?""  
  
""It's fine. I'm sure Rachel didn't mean any harm,"" Alexander interrupted.  
  
In the past, his defense would have made me blush.  
  
Now I knew better. It was just another pathetic attempt to keep me trapped.  
  
""Come on, let's join the party,"" Alexander said to me.  
  
I stayed silent, letting him lead me to the ongoing celebration.  
  
Liam and his friends were playing happily.  
  
His smile vanished when he saw me.  
  
""Look, Liam, your mom's here,"" someone said.  
  
He scoffed loudly. ""She's not my mother!""  
  
I stood nearby while Alexander sighed and pulled Liam close.  
  
""We don't say things like that. Rachel is your mother. She's taken good care of you,"" Alexander stated firmly.  
  
Liam's face twisted with anger. ""No! She can never be my mother. Everyone, this woman killed my real mom!""  
  
Whispers spread through the party hall.  
  
All eyes turned to me.  
  
""She's the boy's aunt.""  
  
""Why doesn't the boy like her?""  
  
""Clearly she's not treating him well.""  
  
""Apologize to her right now,"" Alexander demanded.  
  
I stopped him. ""It's fine. It doesn't matter.""  
  
I walked away calmly.  
  
In the past, Liam's words would have shattered me.  
  
But I've accepted the truth.  
  
No matter what I do, Alexander's heart will always belong to Isabella.  
  
Liam will always blame me for taking his mother's place.  
  
""Why did you have to make a scene today?""  
  
Victoria's sharp voice cut through my thoughts.  
  
She stepped into view, glaring.  
  
""What do you want, Victoria? I've played my part for eight years. I'm done,"" I said.  
  
""You should care for Liam like your own son. Tolerate his behavior. Look after him. If my daughter were alive, he'd be treated much better,"" she snapped.  
  
I shrugged, exhausted. ""Too bad your daughter isn't here.""  
  
Victoria raised her hand to strike me.  
  
I caught her wrist. ""Don't try it. I'm not in the mood. Eight years ago you forced me to come here and take care of them. The contract is over. Liam is eight. I have every right to leave.""  
  
She yanked her hand back, rubbing her sore wrist.  
  
She glared at me. ""Do what you want, Rachel. This is why no one will ever love you. Even your father can't stand you!"" she hissed before storming off.  
  
A bitter smile touched my lips.  
  
Eight years since I last saw my father.  
  
Since his favorite daughter died and he sent me away.  
  
He never cared to visit.  
  
""I'm sorry. I got you a gift.""  
  
A small voice spoke behind me.  
  
I turned to see Liam standing there with an innocent smile.  
  
He held a wrapped gift box.  
  
I smiled. ""Aww, you shouldn't have.""  
  
He giggled. ""I wanted to. Please, open it.""  
  
I took the box and opened it.  
  
A foul smell hit my nose.  
  
Inside was the lifeless body of my cat, Oliver, killed with an arrow.  
  
""That will be you soon if you don't leave me and my father alone,"" Liam giggled.Chapter 3I stared in horror at the only pet I’d been permitted to bring to the estate.  
  
My hands trembled as I looked at the arrow piercing Oliver’s small body.  
  
I had raised Liam with the same tenderness.  
  
Yet this was how he repaid me.  
  
“Stay out of my way,” Liam snapped, his voice cold.  
  
“And don’t you dare upset my father because of this.”  
  
He stormed off without a backward glance.  
  
I remained frozen, my gaze locked on the lifeless form of my cat.  
  
The irony was cruel.  
  
I had taught Liam how to handle a bow.  
  
I had taught him so much.  
  
Now he turned every lesson against me.  
  
Cradling the small box, I let a tear escape.  
  
Oliver had been my silent companion through countless lonely nights.  
  
“Rachel, what are you doing out here in the cold?” Alexander’s voice cut through the evening air.  
  
He stepped out into the garden, concern etching his features.  
  
“You’ll catch a chill.”  
  
He moved behind me, draping his jacket over my shoulders.  
  
I shook it off immediately.  
  
His eyes fell to the box in my arms, and his expression tightened with distaste.  
  
“Your son came to apologize,” I said flatly.  
  
Alexander’s frown deepened.  
  
“He’s your son too, Rachel.”  
  
I let out a bitter laugh.  
  
“He despises me, Alexander.  
  
He killed my cat.”  
  
“Come inside,” he urged, his tone softening.  
  
“We’ll discuss this with Liam in the morning.  
  
You can bury the cat tomorrow.  
  
It was just a boy’s thoughtless prank.”  
  
I pulled away, clutching the box tighter.  
  
“I’m not leaving him outside for the animals.”  
  
Though he complained about my stubbornness, Alexander followed me into the garden.  
  
He stood silently as I dug a small grave under the old oak tree.  
  
When it was done, I brushed the dirt from my hands and turned toward the house.  
  
The party had ended.  
  
The guests were gone.  
  
The wind picked up, biting through my thin dress.  
  
I sneezed just as Alexander reached for me.  
  
He guided me inside and up to my room.  
  
He sat me on his lap, but I stiffened, pulling away.  
  
“What do you want, Alexander?” I demanded.  
  
He sighed.  
  
“I’ll get you another cat, Rachel.  
  
A dozen if you wish.”  
  
“I want to leave.  
  
Tomorrow.”  
  
Alexander’s body went rigid.  
  
“Liam is just a child.  
  
I trust no one else with him.  
  
Where would you even go?  
  
You have no one.”  
  
“I’ll manage,” I said, my voice hollow.  
  
“I don’t belong here.  
  
You refused to marry me after eight years, Alexander.”  
  
“You know why I can’t take another wife now,” he replied, frustration creeping into his tone.  
  
“I’m not asking you to.  
  
I don’t want to marry you.  
  
I just want to go.”  
  
“Then have my child,” he said suddenly, his eyes intent.  
  
“A child would secure your position.  
  
No one would dare disrespect you then.  
  
And Liam would have a sibling.”  
  
A sad smile touched my lips.  
  
I had sacrificed everything for this family—my pride, my youth, my self-respect.  
  
And still, he wanted me to bear an illegitimate child.  
  
All to keep me under his roof, all to control me.  
  
“I’ve already instructed the maid on Liam’s routine.  
  
He’s homeschooled—hire better tutors or send him to school.  
  
He doesn’t need me.”  
  
Alexander leaned in and kissed me.  
  
“Sleep on it.  
  
We’ll talk in the morning.”  
  
But I didn’t sleep.  
  
I packed my bags through the night, Oliver’s still face haunting me.  
  
Morning arrived too soon.  
  
After a quick shower, I dragged my suitcases downstairs.  
  
This was it.  
  
I was finally leaving.  
  
But peace was not in the cards for me.  
  
A slow, mocking clap echoed across the courtyard.  
  
Sophia leaned against a pillar, a smirk playing on her lips.  
  
“Well, well.  
  
Finally developed some self-respect, have you?”  
  
I ignored her, continuing toward the gate.  
  
She stepped into my path, blocking my exit.  
  
“Eight years, Rachel.  
  
Eight years you spent waiting for a man who never wanted you.  
  
And now you’re walking away?”  
  
She chuckled.  
  
“Took you long enough to understand.  
  
Alexander and Liam will never love you.  
  
You were always just the worthless mistress.”  
  
I met her gaze, my face expressionless.  
  
“Enjoy your victory then.  
  
Do as you please.  
  
None of this matters to me anymore.”  
  
Her smirk widened.  
  
“Oh, I will.  
  
Soon I’ll be moving in.  
  
I’ll take everything that was never yours.”  
  
Before I could reply, the front doors flew open.  
  
Alexander stepped out, Liam close behind.  
  
In an instant, Sophia’s demeanor shattered.  
  
She fell to her knees, clutching the hem of my dress with theatrical desperation.  
  
“Rachel, please don’t go!” she sobbed, her voice trembling.  
  
“Liam needs you!  
  
How can you abandon him after all these years?”  
  
I stared down at her, numb.  
  
“He loves you, he really does!” she cried, tears streaming down her face.  
  
“He’s just a boy!  
  
Please, I beg you—don’t leave him!”  
  
Alexander let out an impatient sigh.  
  
“Stop this nonsense, Sophia.  
  
You’re making a scene.”  
  
His eyes were cold as they settled on me.  
  
“I said I’d replace the cat.  
  
Don’t upset Sophia over something so trivial.”  
  
I clenched my fists, but before I could speak, Liam rushed to Sophia’s side.  
  
He helped her up, his small hands wiping her fake tears.  
  
Then he turned to me, his eyes burning with hatred.  
  
“You killed my mother with your wickedness,” he spat.  
  
“And now you’re trying to hurt Sophia too?”  
  
His voice shook with anger.  
  
He looked back at Sophia, his expression softening.  
  
“Don’t cry.  
  
Let her go.  
  
I don’t want her here.  
  
I don’t need her.”  
  
He lifted his chin, his words sharp as blades.  
  
“I want you to be my mother.  
  
You should marry my father.”  
  
Then his eyes returned to me, filled with pure scorn.  
  
“You have an evil heart.  
  
That’s why my father could never love you.”  
  
A cruel smile touched his lips.  
  
“I’m glad you’re leaving.”  
  
I swallowed the pain thickening in my throat.  
  
I took one last look at the boy I had raised, the child I had loved as my own.  
  
“After eight years,” I said quietly, “if this is what you believe of me, then there’s no reason left to stay.”  
  
Without another word, I turned and walked toward the gate.  
  
Just as I reached it, I heard the familiar sound of a crossbow being drawn.  
  
An arrow whizzed past, missing my head by inches.Chapter 4Isabella’s POV  
  
“Don’t think pretending to be pitiful will make me keep you as my stepmother!”  
  
“If you have the guts to leave, never come back!”  
  
The sharp arrow flew straight toward me, loaded with the boy’s bitter rage.  
  
I barely moved in time, but it still sliced deep into my shoulder.  
  
A raw cry tore from my throat.  
  
Alexander was at my side instantly, holding me as I clenched my teeth against the pain.  
  
“I’m so sorry, Isabella,” he cried out.  
  
Just then, Sophia screamed, and Liam shouted too.  
  
“Papa, come quick! Aunt Sophia twisted her ankle running to help that witch!” Liam yelled.  
  
Alexander looked torn, his eyes darting between my bleeding shoulder and Sophia’s dramatic fall.  
  
He released me with a heavy sigh.  
  
“It’s a clean wound, Isabella. Go to the hospital—I’ll meet you there. Sophia can’t walk; I have to take her,” he said.  
  
I didn’t let my disappointment show.  
  
I stayed on the ground, watching him walk away from me—again.  
  
He carried Sophia in his arms, bridal style.  
  
She shot me a smug look as they got into the car and drove off with Liam.  
  
There I was, left alone on the cold floor, bleeding from a wound given by the child I had raised, trained, and taught to shoot.  
  
Life could be so cruel.  
  
I struggled to stand when I heard footsteps behind me.  
  
“You wretched girl! Why are you still here? Didn’t you tell the whole city you were leaving?”  
  
I knew that voice. It was Eleanor, Alexander’s mother. She had always despised me.  
  
I forced myself up and turned to face her.  
  
She gasped when she saw my injury and the blood staining my clothes.  
  
“Trying to frame my son? If you want to die, do it somewhere else!” she spat.  
  
“I was leaving when your grandson shot me,” I replied coldly.  
  
She laughed mockingly. “Hurt yourself and now blaming a child? You’re just acting pitiful so Alexander pities you. You lost your place here the moment you decided to go.”  
  
“I want nothing from you or your family, Eleanor. Your grandson did this!” I snapped.  
  
She smirked. “Then you won’t mind getting out.”  
  
Before I could respond, she snatched my luggage and threw it outside the gate.  
  
“Get out!” she hissed, shoving me out too. “Go die somewhere else. Leave my son alone.”  
  
I stumbled and fell, clutching my bleeding shoulder.  
  
“You’ll regret this,” I vowed, fury burning in my chest.  
  
I gathered my boxes just as my Uber pulled up.  
  
“Sorry I’m late, Miss,” the driver said.  
  
“It’s fine,” I muttered, sliding into the back seat.  
  
He eyed my shoulder. “Still heading to the airport?”  
  
I shook my head. “Take me to the hospital first.”  
  
I leaned back and closed my eyes, exhaustion taking over.  
  
I woke to the steady beeping of an EKG machine.  
  
I was in a hospital room. My arm throbbed with pain when I tried to sit up.  
  
My boxes were stacked neatly beside the bed.  
  
The door opened, and a doctor walked in.  
  
“Miss Isabella, how are you feeling?” he asked.  
  
I groaned. “What happened? Last thing I remember, I was in a cab.”  
  
The doctor nodded. “You passed out before arriving. The Uber driver brought you in.”  
  
I checked my phone. I’d missed my flight.  
  
A new text waited. I replied quickly.  
  
Something came up. Reschedule my flight ASAP.  
  
“Miss Isabella?” The doctor pulled my attention back.  
  
I lifted a brow. “Yes?”  
  
“You lost a lot of blood, but you’ve been treated. You’ll be discharged soon,” he explained.  
  
I nodded. “Thank you.”  
  
He smiled and left. I stood and reached for my boxes.  
  
Not a single call or message from Alexander.  
  
His son shot me, and he couldn’t even check if I was alive.  
  
The door swung open.  
  
Sophia walked in, looking pleased with herself.  
  
I rolled my eyes.  
  
“What do you want? I thought you twisted your ankle,” I said flatly.  
  
She giggled. “Oh, that? I just wanted to see who Alexander would choose. And he picked me! Exciting, isn’t it?”  
  
I scoffed. “Have your fun, Sophia. I’m leaving.”  
  
She stepped in front of me, a smug smile on her lips.  
  
“There’s something you should know,” she said, voice dripping with pride. “I’m pregnant. With Alexander’s baby.”  
  
The air left my lungs.  
  
My heart shattered, but I refused to let it show.  
  
I wouldn’t give her the satisfaction.  
  
Eight years.  
  
Eight years by his side, and I was never more than a shadow.  
  
He always made me take birth control right after he was done with me.  
  
He always wanted another child.  
  
Just not with me.Chapter 5  
  
""Goodbye, Sophia,"" I told her.  
  
She stood firmly in my path, refusing to let me pass.  
  
My patience was wearing thin. My phone had just buzzed with a flight update—rescheduled, and I couldn't miss it this time.  
  
All I wanted was to get away from these people. Why was she purposely provoking me?  
  
""What do you want?"" I demanded.  
  
Sophia gave a sly smile. ""I want to see you break down.""  
  
I let out a harsh laugh. ""Not going to happen.""  
  
As I tried to move past her with my box, she threw a few dollar bills at my feet.  
  
""For your taxi fare,"" she sneered.  
  
Something in me snapped. Before I could stop myself, my hand flew out and struck her across the face.  
  
""How dare you?"" I seethed.  
  
Sophia screamed loudly, just as Alexander and Liam rushed into the room.  
  
""What did you do, Isabella?"" Alexander shouted, seeing Sophia’s reddened cheek.  
  
I glared back. ""What did I do? You come running when she screams. Where were you when your son shot me? Where were you when I was bleeding out?""  
  
""Evil woman!"" Liam cried out. ""She hurt Sophia!""  
  
""It's not her fault, Liam,"" Sophia whimpered. ""I came to ask her to stay. I offered her money, and she hit me.""  
  
""Stop the act, Sophia. Stop playing the victim!"" I snapped.  
  
""No, you stop, Isabella!"" Alexander shot back. ""I’ve been too easy on you. Apologize to Sophia, and I might take you back.""  
  
I stared at him, then burst into laughter. ""Even if you were the last man alive, Alexander, I would never be with you.""  
  
""What is that supposed to mean? How dare you speak to me like that?"" he roared.  
  
""Eight years, and you never wanted a child. Then I find out on the same day your son shoots me that Sophia is pregnant with your baby,"" I stated coldly.  
  
Alexander shot a quick, questioning look at Sophia, as if asking why she had told me.  
  
""We can discuss that later. Just come home. We can work this out,"" he said, softening his tone.  
  
""In your dreams,"" I retorted.  
  
I turned and walked away, ignoring his demands for me to stop.  
  
A short while later, I arrived at the airport just in time for my flight.  
  
As I was checking in and about to switch off my phone, it rang.  
  
It was Alexander. Reluctantly, I answered.  
  
""What do you want?"" I snapped.  
  
""I know you’re upset about Sophia’s pregnancy. Come home. Give me a child, and I’ll add your name to my will. You and your child will want for nothing,"" he said.  
  
""Go to hell, Alexander,"" I replied coldly.  
  
I hung up and blocked his number without another word.  
  
The flight was long. I slept through most of it, relieved when the plane finally landed.  
  
I stepped into the arrivals hall with my boxes and noticed a well-dressed man in a tuxedo holding a sign that read: Isabella Sterling.  
  
I approached him, and he recognized me immediately.  
  
""Miss Sterling, I’m Christopher. Your personal guard,"" he introduced himself.  
  
""Thank you,"" I said with a nod.  
  
He took my luggage, loaded it into the car, and opened the back door for me.  
  
I sank into the plush leather seat of the SUV, relaxing as we drove off. Soon, we arrived at a grand mansion.  
  
This was the home of my grandparents, Benjamin and Charlotte Sterling.  
  
Their company, Sterling Enterprises, was the largest in New York, and I was their only heir.  
  
Three years ago, they reached out and revealed they were my mother’s parents. My mother was supposed to marry someone else, but she eloped with my father for love and left her family behind.  
  
Unbeknownst to me, when my mother was dying of cancer, she had contacted them and told them about me.  
  
When they first asked me to take over, I was still deeply in love with Alexander and believed I could win his heart. I had refused their offer.  
  
""Isabella! Welcome home,"" my grandmother’s voice called out.  
  
She and my grandfather came outside and wrapped me in a warm embrace.  
  
""We’re so happy you’re here,"" they said.  
  
I smiled. ""Thank you for having me.""  
  
My grandmother waved a hand. ""Nonsense, Isabella. All of this is yours.""  
  
My grandfather nodded. ""Yes, Isabella. You are now the heiress of Sterling Enterprises.""  
  
I smiled.

Trois BU sont à disposition : la Bibliothèque Universitaire Droit Économie Gestion, ouverte jusqu’à 20h en semaine ; la Bibliothèque Universitaire Lettres, Langues et Sciences Humaines, également ouverte jusqu’à 20h ; et la Bibliothèque Universitaire Sciences Technologies STAPS, qui, quant à elle, offre une ouverture plus tardive jusqu’à 22h du lundi au jeudi, facilitant les révisions tardives.

Dans une ambiance conviviale similaire, le French Coffee Shop accueille également les étudiants jusqu’à 19h, proposant une sélection de cafés grands crus et une atmosphère chaleureuse pour étudier sans pression. Enfin, pour les plus nocturnes, le Starbucks situé rue des Halles est ouvert jusqu’à 20h30, offrant un espace plus vaste, adapté aussi bien à l’étude individuelle qu’aux travaux de groupe.

Par ailleurs, Orléans, située en région Centre-Val de Loire, bénéficie de nombreux espaces verts propices à l’étude en plein air, notamment durant la belle saison.

Que ce soit dans l’ambiance studieuse des bibliothèques universitaires, la convivialité des coffee shops ou la fraîcheur des espaces verts, chaque étudiant peut trouver un lieu qui lui convient pour travailler efficacement.

Even when I act upon it, every time I’m a fool in thinking that she might be interested. It sucks honestly. Sometimes I feel like if there was any procedure to delete this part of a human brain. It’s like a sick joke from which I never learn. It maybe human to have crushes, but lately I don’t even feel like doing about it anymore. I tried this year, I had a mild crush on her when I first met, but I backed off from doing anything about it for 2 years. Then this year what I thought, she might be into me (she gave all the typical signs of what it means when someone is interested in you, at least that’s what the internet says), she invited me over for dinner, things were normal until I asked if we could hangout over coffee the next day (because honest, despite of crushes, I wanted to know her better, her to let me in on her personal side as she appears to be a very closed off person), but she rejected it. I thought finally, this time I got my answer early on, but it still disappoints me and hurts me. Maybe I’m not meant for anyone. That’s it. Not seeking advice as I don’t really find anything helpful these days. It only comes from people who already have something going, and not for people in a somewhat similar boat as mine.

1nbf70v,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1nbf70v/aita_for_bringing_my_lawyer_boyfriend_to_divorce/,AITA for bringing my lawyer boyfriend to divorce court to bully my 'weak' IT husband?,"Edit: [with ALL UPDATES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpVhITD_mgg&t=421s)

My husband caught me cheating three months ago when my boyfriend's wife sent him our texts, and now I'm sitting in my empty house wondering how I lost everything to a man I thought was too weak to fight back.

I know how this sounds. But hear me out.

My boyfriend was this hotshot lawyer at a big firm downtown. We met when I needed help with a speeding ticket. He was charming, confident, everything my husband wasn't. My husband worked IT from home, barely talked to anyone, spent his evenings playing video games. After fifteen years of marriage, I felt invisible.

The affair started slow. Coffee meetings about my ticket turned into lunches. Lunches turned into hotel rooms. He promised me he was getting divorced. Said his wife was crazy, that she didn't understand him like I did. Classic lies, I know that now.

When my husband found out, I expected him to cry. Maybe beg. He just looked at me and said, ""Okay.""

That's it. Just okay.

He moved to the guest room that night. The next morning, divorce papers were already on the kitchen counter. I panicked. Called my boyfriend immediately.

""Don't sign anything,"" he told me. ""I'll handle this. Trust me.""

So I didn't sign. I thought I was being smart.

My boyfriend took over everything. Said my husband was trying to screw me over, that the papers were unfair. He convinced me to demand the house, alimony, half of everything. Even told me to go after my husband's retirement account.

""He's nobody,"" my boyfriend kept saying. ""I eat guys like him for breakfast in court.""

The day we went to court, my boyfriend was all confidence. My husband showed up alone, no lawyer, wearing the same old polo shirt he'd worn for years. My boyfriend actually laughed.

""This is going to be too easy,"" he whispered to me.

During mediation, my boyfriend went hard. Accused my husband of financial abuse, said he'd hidden assets. My husband just sat there taking notes on a yellow pad, not saying much. When he did speak, my boyfriend cut him off.

""Listen, buddy,"" my boyfriend said, leaning across the table. ""I do this for a living. The judge is a personal friend. You're going to leave here with nothing but the clothes on your back if you keep fighting this.""

My husband looked up from his notes. ""Interesting.""

That's all he said. Interesting.

My boyfriend kept pushing. Demanded my husband's inheritance from his grandmother. His vintage car collection. Even wanted him to pay my boyfriend's legal fees. I started feeling uncomfortable, but my boyfriend squeezed my hand under the table.

""Trust me,"" he whispered again.

Finally, my husband spoke up. ""Can I ask you something?""

""What?"" my boyfriend snapped.

""How long have you been practicing law?""

""Twelve years. Why?""

""And you specialize in family law?""

""Obviously.""

""Great. Then you know about Rule 1.7.""

The room went quiet. My boyfriend's face changed.

""What about it?""

""Well, you're representing someone you're having an affair with. That's a clear conflict of interest. Pretty basic ethics violation.""

My boyfriend started to respond, but my husband kept going.

""Also, you might want to check your firm's policy on representing clients you're romantically involved with. Page 47 of your employee handbook, if I remember correctly.""

""How do you...""

""Oh, and that judge you mentioned? Judge Harrison? We went to law school together. Same study group. I texted him last night about this case. He recused himself this morning. Check your email.""

My boyfriend pulled out his phone. His face went white.

My husband wasn't done. ""By the way, I recorded our conversation just now. You threatening me, claiming to have improper influence over a judge. The state bar might find that interesting.""

""You can't record without consent,"" my boyfriend said, but his voice was shaky now.

""Colorado is a one-party consent state. You should know that after twelve years of practice.""

That's when it hit me. ""You're a lawyer?""

My husband finally looked at me. ""Corporate law. Mergers and acquisitions. I work from home because I choose to, not because I can't do better.""

My boyfriend stood up. ""We're done here.""

""Sit down,"" my husband said. His voice was different now. Confident. ""We're not done until I say we're done.""

He pulled out a folder. ""Your wife hired a private investigator six months ago. These are photos of you with three different women. Including my wife. She's already filed for divorce. Your firm knows about this meeting today. HR knows about you taking fees from someone you're sleeping with. You'll be lucky if you're just fired and not disbarred.""

My boyfriend's hands were shaking. ""What do you want?""

""I want my original settlement signed. Today. I was more than fair. She keeps the house, I keep my retirement. Clean split. No alimony either direction.""

""Fine,"" my boyfriend said.

""And you're going to write my wife a check for the ten thousand dollars you've charged her so far for this circus.""

""I can't...""

""You can and you will. Unless you want me to file a formal complaint with the bar today.""

My boyfriend wrote the check. His hand was shaking so bad he had to write it twice.

After he left, practically running out of the room, I sat there staring at my husband. This stranger I'd been married to for fifteen years.

""Why didn't you tell me you were a lawyer?""

He shrugged. ""You never asked. You just assumed I was some boring IT guy because I worked from home and played video games to relax.""

""I don't understand. Why live like that? Why let me think...""

""Let you think what? That I wasn't good enough? That's on you, not me. I never lied about who I was. I just didn't feel the need to brag about it.""

He was right. I'd created this whole image of him being weak, boring, less than. Because he didn't wear suits or talk about big deals or try to impress people at parties.

""Your boyfriend's wife is going to take him for everything,"" he continued. ""His reputation is ruined. The affair will come out in their divorce. He'll probably lose his license. Hope he was worth it.""

I signed the papers. What else could I do?

That was six weeks ago. My boyfriend got fired the next day. His wife's divorce lawyer subpoenaed me as a witness. The bar association is investigating him. He texts me angry messages about how I ruined his life, like I forced him to sleep with a client and lie to everyone.

The house feels empty now. Too big. Too quiet. I keep replaying every dismissive thing I said about my husband over the years. Every time I rolled my eyes when he talked about his gaming. Every time I told my friends he was ""just in IT.""

He wasn't just in IT. He was a senior partner at one of the biggest firms in the state. Made three times what I thought he did. Could have destroyed me in court if he wanted to. Instead, he gave me the house and walked away clean.

I drove by his new place last week. Saw him through the window, playing games on that same computer I used to complain about. He looked happy. Relaxed. Free.

My sister says I got what I deserved. My mom won't talk to me after finding out the truth about why we divorced. My boyfriend's wife called me yesterday, crying, asking how I could do this to another woman. I didn't have an answer.

So I guess my question is: am I wrong to feel like the victim here when everyone seems to think I got off easy?",3,1757308750.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

I threw a glass of wine in my husband's face at his sister's wedding because he wouldn't let me give a speech about how I ""saved"" him from his trashy family.

We'd been together four years. Got engaged last summer. His family never liked me, probably because I made it clear from day one that I thought they were beneath me. My husband grew up poor. Like, sharing-a-bedroom-with-three-siblings poor. I came from money. Not crazy rich, but comfortable. Private school, nice cars, that sort of thing.

At first, dating him felt like charity work. I'd bring him to nice restaurants and watch him fumble with the wine list. ""Just let me order,"" I'd say. He'd get this look on his face, but he never argued. His friends were all blue collar guys who drank cheap beer and watched sports. Mine went to gallery openings and wine tastings. Guess which group we spent time with.

The affair started about a year ago. This guy from my Pilates class. Investment banker. Drove a Tesla. We'd get coffee after class, and he'd actually understand when I complained about my husband's family. ""You deserve better,"" he'd say. One thing led to another.

I kept seeing both of them. My husband had no clue. He was too busy working overtime at his construction job, trying to save up for a house. ""We don't need your parents' money,"" he'd tell me when I suggested asking them for a down payment. Pride. So stupid.

The wedding was the breaking point. His sister was marrying some mechanic. The whole thing was so tacky. Backyard reception, grocery store flowers, a DJ playing country music. I'd had three glasses of wine when I decided someone needed to give a real speech.

I stood up, tapped my fork against my glass. My husband grabbed my arm. ""Don't,"" he said quietly.

""Someone needs to class this place up,"" I told him. Loud enough for his mother to hear.

That's when he said it. ""Sit down. Now.""

""Or what? You'll leave me? Please. You'd be living in a trailer without me.""

The whole tent went quiet. His sister was staring at me, mouth open. His mother had tears in her eyes.

""I said sit down,"" he repeated.

""Make me.""

So I threw my wine at him. Merlot all over his rented tux. In front of his entire family. His cousins, his grandparents, everyone.

He didn't yell. Didn't even wipe his face. Just looked at me and said, ""We're done.""

""You can't be serious.""

""Your ring's fake anyway,"" he said. ""Had to buy you a fake because you demanded a three-carat stone I couldn't afford. Figured someone as fake as you deserved it.""

His cousin started laughing. Then his brother. Soon half the tent was cracking up. My face burned. I stormed out, called my affair partner from the parking lot. Told him I was finally free, we could be together for real now.

""Oh,"" he said after a long pause. ""That's... great. Listen, I need to tell you something. My wife and I are working things out.""

Wife. He'd never mentioned a wife.

That was six months ago. My husband kept the apartment since he'd been paying most of the rent. I moved back with my parents, but they cut me off after finding out about the affair. ""We didn't raise you to be cruel,"" my mother said.

I work retail now. Can barely make rent on my studio apartment. Last week I ran into my ex-husband's sister at Target. She took one look at my name tag and smiled. ""Karma's something, huh?""

My ex is dating someone new. A teacher. His family loves her. I know because his mom posts about it constantly, and yeah, I still check.

The investment banker blocked me after I showed up at his office. Security escorted me out. His wife was pregnant, turns out.

Sometimes I drive past my ex's new house. Yeah, he bought one. Without my family's money. Without me. His truck's always in the driveway next to a sensible sedan. There's a garden out front now. He always wanted a garden.

I gave up everything because I thought I was better than him and his family. Turns out I was just an asshole who forgot that money doesn't make you a good person.

Am I wrong to still think his family should've given me another chance?

1nbf1pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnglishLearning/comments/1nbf1pc/i_was_that_person_who_could_read_english_reddit/,I was that person who could read English Reddit but couldn't speak to save my life. Here's what changed.,"Three years ago I could read English articles just fine. I wrote emails at work. But if someone walked up to me and said ""Hi"" in English? I'd freeze up completely.  
  
Now I run a couple English learning apps and actually talk to users in English all the time. Still mess up grammar but whatever.  
  
The weird thing is my grammar didn't really improve that much. What changed was I stopped caring about sounding stupid.  
  
I remember this one time I was testing my own app in a coffee shop. Some foreign guy heard me practicing and said ""Dude, your English is totally fine, you just look terrified.""   
  
That hit me hard. I wasn't bad at English. I was just scared of being wrong.  
  
So I started doing this thing where I'd record voice messages to myself every day. Just random stuff. ""Today I ate noodles. The weather sucks. My code isn't working."" Super boring but it helped.  
  
Then I started talking to strangers on language exchange apps. Made tons of mistakes. Said ""I go to yesterday"" instead of ""I went yesterday"" probably a thousand times. Nobody died.  
  
Here's what I learned from building these apps and watching how people actually use them:  
  
People who talk (badly) for 5 minutes every day get way better than people who study grammar for hours. Like not even close.  
  
The biggest thing stopping most people isn't their English level. It's being okay with sounding weird for a while.  
  
I still say weird stuff all the time. Last week I told someone I ""take a shower with my dog"" when I meant ""walk my dog after shower."" We all laughed. Life went on.  
  
Anyone else deal with this? Like you can read stuff fine but talking feels impossible? What helped you get over it?

Strategic Music for Everything Different playlists for different energy levels. Upbeat pop for cleaning, lo-fi for focusing, classical for deep work, binaural beats for concentration. I literally have a ""transition song"" that plays between tasks to reset my brain. Noise-cancelling headphones make this 10x more effective.

Background Audio is Your Friend Playing true crime podcasts, YouTube videos, or even live court hearings while doing chores tricks my brain into thinking it's multitasking. The chatty part of my mind gets occupied so my body can work on autopilot. It's like having a conversation buddy who never expects me to respond.

White, Brown, and Pink Noise Noise generators with good headphones block distractions and calm my racing mind, especially in public spaces. Game changer for coffee shop work sessions.

Talk to Yourself Out Loud I verbalize every step while working. ""Now I'm checking this email, then I'll file it here."" Sounds crazy but it keeps my thoughts organized and prevents that mental fog drift.

The Documentary Narrator Trick I pretend I'm making a tutorial while doing boring tasks. ""Now I'm loading the dishwasher, making sure to scrape this plate first."" My brain stays engaged and I actually finish things now.

Engage Multiple Senses Eating strong mints while watching videos or chewing gum during reading occupies one sense so others can focus better. Counter-intuitive but it works.

Task Switching Instead of Fighting Work on two projects at once and switch when focus fades on one. Sounds chaotic but it matches how my brain naturally wants to work.

Fidget Tools Everywhere Tangle toys during meetings, stress balls while reading, exercise bands under my desk. Keeping my hands busy helps my mind stay present.

Physical Reset Between Tasks I do jumping jacks or touch my toes when switching activities. The movement signals to my brain that we're starting something new.

Location-Based Brain Training Desk equals work plus focus music. Bed equals sleep or mindless scrolling only. My brain now automatically switches modes based on where I am.

The Uniform Method Specific clothes for different tasks. Apron for cooking, business shirt for work calls, cleaning gloves for deep cleaning. It's like having a work costume that actually works.

Some of these strategies might sound odd to people who have never lived with ADHD, but together, they let me hack my own sense of focus. If you have your own rituals or tricks, please share them. Sometimes the weirdest ideas are the most effective, and you just might have the secret that helps someone else finally feel in control.

1nbez35,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1nbez35/aita_for_leaving_my_husband_after_our_anniversary/,"AITA for leaving my husband after our anniversary for a ""pleasure trip"" with my affair partner and threatening to call the cops if he stopped me?","Edit: [with ALL UPDATES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kh31LUM05w&t=288s)

My husband found the hotel receipt in my car while I was in the shower with my phone, and by the time I got out, he'd already packed up the kids and left.

I know how that sounds. Trust me, I know. But I need to know if I'm really the worst person alive here or if maybe, just maybe, he overreacted.

We've been married eight years. Two kids, ages 6 and 4. Things got stale. You know how it is. Same conversations about whose turn it is to do bedtime. Same arguments about money. Same everything.

About four months ago, I reconnected with an old college friend on Facebook. Just catching up at first. Then texting. Then meeting for coffee when he was in town for work. You can probably see where this is going.

Last weekend was our anniversary. My husband planned this whole thing. Dinner at the place we had our first date. Even got his mom to watch the kids overnight. And I went. I smiled. I ate the salmon. I opened the jewelry box with the earrings I'd pointed out months ago.

But the whole time, all I could think about was that my friend had booked us a suite downtown for the next day.

So Sunday morning, I told my husband I was going to visit my sister. She lives two hours away, perfect cover. He barely looked up from making the kids pancakes. Just said ""drive safe"" and went back to flipping.

I spent Sunday through Tuesday at that hotel. Three days. Told my husband my sister was having a crisis and needed me. He handled the kids, work, everything. Didn't even question it.

When I got home Tuesday night, he was putting the kids to bed. Asked how my sister was doing. I made up some story about her and her boyfriend fighting. He nodded, said he was glad I could be there for her.

Wednesday morning, I was in the shower when I heard him yelling. Not at the kids. Just yelling. Then nothing. When I got out, wrapped in a towel, the house was empty. His car gone. Kids gone. My phone was on the bed with about forty missed calls already coming in.

The hotel receipt was on my pillow. Right next to a printed screenshot of my credit card statement showing three days of room charges.

My mom called first. ""What did you do?"" That's all she said. No hello.

Then his sister. Then his mom. Then my dad. Everyone knew. He'd sent a group text to both our families with photos of the receipt and the credit card statement. The text just said: ""She spent our anniversary weekend with another man. I have the kids. We're safe. Please give us space.""

I tried calling him maybe a hundred times. Straight to voicemail. I drove to his brother's house. His mom's. His best friend's. Nobody would tell me where he was. His sister actually opened her door just to say ""You spent your anniversary weekend with another man"" and then slammed it in my face.

By Thursday, I was at my mom's house because I couldn't stand being in our empty home. She let me in but the first thing she said was, ""Three days? You lied for three days?""

My friend, the one from the hotel, he ghosted me completely. Read receipts off. Profile deactivated. Like he never existed.

Friday afternoon, I got one text from my husband: ""Lawyer will contact you Monday. Kids are fine. Don't come looking for us.""

I tried to text back that we needed to talk, that he can't just take the kids, that I'd call the police if he didn't bring them home. His response was immediate: ""Go ahead. Tell them how you abandoned your children for three days to have an affair. See how that goes.""

My mom actually laughed when she read that over my shoulder. Not a nice laugh either.

It's been two weeks now. The lawyer sent papers. He's filed for divorce and emergency custody. The kids are with him at his brother's place. I get supervised visits twice a week at a neutral location. My four-year-old asked why daddy cries at night. My six-year-old won't even look at me.

My dad called yesterday. First time since the group text. All he said was, ""Your grandmother's ring. The one your mother gave you for your wedding. Mail it back. You don't deserve it anymore.""

The worst part? My husband never yelled at me. Never called me names. When I see him at the visits, he's polite. Distant. Like I'm a stranger. Somehow that hurts more than anger would.

My friend from college? I found out through mutual friends that he's married too. Has been the whole time. His wife is pregnant with their third kid.

My mom says I should be grateful my husband didn't put me on blast on social media, just told family. She says I should sign whatever he wants and hope maybe in a few years I can rebuild some kind of relationship with my kids.

I keep thinking about that Sunday morning. Him making pancakes. Telling me to drive safe. He had no idea his wife was about to spend three days in a hotel with another man while he handled everything at home.

But was taking the kids really necessary? Sending that text to everyone? The supervised visits? I messed up, I know that. But destroying everything in one morning?

Am I wrong for thinking he went too far?

Next Sunday, September 14, we will be joining 650+ communities around the world for the Terry Fox Run - and we hope you'll come, too.

Our run takes place at the Municipal Campground by Brennan Park (39275 Loggers Lane). You can register online here (https://run.terryfox.ca/93006) or at 9:30 AM in-person the day of. Our opening ceremonies kick off at 10 AM (guest speakers! bag pipes!), and then it's off to the races. 

The route is a very flat, very mellow, very paved out-and-back to the Adventure Centre and totals about 4km, although super keeners are welcome to run it twice. You can walk, run, or wheel the course, and well-behaved leashed pups are more than welcome. Kids can bring bikes and scooters if the 4km feels a little daunting.

If you're unfamiliar with Canadian icon Terry Fox, this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1QOtPDAAeY) will tell you his story. Since Terry died, Canadians have been running in his honour and continuing his quest to raise funds for cancer research. Squamish's first run was back in 1989 and this year, we're set to pass the $200K mark as funds raised in our community over the years. Having said that, this event is open to EVERYONE - there is no minimum donation amount, no entry fee, etc. Pay what you can, it's for a good cause! 

What else do you need to know?

* Free snacks, coffee, and post-event BBQ
* Monty Biggins will be playing live at the finish line
* There will be fun family stuff to check out
* We'll be selling the 2025 ""Finish It"" Terry Fox t-shirts (sold out online) for $30 each, $25 for youth sizes
* You can honour your favourite cancer-ass-kicking loved ones with an ""I'm running for..."" sticker and by writing/drawing a message on our event poster
* You call follow us on Instagram at SquamishTerryFox or look us up on Facebook for details on this year's run and photos from past events

I think that's it. This post is long, but **I need you to know that this is an absolutely electric event**. Last year was my first year as co-organizer and I had goosebumps for days. The horrible fact is that all of us have been affected by cancer in some way. The Terry Fox Run is emotional, hopeful, and inspiring all at once, and the magic is amplified knowing that communities across Canada (and the world) are all doing the same thing at the same time.

If you’re in a frat or sorority at Mizzou, chances are you’ve already had someone invite you to a “super chill” StuMo Bible study or mention Kaleo like it’s the best summer of your life. Let me just say this: **it’s not chill. At all.**

Here’s what people don’t tell you until you’re way too deep:

* **The staff never leave.** Like, ever. You think you’re just hanging out with cool older mentors, but these are grown adults in their late 20s/30s who literally still lurk around Greek houses. Imagine graduating and still pulling up to chapter dinners because you “have a heart for freshmen.”
* **Greek Life is their hunting ground.** They specifically target frats and sororities because that’s where they can grab large groups of freshmen at once. They’ll use mixers, “Bible studies,” or random coffee invites to lock you in. Once you say yes once, expect texts, DMs, and “drop-bys” nonstop.
* **Kaleo is basically spiritual boot camp.** Picture this: you pay thousands to be crammed with 10 other girls into one room with 2 beds total. You work a 40+ hour job during the day, and then every spare second is scheduled by StuMo. No missing anything StuMo related?
* **They control your relationships.** Dating? They’ll tell you who’s “godly enough.” Friendships? If your friend isn’t in StuMo, you’ll be pressured to cut them off because they’re a “distraction.” Even your future is mapped out for you... there’s this unspoken path of recruit > disciple > staff > recruit more. Your entire social life and mental health will be damaged.
* **Weird obsession with modesty + marriage.** Women especially get told to cover up, act a certain way, and basically prep to be a pastor’s wife. Guys get pushed into hyper-leadership roles. Your whole identity gets reduced to how useful you are for recruiting the next wave of members.
* **The guilt trip is constant.** Skip a Bible study? You’re “turning away from God.” Want to go to a movie with non-StuMo friends? That’s “wasting time on worldly things.” Feel burnt out and want to leave? Suddenly you’re “walking away from your faith.” They don’t just guilt you into staying, they train you to guilt yourself.

Here’s the thing: I met a lot of genuinely kind people in StuMo. They believe they’re doing good. But the structure is toxic and ingenuine. It blurs every normal boundary, eats up your time, isolates you from the outside world, and wraps it all up in religious language so you feel like you can’t question it. If you’re in Greek Life, be smart. If someone says “you should come to this Bible study, it’s not just a casual hang. It’s a recruitment pipeline.",15,1757306927.0,mizzou,3,0.94,False

When I decided I wanted to get high on Benadryl - of all things - you must understand I was not in the most rational of mental places.

I was going through a breakup, of course, and I was just a stupid guy trying to find out who I am. I won’t bore you with details of that failed relationship, but in short, she told me she felt like I had no personality, no edge of my own. She was the love of my life, and I hadn’t seen this coming, so you understand that I took this pretty hard. I started to feel like she was right, that I didn’t have my own identity. I always thought I was just an easy going person who went with the flow- but apparently the people you love can view that as dull.

Now, the apartment was mine. It felt too big for me all of a sudden. I didn’t have nearly as many possessions as she did, and she took most of the good furniture. This was fair, it was hers originally and I wasn’t necessarily much of an interior designer in the first place. But the two bedroom flat that was now all mine felt just too cold. Her absence was steadily present to me in the weeks following the breakup. Whenever I cooked for myself, I kept making too much food. And, kind of depressing, I kept making the recipes that she had always really enjoyed. At night, in what used to be our bed, I only occupied my side. Even though, within me, I knew she would never take space in what used to be her side ever again.

Alright, maybe I did burden you with the sad details of my failed relationship. It’s just all I can think about now, all I can wish for to be the most of my problems. Especially after what happened to me last week.

I mostly keep good company, I have about two solid friends I’ve kept over the course of graduating university. There was Justin, who I had known since high school, and had always been a reliable and cool guy to hang out with. Then there was Lars. Lars had always been a “loose cannon”-- or at least that is what my ex used to call him. And she wasn’t wrong. Lars and I had met in college, but he dropped out shortly after. We hung out frequently, actually, despite our pretty transparent personality differences. I think I was Lars’s rock, and Lars was my wild card. We benefited off each other in a weird way; I kept Lars grounded to reason, and Lars knew how to get me to loosen up. He wasn’t a shitty guy, he just dabbled in certain drug experimentation and minor criminal activities that just weren’t my speed. Nothing intense enough to warrant any serious concern, at least in my opinion. Some weed here, some very minor shoplifting there.

Lars was a good guy though. I trusted him. With everything he screwed up in his life, he never pressured me in any way to fuck up my own. It was a few days after she had moved out, though. Lars and I had just been texting, and he mentioned something he read on online forums. He said people were taking large doses of Benadryl, to get high and hallucinate. Y’know -- Benadryl, what I thought was a kids’ allergy medication? I laughed at first, but he said it was definitely legit, and that he had done it years ago before it was more of a trend. Now, I’ve known Lars to exaggerate, so I did not take his claim that seriously. But he started talking about how it did make him hallucinate, and that he saw the most beautiful angels in the world, and he had never felt more spiritual in his life. I frowned slightly reading his long texts. He was by no means a religious guy in the time I’ve known him. But Lars was speaking about this like it was an insane spiritual experience, and at one point he started gently encouraging me to experiment with this. I hesitated. Lars had offered me many a variety of substances in the past, but when I would always refuse he would not press me. He was a nice guy like that. This time, I asked him how serious he was about his experiences. 

Maybe it was because when I heard the name Benadryl, I just thought of a harmless medication. It wasn’t scary, like marijuana or cocaine was. Just taking too much liquid medicine didn’t sound so bad. And if it made him feel euphoric, well maybe….maybe it was just my current unpleasant emotional state, but I was willing to try something stupid like that. And I trusted Lars. I told him I might try it out and let him know how it goes. He didn’t seem concerned, or surprised, in the slightest. The last thing he said was “Have fun, guy :)”.

Cut to the next Friday night. It was 5 pm, and for some reason I thought that was an acceptable time to start tripping on over the counter medication. I started with a normal dose of liquid Benadryl. It was sickeningly sweet, and the viscous liquid hung on my tongue longer than I liked. As a child, I had always hated the artificial syrup flavor of liquid meds. My mom would have to bribe me with cookies or soda, but even up to the age of 8 or 9 I would still cry if I had to endure a swig of icky medicine. And here I was now, a grown adult, taking drinks of it for fun.
I cringed at the bitter taste, but poured another dose right away. I figured I would start slow, and just go a little over the recommended dose for an adult my size. I finished off the second dose, set down the bottle on my coffee table, and waited. I was sitting on my sofa, with cable TV playing mostly for background. It was a Seinfeld rerun, I think.

Half an hour went by. I checked my watch to be sure, having felt next to nothing. Maybe a bit drowsy, but that could have been in my head. Honestly, I had started to space out watching the TV and forgot about my drug endeavor. I shifted to the edge of the sofa to take another two doses of Benadryl. It went down smoother this time, and I almost enjoyed it. Once again, I slumped back into my sofa, mindlessly watching TV.

Time passed weirdly. I looked at the watch on my wrist, and it said another half hour had passed. I really though it had only been about 2 minutes. I looked to the bottle of medication on the coffee table, preparing to take another dose since I was pretty convinced I was feeling nothing freaky. As I sat up to confront the bottle of Benadryl, mocking me from the coffee table, I could have sworn it was much emptier than it should have been. This didn’t concern me, at the time. I tipped my head back and sipped one more dose.

It started out of the corner of my eye.

The dull roar of the TV barely registered to my ears.  I sat on the edge of the cushion, slouched over, my arms hanging limply by legs. Just feeling. I noticed a movement in my peripheral vision, but I felt no surprise or concern. Like I was anticipating it, waiting for this to happen.

It was a figure, in the hallway that separates my two bedrooms. It was just barely peeking out behind the wall. It was only blackness and shadow. I was so still when I registered its presence, that I wondered with a foggy mind if I had already fallen asleep and this was a bad dream.

It was tall. Very tall. Its head brushed the ceiling, which stood about 7 feet if I remembered correctly. It was only shadow, but what I could make out from the corner of my vision, I could see eyes as well. Two eyes, peering from around the corner of the wall. They were large, too large. It was like the eyes of someone experiencing so much fear that they might pop out of their sockets. Their eyes were incredibly white, their irises were much too black.

It all happened very fast. As soon as I registered this thing’s presence from the corner of my peripheral, my head snapped in its direction.

Nothing. The hallway was empty. I let go of a breath I didn't know I was holding. 

My hands were shaking, but I did not genuinely think anything weird was going on. I had gotten freaked out by the dark before, and now that I was alone in the apartment, it was bound to happen more often. I shook my head, and blinked my eyes rapidly. Looking around, I saw nothing out of the ordinary. The sound of the TV faded into my attention, and I felt more grounded. Taking a deep breath, I picked up the Benadryl bottle again, taking another dose. At the time, I did not think I was in any danger. I thought I just got spooked by the dark. I had to adjust to living alone after the breakup, and I frequently found myself jumpy and nervous at the silence of an empty home.

This time, the medicine tasted much better. I think I was coming around to it. The sweet, intoxicating taste lingered on my tongue, and I sank back into the lush, soft cushions of my couch.

I couldn’t tell you how much time had passed before the TV started to became wrong. Seinfeld was one of my favorite 90s shows to just watch and shut off my brain. But now, after writing this, and after everything that has happened, I can’t stand to have it on without feeling sick. But that night, I was staring into space, watching the television and enjoying the tiny buzz I could feel in my veins. This must be the nice high Lars was talking about, I thought to myself. Not too bad. I wasn't a big drinker, it often made me sick to my stomach faster than I could catch a buzz. But this, this was pleasant.

I saw it on the television. No, I saw it in the television program. In Jerry Seinfeld’s apartment. I was watching the actors of the show bicker about god knows what, when I noticed the camera had been still for much too long. Focused on one angle of the apartment set. The actors weren't even centered in on the shot, it didn't make sense. Then I saw why. In the background, where I know the set disappears into nonexistent bedrooms, a figure peered around the corner of the wall. The same one I had seen before, in the corner of my eye. But now, I saw it in full view. Something was wrong though. The TV glitched in ways that it shouldn't have. I don’t have a very old television set, so these kinds of glitches weren’t typical. The pixels around the thing were glitching wildly, to where I could barely tell if it was even there. But I knew. I knew it was there. A low hum started. I frowned, and clicked the volume down on the remote. It didn’t stop, though, and it actually got louder. Eventually, it began to drown out the dialogue of the show. I could only sit, frozen, not knowing what to do. The sound hurt my ears, like a million bees buzzing around my head. Inside my head, my brain.

After a while, I couldn't hear anything but the hum, though it had evolved into something much more disturbing. Almost a scream. Was it a scream? The eyes of the thing did not waver. They fixated on the camera. Through the camera. On me.

The darkness of that shadow figure seemed to spread across the screen, in progression with the ever increasing scream that replaced the original television audio. 

When I finally blinked, I realized I had been crying. Tears streamed down my cheeks. I checked my watch again. I had been watching this fucked up TV progression for nearly 40 minutes.	Looking up from my watch, I saw my television screen had gone black. There was only an error message, but it was one I had never seen before. I owned a Smart TV, and I recognized common error messages like when my internet had temporarily gone out. This one was weird. The font was weird, and seemed almost inconsistent, like somebody’s handwriting. It simply read:



“ERROR! we couldn’t find what you are looking for. have you tri̴̡̧̼̳͖̰̞͓̳̣̪͒̅̀̓̆̆̈́̂̓̇̽͊͑͛̄̒̚1é̷̩̦̹̪̯͋͐̓̌̕̕͠͠͝d̵͔̱̪̗̞̣̍̅͑̓̈̓͗̍̇̎̎̎̏͌̌͠͠ ̶̛͔̹̦͙̻̪̘̜͓̣̮͎̮̩̦̪͒͊͂̈́͝y̶̢̰̬̽̃̑̿̀́̉̈́̍̈̈́͋̓͋̚̚͠0ǫ̴̛̤̫̱̳̩͎͎͂͒͗̕͝ú̸̧͈͇͚͚̞̈́̎͝ͅṟ̴͕̼̘͔̞̯̪̲̻̫̻̲͇̳̫̣̃̈́̇͗̎̈́͊͆̆̊̀̅͂̚ ̸̧̻̆̒̈́͗̈́̆̈́ͅb̷̧̧͓̻̤̩͊́̈́̿͌̅͑̃̾͐̈́̚e̴̡̢͉̙̪̼̮̱̱̜̖̬̣͑̋͒̄̇͂͛͝͝ḑ̷͓͕̣̙͎͍̗̪̮̻͍̫͗̆̃͗́́̇̃͝r̵̨̡̡̞̻̲̰͎͖̟̤̦͈͉̃̈́͊̽̒̐̑̇̎̄ō̷̟̄́̃̋̎̐̊̋̕̕̚0ȏ̵͕̮͕̖̞̙̪̬̩͇̀̈̆͗̅̈́̌̑̍̐͂͂̐͑̚͘m̴̮̹̗̦͉͊͒͑͊̾̃̀̑͋͒̋̈́̀̕͘͜͠?̷̨̧̗͇̼͎̤̲̞̺͍͐̐́̈́͑?̵̧̧̛͇̙͍͓̰͙̯̖͖̻̯̘͑̓̂̽͆̂́̓͌̌̚̚ͅ??̵̺̯̈́͑̓̂͠?





I couldn’t read the last few words, the glitching screen obscured them too much.

I haven't been back to my apartment since that night. It's been one week. Lars opened his door to me sobbing on his porch, and I've been crashing on his couch since. I told him what happened, and he apologized profusely. He said he didn't think I would actually go through with it on my own, and that hallucinations and fear are common bad side effects when messing with certain substances. I assured him it was okay and I didn't blame him for what I had done. It did touch me that despite how reckless he was with his own life and decisions, he was incredibly empathetic when it came to affecting the life of his friends. Lars is a good friend.

I'm glad I have someone to confide in with my situation. Because nearly all Benadryl has left my system, and I should be back to normal. But every night the past week, as I lie on Lars’s couch, I see a figure standing in the hallway. Looking at me, as I try to fall asleep.

1nbeikk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nbeikk,AI Prompting Guide: From Keywords to Storytelling,"**Mindset Shift: From “Keyword Stacking” to “Scene Storytelling”**  
Stop thinking of prompts as just stacking keywords. Think of them more like instructions for an art director.

With tools like Gemini, you don’t have to pile on command after command anymore. Instead, you can describe the scene, almost like telling a story.

You’ll notice that your images start to make sense, your characters stay consistent across scenes, and the lighting feels natural and cohesive.

It all starts with shifting how you think about it. Treat Gemini as a partner, not just a tool. The more detail you give, the better and more surprising the results.

# Six Key Elements of a Perfect Prompt

1. **Subject:** Who or what is in the scene? (Example: a blue-haired witch sipping coffee, or a black cat perched on a wizard’s shoulder)
2. **Composition:** How is it framed? (Example: close-up, wide shot, low-angle shot, portrait shot)
3. **Action:** What is happening? (Example: sipping coffee, flipping through a book, walking through the forest)
4. **Location:** Where is the scene taking place? (Example: a futuristic café on Mars, an ancient library, a sunlit meadow)
5. **Style:** What is the overall aesthetic? (Example: 3D rendering, monochrome, watercolor, cinematic lighting, 1990s anime style)
6. **Editing Notes:** Any additional refinements? (Example: add raindrops on the window, remove a car in the background)

# Step 1: Text-to-Image Creation

# 1. Capturing Photorealism: Photo-like Realistic Scenes

Think like a photographer: describe lighting, lens, angle, and detail to generate professional-level photos.

**Template:**  
“A photo of \[subject\], \[action or emotion\], in \[environment\]. The scene features \[lighting setup\] and conveys \[atmosphere\]. Taken with \[camera/lens details\], emphasizing \[textures/details\]. Format: widescreen.”

**Example:**  
“A portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramic artist, with deep wrinkles and a warm smile. He is seated in his sunlit workshop, surrounded by clay tools. A golden afternoon glow filters through the window. Shot with an 85mm portrait lens, background softly blurred. The atmosphere is calm and professional.”

# 2. Creative Freedom: Illustrations & Stickers

Use for PPT, social media, or websites. Define the style and ensure a white background for easy use.

**Template:**  
“A \[style\]-themed \[subject\] sticker, featuring \[key traits\] and \[color palette\]. The design includes \[line style\] and \[shadow/highlight style\]. Background must be white.”

**Example:**  
“A kawaii-style sticker of a panda wearing a tiny bamboo hat, happily munching on bamboo leaves. Designed with bold, clean lines and a playful palette. Background must be white.”

# 3. Text Magic: Rendering Words Within Images

Gemini is excellent at embedding text into images. Just specify the text, font, and style.

**Template:**  
“Create a \[type of image\] for \[brand/concept\], featuring the text \[target text\]. The font style is \[font description\]. The design is \[style description\]. Color scheme: \[palette\].”

**Example:**  
“Create a modern, minimalist logo for a café named *The Luncky D*ay The text uses a clean, sans-serif font. Design includes a coffee bean motif with geometric shapes. Colors: black and white.”

# 4. Commercial Shots: Product Mockups & Business Photography

Generate high-quality product photos for e-commerce or advertising.

**Template:**  
“A high-resolution product photo of \[product\], placed in \[scene\]. Lighting: \[setup\]. Camera angle: \[type\], emphasizing \[details\]. Ultra-realistic, sharp focus. Widescreen format.”

**Example:**  
“A high-res studio photo of a matte black ceramic coffee mug on a textured stone tabletop. Lighting: soft side light with warm highlights. Camera angle: 45 degrees. Ultra-realistic with visible steam rising.”

# 5. Minimalism: Clean Design & Visual Focus

Perfect for presentations or text overlays.

**Template:**  
“A minimal composition with \[subject\] at \[position\]. Background: plain \[color\]. Lighting: soft and subtle. Widescreen format.”

**Example:**  
“A minimalist image of a single red maple leaf at the bottom-right corner on a plain gray canvas. Large negative space for text. Soft light from the top-left.”

# 6. Storytelling: Storyboards & Comic Panels

Turn images into narratives.

**Template:**  
“A single-panel comic in \[art style\]. Foreground: \[character/action\]. Background: \[details\]. Dialogue bubble: \[text\]. Lighting: \[mood\]. Widescreen.”

**Example:**  
“A noir-style comic panel of a detective in a trench coat walking in the rain. Neon lights glow in the mist. Dialogue bubble: ‘Another night, another case.’ Lighting: cinematic high contrast.”

# Step 2: Image Editing

# 1. Add/Remove/Modify: Easy Element Editing

Specify changes to seamlessly modify images.

**Template:**  
“In the provided \[subject\] photo, \[add/remove/modify\] \[element\]. Ensure consistency with original lighting and style.”

**Example:**  
“Add a small wizard hat on the cat in the provided sofa photo. The hat blends with the light and shadows naturally.”

# 2. Precision Tweaks: Partial Edits & Replacements

Edit specific parts of an image without changing the rest.

**Template:**  
“In the provided photo, replace \[element\] with \[new element\]. Keep all else unchanged.”

**Example:**  
“Replace the blue sofa in the living room photo with a vintage brown leather Chesterfield, keeping the rest identical.”

# 3. Style Transfer: Instantly Transform into an Art Master

Turn any photo into a masterpiece in the style of great artists.

**Template:**  
“Transform the provided \[subject\] photo into the style of \[artist/art style\]. Keep the original composition, but render using \[style details\].”

**Example:**  
“Transform a nighttime city photo into Van Gogh’s *Starry Night* style. Keep buildings and cars, but render with swirling strokes, thick brushwork, and vibrant blues and yellows.”

# 4. Ultimate Fusion: Combining Multiple Images

Use multiple sources to create one seamless composition.

**Template:**  
“Combine elements from the provided images to build a new scene. Place \[element from Image 1\] with \[element from Image 2\]. Final result: \[scene description\].”

**Example:**  
“Create a professional e-commerce fashion photo. Take the denim outfit from the first image and have the woman in the second image wear it. Generate a realistic full-body shot of the woman wearing the denim outfit, adjusting lighting and shadows to match an outdoor environment.”

# Advanced Tips: Best Practices for Perfection

* **Details, details, details!** The more details you give, the more precise the output. Example: *“A knight’s armor with emerald inlays and ornate engravings, polished with silver trims.”*
* **Iterate often.** Don’t expect perfection in one try. Refine with conversational prompts: “Great pose, but soften the lighting,” etc.
* **Avoid vagueness.** Be specific. Not “a cool night scene,” but “an empty street with neon reflections on wet pavement.”
* **Explain your intention.** Tell the model *why* you want certain edits. Example: “Add fog to create a cinematic mystery vibe.”
* **Use photography terms.** Mention lens types, e.g., “85mm portrait lens,” for professional realism.
* **Watch the aspect ratio.** Gemini defaults to square. Specify widescreen (16:9) if needed.",1,1757306378.0,AICircle,0,1.0,False

Looking for individuals that share common interests that would love to join me. The last one I attended changed the trajectory of my life. 
One thing I’ve been reflecting on lately is how much our lives and opportunities are shaped by the people we surround ourselves with. In our country, we often hear “your network is your net worth” and it’s true. Whether it’s in business, career growth, or even personal development, putting yourself out there and connecting with the right people can open doors you didn’t even know existed. Networking doesn’t always have to look like a formal event with business cards. Sometimes it’s as simple as grabbing a coffee with someone new, having a meaningful conversation, or building a friendship that eventually grows into collaboration. It can feel uncomfortable to step outside of our comfort zones, but if you want to get further in life, sometimes the biggest breakthroughs come from the people you meet and the connections you nurture. Zambia is full of brilliant, driven, and inspiring people but you have to be intentional about finding them.

On that note, if there are any ladies here between 25–30 who’d like to hang out, connect, and maybe even build a little network of our own as well as attend the upcoming event, I’d be happy to link up.

Dates: Between 5-7 nights starting 01/09/2025

Location: Open to any locations in Mexico or the Caribbean

Vibe: We are looking for more of a quiet vibe, yet with things to do. It does not necessarily need to be adult only.

Pool: We would love to have a pool and hot tub available.

Food: We would like relatively good food, and coffee available.

Drinks: We are not huge drinkers so not too concerned about alcohol offerings. 

Activities: This is probably the biggest priority. We would love to have different water sport options and other sports/activities (classes, gym, tennis/pickleball, etc) 

Budget: Anything less than $4,000 total (not including flights)

New boy is in the bedroom, we're going into week 4 of introductions. We have done all the Jackson Galaxy method steps up to visuals behind a gate. When we introduced our first two cats, this was done in a week and a half and I'm starting to realize that was a blessing because I don't know how we can co-exist at this point. I know it can and likely will happen, I'm just getting annoyed feeling so anxious about this all the time.

Oldest resident is pretty comfortable around new boy when there's a gate. Girl resident is still hesitant but curious, extremely hissy around him since day one, currently if he gets too close to her. Oldest resident does a low meow when he's unsure, and then hisses when new boy gets too close.

We've tried sharing spaces and it makes me so anxious because my oldest resident will sit in a comfort area of his (a corner of the room), so if new boy walks up to him he's already cornered and defensive. New boy usually respects boundaries, but he wants to play with them so badly. We've had one slappy moment between new boy and resident girl when she was on the coffee table and he was looking up at her interested in going up, and one spat no claws with the two boys once, both a week ago. Taking things more slowly with more site swapping and visuals behind the pet gate, but at what point do we need them to just communicate with each other in the same room? I know hissing is healthy and normal but I have one cat who hisses and then runs away, and another that hisses and stands up to him...nothing outwardly super aggressive but I get very anxious any time I see him getting visibly agitated.

This is also a lot on my husband and me mentally, dealing with this every day for longer than we anticipated. I know introductions can take time, but we have some trips coming up and a temporary relocation due to construction on our unit that will require all three cats to live elsewhere with us for a week...that's making this even more of a concern for the ability to coexist.

1nbedk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1nbedk0/avoiding_caffeine/,Avoiding caffeine?,"Ive heard a couple times now that caffeine should be avoided because it really affects the cortisol levels negatively, which in turn can worsten symptoms depending on what type of PCOS you have. 

Did anyone here give up coffee ? 
It's such a big part of my morning routine and I love just waking up and having a nice cold iced coffee while I get ready for the day. 
I'm trying to limit the ""cortisol effects"" by making sure I drink a bunch of water before I'm allowed a coffee and even ditching the dairy and putting in a scoop of milk flavoured (plant) protein powder instead. I'm not sure if either of these things actually help but I'd like to think theyre better for your hormones than just going straight caffeine on an empty stomach. 

I've given up so much to get things under control, but I can't give up my coffee . 

Does anyone have an alternative they've done, like switching tokw caffeine tea? Or ways to make the cortisol spike less *spikey* ? Or are we all just kind of doing the ""lactose intolerant but refuses to give up cheese"" thing? ",3,1757305901.0,PCOS,4,1.0,False

1nbeaam,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nbeaam,An odd assortment of Woolies and Aussie things in a supermarket in Malaysia,"These were taken in a middle-/upper-class grocery store in Malaysia near my home. They carry Woolies products and also import a lot of other Aussie products. There is another supermarket that carries Coles (no Aldi, unfortunately). 

There is a large demand for Aussie products here, especially among the middle class folks. They are quite pricey by local standards, but the fact that they kept restocking and bringing in new items meant that there is a fair dinkum demand for Woolies goods here. 

I always pop by for these Woolies coffee capsules. Coffee capsules are expensive here, they cost on average 60-70 cents apiece (in Australian dollars). These Woolies capsules sell for about 55 cents apiece here (in Australia they cost 45 cents apiece). A lot of Singaporeans on daytrips across the border buy them too, because a coffee capsule can easily cost 90 cents or more than a dollar in Singapore! 

I also buy a lot of these Oaty Slices. They are also a bargain compared to more locally well-known brands such as Carman's. 

The most popular snack is actually salt & vinegar chips. They stock the NZ version of Woolies S&V chips and they get sold out real fast. S&V isn't a local flavour so if you want S&V chips, you can only buy the ones imported from Australia. 

The tunas are popular too! We don't have single-serve cans here and they only come in either oil or water. These Woolies (and Coles) single-serve cannned tunas with different flavours are so popular that our local brands started making single-serve ones in different flavours. They cost $2.50 each so are considered quite pricey. ",29,1757305599.0,australian,18,0.97,False
1nbe894,https://i.redd.it/q72npw36bvnf1.png,[iOS] Inkwell - Private Micro-Journaling [$29.99 lifetime → FREE for 48 hours],"Hey everyone,

I'm the developer of Inkwell, a micro journaling app I built because I wanted somewhere to write daily thoughts without creating another account or trusting another company with personal reflections.

**What makes it different:**

* Works completely offline - no internet required
* Your entries stay on your device (optional iCloud sync through your personal account)
* Built for quick, micro-journaling throughout the day
* No accounts, no analytics, no company servers
* Search through years of entries, all processed locally on your device
* Home screen widget - start writing with one tap

I'm giving away the lifetime pro access for free for the next 48 hours (normally $29.99 one-time purchase).

**How to participate:** Just download the app from the link below and select the lifetime option for $0.00

**What I'm hoping for:** Honest feedback about the app - what works, what doesn't, what you'd like to see. And if you find it useful, a review on the App Store would truly mean a lot. I'm a solo developer and every review helps others discover the app.

The app is designed for people who value simplicity and privacy. It's not trying to revolutionize journaling - it's just a clean, simple space to write that actually stays private.

1nbe75h,https://i.redd.it/qxea2yqwavnf1.png,🤑 Post Office Hack: How I'm Building 11 Lakh with Just ₹222/Day (Govt Guaranteed!),"Just discovered this amazing Post Office RD scheme that literally anyone can use to become a lakhpati!

The Math is Simple:

Save ₹222 daily = ₹6,660 monthly

6.7% annual interest (compounded quarterly)

Result: ₹11.37 lakh in 10 years! 💰

Why This Beats Other Options:
✅ Government guaranteed safety
✅ Start with just ₹100/month
✅ Get loan facility (50% of deposit after 1 year)
✅ Flexible withdrawal after 3 years
✅ No market risk like stocks/MFs

My Strategy:
Instead of spending ₹222 on random stuff daily, I'm putting it in this RD. That's like skipping one coffee shop visit or cutting down on unnecessary purchases.

For young Indians starting their financial journey, this seems like a solid foundation before exploring riskier investments.

## What is Bondi Bitspire?

**Bondi Bitspire** is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users trade various financial assets like cryptocurrencies, forex, and stocks using AI-driven algorithms. Think of it like a smart assistant that does the heavy lifting for you—analyzing real-time market data, spotting trends, and executing trades based on your preferences.

The platform claims to cater to both beginners and experienced traders. For newbies, it offers a user-friendly interface and automated trading bots. For the more seasoned crowd, there are customizable settings and advanced analytics tools to fine-tune strategies. It reminds me a lot of platforms like **Bitcoin Era** or **Immediate Edge**, which also gained traction for their auto-trading features.

## Who Created Bondi Bitspire?

This is where things get a little vague, which is pretty typical for platforms in this space. The creators of **Bondi Bitspire** haven’t gone public with their identities, but from what I’ve gathered, it appears to be developed by a team of financial analysts and software developers with experience in algorithmic trading.

While a lack of transparency might raise eyebrows, it’s not unusual in the crypto world. Other successful platforms like **Bitcoin Code** also launched without a famous founder. What matters more is how the platform performs and whether it delivers on its promises. Based on my experience so far, Bondi Bitspire seems to be built by folks who know what they’re doing.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Bondi Bitspire Today](https://tinyurl.com/2a2kg5f3)
## How Does Bondi Bitspire Work?

Bondi Bitspire uses **AI-driven algorithms** to scan live financial markets for patterns, indicators, and price movements. When it detects a potentially profitable trade, it executes the trade automatically or alerts the user, depending on the settings. 

Here's a simplified breakdown of its workflow:

- The AI scans the market 24/7.
- It uses historical data and technical indicators to predict market trends.
- When a signal matches your chosen criteria, it either trades on your behalf or sends a notification.
- You can set trading limits, stop losses, and custom strategies.

The cool thing is you don’t need to stare at charts all day. You can go about your life while the bot does the legwork. But it’s also not a “set it and forget it” kind of tool—monitoring performance and tweaking settings occasionally is still important.

## Bondi Bitspire Pros and Cons

Let’s be real—no platform is perfect. Here’s the good and the not-so-good from what I’ve experienced:

### ✅ Pros

- **User-friendly interface** even for total beginners
- **Automated trading** saves time and effort
- **Real-time analytics** help you stay ahead of market trends
- **Supports multiple asset classes**, not just crypto
- **Demo mode** to test strategies risk-free
- **Fast withdrawals** (within 24–48 hours in my case)

### ❌ Cons

- **Lack of transparency** about the creators
- **Minimum deposit of $250** might be high for casual users
- **No mobile app**, relies on mobile browser interface
- **Limited educational resources** for new traders

So yeah, it’s got some room to grow, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons for most users.

- **Desktop computers** (Windows, macOS)
- **Tablets**
- **Smartphones** (Android, iOS via browser)

## Bondi Bitspire – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The platform’s **real-time analytics engine** is constantly scanning the markets. This is one of the tools that gives Bondi Bitspire an edge, especially for users who want to capitalize on short-term price movements. I found the data to be up-to-date and relevant, which is crucial in fast-moving markets like crypto.

### User-Friendly Interface

The interface is **clean, simple, and intuitive**. You won’t get lost in a sea of charts and buttons. It’s easy to navigate whether you’re a first-time user or someone with trading experience. The onboarding process is smooth, and the dashboard gives you all the key info at a glance.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even though there’s no app, the browser version works great on mobile. I was able to monitor trades, check my balance, and tweak settings right from my phone while waiting for coffee. It’s not perfect, but it gets the job done.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **price alerts, trade notifications, and risk controls**. This feature is a lifesaver if you want to keep tabs on market movements without being glued to your screen. I set up alerts for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and they came through without a hitch.

This gives you more flexibility and diversification, which is always a smart move in volatile markets.

## Is Bondi Bitspire a Scam?

This question comes up a lot, and it’s totally fair. From what I’ve seen, **Bondi Bitspire is not a scam**. It functions as advertised, processes withdrawals, and provides real-time trading tools. 

That said, like all trading platforms, it **doesn’t guarantee profits**. If someone tells you it’ll make you rich overnight, they’re selling you dreams. It’s a tool—not a magic wand. Use it wisely, and you can definitely benefit. But don’t go in expecting miracles.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Bondi Bitspire?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is pretty standard for platforms in this space. It’s enough to get started without risking too much, but it may still feel steep if you're just testing the waters. 

Good news is, once you deposit, you can access all features, including demo mode and live trading. No hidden fees so far in my experience.

### Bondi Bitspire Customer Support

I tested their **24/7 customer support**, and it was surprisingly responsive. I got a live chat reply within 2 minutes, and email responses within a few hours. Whether you’ve got account issues or just questions, they seem to have a decent support team in place.

## How do you start trading on Bondi Bitspire?

Starting on Bondi Bitspire is super straightforward. Here’s how I did it:

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to their site and fill out the short registration form—name, email, phone number. Took me under 2 minutes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll get redirected to a partnered broker platform. Deposit the **$250 minimum** via credit/debit card, wire transfer, or crypto. Verification was quick—just uploaded my ID and a utility bill.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once funded, you can either switch to **demo mode** or go live. I recommend testing strategies in demo first. Once you’re comfortable, turn on the auto-trader and let the algorithm do its thing.

## How to Delete a Bondi Bitspire Account?

Deleting your account isn’t instant, but it’s doable. Just contact customer support via live chat or email and request deletion. You’ll need to verify your identity, and it’ll be closed within 24–48 hours.

**Bondi Bitspire is a solid option** if you’re looking for an automated trading platform with real-time tools, multi-asset support, and a simple interface. It’s beginner-friendly but also has enough features to satisfy more experienced traders.

It’s not perfect—I'd love to see a proper mobile app and more transparency about its creators. But overall, the platform delivers on its core promises.

If you’ve got **$250 to experiment with**, Bondi Bitspire is worth a shot. Just don’t put your life savings into it, and remember: trading always comes with risks.
