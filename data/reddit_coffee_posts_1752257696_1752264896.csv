This lets them innovate in ways traditional banks can‚Äôt‚Äîlike their genius RoundUps program:

How It Works:

\[\] Every purchase made with your Koho card rounds up to the nearest dollar.

\[\] The ""spare change"" (e.g., $4.30 coffee ‚Üí $0.70 roundup) goes into a Rewards Pocket.

\[\] Koho matches 0.5% of these roundups as cashback.

Why It‚Äôs Clever:

\[\] Psychological Hack: RoundUps feel painless (micro-savings), but add up fast. Koho‚Äôs match incentivizes consistent spending through them.

\[\] Regulatory Edge: As a prepaid card, Koho avoids complex banking rules‚Äîletting them deploy features like this instantly.

\[\] Sticky Loyalty: Users check the app daily to watch rewards grow. It‚Äôs gamified finance.

‚öôÔ∏è Behind the Scenes: How Koho Funds Your Perks

Koho‚Äôs free model relies on interchange fees (cut from Visa transactions) and premium subscriptions (e.g., Koho Cobalt at $14.99/month):

* Cobalt perks: 2% cashback on food/drink, 5% savings interest, free international ATMs.
* They monetize data anonymously too, tracking spending trends to improve products.
* üöÄ Growth Hack: The ""Early Payroll"" Trap
* Koho‚Äôs payroll advance (get paid 3 days early) is a masterful retention tool:
* Users link direct deposit ‚Üí Koho becomes their financial ""home base"".
* Early access feels like a lifeline (even if psychological).

1lxh2yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lxh2yq/aio_that_my_friend_got_into_med_school_at_my/,AIO that my friend got into med school at my expense?,"My best friend and I (both 23) have been friends for over a decade now. I've been having some issues with here lately more than ever and I keep thinking about all the things in our relationship that I have never felt comfortable with. I have to mention that I've been thinking for a few years now that she's a narcissist, like, actual textbook narcissist and not as an insult, so keep that in mind while reading. The thing I'm referring to happened three years ago already, and it's still sitting with me. My friend and I are both in our 3rd year of university, different fields, different universities. We both got into our dream schools and are really good at what we're doing so there's absolutely no element of jealousy here on my behalf. When my friend was trying to get into med school she nailed the tests almost effortlessly. She's truly the smartest person I've ever encountered, but she's not the most empathetic, and that's a problem when getting into med school, at least in my country, because they have specific personality tests which include personal essays and interviews to see if you're capable of empathy and tolerance etc. Basically they're trying to see if you can actually dedicate your life to help other people because it's a huge commitment. To be honest, nobody thought that my friend will pass this test on the first try, she herself confessed to me a bunch of times that she thinks she's incapable of empathy (which is one of the reasons why I suspect her for being a narcissist). She was super worried that she won't pass the test because of she doesn't, she has to wait another whole year to take it again. She was looking all over the place for stories from her past whenever she helped other people and I'm dead serious when I say that she doesn't have almost any.
About a year before that, I went through the most horrible time of my life, I had to sent a guy to jail for something he did to me, you can assume the details which I don't really wanna share rn. My best friend was summoned to testify to the police because she had some information I shared with her from what happened that night. She really didn't have to do much, just show up and have a little conversation with the investigators, and I'm not saying that it's not overwhelming, but it was kinda much more overwhelming for me lol. Instead of sucking it up and doing her best to help me she made everything about her. She called me the night before the testimony (it was during COVID so we couldn't meet up) and bowled her eyes out crying over the phone that she doesn't wanna do it. She didn't really have a choice and had to go there once she was summoned by the investigators so I just tried my best to calm her down and help her prepare mentally. It was literally the worst time of my life and I was the one comforting her. She even called me the day after and told me that it was so chill with the investigators, they gave her coffee and she just gossiped with the girlies basically, and she even shared things that were completely irresponsible of her to share and it caused so many issues later.
Nevermind whatever the hell happened back then, the real problem was that she decided that she was going to use this story to make herself look kind and empathetic for her med school interviews. A few days before her interview she came up to me and begged me to let her use this story because ""this is her only way to get into med school and this is her dream"". But she wanted to change the frickin story and make it seem like she fully supported me during those rough times and was the best friend ever for me while I was debating on self-terminating myself lol. She begged me to let her lie on her test about what a great friend she was for me back then and she basically didn't give me an option to say no, because her career was on the line. I just wanted her to stop bringing all of it up so I said ""yes"" and immediately regretted it. The day after her interview she was so thrilled when she told me how the interview was super mid until she brought up my story, and suddenly the interviewers absolutely LOVED her for everything she did for me. I wanted to tell her how she made me feel so used but I honestly couldn't, she couldn't stop talking about herself and I just assumed that I'll never be able to tell her and ruin this successful interview for her. Three years later, she's in med school, about to get her first degree, and I know that she deserves it, she's brilliant, she worked so hard for this. She deserves every bit of academic credit, but I cannot shake the fact that she wouldn't have even gotten there if it weren't for lying about what she did for me. We've been having some issues lately, I feel like I cannot call her my best friend anymore and I hate it because we've known each other for most of our lives, I love her like a sister, but she makes me feel so awful everytime we talk.",1,1752264726.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

I just feel lost.,"Could also just be a personal dream/fantasy not to persue. Also worried I might end up switching out for mental health reasons.

Kinda just had a realization for the 2nd or third time that what I ACTUALLY want to do is to do ecology research on something really specific in some other country(I saw a youtube video of someone who did this exact thing). And just write research papers on specific organisms and research those.

Thats a career path but its a really narrow one and one I can persue easily even if I stick with engineering(perhaps easier even).

Was considering switching to ecology but with an engineering degree and maybe a minor in ecology or something thats still viable and all. I've always had some level of interest in ecology and certain branches of it but I know I want to stick with engineering. Not 100% sure where this is coming from. (Aside from the fact that other than engineering I've always been really passionate in ecology, conservation, certain branches of various fields and would 100% want to incorporate it with my civil engineering degree. )

Its not completely new... just I don't think its a viable option to switch out.

\+ I partially don't want to drop engineering since I don't want to be part of some statistical ""oh look women drop engineering cause they're bad at it/men are naturally better at math"" bs I've heard several times throught my life(and suggested as a reason to switch out of engineering. So I'm 100% not switching out.) Yeah I failed some math and engineering courses but it was cause I had a bad professor and my mental health was really bad.

 blame not working out enough. I nearly ruined my gpa. Thought my issues were cause I was struggling to focus, and it was... but I  had a bunch of mental health issues kinda start to flame up alongside everything else, didn't realize till now (not taking any courses) but I wasn't really processing anything in my surroundings. (Felt slow but didn't tie it into my mental health, didn't fully realize how badly I was processing everything.) Went to a therapist cause I had alot of paranoia, said i had psychosis symptoms which kinda went away for now.. but those issues came and went and returned before so 0 guarantee it won't happen again during higher moments of stress. (It was bad I thought thers were recording my thoughts and keeping tabs on me, not all at the same time... and I nearly got ready to ""run away"" a few times cause i thought my coffee was being drugged. Uh the level its gotten better to on its own is also like ""not hearing things and for the past few days I started working out really well and 0 paranoia + I feel very grounded"" This wasn't all at once it was like ""issue builds up.""

A thorough review awaits!,"The Mr. Coffee 2129927 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker has been a trusty addition to my daily coffee-making routine. With its sleek design and a feature-rich build, it‚Äôs clear the folks at Mr. Coffee put thought into creating an easy-to-use appliance. I decided to put every feature to the test, and the results were both satisfying and eye-opening.

**Design and Build Quality**

The product has a modern yet unassuming design that blends effortlessly into my kitchen. It‚Äôs compact for a 12-cup coffee maker, measuring 13.7 x 10.9 x 13.55 inches, and doesn‚Äôt hog counter space. Weighing just 4.18 pounds, moving it around is simple, though I typically leave it in one spot. The buttons on the front panel are intuitive, and the digital display is easy to read‚Äîeven before caffeine kicks in. However, the lightweight plastic construction felt slightly flimsy in places, especially the carafe handle. While it doesn‚Äôt feel like it would break with normal use, it‚Äôs something to note if you‚Äôre rough with appliances.

**Brewing Performance**

Brewing coffee with this machine is pretty straightforward. I love the Strong Brew Selector, which lets me make bolder coffee with the press of a button. This feature has come in handy for those mornings (or late afternoon slumps) when I crave a stronger boost of energy. The brewing process is quick too‚Äîless than 10 minutes for a full pot of coffee, which I found impressive for an appliance at this price point. The overall taste of the coffee is smooth and consistent, which speaks to the machine‚Äôs ability to strike a good balance between brewing speed and flavor extraction.

[Check Mr. Coffee 2129927 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c74vj5wf/)

**User-Friendly Features**

Programming the coffee maker the night before has become my favorite feature. Using the Brew Later function, I can set the timer, and waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee is now a daily luxury. The 4-hour auto-shutoff has saved me more times than I can count, as I‚Äôm notoriously forgetful about turning appliances off. Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause is another lifesaver‚ÄîI can pour myself a cup mid-cycle without creating a dripping mess. It‚Äôs like the machine gets my caffeine impatience! These features make it particularly ideal for busy households or forgetful coffee drinkers like myself.

**Good Aspects**

- Compact, modern design fits most kitchens without taking up too much room.  
- Programmable Brew Later function ensures coffee is ready when you need it.  
- Strong Brew Selector provides an option for bolder-tasting coffee.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The plastic construction, while lightweight, might not feel sturdy enough for heavy-handed use.  
- The carafe handle could benefit from better ergonomics.  

**Ease of Maintenance**

Cleaning up is a breeze. The Lift & Clean Filter Basket pops out easily, and both it and the carafe are dishwasher-safe. I haven‚Äôt encountered any issues with either part warping or staining, despite daily use. If you‚Äôve ever groaned at the thought of scrubbing a coffee pot, this design will save you a lot of time and hassle. One feature I think could improve the ease of maintenance further is a ‚Äúcleaning cycle‚Äù indicator, which is absent here. You‚Äôre left to keep track of deep cleanings on your own.

**Challengers**

Comparing this product to similarly priced competitors like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew or the Black+Decker 12-Cup Coffee Maker, several distinctions come to mind. The Hamilton Beach model offers both a single-serve and a full-pot brewing option, making it more flexible for varied users. However, it lacks the Strong Brew feature that I‚Äôve come to rely on for robust coffee. The Black+Decker option is more affordable but doesn‚Äôt include programmable settings like Brew Later, making it a less attractive buy for those relying on coffee schedules. If you‚Äôre more concerned with ease of programming and stronger coffee options, this Mr. Coffee model has a clear edge.

**True Value**

While it‚Äôs packed with helpful features, I wouldn‚Äôt call this the most premium coffee maker, but its price-to-quality ratio is impressive. The reusable coffee filter is a nice touch that saves both money and the planet. Though some competitors might offer additional gimmicks like thermal carafes or dual brewing modes, this product keeps things simple yet effective‚Äîa solid choice for anyone seeking functionality without blowing their budget.

1lxgojm,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1lxgojm/how_do_you_feel_when_you_dont_get_enough_sleep/,How do you feel when you don‚Äôt get enough sleep?,"A couple years ago I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. I got put on a cpap machine, but to this day I can‚Äôt get good sleep with it. Without it I sleep somewhat, but not a lot. When I was in high school I‚Äôd go some nights without getting a wink of sleep. Nowadays, I typically go to sleep around 10-11pm and after laying in bed and (hopefully) ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù I check my phone to see that it‚Äôs like 2-5am. My new neurologist can‚Äôt seem to grasp the concept that I‚Äôm still not sleeping. I‚Äôm on Lunesta and modafanil to help stay awake in the day and sleep at night. I can feel it physically and emotionally affecting me now. I barely eat (and still overweight) and I feel nauseous throughout the day. I feel like crying because I want to sleep, but I can‚Äôt. Like today I took my Modafanil AND drank a pretty strong cup of coffee and I‚Äôm still yawning and having droopy eyes and face, but for the life of me I can‚Äôt sleep. Again, I can feel myself getting depressed just thinking about it. I also have days where I get angry really easy. For example, if someone is chewing loudly I‚Äôll imagine a thousand ways of torturing them. Is this normal behavior? I was thinking of seeing another neurologist, but I‚Äôm not too sure. I‚Äôm sorry this post is all over the place, I just really needed to vent and express what I‚Äôm going through. Is there anyone that feels the same?",1,1752263773.0,sleep,1,1.0,False

1lxgjuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1lxgjuj/did_i_ruin_my_whole_career/,Did I ruin my whole career ?,"Well, this starts back in 2021, when I left MA as I wasn't much interested by 3 months and later joined a company but left that too in 7 months and joined a contractual job in 2022, worked there for two years, I wasn't on good terms with people there, I was recently told by my friend that people snitched on me and that's why they won't let me ever come back. I left that job in oct'24 and decided to go for mba, I was told by a lot of people to not leave my job but I did it because I was influenced by my then bf that mba will transform my life, later I realised that I actually don't want to go for it, sat home for 9 months, got cheated by the same guy üôÇ. 
 
Somehow I found a job and I was told that I'll be permanent with x company but I will need to work at client company Y. I had my training online, finally after a few weeks I went to the office for 4 days and I realised this role isn't for me as I was told that it's an onsite role but I didn't expect the work to be this crazy, I had to do a lot of climbing stairs, standing whole day, it's like an 11 hr physical work. They wouldn't even give me a chair to sit as they thought it won't look nice to pull a chair in a room full of training, they wouldn't let me complete my coffee if their coffee is completed,  they would ask me to leave it and work, when they themselves ask me to take a coffee if I need. I overshared to a colleague and probably he snitched too and on the 4th day I was asked that if I would continue here or not as this is the physical work and I need to make my mind, I was so overburdened, I said my whole body is paining,this is not L&D, this is office admin work, this is shit, the head and manager got angry and went away, eventually i discussed everything with company X as well. Meanwhile one of the managers comes to me tried to sweettalk me and i reaveled to her that I had a gap and now this 1 month experience, and who will hire me now, my life is spoiled, my career, my dream is ended. The manager snitched this to head and told her that I told my life is spoiled due to L&D( i never meant it this way).

I was called to submit my id and i apologised to them as I got rude but the head started talking as if I am asking her to take me back, I clarified that I am apologizing as i got rude, not because I want to work here as I was the first one to say that I don't want to. Everyone got up from their chair, told me how i talked something below the belt, i asked them to tell me what is it, they said that you said your life is ended due to L&D, I said that I never meant it this way, I said it in another way, that moment I realised how my words were twisted and presented to the head. I was told to leave and shown hand gestures, told that 'lets escort her out', 'madam ka aaj last day hai' , 'ghar jake sochna kya kra, aage jaha kaam kro aisa mat krna', I was begging them to not hold my docs or do anything legally, I was crying infront of 500 people, when they left me till the lift,  escorted me out , made me beg, I felt so helpless. 

I immediately called X company's manager and supervisor, ko told them everything, even the next day, I told them if they could hire me internally as I was ready to move to their location, but they didn't have any openings, i told them if this was a permanent role, I wouldn't have been harassed this bad or if the Y company's head was not a women, she wouldn't have the guts to throw me out like that as a male manager would be afraid to behave like this to a female employee but there are no law against her so she felt she could do anything to me. The X company asked me why I had mentioned that my career would be spoiled and eventually i would get married, I said that I need a job right now as I'm 24 and any parents would wait till 30, so I am free now to move but they thought that I'm doing a job to not get married, hence i clarified them that I'm ready to move but they said I need to put my papers as they have no openings. 

Also while I was conversing with Y company, they mentioned how they're doing this for 25 years, i mentioned that maybe I'm not cut for it but they took it on their ego and mentioned how a person has come all the way from Malaysia, they behaved as if I didn't exist in between these conversations, I felt so helpless in all those moments, the head is like the gossip queen and I worry, if she is going to blacklist me in other companies.
 
I know that I've been too expressive, I should have just gone home and sent a resignation but the way they harassed me isn't right either. They would have atleast done this drama in a enclosed space or maybe not if I wasn't a vendor to them. Now it's not just a gap but a 1 month of kala dhabha on my resume. 

Feel free to tell me where I'm wrong or where are they wrong or what can I do from here, I think I don't understand corporate rules, it's just me and my overthinking unemployed head nowü•≤ I keep thinking if I was wrong or their behaviour, how do I proceed with all this mess as I'm unable to process and move ahead with my job search.

1lxgeyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1lxgeyv/bisalp_surgery_update_july_7th/,BISALP Surgery Update ‚Äì July 7th,"
My surgery was scheduled for 9:00 AM on July 7th. In the days leading up to it, I was given some instructions: since I‚Äôm taking Metformin, the nurse told me I could take it until Sunday at midnight. However, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to take any medications like Advil starting from Thursday, July 3rd, through Sunday night. Between midnight and 6 AM on surgery day, I was allowed to have clear liquids like black coffee, Gatorade, or water...but after 7 AM, absolutely no liquids.

I arrived at the hospital around 6:30 AM and checked in by 7:00 AM. I waited in the surgery prep area until 8:00 AM, when a nurse brought me to a room to change and take a urine test. They asked me some final questions about my procedure and had me sign paperwork.

There was one nurse who kept repeating, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still young,‚Äù every chance she got üòÖ

The urine test took almost 30 minutes to process. Thankfully, the rest of the nurses were kind and funny, and when the results came back negative, we were all so relieved. (Technically, I was still spotting from my period.)

Once I got to the OR, I saw my anesthesiologist, my doctor, a resident, and more nurses. Then the lights went out and the next thing I knew, I was waking up in the recovery room. I was super dizzy and couldn‚Äôt keep my eyes open. I stayed there for another 30 minutes while they gave me anti-nausea meds.

While I was still half out of it in the recovery room, I overheard two nurses talking openly about how much they liked what‚Äôs going on with the new administration. Honestly, it was disappointing to hear...especially in a medical space where that kind of political talk shouldn‚Äôt be spoken out loud around patients.

As soon as I got home, I went straight to bed and was completely knocked out until around 4 PM. That‚Äôs when I finally got up and ate something.

Post-Op Recovery:

Day 2: The anesthesia had fully worn off, and the pain kicked in. I managed it with ibuprofen and hydrocodone, and I took Senexon to help with my bowel movement. But I pushed myself too much‚Äîwalking and moving around more than I should have....which led to heavy bleeding.

Day 3: I took it easy the entire day. I slept a lot, ate, and avoided too much movement. Thankfully, my bleeding completely stopped and I started feeling noticeably better.

Day 4 (Today): I still have a bit of soreness, but it‚Äôs way more manageable than the first two days. I‚Äôm not bleeding anymore, and I finally had a bowel movement (thanks to Senexon and Dulcolax). They did prescribe magnesium too, but honestly‚Ä¶ no thank you ü§¢. I‚Äôve been moving around lightly, but making sure not to overdo it.

I have my post-op appointment next week, where my doctor will show me the surgery photos and check how my incisions are healing.

1lxg88p,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1lxg88p/i_am_27_years_old_make_120000_live_in_north/,"I am 27 years old, make $120,000, live in North Carolina, work as a Clinical Research Associate, and I am almost done paying off my consumer debt!","SECTION ONE: ASSETS AND DEBTS

* Retirement Balance: $50,000
    * 401k: $47,000
    * Roth IRA: $3,000
* Savings Account Balance: $10,000 in HYSA
* Checking Account Balance: $1,100
* Credit Card Debt: $5,000 at 0% until October 2025
* Personal Loan: $1,375.55 to be paid in September 2025 at $475/month
* Student Loans: $0, paid it off this year!

I am very fortunate to land my current role at the beginning of this year making this salary allowing me to contribute $2,000/month. Prior to my current role, I was contributing between 5-10% of my salary to my 401k. I just started a Roth IRA this year and planning to max my contributions.

My savings fluctuated a lot over the past 5 years. It was a mix of having no financial understanding of emergency and long term savings and getting into credit card debt. It was a cycle of saving and pulling out money to pay off my credit card. I am now building my savings properly and learned from my mistakes in my early 20s.

Let‚Äôs get into my consumer debt, which I accumulated from 22-26 and at its height was $25,000. I finally faced my debts and bad financial habits in January 2024 and made a plan - two balance transfer cards for 0% interest, a personal loan, and stuck to a budget! For a while, most of my leftover money after paying bills went straight to my debts then after I made a huge dent, I slowly started building my savings again and actually left it alone. My debts were accumulated from all sorts of things - travel, experiences, random stuff, etc. I always said yes to everything and did not know how to manage my money. I grew up extremely poor and I was hungry a lot as a kid, so when I started working part time at 16 I felt that I should provide myself with everything that I missed out on. This was my mindset for a loooong time until it hit me that this is not sustainable and I need to practice delayed gratification and build a better foundation for my future self. I am very proud of myself now that I can comfortably say no to plans when it doesn‚Äôt fit my budget or if I have no available funds to allocate for it - instead I save towards bigger plans that I actually want to do like traveling and every time I say no to going out or a spontaneous weekend trip, I think of how sweet that 3 week international vacation will be when it‚Äôs all paid for.

I graduated with $20,000 of student loans for a bachelor‚Äôs which I think is decent. I was fortunate enough to have my tuition covered by a scholarship for all 4 years and I took out $5,000/year to help with daily expenses. I was completely independent in college and had no family support. At 18, I was responsible for my housing, health insurance, and all other bills. In order to not take out a lot of loans, I was working 2-3 part-time jobs at a time. You would think that having this experience would make me a lot more financially responsible after graduating, I wish it did lol.

At the moment, I just want to be completely debt free by consumer debt while aggressively saving in my retirement accounts, emergency fund, and soon a long-term fund for a downpayment. I have no interest in going back to school for another degree because frankly it is just so expensive.

SECTION TWO: INCOME

Income Progression: I have been working in my field for 5 years (since graduating) and I started at $20/hour which was roughly $41,000/year as a study coordinator.

After 1 year, I moved to a different site with better pay and benefits. I was making $62,000 as a study coordinator. During this time, I was researching what potential careers I can have in the industry. I learned more about different roles and functions and set a goal to become a CRA. 6 months into this role, I hopped to a new company and became a Clinical Trials Assistant at $70,000. In this role, I worked directly with CRAs and gained a lot of skills and knowledge.

After a year, I got my break to a CRA role making $80,000 at a different company. I stayed here for about 2 years and grinded a lot. There were lots of work travel and I was determined to keep moving up. Unfortunately, I did not receive any promotions or raises during this time despite being a high performer. I got tired of the empty promises and eventually left which brings me to my current role.

Now, I make $120,000 and I feel very fortunate. I am still in shock at my salary progression over the last 5 years.

Main Job Monthly Take Home:

I take home ~$5,700 a month after all deductions such as 401k contributions, taxes, and health insurance. My monthly deductions are as follows:

* 401k: $2000
* Health insurance (medical, dental, vision): $300
* Taxes: $1000

Any Other Monthly Income:

I travel a lot for work and get $75 per day for food (per diem) which is deposited to my account and if I don‚Äôt use it all, it‚Äôs cash in my pocket. I tend to get my meals at a grocery store like Whole Foods to try and be a bit healthy. Restaurant portions are also huge and I don‚Äôt usually finish it all so it ends up being thrown away. Additionally, if we drive our personal cars we get reimbursed for mileage at a standard rate of 0.70 cents/mile. I drive a 2016 Corolla that is low maintenance so if the drive is 4 hours or less, I opt to drive my car. Anything further than that, I fly which is covered by work. I don‚Äôt really like to count this as ‚Äúadditional‚Äù income and it just sits in my checking account when it comes in. If I were to estimate how much I pocket, it would be $300-600 per month depending on how much I traveled.

I live with my partner but we do not combine finances at the moment, something to revisit down the road!

SECTION THREE: EXPENSES

Here are my monthly expenses:

* Rent: $745 (my portion, split 50/50 with partner)
* Renter‚Äôs Insurance: $15
* Utilities: $100 (my portion, split 50/50 with partner)
* Phone: $50, I just pay for service as my phone is paid off
* Car Insurance: $136
* Gas: $50
* Car Maintenance: $150 which I put away in a sinking fund for any car related maintenance, yearly registration, etc. Luckily no car payment as I drive a 2016 Toyota that is paid off!
* Groceries: $150
* Dining Out: $200
* Nespresso: $50, this is my splurge! I usually buy pods every 3 months and I allocate $50/month for it
* Subscriptions: $74 which includes Amazon, Netflix, Spotify (I pay mine and my brother‚Äôs), Apple Care, iCloud
* Personal: $200 which is for beauty related items like wax, threading, buying skincare, manicure, and pedicure. 
* Medical: $10 for a prescription co-pay
* Fitness: $160 for a pilates studio membership, I usually go 3x/week
* Savings (HYSA): $500
* Roth IRA: $800, I increased this recently to hit the max limit of $7,000 by December 2025.
* Credit Card: $1,650 and will be done in October 2025!
* Personal Loan: $475 and my last payment is in September 2025 and I am looking forward to have more cash to save!
* TOTAL: $5,415

After all my expenses, I have about $285 leftover from my main income. It‚Äôs not a lot, but I don‚Äôt really spend anything on a day to day basis. Once my credit card and personal loan are paid off, I will have an additional $2,125 per month! I am planning on increasing my HYSA monthly contribution and starting a brokerage to invest.

MONEY DIARY

Monday:

I woke up at 5am to get my workouts in as today is a travel day.  I had my coffee while doing my morning sudoku then I got dressed. I went on a run with my partner then I went straight to my pilates class at 7am. I got home, showered, then finished packing. From 9am-11am, I was working at home and preparing for my visit. I head to the airport where I had my first meal of the day at the lounge and had some cheese, crackers, salad, and a weird chicken dish. It‚Äôs free so can‚Äôt complain! I landed at around 4pm, got the rental car, then drove to Whole Foods to get some meals for the next few days. The total comes out to $65.54, but I get per diem so no cost to me!

Day Total: +$9.46

Tuesday:
Woke up at 5am again to try and have a physical start to the day, but hotel gyms always feel eh. After a measly work out, I had scrambled eggs, toast, cereal, and banana for breakfast from the complimentary hotel breakfast bar. I got ready for the day and drove to my work site and worked there from 8:30am-4pm. It was very busy and I spent most the day scrambling to review a lot of data so tomorrow will be an easier day for me. I barely had a chance to eat my packed lunch from Whole Foods. After work, I drove to the city center and went on a walk to decompress and move around after sitting down for 8 hours. I went back to the hotel around 6pm and I heated up another Whole Foods meal in the microwave and had dinner. I did some more work in bed and passed out at around 10pm.

Day Total: +$75 (did not use my per diem)

Wednesday:
Same same as my Tuesday morning - work out, eat hotel breakfast, then drove to my work site. I was really stressing to get everything done because I have to leave the site by 3pm and head to the airport. Of course, I stayed later than expected and I was rushing. As soon as I dropped off the rental car, I was sprinting to get to the terminal. Busy afternoon and the security lines were long. I was saved once again by CLEAR (not an ad) and was able to bypass the lines. Made it to my gate as they called for final boarding, lucky. I got home at around 10pm due to delays with my connecting flight. I was so tired and passed out immediately.

Day Total: +$75 (did not use my per diem)

Thursday:
I tried to sleep in, but I woke up at 5am still. My partner and I went for a run and chatted about my work trip. Our morning runs is one of my favorite ways that we spend quality time together. Starting the day with each other is something I cherish. He made breakfast for us and we enjoyed it together. He left for the office at 8am and I cleaned up around the house before logging in at 8:30am. I work from home today and caught up on the emails that I was not able to get to while traveling and on-site. I decided to end my work day at 3:30pm and have an early afternoon after getting home late last night. I got a Kitchen Aid mixer as a birthday present, so I decided to put it to work. I made several cookie dough - chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, and matcha. When partner got home, he was so excited to see dozens of cookies I made since he‚Äôs been craving them. We ate the cookies while watching Gilmore Girls.

Day Total: $0

Friday:
I had an early morning pilates class at 6am today. After class, I decided to stop by the coffee shop by my apartment. They have these amazing breakfast biscuits and yummy coffees that I could not resist. It‚Äôs Friday so a little treat is not so bad! I got a sea salt caramel latte and country ham biscuit for myself and a mocha and sausage biscuit for my partner which came out to $26.87. My partner was very happy with the Friday treats and we decided to eat our breakfast in the patio. He left for the office and I was working from home again today. Just an admin day and prepping for another work trip next week. When my partner came home, we went on a nice afternoon walk. Having the sunlight until 8:30pm is so nice and I try to take advantage of the long summer days because I get so sad during the dark winter time.

Day Total: $26.87

Saturday:

My partner and I woke up at 7am to get ready for the run club which meets at 8:30am. We‚Äôre both new to North Carolina so we‚Äôre making an effort to put ourselves out there and meet new people. I know run clubs get made fun of, but I‚Äôve had such a positive experience so far! Being surrounded by people who have the same interests boosts my energy. After the 5k run, we hang around and chatted with our friends. We went home, showered, and both took a nap lol. We woke up at 12 noon sweating because it‚Äôs been so hot here lately with the heat wave. My partner and I started making our dinner, short rib ragu pasta. This was an all afternoon affair and we finished around 6pm and ate our yummy dinner. After dinner, we went to the movies to see the F1 movie. My partner bought us tickets for date night because he knows how much I love F1 (shout out Drive to Survive lol). I bought us a popcorn and soda to share ($16.50) and sunk into the comfy seats.

Day Total: $16.50

Sunday

Sunday was a busy, productive day. First, we watched the F1 race in the morning. Then, we went to Trader Joe‚Äôs to get our groceries for the week. Since I am traveling Monday-Wednesday again, we didn‚Äôt need to get a lot. The total came out to $74.48. I paid for this week‚Äôs grocery run since my boyfriend paid for last week‚Äôs. After our grocery run, we did chores around the house - our weekly cleaning, laundry, etc. I also packed for my work trip since I leave tomorrow. My partner and I went for a walk before making dinner. We spent Sunday evening lounging and solving a puzzle. It was a nice end to the week before I prepare for another week ahead.

Day Total: $74.84

Weekly Total:
* Expenses: $118.21
    * Groceries: $78.84
    * Eating out: $43.37
* Per Diem Surplus: +$159.46

December 20th, 2012
It is Thursday. There‚Äôs dried blood under my fingernails. I just killed a man. Now I wait for the 
sirens to take me away and dissolve all that was left of the old me. I watch myself put down the 
knife and lay myself against the cold cement of this ground that was meant to be tiled with Italian 
marble. The damn Italian marble. We almost had it all. 
Chapter 1


March 6th, 2011
I look around the room. There‚Äôs not that many people in here. I see the receptionist- a lady that 
couldn‚Äôt have been as old as she looked with a cigarette between her wrinkly grubby fingers, 
coughing on the smoke that she blew out of her own mouth- a man wearing an olive shirt with 
brown stripes on it who had few hairs on his almost reflective head and looked like he had been 
there many more times than he‚Äôd like to pretend he hadn‚Äôt. I keep looking and I see a young 
woman wearing a red and black pinstriped dress with puff sleeves, a woman holding the hand of 
a little boy looking barely eight years old. As my eyes wander the contents and corners of this 
room, it makes me wonder if there was ever any passion or care that filled it. Sure, I know passion 
dies slowly, love fades to obligation, care is chiseled over and over again to reveal it‚Äôs true core of 
self-helplessness. I‚Äôm not pessimistic, I swear. I just seem it. Rainy days make me feel safe. I 
sometimes cry to sad movies and call it a cathartic experience . I take long drives to make myself 
feel okay. I feel my face go hot and my stomach sink every time a pretty boy with a sensible smile 
looks at me in the subway (okay this probably makes me a very easy target but let‚Äôs pretend we 
didn‚Äôt realise that).
 So what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I feel happiness. It‚Äôs just that I feel despair more deeply. Like it‚Äôs 
a part of something way more fundamental to my existence. It comes to me like lightning on a 
stormy day. As I roll all these thoughts between the two beads of my ring, I can‚Äôt help but feel a 
little happy. As if all my issues make me better than everyone else because who else can feel so 
deeply? Who else can think of such complicated things? Paradoxically they also scare me to my 
grave. What kind of an egoistic narcissist gives herself so much credit and importance? I then 
hate myself. I am not an idiot I can recognise the pattern. I can see what needs to be straightened 
and what needs to be plucked and thrown off a cliff into non-existence. 
Then why am I here at therapy at 9 in the morning when I should be at work so i can pay for my 
future and all the shiny things I want to fill it with you ask? It is court-mandated. Everyone thinks I 
need therapy just because I did exactly what my aunt asked me to. Don‚Äôt let her die in a boring 
gray hospital. Well I actually failed at that because she did in fact die at a boring gray hospital but 
I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to let her corpse rot away in an ice box among many others. It felt wrong. 
So I did what I had to. I stole her body, let it rest in my trunk for two whole days while I drove to 
Mexico. That is where on a bright sunny day, sometime after the sun bowed down, I burned her. I 
took some of her ashes to keep on my coffee table in a vase so she can watch Days of our lives 
for all eternity with me. Just the way she liked. Anyway the cops found out and long story short I 
wasn‚Äôt charged because my lawyer had claimed I was mentally unstable as I was ‚Äúovercome with 
grief‚Äù and long story short here we are.
My aunt was my last family. She had raised me from the age of 5 till I suppose last Christmas 
which is when she left me which also happens to be the day after my 23rd birthday. What 
happened to my parents you ask? Well my dad‚Äôs name is a mystery and my mom shot-
‚ÄúDana Freeman?‚Äù A voice shakes me out of my thoughts.
I enter the therapist‚Äôs room and I am greeted by Dr. Penelope Sickle. I hate her
‚ÄúTake a seat Dana.‚Äù And so I oblige.
‚ÄúHow have you been since our last visit? I hope your cat isn‚Äôt still sick‚Äù she tries to make light-
hearted conversation and references my last excuse to cancel our appointment. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, thanks.‚Äù I answer shortly. 
‚ÄúDo you want to pick up where we left off last time?‚Äù She asks, to my dismay.
‚ÄúAre you gonna let me leave if I said no?‚Äù I let out a small laugh out of not wanting to seem like a 
total prick. She laughs a little too before saying,‚ÄúYou know the answer to that. So how about we do something different today? I want you to tell 
me an incident from your childhood when you were really happy.‚Äù
I exhale and begin to think. I hate doing things exactly as people say. It makes me feel exposed 
and threatened. Somehow it‚Äôs also one of the things I‚Äôm excellent at. For some reason I can‚Äôt 
seem to focus and think of anything. I‚Äôve had a relatively happy childhood. Why can‚Äôt I think of 
anything? I just start speaking in the hopes that something will eventually come to me.
‚Äú This one time when I was in elementary school, my aunt and I went to the one of those local 
amusement parks where almost every ride was a safety hazard and the ice cream always gave 
you a sore throat. It was not ideal but we could afford it. Despite all, we had a great time. We went 
on the overhead cabin ride that went across a lake even though we were both terrified of heights. 
We held hands and started panicking. My aunt was sweating and cursing and crying and 
shrieking. I was dead silent and looked straight ahead and waited for the cabin to get closer and 
closer to the little wheel at the end. When it ended, my aunt screamed with joy and lifted me off
the ground and spun us around. It was the only time she had ever done that.‚Äù
Dr. Sickle smiles at me before asking
‚ÄúWhy do you think you were so silent? I mean you said you were terrified. Then why didn‚Äôt you 
say something?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Maybe because I didn‚Äôt want to freak my aunt out any further?‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you guessing?‚Äù
‚ÄúDefinitely‚Äù
She laughs and continues to ask me 
‚ÄúDo you think maybe that is the reason why you feel the need to suppress your emotions, 
because you don‚Äôt want to escalate a situation that you can‚Äôt control or maybe it‚Äôs because you 
feel like a burden whenever you express any sort of emotion?‚Äù
I stare at her for a few moments. Now you know why I hate her.
‚ÄúI had never thought of it that way.‚Äù

I‚Äôm 22F and he‚Äôs 21M, been together for 2 years now. He doesn‚Äôt know that I know about him cheating, I had that gut feeling the other night and within 2 minutes of looking through his phone; convos with girls he met @ bars, trying to get ahold of his ex, writing songs about his ex LOADS of porn which he said he had not watched in over a year (lol) to name a few. 

Aside from anything else, it‚Äôs worth noting how pathetic his attempts at cheating or getting his ex‚Äôs attention are. He relentlessly told me that his ex was a serial cheater, like making out with guys in his face. Then started claiming that she had left a note on his car, she called him multiple times, asking to get coffee etc. All things that make me wanna go nuts on her‚Ä¶ He said that he would handle it and preferred that I didn‚Äôt get involved, so I respected it and left it at that. Fast forward to two days ago, I got her number and reached out, she said that she hasn‚Äôt reached out in over two years and that HE was the one that ruined the relationship with HIS lies and deception. Absolutely pathetic. 

He also took me to the airport about a month ago, almost a 3-hour drive so I offered for us to drive my car, it was waaaaay cheaper on gas. After he dropped me off, it was a traffic shit show, so he asked if I minded that he stops at his aunts house. I saw not a single thing wrong with it; I knew his aunt and exactly where she lived (Long Beach, Ca) , I thought nothing of it and I was busy getting through the airport so what he was doing was none of my concern. When I went through his phone, I saw a number with the Long Beach area code and a photo of some chick. He GASLIT, apparently she was just some old number that he had deleted that came out of the woodworks to say hello (?). Because I‚Äôm not the complete idiot he thinks I am, I obviously called her too, and she gave me all the details. He ended up at a bar ALONE, asked for her number kicked it all night and then messaged with her and god knows who else for the entirety of my trip (10 days) Then, I guess they talked until the day I came home, his excuse for ending his conversation with her was that he ‚Äúgot back together with his ex‚Äù üëèüëç

So, the past two years have been a lie because this man clearly still has a thing for his ex and any other woman that isn‚Äôt his girlfriend who‚Äôs currently carrying his kid.

The morning I saw the positive result on the pregnancy test, I felt like it was going to be okay and that he had my back, like I FELT it. He was understanding, sweet and helpful and expressed a HUGE desire to be a dad which I found sweet and of course my hormonal mind wants hearts stars rainbows and roses. He‚Äôs talking about baby shower themes, a name for the baby, how he‚Äôd do everything to provide for me and a child etc. all the while, he‚Äôs doing what he‚Äôs doing. I found out exactly a week ago, so I‚Äôm still figuring out how I even feel, let alone what the fuck to do with any of this. 

I can‚Äôt talk about this with anyone in my family. I can‚Äôt trust anyone to not guilt me, shame me, persuade me etc. Terminating the pregnancy would be INCREDIBLY difficult physically regardless of which route I would take but the mental toll of holding this man‚Äôs child is sickening, I won‚Äôt ever get those messages and things out of my head.

knife and lay myself against the cold cement of this ground that was meant to be tiled with Italian 
marble. The damn Italian marble. We almost had it all. 
Chapter 1


March 6th, 2011
I look around the room. There‚Äôs not that many people in here. I see the receptionist- a lady that 
couldn‚Äôt have been as old as she looked with a cigarette between her wrinkly grubby fingers, 
coughing on the smoke that she blew out of her own mouth- a man wearing an olive shirt with 
brown stripes on it who had few hairs on his almost reflective head and looked like he had been 
there many more times than he‚Äôd like to pretend he hadn‚Äôt. I keep looking and I see a young 
woman wearing a red and black pinstriped dress with puff sleeves, a woman holding the hand of 
a little boy looking barely eight years old. As my eyes wander the contents and corners of this 
room, it makes me wonder if there was ever any passion or care that filled it. Sure, I know passion 
dies slowly, love fades to obligation, care is chiseled over and over again to reveal it‚Äôs true core of 
self-helplessness. I‚Äôm not pessimistic, I swear. I just seem it. Rainy days make me feel safe. I 
sometimes cry to sad movies and call it a cathartic experience . I take long drives to make myself 
feel okay. I feel my face go hot and my stomach sink every time a pretty boy with a sensible smile 
looks at me in the subway (okay this probably makes me a very easy target but let‚Äôs pretend we 
didn‚Äôt realise that).
 So what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I feel happiness. It‚Äôs just that I feel despair more deeply. Like it‚Äôs 
a part of something way more fundamental to my existence. It comes to me like lightning on a 
stormy day. As I roll all these thoughts between the two beads of my ring, I can‚Äôt help but feel a 
little happy. As if all my issues make me better than everyone else because who else can feel so 
deeply? Who else can think of such complicated things? Paradoxically they also scare me to my 
grave. What kind of an egoistic narcissist gives herself so much credit and importance? I then 
hate myself. I am not an idiot I can recognise the pattern. I can see what needs to be straightened 
and what needs to be plucked and thrown off a cliff into non-existence. 
Then why am I here at therapy at 9 in the morning when I should be at work so i can pay for my 
future and all the shiny things I want to fill it with you ask? It is court-mandated. Everyone thinks I 
need therapy just because I did exactly what my aunt asked me to. Don‚Äôt let her die in a boring 
gray hospital. Well I actually failed at that because she did in fact die at a boring gray hospital but 
I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to let her corpse rot away in an ice box among many others. It felt wrong. 
So I did what I had to. I stole her body, let it rest in my trunk for two whole days while I drove to 
Mexico. That is where on a bright sunny day, sometime after the sun bowed down, I burned her. I 
took some of her ashes to keep on my coffee table in a vase so she can watch Days of our lives 
for all eternity with me. Just the way she liked. Anyway the cops found out and long story short I 
wasn‚Äôt charged because my lawyer had claimed I was mentally unstable as I was ‚Äúovercome with 
grief‚Äù and long story short here we are.
My aunt was my last family. She had raised me from the age of 5 till I suppose last Christmas 
which is when she left me which also happens to be the day after my 23rd birthday. What 
happened to my parents you ask? Well my dad‚Äôs name is a mystery and my mom shot-
‚ÄúDana Freeman?‚Äù A voice shakes me out of my thoughts.
I enter the therapist‚Äôs room and I am greeted by Dr. Penelope Sickle. I hate her
‚ÄúTake a seat Dana.‚Äù And so I oblige.
‚ÄúHow have you been since our last visit? I hope your cat isn‚Äôt still sick‚Äù she tries to make light-
hearted conversation and references my last excuse to cancel our appointment. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, thanks.‚Äù I answer shortly. 
‚ÄúDo you want to pick up where we left off last time?‚Äù She asks, to my dismay.
‚ÄúAre you gonna let me leave if I said no?‚Äù I let out a small laugh out of not wanting to seem like a 
total prick. She laughs a little too before saying,‚ÄúYou know the answer to that. So how about we do something different today? I want you to tell 
me an incident from your childhood when you were really happy.‚Äù
I exhale and begin to think. I hate doing things exactly as people say. It makes me feel exposed 
and threatened. Somehow it‚Äôs also one of the things I‚Äôm excellent at. For some reason I can‚Äôt 
seem to focus and think of anything. I‚Äôve had a relatively happy childhood. Why can‚Äôt I think of 
anything? I just start speaking in the hopes that something will eventually come to me.
‚Äú This one time when I was in elementary school, my aunt and I went to the one of those local 
amusement parks where almost every ride was a safety hazard and the ice cream always gave 
you a sore throat. It was not ideal but we could afford it. Despite all, we had a great time. We went 
on the overhead cabin ride that went across a lake even though we were both terrified of heights. 
We held hands and started panicking. My aunt was sweating and cursing and crying and 
shrieking. I was dead silent and looked straight ahead and waited for the cabin to get closer and 
closer to the little wheel at the end. When it ended, my aunt screamed with joy and lifted me off
the ground and spun us around. It was the only time she had ever done that.‚Äù
Dr. Sickle smiles at me before asking
‚ÄúWhy do you think you were so silent? I mean you said you were terrified. Then why didn‚Äôt you 
say something?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Maybe because I didn‚Äôt want to freak my aunt out any further?‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you guessing?‚Äù
‚ÄúDefinitely‚Äù
She laughs and continues to ask me 
‚ÄúDo you think maybe that is the reason why you feel the need to suppress your emotions, 
because you don‚Äôt want to escalate a situation that you can‚Äôt control or maybe it‚Äôs because you 
feel like a burden whenever you express any sort of emotion?‚Äù
I stare at her for a few moments. Now you know why I hate her.
‚ÄúI had never thought of it that way.‚Äù

It's too bright. It's too loud. I just need to get back to my car and go home where I can mix this into a proper Irish coffee.

 There's a commotion in front of the local dive up ahead. I didn't know it even opened this early. I prefer to drink at home, I prefer peace and quiet. 

 A man, sloppy drunk and barely able to stand, is yelling and being half carried half dragged by a cabbie and a bartender to an old painted up crown vic, illegally parked.
 I'm irritated, they're blocking the walkway, as he begins spewing vomit in all directions. I pause, and crush out my cigarette into the ashtray near the door. The smell of decades of spilled beer, cigarettes, and a hint of cheap perfume wafts out. Why is the jukebox so loud this early? ""Radioactive...Radioactive"" I hate this song.
A wave of nausea comes over me. 

The cabbie leans the man against a nearby palm tree,  and pats his own pockets down for the keys as he walks around to the driver's side.
I lock eyes with the drunk, and he angrily slurs something at me. Something probably offensive, I think I heard him call me a bitch.

 Whatever. I don't take criticism from men with pee pee pants.

I light another cigarette, ""Get it together, man."" I say like the judgemental bitch I am.

The man staggers towards me, stops, and mumbles something as he's pointing in my face.  He suddenly looses his balance and tips backwards and with a sickening thunk, his head hits the concrete and his arms shoot out straight up.
The cabbie turn around, sighs, and grabs the man by his hands and drags him awkwardly into the car as his eyes roll back and he gurgles.

The smell of his sour vomit, that ""THUNK"" sound, all the rum & cokes I had the night before and the black coffee are just too much.

My turn to puke everywhere.

 I aim for the gutter at least.


The sound of his head hitting the ground echos in my mind though. I know deep in my lizard brain that man was not okay.  

It's years later now and I've forgotten all about these things.
I'm feeding my chickens a cantaloupe and just for fun, I try to see how high I can toss it. As it slams into the ground , I'm suddenly overcome with nausea and I puke. 
The chickens rush to eat that too. 

Jesus Christ.

I go inside to fix a drink, and I deeply wish I still smoked cigarettes. 
I don't believe in ghosts, but this man is definitely haunting me. 
I can't stop hearing the cracking of his skull, so I turn on the radio in the kitchen, and I turn the volume up til the sound in my own head is drowned out. 
It's still goddamn Imagine Dragons.

I know that sounds super boring, but let‚Äôs break it down. Our feet have taken a LOT of action over the years. You've probably been trotting around in heels, working out in less than supportive shoes, or just doing your best to keep up with daily life. Here‚Äôs what you might have been doing all this time: 

- **Wearing the wrong shoes:** Remember that pair of cute shoes that looked amazing but felt like torture? Yeah, it might be time to reconsider your decisions!
  
- **Ignoring pain signals:** Oh, the classic ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a little twinge.‚Äù Spoiler alert: it may not just be a little twinge if it keeps showing up!

- **Not staying active:** Yes, I said it! A sedentary lifestyle can lead to stiff joints and weaker muscles. Your feet need some love too!

- **Overdoing it:** Whether it's gardening, hiking, or even just standing too long while in line for coffee, our feet can only take so much!

But hey, here‚Äôs where it gets exciting! **‚ÄúHelping People Walk, Run, Jump Pain-Free‚Äù** isn‚Äôt just a catchy phrase; it‚Äôs a goal we can all get behind! If you‚Äôre ready to give those feet a break, consider checking out some great resources!

I got off the quitting kratom reddit because after a few months i felt like i over did it and was just sick of talking about kratom. But then i relapsed. Im trying to get support for myself but im also so frustrated. Every time 30 is spent on 7-Oh its not spent on me saving for a car all the things i need.

At times, frustrating but I'm actually appreciating the science involved in pulling shots. It lead me to thinking about my first introduction to espresso and how it all started for me. 

I dove into more full time espresso drinking when my first child was born. Long days, far too many sleepless nights at work and at home required the high test caffeine instead of regular coffee. I got tired of preparing a regular cup of coffee up to 6 times a day so I reluctantly rolled into the nearby Starbucks (I know, I know) and it was all down hill from there.

1lxfxao,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lxfxao/we_called_her_showtime_then_came_the_screaming/,We called her ‚ÄúShowtime‚Äù - then came the screaming.,"Well, there‚Äôs this mysterious older lady, like in her 60s, that lives across the street in my neighborhood. I forget if she‚Äôs either ex-Amish or Mennonite. I don‚Äôt remember. And all my life, she would always walk around my neighborhood in her high heels and her dress with her bright red hair and also hold a coffee mug while walking. Also, cherry red lipstick too. But she would sort of walk funny. The legs and feet were crooked and apart (it‚Äôs hard to explain it in text). My family would always call her showtime lol. But then, like a couple of years ago, she sort of stopped walking around the neighborhood, but the weirdest thing happened was her screaming! I‚Äôm not joking about her screaming; I‚Äôm always outside (as every kid should be) and across the street. I hear this yapping, gibberish screaming noise coming from her house. 
Also, every house in the neighborhood has some characteristics/personality like different decorations , flowers, all of that stuff, but not her. She has no decorations at all. It‚Äôs just very perfectly, uncanny, bland. Her blinds were always shut, so I could never see what the inside looked like. The only time she ever decorates is Halloween -since that‚Äôs her favorite holiday. 
So anyway, no one believed me when I said I think ‚ÄúShowtime‚Äù is screaming. After many months of convincing everyone around , they noticed her screaming too. One day I went up to her neighbor (who, funny enough, is an actual Mennonite), and she too always noticed her screaming. She told me that she went up to ‚ÄúShowtime‚Äù one day to tell her to be quiet. But the craziest thing was ‚ÄúShowtime‚Äù said to the neighbor that it wasn‚Äôt her who made the screaming- it was the tv! And we both agreed that was a load of baloney. 

As I said, she doesn‚Äôt walk anymore, but once in a random blue moon, she‚Äôll go up to certain people‚Äôs houses with cookies. And according to them, she‚Äôs very nice. 

But besides that, all she does outside is to cut her grass - all the time‚Ä¶in her dress and heels! 
And idk if she‚Äôs autistic or what, but she‚Äôs super crazy about sweeping the sidewalk perfectly clean, like sometimes every day. 

Oh, the weirder part is her driving. She drives an old red Ford sedan, but she‚Äôs very peppy/jerky with her driving. It‚Äôs like she has both feet on the gas/brake. Also, she leans to the side‚Äîsorta under the dash‚Äî when she drives. Idk if she also has a back problem, but that‚Äôs gotta be dangerous if she runs into something. I would not wanna be her driver at all.  

Now her screaming sometimes happens every day or not at all for a while until recently she did it again‚Ä¶.outside‚Ä¶in public‚Ä¶.
So that confirms that she is the screamer after all. But she was doing something with her lawnmower in the driveway‚Äîlike something was broken‚Äî and she starts whacking it with her infamous sidewalk broom! I‚Äôm not joking and dead serious‚Äînot exaggerating! It looked like something straight from a cartoon. Well, I guess she literally is ‚Äúshow time‚Äù after all !! 

Now I‚Äôll admit, it was pretty funny at first, but now I‚Äôm slightly concerned. I wonder if she has anger issues or she‚Äôs getting attacked by the devil or something more serious. 

Edit: This is a real story‚Äîunlike these other stories on this subreddit.

Testing out the OXO 8710100 Brew 9 Cup Coffee Maker over several weeks has been an interesting experience, and I‚Äôve brewed countless pots of coffee with it. This machine quickly became part of my morning ritual. With its sleek silver and black stainless steel design, it looks both modern and professional on my kitchen countertop. While its features promised top-notch coffee-making precision, a few aspects gave me pause, which I‚Äôll dive into below.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
I can't help but admire its sturdy and polished exterior. The double-wall stainless steel thermal carafe feels substantial, and the silver combined with black accents fits beautifully in any kitchen. The clean, minimalist form is particularly pleasing, blending seamlessly with other stainless steel appliances. The backlit LED display and single dial interface make operation straightforward‚Äînot an overwhelming array of knobs and buttons, thank goodness! Its compact design manages to balance visual appeal with practicality, making it an asset to small or large kitchen spaces.  

[Check OXO 8710100 Brew Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00yeykk8u/)  

**Performance and Brewing Precision**  
Brewing coffee with this machine felt like being in a caf√©‚Äîonly it‚Äôs my home with pajamas still on. Thanks to the BetterBrew Precision Brewing, every pot I made maintained consistent water temperature (between 197.6¬∞F-204.8¬∞F) and evenly extracted flavor. It brewed flawlessly for both a full nine-cup pot and a smaller two-cup batch. The ‚ÄúRainmaker‚Äù shower head deserves a special mention for dispersing water so uniformly over the coffee grounds; I genuinely feel it made a difference in richness. One issue, however, is that brewing takes a bit longer compared to some other drip machines, which might bother anyone impatient for their caffeine fix.  

**Ease of Use for Different Users**  
The programmable functionality ensures this machine works for early risers like me who need coffee ready upon waking. Setting the automatic wake-up timer took less than a minute, and the instructions provided are simple enough that even my technophobic neighbor managed to set it up without help. Kudos to OXO for the internal mixing tube inside the carafe‚Äîit ensures every sip tastes consistently good, whether you pour in the morning or later. That maintenance timer is a delightful touch, although adjusting settings to your preference might take trial and error the first few days.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Consistent brewing temperature ideal for great coffee.  
- Automatic wake-up timer makes mornings easier.  
- Minimalist, elegant design fits any kitchen.  
- Internal mixing tube eliminates weak last sips.  

**Attention to Details and Comfort**  
This coffee maker feels smarter than your average appliance. Living with simplicity doesn't mean sacrificing function, as its ""pause and pour"" feature rescued me mid-mornings when urgent emails couldn‚Äôt wait for the brewing to finish. The thermal carafe keeps coffee piping hot for hours, but pouring coffee from it can be slightly awkward due to the angle of its spout. While minor, I feel that detail could be better refined.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Longer brew time than some machines.  
- Carafe design makes pouring a bit clunky.  
- Price point might be restrictive for budget buyers.  

**Competing Brands and Market Rivals**  
I compared this coffee maker to the Technivorm Moccamaster and the Breville Precision Brewer. Where the OXO excels is its automatic settings‚Äîit‚Äôs less intimidating with fewer customization options, which is really all I needed for hassle-free drip coffee. On the downside, the Breville offers more brewing variations and settings while also heating up faster. The Technivorm stands out with its extremely durable build quality and quicker brew time, but it doesn't have programmable features like the OXO. For someone who prioritizes simplicity and SCA-certified brews, this machine holds its own; however, performance junkies might gravitate toward those alternatives.  

**Price Worthiness**  
Considering the features packed into this machine, the price might feel fair to most coffee enthusiasts who appreciate the precision and quality. The investment leans more toward coffee aficionados who care about every step of the process, though casual drinkers might think twice given there are simpler and cheaper drip machines. The thermal carafe, precise heating technology, and SCA certification make it a worthwhile contender for anyone upgrading their gear.

I kept detailed notes of every meal and grocery run, so these numbers are real-world examples from March 2024.

For context, I traveled with my partner and we tried a mix of restaurants, food trucks, and cooking our own meals. Here's the breakdown:

Groceries: $180
We shopped at Foodland and Target for breakfast items, snacks, and ingredients for a few simple dinners. Prices were about 30-40% higher than mainland US. A gallon of milk was $7.99, and a loaf of bread was $6.50.

Restaurants: $460
Average dinner for two at mid-range restaurants: $80-100
Local plate lunches: $15-20 per person
Higher-end restaurants: $150-200 for two

Coffee/Snacks: $120
Daily coffee runs and afternoon shave ice added up quickly. Local coffee shops charge $5-7 for a basic latte.

Total for one week (2 people): $760

Money-Saving Tips I Discovered:
- Shop at Costco near the airport when you land
- Food trucks offer great value (especially in Paia)
- Many hotels have kitchenettes
- Local markets have cheaper produce than tourist areas

The biggest surprise was finding incredible value in guided tours that include meals. During our Road to Hana tour [https://athometouch.com/Maui], lunch was included - a fantastic farm-to-table experience that would've cost $50+ per person if purchased separately. The tour also provided snacks and drinks throughout the day, making it an unexpected way to save on food costs while experiencing Maui's best sights.

Quick Restaurant Recommendations:
- Breakfast: Kihei Caffe ($12-15 per person)
- Lunch: Coconut's Fish Cafe ($15-20 per person)
- Dinner: Monkeypod Kitchen ($30-40 per person)

Local Markets:
- Foodland (moderate prices)
- Times Supermarket (slightly cheaper)
- Mana Foods in Paia (organic options)

Remember that prices vary significantly between tourist areas and local spots. Wailea and Lahaina tend to be more expensive, while Kihei and Kahului offer better values.

One last tip: book activities that include meals when possible. Many snorkel trips include breakfast and lunch, and some luaus offer unlimited food and drinks for a fixed price. These can be better values than paying for separate meals.

If you're planning a Maui trip and want to combine sightseeing with included meals, check out the Road to Hana tour I mentioned. It really helped us save on food costs while experiencing the island's beauty.

Eveything looked brand new and it came with all the accessories. I have had zero problems with the machine. I generally make two lattes in the morning and one or two in the afternoon.

I got an 18 g vst basket and it has worked great. I was finding the 21 g basket too big and 14 g too small. It is ridgeless and works fine but is a bit tight in the machine. 

I landed on the vs6 after contemplating between the mazzer philos and niche zero. The night went up significantly in price due to tariffs and the mazzer was still $400-$500 more than the varia.

Then they slowly build the colour up, and it looks smooth. When I try, however, it's either so opaque that there's very little transition, or so thin that the paint accumulates at the edges like a coffee stain.

Also, is it always better to glaze light down to dark, or can you just as easily glaze loght colours over dark. I'm working on a black armour colour scheme that's basically spot highlights with white over black using an airbrush, then a full dark turquoise ink all over. I want to do a sort of khaki/ivory extreme highlight, but I'm struggling to blend those in. Working back in the turquise ink makes it appear way too green, so I'm hoping to be able to glaze with the highlight rather than the turquoise, but the ivory colour is where I seem to get the coffee staining.

Each time I'd come across their prescence it was like..like air disappeared. My breathing stopped..my heart slowed..and suddenly..it was just us. Nothing else mattered. I tried to forget..I tried letting it go. I would talk casually, give tasks that had no meaning to me at all, even get cold and distant simply for the hell of it. Then.. something changed. The tasks..it became ritualistic to give. The talks no longer casual now it was me, blatantly running someone's life..telling them what they should and shouldn't do..listening to their hopes and dreams, encouraging every last one..heh..and as for the money. Oh the money.. I could've been a mortgage bill the way I was getting sent their money. It became like routine.

1lxfopd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1lxfopd/how_to_make_patio_furniture_out_of_pallets/,How to make patio furniture out of pallets?,"Hey everyone! I've been getting really into DIY projects lately, and I wanted to share my experience making some awesome patio furniture out of pallets. It's a great way to upcycle and save money while creating a unique outdoor space.

First things first, you'll need to source some pallets. I got mine for free from a local hardware store - just ask around and you'll be surprised how many places are happy to give them away. Make sure to choose pallets that are in good condition and haven't been treated with chemicals.

Once you've got your pallets, it's time to get creative! I started by making a simple bench. Here's what I did:

1. Cleaned the pallets thoroughly
2. Sanded down any rough spots
3. Cut one pallet in half for the seat
4. Used another pallet for the backrest
5. Attached everything together with screws and brackets
6. Added some cushions for comfort

It turned out pretty great, if I do say so myself! The whole process took me about a weekend, and now I have a unique piece of furniture that didn't break the bank.

If you're feeling more ambitious, you can try making a coffee table or even a sectional sofa. There are tons of tutorials online that can guide you through the process step-by-step.

One thing to keep in mind is that pallet furniture can be a bit rustic-looking. If that's not your style, you might want to consider other options. I actually found some great deals on more polished patio sets here: https://athometouch.com/patio-furniture-set. They have a wide range of styles that might better suit your taste.

But if you're up for a challenge and don't mind a bit of a weathered look, pallet furniture can be a fun project. Here are a few tips I learned along the way:

- Always wear gloves and safety glasses when working with pallets
- Use a pry bar to carefully remove nails from the pallets
- Apply a weatherproof sealant to protect your furniture from the elements
- Get creative with paint or stain to customize your pieces

The best part about making your own patio furniture is that you can tailor it to fit your space perfectly. Whether you have a tiny balcony or a sprawling backyard, you can create pieces that work for you.

Of course, if DIY isn't your thing or you're short on time, there's no shame in buying ready-made furniture. Like I mentioned earlier, I found some great options at https://athometouch.com/patio-furniture-set. They have everything from simple bistro sets to luxurious outdoor sofas.

At the end of the day, what matters most is that you create an outdoor space you love. Whether that's through DIY projects or store-bought pieces, the goal is to have a patio where you can relax and enjoy the fresh air.

Has anyone else tried making pallet furniture? I'd love to hear about your experiences or see pictures of what you've created!",1,1752261349.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

1lxfo3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lxfo3o/i_saw_something_strange_while_watching_the_love/,I Saw Something Strange While Watching The Love Of My Life,"She has black hair and blue eyes. She is 5,6. She lives in a third story apartment above a little coffee shop. Every Saturday morning, she goes down to the shop and gets a cappuccino with extra whipped cream and a sausage egg sandwich, then walks to a nearby park and sits on a bench with her meal and a book. She is the most beautiful woman in the world. I know all of this and much more about her, but she knows very little about me. 

We‚Äôve only actually spoken three times:

The first time was on that first day I saw her sitting on that bench. I immediately knew that she was perfect, she was breathtakingly beautiful but there was something else too, something that I can‚Äôt explain, which told me that we were meant to be together. Naturally I approached her to ask her out. I had spent a good ten minutes figuring out what I was going to say, but standing in front of her the words just wouldn't come out. So I just stood there until she asked if I needed something. I said no and then escaped from the situation, now understanding that before I could task her out I would have to prepare.¬†

The second time was a mistake, it happened about a month into the process of getting to know her. For the previous two Sauturdays I was content to watch from the safety of a cluster of trees, they concealed me well but unfortunately her bench was too far away for me to fully appreciate her. So that third day I got greedy. I went to the park at 7:30 (her average arrival time is 8:02) and found a thick patch of tall bushes right by the bench. I crawled into them and did what I thought was an acceptable job concealing myself. 

The half an hour of thorns rubbing against my skin wasn‚Äôt pleasant but it was all worth it when she arrived. Being allowed to stare at her upclose, without fear of discovery, was the greatest experience I had ever had up until that point. At least it was until she saw me. She started screaming and asking what I was doing, I just stammered something about birdwatching and ran away. Even then I knew this was only a minor setback, the only thing that really hurt was that she didn‚Äôt seem to remember me from a month ago but I also knew that I had to be patient. It actually worked out pretty well because the idea of bird watching inspired me to purchase binoculars which allowed me to combine the best of both the trees and bushes.

The third time was while I was installing the camera. 

I had to disguise myself as a technician and go to her door right before she left for her Saturday walk. I deeply regretted missing our time together but it was the only way to be sure she wouldn‚Äôt be watching while I ‚Äúworked on some electrical issues‚Äù. She let me in without a question, I didn‚Äôt even have to use half the cover story I prepared. If I was forced to name one flaw about her it would be that she was too trusting. Once I was in I concealed the camera between two photos on her mantel, from that spot the device could see almost all of her apartment: Her living room, her kitchen/dining area, the door to her bathroom, and the door to her bedroom. 

I had actually considered putting the camera in her bedroom but decided not to because 1. It would be an invasion of her privacy, and 2. I am not a pervert.

I know some people would consider what I did wrong. Even I had second thoughts as I was about to leave. But then I thought about why I was doing this: It was an act of pure, unwavering, selfless love. I put that camera in her apartment because I wanted to have the ability to, at any point in my week, take out my phone and see the woman I love. What's so wrong about that? What's so evil about caring for someone so deeply that you just want to passively, harmlessly observe them as they live their life? If she didn‚Äôt know that I was watching then it couldn‚Äôt possibly have hurt her, and it definitely helped me, especially for those awful Saturdays when she couldn‚Äôt make it out to the park.

It wasn‚Äôt like she‚Äôd never know either. I planned to tell her once we had been married for a few years, then we could both laugh it off. 

That wonderful day when we could be together and laugh with each other without all the secrecy was coming soon. I could feel it. One Saturday I would wake up and just know that today I would do what I failed to do years ago and ask her out. I would first hide all of the photos and other artifacts which pertained to her (just like I do every month for my brother's ‚Äúcheck ins‚Äù) just in case we went back to my place after our date. Not that I would expect that of course, I like to think of myself as a very patient person.

Today was unfortunately not that day, but a Saturday was the next best thing. Even if the grass was wet and the sky was gray like they were today, it was still the highlight of my week. The camera was useful but granny, low frame-rate footage couldn‚Äôt compare to really being near her. She was there as always, sitting on her bench reading some trashy romance novel. I always wondered why she read those when I knew she was more than capable of reading more advanced literature.

You could tell she didn‚Äôt even like them that much even if she read them every Saturday, the same way you could tell she was lonely even if she went out with friends a lot. You can tell a lot about someone when you know them as well as I knew her. I think I knew her better than she knew herself.

I was thinking about how her friends would probably try and interfere with our relationship out of jealousy once we got together when I got a notification on my phone. It was a motion alert from my camera. I hadn‚Äôt gotten that notification while she was out since her cat Rufus died (his loss was a terrible blow for both of us) and so I was naturally concerned. ‚ÄúWhat if it was a burglar?‚Äù I thought uneasily, knowing then that I would have to find some way of telling her without ruining things between us.

Even with the best camera in the world it would have been hard to see anything with the lights off and sun blocked by the clouds. You could make out parts of the kitchen and living room that were near windows, but as your eyes moved deeper into the room the light became weaker until you could barely see anything at all. But through the dark I saw a figure standing in the doorway between the bedroom and the rest of the house. A figure with pale skin and blue eyes and black hair. It was her. It was impossible but it was her. She wasn‚Äôt moving, you could barely tell if she was breathing, but she stood there, and it was her.

Could she have had a twin this whole time? But why would she keep that a secret? I looked up to the woman on the park bench in front of me. At the woman with black hair, blue eyes, and pale skin. At the woman with the same book she‚Äôd read at this park for the past four weeks. At the woman now standing up from her bench and walking towards the apartment where she already was. I felt the urge to throw up.

I wanted to run from my hiding spot and tell her not to go to that building but what could I have said? There was nothing I could have done but I still felt awful and afraid as she exited the park. I looked back to my phone to see if maybe it was playing old footage somehow, but when I did I noticed that the figure was gone. The figure was gone and the bedroom door was now closed.

It usually takes her an about 2 minutes and 39 seconds to get home from the park. I don‚Äôt think today was much of an exception, but it felt so much longer. I just sat there: staring, waiting, looking for any sign of movement from the bedroom. Then she opened the front door and walked in. She took out her laptop and sat down at the kitchen table. I realized just how bad the frame rate was as I watched:

*She was typing.*

*Still typing.*

*She looked up like she heard something.*

*She looked around.*

*She sat back.*

*Did the door just open a crack?*

*She went back to typing.*

*The door was halfway open.*

*She didn‚Äôt notice.*

*Something lunged out of the darkness of the bedroom like an animal. It was her.*

*There was a struggle.*

*I lost track of which one is which.*

*One grabbed a kitchen knife.*

There was too much blood and I had to look away. 

Maybe it was all some sick, unfunny joke. Maybe she knew about my feelings and got the wrong idea. Maybe when I looked back, her and her stunt double or however that was, would be laughing. I turned to the camera ready for¬† the gore and blood, I wasn‚Äôt ready to see her staring straight at the camera. Straight at me. I never thought those beautiful eyes could make me afraid.

When she left the apartment she took the camera with her. It shook and bobbed up and down as she walked. I just sat there watching as she walked. Then when she‚Äôd made it to the end of her block and made the left turn that she made so many times before, I knew where she was going.¬†

So I ran. I ran and I felt my feet and chest and lungs beg me to stop, but I couldn‚Äôt. I never looked down at my phone, maybe it was the real her who won the fight. For all I knew she had just gone back to her bench, but I would be able to check once I was home. The three flights of stairs were almost worse than the twenty minutes of running, I almost tripped twice having to stabilize myself on the rough brick walls, and my hands were almost too sweaty to unlock my door, but I made it.

I flung myself onto my bed and wrapped myself in covers like a child afraid of the dark. I stayed like that until I remembered to check my phone. When I did, those blue eyes greeted me once again. The way she stared was strange, cold, like she wasn't alive, but I knew she was because she would blink every once and while. Seeing her like this was frightening, but it wasn‚Äôt the thing that would fill me with the kind of dread so great it was the only feeling that came close to matching the intensity of the love I felt for her. That came a second or two later when I saw, in a sliver of the screen not consumed by her face, part of an old brick wall. I knew where she was.

I waited for an incalculable amount of time. I was waiting to die. I was waiting to hear the crashes as my door buckled and gave way, to hear her thudding footsteps as she entered, to hear her scream or shout. But when sound finally came from outside, it was a soft:

‚ÄúHello.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond, but she knew I was there. So she talked to me. 

She told me that it was her, the real her. That she had killed her attacker and found the camera. That she realised who I was and how I was doing my best to watch over her. She called me her ‚ÄúGuardian angel‚Äù. She said she remembered me from all those years ago when I first approached her, that she waited for me in the park every Saturday since and only found me that one time in the bushes. She said she only screamed because she was surprised. She said she thought she recognized a technician who came by to work in her house, that when she saw the camera she put it all together.

She had almost lost everything and realized she was done waiting. She went out to the park and asked someone if they saw someone matching my description, they had and they pointed her in the right direction. She went from person to person this way and eventually she made it to me.

I still didn‚Äôt respond, but my hands were shaking, they are shaking as I type this. The only thing I have ever wanted might be right here in front of me.

She moved on from the facts of what happened a while ago. Now she‚Äôs talking about herself. She says her family doesn‚Äôt visit very often and they don‚Äôt really care about her. She says she‚Äôs never had any friends. She‚Äôs lonely. She‚Äôs lost. The only times she doesn't feel lost is when she thinks about us.

I know there's a chance that the girl outside means me harm, but I‚Äôve had time to think for the first time since I saw what I saw in her apartment. Either the love of my life, the light at the end of my weeks, the only thing that makes the days on my calendar mean more than numbers on a sheet of paper, is gone forever, or right outside my door. 

So as either one first or one last act of love: I think I am going to let her in.",7,1752261314.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

a little boy looking barely eight years old. As my eyes wander the contents and corners of this 
room, it makes me wonder if there was ever any passion or care that filled it. Sure, I know passion 
dies slowly, love fades to obligation, care is chiseled over and over again to reveal it‚Äôs true core of 
self-helplessness. I‚Äôm not pessimistic, I swear. I just seem it. Rainy days make me feel safe. I 
sometimes cry to sad movies and call it a cathartic experience . I take long drives to make myself 
feel okay. I feel my face go hot and my stomach sink every time a pretty boy with a sensible smile 
looks at me in the subway (okay this probably makes me a very easy target but let‚Äôs pretend we 
didn‚Äôt realise that).
 So what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I feel happiness. It‚Äôs just that I feel despair more deeply. Like it‚Äôs 
a part of something way more fundamental to my existence. It comes to me like lightning on a 
stormy day. As I roll all these thoughts between the two beads of my ring, I can‚Äôt help but feel a 
little happy. As if all my issues make me better than everyone else because who else can feel so 
deeply? Who else can think of such complicated things? Paradoxically they also scare me to my 
grave. What kind of an egoistic narcissist gives herself so much credit and importance? I then 
hate myself. I am not an idiot I can recognise the pattern. I can see what needs to be straightened 
and what needs to be plucked and thrown off a cliff into non-existence. 
Then why am I here at therapy at 9 in the morning when I should be at work so i can pay for my 
future and all the shiny things I want to fill it with you ask? It is court-mandated. Everyone thinks I 
need therapy just because I did exactly what my aunt asked me to. Don‚Äôt let her die in a boring 
gray hospital. Well I actually failed at that because she did in fact die at a boring gray hospital but 
I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to let her corpse rot away in an ice box among many others. It felt wrong. 
So I did what I had to. I stole her body, let it rest in my trunk for two whole days while I drove to 
Mexico. That is where on a bright sunny day, sometime after the sun bowed down, I burned her. I 
took some of her ashes to keep on my coffee table in a vase so she can watch Days of our lives 
for all eternity with me. Just the way she liked. Anyway the cops found out and long story short I 
wasn‚Äôt charged because my lawyer had claimed I was mentally unstable as I was ‚Äúovercome with 
grief‚Äù and long story short here we are.
My aunt was my last family. She had raised me from the age of 5 till I suppose last Christmas 
which is when she left me which also happens to be the day after my 23rd birthday. What 
happened to my parents you ask? Well my dad‚Äôs name is a mystery and my mom shot-
‚ÄúDana Freeman?‚Äù A voice shakes me out of my thoughts.
I enter the therapist‚Äôs room and I am greeted by Dr. Penelope Sickle. I hate her
‚ÄúTake a seat Dana.‚Äù And so I oblige.
‚ÄúHow have you been since our last visit? I hope your cat isn‚Äôt still sick‚Äù she tries to make light-
hearted conversation and references my last excuse to cancel our appointment. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, thanks.‚Äù I answer shortly. 
‚ÄúDo you want to pick up where we left off last time?‚Äù She asks, to my dismay.
‚ÄúAre you gonna let me leave if I said no?‚Äù I let out a small laugh out of not wanting to seem like a 
total prick. She laughs a little too before saying,‚ÄúYou know the answer to that. So how about we do something different today? I want you to tell 
me an incident from your childhood when you were really happy.‚Äù
I exhale and begin to think. I hate doing things exactly as people say. It makes me feel exposed 
and threatened. Somehow it‚Äôs also one of the things I‚Äôm excellent at. For some reason I can‚Äôt 
seem to focus and think of anything. I‚Äôve had a relatively happy childhood. Why can‚Äôt I think of 
anything? I just start speaking in the hopes that something will eventually come to me.
‚Äú This one time when I was in elementary school, my aunt and I went to the one of those local 
amusement parks where almost every ride was a safety hazard and the ice cream always gave 
you a sore throat. It was not ideal but we could afford it. Despite all, we had a great time. We went 
on the overhead cabin ride that went across a lake even though we were both terrified of heights. 
We held hands and started panicking. My aunt was sweating and cursing and crying and 
shrieking. I was dead silent and looked straight ahead and waited for the cabin to get closer and 
closer to the little wheel at the end. When it ended, my aunt screamed with joy and lifted me off
the ground and spun us around. It was the only time she had ever done that.‚Äù
Dr. Sickle smiles at me before asking
‚ÄúWhy do you think you were so silent? I mean you said you were terrified. Then why didn‚Äôt you 
say something?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Maybe because I didn‚Äôt want to freak my aunt out any further?‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you guessing?‚Äù
‚ÄúDefinitely‚Äù
She laughs and continues to ask me 
‚ÄúDo you think maybe that is the reason why you feel the need to suppress your emotions, 
because you don‚Äôt want to escalate a situation that you can‚Äôt control or maybe it‚Äôs because you 
feel like a burden whenever you express any sort of emotion?‚Äù
I stare at her for a few moments. Now you know why I hate her.
‚ÄúI had never thought of it that way.‚Äù

I drink milk based lattes over the weekend via my espresso machine, and pourover during the week from my Hario switch + MHW-3BOMBER Rain Splitter.

The DF83 is incredibly difficult to switch back and forth between grind sizes, so it's my dedicated grinder for espresso and I use the K6 as my current dedicated grinder for pourover. Besides, I don't prefer the taste from DF83 for pourovers anyway.

I usually roast light or light-medium bright coffees from African or Central American origins. Rarely I'll go even all the way to medium roast, and never to dark. I like the fruit forward and high acidity upfront and prefer thinner body cups. I also rarely if ever brew more than 20g dose, so I'm ok if the grinder capacity is as low as 20g.

I love the K6 and the bright cups I get from it. However I feel the body is too much, and I'm looking for a grinder that'll help me preserve the acidic flavors but brew the body with tea-like thinness - something that'll complement the K6 well. Budget is a constraint as I want you spend under $150 and don't mind if I have to buy a used grinder. I also think it's ok for it to be a hand grinder as grinding for pourover doesn't take very long (but electric grinder with be perfectly ok as well if I can find something in that budget).

The obvious choices that will come up are ZP6 and Pietro, however both are outside my budget and don't show up on used marketplace too often. The k-ultra is very similar to K6 and I view it more as a replacement than a complementary grinder. 

What other grinders besides ZP6 and Pietro fit the bill for what I'm looking for? ",1,1752260988.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

After years of blood, sweat, and coffee, my sag ultra low budget feature BitterSweet is finally streaming July 11 on Amazon Prime. It had a limited theatrical run last month, and now we‚Äôre seeing how it does in the wild west of streaming. 

If you‚Äôve ever sat there wondering if it‚Äôs possible to take your film from script to screen without a studio, the answer is YES, and it‚Äôs as chaotic, exhausting, and insanely rewarding as you imagine. My first Indie Film was back in 1999. My second was in 2009. But the Indie world is totally different now and it has been an eye opening experience. I thought festivals still mattered but they don't. So much money wasted on film freeway submissions could have been saved for marketing. 

If you‚Äôre curious about the process or pitfalls, ask away. Or if you want to support fellow indie filmmakers, here‚Äôs the link on Amazon Prime: 

Our cast and crew would love for you to check it out, leave a rating, and help us survive the algorithmic jungle of the streamers. üí™

Who else here has taken their indie film all the way to distribution? Any lessons learned?

In my early 20‚Äôs (now in my 40‚Äôs) broke up.   We will call her Beth. There‚Äôs a story. 

Beth and I dated for a few years. We were madly in love.  My family loved her. Her father loved me (her mom was an asshole then and still is). Everybody who knew us, felt we were made for each other.

Over the years we never lost touch with each other. We can‚Äôt see each other (we would when we were younger, made out but stopped there. Now, we have adult lives and know we‚Äôll probably end up cheating, but we‚Äôll chat now and then. She‚Äôs divorced and dating a dickwad. I‚Äôm married. Our convos are generally light - maybe some storytelling of the old days.  Always written not spoken.

If I needed a confidant outside of my wife, I could speak with her. My wife and I were having issues she helped me through.  She feels the same.

Beth and I have talked about our breakup. She says it was a terrible choice. Says she was going through selfish stage.  I told her it sent me spiraling. I hit the booze hard for about 2 years and went through failed relationships.  It was until I met my now wife that I got right.

If asked and I could be honest, Beth was the love that got away.  25 years later, she I think about her a lot.  I wonder how life would be. 

I never got real closure. She never said what went wrong.  Sexually we were fine. We were best friends.  In so many ways we were close. A few years ago, we were at an alumni event and did see each other for the first time in about 18 years. We chatted and grabbed coffee after before leaving.  We needed to stay in public because there was definitely tension. I asked her what happened. Her eyes said more than her.

I don‚Äôt know the point of this post is.  Not getting real closure is so hard. I wish she would‚Äôve said, I wanted to f**other tguys, I was cheating ‚Ä¶ you were annoying‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs been a bit of a bumpy ride so far but for the most part he‚Äôs been good for me. We have fallen so deeply in love and spend a lot of time together, even though I‚Äôm insecure I almost never doubt his love for me. He‚Äôs firm and kind with strong clear boundaries, he usually shows me love even when I‚Äôm spiraling. Even when we fight, we find a way to make up in the end. However he has a female friend (27) from work, she started there just a few weeks before he and I met and started dating. He and I had been dating a few weeks and joined a group setting of his coworkers. She ran up to him and hugged him, then looked at me with a look of surprise and disappointment when she saw we were together. It was just a split second but something felt off about that. Then throughout the event she told me repeatedly how beautiful my eyes are and how pretty I am. I thought it was a bit over the top but chose to not to think much of it. But in retrospect, I think maybe she had a bit of a work crush on him and this was a sad reality for her to see. Fast forward a few weeks, his cousin comes to visit and I wondered if I would be introduced to him, as I haven‚Äôt met any of his family yet. My boyfriend didn‚Äôt make any plans and I decided it wasn‚Äôt my place to sort that out, then he sent me photos of the 3 of them together at his lunch break. I was somehow more gutted than I thought I‚Äôd be that I wasn‚Äôt his first choice to meet his family. It struck a nerve because I was never welcomed into the family of my ex and it‚Äôs so important for me to feel like part of my boyfriend‚Äôs close circle of friends and family. He texted asking if I want to go eat in a few hours and I was devastated that the three of them made that plan before me. He still swears up and down it was just a matter of proximity, that ‚Äúof course‚Äù she was there because it was during work hours. It felt like I was the visitor or outsider. I really didn‚Äôt want to make a big deal but I ended up causing a huge fight over this. I told him it was over. We patched things up and every now and then when her name comes up, it causes a fight. I promised I would manage my traumas and insecurity but last week was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back, she finished her yoga session in his neighborhood and asked if he could meet for a coffee at his place. He‚Äôs very open about all of this constantly tries to reassure me and swears she is just a friend and always will be but something doesn‚Äôt sit right about her first thought after yoga to be to meet with him for coffee before work at his house. I personally think she‚Äôs a bit of a work for but he refuses to admit that when I bring it up. Anyway, short story long, today her name came up again regarding an upcoming work dinner they‚Äôll attend together and I lost my freakin mind, sent him so many nasty messages, deleted his number, I‚Äôm just so sick of this dynamic, I want her to go away and leave my boyfriend alone, having friends of the opposite gender is totally fine but I have a weird gut feeling or something like female intuition telling me that she‚Äôs pushing too hard to spend time with him. She‚Äôs also pushed hard to get the phone numbers of both his cousin and best friend to text with and potentially date, so I just feel like she‚Äôs digging herself deeper into their circle and we will be seeing more and more of her. Like maybe it‚Äôs just a morning coffee now but maybe next time it‚Äôs a late night glass of wine and then maybe a solo day trip somewhere and I‚Äôm supposed to just sit back and relax because she‚Äôs just a friend. I told him he has to make a choice but he said he won‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôm trying to backpedal now and asked him if he still wants to meet up this evening as planned. He hasn‚Äôt read or answered it and I, afraid that he won‚Äôt. On top of that, he‚Äôs already casually mentioned to his mum that I‚Äôm jealous sometimes, she didn‚Äôt respond negatively but I‚Äôm mortified. I can‚Äôt ask him to keep my toxic behavior a secret but I‚Äôm so embarrassed for people to find out I‚Äôm insecure and jealous

# Best 2500 Watt Power Inverter‚Äã 2025: Expert Review

the 2500 watt power inverter ‚Äåis a vital piece of equipment for anyone needing‚Äå to convert DC power from a‚Å¢ battery into AC power‚Å§ suitable ‚Å¢for running household‚Äã appliances, power tools, and electronics.It has become increasingly relevant for those‚Äç embracing off-grid living, remote work, camping, and emergency preparedness. This review will delve into ‚Äçthe features, ‚Å¢benefits, and potential drawbacks of top 2500-watt power inverters available in 2025, providing an‚Å§ expert perspective ‚Äãto guide your purchasing decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The market is flooded with power‚Äã inverters, ‚Å£but a few key features distinguish the ‚Å§best from the rest.

**Pure sine Wave Output:** A pure sine wave inverter produces an ‚Å¢AC waveform that closely mimics the power supplied by the electrical grid. This‚Å¢ is crucial for sensitive electronics like laptops, televisions, and some power tools that can be damaged‚Äç by modified sine wave‚Å§ inverters. Pure sine wave inverters ensure clean and stable power, promoting longevity and preventing ‚Å£malfunctions in connected devices.

**Multiple AC Outlets‚Å¢ and USB ‚ÄåPorts:** The availability of multiple AC outlets is essential for running‚Å¢ several‚Å¢ devices together.Look for inverters with‚Å¢ at‚Å§ least two, preferably three or more, AC outlets to accommodate‚Å£ diverse ‚Å¢power needs. In addition, integrated USB ports, particularly those with fast-charging capabilities (e.g.,USB-C),provide convenient options for charging mobile devices,tablets,and other USB-powered ‚Å§gadgets ‚Äçwithout needing additional adapters.

**Digital Display and Monitoring:** A clear ‚Äåand informative digital display enhances the‚Å§ user experience and provides valuable‚Å¢ real-time data. The ‚Äãdisplay should show input voltage (from the battery),‚Äã output voltage (AC), output wattage, and any error codes that may arise. This allows users to monitor the inverter's performance,diagnose potential issues,and optimize power consumption.‚Å¢ Some advanced models even include historical data logging for detailed‚Äå analysis.

**Thorough Protection Features:** Safety is paramount when dealing with high-power‚Äã inverters. The best ‚Å¢models ‚Å¢incorporate multiple ‚Å£protection features, including overload protection, over-voltage protection, under-voltage protection, short-circuit ‚Äãprotection, and‚Äã over-temperature protection. These safeguards prevent damage to both the inverter and connected devices, ensuring user safety and reliable ‚Äãoperation. Look ‚Å£for inverters that meet industry safety standards‚Å¢ and certifications.

**Efficient Cooling system:** ‚ÄãA 2500-watt‚Äå inverter generates considerable heat‚Å§ during operation. An efficient cooling system is essential‚Å£ for maintaining optimal performance and preventing overheating, which can lead ‚Å¢to reduced lifespan or ‚Å§shutdown of the inverter.High-quality inverters typically employ a ‚Äçcombination of heat sinks and thermostatically‚Äç controlled cooling fans that automatically adjust their ‚Å£speed based on the inverter's temperature.

Key features of a ‚Äçsuperior 2500 watt power inverter include:

 True sine wave output
 Multiple AC outlets and USB ‚Å§charging‚Å§ ports
 ‚Äå Digital display with voltage and wattage readouts
 Comprehensive protection against overload,over-voltage,and short circuits
* Efficient cooling system with temperature-controlled fan

## Core Benefits

The benefits of using‚Äç a high-quality 2500-watt power inverter are numerous and‚Å¢ cater to a variety ‚Å£of‚Äã users.**powering Essential appliances:** A 2500-watt inverter can effortlessly ‚Äçpower a wide‚Äå range of essential appliances, including refrigerators, microwaves, coffee makers,‚Å§ and small air conditioners. This makes it an invaluable tool for off-grid living, ‚Å¢camping, RV travel, and emergency situations where access to‚Å£ grid power is unavailable.‚Å¢ Having reliable AC power means maintaining a pleasant and functional lifestyle, even in remote ‚Äålocations.

**Versatility for Remote Work and Travel:** The rise of remote work has increased the demand for portable power‚Äå solutions. A 2500-watt ‚Å§inverter ‚Äãprovides the versatility‚Å£ to power laptops, monitors, printers, and ‚Äãother office equipment from a vehicle or off-grid power source. This‚Å£ empowers users to work productively ‚Å£from anywhere, whether it's a‚Äå campsite, a job site, or a remote cabin.‚Äã It greatly assists digital nomads and‚Å£ those seeking location independence.

**Enabling Mobile‚Äã Businesses:** For businesses operating out of‚Äå vehicles or remote‚Å§ locations, a 2500-watt inverter can be crucial.Carpenters, plumbers, electricians, and food vendors ‚Äãcan use it to power their tools,‚Å§ equipment, and point-of-sale systems.This enhances productivity,expands service offerings,and allows them to ‚Å¢conduct business in areas without grid power access.**Emergency Power ‚ÄåBackup:** In the ‚Äãevent of a power‚Å§ outage, a‚Å£ 2500-watt inverter connected to ‚Äça suitable battery bank‚Äã can provide‚Å¢ a reliable source of emergency power for‚Äã critical‚Å¢ appliances, lighting,‚Äç and medical devices. This ensures‚Äã safety, comfort, and continued ‚Äåaccess to essential services during prolonged disruptions‚Å¢ to‚Å£ the electrical ‚Äçgrid.‚Å¢ The ability to maintain essential ‚Äåfunctions during emergencies offers peace of mind.

## FAQs Section

**What size battery‚Äç do I need to run a 2500-watt inverter?**
The battery size depends on the ‚Äçload you intend to run‚Äå and for how long.‚Å£ As a general rule, calculate the current draw from‚Äã the‚Äç battery by dividing the wattage‚Äå (2500) by the battery voltage‚Å£ (typically 12V ‚Äçor 24V). Then, consider the amp-hour‚Å§ (Ah) rating of your battery and‚Å¢ how long you need to run the inverter. A ‚Å¢larger Ah rating will provide longer run times. ‚ÄçFor prolonged‚Å§ use,‚Å¢ multiple batteries connected in parallel are recommended.

**Can I run my air conditioner‚Äç with a 2500-watt inverter?**
Most small window ‚Å¢air conditioners‚Äã (5000-8000 BTU) fall within‚Äç the power capacity of a 2500-watt inverter.However, air conditioners typically have a high startup surge, which can briefly exceed the inverter's capacity. Choose‚Å¢ an inverter with a surge rating significantly higher than ‚Å¢the air‚Äå conditioner's startup ‚Äãwattage. Also, ensure your‚Å¢ battery bank can handle ‚Å§the‚Å¢ continuous power draw.

**Will a 2500-watt inverter drain my‚Å£ car ‚Äåbattery quickly?**
Yes, a 2500-watt inverter can drain a car battery‚Äå very quickly if the engine is not running. A car battery is designed to ‚Äådeliver a speedy burst of power ‚Äåto ‚Äçstart the engine, not to provide sustained high-wattage output.‚Å¢ Always run‚Å¢ the ‚Äåengine while using ‚Äãthe inverter at high power levels to allow the alternator to recharge the battery. For extended use, a dedicated deep-cycle battery is recommended.

I‚Äôm a soon-to-be first time mom and I was originally planning on using my Baggu giant pocket tote for a diaper bag.

My concern is that I spilled coffee on it like once and I‚Äôve washed it a few times since then but there‚Äôs still a slight brown stain‚Ä¶ which makes me wonder how other stains will show on this thing.

Has anyone used the cloud bag as a diaper bag? It looks like it would be a good idea since it‚Äôs washable and still roomy without being too roomy, I think. Would a cloud bag or a small cloud carry-on be better? Or is all of this just way too much space and am I overthinking how many things a newborn/baby/toddler will need outside of the house?

I expected brighter colors (the finished product looks ok, but my phone enhances colors really well). I expected some details to be lost. But, had to fix the mug as the lip just blended in with the lemon (it shouldn't have), the sailboat didn't have anything to help see the outline, the right shoe blended into the leaf as they used a lot of black in the leaf (I replaced with darker greens), the daisy just blanked out into the sky. I also brought the blues down a bit by the sailboat as that's what it showed on the canvas. I don't like the hands at all, but I don't know how to fix them. I'm not artistic at all, so even the edits were hard for me. 

What I liked is it was easy enough to work on as all symbols were letters and easy to read. There weren't any that were confusing. There were plenty of drills leftover even with me using colors in places that didn't have them.  Even though I expected brighter colors, it turned out well. I like the composition as well.

Amber Chase arrived at the hilltop mansion breathless, realizing the party had already begun without her.

The doorman looked surprised to see her. ""Miss Chase, what are you doing here? Everyone's already finished dinner...""

Her husband's birthday celebration, yet they'd forgotten to include his wife. Among all the guests from their social circle, not a single person had bothered to notify her.

She smiled at the doorman and was about to push open the door when she overheard a conversation from inside:

""Victoria, what gift did you bring? Blake has been eyeing your gift bag for half the evening.""

""Have I?""

""You haven't even opened it yet, but you've been eyeing that bag so hard you're practically drilling holes in it! Since Victoria's finally back from overseas, you should just dump Amber already. She totally kills the vibe.""

""For real! She drugged you and jumped into your bed. If you hadn't gone all soft and worried about her reputation by making her your wife, she'd be toast by now. Everyone would've ripped her to shreds.""

The man sitting in the center wore a crisp dark suit with the top two buttons of his shirt undone. His features were striking and aggressive, with naturally deep-set eyes, a high nose, and thin lips. Like a brilliantly poisonous butterfly, his slightly upturned eyes carried a distant, aloof arrogance.

""No rush,"" he said coolly.

""Blake, it's been three years and you're still not in a hurry? Back then, she caused Victoria's sister to become a vegetative patient. If your grandmother hadn't protected her, we would have destroyed her long ago.""

Blake Westwood's elegant fingers played with a lighter in his hand as he caught a glimpse of a shadow at the doorway.

Only then did the group notice that Amber had been standing there for who knows how long.

Someone whispered, ""Who invited her?""

No one answered. Clearly, she had come uninvited.

Amber lowered her lashes. She had a delicate, cool beauty with an oval face and wore a light cashmere sweater. Her forehead was framed by hair gently tucked behind her ears. Just looking at that innocent face, nobody would believe she could pull off such shameless stunts, but she definitely did all that stuff.

She clutched a gift in her hands and looked toward Blake sitting at the center. Her chest felt as if it were bound by wire, the pain penetrating deeply, making her fingers clench tightly.

She walked to his side, but before she could offer her carefully prepared gift, she saw him slightly furrow his brow and casually mock her: ""Who invited you?""

Laughter erupted around them, shattering what remained of her pride.

Victoria, standing nearby, gave Blake a reproachful glance before pulling Amber to sit down. ""She's still your wife. It's only right for her to bring you a gift. Amber, sit down. Blake just has a terrible temperament.""

Amber pressed her lips together without speaking. She was his wife, yet needed his ex-fianc√©e to smooth things over. No one here welcomed her, but she had come anyway, just because when he was eighteen, he had promised they would celebrate his twenty-eighth birthday together.

She deliberately sat next to Blake, displacing Victoria.

Victoria's expression faltered momentarily before becoming somewhat unpleasant. Then she asked, ""What gift did you bring for Blake?""

A mischievous guest immediately opened it, revealing a scarf without tags that appeared handmade.

Victoria's voice rose again, ""Oh my! We must be connected somehow‚ÄîI also brought Blake a scarf.""

The two scarves now sat side by side, both handmade, with no discernible difference in craftsmanship.

Someone accidentally bumped the table, causing an open bottle of wine to spill toward both scarves.

Blake reached out and took one of them, while the other became soaked with wine and reeked of alcohol.

He had taken Victoria's scarf.

Seeing the scarf she had knitted for two months soaking in wine, Amber's face turned pale for reasons she couldn't explain, her heart feeling both numb and dull.

Victoria sighed, sympathetically linking arms with her. ""Amber, don't be upset. This one can still be used after washing.""

Amber still didn't respond, instead looking toward Blake.

He kept his lashes lowered, hiding the emotions in his eyes.

The atmosphere got super awkward, with Amber basically crashing what was supposed to be a fun celebration. Everyone started making excuses to leave.

She just sat there motionless, staring at the scarf abandoned on the coffee table, discarded just like her.

As others gradually left, she fixed her gaze on Blake, who was also about to stand. ""Blake, happy birthday,"" she said softly.

Blake acted as if he hadn't heard. When he was twenty-one, he had just been reunited with the Westwood family. By then, he was already a self-made business prodigy with nineteen-year-old Amber by his side.

Seven years later, the business prodigy had become a titan at the center of power, but any feelings between them had long since vanished.

Those difficult early days of struggling together in obscurity now seemed like another lifetime.

Blake had Victoria escorted home.

Victoria reached out and lightly touched his shoulder. ""Talk things through with her. Don't keep fighting.""

Someone scoffed quietly, ""Victoria, you're too kind-hearted.""

""I'm not kind-hearted. I just think the young Amber didn't know any better back then. I'm sure she didn't mean it.""

""Bullshit. She ruined someone's life and shamelessly stole your place. How dare she show her face again.""

Their voices were filled with disgust, growing fainter as they left.

Amber sat motionless, as if paralyzed, every drop of blood running cold, her lips losing their color.

She stood up, grabbed the soaked scarf, and looked at Blake.

""Blake.""

Her voice was gentle as she called his name.

Blake had already draped his suit jacket over his arm. Hearing her, he loosened his tie slightly without looking at her, his brow visibly irritated. ""What now?""

She smiled faintly, her beautiful lips forming the words: ""Let's get divorced, Blake.""

Surprise flashed in his eyes, quickly replaced by layered malice in his expression. ""What new game is this? First you drug me to get me to sleep with you, and now you're acting noble and asking for divorce? Aren't you tired of these tactics, Amber?""

""I'm sorry for wasting three years of your life, but I'm serious this time.""

Blake's mocking expression disappeared inch by inch as he yanked her close, his fingers digging into her chin. Seeing her wince in pain somehow eased his unexplainable frustration. ""Now you're talking about wasting time? Where the hell were you three years ago? Listen up, Amber‚Äîyou want a divorce? Fine! But you won't see a single fucking penny from me!""

""I'll leave with nothing.""

Her eyes were clear, her voice still calm and untainted.

After the Westwoods finally tracked down Blake, they promptly adopted Amber‚Äîwho'd been by his side‚Äîas their goddaughter. Everyone knew exactly what they were doing: the family didn't want their precious second-in-line, the backup heir to the Westwood fortune, marrying some nobody with an ordinary background, so they gave her this goddaughter status to shut people up.

Blake stared at her cool face, his throat working silently as he turned away.

""Fine. Nothing. Don't regret it.""

Chapter 2

Outside, rain had begun to fall without anyone noticing. The mansion was on a hilltop in the suburbs, making it difficult to get a taxi.

The others had already left in their cars. Amber, who had arrived by taxi, was now the last one remaining. She stood under the eaves, watching the drizzle.

A black Rolls-Royce cut through the rain and stopped in front of her. The window lowered, revealing Blake's assistant's face‚ÄîDevon Ward.

""Mrs. Westwood, please get in.""

Amber remained standing, her gaze penetrating the car window crack, seeming to know someone else sat inside.

She didn't speak, and Blake's voice rose from within.

""Drive. Let her cool off out here.""

Devon looked uncomfortable but had no choice. He drove away.

Amber watched the car leave, blinking as raindrops drifted in and landed on her face, their coolness penetrating to her marrow.

At eighteen, Blake had looked forward to celebrating his twenty-eighth birthday with her, but at twenty-eight, he thoroughly despised her.

During these three years, he hadn't touched her once, had barely even come home.

Society gossips said she was the most pitiful among all the women who had married into powerful families. All she had was a beautiful cage and nothing else.

In everyone's eyes, she was the villain who had caused Victoria's sister Sophia to become a vegetative patient and then stolen Victoria's fianc√©. She deserved universal contempt.

But no one seemed to remember that from age twelve to nineteen, she had accompanied him from his lowest point to his rise to prominence.

Everyone said the Westwoods had already done her a huge favor with that goddaughter title, but she still wasn't satisfied‚Äîusing those seven years together to emotionally blackmail Blake for life.

Another seven years had passed. All told, she had been by Blake's side for fourteen years.

She lowered her lashes, staring at the rideshare request on her phone. Still no drivers willing to accept the trip.

By the time she returned to River Haven, it was already two in the morning. Her skirt was soaked, clinging to her ankles. In the deep autumn night, it was so cold her lips trembled slightly.

Lights were still on inside the mansion. As she changed her shoes in the entryway, she saw the man sitting on the sofa handling business documents.

Blake's bone structure was exceptional. No matter how long one looked at him, his appearance remained stunning and captivating.

Sitting there, he resembled an unattainable snow-capped mountain.

Amber certainly didn't think he was waiting for her. Three years ago, they had completely fallen out, and she had transformed from a once-bright young woman into someone who barely recognized the shrew she saw in the mirror.

She quietly changed her shoes, tossed the scarf into the garbage bin by the door, and went upstairs.

The master bedroom contained many of her things, kept clean and cozy, since Blake had rarely returned home in the past three years. Everyone mocked her for living as a married single woman.

She pulled out a small suitcase and packed some of her regularly worn clothes. As for the wall of luxury bags and jewelry, she had never touched them.

Blake had said she wasn't worthy.

In his eyes, she was a gold-digger. Placing luxury items in front of her but forbidding her to use them was his form of torture.

Amber came downstairs with her suitcase and placed the signed divorce agreement on the coffee table.

""Blake, I've signed it.""

During these three years, they fought whenever they met‚Äîmore accurately, she would unilaterally accuse him of coldness, desperately trying to get his attention like a madwoman. He would stand silently, watching her lose control with a detached, cold indifference.

Blake's gaze shifted from his computer to her suitcase, his throat burning as if someone had poured sulfuric acid down it, scorching from his throat to his stomach.

He sneered, his cold, mocking voice like a sharp knife threatening to pierce her eardrums. ""Bringing this tiny bit of stuff‚Äîwhat, you planning to keep coming back for more every few weeks? Amber, did you forget how you landed this position in the first place? I was engaged to Victoria, and you drugged me at our engagement party, got us caught in bed together, and forced me to marry you.""

""Yeah, that's on me.""

She gripped the handle of her suitcase, her face draining of color, her damp skirt making her appear on the verge of collapse.

Her fingers clenched tightly. After a long silence, she finally spoke hoarsely.

""Blake, I want to know‚Äîwhy did you suddenly stop loving me?""

She had pondered this question many times over the past three years. Back when they huddled together in that cramped apartment, he had said Blake would love Amber forever. Later, after the Westwood family found him, people had warned her to take some money and leave, saying the Westwoods would never accept a daughter-in-law of her background.

She hadn't listened, clinging to his promise, waiting for him to come marry her in grand style.

Instead, she received news of his engagement to Victoria. He said he no longer loved her.

How could he stop loving her so suddenly?

""Because you're not worthy.""

Those words hit her like a hammer blow, making her dizzy.

She couldn't describe the pain. Her heart felt punctured in countless places, bleeding profusely.

When he loved her, he said Amber was the best girl in the world. When he stopped loving her, he casually said she wasn't worthy.

With her ordinary background, she had defended their love in front of those high-society heirs who looked down on her. In their eyes, she was a presumptuous clown.

But she had always thought of herself as a knight, believing his engagement must have been due to unavoidable circumstances.

She had deceived herself for three years. Now it was time to wake up from the dream.

She picked up her suitcase and walked to the entryway. ""Sign it, then. I'll wait for you at the registry office tomorrow at noon.""

After saying this, she changed her shoes, tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, and smiled. ""Blake, I'm sorry for bothering you all these years.""

Blake's grip on the contract documents trembled with such force that he nearly pierced the paper, then helplessly released them.

""Yes, finally some relief.""

Hearing this, Amber couldn't help but feel hurt. She wanted to smile but found she couldn't.

She could only turn and leave.

Devon was waiting at the door. Seeing her with the suitcase, his face showed conflict. ""Mrs. Westwood, the boss didn't intentionally forget to notify you last night. He...""

Amber dragged her suitcase into the rain, seemingly unwilling to stay a moment longer.

But after a few steps, she stopped and turned to Devon, who still stood at the door. ""The Pine Creek Estate‚Äîwho is he keeping there? Can you tell me?""

Devon tensed visibly, quickly lowering his head, seemingly surprised she knew about that place.

Seeing his reaction, Amber took a small breath. ""He's been keeping someone there for three years, hasn't he?""

""Mrs. Westwood, I'm sorry, I don't know anything about that.""

How could he not know? He was Blake's closest confidant.

Amber wiped away the gentle rain from her face, her clothes getting soaked. ""It's fine. You don't have to tell me.""

""Mrs. Westwood...""

But Amber had already stepped into the rain.

When she gave Blake her first time at eighteen, she had imagined their future together.

She never expected that at twenty-six, everything would be shattered, and letting him go would feel like carving out half of her flesh and blood.

But she truly didn't want this anymore.

Chapter 3

When she arrived at her sister Jordan's house dragging her luggage, Amber felt somewhat embarrassed.

After leaving River Haven, she had brought nothing with her except two hundred dollars in cash.

During her three years of marriage, she had developed severe depression amid constant arguments. Afraid to face people, she had stayed in the mansion perfecting her cooking skills, not caring even when her hands were covered in blood blisters. She still loved Blake and wanted to salvage their precarious relationship.

But the meals had grown cold so many times, and he had never eaten them.

Jordan wasn't her biological sister. They had run away from their village together years ago. Jordan had quickly been adopted by a family and now was married, living with her partner in a modest 700-square-foot apartment with a peaceful, warm life.

Later, Amber met Blake when she was near starvation, and he had tossed her a bread roll. She had shamelessly attached herself to him, working alongside him to earn money.

Amber's body was still dripping wet. She quickly wiped her face and rang the doorbell.

Jordan opened the door in her pajamas, looking surprised. From the bedroom came her husband's impatient voice: ""Who is it?""

Jordan pulled her inside and hurried to the bathroom for a clean towel.

""Amber, why are you here in the middle of the night? You're soaking wet. Did you fight with Blake?""

""Can I stay here tonight, sis?""

""Of course. We have an extra bedroom. It's tiny, but I hope you don't mind.""

Jordan handed her a new pair of pajamas and efficiently prepared the bed.

The bathroom was narrow, barely fitting two people, but it had separate wet and dry areas. The corner was covered with brownish water stains that had never been cleaned away.

She quickly took a shower, too embarrassed to use the hair dryer at this hour, and went straight to the bedroom.

The room was indeed small, with just a five-foot bed and a narrow desk.

She heard her brother-in-law's voice from the master bedroom.

""Who is it?""

""Amber. She probably had a fight with Blake.""

""She's a wealthy socialite wife. What's she doing in our place? Don't you know who Blake Westwood is? I've been working in the lowest ranks of Westwood Industries for three years and haven't even glimpsed him once.""

""Enough, Amber is my sister.""

The whispered conversation stopped.

Amber dabbed at her hair with the towel, wrapped it up turban-style, and simply lay down on the bed.

At seven in the morning, the kitchen already echoed with the sounds of breakfast being prepared.

Her hair had dried naturally overnight, but she had a headache and forced herself to get up.

The table was set with five small dishes. Her brother-in-law, Mark Quinn, was setting out plates and noticed her approach. ""Amber, come sit! I bought fish early this morning and had your sister make fish soup.""

They were both working professionals who normally made do with a few slices of bread for breakfast. They had prepared this spread especially for Amber's visit.

Jordan brought over three plates of scrambled eggs and toast, smiling at her. ""Dig in.""

Amber's skin was luminously pale. Since clinging to Blake's side from the age of twelve, he had never mistreated her.

During those impressionable years, she thought it was love, never suspecting he merely saw her as a sister.

She lowered her lashes, her face pained from the headache.

Mark enthusiastically pushed a plate of ribs toward her. ""Jordan got up at five to cook. Hey Amber, did you know I work at Westwood Industries? My supervisor is such a bootlicker, yesterday he made a girl in our department cry. Word is he got in through connections and has cut my salary twice already. Could you maybe put in a word with Blake for me?""

Jordan glared at him, but Mark just smiled.

She quickly ladled some fish soup for Amber. ""You look unwell, and you got rained on last night. Have some soup to warm up, and don't listen to him.""

Amber looked up, her pale face bearing an unhealthy flush. ""I'm sorry, Mark, but Blake and I are getting divorced.""

This statement was met with several seconds of silence at the table.

Mark's surprise flashed briefly across his face before he asked, ""So he's giving you half his fortune? Amber, even though he paid for your education at the best university, you married him right after graduation, right? You've never actually worked, so you probably don't know how to manage money. I'm concerned someone might take advantage of you with all that money.""

""Mark!"" Jordan reprimanded sharply.

Finally, Mark fell silent and took a bite of food.

Jordan had known Amber since childhood. They had journeyed to NY together, like two raindrops merging into a vast sea, where survival itself was a challenge. She got adopted, while Amber bounced from job to job with Blake. Thankfully, Blake treated her decently, working himself to exhaustion to put her through school.

She took a deep breath. ""Just keep your money safe. If you want to buy property, Mark can recommend some‚Ä¶""

""I'm leaving with nothing,"" Amber interrupted. ""He's not giving me any money.""

Mark's expression darkened. After devouring most of the ribs, he stood up and told Jordan, ""I forgot to mention, Mom wants to take you for a medical check-up in a few days. Clear out the guest room‚Äîfamily comes first.""

Jordan remained silent as the front door opened and closed. Mark was gone.

The feast on the table suddenly seemed to lose its appeal.

""Sis, I'm sorry for putting you in an awkward position.""

Jordan's eyes reddened as she sighed. ""I'm not uncomfortable. But how did things get like this between you two? I remember he used to be so good to you. When you secretly got a job without telling him, he scolded you. He worked five jobs a day to support both your educations, and all his scholarship money went to you. Remember that year when you nearly became brain-damaged in that car accident? He worked translations non-stop that year to earn money. How could he now‚Ä¶""",2,1752260484.0,Novelnews,3,1.0,False

Tl;dr:

1. Don‚Äôt be afraid to go off-piste from the trail itself. Especially on the segment from Cavendish to St. Peter‚Äôs Bay. You‚Äôll have to deal with more traffic, but there are dedicated bike lanes along the sea on the north coast that are worth it.

2. If you want to eat fancy ‚Äî and there are a lot of great options to do so ‚Äî you have to make reservations way in advance. We did not. But we still ate really well - it‚Äôs hard to go wrong on PEI, truly. Everything else we were able to just walk in no problem. 

3. The trail is incredibly obvious - no maps needed. Cell service is pretty hit or miss on PEI. Bring extra tubes, because there are long stretches pretty far away from any population centers.

4. We spent about $2000 USD for two people over 4 days, including all transportation, rentals, lodging and food. Not cheap for a bike trip, but mostly bike rental and transfer.


Logistics:

1. We rented our bikes from MacQueens in Charlottetown. ~$600 USD for 4 days.

2. Transportation - if you want to bike across the whole province, you need to get from one side to the other (duh). MacQueens offers transportation across the island for ~$500 USD. We found an independent guy (DJ transport and delivery) who did it for $350 USD. It‚Äôs a little over 3 hours to drive from Elmira (east tip) to Tignish (northwest). 

2a. If I had to do it again, I‚Äôd leave my car in Charlottetown, and take two shuttles, one from Ch‚Äôtown to Tignish, and then have them pick us up in Elmira and shuttle us back to the shop. The way we did it added a lot of driving, and a 3+ hour ride with a transport service isn‚Äôt the most fun thing in the world. 

3. We rented ebikes, (because they have saved our marriage :) ) ‚Äî so that my wife enjoys these types of trips. This same itinerary could easily be done on amish (aka regular) bikes; the distances were relatively modest, with little elevation change, and optimized for food, coffee and ice cream breaks.

Stated range was ~100km, and we got ~70km on normal assist, which means we charged for about an hour a day while having lunch. Worked out perfectly, as we typically stopped at least three times for 30 mins or so. Coffee+lunch+ice cream. Range anxiety wasn‚Äôt a big problem once you realize there are standard plugs everywhere. Just be sure to get the key and adapter to be able to remove the bike battery. Most B&Bs let us bring the bikes inside to charge, but it‚Äôs a hassle, and restaurants obviously will not. 

We averaged ~14mph, and were only technically riding between 2 and 4.5 hours per day. Though there were many more hours of futzing, retreating from the elements, and changing flats‚Ä¶


Lodging:

We broke the trip up into 4 days and 3 nights, so that the first and last days on the trail would be half days to accommodate the car-shuttling. 

1. Our first night we stayed at the Mill River resort, which has an ‚Äúaquaplex,‚Äù aka pool, hottub and coily water slide. Having a hot tub at the end of the day was amazing. The resort itself was surprisingly cool - I wish we‚Äôd had the legs and time to play squash or take advantage of more. Food served just down the hall, so didn‚Äôt have to get back in the saddle to eat dinner. Not bad eats ‚Äî definitely not in contention for great meals we had on the island ‚Äî but A+ for logistics.

2. The second night we stayed at Clinton Pond B&B. The surrounding area was very hilly and beautiful, and our hosts were amazing. Got to do laundry, another hot tub soak, and of course, a box set DVD of Anne of Green Gables, which helped lend context to the surrounding Cavendish region. There was a HUGE hill to get to a great local seafood dinner on the water (Sou‚Äôwest). If we hadn‚Äôt had the ebikes, it would have been adding salt to an already tough day. 

3. Our last night we splurged and stayed at Mysa Nordic Retreat/Spa. Couldn‚Äôt recommend this place more highly, in general, but also specifically for recovering from three days of biking through the elements. Incredible hot/cold/steam/dry saunas, recovery rooms, etc. But the food was even more clutch ‚Äî without a doubt some of the best food we had during our three week trip to PEI, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. This evening completely broke the budget, but was worth it. If we didn‚Äôt have to return the bikes, we might have stayed another night altogether. 

Food:

Each day we were fortunate to find food, coffee, and dessert that broke up the day‚Äôs ride. Some of our favorites:

Day 1: Short day - totally fine dinner at Mill River. 

Day 2: Valley Pearl Oysters - the best oysters (and maybe lunch in general) of our entire trip. Across the street is an adorable tea shop (tyne valley teas cafe) where we stuffed ourselves with scones and clotted cream and everything blueberry. Holman‚Äôs Ice Cream is a must stop in summerside. Really really good dinner at Sou‚Äôwest near Clinton. Tried to get into the Table Culinary Studio, but didn‚Äôt plan ahead properly for their once-per-day seating‚Ä¶

Day 3. Frothy coffee was best third-wave cafe on the Island we found. Fin Folk Food near Dalvay was one of the best meals of the trip. Incredible fish tacos and unique breading for fish and chips. Awesome view and cool architecture. As said above, dinner at Mysa (guests only I think?) was a top 3 meal on our maritime Canada trip. Same goes with the breakfast. Pork belly breakfast plate!

Day 4. Short day - finished the ride at a local fish shack ‚Äî North Lake Boathouse ‚Äî which was surprisingly good. 

Note: We had a few fancy restaurants on our list (the table culinary studio, north shore canteen, fireworks feast) but they were booked up seemingly a month in advance. I reckon all of the tours get first crack at these. In our normal life, we‚Äôve found you can just walk into places like these if you show up day-of, but that was absolutely not the case here :/


Honestly, it was a fantastic vacation trip. Not too tough, with great creature comforts, including beautiful scenery, lots of birds, great food. On an ebike it‚Äôs even more chill. Highly recommend!


*A hot take: Geographically, the confederation trail itself is fairly flat and redundant, except for a few segments. (Everyone notes that Morrell to St. Peters Bay is gorgeous, but we also liked from St. Peter‚Äôs Bay all the way to Elmira.) It makes sense that it‚Äôs flat because it‚Äôs an old railroad, so obviously it‚Äôs going to skip a lot of hills. But for me, this erased a lot of the charm of the island that we experienced when driving backroads and when navigating to our hotels for the evening. If I did it again, I‚Äôd opt for more back roads and less bike trail, to be honest. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, our time on the trail itself was great ‚Äî quiet, and pastoral and pretty ‚Äî but a bit boring if you stay the whole way.

1lxf5ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/flyfishing/comments/1lxf5ga/collaboration_opportunity_roaring_fork_float_trip/,Collaboration Opportunity: Roaring Fork float trip next Tuesday AM?,"This is a long shot with a long backstory, will try to keep it short-ish....

I grew up in Colorado and moved away decades ago. I'm bringing my kiddos home to visit the 'rents on the Front Range next week, and we're going to get a whopping 1.5 days in the hills. We're driving up to the Roaring Fork Valley on Monday, having dinner with some old friends and camping in their backyard on Monday night. 

I'd hoped to float the Fork (or the Colorado, if necessary) on Tuesday morning. That's partly because I'm almost desperate for my kids to do a proper river float, preferably in a drift boat (because drift boats rule), but also because I need to do some photography and get anecdotes for a magazine article. 

Catching fish actually isn't the priority for this run, which is good since it looks like flows are ridiculously low and water temps are getting into the danger zone for trout mortality by midday. I've been doing rain dances all week, but it doesn't seem to be working.

If we caught a fish or two, that'd be great. But this run would be more about the joy of floating a gorgeous river and making a few pretty pictures, a couple of which will hopefully feature some serious casting. My son grew on a skiff in the salt and punches fast, tight loops, but he hasn't done much trout fishing. It should be fairly entertaining watching him transition from throwing 90ft with a 9wt down to 20ft with a 4wt.

The arrangements I'd made for two boats just fell through. Got a boat or two and want an excuse to do a short float next Tuesday morning? Better yet, got a small fishing-related business that needs some free PR? Here's your chance to get published in a magazine and hang out with some fishy casting nerds. We'll cover breakfast tacos, fried chicken, beers, and gas -- and we'll have a vehicle we can use to shuttle.

PM me if this might work for you. I'll actually be shocked if this comes together, but crazier things have happened! And if it doesn't work out.....well, I've missed the huevos rancheros at the Two Rivers, and you won't catch me crying into my coffee.",1,1752260121.0,flyfishing,0,1.0,False

At the initial meet and greet, I noticed Apollo had think, dark wax (consistency of coffee grounds) in his right ear. The foster offered to take them back for a week to treat what they suspected was an ear infection, so I officially took them home after that and was given the remaining Tresaderm drops. The wax came back a couple weeks later, although more fluid-like and lighter in color, so I finished the Tresaderm on a week-on, week-off schedule. Since then, so for over a year, the fluid in his ear and a slight odor has come back every couple of weeks. When he shakes his head, it almost sounds like a baby rattle from the fluid build-up. I‚Äôve taken him to three different vets over the last year who have each prescribed different courses of drops to try to clear up the fluid as well as doing ear cytologies to rule out other issues (no deformities, no active infection with redness or swelling, etc), so the fluid is not from an ear infection. The most recent vet is suspecting that it may be an allergy because he gets acne on his chin occasionally as well. Has anyone else ever dealt with something like this before? Could this just be a lifelong ear issue because of the initial infection he had as a kitten? If he went the first few weeks of his life before I adopted him with an untreated infection, would that have consequences to this day? My next course of action is to get his blood tested for allergens, but that‚Äôs gonna run me at least $800 on top of the couple grand I‚Äôve already spent taking him to these vet visits over the last year. Just trying to see if anyone else has ever experienced this and if you were able to get your baby some relief.

Also, cold air makes it difficult, it's like I feel my bronchial tubes closing.  I very seldom wheeze, I cough, and feel like I'm trying to breathe through a coffee stir stick.    We moved to the city, and my asthma was better, visiting family on their farm sends me to urgent care almost every time unless I start prednisone before we go.  

Now.  I got sick last year, and was sick like never in my life for months on end.  Endless steroids, injected, oral, inhaled.  Multiple rounds of antibiotics.  May have cracked a rib from the coughing.  This sent me down an absolute rabbit hole.  I saw an allergy and asthma specialist who says I don't have asthma.  Not sure what this guy's deal is, but he was pretty dismissive.  Allergy tests show that the only thing I reacted to was dust and that was really strong.  (So, why do I break out in hives when I'm even near balloons or latex gloves, and why do I cough and sneeze around cats, cottonwood trees, long-haired dogs, etc?)  Anyway.  My family doctor, who has treated me for 20 years, says of course I have asthma.  Pulmonologist said yep, asthma, put me on Symbicort, which I had to fight insurance for.  I have thrush constantly (no immunity to candida) but I can breathe better than ever before.

1lxewq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1lxewq1/does_the_keurig_kslim_brewer_deliver_quality_in_a/,Does the Keurig K-Slim Brewer Deliver Quality in a Compact Design?,"The Keurig K-Slim Single Serve Coffee Maker product, item number 5000376527, has been a delightful addition to my daily routine. I spend a lot of time moving between my kitchen and home office, so finding a coffee maker that balances speed, convenience, and flavor was a necessity. With a sleek design, versatile brewing options, and compact size, this machine ticks a lot of boxes‚Äîbut as any reviewer would say, no product is without its quirks.  

**Compact and Space-Saving Design**  
One of the standout features is how compact the coffee maker is without sacrificing functionality. At just over 8 inches in width, it doesn‚Äôt gobble up counter space. My kitchen tends to feel cluttered quickly, but this machine slipped right into an empty nook without disrupting the aesthetic. The matte black exterior finish adds a modern touch and looks surprisingly high-end for such an affordable appliance.  

[Check Keurig 5000376527 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0bv9hkmnt/)  

**Versatile Brewing Options**  
I loved that you can brew multiple cup sizes‚Äî6, 8, or 10 ounces. For someone like me who needs stronger coffee to jumpstart the day, using the 6-ounce setting for a concentrated brew was a lifesaver. My spouse, who prefers lighter roasts, enjoyed the 8-ounce size, perfect for a medium-bodied cup. It‚Äôs versatile enough to suit the coffee preferences of anyone in the household.  

**Smart Start Feature**  
The Smart Start feature eliminates unnecessary waiting. With most coffee makers, you have to wait for the water to heat before choosing the cup size, but this machine simplifies the process by seamlessly combining heating and brewing. For someone like me, who‚Äôs perpetually running late, this tiny detail is a big win.  

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance**  
I was pleasantly surprised by the removable drip tray, which accommodates travel mugs up to 7 inches tall. It can also hold accidental drips, saving me from cleaning constant spills. Additionally, the 36-ounce removable reservoir simplifies refilling. It lasted through three to four cups of coffee before needing to be replenished, making it perfect for weekday mornings when you don‚Äôt want to fiddle around before that first sip.  

**Energy Efficiency and Convenience Features**  
The auto-off feature that powers down the machine after two hours is a thoughtful touch, especially since I often forget to turn off appliances. This not only adds convenience but also aligns with energy efficiency goals. Additionally, the machine dispenses hot water on demand‚Äîperfect when I want a quick cup of tea or hot cocoa.

**Pluses**  
- Sleek and modern design that fits small spaces effortlessly.  
- Brews in under a minute, perfect for busy mornings.  
- Multiple cup size options allow for a customized coffee experience.  
- Smart Start feature makes the brewing process seamless and efficient.  

**Limitations**  
- The machine struggles with brewing certain off-brand pods, which can be limiting if you‚Äôre not exclusively using Keurig products.  
- The water reservoir, while effective, feels slightly flimsy when you detach it for refilling.  
- It doesn‚Äôt include a reusable My K-Cup¬Æ filter, so you‚Äôll have to purchase that separately if you want to use your own coffee grounds.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing this single-serve coffee maker to similar brands like Nespresso and Hamilton Beach, there are definite pros and cons. Nespresso offers a better crema layer for espresso lovers and sleeker capsule options, but cleaning their machines feels much more laborious. On the other hand, Hamilton Beach single-serve coffee makers are more budget-friendly but fall short on speed and adaptability in pod compatibility. The Keurig K-Slim sits nicely between these options, delivering the perfect balance of quality, ease-of-use, and price point.

**Price Worthiness**  
As someone who‚Äôs tested similar coffee machines across different price ranges, I can confidently say this product offers great value for its price. It‚Äôs affordable without being cheap and includes enough high-quality features to justify the investment. If you‚Äôre aiming for a dependable coffee maker suited for small spaces, this might be it.

1lxev8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/JohnAndCarolyn/comments/1lxev8c/gogo_ferguson_on_planning_the_wedding_with_john/,Gogo Ferguson on planning the wedding with John & Carolyn + wedding details,"Gogo coordinated the extraordinary marriage of John Kennedy, Jr., and Carolyn Bessette in the little church on September 21, 1996. Tabloid writers and the paparazzi would have killed to be there. But they didn't know of the event, which was pulled off in total secrecy in a feat befitting the CIA.

John-John was a longtime friend of Gogo's. He had been coming to Cumberland since his mid-twenties, staying mostly at Greyfield Inn. Gogo's daughter, Hannah, was just beginning to walk, and he fell in love with her. He agreed to serve on Gogo's board for the Plum Orchard artists' retreat and pledged to help her raise the $10 million needed for the mansion's renovation.

""He loved to get away, loved his privacy, loved to be able to kayak,"" Gogo says. ""He was a great athlete. He jogged every morning or swam from Sea Camp dock, which was just astounding. I don't think any member of our family ever did that. He would hike around the island or go clamming. It was obvious he loved Cumberland for the same reasons we did.""

Carolyn began coming to Cumberland with him. She loved it as he did. It cloaked them in privacy and gave them a respite from the photographers and the curious who forever stalked them.

""We saw a lot of them on Martha's Vineyard, where I lead a very chaotic life during the summer,"" Gogo says. ""I have two stores up there, and it's usually seven days a week. Sometimes, we would take a Sunday off and spend a day on his mother's now his sister's compound and play football and go to the beach and have wonderful dinners. We would play with the dogs and play a lot of tennis.

""And one night, we were asked to come out to the compound. They said they were thinking of getting married, which didn't surprise me. But they wanted to do it on Cumberland. 'Wow,' I said.

""I knew that was going to be logistically very hard to do. But I also knew that it was the one gift I could give two friends that no one else could give them. It was their privacy. To me, it was such a wonderful thing to do for people who were so constantly followed. I thought it was something that I should do.""

The planning began. Carolyn started flying down quite often to Cumberland. She sometimes brought her mother or her friend Gordon Henderson from Calvin Klein, who helped plan the wedding details.

""We had to hide Carolyn because everyone down here could have recognized her and noticed what was going on,"" Gogo says. ""We would keep her on the floorboard of the car when we were going up to the church, all the way to the north end of the island.""

""We had to hire Liz McComis with a fifty-five-gallon drum to wash the entire church. The ceiling was all cobwebs and mud daubers. We oiled the floor, and we oiled the benches. That was done just before Carolyn came down one time, so she could have an idea of what it would look like. So the church got a good cleaning.

""At that point, I talked them into at least telling Mitty \[Gogo's brother\] and Mary \[Mitty's wife\] because they were running Greyfield Inn. This was a major wedding, even if it was a small one. It had to be done just the way John and Carolyn wanted it. Mary would never have forgiven me if I had not told her. ""I told Mary that we needed tables because Carolyn wanted a beautiful sit-down affair for the rehearsal dinner on the porch at Greyfield. We had to have the right tables and right chairs over here because Gordon Henderson and Carolyn designed all the tablecloths and covers for each night. They were made in New York. I mean, she really saw to every little detail. She had the most amazing taste.

""Every plate was sprinkled with gold and silver almonds and beads from Balducci's. It was absolutely beautiful. Her flowers were beautiful. Bunny Mellon \[a friend of John's late mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis\] had sent exquisite bouquets down for Carolyn and the kids. And in all the chaos of getting truckloads of people to the church-and trying to find John's father's shirt that he wanted to wear evidently no one was in charge of the flowers. So they got left in the refrigerator. And what you see her carrying is mistletoe and some lily of the valley that had been flown in from Holland for the rehearsal dinner. That was Bunny's gift-the beautiful flowers that they didn't use. Well, I think they used them for some of the table settings.

""Carolyn wanted circular tents and white-oak dance floors. We had them shipped from Chattanooga, some from North Carolina. Everything had to be brought over on a boat. A lot of their china and other things they wanted to use were shipped from New York.

""And I had to buy out \[reservations\] at the inn. It was already booked when John and Carolyn gave me the wedding date. I had only four to six weeks to do this. We found one week when those who had reservations were willing to have a free weekend at Greyfield in order to give up their reservations. We told them that a friend of the family was getting married, and everyone understood.

""John and Carolyn decided that, right from the beginning, they wouldn't tell any of their family. I didn't tell any of our family because once it got out, someone was just not going to be able to resist telling their brother or their sister, and it was just going to be a chain reaction from then on.

""Thank God we had people like \[Camden County probate judge\] Martin Gillette, who is very professional and did not ask any questions. I just told him that they were dear friends of mine who were getting married, and they are having a hard time getting their blood tests and marriage license done, and could he meet me at the airport in St. Marys and have that done. It was done right on the plane. Of course, they then realized what was going on, but they vowed they would not say anything until Monday. And they did not say anything until Monday.

""No regular wedding invitations went out to the guests. No one knew. No one even realized. I think John and Carolyn just sent plane tickets and said, Please be here at this time People came from everywhere. Christiane Amanpour, the big CNN correspondent, a dear friend of John's from Brown University, came over from the Middle East. People made a huge effort. I am sure it was an unspoken invitation, that everyone knew exactly what was happening but was pledged to secrecy.

""We took over every house on the Greyfield compound, and the inn, Thank God we had a security group. A wonderful man from Jacksonville who used to be with the FBI had been a guest quite often at the inn, and he had a security group that did this sort of thing. He had a laser beam around the Greyfield compound, which of course was triggered by every wild horse that went through it at night. But it kept the security people on their toes. You could see their flashlights out in the woods all night long, All of our staff at the inn were so honorable because they knew that John and Carolyn were friends of ours. They were friends of the \[staff\] as well. No one broke the silence

There was one paparazzi from France that did get on the compound beforehand that was removed. They just told him that he had to leave early that morning before the wedding happened because there was a problem with the boat, and he was going to have to get on the early boat, and he would have to leave. He was not happy, but he ended up leaving.

""We had, gosh, I don't know, maybe twenty or twenty-five people staying here. There weren't many plush situations for sleeping. We had people on lawn chairs and mattresses and couches. It was quite something Everyone seemed comfortable, and everyone was just so amazed by the island that it didn't really matter.""

The elegant rehearsal dinner was held on the front porch of Greyfield. ""It was like a dream, really just like a dream,"" Gogo says."" The tents \[for the wedding dance next evening\] weren't even set up. Carolyn didn't want the tents set up until the next morning, so that it would be just that beautiful oak tree and the candles lit all around the porches of Greyfield.

""Then everyone retired to the beach house, the gazebo, for cognac and cigars and dessert. They walked down. And as we came over the beach dune on the beach road, there were hundreds of tiki torches all around the gazebo. It was the most spectacular sight. We had a big bonfire going, and everyone that came over the dune started screaming when they saw it.

""The way the bride got dressed for her wedding was pretty funny. I called Mary Warren, who is the matriarch of High Point, just four days before the wedding, and I said, 'Mary, you can't even tell Billy this. Some-one on our board is being married, and it has to be completely quiet. Could we use the hotel at High Point or your house to have them change for the wedding at the church? She said absolutely. We changed in her house because I believe some of the kids in the Candler family were staying at the old hotel.

""The tide was too high \[to drive on the beach from Greyfield to High Point), so I had to bounce Carolyn up all the way on Grand Avenue. They had had very little sleep from the rehearsal dinner at Greyfield. She sort of slept halfway up.

""So we dressed her in Mary's house, and Mary had a high tea for them. We had gone up early with ironing boards and steamers and everything that we needed. Mary's wonderful maid, Louisa, was just so darling. She had the ironing board out and was helping iron and was serving coffee.

""John had lost half of his clothes that he was supposed to wear. He had his father's shirt and cufflinks and studs that he wanted to wear. We couldn't find those. My husband, David, was racing up and down Greyfield trying to find those, and finally he did, thank God.

""John was in one room of Mary's house, and the dress designer and the hairdresser were in another room with Carolyn, trying to get her ready. They had done the last fitting, and the dress wouldn't fit. It was just total chaos. The dress designer was Carolyn's longtime friend Narciso Rodriquez with Cerruti 1881 in Paris. He had designed for her a forty-thousand-dollar pearl-colored silk crepe bias-cut gown with silk tulle.""

""We finally got her in her dress,"" Gogo says. ""She traveled on all fours, her hands in the front seat right next to me, while I was driving. Then she was sort of standing up in the back, so that there wouldn't be one wrinkle when she got to the chapel. Of course, she sunk down into the dirt in her beautiful white satin shoes as soon as she stepped out.

""The church was incredible. There was a butler, Efigenio Pinhiero, and a woman, Marta, who basically raised John and his sister, Caroline. They were at the wedding. It was a very well-thought-out group of friends and family who were invited-people who mean a lot to John and Carolyn.

""Effie did the church. I think he used a lot of grapevine. The Park Service would not let him do a lot, once they caught on. But he did have a beautiful arch there. I think he had white morning glories trailing along on the floor. Other than that, it was lit with flashlights. We were allowed one candle up at the front. The Park Service would not let us have any other candles. We had applied for a special-use permit through Greyfield for the use of the church, which has been done several times. I did not want to involve the park just because I knew that would start a wildfire going. And it did. The boat people in the Park Service were the first ones to let the media know what was going on.""

Getting the sixty or so guests among them Teddy Kennedy, Maurice Templesman, one of Jackie Kennedy Onassis's closest friends, John's sister, Caroline Schlossberg, and her kids, Jack, Rose, and Tatiana-from Greyfield to the church ten miles away was another logistical headache. The plan was to transport them in cars and trucks quickly via the smooth, hard-packed beach.

Gogo kept her fingers crossed that the tide would be low enough so the beach would be passable for hauling the guests to the church, then back to Greyfield for the post-wedding festivities,

""In looking ahead, we could see that the tide would be low in the afternoon and would give us time enough to get up the beach and back,"" she says. ""Otherwise, it would have been a four-hour trip getting everyone up to that church and back down again. We drove them up there at low tide and then back at low tide. Thank God.

""We had every means of transportation. I had some Greyfield employees drive some people up and down. Whit Foster drove some people in his pickup truck. And we had all the Chippendale chairs and plastic chairs and everything else in the trucks.

""John and Carolyn were like two hours late for the wedding because of trying to find his clothes and getting her into her dress. People were taking tours of Carol Ruckdeschel's little museum by then and looking for armadillos. Everyone was covered with ticks for weeks afterwards. 

""We finally got to the church, but by then it was so dark that Carol loaned flashlights. The Park Service also had loaned flashlights to light it up. It was by far the most beautiful service.""

Caroline's three-year-old son, Jack, was the ring bearer. He walked down the aisle, sat in the front pew, and piped up, ""Why's Carolyn all dressed up like that?"" 

Caroline, carrying orchids, was matron of honor.

Best man was Anthony Radziwill, John's first cousin.

Readings were by his brother-in-law, Edwin Schlossberg.

Atlanta photographer Denis Reggie, brother of Teddy Kennedy's wife, Vicki Reggie Kennedy, took photos.

Flower girls Rose and Tatiana Schlossberg scattered rose petals on the carpet placed on the worn wooden floor for the wedding.

David Davis, a Baptist choir leader in Fernandina, sang ""Amazing Grace"" as John and Carolyn walked in. They held hands at the altar before the Reverend Charles O'Byrne, a family friend from Manhattan's Church of St. Ignatius Loyola. After John and Carolyn were pronounced man and wife, Davis sang ""Shall the Circle Be Unbroken"" as they walked out of the church.

""I had interviewed many, many people from Jacksonville-all over Jacksonville-people who sing in the choirs,"" Gogo says. ""I just sat on the phone or went over and interviewed a lot of people. We wanted an un-trained voice because there was going to be no musical accompaniment. Mr. Davis was just perfect. He didn't have a clue who was in the wedding. He was shocked when he got over here and I told him that the couple would come and talk to him about what they wanted him to sing. And then John and Carolyn came out, and I thought his jaw was going to drop. He was speechless for the entire afternoon. But it was just wonderful. We couldn't have found anyone better for that.""

Carol Ruckdeschel, an uninvited observer, eyeballed the whole thing from her barn's doorway, where she sat and nursed a beer and munched popcorn. When the ceremony was over, Carolyn, beautiful in her sparkling white gown, daintily stepped over to Carol's fence for a wedding photo. While she smoothed some wrinkles in her gown, she absent-mindedly held up her bouquet in her left hand. She felt a tug-Carol's horse had sauntered over to the fence and decided to make a snack of the wedding bouquet. John, chuckling, went over and petted the horse and said hi to Carol.

The wedding party feasted on capon and seafood at Greyfield after returning from the church. Ted Kennedy toasted the couple: ""I'd like to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. John F. Kennedy."" The newlyweds' first dance was to ""Forever in My Life"" by Prince.

""It was just unbelievable, unbelievable,"" says Gogo.

The next morning, John and Carolyn sailed off on the Kennedy family yacht, Honey Fitz, for their honeymoon in an unknown place.

John issued a statement: ""It was important for us to be able to conduct this in a private, prayerful and meaningful way with the people we love.""

The day after the wedding, word leaked out to the media. All hell truly broke loose then. Writers from every media organization from Time to the National Inquirer were furious that they had been one-upped by Gogo and her allies. In the world of celebrity reporting, stories don't get much bigger than this.

""I would have people calling me from newspapers and magazines say-ing, 'You owe me this interview,"" Gogo says. ""The Atlanta paper said that they were coming the next day with a photographer, and I owed them an interview. I said, 'I don't owe you anything. I'm not interviewing anyone. I did this for John and Carolyn's privacy. So I told them, 'If you come past our gates, you are in violation of trespassing. And then they were found in the living room of Greyfield. I mean, people were just unbelievable.

""The money being offered in St. Marys and Fernandina for charters and for any photographs of any Kennedy-especially John and Carolyn-went up to something like twenty-five thousand dollars. Just watching the flotillas of media trying to get on to this island after the wedding was horrifying. It was horrifying that our privacy could be so violated.

The media used a lot of pictures out of context. There is one magazine that had the kids, Jack and Rose and Tatiana, supposedly at this wed-ding, when in fact it was some wedding way up in the Hamptons that they were photographed at. There were pictures of Greyfield with the dining room fully set for this elegant meal, and it wasn't that at all because our meals were eaten out on the porch and out under the tents. There was a picture in People magazine that was probably two years old. It was taken from a Georgia newspaper article.

There were a lot of consequences. I have gotten a lot of hate mail, a lot of anonymous hate mail. Every environmental group said it was the beginning of the end for Cumberland. The crowds were going to be just unbelievable.

""It's so funny because I never once harped on the opportunity to profit from this or be recognized for this. Yet I am doing a fundraiser for the Department of Natural Resources, and in their brochure, the first thing they do is advertise 'the famous Cumberland Island of the Kennedy wedding. So everyone is jumping on the bandwagon to make some kind of profit off it.

""Right after the wedding, my family had a meeting at Greyfield to discuss what we want from this. And what we wanted to get from this was that our family and our inn are a place of privacy-that no matter who you are, you can come, and you can remain unrecognized and enjoy your-self in total privacy. And I think that we accomplished that. And I think that I will always go down as someone who will always honor people's privacy.""..

While I enjoyed my bottle, It will not be a repeat purchase for me at those prices. Recently I was sipping on Chamucos Anejo and something about it reminded me of 1146. I did a side by side with the remains I had left.

These were my thoughts:

**1146** \- Had sweetness, spices (oregano), minerals, horse manure funk.

**Chamucos** \- Had caramel, vanilla, toffee, coffee, chocolate, wheat, orange zest, sweet funk.

Both had a funky note to them at different spectrums. 1146 was an earthy low tone funk and Chamucos was more delicate sweet bright tone funk (like a Salmiana mezcal). 

If I ask myself would I rather have 2 of Chamucos or 1 of ArteNom 1146 for the price, I choose the Chamucos. The 1146 experience isn't 2x as good to me.

It does seem that if you pass BACK through it the wrong way, it resets, and you get to change direction one more time, but this completely breaks more complex hypertube networks.

This has been broken since 1.1 initial release, and it's still broken now- it make a very cool part of the 1.1 release functionally useless.

I did a methylation test and I was low on a lot of B vitamins and zinc. 
First thing in the morning, brush your teeth with smart mouth with zinc and scrape your tongue 
I start my day with a cup of coffee, no cream, no sugar . (don‚Äôt worry later on I add cream in and I‚Äôm fine but no sugar.)
Breakfast usually is three eggs in the morning then the regimen starts 
All vitamins are gonna be vital nutrition or pure encapsulation mostly 

With Breakfast

Vitamin D3 plus K2 
B complex plus
Zinc 30. I take two capsules.
Vegan B12 dropper form
Supercell superfood
Turmeric, bioperine, garlic ginger three capsules
Moringa 8000 mg

I believe you need to stop the postnasal drip that‚Äôs happening. You may not even realize you have it, but it feeds the bacteria. That‚Äôs what the sea moss with Burdock root does it helps dry you out and stop the mucus. I think this part is very important.

Now for lunch, I don‚Äôt brush my teeth as for vitamins I take
Copper
Selenium (for a week then break for a few days back on ) 
100 billion probiotic( not consistent take a day or two off then back on) 
Oil of oregano 40 mg later I switched to 4000 mg because it came late. I don‚Äôt think it makes a difference.

Above can be taken with dinner or lunch. 

I‚Äôve also suffered with heartburn for about 15 years this cured it. 
B-Supreme !!!!
Like I said in the beginning, a lot of this has to do with your gut and vitamins so if you have heartburn and bad breath, let‚Äôs start here. 
Take this with dinner ( 1 pill) as you‚Äôre eating. it is very fast acting.. Do not take on empty stomach or before you eat take as you‚Äôre eating. From the first time I took it I could tell the difference my stomach was settled no heartburn ever since I‚Äôve been taking it for three weeks. I‚Äôve since come off and I‚Äôm fine. It‚Äôs a game changer. I‚Äôm adding it in this regiment because it may play a part. 

before bed, I take/ with snack

Magnesium glycinate 
Melatonin 5 mg mouth dissolvable. Few times a month

Brush teeth, use, smart, mouth, scraped tongue
I did order the smart mouth mouthwash, but it was on backorder. I am using it now. It is strong. I don‚Äôt think you need it all the stuff above worked in the first night my tongue was clean. No white stuff and mouth taste different.

Also been taking Celtic sea salt, must be that brand ! 
If you wanna go down another rabbit hole, this is good. Celtic sea salt. Sea moss and moringa 
You need these three in your life. Celtic salt is just a pinch every day or every couple days. I take it.

2 weeks in added cream into coffee still fine tongue is pink and clean
Cut back on my sugar intake
No ice cream no milk yet . 

Recap, I think it‚Äôs about the vitamins gut health and zinc! 

First day I doubled up on the zinc in my second week. I‚Äôm dropping down to one a day.

1lxes3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/boba/comments/1lxes3a/rankings_and_thoughts_on_50_boba_shops_that_ive/,Rankings and thoughts on 50+ boba shops that I‚Äôve tried,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share a list of the boba shops that I‚Äôve tried in the last few years and my thoughts on them. Unfortunately, some of these entries are not as detailed (as I only started taking detailed notes in the last year). 

Methodology: I almost always get milk tea (black/jasmine) with 0% sugar and boba. I think this makes sense for a few reasons, as 1) it promotes consistency across the places I‚Äôm comparing, 2) sweetness can be used to mask poor quality milk tea/boba, and 3) it‚Äôs the healthiest way to enjoy your boba.

A lot of places‚Äô quality can vary depending on the location and who‚Äôs working, so I‚Äôve included the location of each shop I‚Äôve been to. My rating is of the best drink I‚Äôve had from each location/store, and I‚Äôll try to note if I find consistency to be poor. The list is sorted by my score and then alphabetical order. Ultimately, I want to disclaim that this list is all just the opinion of one guy and my memory is not perfect when it comes to the places I‚Äôve tried. 

If you‚Äôre interested in following along, I also have an IG (@tlee6543) where I like posting stories with pictures and thoughts of the boba shops that I try!

50 Lan (Taiwan) - This is what sets the bar for Taiwan‚Äôs boba for me. The boba is very chewy with top-tier bounce; it‚Äôs standard sized, more white-colored, and not the most textured inside. The milk tea is very well balanced - seems biased towards tea but goes down smooth. Ratios and value are great. Sure, some might find this basic. And you could call this the McDonalds of boba in Taiwan - it was dead consistent across all 5+ locations I‚Äôve tried - but the price and quality tell a different story. 8/10

Bubble U (LA) - Small shop in Chinatown LA that surprised me in a good way. Very creamy milk tea. Chewy boba with good texture. Great ratios overall. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt take many notes at the time and I‚Äôve only tried this once but it was very good. 8/10

Nap Tea Da‚Äôan (Taiwan) - Blew me away when I tried this location. Milk tea is slightly biased towards creaminess albeit still maintaining a strong tea flavor. Boba is top-tier; super chewy, lots of texture, and a caramel-esque sweetness. Great ratios. This might be the best boba I‚Äôve tried - I‚Äôd give it an 8/10 but honestly, it probably deserves higher. However, I was equally blown away when I tried their other location in Taipei and it was so bad I just chucked the drink half-drank. 

TP Tea (Bay Area) - Milk tea has good kick and balance. Boba is on the smaller side which detracts slightly from chewing experience but lends to perception of more quantity, and there‚Äôs a unique sweetness. Good ratio of milk tea to boba. Tastes unique, unlike anything else I‚Äôve tried in the US or elsewhere in a good way. Very consistent across all locations in the Bay Area. 8/10

Kung Fu Tea (Taiwan) - Not sure I‚Äôd trust US Kung Fu Tea‚Äôs but this one, at least, was excellent. The milk tea is slightly bitter the way I like it; however, it‚Äôs quickly offset/balanced by a slight excess of sugar from the boba. Boba is standard sized with great chew and texture. Ratios are expectedly excellent for boba in Taiwan. 7.5/10

Ah Ma Handmade (Shanghai) - Milk tea is top-tier - super creamy and lots of flavor. Boba is more of an acquired taste; it has a chunky texture to it but I wouldn't say it's bad either. Enjoyed this one a lot, as it tastes unique in a good way. 7/10

Asha Tea House (SF) - Tastes quite reminiscent of Boba Guy‚Äôs formula and wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this is where they got their inspiration. Strong, creamy milk tea and boba with a lot of texture to it and that same aftertaste as Boba Guy‚Äôs boba. Solid ratios overall. Tried the Berkeley location and didn‚Äôt find it to be as good. 7/10

Boba Guys (Bay Area) - Overrated, or are they? This is one of the first spots that made me think ‚Äúdamn that‚Äôs some quality boba‚Äù as a kid. I‚Äôve drunk hundreds of milk teas from Boba Guys over the years. The milk tea has both good creaminess and punch. Boba has fantastic internal texture, in particular, and chew. I would say there‚Äôs a strong argument for this being some of my favorite boba; it has a lot of character to it, as do the drinks in general. However, Boba Guy‚Äôs drinks are hit or miss depending on the location and who‚Äôs working. 7/10

Cha Cha Go (San Jose) - Milk tea is slightly sweet even at 0% sugar. Plenty of kick and cream to the milk tea. Boba is extremely chewy with plenty of texture. There‚Äôs not much to say about this other than it was very good. 7/10

Chi Cha San Chen (California, NY, Singapore) - I would describe this as ‚Äògenerically excellent‚Äô. The milk tea is strong and biased toward the milk for a more creamy flavor. The boba has lots of chew and a nice aftertaste but I don‚Äôt find the texture inside to be the best. It‚Äôs a bit too gelatinous at most of the locations I‚Äôve tried which juxtaposes unfavorably with the thicker milk tea and contributes to a lack of character. Ratios are good. Yeah, it goes down smooth, but not enough to mask the sting of the $9 price tag. 7/10

Guji (Taiwan) - I would describe this as a more ‚Äòmature‚Äô version of 50 Lan. It all tastes very similar, down to the pearls themselves. However, Guji‚Äôs milk tea tastes slightly sharper from memory, wherein I‚Äôd prefer a more creamy milk tea. Great ratio of milk tea to boba. 7/10

KOI (Singapore, Japan, China) - This reminds me a lot of 50 LAN in that it tastes quite consistent across the 5+ locations I‚Äôve had it in Asia. The milk tea is nothing to scoff at with a nice hint of sweetness that comes in from the boba. Pearls are on the smaller side with lots of chew. I would say this is a ‚Äòsafe‚Äô option but in a damn good way. 7/10

Odd One Out Tea (LA) - This place should really be called Poors Out because it's $10 for a basic milk tea. Anyways, I see this as a heavier take on TP Tea - there's added cream foam, the boba's similarly on the slightly smaller side but sweeter with good chew. I have to admit it's pretty good, but TP Tea's almost half the price and still tastes better. Plus it's a little too sweet even at 0% sugar for me. 7/10

Silk. (Hong Kong) - Very different type of milk tea than anything else I‚Äôve tried. It almost has an edge to it despite what they call their milk tea but not in a bad way. It has to be tried to be understood. Boba is top-tier with tons  of chew and a great ratio of milk tea to boba. 7/10 

Sunright Tea Studio (California) - Solid milk tea with good amounts of both cream to the milk and punch to the tea. The boba is standard sized and freshly warm; letting it cool adds some needed structure for chew to it. I‚Äôve tried many locations across CA; generally I find this to be one of the better boba chains but not all locations are created equal. 7/10

Tiger Tea and Juice (Burlingame) - Pleasantly surprised by this one. Milk tea is solid if lacking some character behind it. The boba is the real star of the show - very chewy with excellent texture that‚Äôs somewhat reminiscent of Boba Guy‚Äôs boba. Ratio of milk tea to boba is solid. San Mateo location was significantly worse. 7/10

Wushiland Boba (LA) - This is basically the American version of 50 Lan. It does taste different - my guess is they use different milk in the milk tea. The boba is also different; it‚Äôs a standard black and doesn‚Äôt have as much perkiness to it. I don‚Äôt think it stacks up to the lofty heights of its Taiwanese counterpart. Regardless, this is a very solid choice of boba milk tea and the ratio of boba to milk tea is off the charts. 7/10

Chagee (China) - Chagee is like a good baseline for milk tea in Asia, they usually have a crazy long line. The tea is good, albeit I find the milk is pretty forgettable and they don't have boba either. They do 0% sugar well and the straw style makes you take your time with the drink. 6.5/10

HeyTea (Singapore, Bay Area) - The milk tea here is great - very fragrant, creamy, and smooth. I like the milk foam as well, there's a slight saltiness that contrasts nicely. The boba is hit or miss depending on location. Generally seems overcooked and clumps together with not much chew. Ratio of boba to milk tea and value are also hit or miss. Very popular chain in Asia but wouldn't usually be my first pick. 6.5/10

Ming Cha (LA) - The jasmine tea here is very fragrant and has a lot of flavor behind it; the same goes for the honey in the pearls. I‚Äôm a fan of the flavor profile. In terms of texture, the pearls could be better - they have a slight chunkiness to them wherein I‚Äôd prefer more chew. The ratio of milk tea to boba is solid. This reminds me a lot of Ah Ma‚Äôs Handmade Tea in China. 6.5/10

N Draft Tea and Coffee (San Jose) - Lots of kick to the tea (I think they put a shot of caffeine in it or something?) and tastes fresh. Good ratio of milk to tea. Boba is above average with good chew and bounce. Ratio of boba to milk tea could be better. Pretty solid overall. 6.5/10

Seven Leaves (California) - Boba here is really good - lots of chew, great texture. Milk tea is just decent and the lack of a zero sugar option is rough. All their drinks have 20+ grams of sugar and are overly sweet. Ratio of boba to milk tea is good. I think this is a solid option if you like your milk tea sweet, though. 6.5/10

1011 Sip Tea (SF) - Smooth tasting milk tea that‚Äôs of decent quality. Boba is chewy and bouncy with less internal texture. Seems to be hit or miss depending on the day. 6/10

3Cat (LA) - I would say the boba here is definitely up there in terms of quality. The milk tea, however, is strongly biased towards the tea. It's a tad bitter for me, probably way too bitter for most people at 0% sugar. Overall, this is fine but something of an acquired taste in terms of the milk tea. 6/10

Bako Tea House (Irvine) - Don‚Äôt remember much other than that this was decent. 6/10

Black Sugar Boba Bar (SF) - 6/10

Boba Binge (Oakland) - Tea has a slight, pleasant aftertaste (almost an oaty, coffee-esque one) and is fresh. Pearls are good. 6/10

Boba Bliss (Bay Area) - The milk tea here is very fresh tasting and with good kick; no complaints. However, the boba is soft in an overcooked manner and tastes like the generic type. Ratio of boba to milk tea is great. 6/10

Bobaville (SF) - Coffee-esque aftertaste to the tea. Pearls are smaller and seem homemade. 6/10

By Me Boba Tea (SF) - 6/10

Chun Shui Tang (Taiwan) - This is often referred to as the birthplace of boba milk tea. I found the milk tea to be quite frothy and lacking in impact. The boba is on the smaller side with a slightly harder internal texture. Yes, I would say this boba milk tea tastes unique but not necessarily in a good way. Going here is mostly just to say you‚Äôve tried it. 6/10

Coco (San Jose) - Boba has great chew with a slightly smoothed internal texture. Milk tastes lower fat and smooth; tea could use some more bite. Very smooth drink overall and decent boba to tea ratio. Honestly, this might be the best boba in Valley Fair despite looking like the most generic boba shop there. 6/10

Lady Luck Cafe (SF) - Portion is quite small for the price, but solid flavor and quality overall. 6/10

LATEA (LA) - Boba here is handmade which reflects in the inconsistent size of the individual pearls. Texture and chew are good and like conventional boba. Milk tea is decent if slightly watered. Ratio of boba to milk tea is good. Overall, this is a solid drink but it doesn't particularly stand out in a sea of other, better options. 6/10

Molly Tea (San Jose) - I would say the milk tea here is pretty similar to what you'd get at like Chagee. It's great tea with lots of flavor and kick but the milk itself is pretty unremarkable. Personally I find the lowest sweetness to still be too much and I don't like that they don't have boba either. 6/10

Omomo (LA) - This is one of the most hyped boba shops in LA. Generally, I find their milk tea and matcha itself to be of good quality. However, the boba itself leaves desiring - it‚Äôs softer even when you let the ice cool it and add some structure, and it generally tastes generic. Decent drinks overall but certainly not something I‚Äôd go out of my way for. 6/10

R&B Tea (SJ) -  Pricey, but high-quality overall. Ice cubes are a bit small, which is annoying. 6/10

Seven Tea (Taiwan) - Milk tea has a slightly ""baked"" taste to it, likely from the milk, tastes decent. Boba is good but not great - the outside texture was a little rough. Good ratio of milk to tea. Not much to complain about, but not my favorite either (esp the milk tea). 6/10

Sweet Moment (San Mateo) - 6/10

The Alley (Irvine) - Milk tea was solid but boba was slightly undercooked and hard in the center. Good ratios all-round. I think this could be ranked higher if they‚Äôd cooked the boba correctly. If you get sugar (they only had drinks with sugar at their soft opening in Berkeley), it‚Äôs disgustingly sweet. 6/10

Tong Sui (Redwood City) - Really nice milk tea - fresh and fragrant but in a lighter way. The boba itself tastes more generic and can be hit or miss depending on the day. I liked this a lot the first time (went when they opened and it was fresh) but I felt like it kept getting worse depending on the time because very few people order boba here, so they don‚Äôt turn over the boba when they should. 6/10

Tea Hee (San Jose) - Tea is quite strong with a fresh taste to the milk as well. Boba is soft and chewy without clumping apart when chewed. Not my preference but I like it. Good ratio of boba to milk tea. 6/10

Ten REN‚Äôs Tea Time (SF) - 6/10

Ume Tea (San Jose) - The milk tea has both a good creaminess and flavor from the tea. It‚Äôs slightly sweet even at 0% sugar, possibly from excess sugar coating the boba. Boba itself is warm and chewy while lacking some internal texture. I‚Äôd prefer more structure. Overall portion is a bit small but the drink is good overall. 6/10

Urban Ritual (Bay Area) - Usually this is pretty good. I think the milk tea and boba both tend to be a little bit above average. Their cr√®me br√ªl√©e is actually pretty good for a sweeter drink. 6/10

Wanpo (Bay Area) - I would say this is some of the best non-dairy milk tea that I‚Äôve had; it‚Äôs not particularly watered like you‚Äôd usually find with non-dairy and the tea has good kick. The boba itself has good chew and internal texture and, depending on the day/location, is very good. Ratios overall are good. 6/10

Chun Yang (LA) - Milk tea appears to be visually biased towards the milk but I don't actually find it to be that creamy. It's slightly more watery than it looks. Boba has a ""ricey"" taste to it, but has good chew - it's fine. Good ratios, decent overall. 5.5/10

Happy Lemon (Bay Area) - 5.5/10

HeChaLou (LA) - Surprisingly decent for a boba shop attached to a supermarket. Milk tea's pretty strong. Boba's not the best but also not bad. Best way I can describe the boba is that it's a bit generic but it's cooked well. Solid ratios and price. 5.5/10

Honeybear Boba (SF) - Pretty vanilla tasting all-round. Tea could benefit from more kick; nothing stands out about pearls for better or worse. Adequate pearls to tea ratio. 5.5/10

Mr. Sun (Palo Alto) - Excellent chew to boba although it's lacking in internal texture; outside has homemade inconsistencies between pearls. Average tea with OK kick; good quantity of boba. 5.5/10

Plentea (SF) - The milk tea here is alright with a slightly sour aftertaste likely stemming from the milk that overshadowed the green tea. The boba itself was chewy but with a more chunky texture when broken down. Decent ratios and comes in a glass container which is cool. 5.5/10 

TrueDan (Japan, Taiwan) - I‚Äôve tried this in both Japan and Taiwan. The milk tea is generally good. However, I find the boba to be pretty overcooked. There‚Äôs poor chew and texture. The ratio of boba to milk tea is good. 5.5/10 

Bobalicious (Redwood City) - Tastes powdered and artificial. All the positive Yelp reviews for this place are not accurate at all. Can‚Äôt see how anyone who‚Äôs tried quality boba would like this place. 5/10

Bober Tea (Walnut Creek) - Mostly remember this had very disappointing portion size for the price. Boba was overcooked and kind of goopy. 5/10

Brian Black Tea (Bay Area) - Very watered milk tea - not enough milk and what tea‚Äôs there lacks bite. Boba is warm, plentiful, and decent albeit ultimately lacking texture. Not really seeing the appeal of this place overall, though. 5/10

Chapresso (LA) - Pretty average all-round - boba was slightly overcooked and boring to chew, milk tea was slightly watered through, and they forgot to add ice the first time. Only thing not average here is the $7.25 price tag lmao. 5/10

Ding Tea (LA) - 5/10

Foam (SF) - 5/10

Gong Cha (Bay Area, South Korea) - Straight average from the tea to the pearls. Pretty much tastes similar at every location I‚Äôve tried. Sure, it‚Äôs consistent but why bother in a sea of better options. 5/10

Heuk Hwa Dang (LA) - don‚Äôt remember much about this one other than that it was pretty mediocre. 5/10

It‚Äôs Boba Time (Los Angeles) - The location I tried had good reviews on Google Maps but I don‚Äôt buy it. Tasted suspiciously like powdered milk tea and the boba was undercooked and slightly hard in the center. 5/10

Just Boba (Taiwan) - This was one of the first boba shops I tried in Taiwan because I trusted the Google reviews and it was near the Shilin night market. This tasted watered through and the boba also overly gelatinous. Turns out they give you a free drink if you leave a Google review so the ratings are massively inflated. 5/10 

Purple Kow (SF) - This place is SWEET, 0% sugar literally tastes like 30-60% sugar at a normal place. I don't know where they're sourcing their milk but the sweetness is almost entirely off of that. The boba itself is decent - on the smaller side like TP Tea's but not with the best texture IMO. They don't skimp on the boba at least but it's just way too sweet for me to come close to finishing this anyways. 5/10

Pitstop Boba (SF) - Cool that this place is attached to some random gas station on the way up to the city. Average tasting tea and pearls although it seemed fresh. 5/10

PurTea (SF) - Milk tea is pretty decent, could use some more creaminess to the milk - tastes like a non-dairy one. Boba is completely average and tastes like the generic type all the shops use. Pretty average overall and just another case of SF boba. 5/10

Little Sweet (SF) - Tea tastes too watered down and the bobai s decidedly average in terms of texture and chew. Tea to boba ratio is below-average as well. 5/10

Lucky Tea (Taiwan) - See above story with Just Boba because it all applies here. 5/10 

Milk Tea Labs (SF) - 5/10

Rabbit Rabbit Tea (San Jose) - Average tea that could use more kick; pearls have good bounce and chew. Value for the amount of drink you're getting is an affront to the wallet in any event. 5/10

Rare Tea (San Mateo) - Tea tasted watered down, maybe not enough milk. Boba had little tactility and broke apart quickly when chewing. 5/10

Rose Tea Lounge (Fremont) - Milk tea tastes watered through; plenty of kick to the tea but not enough milk. Boba is mostly just average and doesn't really have much honey to it. 5/10

Share tea (San Mateo) - Quality has dropped over time. Pearls seem lower quality; somewhat goopy and lack structure which is exacerbated by small size. Tea tastes watered down. 5/10

Teado Tea Shop (New York) - Tea was fresh and had good bite, but the milk wasn't very creamy. Boba was pretty meh. Too small to actually chew much and didn't have wow factor. Just a very average tasting place overall. 5/10

Tea Maru (LA) - Felt like the milk tea was a little watered, might be the milk itself. Boba seems handmade - has a unique texture to it when you bite through, almost like a fruit gummy. Pretty small amount of drink for the price. 5/10

Teaspoon (Bay Area) - Pearls are usually warm and they have good chew but can come across re-heated in terms of texture (a bit chunky). Pretty vanilla experience for the most part. 5/10

Wonderful Foods (SF) - Milk tea is heavily watered down and tastes like it has no cream. Boba is decidedly average; boba to milk tea ratio is fine. 5/10

Xin Fu Tang (Singapore) - Pearls were freshly warm, but too gooey in texture even accounting for the ice adding some structure. Something I dislike about this shop is that there is no zero sweetness option; it‚Äôs way too sweet even with the lowest option. 5/10

Yi Dian Dian (Los Angeles) - Basically the water of boba? The boba's well-cooked with a lot of chew but there's like zero sugar to it. Milk tea's not watered through, and I can tell there's milk, it's just not creamy at all. Just almost zero flavor to this all-round. 5/10

Yifang Taiwan (SF) - Disappointingly average for a Taiwan originating chain. 5/10

Bopomofo Cafe (Los Angeles) - this place was highly rated but the pic kinda speaks for itself. The milk tea was watered through, and the boba was slightly overcooked and clung to each other. Popcorn chicken was booty too. Solid 4/10 all-round.

Dots (SF) - Milk tea is completely watered through (and you could see it just from pictures) and the tea is weak to top it off. Boba is average quality but the ratio of boba to milk tea is egregiously poor. Standard SF boba affair. 4/10

Quickly (Redwood City) - Milk tea tastes powdered. 4/10

Tan Cha (San Mateo) - Boba tastes overcooked and lacks texture. Tea is decidedly average and sweetness from boba mixes undesirably. Tea to boba ratio is below average. 4/10

Tea It Up (Menlo Park) - Extremely watered through tea. 4/10

TPumps (Foster City) - 4/10

Zero& (San Jose) - & it's pretty meh. Boba was slightly undercooked (on the harder side) and tastes generic. Same goes for the milk tea - tastes unremarkable. Boba quantity is lacking a lot (and the pic speaks for itself here). 4/10

Mojo‚Äôs Asian Fusion Cafe (Isla Vista) - Exactly the type of boba you‚Äôd expect to find in Santa Barbara. Clunky boba with awful taste and mediocre milk tea. 3/10

So I guess this is the n-th attempt of mine, at my own intro, confused about who I am suddenly, even thoo I have been in this body for 30 years??

Let's start with that, I guess. HEY, I just turned 30 (still bringing my head around it) ü•π. If you see me in real life you'd feel I look a child in an adult body. I do think I am old-soul.. or a bit too serious for some people's taste.

I also got married couple months back, sooo, I'd say I am just trying to get accustomed to all the changes around me. And I'd say I am here because I'd like to be a part of a girl community? Somewhere we can have genuine convos and support each other through it? I don't feel or ever felt lonely, I feel we all have to be comfy in our own skin and it's ok if no one's really around.

I only use it for espresso and don't care about any other type of drink really. Is there a machine under $250 that's worth it in your experience (especially with the Prime Day discounts)?

I consistently strength train for 5 days/week with a PT, back-chest-legs-shoulders-arms split. Other than that I mostly have a desk job but try to get 5K steps. No cardio.

Here is the diet she gave me for weight loss:

* 40gms oats, 1/2 scoop whey, 30gms mixed berries, 1 tbsp pumpkin seeds, 5 almonds, 200ML 2% reduced fat milk for breakfast.
* 100gms chicken breast, 60gms boiled white rice, 5gm olive oil, 1 cucumber and 1 greek yoghurt 150gms plain for both lunch and dinner.
* Low fat ricotta cheese and 1/2 scoop whey with some coffee for snack.

Now this is okay but not as colorful as I‚Äôd like. So I made my variant:

* 120ML 2% milk, 5g butter, 2 whole eggs, 2 whole wheat bread slices for breakfast
* 120ML 2% milk, 3 almonds, 30gms mixed berries, 40gm steel cut oats, 1/2 scoop whey, 75g apple slices, 6g ground flex seeds for lunch
* 62gm low fat ricotta cheese, 1/2 scoop whey and 1/2 apple slice for snack
* 12gm chia seeds, 6 egg whites, 150gm greek non fat yoghurt, 30gm mixed berries, 140gm sauteed veggies, 5gm olive oil, 1/2 scoop whey for dinner.

I‚Äôm taking Vit-B supplements and creatine in the mornings.

Realistically, this is still about 1450 calories that puts me in a deficit but is it too good to be true? Am I covering all micronutrients and ensuring I‚Äôm in a good deficit?

Alright. So.... I'm not a fan of vanilla romance. I decluttered it awhile go and same with Viva Vanilla. I just don't vibe with the woodsy vanillas for some reason. These flankers still piqued my interest, though!

Starting with Vanilla Cafe....hmmmm. Its definitely a creamy, nutty, slightly coffee scent. The FFM smells like a more nutty, caramel-y, version of Vanilla Romance. The lotion and body wash smell more true to their notes. I don't really feel this scent is for me, though. Its a bit cloying on my skin and I cant picture me reaching for it very often. Will probably return üòñ.

Now, Vanilla Ease?! Amazing. I LOVE THIS. It is so delicate and pretty. I feel like the packaging and name fit the scent so well and I feel like this scent could be great during the day or before bed. It doesn't smell like the lavender+Vanilla Aromatherapy line, either....That one smells like diapers to me. This is just so good. The initial scent is very lavender foward and dries down to a really subtle, sweet, Vanilla. Like...if someone placed some lavender sprigs on top of some whipped vanilla cream.

Despite VC not working for me, I still think this launch is very interesting and I like how there are options for different scent preferences ü•∞.",25,1752258379.0,bathandbodyworks,14,1.0,False

The KitchenAid KCM1208DG Drip Coffee Maker immediately struck me with its sleek appearance. The matte grey finish gives it a modern and understated edge that looks great on any countertop. I placed it next to my toaster, and it almost seemed like they belonged in an art exhibit. Beyond just looks, its design is practical too. The removable water tank is a lifesaver when it‚Äôs time to refill‚Äîit slides off effortlessly and eliminates the awkwardness of pouring water into tight spaces. The accompanying dosage chart etched into the tank is a subtle yet handy touch, helping me brew the perfect strength every time.

**Produces Exceptionally Flavorful Coffee**

Brew quality is where this machine truly shines. Featuring a 29-hole spiral showerhead, it ensures that water is evenly distributed over the coffee grounds for optimal flavor extraction. I experimented with both regular and bold settings, and I could clearly taste the depth of flavor this feature brings out. It‚Äôs also forgiving if you‚Äôre experimenting with different coffee blends, as the customizable brewing options adapt well to different grind sizes and roasts. My partner, who prefers darker blends, could vouch for this after one taste test.

[Ready to snag KitchenAid KCM1208DG? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07rqn3vvl/)

**Programmability That Fits Any Lifestyle**

Its programmability is a godsend for individuals like me who crave coffee the moment we wake up. The 24-hour programming feature lets you set the machine to have your coffee ready whenever you need it, day or night. There were days I had a 5 AM alarm, and waking up to find my brew waiting? Bliss. This touch makes mornings infinitely smoother.

**Key Pros**

- Ensures even saturation of coffee grounds with a 29-hole spiral showerhead.
- Comes with a programmable warming plate to keep coffee hot for up to two hours.
- Large, clear water tank with dosage measurements simplifies brewing.
- Stylish matte grey appearance blends beautifully into modern kitchens.

**Some Downsides**

- The machine feels a bit bulky at times, taking up more counter space than expected.  
- Cleaning the gold-tone filter requires a bit more care compared to disposable filters.  

**Pause and Pour Feature Adds Convenience**

What‚Äôs more comforting than sneaking in a mid-brew cup? The pause and pour feature has been one of my favorites. I‚Äôve tested this multiple times and didn‚Äôt experience any drips or mess. It‚Äôs especially handy during family breakfasts when our table buzzes with impatient coffee drinkers.

**Peer Products**

While evaluating this coffee maker, I also looked into competitors like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. What sets KitchenAid apart is its thoughtful design and precision brewing capabilities. The Cuisinart offers a deeper carafe but lacks the even saturation provided by KitchenAid‚Äôs spiral showerhead. On the other hand, Hamilton Beach excels in versatility but doesn't deliver the same consistency in flavor. If you prioritize design and taste, this model holds its own against its rivals.

**Bang for the Buck**

Given all its features‚Äîlike programmability, consistent brew strength, and thoughtful design‚ÄîI‚Äôd consider the overall price reasonable. You‚Äôre not just paying for a functional appliance; you‚Äôre investing in one that adds convenience and style to your routine. Compared to models in a similar range, this one feels like a more premium choice where quality and performance combine.

>

At¬†**letstravail**, we‚Äôve introduced a simple but game-changing concept into your itinerary:  
üéØ Timeboxing your travel day.

# üí° What Is Timeboxing in Travel?

Timeboxing means assigning¬†**a specific time slot**¬†or¬†**estimated duration**¬†to each stop in your itinerary ‚Äî just like you would block time for meetings in your calendar.

Instead of vague plans like ‚ÄúVisit Mysore Palace sometime in the afternoon,‚Äù you‚Äôll see:

üïí¬†**12:00 PM ‚Äî 1:30 PM**: Explore Mysore Palace  
üïí¬†**1:30 PM ‚Äî 2:30 PM**: Lunch break nearby  
üïí¬†**3:00 PM ‚Äî 4:00 PM**: Drive to Chamundi Hills + visit

It‚Äôs not about rushing ‚Äî it‚Äôs about¬†**realistic pacing and smart expectations**.

# ‚úÖ Why Timeboxing Works So Well

* üß†¬†**Keeps Your Day Balanced** No more cramming 8 spots into 5 hours. You‚Äôll see clearly what fits and what doesn‚Äôt.
* üö´¬†**Prevents Overplanning** Travelers often underestimate commute time or the energy a place requires. Timeboxing builds in space for breathing, eating, and navigating.
* üîÑ¬†**Flexible Yet Structured** You can always move time blocks ‚Äî but having them helps you stay focused and relaxed.

# üìç How letstravail Uses Timeboxing

When you generate an itinerary on¬†[letstravail.com](https://letstravail.com/), our system:

1. Estimates¬†**travel time**¬†between each location
2. Assigns¬†**ideal durations**¬†for visits (based on type: monument, food, trek, etc.)
3. Adds¬†**buffer slots**¬†for meals, rest, and local exploration
4. Avoids crowd-pileups by suggesting¬†**time-of-day preferences**

>

# üß≠ Real-World Example: Coorg Weekend Trip

Instead of rushing through 6 places, the itinerary focused on 3:

* üïí 9:00 AM ‚Äî 11:00 AM: Abbey Falls
* üïí 12:00 PM ‚Äî 1:30 PM: Local Kodava Lunch
* üïí 3:00 PM ‚Äî 5:00 PM: Coffee Estate Walk

Each stop was calm, unrushed, and fully enjoyable ‚Äî thanks to smart timeboxing.

# üåü Bonus: It Feels Like a Personal Concierge

Timeboxing removes mental fatigue. No more asking:

* ‚ÄúDo we have enough time for this?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúAre we late?‚Äù

Your plan flows. Your day breathes. Your energy is spent on the experience ‚Äî not logistics.

# üöÄ What‚Äôs Coming Next

We‚Äôre working on:

* Visual Timebox Timelines
* Drag-and-drop reordering of blocks
* Alerts when your plan is running over or under time

# üß≥ Final Word

Letstravail isn‚Äôt just about what you see ‚Äî it‚Äôs about¬†**when**¬†and¬†**how**¬†you experience it.  
Timeboxing helps us turn lists into lived moments ‚Äî so every stop, sunset, and sip of chai has room to happen.

1lxebak,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lxebak/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_by_peach_street/,Explore the Best Electric Kettle by Peach Street Is It Worth It,"Using the Peach Street PE-1302 electric kettle has become a part of my daily routine, and let me tell you, this thing can whip up a boiling cup of water faster than I thought possible. I often find myself rushing in the mornings, needing that quick caffeine fix, and this 1.7-liter water boiler has proved itself a lifesaver with its 1500-watt power and rapid heating element. The glowing blue LED light is not just for aesthetics‚Äîit gives off this calm vibe, letting me know my water's coming to life. For a product that's sitting on the counter every single day, I‚Äôve learned to appreciate the little touches like its borosilicate glass body. It doesn't just look fancy but gives off an assurance of durability and easy maintenance.

**Ease of Use and Safety Measures**  
Making a cup of coffee or tea shouldn't feel like a science experiment. Thankfully, this electric kettle simplifies the whole process. From the 360¬∞ rotating base to the automatic shut-off, everything feels intuitive. My teenager, notorious for forgetting appliances on, might actually find this foolproof. Auto shut-off kicks in the moment the water boils, so there's no endless boiling or risk of a kitchen disaster. Plus, the handle stays cool despite the interior heating up rapidly. This means no accidental burns when I'm in a sleepy fog. A hidden bonus? It keeps unwelcome toxins out, thanks to its concealed heating element.

**Fast and Efficient Boiling**  
Speed ranks high for me with appliances, and this kettle delivers on that front. Heating 1.7 liters of water, whether it‚Äôs for my herbal teas or a quick cup of ramen, has never been this fast. Mornings can feel less rushed when you know hot water is ready in minutes‚Äînot to mention late-night tea cravings are easier to satisfy too. I also noticed that even with frequent daily use, the device doesn't seem to slow down. It‚Äôs still boiling with all the vigor of day one.

**Perks**  
- Fast boiling time‚Äîperfect for busy mornings.  
- High safety standards with auto shut-off and boil-dry protection.  
- Durable borosilicate glass and stainless steel construction.  
- Cool-touch handle for safe pouring.  
- LED light adds style and practical visualization for boiling.  

[Check Peach Street PE-1302 price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b0b2q7n54s/)

**Design and Ergonomics**  
Kitchen appliances that blend functionality with style always get a bonus. Sitting on the counter, this kettle has garnered a few compliments for its pristine borosilicate glass and stainless steel combo. It feels modern without being over the top. The lid pops open with a simple button press, and the wide mouth opening makes cleaning less of a chore‚Äînot to mention filling it up is super quick. The built-in mesh filter also adds value for someone like me who enjoys a hint of fruit or loose tea leaves in hot water. However, there is a slight caution: pouring with the lid open isn‚Äôt advisable‚Äîit can get messy.

**Shortcomings**  
- The lid's locking mechanism doesn‚Äôt feel as sturdy as the rest of the unit.  
- While it‚Äôs cordless when off the base, the cord slot on the base seems a bit small for neat wrapping.

**Rotary Base and Cord Storage**  
Convenience with appliances like these goes beyond just boiling. Having a base that rotates 360¬∞ means I can grab this kettle from any angle‚Äîlazy afternoon tea sessions on the couch are way easier. Another nice touch is the cord storage. I was initially surprised that they even thought of adding this, but it does keep things tidy on the countertop. Still, I feel the storage slot could be slightly larger, especially for thicker cords.

**Materials and Durability**  
Durability is always a question with glass products, but the borosilicate glass used here feels robust. It doesn‚Äôt just look clean and classy; it also resists staining despite heavy use with all sorts of beverages. Having a mix of brushed stainless steel alongside it guarantees that this product doesn‚Äôt just break down after months of continual use. I do handwash it as per its instructions‚Äîprobably helps in keeping it looking new longer.

**Competing Products**  
While this glass electric kettle excels in numerous areas, it‚Äôs inevitable to compare it with a competitor like the Cosori Electric Gooseneck Kettle. The Cosori might have an edge for pour-over coffee enthusiasts given its precise spout design, but it trades this off for a smaller capacity. On the other hand, the Peach Street PE-1302 offers a good balance between speed, capacity, and design. Another standout opponent is the Hamilton Beach 1.7L Glass Kettle, which is quite similar in design but doesn‚Äôt feel as stylish or durable as this one. In terms of safety features, Peach Street easily keeps up and, in some cases, surpasses them.

**Quality for Price**  
This isn't the cheapest model on the market, but I‚Äôd place it firmly in the ""worth the price"" category. Comparable products might be slightly cheaper, but they're often lacking the sophisticated combination of rapid boiling, sturdy materials, and practical features like auto shut-off. Spending a tiny bit more for a product like this seems like a smart long-term choice, especially when you consider just how frequently it gets used in a day.

She‚Äôs independent for the most part, but needs assistance for things like finances. She works, but has a maximum she can earn due to her benefits situation that I won‚Äôt be getting into here. 

Because of that, she has extremely little leftover money each month. And by extremely little I mean none. If she does have an extra $10, she uses it to buy things for her cat. Ellie is incredibly thoughtful and kind as a human being. 

My husband (also late 20s) and I have a little extra money each month, and we decided we would give some of that to Ellie so she can have a little fun. We give the money to her in the form of a gift card, usually to her grocery store, a coffee shop, or something else she likes to go to and do, like the movies. Unfortunately we don‚Äôt live close to each other so we can‚Äôt take her to do these things in person. 

We chose to do this without telling our parents because we‚Äôre all adults and, we confirmed, it wouldn‚Äôt impact her benefits situation. This has been going on for about 8 months now. 

My mom (my parents are divorced) found out about it somehow, however, and went ballistic. She called to say she was extremely insulted we would go behind her back to ‚Äúparent‚Äù Ellie. She said we were implying she was a bad mom, and that we had no right to involve ourselves in Ellie‚Äôs financial life. We were shocked to say the least, and tried to explain it was just a little money ($50-$100 a month at most) because we love Ellie, not because we were trying to undermine her. For the record, my mom is not very heavily involved in Ellie‚Äôs life. She does help with some logistical needs around her benefits, but my dad does most of the work, and my mom doesn‚Äôt support her financially at all.

1lxe94a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lxe94a/discover_if_the_oxo_brew_single_serve_coffee/,Discover if the OXO Brew Single Serve Coffee Maker Delivers Perfection Review,"The OXO 11180100 Brew Single Serve Pour-Over Coffee Maker has become a frequent companion in my coffee-brewing routine. As someone who values both simplicity and the nuanced flavors of a good pour-over, this product intrigued me from the get-go. It‚Äôs marketed as a convenient way to prepare a high-quality cup of coffee without requiring barista-level expertise. After a couple of weeks of testing it out‚Äîmornings before work, lazy weekends, and even an on-the-go brewing session‚ÄîI have a lot to share about its features and performance.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker has a sleek, compact build that fits effortlessly on a kitchen counter or even in an office space. Its dimensions‚Äî5.25""D x 5.25""W x 5.25""H‚Äîmean it's petite, yet functional, making it ideal for smaller kitchens or travel. The white color adds an aesthetic, minimalistic appeal, but I did notice it shows stains more easily. Being dishwasher safe, though, cleaning it was surprisingly easy. Every piece, from the water tank to the lid that doubles as a drip tray, feels thoughtfully designed. I appreciated the reusable filter system, a feature that not only reduces waste but also saves me from constantly buying filters. However, the lightweight (7.8 ounces) build made it feel less robust than I would have liked. While it hasn‚Äôt tipped over during use, I found myself handling it more cautiously than other coffee makers in my collection.

**Ease of Use**  
The OXO Brew‚Äôs manual operation mode is straightforward. I have to admit, I was skeptical about the ""auto-drip tank"" at first. But it genuinely delivers on its promise of controlling water flow for an even brew. Simply add coffee grounds and pour boiling water into the water tank, which has markings for up to 12 ounces. The tank essentially takes over, distributing water evenly thanks to its precise hole pattern. This setup removes the guesswork often associated with traditional pour-over methods. I used it once during a particularly groggy morning, and even then, it was idiot-proof! However, one downside was the lid. While it indeed retained heat during brewing, I found the double-use as a drip tray slightly gimmicky‚Äîit didn‚Äôt hold much liquid, and I often had to rinse it between cups.

**Flavor Quality**  
The proof, as they say, is in the coffee‚Äîand this little device made an impressive cup. Every cup I brewed with it was consistent, flavorful, and had the well-rounded notes I expect from a balanced brew. The included OXO Unbleached All-Natural #2 Cone Coffee Filters might have contributed to the excellent aroma and taste. But since I ran out of them mid-testing, I experimented with other filters, and the results were just as good. I even tried this with multiple coffee beans‚Äîfrom dark roasts to lighter, floral blends‚Äîand each time the coffee maker brought out their full profile. That said, if you prefer a very bold or robust coffee, this might not give you the same punch as a French press or espresso machine.

**Benefits**  
- Simple to use, even for beginners.  
- Well-balanced coffee with consistent flavors.  
- Compact size, perfect for small kitchens and travel.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Lightweight build feels slightly less durable.  
- Lid‚Äôs drip tray function could be more practical.  
- Requires careful handling to avoid spills when assembling.  

**Accessories and Components**  
The box includes the coffee maker itself and 10 OXO Unbleached All-Natural #2 Cone Coffee Filters. This was a thoughtful addition, as I didn‚Äôt have to go out and purchase filters immediately. While there‚Äôs not much else in terms of accessories, it works well as it is. Sadly, it doesn‚Äôt come with a travel-friendly bag or more detailed instructions for amateur coffee enthusiasts who might venture into pour-over for the first time.

**Product Alternatives**  
Pour-over coffee makers abound in the market, and I couldn‚Äôt resist comparing this to others I‚Äôve tried. The Hario V60 is the gold standard in traditional pour-over brewing and offers unparalleled user control. However, the learning curve with the Hario is much steeper compared to the simplified mechanism of the OXO Brew. The Chemex, which is equally renowned, is better suited for brewing multiple cups and offers a similar clean taste. On the downside, Chemex products take up more counter space and are pricier. The main strength of the OXO option is its convenience‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt require a high level of skill while still producing a quality brew. That puts it in a unique niche for casual coffee drinkers or those new to manual brewing.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the features, practicality, and flavor output, the OXO Brew Single Serve Pour-Over Coffee Maker lands at a solid mid-point in terms of value. It doesn‚Äôt have the advanced features of some high-end alternatives, but its performance aligns well with its price point. For what you‚Äôre spending, you‚Äôre getting a coffee maker that‚Äôs ideal for single-serve simplicity, minimal maintenance, and reliable brewing. It hits a sweet spot for anyone who values hassle-free quality. Is it worth it? For its portability and ease of setup, I‚Äôd say absolutely‚Äîespecially for busy mornings or a quick weekend indulgence.
