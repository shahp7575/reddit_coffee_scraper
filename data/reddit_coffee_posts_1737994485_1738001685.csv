1ibfni9,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ibfni9/love_and_loss_my_personal_recount_having_stage_2/,Love and Loss ‚Äî My personal recount having Stage 2 Osteosarcoma (Bone Cancer),"May 6, 2024, I (M22) got match on bumble (F22). We clicked right away. We knew each other's references, she was funny as hell, beautiful, and I could tell that she was smart. But the thing is, when we matched, I didnt message her right away. It took me a message from her and waited 2 hours before replying. Because I had a bad feeling.

You may ask what that bad feeling is? That bad feeling was the feeling that I had cancer. Since January, I had a pain on my right shoulder, throughout the year it got worse. And I had an x-ray, which the doc told me and my mother that there was an anomaly on my bone. But not just the feeling of me having cancer, it was the feeling and fear that I would be a burden to those around me ‚Äî my relationships. My fear that eventually, this girl would leave me once the going gets tough.

Yes, I had a gut feeling that this girl would be the one. I just did. And that fear struck me the night we started messaging each other.

Eventually, she became my girlfriend. We were both in school at this time. I was 3rd year and she was 2nd. Times that we were both not busy, we would see each other. This would go on for like a month. We would go on cute dates, walking and talking until the sun set, sit under our tree at the park, and every single time, we would both take the same jeepney on the way home. I would drop of at the waiting shed in front of starbucks staring at her until I cant see her. Then text her ""I love you, thank you for today"" every single time. This would go on until June.

June was when the semester ended. June was when I felt my life also ended. Because this was when I got diagnosed with bone cancer (osteosarcoma). I was with my mom when the doc laid me the news. She cried, I didnt, but inside, I felt like my heart was being squeezed. I still remember opening the group chat with my best friends in it telling them the news, saying that I would rather be hit with a truck than burden those around me. I laid on the news to my girlfriend, as well. She said that she would stick by my side no matter what. That she would never leave me, even though I was bald and frail and thin.

My life ended that day, but my friends, my family, and most of all, my girlfriend brought me to life. I always told her that she saved me, that I am forever thankful to her for that. 

Chemo started, I still remember having my OJT during that time (I had a week off for chemo). And if you are familiar with the chemo drugs for osteosarcoma, they are brutal, as different cancers have different chemo drugs. I dont even know how I survived that ordeal, as I live a city away from where I go to school and OJT. But I gotta thank my family for that, as my cousin drove me to my OJT and back to my house, and sometimes, I catch a ride with my classmate and his dad.

Me and my girlfriend saw each other barely during that time. Chemo was a bitch. Everything tasted bitter, you feel like you are 80 years old with how weak your body is, the needles, and your nerves feel like theyre gonna pop when the drugs go inside. I was undergoing chemo at a private hospital during that time. That is also when my girlfriend and mom met for the first time. My girlfriend was always there. She would always call, and she would always say the stuff that I wanted to hear.

During my chemo, my girlfriend and my mom would talk outside. They were both ultra yappers, and would get a bit close to each other rather quickly.

In total, I had 8 chemo cycles. In a cycle, there is four days of straight chemo. And there's 19 days of recovery in each cycle, which is not enough, tbh, but what can you do. My first two cycles and my seventh were at a private hospital, but the other five were at a public one, as my family is only middle class. Lower middle if you ask me. At the private hospital, we had the luxury of going home everyday during those four days. Chemo was like 5 hours everyday. But at the public hospital, I was admitted for five days everytime. It was hell. I still remember my first admission there, the woman next to me, her cancer was in her butt. She couldnt move properly. The smell was atrocious.

This went on until December. During this span, my friends started 4th year, I didnt see anybody except my family, nurses, doctors, other patients, sometimes my friends and my girlfriend, but I was fine, all things considering.

My girlfriend would visit from time to time. I am so thankful to her for it. She lives 2 cities away. She is always so busy. She is the president of their club, she is a member of their school theatre, she joins debates in their school AND wins, she's the research leader üíÄ. I was so lucky that she was there for me.

The 8 cycles of chemo finally ended. I was now recovering. I needed to have surgery. I was gonna have surgery in Iloilo (far from where we're from), as that's where the nearest specialist is. We kept in touch. Chat everyday, until I felt that she was distant.

I always tried to keep in touch, yes I had some lapses, but that's just because I was weak, both of my arms had IVs, but I always pestered mom to text her, because I gave my mom my girlfriend's number. But when I got in touch with her, she felt distant. Alam nyo yon? The vibes were off.
Until the day of the operation. She was the last person I chatted before going to the operation room. I left her a long message before I left for operation, saying how much I'm thankful for her, how much I love her.

The operation finally ended. All I could remember was me staring outside the window, then pitch black, and all of a sudden, I was awake. My throat hurting and dry, because of the tube they put in me. Then it hit me. My arm stiff as a board. Every little movement hurt like hell, even though there were painkillers.

When I got to my ward, I told my mom to text her. She was the first thing I thought of (right after halo-halo ofc cos I was hungry af and my throat was really dry LOL). My mom texted her, and I also tried my hardest to move. It was painful, but it was like 8/10 pain, so I used my phone. It was a struggle. I chatted her. I called her, because I promised that I would call. I cried in front of her. But yeah, I felt the vibes were off.

We had THE fight, but the night before, she said she was gonna sleep, because she felt tired. I was trying to have a conversation, but idk, she didnt. She didnt sleep. She played Wild Rift with her friends. These friends, I forgot to mention, were friends of her cousin. They have a house sa bukid. Her cousin would invite his friends and invite my girlfriend. They would drink together. The first time they drunk together, I didnt know that there were other people besides her family. And boys for that matter. She didnt tell me, so that breaks my boundaries. Other times, she wont chat for a while, only to find out she's been playing Roblox with them. January 1, as well, when they had a family outing. And one of her guy friends, let's call him Doy, went with them. My girlfriend got drunk, and si Doy ang lumigpit sa kanya, when there is family with her.

January 3. Is where we had the fight. She said she was gonna buy exchange gifts for her Christmas party with the theatre and have coffee after. I asked who she's with and she said Doy. I asked who Doy is (I wasnt familiar with the nickname she gave me), but got no reply. I checked her Life360 and she's at a high battery, she arrived at her destination, but still no update. She usually updates every single time. I chatted her so many times, because I felt mad that time, because I felt jealous. She came home 9PM. I was so damn worried. She said she was low battery all the time, but Life360 says otherwise. All I did from 3PM-9PM was check Life360. I did all that while my arm was in so much pain. I got so mad. Probably because of overstimulation, as well. I went off on her, saying stuff like some kind of emotional anchor she is, that a simple update she cannot do, that I'm facing the toughest battle of my life and she wasnt there for me, that her presence wasnt felt during this damn battle.

All she said was that how about her? Because there's no one to talk to about my condition, she said, that she cannot provide for me emotionally, because she's not in the best state emotionally herself. She was always busy with the stuff she dabbles with. She said at that time she had family problems, but she would not tell me because she felt that she would be a burden to me.

But I was suffering. I needed her. I said that I got bigger problems than to deal with this stuff. With her being unavailable, with her violating my boundaries. I said all those things because it was the culmination of all that stuff, coupled with intense pain from surgery and overstimulation from the ward.

Then tomorrow came. She didnt talk to me. We chatted one liners to each other everyday for like a week. I was already at home during this time. She didnt even visit me. I asked her when does she plan on fixing things, because I've always wanted to fix things. I've do not like us quarrelling. On our one-liners, I would throw in some I love yous here and there, that I wanted to fix things. But she said to just please give her time. So, I did. She didnt chat, and I also didnt chat.

But lo and behold. Some days later, she chatted that she guesses it's over between us. Na sana nag give man lang ako ng closure before ending things. GIRL I GAVE U SPACE. She said that I ignored her. That she needed me and I just ignored her, that she was depressed and grieved over our relationship during that time. I was depressed and grieving as well. But I respected what she said to give her time. And it turns out that I ignored her??

But as the pathetic guy that I am, I begged. Saying na gagaling na ako, na gagraduate kami ng sabay, that we would do all the things we said we would do. But to no avail. She said she made up her mind during the time I ignored her.

Some days later, she said she needs a break to focus on herself and her growth. That she wants to be selfish for herself. She said she wanted me and can see a future with me, but she said that how I deal with things and that she's unstable, she said it's not going to work. That she has a lot on her plate and that I have better things to worry about, that she will reach out to me when she has the time.

I said that when the time comes, I want to try again, when we're both at better places of our lives. Because I only want her. I said I might sound stubborn, but I love her and can only picture my future with her. But I understand everything. If that's what she wants, then I will give her space.

Days go by, but I message her from time to time, like saying im having a checkup blabla u dont need to respo d just wanted u to know, those kind of important stuff.

But here's the kicker. She unadded me on her dump accounts on IG and Facebook, but im still there on her mains. This night, January 27,  she reposted a story. By guess who? IT'S DOY.

I stalked Doy's IG and I saw his previous story. It was her and her niece. Her niece that I grew attached to over phone. It was a picture of her with the music being Love by Wave to Earth. Well damn. I chatted her, saying it was important. Na prangkahin nya na ako. She said Doy was courting her.

So much for healing. Being the pathetic guy that I am, I still begged? Asking for another chance, na babawi nako sa kanya. But she said all things ended when I ignored her. She said that Doy was there for her. Says a lot about Doy. Ahas. Opportunista. Imagine taking advantage of the time when she's at her lowest, when all she wants is a bit of dopamine. Taking advantage of her vulnerable state. Im so worried. What if he just takes advantage of her and just uses her. Because with morals like that?????

Finally she said that I need to rest. How can I at this point? She said that she's not a good person, that she's not the person that I think she is, that I should find better. And I just said no, that I was content with her, that I was not willing to love anybody else but her. ""Just give me a chance. Just one. Bawi ako. Please, I promise, gagaling na ako. What about our future that we always talked about. That I was gonna take you on a million dates, that we were gonna settle on my hometown because it had no traffic and it was the right pace that you want in life. That even though walang pera, even though we had each other, it's enough"". She said na how much am I planning to drain her? That I am being selfish. But how is that selfish? We planned that together, we named our future kids together. ""Tama na"", she said. ""Pahinga ka na, we'll talk soon. Wag mo pabayaan sarili mo.""

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
- Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
- The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
- Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.\
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.\
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.\
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.\
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.\
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.\
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.\
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.\
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
- Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
- It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
- Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes \
- Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
- Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
- Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
- Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.\
- Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.\
Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.\
- Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.\
Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

Water is Britta filtered but nothing other than that. 

  
This morning brewed Onyx Tropical Weather in the Stagg 121 method and had a great cup. Last week was brewing the same beans in V60 and just can't get the same flavors, just a lot flatter / dull / tasting

I was so excited to implement everything I did over summer to finally better handle my anxiety. It‚Äôs soooo hard and I quickly realised that it wasn‚Äôt as easy so I thought it would be. I‚Äôve gotten sm better with ordering and speaking to strangers (I have the mentality that I‚Äôll most likely never meet them again) so it helps with making it easier. I kinda thought I was getting better. 

I turned up once to my first seminar and never again, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever participated in lectures or even answered a question üò≠ it‚Äôs honestly so embarrassing that I‚Äôm like this. Sometimes I envy people that just don‚Äôt care about what others think. It must be nice lol. I can‚Äôt even eat at a coffee shop without thinking everybody is judging the way I‚Äôm eating or the way I chew or the way I use my cutlery. I end up ordering food and barely touch it. Unless I‚Äôm sat someone where there‚Äôs nobody next to me so I can be comfortable. I hate explaining this to my friends cause they genuinely don‚Äôt understand. 

With the new semester having just started, aswell as the new year, I made it a goal to attend every single mandatory class. I‚Äôm so anxious about my classmates talking about me and how I‚Äôve just disappeared üíÄ I think that makes it even worse. Knowing that I‚Äôll defo be getting looks and whispers. But also I realised that I didn‚Äôt understand any of my exams or essays. And this was purely because I never attended a tutorial. Despite rewatching lectures and looking at past exams, none of it made sense since I didn‚Äôt ever attend. I mostly likely have to retake some modules. 

So I‚Äôm in need of any advice on how to tackle this, it‚Äôs made me so depressed and I feel like my life has been stagnant because I‚Äôm so in my head about every little detail that, in the end, none of it matters. I know uni is expensive and I should care more about doing well than what others think. That‚Äôs the logical view that my friends tell me. But I can‚Äôt seem to think this way.

1ibfhn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teambuilding/comments/1ibfhn2/how_to_build_a_highperforming_team/,How to Build a High-Performing Team,"Building a cohesive and high-performing team is NOT easy. In fact, in today‚Äôs fast-paced and highly digital world, it‚Äôs a complex task that requires a lot of time, patience, and dedication. There are some core principles of great team building that have remained over time that we‚Äôd like to recommend when it comes to strengthening your work community.

1. The best teams don‚Äôt just set goals, they actually share those goals and work together to accomplish them. It‚Äôs easier to offer motivation when everyone is working towards a cohesive goal. This is even better when there‚Äôs an overarching purpose and teams align on WHY their work matters. I‚Äôve noticed this a lot in non-profits, home businesses, or other more personal workspaces. We recommend taking time to define goals and outline what the team is trying to achieve and why it‚Äôs important.
2. For my hiring managers: when hiring, it‚Äôs tempting to look for people who fit the existing culture, but diversity really can‚Äôt be understated. If they have the required skills, it‚Äôs okay to look for candidates that actually bring a new perspective to your workspace. You can always ask yourself: what‚Äôs missing from our dynamic? A more diplomatic person? A more empathetic person? A problem solver? Try and fill the gaps instead of continuously finding people who all share the same qualities.¬†
3. Online tools are great for modern collaboration, but without a human connection/element, that can be more difficult. That can be achieved online, it just takes time! Make time for casual, personal interactions, whether it‚Äôs a quick check-in, a meme channel, or somewhere for people to intentionally get to know a little more about one another. This is not just exclusive to online environments. Giving even in-office workers an opportunity to take a quick break and connect (whether over coffee, a quick game of Uno, etc.) can really work wonders on their morale and ability to collaborate.
4. When conflict arises, focus on healthy conflict. When managed constructively, healthy conflict fosters better solutions and stronger bonds. Establish clear communication ground rules and encourage debates that remain respectful. The willingness to tackle disagreements head-on is a already a good sign of a high-functioning team.
5. Don‚Äôt wait for massive milestones to celebrate! Recognize small victories and accomplishments along the way to keep morale high and momentum steady. That can include simply acknowledging someone‚Äôs extra effort. Consistent appreciation makes a big difference.
6. Don‚Äôt micromanage, as it can stifle creativity. Instead, trust your team members to make decisions within their roles and support them when they take risks. Encouraging this level of independence can improve confidence and drive innovation, and it also implies a level of trust in the team that you‚Äôre on.¬†
7. The well-being of your team is just as important as their productivity. Burnout is real! Ignoring it could cost you projects or entire teams. Encourage boundaries, respect personal time, and provide access to different resources. A well-rested and balanced team is far more effective than one constantly on the brink of crashing out.
8. Finally, feedback is one of the most powerful tools for growth. Create a culture where giving and receiving feedback is normal and can be done in a constructive way. This open dialogue ensures that everyone has the opportunity to learn and improve.

Building a strong team is an ongoing process. Regularly revisit your team‚Äôs dynamics and assess their needs so that you can adapt as necessary. By staying proactive and intentional, you can create a team that not only works well together but excels in any environment.",1,1738000886.0,Teambuilding,0,1.0,False

Howdy I decided to create this list of shows that remind me of Saiki K. While not completely the same each show has some kind of similar aspect. Saiki K is one of my favorite shows in existence, (Idk who i was before December 28 2017) and nothing has quite ever scratched my itch like this show does but these shows have a similar feel.

""The Daily life of an Immortal King."" Wang Ling is basically Saiki just in a different font. Just about everyone in this society has powers however his powers are extraordinary. (He doesn't want them to be). He's literally God Like but just wants to live an average life. I'm ranking this one as close to Saiki K as possible. The main differences are like I said this society does run on magic so everyone has powers but Wang Lings powers are like God Teir and everyone thinks he's a loser. TDLIK also is more modern in its references, like literally on episode 2 we get a how to basic reference. Very LOL. The humor is similar, the animation is very pretty, the characters are all likeable. There is romance but not overwhelmingly so, and this show has a bit more fighting. The show is originally in Mandarin but the English dub is nice imo.

Mob Psycho 100. Of course a classic. Mob Psycho follows Mob another OP psychic as he learns to deal with his emotions (and hopefully doesn't go 100%) It's more of a coming of age story imo but the humor elements are still there. I personally didn't like it as much (irdk why) but If you like Saiki I feel like this could be a 98/2 situation because all my other friends loved Mob Psycho.

Mashle: Magic and Muscles. Regularly slept on by Saiki fans but Mash lives in a society where everyone is a magic user... except him, so he basically just works out and becomes extremely over powered. The humor is there the characters are loveable, and The love for a sweet treat is also there. Coffee Jelly ü§ù Cream Puffs. I love Mashle.

Life Lessons with Uramichi Oniisan. This show follows an ex Olympic level gymnast and his daily life working on a children's TV show. He's cynical, and over all depressed and over it. This show is a comedic slice of life and the humor definitely is a bit more dry than saiki k but I still love it.

Gintama. The OG the humor is fast paced witty and loveable. Not much else to say. I love Gintama. Please watch. Thx ily.

Sakamoto Desu Ga. Sakamoto is somehow the coolest guy ever always getting the ladies. This makes the other guys sick leading to them pulling pranks on him however Sakamoto always wins.

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Haruhi is a very odd and eccentric girl and she proves to be troublesome for Kyon her classmate.

Honorable mentions: Ghost Stories Dub, One Punch, Way of a House Husband.

So feel free to add to my list but these are just some shows I really like that remind me of Saiki and I hope you guys give them a watch! <3

1ibepjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ibepjr/echoes_of_the_damned/,Echoes of the damned,"""You've got to be kidding me,"" Adam grumbled into the phone, his eyes scanning the crowded caf√© for a glimpse of his no-show informant. He took a sip of lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste echoing his mood. It was a typical Friday night in the city, a cacophony of laughter and clinking glasses providing the soundtrack.

Adam's attention snapped to the entrance as a figure emerged from the shadows, a USB stick in hand, and a look that screamed 'I've seen things you wouldn't believe'. The man approached, sliding the stick across the sticky tabletop. ""It's all here,"" he whispered, his eyes darting nervously around the room. ""Just don't follow me."" And with that, he disappeared into the night, leaving Adam with more questions than answers.

The USB stick contained a single file, labeled 'EchoesOfTheDamned'. Curiosity piqued, Adam inserted it into his computer, the screen flickering to life with a disturbing image‚Äîa woman, bound and gagged, with the same terrified expression that had haunted the last three crime scenes. His stomach churned. This wasn't just a random lead; it was a taunt from the killer.

He delved deeper into the file, the images growing more gruesome with every click. Suddenly, the screen froze, and the caf√©'s lights flickered. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end. He knew he wasn't alone. The music screeched to a halt, leaving an eerie silence that was only broken by the echo of his own breath.

Adam's heart raced as he yanked the USB out of his computer, the room plunging into darkness. He fumbled for his phone, the screen casting a faint glow, revealing a message in a font that dripped like blood: ""You're getting closer, but not close enough."" A cold, damp hand clamped over his mouth, and his eyes widened in terror as the room tilted around him. The last thing he heard before the world went black was the sound of his own muffled scream, trapped in the silence of the empty caf√©.

The next morning, Adam woke up in a cold, unfamiliar room, the smell of antiseptic and metal overwhelming. His arms and legs were bound to a chair, a single light bulb swinging overhead, casting stark shadows across the floor. The walls were lined with screens, displaying the twisted art of the darkweb, and in the center, a camera pointed directly at him. The game had just begun.

Panic flooded his veins as he struggled against his restraints. His eyes searched the room for an escape, but all he found were locked doors and windows. His phone was gone, the caf√© a distant memory. He could feel the cold steel of the chair against his skin, and the stickiness of the tape that sealed his mouth.

The sound of footsteps grew louder, and the door creaked open. A figure emerged, dressed in a butcher's apron, a knife glinting in the dim light. Adam's heart hammered against his chest as the figure approached, a sadistic smile playing across their lips. He recognized the eyes from the photos he'd studied‚Äîhis pursuer was now his captor.

The killer leaned in close, their breath hot against his ear. ""Welcome, detective,"" they whispered, their voice a low purr that sent shivers down his spine. ""You've seen my art, now it's time to become part of it."" The words sent a jolt of fear through him, and he realized that he wasn't just a detective anymore‚Äîhe was the latest masterpiece in a twisted gallery of terror.

The killer stepped back, admiring their work. Adam's eyes darted to the screens, now displaying the live feed of the room. His breath grew shallow as the reality set in‚Äîhis fate was about to be broadcast to the depraved audience of the darkweb. The knife glinted again, and the figure began to circle him, their eyes gleaming with a mix of excitement and madness. He knew he had to escape, to somehow warn the world of the monster lurking in the digital shadows.

With every ounce of strength he could muster, Adam wrenched his body to the side, the chair scraping against the floor. The figure paused, surprised by his struggle. It was a brief moment of respite, but it was all he needed. He slammed his chair into the nearest screen, shattering it into a shower of sparks. The feedback screeched through the room, and the lights flickered.

The killer's smile widened, amused by the show. They reached for a lever on the wall, and the room's temperature plummeted. Adam felt his body seizing up, his muscles locking in the cold. He knew what was coming next‚Äîhis torture would be the next viral hit on the darkweb.

But then, something unexpected‚Äîthe lights went out completely, the screens flickered off, and the room was plunged into silence. The killer's laughter turned to a snarl of frustration. Adam felt a sudden rush of adrenaline. This was his chance. He had to get out, to put an end to this nightmare before it was too late.

The sound of the door unlocking echoed through the room. The figure lunged at him, but Adam managed to tip the chair over, his bound body hitting the floor with a thud. The cold concrete bit into his skin, but he ignored the pain, pushing himself across the floor. He had to get out. Behind him, the killer stumbled in the dark, cursing.

Using his elbows and bound feet, Adam propelled himself towards the door, the tape cutting into his skin. The killer's footsteps grew closer, their breathing ragged and angry. The cold metal of the knife brushed against his neck, and he braced for the end. But then, a flash of light‚Äîthe room lit up with the blue and red strobes of police sirens. The killer froze, their eyes wide with panic.

Adam took the opportunity to kick out, the chair toppling over, sending the killer sprawling. He rolled over, the tape tearing from his mouth. ""Help!"" he screamed, his voice hoarse. ""I'm in here!"" The sirens grew louder, the door slammed open, and a SWAT team stormed in, guns drawn.

The killer was swiftly apprehended, their reign of terror at an end. Adam, though shaken, was alive. He watched as the monster was dragged away, the screens in the room now displaying the live feed of their arrest. The audience of the darkweb had switched from viewers to witnesses, their anonymity shattered by the very chaos they had craved.

As the SWAT team cut him free, Adam took a deep, trembling breath. He had survived the nightmare, but the images of the darkweb's grisly art would never leave his mind. He stumbled to his feet, his legs wobbly beneath him, and stumbled towards the exit. The cold air outside was a welcome slap in the face, bringing him back to reality.

The detective in charge, a stern-faced woman with a sharp jawline, approached him. ""You okay?"" she asked, her voice filled with a mix of concern and professional detachment. Adam nodded, trying to compose himself.

""The USB stick,"" he croaked, holding out the evidence. ""It's all there.""

Her eyes narrowed. ""We'll take it from here.""

Days passed, and the case made national headlines. The darkweb was ablaze with chatter about the 'Detective Who Got Away'. Adam couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, that the eyes from the other side of the screen hadn't disappeared with the killer's arrest.

He threw himself into work, trying to find solace in the familiar rhythm of his job. But every click on his computer, every shadow that moved just beyond his peripheral vision, sent a shiver down his spine. The darkweb had left its mark on him.

One evening, as he was about to close his office, a new email popped up in his inbox. 'EchoesOfTheDamned - Part 2'. His heart skipped a beat. Could it be? He opened it with trembling hands, the screen revealing a video with a new, even more disturbing message.

The camera panned over a series of images‚Äîfamiliar faces, all victims of the killer, and then stopped on a photo of his own family, taken from his personal files. The knife from the caf√© gleamed in the center, and the same blood-red text scrolled across the screen: ""The game isn't over, detective.""

Adam's world spun. He knew he had to act fast. He called the detective, her voice a beacon of calm in the storm. ""It's started again,"" he said, his voice low. ""They've got my family.""

The detective's tone grew serious. ""We're on it.""

But Adam couldn't just sit and wait. He had to find them before it was too late. He dove back into the dark, twisted world of the darkweb, using his newfound knowledge as both a weapon and a shield. He knew he was playing a dangerous game, but the stakes were higher than ever‚Äîit was personal now.

He followed the breadcrumbs through a labyrinth of forums and encrypted messages, each step bringing him closer to the monster's lair. His obsession grew, his days blending into nights as he tracked down leads and pieced together the puzzle.

One evening, he stumbled upon a thread that made his blood run cold. It was an auction‚Äîhis family's lives up for grabs to the highest bidder. He had to find them before the timer hit zero. His hands flew across the keyboard, hacking into the website, trying to trace the IP address. But it was a wild goose chase, a digital maze designed to lead him in circles.

Adam knew he was in over his head. The darkweb had become his new enemy, a living, breathing beast that fed on fear and pain. And he was its latest prey.

He turned to his network of underground contacts, people who knew the darkest corners of the internet better than anyone else. They whispered of a shadowy figure known as 'The Puppeteer', the mastermind behind the auction. It was rumored that no one had ever found them, that they were a ghost in the digital world. But Adam wasn't just anyone. He had faced the worst of humanity and lived to tell the tale. He had the determination of a man with everything to lose.

Days turned into weeks, and the trail grew cold. The emails grew more personal, the taunts more sinister. Adam's sleep was plagued with nightmares of his family suffering at the hands of the twisted minds that frequented the darkweb. The weight of his failure bore down on him like a mountain of guilt, crushing his spirit.

But then, a glimmer of hope‚Äîa slip-up, a clue that pointed to a real-world location. A warehouse on the outskirts of the city, long abandoned and forgotten. With a mix of dread and determination, Adam set out to save his family, armed with nothing but his wits and a handgun.

The warehouse loomed before him, a grim sentinel of his impending fate. The air was thick with the scent of decay, the only sound the distant howl of the wind. His footsteps echoed through the cavernous space as he moved cautiously, his eyes adjusting to the gloom. The walls were adorned with the same images that had haunted him on the screens in the caf√©‚Äîhis family's terror immortalized in pixels and pixels of horror.

He heard a muffled cry, and his heart jumped into his throat. He followed the sound, his gun raised. The room grew colder, the air thick with anticipation. And there they were‚Äîhis wife and daughter, bound and gagged, their eyes wide with fear. But something was wrong‚Äîthey looked different, almost... inhuman.

Their skin was pale and waxy, their eyes sunken. His wife's once vibrant hair was matted with something sticky and dark. He rushed towards them, calling out their names. But as he reached out to touch them, their forms began to flicker, like a video glitch. His hand passed through them, and he realized with a sinking feeling that he was too late.

The floor beneath him gave way, and he plummeted into a pit of cold, black water. The current was strong, pulling him deeper into the abyss. Panic set in, and he struggled against the inky embrace, his lungs burning for air.

As he sank, the walls of the pit transformed into screens, the faces of his family morphing into the grotesque images from the darkweb. The water filled his nose, his mouth, his eyes. The world went dark, and he knew he was about to become just another echo in the digital void.

But just as the darkness claimed him, a hand reached out, pulling him back to the surface. Gasping for breath, he was hauled onto the cold concrete, coughing up water. The detective from the raid stood over him, her face a mask of grim determination. ""It's not over,"" she said. ""But we're going to end it.""

The game had just entered a new level, and Adam was ready to play. He had nothing left to lose. Together, they would navigate the treacherous digital landscape, bringing down The Puppeteer and rescuing his family from the clutches of the darkweb's twisted reality.

The battle lines were drawn, and the stakes had never been higher. The real nightmare was just beginning.

Adam and the detective, now an unexpected duo, retreated to a safehouse, the walls adorned with the latest tech and screens that buzzed with life. They studied the footage from the USB stick, the digital breadcrumbs that had led him to this hellish place. The images of his family grew more distorted with each passing minute, a macabre countdown that fueled his rage and her resolve.

The detective spoke in hushed tones, her eyes never leaving the screens. ""We've got to move fast. The auction ends tonight. We can't let anyone else win.""

Adam nodded, his jaw clenched. ""I'll do whatever it takes.""

They worked tirelessly, hacking through layers of encryption, following a digital trail that grew more sinister with each twist. The darkweb was a labyrinth, but Adam was driven by a fury that made him feel invincible. The detective watched him, her expression a mix of admiration and concern. He was a man on the edge, and she knew the cost of crossing it.

The clock ticked down, and the tension grew palpable. They found a way to trace the location of the next 'performance'. It was a dilapidated theater, a perfect stage for the darkweb's twisted play. Adam and the detective, armed to the teeth, approached the theater under the cover of night, the neon sign flickering ominously.

They burst through the doors, guns blazing. The theater was a hive of shadows, the air thick with the stench of decay. The auction was in full swing, the screens displaying a live feed of his family's torture. The bidders, nothing but avatars and usernames, were watching with sick delight. Adam's eyes narrowed, his mind focused on one goal‚Äîto save them.

They fought through the theater, dodging bullets and hacking through the digital barriers that the killer had set up. The detective's expertise in technology was invaluable, and together they made their way backstage. The room was a nightmare come to life‚Äîa tableau of pain and suffering, with his wife and daughter at the center.

Adam roared with rage, charging towards them. The killer, dressed in a grotesque clown mask, turned to face him, a knife glinting in their hand. ""You should have stayed away,"" they hissed, their voice distorted by a voice modulator. ""You're not ready for the final act.""

Adam didn't hesitate. He tackled the killer, the two of them rolling across the floor in a desperate struggle. The knife clattered away, and he pinned the killer down, his fists flying. The detective rushed to cut his family free, her eyes never leaving the screens that flickered with the life of the auction.

As the last bonds fell away, the killer managed to slip from Adam's grasp, disappearing into the shadows. The detective called for backup, her voice sharp and commanding. But Adam didn't need them. He knew where the killer would go‚Äîback to the digital lair where it all began.

The chase continued, through the dark alleys of the city and into the heart of the darkweb. The digital world bled into the real one, the line between them blurring until it was impossible to tell which was which. The auction was in chaos, the screens flashing with the panic of the bidders.

Finally, they reached the source‚Äîa hidden server room, the beating heart of The Puppeteer's operation. The killer was there, typing frantically, trying to escape the digital noose that was closing around them. Adam grabbed them, slamming them against the wall, the detective at his side.

The mask fell away, revealing a face that was all too human. ""Please,"" the killer begged, their voice a whimper. ""It's not me. It's the darkweb‚Äîit made me do it.""

But Adam had seen enough. He pulled the trigger, and the room was filled with the deafening roar of the gunshot. The screens flickered, and the digital world stuttered. The killer slumped to the ground, lifeless. The detective looked at him, her expression unreadable.

""It's over,"" she said, her voice shaking slightly.

Adam stared at the lifeless body before them, the clown mask a sad reminder of the monster that had haunted him for weeks. His family was safe, but the battle had taken its toll. The detective's eyes searched his, looking for some semblance of relief, but all she found was a void of rage and pain.

The sirens grew louder, the cavalry of blue and red lights painting the streets outside the theater. They had won, but the cost had been higher than he could ever have imagined. His family was safe, but the nightmares would linger, a testament to the horrors he had faced.

As the backup team swarmed in, Adam felt a strange sense of detachment. The screens around them flickered and died, the digital world that had consumed his life for so long now silent. The detective took his hand, her grip firm and reassuring. ""We did it,"" she whispered.

But Adam knew it wasn't over. The darkweb was a hydra, and for every head they chopped off, two more would grow in its place. He had glimpsed the depths of its depravity, and it had left a mark on his soul that would never fully heal.

In the aftermath of the operation, Adam found himself unable to return to his old life. The mundane cases no longer held his interest; they were mere shadows of the horrors he had faced. The detective, now a constant presence in his life, understood his obsession. She had seen the darkest corners of humanity too.

Together, they formed a new division, one that focused solely on the digital underbelly of the city. They called themselves 'The Nightshade Unit', hunting down the monsters that lurked in the shadows of the internet. Each case brought them closer to understanding the twisted minds that thrived in the digital abyss, and each victory was a step towards reclaiming their own humanity.

But every time they thought they had made a difference, the darkweb would respond with a new, more disturbing challenge. It was a never-ending game of cat and mouse, with the stakes always rising. And as they grew closer, the line between the real world and the digital nightmare grew thinner.

Adam knew that he was becoming a part of the very world he sought to destroy. The echoes of the damned followed him, whispering of the unspeakable things that lay just beyond the screen. Yet he couldn't look away. He was the detective who had survived, the one who knew the darkest secrets of the digital realm. And as long as the game continued, he would play.",1,1737999008.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1ibepb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1ibepb4/had_a_serious_convo_w_my_husband_last_night/,Had a serious convo w/ my husband last night,"I joined this community at the tail end of last year; I am so grateful for this safe space!  After the election I felt a need to hit the ground running to get prepared for the new administration.  I knew it was going to be bad.  I told my husband I wanted to invest in a deep freezer as we don't one and I wanted to stock up.  He was like, ""I don't think it's going to get that bad, and we have two fridges already.""  But they are not large fridges and the freezer space is limited.  Nevertheless, he kind of took the wind out of my sails.  

One thing I did focus on stocking up on was coffee.  My husband basically mainlines it everyday.  But even that, he was like, why are you buying so much coffee?  I said because there's going to be tariffs, it's going to get very expensive.  He expressed doubt.  Ugh!!

Well, the news about Colombia over the weekend put me over the edge.  I sat down with him last night and explained the emerging tariff war with Colombia, and how that is going to  significantly impact the price of coffee.  He was like, oh wow.  YEAH OH WOW.  I also explained to him that bird flu is decimating flocks; I don't eat poultry, but he does.  Bird flu has me deeply concerned and I want to stock up on PPE.  

I explained to him that going forward, he needs to believe me, and I am taking the lead on prepping our household.  I'm buying a deep freezer and he can't stop me.  I'm going to Costco and stocking up on dry and frozen goods.  I told him this is very serious, and we need to take it seriously.  He listened and apologized; he said he never meant to discourage me, he just didn't think it could get that bad.  I said ok but you made me feel like I was overreacting.  Even if I am being alarmist, this is all stuff we'll use anyway.  I'd rather be overprepared than waking up one day being unable to afford essentials and having no backup supply.

The freezer is being delivered this week and shortly after posting this I will head out to Costco.  My credit card will be working hard today lol. 

Thank you all for being an excellent resource and helpful community.       ",124,1737998994.0,TwoXPreppers,28,0.98,False
1ibeopd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1ibeopd/echoes_of_the_damned/,Echoes of the damned.,"""You've got to be kidding me,"" Adam grumbled into the phone, his eyes scanning the crowded caf√© for a glimpse of his no-show informant. He took a sip of lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste echoing his mood. It was a typical Friday night in the city, a cacophony of laughter and clinking glasses providing the soundtrack.

Adam's attention snapped to the entrance as a figure emerged from the shadows, a USB stick in hand, and a look that screamed 'I've seen things you wouldn't believe'. The man approached, sliding the stick across the sticky tabletop. ""It's all here,"" he whispered, his eyes darting nervously around the room. ""Just don't follow me."" And with that, he disappeared into the night, leaving Adam with more questions than answers.

The USB stick contained a single file, labeled 'EchoesOfTheDamned'. Curiosity piqued, Adam inserted it into his computer, the screen flickering to life with a disturbing image‚Äîa woman, bound and gagged, with the same terrified expression that had haunted the last three crime scenes. His stomach churned. This wasn't just a random lead; it was a taunt from the killer.

He delved deeper into the file, the images growing more gruesome with every click. Suddenly, the screen froze, and the caf√©'s lights flickered. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end. He knew he wasn't alone. The music screeched to a halt, leaving an eerie silence that was only broken by the echo of his own breath.

Adam's heart raced as he yanked the USB out of his computer, the room plunging into darkness. He fumbled for his phone, the screen casting a faint glow, revealing a message in a font that dripped like blood: ""You're getting closer, but not close enough."" A cold, damp hand clamped over his mouth, and his eyes widened in terror as the room tilted around him. The last thing he heard before the world went black was the sound of his own muffled scream, trapped in the silence of the empty caf√©.

The next morning, Adam woke up in a cold, unfamiliar room, the smell of antiseptic and metal overwhelming. His arms and legs were bound to a chair, a single light bulb swinging overhead, casting stark shadows across the floor. The walls were lined with screens, displaying the twisted art of the darkweb, and in the center, a camera pointed directly at him. The game had just begun.

Panic flooded his veins as he struggled against his restraints. His eyes searched the room for an escape, but all he found were locked doors and windows. His phone was gone, the caf√© a distant memory. He could feel the cold steel of the chair against his skin, and the stickiness of the tape that sealed his mouth.

The sound of footsteps grew louder, and the door creaked open. A figure emerged, dressed in a butcher's apron, a knife glinting in the dim light. Adam's heart hammered against his chest as the figure approached, a sadistic smile playing across their lips. He recognized the eyes from the photos he'd studied‚Äîhis pursuer was now his captor.

The killer leaned in close, their breath hot against his ear. ""Welcome, detective,"" they whispered, their voice a low purr that sent shivers down his spine. ""You've seen my art, now it's time to become part of it."" The words sent a jolt of fear through him, and he realized that he wasn't just a detective anymore‚Äîhe was the latest masterpiece in a twisted gallery of terror.

The killer stepped back, admiring their work. Adam's eyes darted to the screens, now displaying the live feed of the room. His breath grew shallow as the reality set in‚Äîhis fate was about to be broadcast to the depraved audience of the darkweb.

The mask fell away, revealing a face that was all too human. ""Please,"" the killer begged, their voice a whimper. ""It's not me. It's the darkweb‚Äîit made me do it.""

But Adam had seen enough. He pulled the trigger, and the room was filled with the deafening roar of the gunshot. The screens flickered, and the digital world stuttered. The killer slumped to the ground, lifeless. The detective looked at him, her expression unreadable.

""It's over,"" she said, her voice shaking slightly.

Adam stared at the lifeless body before them, the clown mask a sad reminder of the monster that had haunted him for weeks. His family was safe, but the battle had taken its toll. The detective's eyes searched his, looking for some semblance of relief, but all she found was a void of rage and pain.

The sirens grew louder, the cavalry of blue and red lights painting the streets outside the theater. They had won, but the cost had been higher than he could ever have imagined. His family was safe, but the nightmares would linger, a testament to the horrors he had faced.

As the backup team swarmed in, Adam felt a strange sense of detachment. The screens around them flickered and died, the digital world that had consumed his life for so long now silent. The detective took his hand, her grip firm and reassuring. ""We did it,"" she whispered.

But Adam knew it wasn't over. The darkweb was a hydra, and for every head they chopped off, two more would grow in its place. He had glimpsed the depths of its depravity, and it had left a mark on his soul that would never fully heal.

In the aftermath of the operation, Adam found himself unable to return to his old life. The mundane cases no longer held his interest; they were mere shadows of the horrors he had faced. The detective, now a constant presence in his life, understood his obsession. She had seen the darkest corners of humanity too.

Together, they formed a new division, one that focused solely on the digital underbelly of the city. They called themselves 'The Nightshade Unit', hunting down the monsters that lurked in the shadows of the internet. Each case brought them closer to understanding the twisted minds that thrived in the digital abyss, and each victory was a step towards reclaiming their own humanity.

But every time they thought they had made a difference, the darkweb would respond with a new, more disturbing challenge. It was a never-ending game of cat and mouse, with the stakes always rising. And as they grew closer, the line between the real world and the digital nightmare grew thinner.

Adam knew that he was becoming a part of the very world he sought to destroy. The echoes of the damned followed him, whispering of the unspeakable things that lay just beyond the screen. Yet he couldn't look away. He was the detective who had survived, the one who knew the darkest secrets of the digital realm. And as long as the game continued, he would play.",1,1737998953.0,Horror_stories,0,1.0,False

Hey, AIxpert fam! Ever find yourself drowning in menial, repetitive tasks? Who wants to do the same thing over and over when you could be doing something that sparks joy (or at least isn't mundane)? Well, you're in luck! Today we're diving into the world of Zapier and how AI integrations can make your life a whole lot easier. It's like setting up your own personal assistant who never skips a beat! üéâ

---

### Why Zapier? 

Zapier is a powerful automation tool that connects your apps and automates workflows. Imagine the hours you save from not having to manually transfer data or send reminders. It's the ultimate time-saver and game-changer in productivity. Want to seamlessly connect Gmail with Google Sheets or have Slack alerts for important emails? Zapier's your buddy! 

### Getting Started with Zapier

1. **Create a Zap:** This is essentially an automated workflow, a trigger-action system. For example, when you receive an email (trigger), it updates a spreadsheet (action).

2. **Choose your Apps:** With over 3000 apps available, the possibilities are almost endless. Popular choices? Google Drive, Trello, Slack, and Salesforce to name a few.

3. **Set Conditions:** Specify triggers based on certain conditions. Do you want an alert only for emails labeled ""urgent""? No problem, Zapier‚Äôs got your back.

### AI Integrations: The Secret Sauce ü•´‚ú® 

Let‚Äôs kick it up a notch with AI. Zapier can integrate with AI-powered tools like OpenAI's GPT-3, making your workflows smarter and more efficient.

- **Automate Responses:** Use AI to draft email responses or generate reports. Imagine responding to inquiries in seconds with AI-crafted messages that hit just the right tone!

- **Data Analysis:** Hook up your sheets to an AI tool that can analyze data or even predict trends. You'll be the forecasting wizard on your team! üìà

### Real-life Example: My Personal Experience

I was drowning in daily email overload until I set up a Zap that auto-organized my messages based on urgency, powered by some nifty AI text classification. This simple switch freed up hours of my day, giving me time to sip coffee and dive into more creative projects. ‚òï

### DIY Tips for Zapier and AI

- **Start Small:** Don‚Äôt overwhelm yourself. Begin with simple Zaps and gradually increase complexity.
  
- **Test and Iterate:** Not every setup will work perfectly. Be ready to tweak and refine your Zaps as needed.

- **Explore AI Libraries:** Check out libraries like Hugging Face or OpenAI to find tools that fit your workflow needs.

1ibeia4,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ibeia4/short_stay_in_istanbul_poc_womanvegan_experience/,Short stay in Istanbul (POC woman+vegan experience),"I recently visited Istanbul for 3.5 days with my boyfriend, and had a pretty good time! Thought I'd share my experience and some vegan food recs.

Disclaimer: I'm a lighter-skinned south asian woman and I did go with my white Irish bf, so your mileage may vary. 

Passport control: the officers were very relaxed; I had all my documents, bookings, etc. ready but she just looked at my passport, evisa, and residence permit and let me through no questions asked. 

Accommodation: We stayed at The Wings Hotel Karak√∂y, on the European side near Galata Tower. Honestly no complaints regarding the service, they were helpful and friendly, and booked us a taxi back to the airport. We chose this hotel because we wanted to support a smaller business, and because it has a lovely view of the Bosphorus from their rooftop terrace cafe. The price for the room was reasonable (but tbh we're so traumatized by the obscene hotel prices in Ireland so pretty much anywhere else seems more reasonable!) Location was perfect too, just a minute away from a tram stop and a few bus stops, plus walking distance to Cihangir and Istiklal. It took around 15 minutes to get to Sultanahmet with the tram. There's also a ferry port literally 30 seconds away. Food at the hotel cafe was relatively expensive so we only ate breakfast there once to see the view. 

Transport: Public transport was really easy to use, and Google maps was good enough for all our needs. Trams and ferries seemed to arrive on time so we were never waiting too long. We recommend getting an Istanbulkart. The ferries were so cool, id never used one as public transport before so that was an interesting experience, and the views are so beautiful. Kinda jealous of people who use them to commute üëÄ The only reason we used a taxi to get to and from the airport was that we were a bit far from any of the metro stations and the airport bus, so we didn't want the hassle of doing multiple transfers during rush hour with a suitcase. Luckily both our taxi experiences were fine, and in fact on the way in the driver actually called the hotel (as he didn't speak much English) to have them explain to us that he couldn't drop us off right at the hotel (it was in car-free zone), so we would be dropped off a minute away. We felt totally comfortable on all the public transport. It got packed sometimes ofc but that's to be expected.

Activities: The first evening we just walked around Karak√∂y/Beyoglu and the pier, taking in the views. The next day we did Sultanahmet: Hagia Sofia + museum, Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern. Yes the sites (other than the blue mosque) are a bit pricey, which is why we decided to skip Topkapi Palace this time around. Also sucked that we couldn't enter the ground floor of the Hagia Sofia but it is what it is. On the way back we stopped off at Eminonu and decided to get on a ‚Ç¨4 Bosphorus cruise at the pier there, which ended up being the best value activity of the whole trip‚Äîwe had no idea how long it would be and how far it would go (and for ‚Ç¨4 we expected it to be at most 30mins long). The cruise ended up lasting 90 minutes and just kept going down the strait, slightly past Sultan Mehmet bridge, before heading back. Such an amazing view and we're glad we got so much time to savor it. 

The next day we spent the morning and some of the afternoon in Cihangir and Istiklal, before going back to Sultanahmet to go to the Hagia Sofia museum. We walked through the Egyptian market, then wandered around Beyoglu for the evening. 

The final full day we took a ferry to Kadik√∂y and wandered around there for a couple of hours (I was tasked by a friend to procure pickled chillies at a specific store there as well). After lunch we decided to take a ferry to Besiktas, where we walked around some more. We saw Dolmabahce Palace from the outside, but again, since we'd blown through our 'tourist site' budget the first day, we decided to save this for next time. Then we walked most of the way back to the hotel, and after a brief rest, went to Galata Tower, and had dinner near there. 

Vegan food: it's pretty easy to find vegan dishes and snacks if you know what you're looking for. All three of the main street food options in the city center (simit, corn on the cob, roasted chestnuts) are vegan, as is gozleme with potatoes/spinach (you may have to specify no cheese depending on the vendor). In Beyoglu there were so many restaurants with at least a couple of vegan options that it was hard to choose. 

Generally food and groceries were affordable (but this is coming from someone who earns in euros), however there were a couple of specific vegan/notable restaurants I wanted to try out that I knew were more on the bougie side, and so those were on par with Dublin prices. Here's a list of places I ate at and my verdict:

-Vegan Dukkan Lokanta (Cihangir)
On the pricier side, but one of the places that always came up in my searches for vegan restaurants. Also one of the few places where I knew I could try vegan manti. The manti was delicious and I'm glad I climbed the hills of Cihangir to get a taste of it. They also have a vegan store next door.

-Ciya Sofrasi (Kadik√∂y)
I think I saw this recommended on this sub even. Food was very good but definitely overpriced. Several vegan options. 

-Tahin (Beyoglu) 
A fast casual chain serving Lebanese food, they had tons of vegan options, pretty ok price, and food was of good quality.

-Karakoy Corba Evi (Beyoglu)
Literally a soup-only restaurant with several vegan options sprinkled in. I got a broccoli soup which was oily, but that I enjoyed nevertheless (I hadn't had broccoli soup in ages). 

-Gumruk (Karak√∂y)
Kind of overpriced but I can't say much about the quality of the food since I only ordered a basic salad (wasn't very hungry). Very bougie/jazz night vibes. 

-Galata Kitchen (Galata)
Reasonable prices and a lot of vegan options, good quality food too. I had manti here again since I liked it so much! 

-Street food stalls (Karak√∂y, Sultanahmet)
This is pretty standard and very cheap fare. I really enjoyed the gozleme in particular, but also has a couple simit and corn-on-the-cobs when I got peckish. 

-Drinks: Boy did we have our fair share of Turkish coffee. Turns out I like it more than espresso. This is available pretty much everywhere. Turkish tea is also great, and I would recommend having tea/coffee at one of those roadside places you will come across‚Äîthere was one right by our hotel so we sat there one evening and just people-watched. 

Vibes: We enjoyed the vibes in Istanbul; despite the crowds things felt very chilled out. We were left alone for the most part and (unlike what we'd read sometimes) were not approached or harassed by anyone in the tourist areas at all. I didn't feel very out of place and felt very safe walking around the city- I don't feel like I was treated any differently to other tourists/locals, and my bf also got the same feeling. Language-wise we tried to brush up on some common words and phrases, and sometimes used Google translate to ask people questions. We didn't interact verbally with locals very much and mostly kept to ourselves.

I'm sure our experience was partly due to only experiencing a very specific part of the city and clearly being tourists, but I appreciated the sense of safety (which is lacking in many parts of Dublin city center üòÖ) we did notice a huge police presence which probably contributed to this, but at the same time we are conscious of the political climate/censorship etc. going on and that locals may be against this.

We loved the 'night culture' in particular‚Äîcafes/coffee stalls and street food stalls being open into the night, people just hanging out, the abundance of public spaces and their use by the general population after work, etc. It's so nice to be able to chill out at a cafe or along the street drinking tea after work, rather than having to go to a pub or restaurant because nothing else is open after 4 ü´† 

Overall we'd love to visit Istanbul again to see other historic parts of the city, and we also want to explore Anatolian Turkey a bit more (specifically Gobekli Tepe).

[WIKI] Electronic Torture: Power Line Communication

https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/17wtg13/wiki_electronic_torture_power_line_communication/

To ascertain whether the pulsing is by PLC, or the hum or pulsing by radiofrequency, submit sound meter reports. See the Meter Apps: Sound wikis and the Meter Reports: Sound wikis.

Differentiate between the hum and PLC. The hum is produced by ionospheric heaters such as HAARP.
The hum is throughout the home and yard. Evidenced by taking measurements in rooms you are not in and the yard that you are not in. Yet, the hum is louder and more vibrational when the electric water heater is on. See the hum wikis.

PLC produces inaudible sound pulsing that is pin point. PLC attacks left ear drum, BROCA'S area of the left side of the brain and the corner of the left eye. PLC can attack other parts of the body.

Ear muffs with EVA foam slightly mitigate pulsing PLC. Criva basalt and water head crate mitigate PLC pulsing from sides, top and rear but not from below. Read those posts.

Before going to sleep, throughout your home, not just in your bedroom:

(1) Unplug USB wall chargers, refrigerator, washer, floor lamps, table lamps, space heaters, blenders, crock pots, coffee makers, etc. Connect washer to an extension cord to make it easier to unplug and plug back in. Remove night lights permanently.

(2) Turn off ceiling light switches. Unplug garage door openers. Even when circuit breakers are off, a light switch that is on in one room can pulse sound to another room.

Turn off the main breaker on the electric pole. It will turn off the service drop line and electric panel. If you don't have a main breaker, install it.

Turn off all circuit breakers in electric panel. Food stays cold in refrigerator over night. Food remains frozen for over a day. 120 volt circuit breakers pulse more than 220 volt circuit breakers.

Turn off the main breaker in electric panel.

If you cannot do the above, test by camping off grid at least a mile from power lines. Do you have vibrations off grid?

People living in multi story dwellings will not be able to mitigate. Neighbors' house wiring below and above them could vibrate. TIs will need to relocate to a single story home preferably off grid.

After awakening, turn on the two main breakers. Turn on just the circuit breakers you are using. Turn them off after using them. Plug whatever you are using. Unplug after use. Reduce electricity use. 

Turn on circuit breaker to water heater every other day to take a shower, wash laundry and wash dishes in hot water. Turn off immediately afterwards. Or install a gas water heater without an electric ignition.

Outlets plus. Power density of pulsing of ceiling light fixtures is less than floor lamps and table lamps plugged into outlets. Keep them unplugged. Use ceiling light fixtures and incandescent light bulbs instead.  Yet, military pulses ceiling light fixtures. Therefore, install sky lights. Or reside in a greenhouse or sun room with no house wiring. Or use candles and LED warm lanterns. Cease using exterior porch light. Instead install solar motion sensors.

Hello!
This isn‚Äôt my main account, but it‚Äôs the one I use for socializing (or at least trying to).
My main account is crowvomit. 
This account is gonna be kinda bland so I‚Äôll just explain my deal here. 

I‚Äôm non-binary (afab), lesbian, and I aim to have an androgynous body. Demisexual. Don‚Äôt message me with horny shit, I do not like that. I am not poly. 
Not looking for a relationship, focusing on other things in life.
Born in ‚Äò04. Wallflower, socially awkward but around friends I‚Äôm pretty outgoing. Super small, regular weight, babyfaced. I look ‚Äúscary‚Äù (exact quote) but I‚Äôm very soft and polite lol. 
I‚Äôve been described as having cat energy but I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm just a flightless bat that screams at things and bumps into windows. My brother says I‚Äôm more like a weasel. 
So don‚Äôt expect ‚Äúgolden retriever gf‚Äù vibes xD

Here‚Äôs some info on things I like:

HOBBIES:
drawing, making stuff like jewelry and costume accessories, foraging, looking for animals, fishing (badly) and hopefully soon I‚Äôll be able to rollerskate. I‚Äôm like dollar store Ramona Flowers.
I love farm life and homesteading. That‚Äôs my ultimate goal, to have a homestead somewhere in the woods and not be surrounded by people.

MUSIC: 
Early Punk/Grunge/Alt metal/folk metal/everything. 
Bands I love: X-Ray Spex, Nirvana, The Ramones, 311, MF DOOM, Weezer, Korpiklaani, Finntroll, Caravan Palace. Smashing Pumpkins.
Anything rock from the 90s is probably on my list. 

SPECIAL INTERESTS: oh boy. 
I love vulture culture and bone collecting. Oddities and taxidermy too! I love bugs and spiders, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds and animals in general. I want to be a zoologist and wildlife Rehabber.
My other interests are collecting Breyer horses, music, and jojos Bizarre Adventure (specifically part 5. everything else after is meaningless to me. My heart is in Italy.)

OTHER SHIT:
My favorite show is Bojack Horseman, but I also love Moral Orel. As far as movies go, I love Scott Pilgrim (still working through the comics) as well as movies from the 70s, cult classics like Harold & Maude. Love emotional shit, like Jojo Rabbit or Fried Green Tomatoes.
I‚Äôm a fan of animation too; prince of Egypt, the lion king, spirit.
I don‚Äôt read much anymore but my favorite books are 1984, Blood Meridian, Call of The Wild, Tale Of Despereaux and The Book Thief.

FANDOMS:
I‚Äôm a furry. I have a lot of generic edgy OCs and I really like fursuits. other than that, I don‚Äôt interact with the fandom. surprisingly I‚Äôm not a gamer. I like film reviews, psychological stuff, learning about scientific and philosophical things.

PETS:
This is the most important into obviously. 
I have a kingdom of Crayfish, two wonderful cats, a dawg, and whatever random animal I decide to take home. I rescued a chicken once. Expect nothing but chaos from me lol. 
Not a plant parent but I want to be. I don‚Äôt know how to keep them alive :( I love moss, though!

FOODS:
Useless information again but eh. I like fruits, vegetables, pasta, shellfish, sushi/sashimi and matcha flavored things. Big on tea, not so much coffee. No allergies so feel free to throw food at me in exchange for compliance.

NO:
I don‚Äôt smoke. I don‚Äôt get high besides taking edibles for extreme social anxiety and when I can‚Äôt calm down. I take normal meds and I firmly believe in science so please don‚Äôt rub crystals on me or I may eat them (jk).
I don‚Äôt party. At all. Do not bring me to the clurb, either. I don‚Äôt drink but occasionally I have limoncello after dinner.
I do not like discussing politics or religion, but I do have my own set of beliefs.
No, I‚Äôm not the emo kid from Horton Hears a Who; he is a coward, and I am not a coward.
(I hope someone gets that reference).

We're working with these intricate data systems and I've only been taught about a small part of them, but I'm constantly checking to see if there are new things for me to pick up. Well, apparently I'm going too fast. The coworker who's teaching me thinks I'm not listening to him and went to talk to our boss. It's just that when I ask him for help, he starts telling me where to click and what to type in, while I first want to explain what I've already been doing and what problems I ran into. He sees my explanations as me making excuses and like I know better.

My boss told me that I should slow down, bc I need to understand what I'm doing, but I DO! It's just when coworker guy starts looking over my shoulder I get nervous and I forget how a computer works or sth. 
He also said that our older colleague also needs stuff to do, so I need to leave some work for her.
Wtf? Why am I being made to feel like I'm incompetent, while everyone else is too slow?! I just want to help, but it really feels like it's not appreciated.

What do people in offices usually do? Just drink coffee all day? Bc I can do that, but I didn't think I was being paid for that.

I let my friend and her child stay at my apartment for a week. Her daughter got sick on Tuesday, and by Wednesday, my friend was very sick with what we now know was confirmed norovirus. She didn‚Äôt tell me she was sick until Sunday, when I returned her missed call while driving home. She was surprised I wasn‚Äôt home yet, as she assumed I‚Äôd returned Saturday.

If I had come home Saturday, as she thought, I would‚Äôve unknowingly walked into a contaminated space and likely gotten sick. Instead, I got home late Sunday and found my apartment in this state:

 - The bathroom hadn‚Äôt been cleaned at all, including vomit on the toilet.

 - Bedding was left unwashed and piled up.

 - My living room was rearranged, with furniture pushed aside, pillows piled on my coffee table, half-eaten pizza buns, and nothing wiped down. Finger prints everywhere, so very clearly not wiped down

 - My dining table was covered with items from around my house shed moved so her kid didnt grab them, including dead plants she didn‚Äôt water.

 - The fridge was rearranged, with open drinks and unfamiliar food, so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs contaminated.

 - A second garbage bin was made in my recycling and left half-full.

She also unplugged and pulled out my bedroom TV from the wall, which now glitches.

What makes this worse is that I spoke to her several times during the week. On Wednesday, she asked how to reload my laundry card, and when I asked if everything was okay (because I had left $25 on it), she said everything was fine. On Thursday, when she left early, we spoke on the phone, and I even asked why she was leaving ahead of schedule. She just said she wanted to go home‚Äîno mention of being sick. During that call, she asked if I wanted her to hire a cleaner. I said no need as long as the place was left the same as she found it.

Had she been honest about the situation, I would‚Äôve hired a cleaner immediately‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt about the money but about protecting myself. I‚Äôm immunocompromised, and norovirus could seriously impact my health. Instead, I had to spend Sunday night cleaning what I could in order to stay the night-- my bedroom, bathroom, and desk area. I‚Äôm still stressed about disinfecting the rest of my home.

I understand she was very sick, but lying about it and leaving my home in this state feels incredibly disrespectful, especially knowing my health risks.

Life is really good to me. I've got friends and people who genuinely love me. It seems so easy to love. I sometimes wonder why it once felt like the most difficult thing on earth for me.

You‚Äôre the voice in the back of my mind, criticizing my every move, my thoughts. The discouragement really took a bigger toll on me than I thought.

also when I was leaving (notice that my brain still think about these small meaningless interaction) I was holding my wallet on my left hand and an old lady with her friend I guess bumped into me, to be fair we both didn't look i was looking the other way, my wallet fell on the ground, she gasped and stood there, I didn‚Äôt make eye contact, I looked down expecting her to pick it and apologize at least but no, that old s**t just stood there shocked, and I picked it, I so felt humiliated, I looked upset, and kept thinking, why didn't told her to pick it up? say sorry? is because I look like a loser?

I've been looking for information on the internet for a long time but without success and pulled dozens of bad shots, so I'm taking the liberty of asking my questions here. Here's my problem: I bought a Rancilio Silvia and a Fellow Opus grinder and every espresso I make is incredibly acidic and quite thin bodied.

I feel like I've tried everything, a grind that's too fine or too wide (and everything in the middle), I've adjusted the OPV valve, tried blooming, bottled water (Volvic brand). The Rancilio Vilvia was bought second-hand, but it has been regularly cleaned and I did a thorough cleaning after purchase. I tried different ratios from 1:1 all the way up to 1:3 and 16g to 18g in the basket. My brew times were between 15 and 1m44s. I'd also like to point out that I use a WDT to distribute the grind and I tried different tamping forces. Nothing works, the coffee is still acidic.

The coffee is good, freshly roasted, it comes from a good roaster (Plaine Cafe, which won the Best Roaster Award in France in 2016) and I tasted it when I bought it. It is a medium roasted 50/50 blend of Arabica and Robusta coffee.

Sometimes it's better to take a break then spend 50 of your fast prompts trying to fix a problem that derive from a bad prompt you wrote at the start of a composer session.

I have revamped my QL a bit and am looking for feedback on anything and everything! My previous version is below.

My name is ----------------- and I am seeking representation for my 60,000 word Satirical Thriller ‚ÄúWhen You Least Expect It‚Äù. This story places the icy female lead style character of ‚ÄúThe Awkward Truth‚Äù by Lee Winter and weaves her into a thriller like ‚ÄúCedarwood Cabin‚Äù by Jade Wilkes that fans of both will enjoy.¬†

Life in an industry dominated by men can be difficult, it can be even more difficult when you must refrain from murdering your co-workers. For Elizabeth Jordan, a cut-throat stockbroker by trade with a secret, murderous past, quelling those urges can occasionally prove difficult. When she is informed of her distant uncle's passing, she learns she is due to receive an inheritance. However, she must first return to her long forsaken hometown of Whispering Pines to claim it. Upon arriving, she finds she has been left a vacant and disrepaired country home. It is during repairs where Elizabeth meets handyman Cole Eastman, who harbors his own dark and turbulent past.

With each unaware of the other's unsavory history, an attraction begins to bloom as they spend time together at the house. These new, budding flames of romance are threatened when Elizabeth decides to return to Minneapolis. Cole, however, has other plans for their burgeoning relationship. Plans that include drugging and locking her in the basement. After learning their meeting was more by his design than fate, Elizabeth discovers she played right into Cole's hands.¬†

Now a captive in her own house, Elizabeth sees her murderous wits pinned against Cole‚Äôs foolproof plan to keep her locked up. If she can placate Cole‚Äôs ego enough to be given free roam of the house, she may find the chance to unleash her violent ways for retribution, rather than escape, for her imprisonment.¬†

\-----

Elizabeth Jordan entered her office's break room like a dormant thundercloud passing over a small town. Conversations paused as heads turned to watch her enter; she enjoyed the reverence. Elizabeth was intimidating not only in reputation, but appearance as well. Slender and taller than most people at the office, Elizabeth was an imposing figure. Long, dark hair kept pristinely straight, weather allowing, availed her an intense presence. High cheekbones and a narrow nose pointed to her lips which held back razor wit. She lamented to find a few white collars buzzing by the coffee maker. The ones who were convinced, upon her hiring, that a woman on their team would be another sandbag to carry across the line. Something Elizabeth had not forgotten in the years since being hired. She took great pleasure in making the perpetrators of that idea pay at every opportunity.¬†

As she approached, one of them turned to face her. He leaned back against the counter on his flat ass with a mug in his hand. The greasy, combed back hair and hyena-like smile adorning a scrawny frame belonged to Paul Frill. The second best earner in the firm behind Elizabeth and the number one pain in the ass.

‚ÄúHey, EJ!‚Äù Paul‚Äôs voice was that of a used car salesman who had gargled oil. Elizabeth wondered what it would sound like while he was being held under water.¬†

‚ÄúPaul, how many times have I told you? ‚ÄòMs. Jordan‚Äô or ‚ÄòElizabeth‚Äô if you absolutely have to speak to me.‚Äù Her condescending tone was purposeful and apparent. Arriving next to him at the counter made her physically uncomfortable. Being next to him was like being close to a bug that might fly at you without warning, a bug she was eager to grind into the floor tiles

It was beautiful, Chris is a sweetheart, literally the purest soul and the vibe of stadium and a few people around me who were actual fans and at least knew the songs if not the entire lyrics. 
But the crowd was horrible, it really shows how cruel the people are when there‚Äôs no watch. We were literally by the stage in 2nd line so had an amazing view. We came across 3 disturbing incidents which made me lose hope in pur generation and humanity. 
1. By 3:30 i told my gf to use the washroom so it wont bother her later as she went in first to hold the place for me. Even a few people around us helped in holding the spot as we all had a good bonding while waiting. Mind you no one had even started standing yet, they were all just sitting, when she came back with a pizza and coffee, of course people are going to not believe that her bf is standing in front, i understand many fake it so, but it is not a reason to abuse someone.
A guy literally said ‚ÄúAgar tu aage gayi toh teri m*a ch**d dunga‚Äù. Seriously this is what humans are? Everyone is there to enjoy, you there for reels doesn‚Äôt give you the right to abuse another person.
2. Then a girl just snatched her coffee and said i am not giving it back, its mine now, the crowd was so jam packed that my girl couldn‚Äôt even argue as she wanted to reach to me was priority. Just proves even girls are not holding their simplicity these days.
3. We had made a beautiful poster with stars and paints everything, while Chris was reading, i purposely did not hold it up when he was reading the opposite side‚Äôs posters, only when he looked at our side i held it up so i dont block others view, still someone just pull the poster and tore it. Someone worked on it hard all night, yes you had no idea about the work behind it but not viewing the artist for 10secs in a 2 hour concert is such a big deal for you guys??

This post was done in collaboration of research with u/best-chest1588 , u/lady_moscato and , u/new-negotiation 7234

Also, this is a lot of reading. Fair warning.

I will say this lead in particular has led us down quite the rabbit hole, some of which we are still trying to iron out, but will follow up. This information in particular highlights how important it is to look into everything (images, sounds, lyrics and even steg) , and that one of the main roots of this whole issue is the use of AI. 

It's important to think of Drake as the mask that needs to be taken off. Once that is done we can begin to expose the vast and frankly concerning systems that control the strings... Let's begin

Before the weekend began in the midst of researching a weird rabbit hole involving Drakes Matchabar investment in 2017, Luisa Durans Mercury Espresso, and some weird involvements with Ashton Kutcher's Thorn. I stumbled on what I now believe to be positive SEO. I googled Kendrick Lamar and Coffee and on the second page of results this article came up.

https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/00000191-9af8-d205-a5f7-bbfcc75b0000-123

Honestly the article weirdly seemed like Kendrick and SZA's Harper's Bazzar article but I couldn't figure out why until I got to the last paragraph

""I know you‚Äôve only been living here for a year, but do you have a favorite coffee shop in L.A. yet?

Yeah, it‚Äôs actually File Systems of Coffee in Hollywood. They‚Äôve got a great JBS [Japanese brown sugar] and a wonderful matcha, which I‚Äôve never tried ‚Äôcause I‚Äôm scared. I think matcha might have too much caffeine in it and I might get addicted, but they have this great JBS. It‚Äôs the closest thing I can find in L.A. to a cortadito [a type of traditional Cuban espresso drink served in McCraney‚Äôs hometown of Miami].""

The first thing that jumped out to me was the mention of Miami and the Cuban espresso drink because we had just been looking into Ryan Weddings drug ring and miami connections to Drake and DJ Khaled on u/conceptuallyinept post which has a lot in the comments. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkKenny/s/kariRkd7jf

The second thing that jumped out to me was the mention of Japanes Brown sugar which is an espresso drink, which brought back the lyrics from reincarnated ""Fuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar"". Brown sugar has also been known to be associated with the drug heroin. 

Then McCraney goes on to say that they have a great Matcha, though he had not tried it because he thought it might have too much caffeine and he might get addicted. 

Matcha jumped out to me due to Drakes investment in matchabar in 2017 which I have to admit is just random but I didn't think too much of it.

But also, matcha has nowhere near the amount of caffeine as coffee let alone the espresso drinks McCraney admitted he loved and is not something you would likely become addicted to, and in fact, is recommended as a hangover cure due to its health benefits.

So then I finally got to the name of the coffee shop, File Systems of Coffee.. and my brain was like going crazy at this point because what an odd name, in what seemed like a random last question in an interview. So I went to the website and I HIGHLY encourage you to do the same.  There really is so much here but I will highlight a few that jumped out

https://filesystemsofcoffee.com/

I also suggest looking st the visuals page on the website and read into the versions which have a lot of AI references

When you get to the front page you'll notice the paragraph and

""The preservation of life and the advancement of technology are not mutually exclusive but are intertwined in a complex and beautiful MIDNIGHT BALLET.  Coffee brings together diverse flavors to create a harmonious experience, expressing the conceptual metaphor.  File Systems of Coffee invites us into a narrative where past and future converge, urging us to cherish and protect life's essence. That Part Where Artistry and Engineering are Inseparable""

Which immediately gave pgLang vibes and even reminded me of the Mr. Morale website

https://pg-lang.com/


https://oklama.com/

The above statements even seemed similar to pgLangs mission statement which you will find on their website at the bottom on Welcome to pgLang.

Then I noticed the video underneath titled midnight ballet and it looked straight up like a Dave Free joint. Same vibes

https://youtu.be/R1PB-8mBRJU?si=fnI2DwdjpSpKTpa-

There's a lot in the imagery and words being spoke and for brevity I will not break it down here but will explore this in the comment section (one of which is his mention of creating an ark, which seems like a Noah reference right?) but something else stood out to me. The male narrator sounded an awful lot like Donald Glover.. but he was not listed in the credits so I wrote it off.

But when you go to their YouTube they have only one other video, a short

https://youtube.com/shorts/AFxKcmJCqjM?si=qVFekltQhLArqOBQ

A few things stick out here like the back alley portion and the space imagery, and the pictures made in the drinks.. like the cowboy hat and heart..

So then I poked around more and found they also have an accompanying Spotify playlist

https://open.spotify.com/playlist/767V2vMvHJcaoLGwbntVTO?si=W1euevK6RzOfr99VMyFq4Q&pi=imL_7BDPQkSME

The songs included are interesting but nothing I recognized until I saw the Childish Gambino song ""No excuses"" and now somehow it's all starting make sense.

So now I'm locked in right. I wanted to know more so I continued to poke around on the website and found the press page which included the article mentioned above and a weird review by a La Marzocco.. wait like lamars?? Nah surely that's a weird coincidence right.. well maybe because it appears to be espresso machines..

Well let's take a look at the website linked..

https://lamarzoccousa.com/news/blog/file-systems-of-coffee-los-angeles/


I encourage you to read the entire write up, because lyrics jump out st me left and right but this paragraph was particularly interesting

""Royce Rollins: My team is trained to keep things simplistic. We don‚Äôt hit you over the head with our concept; we want you to explore this space, and discover the rabbit hole of references at your own leisure. One way to explain what we do is we‚Äôre an internet cafe with a straight face. We‚Äôre the new internet cafe. And that means many different things.  ""

To discover the rabbit hole of references at your own leisure.. feels like a bit of a foot stomp to me..

So then I finally found who owned this place and decided to take a look into Royce Rollins and ended up at his website which includes his vast resume of clients


https://www.roycerollins.com/software

Oddly enough the first thing mentioned flight club which started as an Ebay business selling shoes and immediately my first thought was the ebay black AF1s from Watch the Party Die.

So okay how does this tie into drake or Kendrick,

Well Royce worked with Livenation(Drake co owns ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù in toronto with them, they unexpectedly cancelled ScHoolboy and SiR shows after the Pop Out and worked with Disney until 2022, similar time to when they collabed with Drake on OVO merch.. but a lot of people work together with similar companies.. so I wanted to see where else this could take us and that's when u/lady_moscato had the idea to Google Royce Rollins and Calmatic of the Squabble up mv and while we couldn't exactly see calmatic we believe more SEO led us here

https://www.artoholiks.com/capabilities-5-2/

We noticed more space imagery along with clients of artoholiks one of which being Urban burger Cranford which seems pretty run of the mill to be honest until you get to this part 

https://urbanburgercranford.com/discover-our-menu/

It's was pointed out the random collection of posters on the wall.. Kill Bill, Ghost busters, Wizard of oz, and friends, space jam and bobs burgers... 

Crazy Scary Spooky Hilarious?

Anyway so a reoccurring theme(among many) is AI and the desire to get back the basics ala pgLang, even the Spotify playlist is titled ""A real Connection in a post AI world"". 

Why is this important? Simply put American has A(I) problem..

https://genius.com/Beyonce-america-has-a-problem-remix-lyrics

Let's look at it in terms of the original Space Jam, where the threat of being forced to entertain for all of eternity with no control is what was at stake.

Are the Ark and Noah references telling us to get back to the basics before it's too late? Sounds a lot like what File systems of coffee and pgLang are trying to accomplish. 

I encourage you to dive into what AI has started to take over, such as the lyrics you read (musikmatch on Spotify, embedded) The images and videos you see, even some of the comments and posts you see on social media and unfortunately at times here. 

I'm going to stop here for your sake but follow up a part two later this week.

I would love to see what all you guys can find and the other REAL connections that are made.

Thank you and much appreciation if you made it this far.

1ibdlow,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ibdlow/is_an_informal_interview_at_the_beginning_of_the/,"Is an ""informal"" interview at the beginning of the interview process normal?","Hello! I will graduate in a few months with my MBA, so have been applying for Associate roles at Consulting firms. One of my previous managers referred me to a specific firm with an open position because they had worked with the CEO of the firm in the past. It is relatively small firm (\~5 people total). Anyway, I heard back from them last week and they wanted to set up an ""informal"" interview at a local coffee shop. The way it was phrased in the email, it sounds like there will be a more formal interview later on if the informal interview goes well.

I have heard of more informal interviews like this happening later on in the interview process - like as the last step; however, I've never heard of one happening at the beginning. Has anybody experienced or heard of this before? Is it a red flag? Are they just trying to determine whether it would be a good personality fit before proceeding with a formal interview? Are they meeting with me simply as a courtesy since a previous manager referred me?

If the additional context helps - the initial email contained the contact info for the person I was supposed to connect with to set up the meeting. I reached out and we agreed on a time/date and they suggested a few different coffee shops in the area that we could meet at. The reason I think this detail may be important is that it suggests they aren't meeting with multiple candidates back to back (as I've experienced in the past).

Sorry if this comes off as a dumb question - I've just never been through this process with a Consulting firm and everyone I've asked has only seen these informal interviews coming at a later stage in the process.

With this new machine I'm noticing that the manual stop (1 cup or 2 cup button) is not working sometimes and the espresso will continue to come out for another 3-4 seconds.

Once I have the portafilter, I hit the 2 cup button for a double shot. Once the timer on the machine reaches close to 30 seconds, I'll press the 2 cup button again to manually stop it. But about 25% of the time, the machine won't stop producing espresso and will keep running for another 4 or so seconds giving me close to 40g of espresso.

Strangely enough, when the portafilter is empty (without any coffee grinds), the manual stop works 100% of the time.

I've tried resetting the machine and it's still the same thing. My previous Barista Express and Pro didn't have this issue.

I've reached out to Breville support and I was told that this is the way the Automatic function works but I don't believe this is true.

Hey everyone! I‚Äôm about to start an internship in Equity Research this summer and have heard that it‚Äôs incredibly valuable to network prior to starting the work.

However, as you can imagine, people are very busy right now, since the first half of the year is a busy period for people in ER and I find myself stuck since I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll miss out on networking with the people I‚Äôll be working with prior to the internship but at the same time, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the best option to reach out knowing that they are very busy (I reached out to somebody already and was told that that was the case). Obviously I want to network and get tips on how to be my best self for the job, but I also don‚Äôt want to be known as the ‚Äòintern who kept asking for coffee chats during busy season‚Äô even before starting the job.

Would appreciate any advice/guidance on what you think the best approach would be.

Thanks a lot and have a nice day! ",1,1737995867.0,FinancialCareers,4,1.0,False

I had been feeling for a while that our relationship wasn't working, but something that weekend pushed me over the edge, and I finally walked away. Like most relationships, ours was great in the beginning. We started dating mid-pandemic and bonded very quickly. I guess we ""moved fast"" because not even a year into our relationship, I moved in with him and his roommates. Not long after, we adopted a dog and everything just felt like it was moving in the right direction.  
There were a few red flags in the beginning, but no one is perfect so I chose to ignore them. Not long after moving in and getting the dog together, it was clear that he expected me to do everything. Cook his dinner, do the dishes, do the laundry, walk/feed/play/pay for the dog, etc. Maybe it was the bliss of being in my first long-term relationship (plus the constant talk of getting engaged) that kept me doing everything, but it quickly got old and only got worse when we moved out of the place where we lived with his roommates and moved into our own place. I'll take the blame for that because I should have told him early on that we SHARE the chores and should have put my foot down, but I didn't. Once we were alone, it was clear how little he prioritized our relationship and more specifically my feelings.

I have had anxiety and depression since I was 15. Not that it was up to him to make sure I was happy 24/7, but there were a lot of times where he just didn't seem to care about my happiness at all. I don't have many friends in the area, so a lot of my time and energy was centered around him. Almost every night, I would make him dinner, we would eat together, and then he would go upstairs and play video games until it was time for bed where he would just be on his phone until it was time to sleep. I brought it up to him more than once how lonely I felt, and he told me ""your happiness is not my problem."" and the more I would bring up concerns in our relationship, the angrier he could get. It was clear he was annoyed with my emotions so eventually I stopped bringing them up.  
One thing I couldn't ignore was how he spoke to me. I know every couple has their issues, but the way he spoke to me on a daily basis was disgusting. He spoke to me like I was beneath him. The words he would say, his tone, everything wasn't okay in my eyes for someone to speak to their significant other. And when I would bring it up? I would be dismissed as being sensitive. There has been times where he's told me to ""shut up"", ""shut your mouth"", claimed I was ""a miserable person to be around,"" and that my ""attitude was ruining our relationship"". Sure, I'm sure over the past few months I haven't been a peach to be around, but I didn't get there on my own. Not to mention all the times he's called me ""stupid"" or the r-slur just when I didn't say something the right way or said something he didn't agree with. Politics was a whole other issue. We have different political views and in the beginning, he was fine with it but this last election was awful. He's also made fun of my appearance for things he knows I'm sensitive about. I've struggled with my weight since high school and my constant weight fluctuations have caused my breasts to sag to the point where it causes me to have back issues. He LOVED to make comments about how much they sag. But of course, now he claims that was ""just a joke.""  
Fast forward to this past week. After I ended things, I packed up a small bag and went to live with a family member. I asked for space and time to think clearly about what I want and what is right for me. He texted me every day. If I had to go back to the house while he was at work to grab some more things, he would write me letters. He even had coffee delivered to me where I was staying. He tells me he can be better and how much he loves me. That he regrets treating me the way he has and he sees it now. He's begging for another chance and if it doesn't work out, he'll let me go.

But the thing is, I don't want to try again. I have poured my heart and soul into this relationship without receiving anything back. He was not an affectionate person while we were together and would only kiss me before bed each night or when he wanted sex. He never came to any of my family gatherings or was my date for my friends weddings, but I always did that for him. His disrespect is one thing, but there is so much more he has done over the last 4 years that makes me not want to keep trying and trying and trying.

He's saying all the right things because of course he is. I see he's hurting, but when we talk its always about what HE wants, never what I want. I know I was the selfish one for ending things, but its because I have never put myself first in this relationship. I'm scared that the guilt of leaving and hurting him will make me give in to his needs and stay. He told me walking away was the easy option, but it wasn't. Staying would be easy and I just don't think that's best for me anymore.

I don't want him to hurt, but I've been hurting all these years. How do I feel good about my decision and not give in because it's what he wants? Is it worth trying again?",1,1737995790.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1ibd9t4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ibd9t4,From First Glance to Years Together: My PlayStation Journey,"I remember that day like it was yesterday. I walked into some gaming club to trade my Sega Genesis cartridges, but the place was packed, and everyone was crowded around one TV. I looked at the screen and couldn‚Äôt understand what game was on. A door slowly opened against a dark background, and then I saw a 3D character with a gun walking through the gloomy corridors of some mansion. Ahead, there were zombies. The character stopped, aimed, and began shooting at the zombie, which barely reacted to the shots‚Ä¶ That was my first encounter with PSX and the game Resident Evil 1.


I‚Äôve already mentioned that I loved horror games. What I saw on the screen was hundreds of times cooler than anything I had ever played. From that moment on, I was completely obsessed with the idea of getting a PSX. It wasn‚Äôt even a dream‚Äîit was an obsession.


Now, a little about the reality of those times. A small math problem: The PlayStation in Tashkent cost $300. The combined salary of both my parents was around $400. Now think about the chances of a child getting this console. None!


For the first year, my friends and I spent our time in gaming clubs, playing for 30-60 minutes a day after school. I always preferred story-driven games, but playing those in a crowded club was impossible. Plus, I didn‚Äôt have enough money to play solo, so my friends and I pooled our money to play Tekken 2, Tobal, and of course, Twisted Metal 2. Since the console arrived much later in our city than everywhere else, I had never even seen the first parts of these game series. The console only started being sold after it was cracked, and all the discs in the city were pirated. Pirates didn‚Äôt see the point of releasing the first installments of these game series. Interestingly, a few clubs decided to take the risk and set up Panasonic 3DO, and I even saw a Sega Saturn in one. But they couldn‚Äôt match the success of PSX, and the owners quickly switched to PSX.


I continued going to the market, trading Sega Genesis games, as I still wanted to be able to play single-player games at home. The money I made from trading Sega Genesis cartridges helped me afford club time. All the guys at the market had become my acquaintances, and PSX consoles and a huge number of games for it started appearing on their makeshift stalls. I spent more and more time at the market, watching new games for the new console and listening to the stories from the vendors who were already deep into PlayStation games.


But I wouldn‚Äôt say I stopped enjoying my time with Sega Genesis. My brain had somehow set standards for old and new games, and I still marveled at the graphics on the 16-bit console, considering it was much weaker than PlayStation.


Over a year passed, and I couldn‚Äôt even dream of owning a new console, but I still woke up and fell asleep thinking about it. It was the beginning of summer, and my parents had sent me to buy bread for breakfast. That‚Äôs when I unexpectedly ran into a friend I hadn‚Äôt seen in years. His father was one of the best gynecologists in our country, and he was offered a contract in Israel, where he moved with his family. A few years later, he decided to return to Uzbekistan. My friend was three years older than me and had already started preparing for medical school. His father bought him a personal computer for his studies. Back then, owning a personal computer was considered way above having a PlayStation. A powerful PC cost over $1000, and only the privileged few could afford it. My friend started telling me all the perks of owning a computer, and how in Israel he had a PlayStation, which his father bought for him right after its release. But he said it was nothing compared to all the capabilities of a PC.


I immediately asked him if he was planning to sell his PlayStation, since he wasn‚Äôt using it much anymore. He said he was actually planning to do just that. It turned out that in Israel, he only had a few discs because games were very expensive. But when he returned to Tashkent and saw that, after modding the console, games were available for just $2 instead of the 40-60 dollars they cost in Israel, his father immediately chipped the console and bought a huge number of games. So with a set including the console, two controllers, five memory cards, and over a hundred games, he was ready to part with it for just $100. The problem was, I had no time to think, as I was the first to hear that attractive price.


For the first time in my life, I, being a rather calm kid who never asked my parents for anything, stormed into the apartment and blurted out that I desperately needed to borrow $100. I started explaining that the set was worth much more, and that I could sell my Sega Genesis with all its cartridges, and later sell the memory cards and discs from this royal package to pay off the debt in a few weeks. My parents were shocked by my insistence. Even though my father didn‚Äôt approve much of my gaming obsession, he was proud that my hobby brought me some income, and I could do without pocket money by earning everything I needed through games. Seeing that I wasn‚Äôt begging like most of my peers for a new console, but simply asking for a loan, he quickly agreed. And that very evening, I became the happiest teenager in the world‚Äîbecause ahead of me was the entire summer, and standing next to my TV was MY very own Sony PlayStation, with the shelf full of games for it. That was probably the happiest day of my life. No other day, before or after, made me feel like that.


How about you? When and how did you get your Sony PlayStation? Was it a gift, or was it the first console you bought yourself? Share your story‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear about how you began your PSX era.

1ibd4uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1ibd4uw/discouraging_date/,Discouraging Date,"Midwestern M31 here, and a girl matched with a prompt of mine on Hinge last week. We‚Äôve had a pretty lively conversation for a couple days and decided to grab coffee after church on Sunday. Rarely does anyone initiate the way she did and even more rarely does it result in a date. We both have very similar passionate views and beliefs. Years ago i unfortunately ‚Äúdeconstructed‚Äù and left the church for a while and tried secular dating. That was the only time I‚Äôve ever had any luck getting a second date. I guess that makes sense because Christian‚Äôs tend to have higher standards with the intention that we are finding somebody for LIFE. Anyway it had been over a year since I‚Äôve had a date and in the past I would of thought she was ‚Äúout of my league‚Äù but I‚Äôve been building my confidence this past year, and she was so goofy and friendly I thought I may have had a chance. I knew if it didn‚Äôt work I‚Äôd be hurt so I‚Äôve had my friends and family praying for me that if it would work out and that if it didn‚Äôt work out I would handle it well and move on. 

Well the date was fun, slightly awkward at the very end and I got the follow-up message last night that she doesn‚Äôt feel I‚Äôm the right match. Suffice it to say, I am not handling it well. I‚Äôm beyond discouraged and hurt and all the cliches about how she‚Äôs just not the right one and God has that person out there who will come at the right time don‚Äôt help. Thankfully she didn‚Äôt just ghost me and was nice about it. I still have my faith and in conversation with God. I‚Äôm angry at him though and myself. I wish maybe I had lower standards? But I don‚Äôt and probably put her on too much of a pedestal but I don‚Äôt know how not to do that. I‚Äôve never secured a 2nd date with another Christian and it‚Äôs so discouraging. I‚Äôm willing to pray for, and make whatever changes I need, to find the right one but I feel so lost. I wasn‚Äôt even really looking this time when she appeared in my life. Please if you have any advice I need it because every date I‚Äôve had makes the next one harder to be optimistic about and I have to put more faith in God each time just for it to not work out.

My package was delivered but I never received it. I sent an email advising of the situation that the tracking says it was delivered but nothing was delivered to my door. I got a response later that day telling me to file a claim with the shipping company. This was already a disappointing response. I've had other roasters send me new beans no questions asked when I have had issues with delivery. One time customs cut open my beans and they sent me a new shipment. Regardless, I wasn't going to make a fuss about it and contacted the shipper.

They confirmed on the phone that the driver delivered it to the wrong building. They said they would try to retrieve the package and redeliver.  I advised September Coffee and said I will keep them posted. The shipper called me the next week to claim that they retrieved the package and redelivered the Friday prior but again, I received nothing. I explained this to them and they said I will have to contact the roaster and they need to file a claim.

This was Jan 16th. I emailed September advising of the situation. 6 days passed and I received no response. I emailed them again on the 22nd. Still no response. I sent a follow up on the 23rd asking if I could get a refund or new coffee sent. It's now the 27th and no response. Not sure what conclusion I'm to come to other than I'm being ghosted. Do they think I'm trying to scam them for free coffee or something? Pretty disappointing since I spent over $400 on just coffee from them in 2024.

As for Anastasia, she‚Äôs the creative genius behind our new Journal feature and is putting the final touches on the upcoming revamped Blood Pressure Analysis (post coming soon ‚Äî stay tuned!). Like any great designer, she‚Äôs been testing everything herself, which means she‚Äôs gotten really into measuring her BP and tracking all sorts of habits. Insights followed: even 2 cups of coffee don‚Äôt push her BP higher than optimal, and playing piano helps her de-stress and refocus (also, she‚Äôs incredibly good at it.) She now sneaks in 10-15 minutes of piano between tasks and calls to give her creativity an extra boost.

So, I have super old acne discoloration on my cheeks from my teen years that I've just lived with. I tried Rx retinols and at-home micro dermabrasion. After seeing a video about IPL, I purchased a Groupon for 2 IPL sessions.

The sessions went OK. I spaced them about 2 months apart. The second one was about 3 months ago. Today, I don't see ANY results from those sessions. I know she did the first session super light because I was nervous about horror stories of being burned. With the second session I had a couple tiny spots that got the coffee grounds, but once they flaked off, they still look the same.

I understand that the process can take time, and I liked the person I saw, so I bought another Groupon. However, their IPL broke and it sounds like it's going to take forever for them to get a new one. They offered to substitute a Fotona laser peel. I did a bit of research, and this seems like a more serious procedure with more time spent looking unsightly. I guess I'm willing to do it if others think it will give good results. I have super fair skin and the acne discoloration isn't horrible. I have a couple small age spots in there as well. I don't really want a full-face treatment for general anti-aging, I just want these spots gone.

1ibd2hl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ibd2hl,Falkor's story (no Websters),"Falkor was surrendered to a shelter in another state because he was ill in March 2023 when he was 3 years old. At least that was the owner's story. He had a huge cyst on the side of his neck and the owner said that he wouldn't eat because of that. Turns out that was a lie, as he ate like a horse and gained 11lbs his first week at the shelter. Once he gained a little weight,  a vet was able to remove the cyst. He was anxious and very stressed at the shelter.

My husband and I had lost the last of our pack (2 labs & 2 basset hounds) the previous December. And found ourselves without a dog for the first time in 23 years. Once we decided we were ready for another dog in May 2023, we went to several shelters and just couldn't find  one that felt right for us. About this time, a friend of my husband adopted a dog from a local bully breed rescue.  He told us that the rescue didn't have a physical shelter to house dogs and depended on volunteers to foster the dogs until they were adopted.  He thought that this was something we should try until we did find a dog of our own. We immediately applied to be fosters and we're approved. A week later, the rescue was able to pull Falkor (his name was Jupifer at the time, but we changed it) and bring him to us.

We had Falkor for a few weeks so he could decompress from shelter life. In this time, we experienced a few things that led us to believe he had not only been starved, but physically abused as well. I caught him chewing on the coffee table one day, I raised my voice a bit when I told him no and called him bad dog. He stopped chewing and ran from the room as fast as he could. I went to check on him and he hung his head and cowered from me with his eyes closed and shaking like he expected to be hit. I felt so bad. I got on the floor and hugged him and told him he was a good dog and that he had just done something naughty. Another time, a bee got in the house and as my husband swatted at it, Falkor responded the same way, like he was expecting to be hit. I cry every time I think of anyone actually hitting him. After his decompression period,  we took him to his first adoption event. Many people were interested in him. On the way home, my husband was unusually quiet. I asked him what was wrong. He asked me what I thought about keeping Falkor. I was over the moon! By this time I was already in love with the sweet boy! My husband said that he just wanted to tell people to get away from our dog at the adoption event. So the next day, 7/3/23, we signed the adoption contract and became foster failures. Falkor was officially our good dog!

The first picture is the day that he was surrendered at the shelter and weighed only 38lbs. The second picture is last month at 90lbs, with his little brother Zinc on the left and foster brother Jude on the right. The last 2 pictures are the remaining schedule for voting for the America's Favorite Pet contest. You can vote for free once every 24 hours. We're currently on the round to select the top 10 from each group and Falkor is in 2nd place so far. He sends love and sloppy kisses to everyone that throws him a vote!

Morocco, with its stunning landscapes, vibrant culture, and rich history, is a dream destination for many. But responsible travel is crucial to preserving its beauty for future generations.  This guide will show you how to explore Morocco sustainably, minimizing your environmental footprint and maximizing your positive impact.

**Before You Go: Planning for a Greener Trip**

* **Choose Sustainable Transportation:**  Flying has a significant carbon footprint. Consider alternative routes like taking a train ‚Äì Morocco's train system is improving and offers scenic journeys.  Once in Morocco, opt for local buses, grand taxis (shared taxis), or walking whenever possible. Renting a bike in certain cities can also be a fun and eco-friendly option.
* **Pack Light:** Less luggage means less fuel consumption during transport.  Pack versatile clothing items that can be mixed and matched, and utilize laundry services if necessary.
* **Eco-Friendly Accommodation:** Look for eco-lodges, riads (traditional Moroccan houses converted into guesthouses) with sustainable practices, or guesthouses that prioritize water conservation and waste reduction.  Read reviews and check for certifications like Green Globe or similar.
* **Responsible Tour Operators:** Research tour operators committed to sustainable tourism. Look for companies that support local communities, minimize environmental impact, and employ ethical practices.

**During Your Trip: Minimizing Your Footprint**

* **Conserve Water:** Morocco faces water scarcity in many areas.  Take shorter showers, reuse towels, and be mindful of your water consumption.
* **Reduce Waste:** Say no to single-use plastics.  Carry a reusable water bottle, shopping bag, and coffee cup.  Support local businesses that prioritize waste reduction.
* **Respect Local Culture and Environment:**  Learn a few basic Arabic phrases to show respect.  Avoid disturbing wildlife and stick to marked trails when hiking.  Respect local customs and traditions.
* **Support Local Businesses:** Patronize locally-owned businesses, restaurants, and shops.  This helps to distribute tourism revenue fairly and supports the local economy.  Choose souvenirs made from sustainable materials.
* **Offset Your Carbon Footprint:** While minimizing your impact is key, consider offsetting your remaining carbon emissions through reputable carbon offsetting programs.
* **Be a Responsible Tourist:**  Respect the environment and the local culture. Don't litter, and be mindful of your noise levels, especially in quieter areas.


**Specific Tips for Morocco:**

* **Experience Traditional Cooking Classes:**  Many eco-lodges and guesthouses offer cooking classes using locally sourced ingredients. This is a fantastic way to engage with the local culture and minimize your food miles.
* **Explore Traditional Markets (Souks) Mindfully:**  Souks can be incredibly exciting, but resist the temptation to buy items made from endangered species or unsustainable materials.  Shop consciously and support ethical vendors.
* **Visit National Parks Responsibly:**  Morocco has stunning national parks.  Stick to designated trails, avoid disturbing wildlife, and leave no trace behind.


**Sustainable Travel Doesn't Mean Sacrificing Fun!**

Sustainable travel in Morocco doesn't mean compromising on your experience. In fact, it often enhances it!  By choosing responsible options, you'll have the opportunity to connect more deeply with the local culture, appreciate the beauty of the environment, and contribute positively to the country's future.  So, pack your bags, embrace sustainable practices, and get ready for an unforgettable and responsible Moroccan adventure!
Remember to research specific regions you're visiting for any local initiatives or guidelines to ensure you're making the most informed and responsible choices.
Happy travels!

1ibcuz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1ibcuz3/adhd_or_anxiety/,ADHD or Anxiety?,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm reaching out to this community because I‚Äôm feeling uncertain about my diagnosis and would appreciate your insights. My psychiatrist diagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but I often wonder if my experiences might align more with ADHD. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my symptoms and struggles:

1. Difficulty with consistency:
I made ambitious plans this semester‚Äîworking on my thesis, studying for board exams, completing a physical education course (90 min/week gym requirement), etc. But I failed to accomplish any of them. I also couldn‚Äôt complete the syllabus for my two university exams and didn‚Äôt even attend them. I feel like I‚Äôve wasted the semester.


2. Slow study pace:
I study much slower than my peers, and not starting early enough triggered crippling anxiety attacks. Even clonazepam didn‚Äôt help, and I missed my exams.


3. Poor time management:
I tried cooking twice daily to save money, but this left me no time for consistent studying.


4. Time blindness:
I constantly underestimate how long tasks will take. This has been a recurring pattern throughout university.


5. Study distractions:
When I try to study, I can focus initially, but anxious thoughts about potential failures take over, derailing my progress.


6. Childhood trauma:
When studying, intrusive thoughts about past trauma surface. I often need company to drown these out, which affects my coursework.


7. Dependency on stimulants:
I rely on coffee to focus, but strong caffeine (like energy drinks) worsens my anxiety, causing physical symptoms like chest pain, sweating, and difficulty breathing.


8. Dependency on others:
I feel extremely anxious when alone. I stay on video calls with my LDR boyfriend all day, but I also have recurring fears of betrayal, leading to fights.


9. Coping with avoidance:
On busy days, I find it hard to get out of bed. I end up scrolling for hours, avoiding the anxiety of facing my responsibilities.



My psychiatrist believes my thoughts are more organized than what he‚Äôs seen in ADHD patients, leading him to diagnose me with GAD. Currently, I‚Äôm on Sertraline (100 mg, recently increased from 50 mg) and Clonazepam (0.5 mg twice daily). Despite this, I‚Äôve had severe panic attacks and episodes of endless crying over the last few days, which led to me missing my exams.

I‚Äôve now decided to focus on my mental health and take it slow. My plan is to prioritize university subjects and start preparing notes early for the next exam period.

Another layer to this: I have severe flight anxiety, and I‚Äôm traveling in 4 days to visit my family. I lied to my parents (typical South Asian ones) about passing my exams to avoid further stress.

I‚Äôll be meeting my psychiatrist again on February 13. In the meantime, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts:

Do my symptoms resonate with your experience of ADHD?

Could this all be explained by anxiety alone?


Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and for any feedback you can provide!

1ibcuc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/KusuriyaNoHitorigoto/comments/1ibcuc4/interview_with_shino_touko_the_illustrator_for/,"Interview with Shino Touko, the illustrator for the Apothecary Diaries light novel","**‚ÄúShino Touko's Diaries‚Äù**

*- ‚ÄúI got into drawing because of a diary exchange.‚Äù-*

Everyone in my family likes to make things. Moreover, I have liked drawing and handicraft ever since I was a child. The very first anime and manga that I liked was ‚ÄúRanma 1/2‚Äù by Rumiko Takahashi. I used to draw Ranma and Akane in my notebook a lot during elementary school.¬†



That's why, when I met Hidaka Noriko, the voice actress of Akane, during the dubbing of the ‚ÄúApothecary Diaries‚Äù anime, I was so deeply moved that I thought to myself, ‚ÄúWhat the heck is even going on?‚Äù.¬†

One of the biggest catalysts for my pursuit of drawing was when I joined the TRPG club in high school ‚Äî I found myself in an environment where my peers and I would draw in each other's sketchbooks.¬†

We would bring our own sketchbooks, draw a character in it, and pass it around, then receive it back, filled with several character illustrations in it, just like an exchange diary.¬†

Due to such inspirations from my peers, my high school days turned out to be the most engrossed in drawing I had ever been.¬†

I think the experience from that time really became a driving force for me to keep pursuing art later as a career.



*- ‚ÄúWhen I read ‚ÄúThe Apothecary Diaries‚Äù for the first time‚Äù-*

Reading ‚ÄúThe Apothecary Diaries‚Äù for the first time was such a fresh experience. Maomao's character was eccentric and gave a bright and frank aura. It felt so unique when compared to other novels set in the inner palace.

When all that foreshadowing, that was casually spread out, suddenly came at once at the end of volume 1, it was exhilarating. Understanding better the nature of each character through the course of many episodes and the parts focusing on multiple POVs as an ensemble cast drama were also good and made for a thrilling read.



*-‚ÄúThe design that I thought about the most‚Äù-*

When it comes to character design, the first step I take is to imagine what the character will be like if there was a manga, anime, or even drama adaptation.¬†

I always keep in mind that, in case an adaptation to another media is made, the character should be easily transferable.

I think Maomao's design was the one that took me the longest. Although, I wrote on page 18 ‚ÄúSince she has to do washing and compounding, she wouldn‚Äôt have many ornaments‚Äù, I feel her clothes ended up quite plain. My thought process was like, ‚ÄúSince she is constantly jumping from place-to-place gathering herbs, wouldn‚Äôt her clothes get all dirty? Plus, it's not in her character to be interested in looking attractive‚Äù.¬†

But I felt disappointed in how unremarkable her design had turned out. Naturally, I wanted her to leave some kind of impression as the protagonist, so I turned my attention to her hairstyle. My goal was to give her a trait that would make her recognizable even when adapted to another media.

In that era, being devoted and submissive was a big matter of concern. So, I thought, ‚Äúwhat if I give her a more modern hairstyle?‚Äù. Now, I feel confident with this more casual design, but, initially, my heart would beat from worrying whether it was good or not.

I have, of course, received some corrections, but I feel there has never been a case where a design that I submitted was received with a ‚Äúthis is fundamentally wrong‚Äù. However, I remember that when I submitted a draft for Jinshi where he had a gentler and more feminine aura, I was oriented to change it to a more handsome one. The episodes related to Consort Ah-Duo are coming, recently her personality has become more noticeable, with that, I can see that her current aura was the right choice.

*-The characters I'm attached to‚Äù-*

Gyokuyou left a deep impression on me, in part, since she was the first character with Inner Palace garment that I designed (Page 30 for reference). On top of becoming Maomao's ally, she always gives this ‚Äúgood person‚Äù aura, so, she has always been a very likable character. The Jade Pavilion as a whole gives the type of comfort that makes someone feel at home.

(Characters that haven't appeared in the anime yet)

>!Another character that left an impression on me was Tianyu (Page 124 for reference). He's the type of character you never know whether he's being serious or fooling around, so I gave my all to come up with a design that would reflect this quirk. I was worried about being rejected, but I ended up not receiving any corrections (Haha). Chue's design process was also fun (Page 80). My first impression of her when reading was that she would move in a way like ‚ÄúArale from Dr. Slump‚Äù and ‚ÄúPatalliro‚Äù. Once I saw she was short, I pictured her moving with her legs rolling. I could even imagine her emitting sound effects while moving (Haha).!<



*-‚ÄùMy favorite scenery to draw is day-to-day life‚Äù-*

The type of illustration that I like to do is something like the Jade Pavilion Ladies-in-Waiting having tea in volume 1 (Page 33). After drawing a simple day-to-day life moment for the first time, I realized this is the type of mood that I like to draw. >!Furthermore, during the Western Capital arc in volume 9, that scene where they are chattering while shopping, with Lakan having fun while Maomao is fed up (Page 102), I like drawing this type of ordinary scene.!< One type that was surprisingly challenging to draw were the ‚ÄúTalks around a table‚Äù ones. Volume 1 has a lot of these scenes, so I used different types of compositions, changing things like camera angles and how the characters sit so that they wouldn't all feel the same.

With no surprises, the type of scene with the most reaction is Maomao and Jinshi two shots. After these scenes, I receive numerous letters from the readers, and the collabs create a buzz on social media.

A drawing that I want to draw one day, ignoring my ‚Äúprocessing power‚Äù (Haha), is a big character gathering. After coming up with so many wonderful characters, I wonder how big would be an illustration with all of them. Besides, I would like to try drawing young versions of the older characters. The granny, the quack doctor. Wouldn't that be fun? I think it would also be fun drawing the Three Princess in their younger years, with a more cute vibe.

*-‚ÄùI decide on a composition after thoroughly digesting it‚Äù-*

One thing that I'm always particular about doing when it comes to drawing is taking some time to digest a request and try to comprehend in my own way. Thereafter, I decide the composition while thinking about various things like: ‚ÄúHow do I express this? Should I just draw this directly, or is it better to make some changes?‚Äù¬†

I end up spending a lot of time doing this, and occasionally, it messes up my schedule (Haha). I try not to overdo it, but at the same time, I want to include at least something that I came up with. It's fun because you only notice once you are already doing it.

*-‚ÄùMusic and tea are my companions while drawing‚Äù-*

Once I start drawing, it feels mostly like ‚Äúwork‚Äù, so I avoid listening to intense music for the most part and go for soundtracks of anime and movies. Moreover, for me, electronic music, with its high and constant rhythm, is perfect for work. Recently, I have been listening to Sakanaction. The sound is so pleasing, it's perfect to concentrate while working at night.¬†

Besides, Tsuneta Daiki, from millennium parade and King Gnu, has been collaborating with several artists in different projects, and I've been listening to these as well. I like music so much, before I realized my Mac was filled with it.¬†

I like to have some tea while drawing. Too much coffee would destroy my stomach. So, I buy some economic packs of Yellow Label from Lipton, or Nittoh Tea, and frequently drink it while working.

*-‚ÄùLooking back at 10 years of ‚ÄòThe Apothecary Diaries‚Äô‚Äù-*

This year, it has been 10 years since the first volume was published in 2014. A manga adaptation, drama CDs, an anime adaptation, the world of ‚ÄúThe Apothecary Diaries‚Äù has become so much bigger, the number of people involved continues to grow, as well the parts they get involved in, it's so exciting. Specially, hearing the characters for the first time gave them even more depth and was such a remarkable experience.

I have always been the type of person that focuses wholeheartedly on what is ahead of me, so I'm glad I was blessed with this opportunity to publish an art book and look back at my previous works. It's quite heartwarming.

This probably doesn‚Äôt come as a surprise to the readers, but I am deeply grateful to Natsu Hyuuga, the one that brought forth this world, and accepted the clumsy me with an open heart, ‚ÄúThank you very much‚Äù and ‚ÄúI look forward to continuing to work with you‚Äù.

Looking at this art book again, there are many color illustrations, and it turned out to be a splendid volume. Some illustrations from around volume 1 have a few embarrassing parts, but (Haha), if the readers enjoy it, I‚Äôm glad.
