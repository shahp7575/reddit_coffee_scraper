Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day ü§≠. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath ü§ó.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. 

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

A little info about me so you know I'm not just a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play video games. I'm obsessed with Satisfactory at the moment.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 6 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

Switzerland is known for innovation, finance, and forward-thinking entrepreneurs‚Äîbut sometimes, finding the *right connections* can feel like a challenge. That‚Äôs why I wanted to open up this conversation and see who else here is interested in entrepreneurs networking across Switzerland.

Whether you‚Äôre based in Zurich, Geneva, Basel, Bern, or even a smaller city, networking can be a game-changer. Meeting like-minded entrepreneurs gives you access to new opportunities, collaborations, and resources you might not find on your own. Sometimes the best ideas and partnerships come from casual conversations over coffee‚Äîor at organized networking meetups.

I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who has already joined networking groups or events in Switzerland. Are there specific meetups, co-working spaces, or conferences that you‚Äôve found valuable? If you‚Äôre new to the scene, what kind of networking opportunities would you like to see more of‚Äîformal events, informal meetups, or industry-specific gatherings?

Let‚Äôs use this thread to connect, share ideas, and maybe even organize something together. Switzerland has such a vibrant entrepreneurial community, and it would be great to see it grow stronger through collaboration.

1mxgx98,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1mxgx98/my_arms_are_warm/,My Arms Are Warm,"Every three seconds, it happened. Over and over again.

First, the ping from the wireless mobile charger. Then the monotonous rhythm of rain against the kitchen window. Finally, the lightning strike that pushed Amanda back again.

Like being trapped in a looping reel.

But with a twist: the only things that didn‚Äôt repeat were her own thoughts and reactions. Plus the warmth building in her arms, lingering even as everything else reset.

How could this be? Maybe the wi-fi signal and the lightning, somehow, had torn a ripple in space-time. Or perhaps the storm had rewired her nervous system, resulting in a distorted perception. Or ‚Äî this idea lingered ‚Äî some cosmically karmic punishment.

It didn‚Äôt matter. What mattered was finding ANY way to avoid the strike and break the cycle.

She leapt left, right, forward, backward. Threw herself flat on the floor. Climbed onto the counter. Then came the emotions: she screamed, cursed, cried, laughed, pulled faces, and sang.

Her first composed song went something like:

‚ÄúWhat have I done‚Ä¶
BZZZZZ!
‚Ä¶ to deseeeerrve‚Äî
BZZZZZ!
‚Ä¶ THIS!!!‚Äù

Then she had a different idea. If the ‚Äùflash/wi-fi theory‚Äù was correct, maybe she couldn‚Äôt escape the strike itself ‚Äî but she might escape the respawn. After all, death would be a relief compared to this.

So she yanked the charger in time, once, triumphant for a heartbeat‚Ä¶ until the loop snapped back. The charger took the hit as always, humming indifferently, as if it only cared about staying on ‚Äî not whether Amanda did.

So, no matter what, she woke in the same place, at the same instant: her own kitchen.

After a while her hearing sharpened. From the other room she noticed the bark of her dog, Vincent. He wasn‚Äôt alarmed ‚Äî just casual, almost lazy. He was one of those rare dogs who found thunder comforting.

But before leaving to a reality where Amanda was free, he might have left her a message. But what did it mean?

Eventually she decoded it as a bored suggestion: ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ leave the kitchen already.‚Äù

Amanda smiled. And with that, fragments of memory returned.

The white room. The old woman who said something about ‚Äúreflection‚Äù and offered a cup of coffee. A man at a casino, insistent about camera‚Ä¶ somewhere. Oh, and the beautiful beach with two suns, unblinking ‚Äî where she had been herself, but not quite.

What was all that about? Some defense of the mind, echoes from other lives ‚Äî or some spiritual preparation?

Either way, she began to realise these memories ‚Äî or whatever they were ‚Äî weren‚Äôt random. Maybe there were forces on her side. Or just her subconscious, struggling to find a way out.

When all bizarre thoughts, theories and poses were finally spent, she raised her gaze.

And for a moment she saw straight through the walls, the rain, the storm ‚Äî through everything and nothing.

1mxguko,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeexchange/comments/1mxguko/cleanliness_standards_on_airbnb_vs_homeexchange/,Cleanliness standards on Airbnb vs HomeExchange,"Curious what reasonable expectations feel like as both a host and a guest on HomeExchange for cleanliness, and how that compares to Airbnb for what folks are used to? We just stayed at a house for the first time and were very off put by the level of the cleanliness, but the host was defensive of the situation outright saying that expectations were lesser on HomeExchange than Airbnb.  We want to be respectful of expectations but are also a little concerned for our own home that we are not letting folks stay in and how they will treat it.  If that means this community is not a fit for us then we want to learn now!  Here are the things we found unsettling/ not acceptable at the home we stayed in:

1. Sheets on the beds were not fresh when we arrived, and this had not been disclosed in advance. We have small children and got in late, so we all had to just sleep in the beds and then in the morning strip all beds and wash the sheets. The smell of someone elses body in the sheets was just a very unsettling way to start the trip, and our daughter in a bed with used sheets + \~50 stuffed toys that I'm assuming were also unwashed was a stressful start. 

2. All the towels smelled of mildew. We washed them twice in hot water with extra soap and things got 90% better.

3. All the linens in the house were just very worn. Towels with bleach stains, sheets where the bottom is super scratched up from years of someones toenails rubbing them.

4. When we arrived there was a bag of trash at the back door, and we realized days later that coffee grounds had been left in the coffee machine so it was all mouldy.

5. The house in general was just a little grimy, dusty in the corners, cluttered, you needed to kind of jimmy a metal bar to get out the back door which was otherwise bowed in.

What is a proper baseline? Does this feel standard for home exchange? Greatly appreciate all insights and perspectives!

1mxgtvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1mxgtvp/should_you_try_bluevua_ro100ropotlite/,Should you try Bluevua RO100ROPOT-LITE remineralization filter review for alkaline water benefits?,"Bluevua RO100ROPOT-LITE remineralization filters are something I‚Äôve been testing daily, and let me start by saying, they really came through in most ways. Designed as a year-long set compatible with the RO100ROPOT-LITE system, these filters aim to restore minerals to your drinking water and balance its pH. Having been in the market for a dependable remineralization filter for a while, I decided to give these a try, and here‚Äôs how they performed.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about these filters is their compact design. They measure just 3.9 by 2.36 inches, so they don't take up much space, which makes them easy to handle during installation. Their build features durable polypropylene combined with alkaline balls that work as the heart of the remineralization process. They‚Äôre lightweight at 6.7 ounces per filter but don‚Äôt feel flimsy or poorly made. I‚Äôve installed and replaced a fair number of water filters over the years, and this one is refreshingly straightforward.

**Ease of Installation and Use**  
Installing the remineralization filters was a breeze. They‚Äôre specifically designed for RO100ROPOT-LITE systems, which means no compatibility headaches. Within minutes, I had the filters running, and the water started flowing cleanly. No messy adjustments, no persistent leaking issues‚Äîjust a simple setup that made my life easier. Over the weeks, I‚Äôve checked on the setup periodically, and it stayed firmly in place without requiring constant readjustments‚Äîdefinitely a win.

**Advantages**  
- Provides a consistent year-round supply of mineralized, alkaline water.  
- Enriches water with important nutrients like calcium, magnesium, and potassium.  
- Effectively boosts the pH, which I noticed enhanced the taste of the water.  
- Long-lasting filters, with each providing six months of use.  
- Certified by WQA for safety and compliance, giving peace of mind about water quality.  

[Check Bluevua RO100ROPOT-LITE price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0cpf3xsry/)

**Impact on Water Taste and Quality**  
The flavor of my water noticeably improved after installing these filters. I‚Äôve always been a bit picky about the taste of drinking water, especially filtered water that can sometimes taste flat. These filters restored a natural freshness, and the slight alkalinity gave it a smoother finish. The improved pH balance (from 6.2 to roughly 7.5) even seemed to complement herbal teas and coffee better. I shared some test runs with my coworkers at the office, and they unanimously noticed a difference, especially compared to our older reverse osmosis filter without remineralization.

**Drawbacks**  
- Only compatible with RO100ROPOT-LITE systems, making them less versatile than some competitors.  
- Initial cost might feel slightly high, though it balances out over a year.  

**Performance and Longevity**  
Performance lived up to its promise with these two-pack filters. Each is rated for around six months, and so far, the first filter has been running strong. I appreciate how it maintains a steady flow rate, without slowing down as some subpar filters often do. While I can‚Äôt speak yet for the full capacity of a year, the consistent performance so far has been reassuring. The system also doesn‚Äôt need backflushing or constant maintenance, which is a notable plus for me.

**Competing Products**  
In the remineralization filter space, the Bluevua filters have stiff competition. Brands like APEC and AquaTru offer similar products, but I‚Äôve found that the Bluevua filter excels in its focus on alkaline remineralization without sacrificing ease of installation. For instance, compared to APEC‚Äôs Alkaline Filter Kit, which requires a separate housing component, the Bluevua option is plug-and-play. AquaTru‚Äôs filters, while high quality, haven‚Äôt been able to match the natural taste improvement I experienced with this one. That said, the AquaTru system offers UV filtration, which might appeal to those prioritizing sterilization over minerals.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Evaluating cost-effectiveness, I‚Äôd say these filters fall in the category of affordable quality. Some cheaper filters on the market might seem like a bargain at first glance, but they lack the durability and the rigorous safety certifications (like WQA and SGS) that these offer. The yearly pack means you don‚Äôt have to keep reordering, which is a bonus for someone like me who prefers a low-maintenance water filtration setup. All in all, this set delivers features that justify the price.

What is the largest snapping turtle that you have ever seen in the wild? 

Not something that you heard of or seen at a animal park. In the wild , in it's natural habitat. 


20 years ago I was walking my dog on a country road near my house and there was a pipe under the road that connects a stripper cut to a large natural spring. 


This turtle was almost as big as a coffee table , the pipe running under the road is probably 8-10 foot wide and this turtle was over half of it. 

It had it's head up and floating on the surface in a shallow area and barely touching with his back legs to move himself across the water. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 


I never told many people because the hill billies literally would have went to hunt it to eat. But lately I've been thinking a lot about it became friend just moved back to the area and I keep passing the spot. 

I'm gonna film the entire area with my drone and see if I leave some raw meat or fish out in the area I seen it before that maybe I can get a picture of it.

I've always heard people say that they see a turtle shell as big as a bath tub. This was definitely like that. It looked like a dinosaur and was so beautiful. I hope no one even knows it's there. Because it's actually a very remote location. 

Anyways I am going out to look for it soon. My friend's kids are excited. We just want to see that it's still alive. If I find it. I will definitely post some pictures. I know you guys will appreciate it.

1mxgrb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CastleTV/comments/1mxgrb5/47_seconds/,47 seconds,"Rewatching 47 seconds right now. It's a great episode - so emotional.

They're both finally ready to admit their feelings.  Rick is so afraid she won't be ready to hear it, but Martha convinces him to tell her anyway. They're so sweet and affectionate. 

They both decide to speak up, but they keep getting interrupted every time they get the nerve to speak up.

When Rick's at home reading files, Kate's missing him. She looks at his empty chair so intently, Ryan asks why. She says, ""Just thinking about my next move."" He transitions them back to the case.

Castle comes back with a coffee for Kate, but she's not there to receive it. And coffee is always symbolic of love in this show. But he leaves it for her.

He hears her tell the suspect that she remembers every second of getting shot and assumes she was intentionally rejecting him.

Meanwhile, she finds his coffee, immediately picks it up and asks about him. She wants him there, while he's off feeling hurt. When he goes back, it's sad. She's looking at him all smitten, and he's cold and distant and giving her dirty looks, and she has no idea why. 

The way these two actors can convey so much with just their eyes is impressive.

Then there's the question when they find out who the bomber is - why would he blow up what he cares so much about and become his own victim? The answer for the case was the bomber wanted attention, wanted others to care about what he was passionate about. The answer for Castle, as it unfolds over the next few episodes, is the same. He thinks Kate doesn't care about him, acts out, and their relationship pretty much blows up. 

At the end of the episode, after he comments on ""sinning by silence"" being ""cowardly,"" Kate invites him to go out for drinks and asks him what he wanted to talk about before. He says, ""nothing important"" and goes home. She wanted him to admit to his feelings but let him walk away. She could have told him to wait and fixed it all right then, but she didn't understand why he was blowing her off.

She tells Lanie in the next episode she's afraid he is over her, showing she still believed he would lose interest and dump her. She openly flirts through season 4, and this subplot increases the tension to make the resolution of the tension more satisfying.

When it first aired and we had to wait a week between episodes, it was so frustrating! So many fans were irritated by this plot movement, thinking it was an excuse to draw out the will-they-won't-they tension. But now watching it all together, it's written like literature, full of foreshadowing and symbolism. I love it.

¬† ""Good Lord,"" I muttered, turning the radio down. My lips curled at the smear of grease on the knob. I stared at my fingers, then wiped them off on the amulets still in my lap. They weren't good for anything else. The salt from the driver's too-frequent handlings had ruined them. Giving him a pained look, I dumped the charms into the chipped cup holder.  
  
¬† I turned to Ivy, sprawled in the back. One hand was up to keep her owl from falling out of the rear window as we bounced along, the other was propped behind her neck. Passing cars and the occasional functioning streetlight briefly illuminated her black silhouette. Dark and unblinking, her eyes met mine, then returned to the window and the night. My skin prickled at the air of ancient tragedy about her. She wasn't pulling an aura - she was just Ivy - but it gave me the willies. Didn't the woman ever smile?  
  
¬† My take had pressed herself into the other corner, as far from Ivy as she could get. The leprechaun's green boots just reached the end of the seat, and she looked like one of those dolls they sell on TV. Three easy payments of $49. 95 for this highly detailed rendition of Becky the Barmaid. Similar dolls have tripled, even quadrupled, in value! This doll, though, had a sneaky glint in her eye. I gave her a sly nod, and Ivy's gaze flicked suspiciously to mine.  
  
¬† The owl gave a pained hoot as we hit a nasty bump, opening its wings to keep its balance. But it was the last. We had crossed the river and were back in Ohio. The ride now was smooth as glass, and the cabbie's pace slowed as he seemed to remember what traffic signs were for.  
  
¬† Ivy removed her hand from her owl and ran her fingers through her long hair. ""I said, 'You never took me up on a ride before. ' What's up?""  
  
¬† ""Oh, yeah. "" I draped an arm over the seat. ""Do you know where I can rent a cheap flat? In the Hollows, maybe?""  
  
¬† Ivy faced me squarely, the perfect oval of her face looking pale in the streetlights. There were lights now at every corner, making it nearly bright as day. Paranoid norms. Not that I blamed them. ""You moving into the Hollows?"" she asked, her expression quizzical.  
  
¬† I couldn't help my smile at that. ""No. I'm quitting the I. S. ""  
  
¬† That got her attention. I could tell by the way she blinked. Jenks stopped trying to dance with the tiny figure on the dash and stared at me. ""You can't break your I. S. contract,"" Ivy said. She glanced at the leprechaun, who beamed at her. ""You're not thinking of. . . ""  
  
¬† ""Me? Break the law?"" I said lightly. ""I'm too good to have to break the law. I can't help it if she's the wrong leprechaun, though,"" I added, not feeling a bit guilty. The I. S. had made it abundantly clear they didn't want my services anymore. What was I supposed to do? Roll on my back with my belly in the air and lick someone's, er, muzzle?  
  
¬† ""Paperwork,"" the cabbie interjected, his accent abruptly as smooth as the road as he switched to the voice and manners needed to get and keep fares on this side of the river. ""Lose the paperwork. Happens all the time. I think I've Rynn Cormel's confession in here somewhere from when my father shuttled lawyers from quarantine to the courts during the Turn. ""  
  
¬† ""Yeah. "" I gave him a nod and smile. ""Wrong name on the wrong paper. Q. E. D. ""  
  
¬† Ivy's eyes were unblinking. ""Leon Bairn didn't just spontaneously explode, Rachel. ""  
  
¬† My breath puffed out. I wouldn't believe the stories. They were just that, stories to keep the I. S. 's flock of runners from wanting to break their contracts once they learned all the I. S. had to teach them. ""That was over ten years ago,"" I said. ""And the I. S. had nothing to do with it. They aren't going to kill me for breaking my contract; they want me to leave. "" I frowned. ""Besides, being turned inside out would be more fun than what I'm doing now. ""  
  
¬† Ivy leaned forward, and I refused to back away. ""They say it took three days to find enough of him to fit in a shoe box,"" she said. ""Scraped the last off the ceiling of his porch. ""  
  
¬† ""What am I supposed to do?"" I said, pulling my arm back. ""I haven't had a decent run in months. Look at this. "" I gestured to my take. ""A tax-evading leprechaun. It's an insult. ""  
  
¬† The little woman stiffened. ""Well, excu-u-u-u-use me. ""  
  
¬† Jenks abandoned his new girlfriend to sit on the back rim of the cabbie's hat. ""Yeah,"" he said. ""Rachel's gonna be pushing a broom if I have to take time off for workman's comp. ""  
  
¬† He fitfully moved his damaged wing, and I gave him a pained smile. ""Maitake?"" I said.  
  
¬† ""Quarter pound,"" he countered, and I mentally upped it to a half. He was okay, for a pixy.  
  
¬† Ivy frowned, fingering her crucifix chain. ""There's a reason no one breaks their contract. The last person to try was sucked through a turbine. ""  
  
¬† Jaw clenched, I turned to look out the front window. I remembered. It was almost a year ago. It would have killed him if he hadn't been dead already. The vamp was due back in the office any day now. ""I'm not asking for your permission,"" I said. ""I'm asking you if you know anyone with a cheap place to rent. "" Ivy was silent, and I shifted to see her. ""I have a little something tucked away. I can put up a shingle, help people that need it - ""  
  
¬† ""Oh, for the love of blood,"" Ivy interrupted. ""Leaving to open up a charm shop, maybe. But your own agency?"" She shook her head, her black hair swinging. ""I'm not your mother, but if you do this, you're dead. Jenks? Tell her she's dead. ""  
  
¬† Jenks nodded solemnly, and I flopped around to stare out the window. I felt stupid for having asked for her help. The cabbie was nodding. ""Dead,"" he said. ""Dead, dead, dead. ""  
  
¬† This was better and better. Between Jenks and the cab driver, the entire city would know I quit before I gave no-tice. ""Never mind. I don't want to talk about it anymore,"" I muttered.  
  
¬† Ivy draped an arm over the seat. ""Did it occur to you someone may be setting you up? Everyone knows leprechauns try to buy their way out. If you get caught, your butt is buttered. ""  
  
¬† ""Yeah,"" I said. ""I thought of that. "" I hadn't, but I wasn't going to tell her. ""My first wish will be to not get caught. ""  
  
¬† ""Always is,"" the leprechaun said slyly. ""That your first wish?"" In a flash of anger, I nodded, and the leprechaun grinned, dimples showing. She was halfway home.  
  
¬† ""Look,"" I said to Ivy. ""I don't need your help. Thanks for nothing. "" I shuffled in my bag for my wallet. ""Drop me here,"" I said to the cabbie. ""I want a coffee. Jenks? Ivy will get you back to the I. S. Can you do that for me, Ivy? For old times' sake?""  
  
¬† ""Rachel,"" she protested, ""you're not listening to me. ""  
  
¬† The  
cabbie carefully signaled, then pulled over. ""Watch your back, Hot Stuff. ""  
  
¬† I got out, yanked open the rear door, and grabbed my leprechaun by her uniform. My cuffs had completely masked her size spell. She was about the size of a chunky two-year-old. ""Here,"" I said, tossing a twenty onto the seat. ""That should cover my share. ""  
  
¬† ""It's still raining!"" the leprechaun wailed.  
  
¬† ""Shut up. "" Drops pattered against me, ruining my topknot and sticking the trailing strands to my neck. I slammed the door as Ivy leaned to say something. I had nothing left to lose. My life was a pile of magic manure, and I couldn't even make compost out of it.  
  
¬† ""But I'm getting wet,"" the leprechaun complained.  
  
¬† ""You want back in the car?"" I asked. My voice was calm, but inside I was seething. ""We can forget the whole thing if you want. I'm sure Ivy will take care of your paperwork. Two jobs in one night. She'll get a bonus. ""  
  
¬† ""No,"" came her meek, tiny voice.  
  
¬† Ticked, I looked across the street to the Starbucks catering to uptown snits who needed sixty different ways to brew a bean in order to not be happy with any of them. Being on this side of the river, the coffeehouse would likely be empty at this hour. It was the perfect place to sulk and regroup. I half dragged the leprechaun to the door, trying to guess the cost of a cup of coffee by the number of pre-Turn doodads in the front window.  
  
¬† ""Rachel, wait. "" Ivy had rolled down her window, and I could hear the cabbie's music cranked again. Sting's ""A Thousand Years. "" I could almost get back in the car.  
  
¬† I yanked the door of the cafe open, sneering at the chimes' merry jingle. ""Coffee. Black. And a booster seat,"" I shouted to the kid behind the counter as I strode to the darkest corner, my leprechaun in tow. Tear it all. The kid was a vision of upright character in his red-and-white-striped apron and perfect hair. Probably a university student. I could have gone to the university instead of the community college. At least for a semester or two. I'd been accepted and everything.  
  
¬† The booth, though, was cushy and soft. There was a real tablecloth. And my feet didn't stick to the floor, a definite plus. The kid was eyeing me with a superior look, so I pulled off my boots and sat cross-legged to harass him. I was still dressed like a hooker. I think he was trying to decide whether he should call the I. S. or its human counterpart, the FIB. That'd be a laugh.  
  
¬† My ticket out of the I. S. stood on the seat across from me and fidgeted. ""Can I have a latte?"" she whined.  
  
¬† ""No. ""  
  
¬† The door chimed, and I looked to see Ivy stride in with her owl on her arm, its talons pinching the thick armband she had. Jenks was perched on her shoulder, as far from the owl as he could get. I stiffened, turning to the picture above the table of babies dressed up as a fruit salad. I think it was supposed to be cute, but it only made me hungry.  
  
¬† ""Rachel. I have to talk to you. ""  
  
¬† This was apparently too much for Junior. ""Excuse me, ma'am,"" he said in his perfect voice. ""No pets allowed. The owl must remain outside. ""  
  
¬† Ma'am? I thought, trying to keep the hysterical laughter from bubbling up.  
  
¬† He went pale as Ivy glanced at him. Staggering, he almost fell as he sightlessly backed up. She was pulling an aura on him. Not good.  
  
¬† Ivy turned her gaze to me. My air whooshed out as I hit the back of the booth. Black, predator eyes nailed me to the vinyl seat. Raw hunger clutched at my stomach. My fingers convulsed.  
  
¬† Her bound tension was intoxicating. I couldn't look away. It was nothing like the gentle question the dead vamp had poised to me in The Blood and Brew. This was anger, domination. Thank God she wasn't angry with me, but at Junior behind the counter.  
  
¬† Sure enough, as soon as she saw the look on my face, the anger in her eyes flickered and went out. Her pupils contracted, setting her eyes back to their usual brown. In a clock-tick the shroud of power had slipped from her, easing back into the depths of hell that it came from. It had to be hell. Such raw domination couldn't come from an enchantment. My anger flowed back. If I was angry, I couldn't be afraid, right?  
  
¬† It had been years since Ivy pulled an aura on, me. The last time, we had been arguing over how to tag a low-blood vamp under suspicion of enticing underage girls with some asinine, role-playing card game. I had dropped her with a sleep charm, then painted the word ""idiot"" on her fingernails in red nail polish before tying her in a chair and waking her up. She had been the model friend since then, if a bit cool at times. I think she appreciated that I hadn't told anyone.  
  
¬† Junior cleared his throat. ""You - ah - can't stay unless you order something, ma'am?"" he offered weakly.  
  
¬† Gutsy, I thought. Must be an Inderlander.  
  
¬† ""Orange juice,"" Ivy said loudly, standing before me. ""No pulp. ""  
  
¬† Surprise made me look up. ""Orange juice?"" Then I frowned. ""Look,"" I said, unclenching my hands and roughly pulling my bag of charms onto my lap. ""I don't care if Leon Bairn did end up as a film on the sidewalk. I'm quitting. And nothing you say is going to change my mind. ""  
  
¬† Ivy shifted from foot to foot. It was her disquiet that cooled the last of my anger. Ivy was worried? I'd never seen that.  
  
¬† ""I want to go with you,"" she finally said.  
  
¬† For a moment, I could only stare. ""What?"" I finally managed.  
  
¬† She sat down across from me with an affected air of nonchalance, putting her owl to watch the leprechaun. The tearing sound as she undid the fasteners of her armband sounded loud, and she set it on the bench beside her. Jenks half hopped to the table, his eyes wide and his mouth shut for a change. Junior showed up with the booster chair and our drinks. We silently waited as he placed everything with shaking hands and went to hide in the back room.  
  
¬† My mug was chipped and only half full. I toyed with the idea of coming back to stick a charm under the table that would sour any cream that got within four feet of it, but decided I had more important things to contend with. Like why Ivy was going to flush her illustrious career down the proverbial toilet.  
  
¬† ""Why?"" I asked, floored. ""The boss loves you. You get to pick your assignments. You got a paid vacation last year. ""  
  
¬† Ivy was studying the picture, avoiding me. ""So?""  
  
¬† ""It was for four weeks! You went to Alaska for the midnight sun!""  
  
¬† Her thin black eyebrows bunched, and she reached to arrange her owl's feathers. ""Half the rent, half the utilities, half of everything is my responsibility, half is yours. I bring in and do my business, you bring in and handle yours. If need be, we work together. Like before. ""  
  
¬† I settled back, my huff not as obvious as I wanted it to be, since there was only the cushy upholstery to fall into. ""Why?"" I asked again.  
  
¬† Her fingers dropped from her owl. ""I'm very good at what I do,"" she said, not answering me. A hint of vulnerability had crept into her voice. ""I won't drag you down, Rachel. No vamp will dare move against me. I can extend that to you. I'll keep the vamp assassins off of you until you come up with the money to pay off your contract. With my connections and your spells, we can stay alive long enough to get the I. S. to drop the price on our heads. But I want a wish. ""  
  
¬† ""There's no price on our heads,"" I said quickly.  
  
¬† ""Rachel. . . "" she cajoled. Her brown eyes were soft in worry, alarming me. ""Rachel, there will be. "" She leaned forward until I fought not to retreat. I took a shallow breath to look for the smell of blood on her, smelling only the tang of juice. She was wrong. The I. S. wouldn't put a price on my head. They wanted me to leave. She was the one who should be worried.  
  
¬† ""Me, too,"" Jenks said suddenly. He vaulted to the rim of my mug. Iridescent dust sifted from his bent wing to make an oily film on my coffee. ""I want in. I want a wish. I'll ditch the I. S. and be both your backups. You're gonna need one. Rache, you get the four hours before midnight, Ivy the four after, or whatever schedule you want. I get every fourth day off, seven paid holidays, and a wish. You let me and my family live in the office, real quietlike in the walls. Pay me what I'm making now, biweekly. ""  
  
¬† Ivy nodded and took a sip of her juice. ""Sounds good to m  
e. What do you think?""  
  
¬† My jaw dropped. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. ""I can't give you my wishes. ""  
  
¬† The leprechaun bobbed her head. ""Yes, you can. ""  
  
¬† ""No,"" I said impatiently. ""I mean, I need them. "" A pang of worry had settled into my gut at the thought that maybe Ivy was right. ""I already used one to not get caught letting her go,"" I said. ""I have to wish to get out of my contract, for starters. ""  
  
¬† ""Uh,"" the leprechaun stammered. ""I can't do anything about that if it's in writing. ""  
  
¬† Jenks gave a snort of derision. ""Not that good, eh?""  
  
¬† ""Shut your mouth - bug!"" she snapped, color showing on her cheeks.  
  
¬† ""Shut your own, moss wipe!"" he snarled back.  
  
¬† This can't be happening, I thought. All I wanted was out, not to lead a revolt. ""You're not serious,"" I said. ""Ivy, tell me this is your twisted sense of humor finally showing itself. ""  
  
¬† She met my gaze squarely. I never could tell what was going on behind a vamp's eyes. ""For the first time in my career,"" she said, ""I'm going back empty-handed. I let my take go. "" She waved a hand in the air. ""Opened the trunk and let them run. I broke regulations. "" A closed-lipped smile flickered over her and was gone. ""Is that serious enough for you?""  
  
¬† ""Go find your own leprechaun,"" I said, catching myself as I reached for my cup. Jenks was still sitting on the handle.  
  
¬† She laughed. It was cold, and this time I did shiver. ""I pick my runs,"" she said. ""What do you think would happen if I went after a leprechaun, muffed it, then tried to leave the I. S. ?""  
  
¬† Across from me, the leprechaun sighed. ""No amount of wishing could make that look good,"" she piped up. ""It's going to be hard enough making this look like a coincidence. ""  
  
¬† ""And you, Jenks?"" I said, my voice cracking.  
  
¬† Jenks shrugged. ""I want a wish. It can give me something the I. S. can't. I want sterility so my wife won't leave me. "" He flew a ragged path to the leprechaun. ""Or is that too hard for you, greenie weenie?"" he mocked, standing with his feet spread wide and his hands on his hips.  
  
¬† ""Bug,"" she muttered, my charms jingling as she threatened to squish him. Jenks's wings went red in anger, and I wondered if the dust sifting from him could catch fire.  
  
¬† ""Sterility?"" I questioned, straggling to keep to the topic at hand.  
  
¬† He flipped the leprechaun off and strutted across the table to me. ""Yeah. You know how many brats I've got?""  
  
¬† Even Ivy looked surprised. ""You'd risk your life over that?"" she asked.  
  
¬† Jenks made a tinkling laugh. ""Who said I'm risking my life? The I. S. couldn't care less if I leave. Pixies don't sign contracts. They go through us too fast. I'm a free agent. I always have been. "" He grinned, looking far too sly for so small a person. ""I always will be. I figure my life span will be marginally longer with only you two lunkers to watch out for. ""  
  
¬† I turned to Ivy. ""I know you signed a contract. They love you. If anyone should be worried about a death threat, it's you, not me. Why would you risk that for - for - "" I hesitated. ""For nothing? What wish could be worth that?""  
  
¬† Ivy's face went still. A hint of black shadow drifted over her. ""I don't have to tell you. ""  
  
¬† ""I'm not stupid,"" I said, trying to hide my disquiet. ""How do I know you aren't going to start practicing again?""  
  
¬† Clearly insulted, Ivy stared at me until I dropped my gaze, chilled to the bone. This, I thought, is definitely not a good idea. ""I'm not a practicing vamp,"" she finally said. ""Not anymore. Not ever again. ""  
  
¬† I forced my hand down, realizing I was playing with my damp hair. Her words were only slightly reassuring. Her glass was half empty, and I only remembered her taking the one sip.  
  
¬† ""Partners?"" Ivy said, extending her hand across the table.  
  
¬† Partners with Ivy? With Jenks? Ivy was the best runner the I. S. had. It was more than a little flattering that she wanted to work with me on a permanent basis, if also a bit worrisome. But it wasn't as if I had to live with her. Slowly I stretched my hand to meet hers. My perfectly shaped red nails looked garish next to her unpolished ones. All my wishes - gone. But I would've probably wasted them anyway. ""Partners,"" I said, shivering at the coldness of Ivy's hand as I took it.  
  
¬† ""All right!"" Jenks crowed, flitting to land on top of our handshake. The dust sifting from him seemed to warm Ivy's touch. ""Partners!

Dear God,"" I moaned under my breath. ""Don't let me be sick. Not here. "" I shut my eyes in a long blink, hoping the light wouldn't hurt so much when I opened them. I was in my cubicle, twenty-fifth floor of the I. S. tower. The afternoon sun slanted in, but it would never reach me, my desk being toward the middle of the maze. Someone had brought in doughnuts, and the smell of the frosting made my stomach roil. All I wanted was to go back home and sleep.  
  
¬† Tugging open my top drawer, I fumbled for a pain amulet, groaning when I found I'd used them all. My forehead hit the edge of the metal desk, and I stared past my frizzy length of hair to my ankle boots peeping past the hem of my jeans. I had worn something conservative in deference to my quitting: a tuck-in red linen shirt and pants. No more tight leather for a while.  
  
¬† Last night had been a mistake. It had taken far too many drinks for me to get stupid enough to officially give my remaining wishes to Ivy and Jenks. I had really been counting on the last two. Anyone who knows anything about wishes knows you can't wish for more. The same goes for wishing for wealth. Money doesn't just appear. It has to come from somewhere, and unless you wish not to get caught, they always get you for theft.  
  
¬† Wishes are tricky things, which was why most Inderlanders had lobbied to get a minimum of three-per-go. In hindsight, I hadn't done too badly. Having wished to not get caught letting the leprechaun go would at least allow me to leave the I. S. with a clear record. If Ivy was right and they were going to nack me for breaking my contract, they would have to make it look like an accident. But why would they bother? Death threats were expensive, and they wanted me gone.  
  
¬† Ivy had gotten a marker to call her wish in later. It looked like an old coin with a hole in it, and she had laced it on a purple cord and hung it about her neck. Jenks, though, spent his wish right in the bar, buzzing off to give the news to his wife. I should have left when Jenks had, but Ivy didn't seem to want to leave. It had been a long time since I'd had a girls' night out, and I thought I might find the courage at the bottom of a glass to tell the boss I was leaving. I hadn't.  
  
¬† Five seconds into my rehearsed speech, Denon flipped open an manila envelope, pulled out my contract, and tore it up, telling me to be out of the building in half an hour. My badge and I. S. -issue cuffs were in his desk; the charms that had decorated them were in my pocket.  
  
¬† My seven years with the I. S. had left me with an accumulated clutter of knickknacks and outdated memos. Fingers trembling, I reached for a cheap, thick-walled vase that hadn't seen a flower for months. It went into the trash, just like the cretin who had given it to me. My dissolution bowl went into the box at my feet. The salt-encrusted blue ceramic grated harshly on the cardboard. It had gone dry last week, and the rime of salt left from evaporation was dusty.  
  
¬† A wooden dowel of redwood clattered in next to it. It was too thick to make a wand out of, but I wasn't good enough to make a wand anyway. I had bought the dowel to make a set of lie-detecting amulets and never got around to it. It was easier to buy them. Stretching, I grabbed my phone list of past contacts. A quick look to be sure no one was watching, and I shoved it out of sight next to my dissolution bowl, sliding my disc player and headphones to cover it.  
  
¬† I had a few reference books to go back to Joyce across the aisle, but the container of salt propping them up had been my dad's. I set it in the box, wondering what Dad would think of me leaving. ""He would be pleased as punch,"" I whispered, gritting my teeth against my hangover.  
  
¬† I glanced up, sending my gaze over the ugly yellow partitions. My eyes narrowed as my coworkers looked the other way. They were standing in huddled groups as they gossiped, pretending to be busy. Their hushed whispers grated on me. Taking a slow breath, I reached for my black-and-white picture of Watson, Crick, and the woman behind it all, Rosalind Franklin. They were standing before their model of DNA, and Rosalind's smile had the same hidden humor of Mona Lisa. One might think she knew what was going to happen. I wondered if she had been an Inderlander. Lots of people did. I kept the picture to remind myself how the world turns on details others miss.**Enjoyed it? Upvote and comment! Want the full story?

1mxgnuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mxgnuz/millers_diner_staple_to_stronghold/,Miller's Diner: Staple to Stronghold,"*‚ÄúSome places, they hold on longer than they ought to. Miller‚Äôs has been serving coffee and meatloaf since Eisenhower was in the White House... fifty years of grease in the walls and pie crust that could outlast a cockroach.*

*And yet‚Ä¶ not all traditions survive the end of the world. The bell above that door don‚Äôt just announce customers anymore. Sometimes it tolls like a funeral chime.*

*Tonight, a drifter in a sand-worn duster comes looking for respite, a hot plate, and maybe a quiet corner. He‚Äôll get more than he ordered. Listen close, survivor. This is how Miller‚Äôs Diner fell from staple to stronghold.‚Äù*

 Boot leather groaned as Gil pushed through Miller‚Äôs front door, his shoulders slumped with the weight of another day on foot. The bell overhead gave a hollow jingle, worn down from decades of use, but the smell inside almost made him forget the road. Black coffee, grease fried deep into the counters, and the faint sweetness of pie cooling in the back.

He slid into a booth, dropped his hat onto the vinyl beside him, and ordered the plate everyone came for: meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and a slab of pie to follow. Miller‚Äôs hadn‚Äôt changed in half a century. Sweet tea still poured cold, the jukebox still blinked when the power felt generous, and for a heartbeat Gil could almost believe the world outside wasn‚Äôt ash and hunger.

The fork was halfway to his mouth when the front door slammed open so hard it cracked against the wall. A man staggered in. Eddie, one of the town regulars, pale as paper and mumbling broken syllables that didn‚Äôt add up to words.

A hostess rushed from behind the counter to steady him, but Eddie‚Äôs knees buckled. He hit the tile in a fit of convulsions, jerking, frothing. The room froze, forks hovering, eyes wide. Then‚Ä¶ silence.

The hostess bent low, trembling fingers at his neck. For a heartbeat, relief softened her face. And then Eddie‚Äôs jaw snapped open, his teeth clamped down on her wrist with a sound that made the whole diner shriek. Blood sprayed the checkerboard floor.

Gil was already moving. Chair overturned, hand to the machete at his hip, he tore across the floor. The struggle was short, violent, ugly. A swing, a shove, and Eddie went still... no longer twitching, no longer breathing, no longer anything but a corpse in the middle of Miller‚Äôs.

The diner held its breath, silence broken only by the hiss of the coffeepot on the burner. Then came the moans. Low, guttural. Shadows pressed against the glass. Pale hands scraped the windows. The bell above the door jingled again. Not from welcome, but from weight against the frame.

Gil‚Äôs eyes swept the room. Barricade the doors? Rally these folks to fight? Or make a break for it before the glass gave way?

Outside, the dead gathered, hungry and patient...

 ***‚ÄúTables! Get ‚Äôem up, now!‚Äù*** Gil barked, voice sharp as the machete in his hand.

The patrons didn‚Äôt need convincing. A pair of truckers flipped a booth on its side and shoved it against the front doors. The cook vaulted the counter, apron swinging, and rammed a metal table leg through the handles. The hostess, pale and shaking from the blood still dripping off her arm, tore down the blinds and jammed them under the frame of the corner window.

Together, they moved fast, panic making them strong. Gil threw his shoulder against the wobbling doorframe, forcing it shut as another set of hands slapped at the glass from outside. The neon sign beyond flickered, then went dark. The main lobby was sealed‚Ä¶ **for now.**

That was when they heard it.

***""Crack!""***

Every head turned toward the back hall. A sound like dry timber splitting, followed by the groan of metal hinges giving up.

The emergency exit.

The rear door burst inward, the frame splintered from the pressure. Figures poured through. Two, three of them, stumbling and snapping their teeth. The stench of rot rolled in like a wave.

Gil was moving before thought caught up, boots pounding the linoleum. ***‚ÄúWith me!‚Äù*** he shouted, dragging a desk from the corner as he ran. Wood screeched across tile, heavy and stubborn, but he forced it toward the ruined exit.

One of the shamblers lunged, arms wide, teeth gnashing. Gil‚Äôs machete came down with a wet crack, splitting skull, momentum carrying him forward toward the door. Blood sprayed hot across the wall tiles.

Behind him, chaos bloomed. The cook swung his cleaver with a roar, the blade biting into the shoulder of a second corpse. A waitress, eyes wild, drove a broken chair leg into its ribs with a cry more of terror than courage. The thing staggered but kept thrashing, clawing, hungry still.

***‚ÄúPush it back! Push it back!‚Äù*** Gil shouted, jamming the desk against the ruined doorway. The wood wedged into place, buying seconds, maybe minutes, of breathing room. His muscles shook with the strain.

The patrons fought, grunted, bled. One went down screaming, teeth sinking into his forearm before the cleaver split the corpse apart.

And then‚Ä¶ silence *for a heartbeat.*

Gil‚Äôs chest heaved as he pressed the desk hard against the splintered frame, knuckles white, sweat stinging his eyes. The rear hall was choked with bodies, both moving and still. The barricade held, but barely.

***‚ÄúWon‚Äôt last long,‚Äù*** the cook muttered, wiping gore from his apron.

Gil‚Äôs gaze swept the shaken faces in the dim diner light. They could hold out, pray for help that would never come‚Ä¶ or break for the road, with the horde pressing closer by the second.

Another crack split the silence. The windows groaned, glass bending inward.

The jukebox flickered alive, sputtering static before belching out a tinny tune; Elvis Presley - ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Be Cruel.‚Äù The music echoed across the blood-slick floor, warbling, surreal.

And outside, more hands pressed against the glass... 

- *Til the next tick...*

The 2025 Guide for Bahrain Company Formation and Regional Mobility\
\
Alt text: Business professionals in a modern corporate environment in Bahrain.), Bahrain GDP is expected to grow 4.9% in 2025, outpacing several Gulf neighbors. Forbes Business just ranked Bahrain among the top three Middle East destinations for foreign SME launch, citing a 22% year-on-year spike in CR (Commercial Registration) applications, especially in the Seef District tech corridor.\
\
Zero Income Tax: A big draw for regional founders and remote teams.\
Flexible Ownership Laws: 99% foreign ownership in most sectors (detailed breakdown).\
Cost Efficiency: Bahrain company formation fees are among the lowest in the region (compare costs).\
Fast e-Government: Sijilat and LMRA digital portals save weeks, not days.\
\
\
Importantly, the government‚Äôs 2025 ‚ÄúOpen Business Door‚Äù initiative (launched March 2025 by EDB) now prioritizes digital banking and fintech startups, granting same-week provisional CRs for qualifying ventures (source).\
\
Despite all these advantages, one question remains persistent for regional founders: how much freedom of movement does the Bahrain investor visa really offer within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)?\
\
The Investor Visa Reality: Can You Travel Freely Across the GCC?\
Understanding the Basics: What the Bahrain Investor Visa Actually Grants\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration: Founders discussing regional mobility. lets foreign shareholders live and run their business in Bahrain. But ‚Äî and this is a crucial distinction ‚Äî it does not confer automatic travel or residency rights in other GCC countries.\
Here's how it breaks down:\
\
Bahrain Only: Your investor visa is valid exclusively for entry, exit, and residency in Bahrain.\
Business Travel to Other GCC States: Requires separate visas for UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, and Kuwait.\
No Schengen-Style Internal Freedom: There is no shared GCC investor visa or ‚Äúbusiness mobility pass‚Äù (as is common in the EU).\
\
\
(Personal aside: I learned this the hard way in 2019 when ‚Äî despite being a 100% owner of a Bahrain Free Zone entity ‚Äî I faced a last-minute scramble for a Saudi business visa before a crucial meeting in Khobar. That experience made me over-prepare my visa paperwork for every GCC trip since.)\
\
Important 2025 Regulatory Updates\
In March 2025, new GCC passporting talks were rumored (Gulf News), but as of June, no unified visa regime is in force. However, Bahrain's EDB confirmed a new e-visa fast-track arrangement for business travelers to UAE and Saudi, cutting average processing time to 2 working days if certain CR ownership thresholds are met.\
Always check for sector-specific exemptions; fintech and logistics get priority under the 2025 scheme.\
\
What About ‚ÄúFree Zones‚Äù and Regional Benefits?\
\
Alt text: Business meeting and collaboration in free zones.) will grant GCC-wide mobility. This is a myth.\
Free zones offer:\
\
0% tax on profits for specified durations\
100% repatriation of capital and profits\
Fast-track work visas and customs clearance\
\
But free zone licenses are site-specific. They do not bestow regional travel privileges ‚Äî your investor visa is still Bahrain-only.\
\
Step-by-Step: How to Form a Bahrain Company and Secure Your Investor Visa\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: Organizing visa and incorporation paperwork.):\
\
WLL (With Limited Liability): Most common, minimum 1 shareholder, full foreign ownership in most sectors.\
SPC (Single Person Company): Simplest for solo founders.\
BSC(C) (Closed Joint Stock): Ideal for fundraising or multiple shareholders.\
\
Insider tip: For most startups or consultancies, a WLL based in Seef or Diplomatic Area keeps costs reasonable, with strong access to government services.\
2. Secure a Business Address ‚Äî Why Location Matters\
Choosing a premium office in Bahrain Bay or the Financial Harbour saves time on government paperwork due to faster Sijilat processing and higher perceived legitimacy.\
Budget: BHD 650/year for flexi-desks, BHD 2200+ for private offices.\
\
I once waited three weeks longer for LMRA processing because my lease was in a less-known area. Now, I always advise new founders: pay for a recognized address in your first year, then reconsider once you‚Äôve built official relationships.\
\
3. Prepare All Documents ‚Äî and Anticipate What‚Äôs Really Needed\
\
CR application (via Sijilat portal)\
MOA (Memorandum of Association)\
Passport copy, photo, proof of address\
Bank statement (show BHD 5,000+ to ease scrutiny)\
Lease agreement stamped by EWA\
\
Pro tip: Complete your Sijilat and LMRA uploads before 9am on weekdays ‚Äî MOICT officers process ‚Äúfirst in, first out‚Äù and Friday submissions are always delayed.\
4. Apply for the Investor Visa\
\
Submit via LMRA portal or Tamkeen desk\
Pay fees (BHD 172 for 2 years, 2025 pricing)\
Undergo medical test at Salmaniya Hospital (a quick note: go before 10am to avoid queues, and ask for the business visa window)\
Collect visa from LMRA HQ in Diplomatic Area\
\
5. Quick-Start Tips to Save Time and Money\
\
Use a reputable agent who has in-person relationships at Sijilat and LMRA.\
Scan every document in advance and label in both English and Arabic.\
Double-check names and dates ‚Äî typos can halt your application for weeks.\
Choose Ramadan afternoons for submissions ‚Äî many founders avoid this, leading to shorter queues.\
\
6. Budgeting: What It Really Costs in BHD (2025)\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs: Calculating incorporation and visa expenses.\
- MOA Drafting and Notarization: BHD 85‚Äì140\
- Lease (flexi-desk to office): BHD 650‚Äì3500/year\
- Investor Visa (2 yrs): BHD 172 (plus medical & admin)\
- Agent/Service Fees: BHD 350‚Äì700\
Total realistic budget: BHD 1,650 to BHD 4,500 for most new companies.\
Get a line-item breakdown or use a calculator.\
Surprisingly, I‚Äôve seen founders stuck with 40-60% higher bills due to hidden legal translation or rush fees. Always ask for a total upfront quote.\
\
Compliance and Post-Formation: Avoiding the Classic Mistakes\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation: Ensuring regulatory paperwork is in order. founder mistake: Failing to renew the Sijilat CR and investor visa on time.\
This leads to:\
\
Automatic CR suspension\
Fines up to BHD 500\
Visa cancellation and blacklisting risk\
\
Tactics to avoid this:\
\
Use an automated calendar or external compliance provider\
Schedule CR and visa renewal reminders for 10 months after issuance (not 12)\
Build rapport with an MOICT staffer ‚Äî networking during majlis-style meetings with Arabic coffee goes a long way\
\
And ‚Äî this is where true business culture comes in ‚Äî always attend major meetings in Seef or Diplomatic Area during the correct ‚Äúsummer‚Äù or ‚ÄúRamadan‚Äù hours. Being early is seen as respectful. Offering coffee (and accepting at least a sip) is considered important etiquette.\
\
Networking, Support, and Resources: Where to Get Reliable Help\
\
Alt text: Professional business support: Consulting with company formation experts in Bahrain.), some regulated sectors (like media, telecom, or military contractors) still require a local sponsor or ‚Äúservice agent.‚Äù\
Check before you launch, especially if you are entering sensitive industries.\
Picking the Right Service Provider\
From direct experience, I highly recommend KeyLink Bahrain:\
They fast-track CR paperwork, minimize in-person visits, and, most importantly, keep you updated on regulatory changes (like the 2025 online MOA stamp). They saved me 8 hours of back-and-forth at MOICT when I was caught by a last-minute documentation change.\
Comparison: Bahrain vs. UAE/Saudi Arabia Mobility\
\
UAE: Similar process, but higher costs (company formation averages AED 22,000+), slightly simpler for multi-country business due to more frequent business visitor visa approvals.\
Saudi Arabia: More complex for 100% foreign-owned entities and slower document processing, but larger domestic market.\
\
Bahrain‚Äôs edge: Faster e-government systems, easier foreign ownership, more transparent cost structure.\
\
2025 Policy Change: E-Visa Fast-Tracking for Business Owners\
As of April 2025, Bahrain introduced a business express e-visa for CR holders and investor visa recipients. You can now apply for short-term UAE and Saudi Arabia business travel online, with approval in as little as 24‚Äì48 hours, provided your Bahrain CR reflects actual trading activity (not just a holding company).\
My personal workaround for last-minute travel:\
Always keep a digital folder with:\
\
Visa copy (PDF)\
Latest CR printout\
Bank statement showing recent transactions\
Invitation letter from your host company\
This ‚Äúready pack‚Äù speeds up GCC visa applications drastically.\
\
\
A Tangent on Bahrain‚Äôs Ramadan Business Culture ‚Äî and Its Impact\
During Ramadan, government hours in Diplomatic Area and Seef are reduced (often 9am‚Äì1pm). Many founders wrongly assume business ‚Äúshuts down.‚Äù Actually, the opposite holds for networking: after sundown, majlises and coffee meetings bloom.\
\
I once clinched my largest supply contract in a post-Iftar majlis in Bahrain Bay ‚Äî only because I stayed for the midnight gahwa round.\
These relationships can help smooth surprise regulatory snags (even for visa issues) down the line.\
\
\
Practical FAQ ‚Äì Investor Visas, Mobility, and Bahrain Company Formation\
1. Can my Bahrain investor visa be upgraded to GCC-wide access in future?\
\
Currently, no. Each GCC state has its own visa system. However, Bahrain‚Äôs 2025 ‚Äúbusiness e-visa‚Äù arrangement (see EDB update) makes it much easier to fast-track regional travel for active CR owners.\
\
2. How long does the entire company formation and visa process take?\
\
With correct documentation, you can complete everything in 10‚Äì15 business days. Delays occur if MOA or lease documents require resubmission. Work with a trusted provider to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth. Submit all forms early in the day.\
\
3. What is the minimum investment required for a Bahrain investor visa?\
\
Officially, there is no set minimum, but BHD 5,000+ in company capital is expected for smoother approval. Higher amounts may be needed in regulated sectors.\
Get an estimate before applying.\
\
4. Can I own 100% of my Bahrain company as a foreigner?\
\
In most sectors, yes (see foreign ownership rules). For certain industries, a local sponsor is still required.\
\
5. What compliance steps must I follow after my visa is granted?\
\
Keep your Sijilat CR, LMRA records, and tax files up to date. Many founders use external accounting services to stay ahead. Late renewals lead to heavy fines.\
\
\
If you‚Äôre planning to launch or expand in Bahrain, get professional guidance, keep your paperwork digital and current, and remember: regional mobility starts with good compliance at home. More resources, updated process guides, and a detailed cost checklist are available via KeyLinkBH company formation portal.\

Particularly now that i feel it is ‚Äútime to grow up‚Äù as I‚Äôve just graduated from university, and leave ‚Äúchildish‚Äù things like my perverse mental illness, obsessive tendencies, and impulsive behaviours in the past. 

I feel stunted, not ‚Äúgrown up‚Äù or less equipped to take on the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world. Job and paid internship applications feels nauseating, my job prospects look like crap and im ashamed to admit that i am truly afraid of the prospect of living a working class life and working in service for the rest of my life‚Äîim also staying at home with my abusive family feels unbearable, and I know it‚Äôs probably not just me, because my little sister recently attempted suicide and is back from the psych ward as of yesterday. 

I‚Äôve been becoming insanely chronically online with 12 hour screen time and pathological shitposting and over sharing on my spam account, and like I am regressing into my teenage ‚Äúfemcel‚Äù self after 4 years away at a ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù university, during which I was finally was able to come into my own and find community, even with extremely successful and high performing peers‚Äîalso due to losing a substantive amount of weight before college. I thought going to college and losing some weight had made me normal, fixed me. I had my first group of friends, first boyfriend, community, etcetera. 

It‚Äôs the anniversary of the end of my first and also domestically abusive relationship, and I find myself getting caught up in endless maladaptive daydreams and intense analysis about a casual but longwithstanding internet friendship from my teen years, with someone who has a partner, and doesn‚Äôt feel the same‚Äîand this all started after I had an embarrassing and slightly exposing interaction with them. After the fact, I found myself spiralling out and dissecting every thought and emotion about the ethics of said thought and said desire for connection and the very delusion of it being connection with someone I cannot ever truly know,  across 3AI chatbot platforms. And feeling, in turn, like this idealising behaviour I have towards others is completely bizarre. I even had a mild fantasy about trying to get a job in their country, which I feel totally disgusted and weirded out about since I know this is just the projection of a sick mind. 

I was feeling heady, light on my feet, out of touch with reality to the point where it was impairing my ability to pay attention and impairing my motor function/clumsiness, so I was breaking A LOT of things the last couple of weeks, before I recently realised, because of my reaction to this internet thing, that ive probably been experiencing an acute level of distress I‚Äôve been more or less in denial about. In response, I purposely self sabotaged to make my self feel even worse. I‚Äôve partially engineered my own anxiety through an insane regime of lots of marijuana, lots of black coffee, alternate day fasting to lose more weight, making me at once a jittery, paranoid, anxious mess, physically exhausting me, numbing me out and crippling me from doing all of the adult tasks I am terrified of, for what they may amount in: either abject failure, or the loss of my freedom.  

The core of my loneliness is because I don‚Äôt know how I can express this to any of my loved ones without either facilitating their dismissal or enabling, of enabling me through being dismissive of what I fear may be a severe existential crisis, and the deep loneliness of not being able to share it because I know the potential denial, and misunderstanding, or worse of all, rejection and repulsion towards me, that will ensue if I am ever truly honest with others.

I fear none of my loved ones and real life (or even internet) friends can fathom depth of my self hatred, body and weight obsession, recurrent delusions of grandeur and ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù through being successful (x will regret y, because I‚Äôve ____!‚Äù or say lost more weight, made more money) ,fear, insecurity, neediness, fear of failure, emptiness, and pathological boredom. 

I am afraid of going to a therapist, because they will either affirm these thoughts with a potentially stifling, terrifying and life changing diagnosis, OR face the possible reality that im just a pathetic ‚Äúnormal‚Äù freak, and there is no grandiose explanation for how I‚Äôve felt for my entire life, except that I just need to suck it up and have ‚Äúless‚Äù self empathy, and just ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù and ‚Äúget over it.‚Äù I‚Äôm horrified and embarrassed to articulate this to anyone I know, and sometimes I desire mentally ill and deluded community with people who have faced substantive internal or external suffering, who will make me feel normal‚Äîjust as much as I want to be valorised by association with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people, like my internet and real life college friends. 


I feel I am socially ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to some degree, by my free spirited peers, to be ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù right now because im young-ish‚Äîand because i can commentate on ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù shenanigans or desires I have with some level of precision and self awareness, I feel like there is an assumption i am more well than I actually am, im bored, its for attention, im lying, im just being quirky and having fun, being silly. I simultaneously revel in this imagined interpretation of others, because I feel like the truth of how unwell and crazy I actually can be at times is largely shielded from others and I‚Äôve been successful at masking it, but it‚Äôs also demoralising and lonely because I fear no one has any idea or would want to be around me if they knew how my brain really worked, or knew about some of the impulsive tendencies I have, that all of my relationships and connections are based on this unspoken contingency of keeping up this facade. Also, it is more comforting for my peers and family to delegate me to ‚Äúa little emotional but functional and overall in control‚Äù To keep me (rightfully) responsible for myself and my actions, that I myself often feel dominated by‚Äîand im so suspicious of myself, that I am not sure how much of it I can and can‚Äôt control, and I sometimes fear that I am a liar or an exaggerator and that these feelings and thoughts I have, that I am suspicious are very abnormal, are actually very normal and im over interpreting it to exonerate me from responsibility from my desire to be destructive and impulsive whenever I get too bored or feel like my ego is at stake.

I have the ability to watch the disaster happen and know exactly what caused it and why, but feel totally powerless to do anything but observe myself and observe my patterns despite my dislike of it. But what if, being that I have literally no reason to assume otherwise based off the current data, that I still feel crazy when im old? What will happen then? There is nothing of merit to the ramblings of a mad person, especially if its a mad woman. To be deeply neurotic into your old age, growing more neurotic by the year, it is a pathetic and accursed existence I‚Äôve watched other women in my family take. It‚Äôs not cute: it‚Äôs ugly, and repulsive, sad.

Now, in desperation, I guess im asking Reddit for its thoughts; something inbetween the humanity of my friends, to whom I feel I cannot accurately express this to because of their biases and preconceptions about me, and the anonymity of taking to an AI, without the sycophancy.

1mxgkuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HoustonFood/comments/1mxgkuy/a_summer_intern_reviews_houston_restaurants/,A Summer Intern Reviews Houston Restaurants,"Hi everyone! This summer I interned at a downtown Houston company. I went out to lunch with fellow interns and coworkers a lot, so I thought I'd review the restaurants I tried this summer! I'm not a professional by any means; my thoughts are just my personal opinions. If I had a bad experience somewhere, it might have just been an off day - these are just my experiences, not the ultimate facts!

**Kopi Cowboy - Coffee**  
Honestly, I have no idea how more people don't talk about this place. They have a table on 1100 Main (in the tunnels) from Tuesday to Thursday, and the coffee is just incredible. The owner and his sister are so kind, and they truly care about their customers. I've never had anything like their signature butter latte and can't sing their praises enough.

**Folk Thai**  
Got the Pad Thai ($20) but wasn't impressed - needed more flavor, the noodles were tough, and it felt overpriced for the quality. It's a popular spot with my coworkers, though, so might just not be my thing.

**Deli Deluxe - Indian/American**  
Absolutely incredible Indian coffee and tea. The owner, Manish, is *so* kind and will spend time with you to explain each dish and figure out what's best for your taste. Can't recommend it enough.

**Kati Roll Wala - Indian**  
Got the Aloo Masala Bowl here and was disappointed. The food was very underseasoned, and the portion size was quite small.

**Chubby's Dips - Desserts**  
If you ever are craving a sweet treat throughout the day, this is definitely the place to go. Their mousse and flan are delicious, and the workers are always so sweet and helpful. My friend is allergic to dairy, and they didn't have anything on hand that was dairy free, so they made dairy free desserts just for her the next day.

**Bullritos - Tex Mex**  
In my opinion, Bullritos is basically Chipotle, but cheaper. Good for a quick meal.

**Zero's Sandwiches**  
I always get the Reuben here, and it's absolutely delicious. The bread is made in house and it's soft and fresh every day. Very reasonably priced menu items all across the board!

**Luchi & Joeys - Mexican**  
Genuinely some of the best tacos I've had. So fresh and authentic, and the hot sauce was *actually* spicy! I tried nopales here for the first time, and WHAT have I been missing out on all these years?! Their breakfast tacos are an absolute must.

**Sultan Pepper - Mediterranean**  
I've come to the conclusion that Mediterranean food is the best food to eat on a lunch break. Filling, but not so heavy that you're falling asleep at your desk after lunch lol. The food is so reasonably priced and delicious; I was thinking about that chicken shawarma for the rest of the day. Shockingly good pasta here as well!

**Abu Omar - Mediterranean**  
The lunch special here is an absolute must. 7 dollars for a huge plate of rice stacked with meat and fresh veggies. I went to this place so much on my lunch breaks; those workers knew me by name. You won't find a better deal in all of downtown than that lunch special.

**Boomtown Coffee**  
This is a coffee spot in the Understory. Sad to say, I was not impressed at all. Got a chai, and it tasted like pho broth. Service was excellent, though; all the workers were very kind and conversational.

**Dough Zone - Chinese**  
Now this one isn't downtown; it's in uptown. One lucky day, one of my fellow interns drove in to the office, so we were able to make the short drive to Dough Zone. I have dreams about their soup dumplings at times, and their dan dan noodles are delicious as well.

**Mayuri - Indian**  
The dosa here tastes just like the ones my grandma used to make. Incredibly authentic, and I cannot recommend the chicken biriyani enough.

**Mendocino Farms - Sandwiches + Salads**  
I got the sweet peach and goat cheese here, and it was 18 dollars for quite a small bowl of salad. The salad was bland and flavorless and (imo) ridiculously overpriced.

**The Rustic**  
Such good quesadillas and tacos. I would skip the empanadas and cornbread, but overall quite good food. The vibe is so energetic and alive. Would definitely come here with friends.

**Gulf & Prairie - New American**  
The rice bowls here are delicious! It's a nice restaurant in the Hyatt you can come to for more serious meetings with coworkers and still have a nice meal. Workers are really friendly and genuinely care about their restaurant, which is so cool to see!

**Mona - Italian**  
Kind of like Chipotle but with pasta. A really cool concept, and it's very fun to see the pasta being cooked right in front of you.

**API Kitchen Southern Food**  
Impeccable banana pudding - tastes like the southern grandma at church made it. Food is seasoned to perfection.

**China Ocean**  
Got the Kung Pao Chicken, and it didn't have much flavor. They made up for it with their potatoes; they were seasoned to perfection, and I couldn't get enough of them.

P.S.  
I've tried a lot of restaurants in Houston, but I limited this list to ones in *downtown* downtown Houston, hoping that it might be helpful for future interns or corporate workers! Please keep in mind that I'm still a college student so my definition of expensive is definitely a lot different when compared to people with actual jobs lol.",9,1755892362.0,HoustonFood,1,1.0,False

¬† The starter gun shatters the silence, releasing the runners from their blocks.  
  
¬† Track season starts in a couple weeks, but no one has told Coach Lindt about winter. He‚Äôs convinced that the only way to get us into shape is to practice‚Äîeven when my breath freezes right in front of me.  
  
¬† This is Opportunity, Alabama. Sane people don‚Äôt leave their homes when it‚Äôs white and frosty outside. We stock up on canned food, drink hot chocolate until we succumb to sugar comas, and pray to be saved from the cold.  
  
¬† Still, Coach Lindt‚Äôs start-of-season training beats Principal Trenton‚Äôs long and arduous start-of-semester speech‚Äîvirtue, hard work, and the proper behavior of young ladies and gentlemen. After almost four years at Opportunity High, I can recite her words from memory, which is exactly what I did for Matt at breakfast this morning‚Äîresponsibility, opportunity (‚Äúno pun intended‚Äù), and her favorite, our school motto: We Shape the Future.  
  
¬† It sounds glorious, but with months left until graduation, I have no clue what the future looks like. If Opportunity shaped me, I didn‚Äôt notice. Running, I know. This track, I know. One step after another after another. It doesn‚Äôt matter what comes next as long as I keep moving forward.  
  
¬† My foot slips, and I stumble.  
  
¬† From his position on the field, Coach curses. ‚ÄúClaire, attention! One misstep‚Äôs the difference between success and failure.‚Äù  
  
¬† Straightening, I refocus.  
  
¬† A familiar laugh colors the still morning. ‚ÄúDid you freeze up over holiday break, Sarge? A snail could catch up with you floundering like that.‚Äù On the straightaway of the track, Chris falls into step with me.  
  
¬† I suck in a breath before I answer him. ‚ÄúOh, shut up.‚Äù  
  
¬† My best friend only laughs louder. The even rhythm of his footsteps and his breathing challenge me to find my pace. His presence steadies me like it always does. At six-foot-five and with sun-touched hair and blue eyes, Chris is not just our best runner but also Opportunity‚Äôs poster-boy athlete. On uniform days, the freshman girls fawn over him.  
  
¬† With Chris by my side, my stride shortens. The other two runners on our varsity team are far behind us, on the other side of the field. Chris and I move in perfect synchrony, and the very air parts before us.  
  
¬† Nothing can touch us. Not snow. Not even time.  
  
¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† TOM√ÅS  
  
¬† Time‚Äôs up. The small clock on the bookshelf strikes ten with an annoying little tune, and I thumb through the tabs in front of me at supersonic speed. C‚Äômon, c‚Äômon, c‚Äômon.  
  
¬† It only took superglue‚Äîstrategically squirted on the desk drawers of my favorite Spanish teacher, Mr. Look-At-Me-Strutting-My-Stuff-Like-A-Walking-Midlife-Crisis‚Äîfor Far and me to find our way to the administrative office. But it took both our student IDs before we managed to jiggle the lock on Principal Trenton‚Äôs door. And it‚Äôll all be for nothing if I can‚Äôt find the file I‚Äôm looking for. I scan the folders in the filing cabinet. When an elbow pokes my side, I startle. ‚ÄúDammit, Far. What the hell?‚Äù  
  
¬† Fareed rolls his eyes and gestures for me to keep quiet. Someone‚Äôs in the hallway, he mouths. He tiptoes back to the door.  
  
¬† Crap.  
  
¬† How do I explain this? ‚ÄúNo, ma‚Äôam, I‚Äôm not doing anything, just breaking into school records‚Äù?  
  
¬† Whatever. I‚Äôm sure I have a legal right to see my own permanent record, so I can always use that as my excuse. The fact that these folders just happened to be ‚ÄúLast Names, A‚ÄìC‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúLast Names, M‚ÄìN‚Äù is nothing more than a coincidence. No one knows whose file I‚Äôm looking for, except Far. And even he doesn‚Äôt know the whole reason.  
  
¬† If anything, I can always ‚Äúfind‚Äù Al-Sahar, Fareed as a cover. The school administration can‚Äôt even file his name right.  
  
¬† Still.  
  
¬† A door opens and closes. A lock clicks.  
  
¬† Footsteps squeak on the linoleum outside the administrative office.  
  
¬† Footsteps that pause before the principal‚Äôs door‚Äîour door.  
  
¬† I quietly push the file drawer shut. Better not to stir up trouble‚Äîmore trouble‚Äîif I get caught red-handed.  
  
¬† Far and I both hold our breath.  
  
¬† After what feels like forever, the footsteps move on. Whomever it was, they‚Äôre not out to get us. Not today.  
/> ¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† AUTUMN  
  
¬† ‚Äú‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all a matter of the decisions you make, today and every day. Your behavior reflects not only on yourself but also on your parents, your family, and your school.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHere at Opportunity, we pride ourselves on shaping the doctors, lawyers, and politicians of tomorrow. And it‚Äôs the choices you make now that will determine your future. You have to ask yourself how you can become the best you can be. Ask not what your school can do for you but what you can do for you.‚Äù  
  
¬† Trenton holds the microphone loosely while she scans the crowd, as if memorizing every single face. So many students come and go, leaving nothing but the faintest impression, names scratched into desks and graffitied onto bathroom stalls, yet she knows us all.  
  
¬† All our hopes. All our heartbreaks. All our sleepless nights.  
  
¬† Her eyes linger on me, and my neck burns. I reach for the chair to my right, but it remains as it was when the assembly started. Empty.  
  
¬† To my left, Sylv groans. ‚ÄúAfter all these years, you‚Äôd think she‚Äôd come up with something more original.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to be the best you can be?‚Äù The words come out harsher than I intend.  
  
¬† She grumbles.  
  
¬† In truth, Sylv will have plenty of colleges to choose from. She‚Äôs a shoo-in for all her dream schools. And I should be happy for her. I am happy for her.  
  
¬† But for me, college is the only way out of this misery, and Dad sure as hell isn‚Äôt going to pay my ride. Not to study dance. ‚ÄúLook what happened to your mother,‚Äù he‚Äôd say, as if I haven‚Äôt counted the days, hours, minutes since Mom‚Äôs accident. ‚ÄúDance took everything from her. No daughter of mine is going into that business. Not if I can stop it.‚Äù  
  
¬† So he tries to stop me‚Äîevery day. And with Mom gone, there‚Äôs no one to stop him. Not from drinking. Not from hitting me. There‚Äôs no one to keep our family from falling apart.  
  
¬† I grip my crumpled coffee cup, grab the threadbare denim messenger bag from under my seat, and block out Ty‚Äôs voice in the back of my mind. My brother would tell me that Principal Trenton‚Äôs words are truer than I think, that the world is at my fingertips and it‚Äôs up to me to make my future the best it can be.  
  
¬† I tried that and I lost. Now I‚Äôd rather escape.  
  
¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† SYLV  
  
¬† I sink deep into my seat and glance at the empty place next to Autumn. He‚Äôs not coming after all. He‚Äôd have been here by now. He won‚Äôt come. I‚Äôm safe here.  
  
¬† He won‚Äôt come.  
  
¬† The knot in my stomach unfurls and recoils with every twist and turn of my mind. I could ask Autumn about Tyler, but she‚Äôs lost in memories. Today is two years since the accident. She refuses to share her grief with me‚Äîor anyone. Even when she smiles, she isn‚Äôt the girl she used to be.  
  
¬† And I miss her.  
  
¬† Some days, when she thinks no one is watching, she still moves across the floor as if she‚Äôs flying. La golondrina, Mam√° used to call her. The swallow. All grace and beauty. When Autumn dances, all her worry falls away and she shines.  
  
¬† I wish she could dance forever.  
  
¬† Madre de Dios, how I wish I could watch her dance forever.  
  
¬† Instead, it is another Monday. Life goes on. The assembly is over, and Autumn holds herself ramrod straight. I‚Äôm the only one who knows she‚Äôll fly out of this cage and leave us all behind as soon as she can.  
  
¬† Meanwhile, next period is the last review for my AP U.S. History midterm, and I haven‚Äôt even touched my books. Mam√° had another one of her bad spells over break. We were supposed to go into town together last Saturday, but when Abuelo brought the car around, she barely recognized him. She didn‚Äôt want to leave the house. She didn‚Äôt understand where we were going. I sat with her for hours, talked to her‚Äîlisten, Mam√°‚Äîtold her the stories that wove our family around her. She was disoriented for days afterward, and I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that with every day that passes, she slips away like starlight at dawn.  
  
¬† At least history suits me. You already know if those stories will end happily.

¬†Chapter Two  
  
¬† 10:02‚Äì10:04 A.M.  
  
¬† TOM√ÅS  
  
¬† I reach for the bowl on top of the desk and pop a few mints into my mouth. Far peeks around the principal‚Äôs door. When he gives the all clear, I open the filing cabinet again. I haven‚Äôt lost much work. Just time.  
  
¬† Principal Trenton may still live in the pre-digital era, but she‚Äôs like a cyborg. She always speaks until ten sharp, leaving five minutes for announcements before the bell. By the end of the assembly, everyone has to run to make it to class on time for third period. Well, in theory. The teachers and other personnel are in the auditorium too, and they don‚Äôt run.  
  
¬† So everyone pushes to leave, then strolls, dawdles, sneaks out for a smoke and some air (the two aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive, thank you very much). After all, even nicotine and tar smell better than what my sis once described as our ‚Äúodor-torium,‚Äù a unique blend of testosterone, sweat, and burned coffee.  
  
¬† But we‚Äôre cutting it far too close. ‚ÄúI hate paperwork.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe you should stay on the farm then,‚Äù Fareed drawls. ‚ÄúHonest work and hard labor don‚Äôt require brains.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hilarious.‚Äù My fingers skim his file, and I pull it out of the drawer. ‚ÄúD‚Äôyou want to see the letter of recommendation Mr. O‚ÄôBrian wrote for your college applications?‚Äù  
  
¬† He holds out his hands, and I toss him the file. A few sheets flutter from the folder before Far catches it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBarbarian.‚Äù  
  
¬† I snort. ‚ÄúSorry. Not sorry.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI look so young and innocent in this picture,‚Äù Fareed muses, staring at his cover sheet. For most of our class, the picture used by the administration is three years old, taken when we enrolled as freshmen. In his case, however‚Äî  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat was taken last year!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow you‚Äôve corrupted me. Without your brilliant ideas, I‚Äôd have been a straight-A student, never in trouble with the law, girls following me everywhere.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù I pull another folder out of the filing cabinet. ‚ÄúKeep telling yourself that.‚Äù  
  
¬† Fareed makes another comment, but I‚Äôm not paying attention. A familiar picture stares at me from the cover sheet.  
  
¬† Bingo.  
  
¬† Browne, Tyler. Gelled blond hair, pale eyes, and an oh-so-familiar blank look. The one time his eyes weren‚Äôt glossed over with contempt was when I slammed his head into a locker. My fingers itch to do it again.  
  
¬† Does the administration note criminal charges in student records? Probably not when the files are this easy to access. Definitely not when said student dropped out at the end of last year. Besides, I don‚Äôt even know if he has a criminal record. According to his grades, he was a perfectly respectable C student. Three years at Opportunity and Tyler coasted through all his classes.  
  
¬† He only‚Äîspectacularly‚Äîfailed Humanity 101.  
  
¬† The latest note in his file is unmistakable though: Reenrolling. Effective immediately.  
  
¬† Sylvia mentioned it this weekend. It was the first time she‚Äôs confided in me in months. She looked ready to puke her guts out, she was so scared, but she refused to tell me why. So here I am, breaking into school records. To make sure she‚Äôs safe. Twin-brother privileges.  
  
¬† Not that I‚Äôll ever admit to that or even hint that I care. Twin-brother reputation.  
  
/> ¬† I lean against the principal‚Äôs desk and read.  
  
¬† Date of birth, address‚Äîboring. Emergency contact information for father, mother deceased. Last school, date of admission‚Äînothing I don‚Äôt already know. Present class: not applicable. Not yet.  
  
¬† SAT score: 2140.  
  
¬† Huh. A closet genius.  
  
¬† Maybe that explains why, despite his bravado, Tyler never made good on any of his threats. He may be a maggot, but he‚Äôs the smartest kind: a harmless one.  
  
¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† AUTUMN  
  
¬† My back aches. I roll my shoulders to loosen the knotted muscles. Sylv lingers instead of rejoining the rest of her class. She cracks her knuckles with sharp snaps. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù I hesitate.  
  
¬† I woke up drenched in sweat last night, expecting a knock at the door like two years ago. But this morning was breakfast as usual. Ty was nowhere to be found, and after this weekend, I didn‚Äôt mind. Figures. Dad didn‚Äôt bother to get up. He started‚Äîor never stopped‚Äîdrinking last night. These days, he doesn‚Äôt even try to hide it. When Mom was still alive, he only drank when she was away and only during the darkest times. He still knew how to smile then, and he could make both Ty and me laugh.  
  
¬† Now he‚Äôs angry at the entire world, at anything that reminds him of Mom.  
  
¬† At me.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt know how to put all that into words. I‚Äôm not okay. I haven‚Äôt been okay in a long time. It isn‚Äôt just Mom‚Äôs death. Dad‚Äîsometimes I‚Äôm afraid.  
  
¬† And Ty‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll lose Ty too.  
  
¬† But Sylv and Ty hate each other. How can I begin to make her understand?  
  
¬† She places her hand on my arm, then remembers where we are and nervously tucks a long, black curl behind her ears. Her bright-blue top matches her eyeliner, which makes her eyes sparkle. At Opportunity, where so many of us prefer to stay hidden, she‚Äôs the brightest spotlight on the darkest stage. She looks at me expectantly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs understandable, you know. Anniversaries can be difficult. You can be sad. No one will judge you, least of all me.‚Äù  
  
¬† I nod, but the words still won‚Äôt form. The voices ebb and flow around us as students climb the raked aisles between the four blocks of seating. Sylv‚Äôs eyes flick to the other side of the auditorium, where some of the football players are getting loud.

¬†I shrug. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù  
  
¬† She‚Äôd never understand. No one does.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm counting down the minutes to seventh period, when the music room behind the stage is dark and deserted. In the shadows, I‚Äôll be alone.  
  
¬† I‚Äôll be safe.  
  
¬† Sylv opens her mouth, but before she can say anything, a girl from her class appears at her elbow‚ÄîAsha, I think. She used to get into arguments with my brother before he dropped out. I can‚Äôt‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want to keep up with all of them. They will only bind me to this place, and it hurts so much to care.  
  
¬† Asha clings to her AP U.S. History textbook. Under strands of rainbow-colored hair, her mouth quirks up in a half smile. She whispers something. Sylv tenses before she laughs, her voice rising above the crowd. ‚ÄúContrary to popular opinion, I‚Äôm not looking forward to midterms.‚Äù  
  
¬† Asha rolls her eyes. ‚ÄúYou have nothing to worry about.‚Äù  
  
¬† Sylv blushes, but Asha‚Äôs right: Sylv‚Äôs a straight-A student. The teachers adore her. She couldn‚Äôt flunk an exam if she tried.  
  
¬† Asha turns to me, and that‚Äôs my cue. I plaster on a fake smile. ‚ÄúMidterms aren‚Äôt until next week. And I had better things to do than study over break.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPhilistine.‚Äù Sylv sighs. ‚ÄúHow do I put up with you?‚Äù  
  
¬† Because I‚Äôm yours.  
  
¬† The buttons on Asha‚Äôs bag clink against each other. She flicks a purple lock of hair out of her face. ‚ÄúNo stress? Lucky you.‚Äù  
  
¬† Lucky me. Before I can say anything, Sylv beats me to it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo what did you do?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù  
  
¬† Around us, the drone of voices becomes louder, more agitated. The first few moments after Trenton‚Äôs speeches are always a mess, with everyone tumbling over each other trying to get out, but this is far more chaotic than usual.  
  
¬† A teacher pushes through. Probably to see what the holdup is.  
  
¬† Asha grins. ‚ÄúAll of break? Absolutely nothing? C‚Äômon, spill.‚Äù  
  
¬† Sylv‚Äôs eyes are soft and questioning, and I nibble on my lip. I don‚Äôt want to let her down. ‚ÄúI found an old video recording of my mother‚Äôs first Swan Lake in the attic this weekend. It was her audition for the Royal Ballet. She wasn‚Äôt much older than me.‚Äù  
  
¬† It‚Äôs not salacious news, so I expect Asha to be disappointed, but she leans in closer. ‚ÄúWas it good?‚Äù  
  
¬† This surprises a smile out of me.  
  
¬† Opportunity High is a county high school, with students from all the small surrounding towns. Asha isn‚Äôt one of us. She isn‚Äôt Opportunity, where everyone knows everything about Mom and me. She isn‚Äôt part of our home turf of familiar street names, churches, and shared secrets.  
  
¬† In Opportunity, everyone knows Mom danced around the world at every great company: London, Moscow, New York. She saw more countries than all of us combined. She told me about her travels and made me restless. For how much that memory of her hurts, watching her dance never does. ‚ÄúShe was amazing.‚Äù  
  
¬† Sylv‚Äôs shoulder touches mine. Her warm smile anchors me. It‚Äôs as if all of Opportunity falls away. We‚Äôre lost between making a home and escaping one. It won‚Äôt be long before our secrets choke us, before she finally realizes I don‚Äôt deserve her and she leaves me too.

¬† CLAIRE  
  
¬† After another lap, the crisp air becomes refreshing, though I‚Äôd never admit that to Coach. Winter ought to stick to December, to Christmas, and leave us be. We need as many hours as we can find to prepare for our next meet if we want to keep up our winning streak.  
  
¬† My JROTC drill team will start practice again soon too. It‚Äôs only the youngest cadets‚Äô second year of training, and they‚Äôre still finding their stride. I have enough on my mind without the frost.  
  
¬† I glance sideways to find Chris grinning at me. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre brooding.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAm not.‚Äù  
  
¬† He snorts.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow was your break?‚Äù We ask the same question at the same time, and I laugh.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt was weird not having Trace home for Matt‚Äôs birthday, even though he‚Äôs, quote, a high school student and all grown up, so why do we worry so much?‚Äù My baby brother tries not to show how much this cold weather is hurting his joints or how much he misses our sister, who is far away in a foreign desert. All three of us, we‚Äôve lost our flow. ‚ÄúWe had a few minutes of video chat after you left.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow is deployment treating her?‚Äù  
  
¬† I tread carefully. ‚ÄúHer patrols are uneventful. Just the way I like it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Chris nods. His father, Lieutenant Colonel West, is preparing for his seventh tour. We both know what it‚Äôs like to have part of your mind on the other side of the world, wondering what‚Äôs happening in the sand and unforgiving heat. It‚Äôs for the pride‚Äîand expectation‚Äîof our families that we serve.  
  
¬† Even me. And I would. If only I could be like Tracy, who is everything I want to be, everything I should be‚Äîbrave, resilient, certain of herself. Everything I‚Äôm not.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAt least Matt hasn‚Äôt had any fevers,‚Äù I say after half a lap. It was the highlight of our winter break. Ever since Matt started at Opportunity, he‚Äôs been doing better. The lupus still affects his joints, and most days he needs his crutches. But he‚Äôs disguised them as lightsabers and claims they‚Äôre for dueling. Jedi against JROTC. ‚ÄúHe loves having his friends here. It made the start of the new year less daunting.‚Äù For all of us, I add silently. It‚Äôs good to know Matt‚Äôs not alone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWill you talk to him about joining our cadets next year?‚Äù Chris asks. ‚ÄúTo keep up tradition?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù This conversation is another familiar rhythm, and I settle into it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood. He still has three years. Opportunity wouldn‚Äôt be the same without one of you in JROTC.‚Äù  
  
¬† I muster a smile, though it probably resembles a grimace. Next year. When I‚Äôm gone. When Chris is far away. When everything will be different, regardless of whether there‚Äôs a Morgan in Opportunity‚Äôs JROTC.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you looking forward to visiting West Point?‚Äù I ask after we turn to the long side of the track.  
  
¬† Chris shrugs. He was always a no-brainer for any military academy. We celebrated when he got his letter of assurance and his congressional nomination. It‚Äôs everything he ever dreamed about.  
  
¬† But today he seems preoccupied too. On this first day of our last semester, the entire senior class is counting down to graduation. One school break left. One more summer before adulthood. Before we broke up, Tyler told me the best part of high school was getting out ASAP. Still, I wish it didn‚Äôt have to end yet. It‚Äôll be hard to say good-bye to our team, to our cadets, to each other. Life will be grayer without seeing Chris all day, every day.  
  
¬† So we run. Not just in circles around the track. We run toward all that is waiting for us. We run together while we still can.

¬† SYLV  
  
¬† Autumn lingers. Her gray-and-blue eyes are conflicted, but those rare moments when she talks about her mother are like the dawn, and when she opens up, she is the sun. I don‚Äôt want to see her hurt, but it‚Äôs still better than watching her erect walls around herself.  
  
¬† My hand twitches by my side, itching to hold Autumn‚Äôs. But I remain motionless so I won‚Äôt spook her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe performed ‚ÄòThe Dying Swan,‚Äô which seems ironic now. She was young and careless and so‚Ä¶so fragile. I don‚Äôt remember her like that. She always seemed so strong to me.‚Äù  
  
¬† Only a few years after that audition, Joni Browne became principal dancer at the Royal Ballet. She was unconquerable, like Autumn was when she and her mother were together.  
  
¬† Around us, people grumble and wonder why we‚Äôre not outside yet, but I want to hold on to this moment between classes a little longer.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you know what you‚Äôll dance yet?‚Äù I prompt.  
  
¬† Asha perks up. ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre a dancer too! Are you auditioning already?‚Äù  
  
¬† Autumn glances at me sharply. She rar  
ely talks about dancing anymore.  
  
¬† Don‚Äôt worry, I mouth. Asha‚Äôll understand. She‚Äôs good people.  
  
¬† Autumn‚Äôs been training in the music room for months‚Äîand I‚Äôve been sending out her applications. Her father may hate her for it, but I‚Äôd be a lousy girlfriend if I didn‚Äôt see how much it meant to her. It‚Äôs her chance out of here, and she deserves to be happy. Even though she can audition at schools closer to home or wait until she‚Äôs a senior, she has her sights set on New York.  
  
¬† We both did once.  
  
¬† I stuff my hand in my pocket, and my fingers curl around the letter of admittance I‚Äôve been carrying around for almost two weeks now.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm auditioning for Juilliard,‚Äù Autumn says quietly. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm still deciding on my solo.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy piano teacher always says there‚Äôs no truer music than feeling,‚Äù Asha shares.  
  
¬† She told me she wants to travel the world before she majors in music. She and Autumn could be friends if they only knew each other a little better. If only Autumn knew a lot of people a little better, maybe she wouldn‚Äôt always be alone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe says music should have heartbreak and happiness, storm clouds and stars, as long as there‚Äôs emotion. I think that‚Äôs true for dance too.‚Äù  
  
¬† Autumn lowers her guard and smiles in slow motion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about dancing an original composition instead of something that‚Äôs been choreographed for others. Before‚Äîwhen I still had lessons‚ÄîMom and I talked about it.‚Äù  
  
¬† She never told me that. It‚Äôs like the two of them are in their own universe, where everything around them glistens with the possibility of creation. And I‚Äôm left with bleak Opportunity and nothing more.  
  
¬† I inch toward the aisle. ‚ÄúThere you go. You show them who you are and they can‚Äôt say no.‚Äù  
  
¬† Autumn half turns and grins, sending butterflies through my chest. ‚ÄúTease.‚Äù She sobers. ‚ÄúHave you heard from Brown yet?‚Äù  
  
¬† A freshman bumps into my elbow, and I let go of the letter. ‚ÄúNo, not yet.‚Äù  
  
¬† Because what can I tell her? That I have the ticket out of town she‚Äôs been longing for? That I don‚Äôt even know what to do with it? Before Mam√° fell ill, I would‚Äôve leaped at this chance. But how can I leave now?  
  
¬† Autumn would never understand.  
  
¬† She winces in sympathy. Asha grimaces.  
  
¬† In the row below ours, a flock of freshman girls giggle. Beside them, a boy frantically flips through a textbook while one of his friends rolls his eyes. All around us, people chatter about their breaks, classes, midterms.  
  
¬† If anyone wants to understand Opportunity‚Äîtruly understand it‚Äîthis moment between Principal Trenton‚Äôs speech and class is the right time. The week has started, and there‚Äôs no escaping it, but we start it together.  
  
¬† And soon‚Äîhopefully‚Äîwe‚Äôll have fresh air to breathe.  
  
¬† Except we‚Äôre all moving, but no one gets out.  
  
¬† To: Sis  
  
¬† I know you‚Äôre at practice, but don‚Äôt worry so much, okay? :) I like going to school. And I‚Äôm a lot tougher than I look.  
  
¬† To: Sis  
  
¬† (PS: The speech was totally the same. You could do it and no one would know the difference.)  
  
¬† Chapter Three  
  
¬† 10:04‚Äì10:05 A.M.  
  
¬† AUTUMN  
  
¬† Asha got under my skin. Sylv doesn‚Äôt understand dancing is more than a dream, more than a career path‚Äîit‚Äôs my heartbeat. Asha gets it.  
  
¬† I wish I knew more about her, about her music. Before I can ask, we reach the aisle. The mass of students surrounds me and huddles closer with every step. Backpacks bump into me, shoulders touch. I‚Äôm not sure why no one is leaving the auditorium. There are too many people here.  
  
¬† My fingers curl around the charms on my bracelet: a silver ballet shoe and the handmade Venetian mask Mom brought back from Italy one year. The green paint on the mask has faded and the edges are worn off, but the familiar shapes are soothing and help me find my balance.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs fleeting.  
  
¬† Asha gives me a shrug and a smile. ‚ÄúGood luck with your auditions,‚Äù she calls, squeezing through the crowd. And she walks away.  
  
¬† Everyone does in the end.  
  
¬† I take a step back and wait for the crowd to pass me.  
  
¬† I have no friends here but Sylv, no family but a brother who disappears on me and a father who despises me. Only dancing keeps me alive. It will free me. And I can‚Äôt let anything get in the way of that.  
  
¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† CLAIRE  
  
¬† The track opens up before us. After another lap, Chris‚Äôs mood brightens. He‚Äôs always been able to do that‚Äîthrow off his worries like a winter coat. ‚ÄúTime to run. Have fun, Sarge.‚Äù  
  
¬† I smirk. ‚ÄúCommander.‚Äù  
  
¬† He winks and, as if he didn‚Äôt just run a mile, pulls ahead, leaving me to stare at his back. Sure, he‚Äôs a long-distance runner, so he‚Äôs not even halfway through his rounds. But it only hammers home how ridiculously slow I am today.  
  
¬† That changes right now.  
  
¬† When I pass Coach again, I give him a small nod, and he punches the buttons on his stopwatch. I pick up the pace.  
  
¬† We‚Äôve been working on this strategy since last season‚Äîbuild up my schedule so I can keep a stable pace through the better part of the race and still have enough left in me for a final half-track sprint.  
  
¬† Everything around me disappears. Every thought of Matt and Tracy. The burning pain in my calves. The nagging worry of managing drill meets and JROTC. My three teammates, who are each on their own stretch of the track, working on their own personal records.  
  
¬† Everything disappears but the cadence of my feet and the cold air on my cheeks.  
  
¬† When I‚Äôm running, I can finally breathe.  
  
¬† I sprint across the finish line and look over to see Coach grin.  
  
¬† The bleachers beside the track are covered in a white haze. At the steps near the finish line, someone has scratched WE MAKE HISTORY into the wood.  
  
¬† A smile tugs at my lips. Those three words are Coach Lindt‚Äôs take on our school motto. His Any Given Sunday motivational speech. And it works because we have made history, and I don‚Äôt doubt we‚Äôll be competing in the state championships for the seventh year in a row.  
  
¬† This is my team. This is where I belong.  
  
¬† Here and now, we are everyone.  
  
¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† TOM√ÅS  
  
¬† When the file doesn‚Äôt give me any answers, I shove it back and slam the drawer shut for good measure. Pointless. Ridiculous. Just plain stupid. Tyler‚Äôs reenrolling and my sister‚Äôs terrified, but I do not know why. There‚Äôs absolutely nothing I can do to make her feel better.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow about we skip the rest of the day?‚Äù Fareed leans against the door frame, one foot propped up on a visitor‚Äôs chair. He uses the tip of his folder to push a strand of hair out of his face. ‚ÄúI hate Mondays.‚Äù  
  
¬† I drop the role of protective brother and shrug back into my guise as Opportunity High‚Äôs most infamous student. It fits me like a well-worn glove. ‚ÄúDude, we all do. Mondays are the worst. But I‚Äôm working on my tough-guy image. If I don‚Äôt suffer with the rest of you, it‚Äôd ruin my rep.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, admit it. You‚Äôre just afraid Trenton will tell your grandfather. What‚Äôs the worst he can do? Beat you up for cutting? You know the old man doesn‚Äôt mind.‚Äù  
  
¬† I stretch. ‚ÄúI guess.‚Äù  
  
¬† The thing is, I am afraid. When Fareed moved here, I was Opportunity‚Äôs favorite bad boy. No one actually told me that, but I can only assume they were blinded by my brilliance.  
  
¬† This year, we share that dubious honor, and only Far knows I‚Äôve been tiptoeing the lines. Admittedly, a day without detention is like a day without sunshine. Or rainbows or kittens or that sort of crap. But I do my homework. I maintain shockingly decent grades. Principal Trenton and I have come to an agreement: I don‚Äôt break the rules too much and don‚Äôt skip my classes. I don‚Äôt get caught pulling stunts, like breaking into school records‚Äîeven for my sis, though she‚Äôs worth the risk. I behav  
e and Trenton won‚Äôt call home to Granddad.  
  
¬† Not because I‚Äôm worried about his anger or his disappointment. Hell, I‚Äôm head and shoulders taller than he is; he‚Äôs not that intimidating.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll tell Mam√°. And I don‚Äôt want her to remember me like this.  
  
¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† SYLV  
  
¬† My hand grazes Autumn‚Äôs wrist as I move down the row of seats to try to see what‚Äôs going on at the back of the auditorium. She hates it when we touch in public, but these past couple of months, she‚Äôs been the only one keeping me standing. She‚Äôs so set on leaving Opportunity that I think she‚Äôll tear me in two when she does.  
  
¬† I wish I could leave too. I wish I could stay.  
  
¬† The students around me are motionless, and the buzz has deepened to a murmur of unease. Something‚Äôs wrong. What‚Äôs happening? Locked. The doors are locked.  
  
¬† One of the cheerleaders grumbles that this isn‚Äôt the time for jokes. A few seats away from her, a freshman laughs nervously. At the end of every aisle, students crowd around the double doors that would normally swing open but today don‚Äôt budge. Near the stage, someone shouts that the emergency exit is locked too. We‚Äôre locked in.  
  
¬† The bell rings.  
  
¬† One set of doors to my left opens. Fluorescent light filters in around a lone figure. For a moment, I think it‚Äôs my twin brother, finding yet another way to prove he is the least interested, most interesting student at Opportunity. It‚Äôs the kind of prank he‚Äôd pull, locking us all in. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôd have done with him. Once.  
  
¬† But blond locks peek out from under a black knit cap. Strangely, that‚Äôs the first thing I notice‚Äîthe unruly blond hair that frames that too-familiar face. And with it come the memories. A wild grin. A dangerous hunger. The nervous whispers around me may as well come from my own mind. Not now. Not today. Not yet.  
  
¬† No, please.  
  
¬† It takes me a second to process his raised arm.  
  
¬† At the top of the aisles, everyone pauses and all eyes turn toward the shadow in the doorway. The word ‚Äúgun‚Äù floats all around me before the crowd silences, stills. I don‚Äôt feel panic or shock. There‚Äôs just a sense of defeat.

1mxggmd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxggmd,AJLT could‚Äôve learned a thing or two from the Real Housewives,"Okay, so And Just Like That finally ended‚Ä¶ They managed to take the writing absolutely nowhere and left viewers with both rage and relief when it was over. 

It had me thinking how RHONY‚Äôs truth was always stranger than fiction. These moments felt more SATC for me than anything in the newer series. Honestly, the writers should‚Äôve just shadowed the Housewives for a season and taken notes. üòÇ

1. A classic walk of shame ‚Üí Pat Fields herself would be proud of Sonja‚Äôs morning after look (torn dress, lover‚Äôs tshirt, sunglasses and cap like a modern day Breakfast at Tiffany‚Äôs). She‚Äôs late for facials with Kristen who is waiting at the apartment. And then said facialist reveals that Luann is a dom more or less and has a thing for short guys. üèÜ

2. As a viewer I love this scene of Ramona walking into Bethenny‚Äôs apartment to dish on the drama at John‚Äôs party the night before, when we meet Rey üòá. It feels almost visceral, like you are one of the girlfriends. 
‚ÄúI want a glass of Ramona Pinot Grigio, a glass of skinny girl margarita, you know, with the rim (B: okay you want a rimjob), and then I have a story to tell you ladies, that you would not believe‚Äù. 

3. The secondary blowback of John‚Äôs party ft, Rey, is this little snippet of Luann and Sonj when Lu is staying at Chateau Morgan. The freezing townhouse (heating is expensive!) means the girls are wearing slippers and fur, drinking coffee while reading Page Six in the kitchen, catching up on the night before. Lu reads the headline ‚ÄúJohn Mahdessian shouted, I took out the grime!‚Äù It‚Äôs glamour and girlishness.
I remember watching this for the first time, and even then knew I would feel nostalgic for it. Not to mention the sundial convo that followed‚Ä¶ üåû

4. This one is so classic SATC. But what do you do when you‚Äôre dating a hot young artist, younger than you are, and he wants to paint you? And he paints you with jowls and saggy boobs? You give him a kiss for trying and then party hella hard at your hosted event, lip syncing to opera and booting out any guests dressed like a dominatrix. 


5. Despite Carrie‚Äôs attempts to write about sex with an ounce of adventure or open-mindedness, Ramona was lifting weights and interviewing about how to date in the 80s, the era of sex and greed and when ‚Äúpushing your t**s out for you something‚Äù. Long live basted turkey ü¶É 


6. While I do feel like SATC did nod to the era of ~dogs as accessories, this seemed like a perfect close to that era. What happens when accessory dogs pass away? It Girls call the fire department to perform CPR on their dogs. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this was really devastating for Tins, and heartbreaking to hear about, but the fire department furrowed many a brow‚Ä¶


7. Charlotte may have Poughkeepsied in her pants in Mexico, but Ramona was bound to the wheelchair in Cartagena. Everyone was so over it, even hating her from the car at the airport (and later when they had to push her through town on their night out). This one is a close tie to the Tequila MX pizza pie with no cheese face, but it was too reminiscent of Samantha at the funeral üñ§


I‚Äôm missing so many iconic scenes here help me out! What scenes do you think are better than (the new) fiction?

Between them I spent ¬£3.5k on hen dos, wedding stuff etc. I had bought a house the same year, I was quite literally SKINT. Throughout the whole run up to the wedding I was the only person out of the bridal party who was present, the other bridesmaids did not participate in hyping her up, organise anything for hens and even caused animosity because I was the only one doing it. I did the itinerary‚Äôs, hen games, organised letters to the bride and put the album together for it, I went to London with her separately to find her wedding dress - the others didn‚Äôt. 

Anyway‚Ä¶ fast forward to a year later (today) and she‚Äôs messaged me asking why I never bought her a wedding present and feels hurt that I didn‚Äôt. I apologised and said I just didn‚Äôt have money, that I‚Äôve still not financially recovered yet and that what I wanted to do was  a personal gift (I was making a coffee table book of the lead up to the wedding and wedding day, for both her and her husbands journeys), but explained that I had asked a few times for photos from the stag but haven‚Äôt received them so have been unable to do what I wanted to do. She came back asking if I was blaming the husband for them not having a gift. Not what I meant but it did play a part in it. For me, I feel all my effort on the lead up wasn‚Äôt enough now.

**WHITEOUT**

On November 18th 1996, my stepfather officially went missing. My mother tearfully told me over the phone as I sat in my cubicle. I tried to get her to calm down, reassuring her that things would be okay, whispering as quietly as possible in my office, my home away from home just like any other late-stage yuppie. She muttered through yelps about how he left, said he‚Äôd be back in a few hours, hadn‚Äôt come home and the police couldn‚Äôt find anything. After a little bit of apprehension, I understood simply that she needed me, and told her I‚Äôd come back home to check in on her. With a whimper of understanding at the plan, she hung up. I told my boss I had a family emergency and fled back across the East River to get packing.

I rushed in and started to gather some clothes for the drive, and mirroring me was Nevada, packing up her stuff, preparing to move out following our break up the month prior. She was standing there in one of my flannels that had assimilated itself into her wardrobe. Because of the constantly blasting heat during the winter in the apartment, she was wearing jean shorts and no socks. Her skin was pale like mine, a byproduct of our Michigander upbringing, and her hair was silky brunette with hints of magenta peaking through where she missed on re-dyeing. I only stared for a second before shuffling over to my closet. Nevada and I had split amicably but trying to keep living together just made things awkward, and she felt it was time for her to get her own place. I didn‚Äôt say anything to her when I entered, but she noticed how frantically I was moving.¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on, Nate?‚Äù

I told her after a moment of recollection,

‚ÄúMy uh... um, Martin went missing‚Äù

‚ÄúMartin, like, your stepdad?

‚ÄúYeah, and my mom kinda needs me right now so I gotta.. Head back to Arrow Creek. I‚Äôm sorry I won‚Äôt be around to help you move out. I just gotta-‚Äù.

I stopped, surprised to find her hand on my shoulder and her head against my arm.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming with you‚Äù.

I looked down at her with a sad smile and we said nothing more, just continued to pack. It was the closest I felt to her in a while, even though things weren‚Äôt bad per se, I just missed it is all. Why she would drop everything to go back to our Michigan backwater? No clue. She liked my family enough and they definitely liked her, but she was never particularly eager to see them. Her family had left Arrow Creek ages ago, moving somewhere in the middle of Ohio, so it's not like they were there for her to see. My insecurities wanted me to believe pity was her reasoning, but I think truthfully she just cared enough to see it was a rough time for us both, and I appreciated her tagging along despite the lapsing distance.¬†

The next morning, we trudged through the nightly puddles about half a street away to my SUV. From Brooklyn to Arrow Creek, Michigan was about a twelve hour drive without the looming threat of¬† traffic. Along the way, I turned the radio to a local news channel which warned of bad weather coming:

‚Äú108.4 WIMI with a breaking weather bulletin, I‚Äôm Toby Bell- we‚Äôve got a large blizzard coming in this week, currently striking over the great lakes. Record snow is being predicted from around 36-40 inches coming in around the East Bay and Houghton Lake areas by Wednesday the 20th. It‚Äôs not particularly dangerous for you northern natives out there, but caution is advised on the roads as visibility might be impaired. Make sure you bundle up if you have to head out with temperatures dropping close to -7 degrees Fahrenheit on Wednesday and staying near zero until Saturday, so you might wanna stay in and get cozy while the whole thing passes. We‚Äôll be back with more Monday Grunge-day in a bit, back to DJ Keith Hodder with *Alice in Chains* coming up next‚Äù.

Snow wasn‚Äôt unusual in Northern Michigan, so I was pretty unphased as a ‚Äúnative northerner‚Äù, and it sounded like a decent change of pace from the cold rains in the city. Nevada had seemingly no reaction either, just her general curiosity fluttering through her brown eyes as she watched the highways drift by out the window. The ride was mostly uneventful with Nevada and I trying to stave off boredom, singing along to old CDs and playing road trip games. We stopped for a short stint at McDonalds, and afterwards the food and car heater combined to put Nevada down for a nap. I turned off the radio so as to not wake her, and in that moment, I had the time by myself to think about Martin.

¬†Martin and I had a strange but mostly-positive relationship. He came into my life when I was around thirteen, and he tried his best to be a father figure to me. At that age though I started to not feel so keen on listening to authority, especially some dude I barely knew who was just suddenly moving in. Looking back I regret my attitude towards him, because he was always patient with me even when I acted like an asshole. He took me fishing, we went to Tigers games in the summer and Lions games in the winter. He picked me up from the police station after my friends and I spray painted dicks on the middle school, not even angry, just soft-spoken and wondering why. He tried to give me advice and taught me to be patient with myself just as much as he was me. He and mom took Nevada and I‚Äôs prom pictures, he was sad but supportive of us moving away. I don‚Äôt think I often admitted it to him or myself, but I loved Martin- I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be the same person without him. So while I was really coming for my mom‚Äôs sake, I also needed to know what happened. It wasn‚Äôt like Martin to just vanish like this.

¬†By the time we arrived in Arrow Creek, snow had begun to fall pretty hard with the fresh moonlight illuminating the clouds in a reddish hue. I pulled up to my mother‚Äôs old ranch house, surrounded by tall pines starting to be dusted in white. Wind whistled off the nearby lake making the air feel colder than it was, as harsh warm light poured out through the early evening. I entered without knocking, finding my step siblings Mary Beth and Johnathan running up quickly to greet me. I was rarely around since they were born; they were kids and I was pushing 30, so they kinda just thought of me as an uncle.

‚ÄúUncle Nate!‚Äù they cried, clutching to my legs. After glancing past me they did the same to Nevada.¬†

‚ÄúAunt Nevada!‚Äù

Nevada shot me an awkward smile as she greeted them, they didn‚Äôt know any better. Sitting in Martin‚Äôs easy chair was my mother, completely zoned out watching reruns of *M\*A\*S\*H*. Alan Alda would crack a joke, and she wouldn‚Äôt even smile. Before I had a chance to go greet her, a shadow entered from the kitchen doorway on the left.

It was my father, Steven.¬†

I stared at him, no words escaping my mouth. He turned towards me, a mug of tea in his hand as his eyes met mine, a decades worth of distance between us.¬†

‚ÄúHi, Nate‚Äù.

‚ÄúHi, Dad‚Äù.¬†

That was the extent of our conversation as tension filled the air. It was broken when he spoke to Nevada.

‚ÄúHi Nevada,‚Äù He reached out his hand. ‚ÄúGood to see you again‚Äù.

‚ÄúYou too, Mr. Fischer‚Äù.

She glanced at me vaguely. I could feel her discomfort grow as her fingernails dug into my sleeve as she clung close.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing here, Dad?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd check in on Sharon, given the news and all‚Äù.

He could see the doubt in my eyes as to why he was really here; he stepped closer.

‚ÄúLook, I know you hate me. But I promise you I‚Äôm not trying to do anything to hurt your mother. I‚Äôm just worried about her is all .""

‚ÄúSure, Dad. It‚Äôs very like you‚Äù.

I grabbed the tea from him and walked towards my mother, leaning down next to the chair. Nevada stuck with the kids as they played with my old action figures and cars, a better choice between them and Dad. Mom stared with glazed eyes at the TV in a mindless drone, her actual thoughts elsewhere. I tried to snap her back.

‚ÄúHi, Mom‚Äù.

She blinked and turned towards me, sobbing softly and leaping into a hug over the arm of the chair.

‚ÄúOh Nate, sweetie,‚Äù she said into my jacket, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre home‚Äù.

‚ÄúOf course Mom, Nevada‚Äôs here too, we‚Äôre gonna stay a day or so and help take care of you and the kids‚Äù.

Nevada waltzed over hurriedly to personally reassure her; just the kind of person she is.

‚ÄúYes, Mrs. Forster, anything you need- we‚Äôre here for you‚Äù.

Mom smiled so broken-hearted at us, but also with a lot of comfort beaming through her glassy green eyes. She wiped away a stray tear and nodded at us, softly uttering a thanks as she tried to get lost in her show once again. Nevada and I took our bags from the car and wandered towards the guest room at the end of the hall. The house had my mom‚Äôs room, the kids sharing a room, my dad on the couch in the living room, the guest room and the basement. Mom knew we were split up, but obviously in the state she was in, it wasn‚Äôt of the most importance that we be separated given the circumstances. I would have been fine sharing the bed, not as if it was the first time, but because of my lingering feelings I had to try and come up with a solution; or so I thought.

‚ÄúSo, you take the bed, and I think we may have a cot or folding bed, or something in the basement‚Äù.

She blinked at me.

‚ÄúNate, we can just share the bed‚Äù.

‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, we‚Äôve done it for years, what‚Äôs another night or two?‚Äù	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, it might be weird I don‚Äôt want either of us to be uncomfortable‚Äù.

She could tell I meant that I didn‚Äôt want her to be uncomfortable.

‚ÄúMe sleeping next to you is definitely a lot less uncomfortable than sleeping in the freezing basement.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôre right‚Äù.

¬†As I was getting ready to sleep, I heard soft crying coming from my mothers bedroom. I inched quietly down the hall so as to not wake my Dad from his sofa slumber. I pushed the door to her room open and saw her on the edge of the bed, head in her hands; I rushed over.

‚ÄúHey, hey, c‚Äômon Mom you gotta get some sleep.‚Äù

She was barely comprehensible through her tears.

‚ÄúWhat if he‚Äôs dead?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know that, Mom‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat if he left me? What if he found someone else?‚Äù	‚ÄúMartin‚Äôs not like that Mom, don‚Äôt think like that‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat am I gonna do?‚Äù she choked through her breaths.¬†

I stopped for a moment to come up with something to give her solace.

‚ÄúAlright, look, where did he say he was going?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe said he was going out for a bit of fishing and maybe hunting but had to stop in town first. That was the last I heard from him‚Äù.

‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll head out tomorrow and look for him.‚Äù

Her crying stopped and she looked up at me, wiping away her sniffles.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna find him?‚Äù

‚ÄúI promise I‚Äôll try, now get some sleep‚Äù.

She thanked me before laying down, I turned out her light and said goodnight. I had to really think over what I said as I walked back towards my room. It‚Äôs a promise I made in sincerity but had no idea how to fulfill. How the fuck was I supposed to know where he was? I‚Äôm an accountant not a detective. I mean, I wanted to find him too, but the likelihood of me being able to was miniscule at best. I caught Nevada up to speed when I re-entered the guest room, and without much protest she agreed to go on this sleuthing adventure. She was usually up for anything, so you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be unphased. But to just openly agree to go on an actual missing persons investigation, I expected a bit more questioning. I think she really just wanted to help, playing along if this was a mid-life crisis.

‚ÄúAnything for your family, you know that‚Äù.

I tried my best to face the wall as we slept, and Nevada was all over the place- my favorite cover hog. She looked the same as she always did, a little messy but pretty as always. I felt safe for at least those few hours, like all this shit from the last year wasn‚Äôt going on right now. Why did we even break up? I was constantly working, tired and barely around. She felt kind of stagnant, and wanted to do something else with her life, arts at Pratt affording her many opportunities that weren‚Äôt paying off in the oversaturated job market in Manhattan. Rent was convenient to split, but there was still a lot of emotional tension there. That‚Äôs why she wanted to leave, I think. I can lie to myself and pretend it was amicable, but god I didn‚Äôt wanna lose her after all this time. She was still the only person in the world I could really trust, and to just have her close by felt better than anything, even if it was only for a little while.

The next morning, we tried to head out early. I said goodbye to my Mom and gave a small acknowledgement to my Dad before Nevada and I buttoned up in our winter best and went out to search. He stopped me at the door, the wind and snow already having invaded the yard around us.

‚ÄúYou got your gun, Nate?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I always keep it in the car. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to see out there, you never know if you‚Äôll run into something‚Äù.

I nodded and walked out, into the unknown.

Overnight, the snow had only gotten heavier and a thick fog enveloped the woods. Outside was pure white with shadows of trees and signs only peeking through the dense cloud. With cautious skill, I maneuvered into central Arrow Creek and never before had I seen it so dead. Even with a population of 1,100, you‚Äôd think we would‚Äôve seen somebody walking a dog or something but there was really no one, only the occasional state snow plow barreling through every 10 minutes or so. Almost every store in town was closed on account of the blizzard, and very few cars were parked on the street, but lucky for me, an old favorite stop of mine was still buzzing on: Arrowhead Diner.

I pulled up out front, and Nevada and I pushed past the icy winds and through the glass doors. As we entered, I saw Ted Nielsen still guarding his post behind the counter. He was nearing 60 years old at this point, but no gray showed through his bright ginger hair that sprouted heavily around his face and bald spot. Inside his goatee was his usual cigarette, only matched by a flannel rolled up to the sleeves that sported a longjohn beneath it. Over his jeans sat a greasy white apron tied around his waist, sitting tightly under his beer belly.¬†

He spotted me and cracked a smile, quickly adding his cigarette to his collection in the nearby ashtray. He rounded the counter and gave me a big bear hug.

‚ÄúNate Fischer, how good to see you buddy!‚Äù

‚ÄúAh Ted, it‚Äôs been too long.‚Äù

I embraced him back.

‚ÄúAnd Nevada!‚Äù he chirped in excitement. He picked her up and spun her around before setting her back down. I could tell we all needed the laugh. He went back around the counter and grabbed two mugs, instantly filling them with coffee. He hollered back to the kitchen, his wife working the stoves.

‚ÄúEdna! Two classics on the house!‚Äù

I thanked him for the coffee and stared at the TV hanging from the corner. Over highlights of the Michigan State football game was a banner warning about the weather and a few missing person notices. It seemed peculiar to me; maybe people were really just getting lost in the storm, Martin included. I snapped out of my investigation when Ted spoke.

‚ÄúSo what are you doing here, city slicker? Feeling homesick?‚Äù he joked.

‚ÄúUh no‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if you heard but my stepfather went missing.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah, read it in the newspaper and couldn‚Äôt believe it. Hope Martin‚Äôs okay out there, and your Mom of course. I literally just saw him the day before, life‚Äôs so strange that wa-‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, you saw Martin before he went missing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah he stopped by for lunch, he does that every other Monday.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid he say where he was going?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust said he was going to maybe fish a little and go hunting. I thought he was crazy with this weather starting up.‚Äù

‚ÄúShit. Do you know where he goes?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, there‚Äôs only one lake in town, you know that. But uh, I went hunting with him a few times and usually he likes to go to Carpenter State Park between here and West Branch.‚Äù

A huge lead; maybe I wasn‚Äôt so bad at being a detective after all.¬†

Nevada looked at me with urgency, ‚ÄúWe should go.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre right. Uh, Ted? Thanks for the breakfast offer but we should get back out there.‚Äù

I plopped $50 on the table.¬†

‚ÄúOh alright, Nate‚Ä¶ wait, what‚Äôs this for!?‚Äù

‚ÄúGet you and Edna home and safe alright, get out of this storm.‚Äù

Before he could protest the money, Nevada and I already moved towards the door.

‚ÄúOh my, thanks Nate! You two be careful out there, ya hear!‚Äù he called through the dead diner as the doorbell signaled our exit.

Lucky for me, spending a lot of time around here being a delinquent youth gave me enough knowledge to know my way around, even through the minor visibility. After a while of white noise provided by blustery snowflakes, Nevada spoke to me in a concerned manner.

‚ÄúNate.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh.. yeah, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù	‚ÄúDo you really think we‚Äôre gonna find Martin out here?... In this shit?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo be honest, no. But I promised Mom I‚Äôd at least try so, here we are.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, no, right. I just hope we don‚Äôt get killed in this weather.‚Äù

I nod at her reassuringly and turn back to the road. She looked worried, her eyes darting in small circles like she didn‚Äôt know what to focus on. I‚Äôve seen her stressed of course- through tests in high school to job applications in the city, but worry was a different emotion for her, and something about that set my heart sinking as well. Was I just trying to play the hero? To prove something to myself or her in some desperate act? I wondered if my intentions were selfish, I don‚Äôt really think they were, but I knew either way that there was a lot of responsibility on me now, especially if something happened to Nevada. Pretty much at the point of no return.

We arrive at the lake barely visible by its large sign. The edge of East Bay connecting to our little hamlet was marked by a shoddy gravel parking lot that still managed to crunch under its powdery dress. No other cars were around, so still no sign of Martin. We managed to get out and find the elevated boardwalk that led to the shore because its guard rails poked out of the snow mounds. We held onto them like a connecting rope, slowly pulling ourselves towards the shoreline. When we got there, there was no separation between sand or water, everything was covered and the lake was thoroughly frozen over. There was no car on the shore, and any possible hint of fishing or ice fishing had its evidence destroyed by the frost. As we turned back, the community event board that sat at the entrance was covered in half a dozen missing persons posters. Not only were the people from Arrow Creek, but also the surrounding Houghton Lake and East Bay areas. The newest addition was Martin‚Äôs flier, flapping at the bottom right, still shiny from its industrial print job. Something wasn‚Äôt right here. How have this many people gone missing so close together and so recently? Their dates all came within the start of November till then. There didn‚Äôt seem to be a clear answer devised between either Nevada or I.¬†

While we started our way back to the car, I couldn‚Äôt tell if the fog had grown or not, and it only got more difficult to tell as I had to wipe down my glasses every couple of minutes, Nevada farther ahead and turning back to make sure I didn‚Äôt get buried. We shivered as we started the car, her brown hair glistening with water droplets and my normally jet black hair taking a white sheen.

‚ÄúLooks like we gotta go to the park.‚Äù She joked.

‚ÄúJust like the good old days‚Äù I shot back.

About 20 minutes passed before we crossed the sign signifying that Carpenter State Park was about a mile on our left. I felt relief pass over me as I cruised a little faster through the mist. I felt comfortable at this higher speed until something lurched out of the woods and passed the car. I slammed the breaks and skidded off path, across the rumble strips before pulling myself to a stop on the side of the road. Nevada and I gasped in panic, confused at what had happened.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have no fucking idea‚Äù.

I really didn‚Äôt even know what it was, it blended in with the all white surroundings. I looked around for any sight of it, but saw nothing. Other than something round and black in the uncharted woods about 50 feet out.

‚ÄúNevada, look- I think that‚Äôs a tire out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúMartin‚Äôs car?‚Äù

We got out quickly, but before I did, I made sure to grab my .38 police special revolver I kept in the glove compartments for emergencies. I‚Äôd never used it before, but this felt like the right time for a christening, remembering what my father said. We waddled towards the car, and there it was. Martin‚Äôs no doubt, I recognized his Ford Explorer anywhere, buried in snow, but its red paint contrasting against it. Nevada looked around the car, trying to get inside but there was no sign of Martin. I looked further into the woods, a long stretch of trees that led to a steep, high-standing cliffside that overlooked it. A bright light peeked through a sizable crack in the cliffside, and among it stood two figures. I could barely make them out in the fog or at this distance. They looked like two men, tall and lanky, both bald and standing naked, and blisteringly pale out in the bare elements. Their frame and skin was one thing that didn‚Äôt feel out of the ordinary, but the way they stood and watched from behind the trees without any sort of clothes or uttered noises gave me pause.

I felt a chill not from the snow, and despite my fears, I felt the need to push forward.

‚ÄúKeep an eye on the car‚Äù I said to Nevada who agreed, she had already started breaking into it for a sign of life, or something that would signify what had happened. As I approached the lit crack, the two figures gave ungodly clicking screeches before retreating into the fog and over the cliff. Okay, so definitely not normal. I heard my heavy breathing and my puffy jacket sliding along itself, and something else; something new. A pulsing, wet sound coming from the crack filled with light. It wasn‚Äôt just a crack, but a hole. I tried to look in with not much payoff, and finally decided after feeling around with my arm that I could squeeze myself through.

When I entered this crack I expected a small overhang¬† of rocks, an eroded part of the cliffside that just led out into the other side of the forest, the most reasonable place for the white light to be coming from. But instead I found what I could only reasonably describe as a hive. The whole of the cave was filled with a stretchy white material, like spiderwebs made from polymer, as if the whole thing was carved from erasers. Lining walls were these pods, rows and rows of translucent eggs with.. People. The people who had gone missing, their bodies slowly digesting in one pod and replicas forming in adjacent ones. Some H.R Giger-esque nightmare, I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was seeing. A sick joke? An elaborate prank? That was the least reasonable justification.

One pod was empty however, and sitting at the base of its cracked shell was Martin in his hunting gear, looking frozen and wet.

‚ÄúHoly shit, Martin! Are you okay?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù he said, no inflection or exasperation in his voice. At that moment however, I didn‚Äôt notice.

‚ÄúC‚Äômon, let‚Äôs get you out of here.‚Äù

I grabbed his arm and yanked towards the hole. He pulled away.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?.. Because we‚Äôre in a fucked up nest, Martin!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so nice down here.‚Äù

I stood up quickly and stepped backwards, the white uterus around me squelching underneath my feet. This *thing* wasn‚Äôt Martin, not anymore. He got up and started towards me in a disturbingly calm manner. I backed up more, holding him at distance with the barrel of my .38.¬†

‚ÄúMartin, what are you doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should join us, Nate. It‚Äôs so nice and safe here.‚Äù

I unlatched the safety and cocked the hammer back.

‚ÄúSTOP!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt have to do anything again, let us do everything for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúBACK THE FUCK UP, I‚ÄôM WARNING YOU!‚Äù

‚ÄúGive up control, Nathan. Become a passenger.‚Äù

My back was pushed against the hole.

‚ÄúNowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. Humans can‚Äôt live through the storm inside.‚Äù

He lunged towards me, his face contorting, and without hesitation I fired a round into his forehead.

He slumped over onto the ground, a gross, fleshy film peeled off of him and lurched back towards the other pods.	‚ÄúFUCK‚Äù was all I could muster frustratedly, staring down at his body. I grappled with what just happened, not able to process it as choked sobs left my mouth. My step dad was dead, his real body long gone and whatever had become him slumped over in front of me, looking just like him. I screamed loudly before forcing myself back through the hole and back into the forest. I felt hot tears quickly freeze to my face, and my breaths had become stinging and harsh through my soft crying. To my shock, Nevada was standing by a tree outside the hole. She grabbed me and hugged me for a moment, trying to ask what happened as I mumbled incoherently. A few seconds later she dug into me with her fingers and sternly urged me to quiet down with shushing and a shaky finger to her lip, her gaze turning upwards towards the cliff. I turned around slowly, snow hitting my glasses obscuring the two creatures observing us with tilted heads and clicky groans. I finally had the chance to see what they were.

The one on the left sat perched on a branch like a monkey, its eyes shone like diamonds as they grazed me, bright light springing forth from them, and its mouth, a wide slit running down its face in a twisted, pulled way towards its cheeks. The right one gripped sturdily onto a tree, peering around curiously, its body the same but face different. It had no nose but beaded black eyes that tore into me. Its jaw was splayed in a wide grin, rows of humanoid teeth multiplied and seated in a sickening display, rotting like wood in a shallow bloody pond. Both watched from the height of the fog, their presence feeling ephemeral and ethereal, like they were biblical angels.

¬†I backed up, grabbing Nevada by the hand and slowly guiding us backwards. As the groans turned to shrieks we separated, full on sprinting through the snow the best we could. I tripped once or twice as snow blocked my vision. The second time I looked backwards, our supernatural assailants jumped through the trees and watched with an eager hunt on their faces. Nevada made her way towards me and grabbed my hand.

‚ÄúNate! We gotta fucking GO!‚Äù

We kept moving, stepping up and over the high snows, the falling bluster covering up any evidence that we were there.

Eventually we made it back to our car still on the roadside.

Quickly we dove back in and I raced full speed towards town, the smell of gunpowder polluting the cars air.

‚ÄúWhat happened back there?‚Äù Nevada implored.

‚ÄúMartin he‚Äôs.. He‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúWh- How?! What happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúThose fucking things, Nevada‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúThose things, they took Martin and the other people‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre becoming them‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat, like.. Like clones?‚Äù

‚ÄúI.. I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo.. where was Martin?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlready cloned. I.. I had to kill him- it. It wasn‚Äôt Martin anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúHoly shit, Nate. What the fuck did we get ourselves into.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm so fucking sorry you came with me.‚Äù

She stared blankly off for a moment before grabbing my arm.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not.‚Äù

She just looked at me, her eyes big and I just sadly smirked at her when I glanced over.

We drove the rest of the way in solemn silence. When we got back in, it was way past midnight. I sat up staring at the wall and occasionally checking the windows, while Nevada sat on the shower floor for most of the night. We packed our bags and loaded the SUV through tired eyes in the morning. When I asked Nevada if she found anything in Martin‚Äôs car, she didn‚Äôt turn up any results. No information that was useful to us at the least.

I told my Mom we didn‚Äôt find anything, I didn‚Äôt have the heart to tell her the truth about Martin or anybody else. I said I had to head back to the city for work but that I‚Äôd call her when we got in. I also made sure to give my Dad a hug before I left, asking him to look after Mom and granting him the trust he wanted. We drove through town on our way out, and I had one idea before leaving. I stopped outside the diner to use a payphone. I called the FBI anonymous tip line, telling them approximately where the nest was, implying it was urgent they check it out. They wanted more info but I simply hung up, trying my best to not think about it or attach myself any further.

I couldn‚Äôt get those creatures out of my head, The Pilots as I came to call them. I remembered Martin‚Äôs clone urging me to become a ‚ÄúPassenger‚Äù which makes me wonder if Martin was still in there somewhere. I call them Pilots as they seem to take the host on a trip, one that you can‚Äôt come back from. All you can do is sit back and watch the plane go down, taking others with it. I don‚Äôt know where they came from, and I‚Äôm still not sure if there‚Äôs more somewhere else. I‚Äôve had little time to really think about it at the moment.

Nevada and I were husks as we started away from Arrow Creek. She stared blankly out at the road ahead, too scared to look out the windows and into the forest, and I felt the same hesitation. But as we drove slowly, she kept her hand in mine, and her head laid against my shoulder. Despite everything we saw, maybe the one thing that was still okay was *us*. The silence was a lot less uncomfortable with her next to me. As we took the country roads out of town towards the highway, the wind whistled, and even miles out from town, I really couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that we were being watched.",2,1755891971.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Pretty sure it took me long to write this out than time spent in active labor lol. I like including all the details in case it helps someone else, but also for me to read in the future. 

*TL;DR
Spontaneous water break at 38+4, <90 mins of active labor, 3 contractions and 8 mins of pushing (doc almost didn't make it), unplanned unmedicated birth, mildly traumatizing. Complete opposite from my first pregnancy and birth.*


My pregnancies with both of our girls were complete opposites, so of course it makes sense that my deliveries would be entirely different too. With our oldest, L (July 2024), I had minimal nausea, but the worst food aversions and hella heartburn. K gave me nausea the entire pregnancy, and ER-levels of morning sickness until 21 weeks ü§¢ but no food aversions. I had lots of aches and pains with both girls, but it was next level with K (it took an act of God sometimes just to roll over and get out of bed üòÇ). With L, we had a peaceful, planned induction with an epidural and fairly chill delivery (though she did come out blue with the cord around her neck). K laughed at our plans and made her presence known very boldly and red-faced in an unmedicated rapid L&D. We were scheduled to repeat the similar process that we did for L, and induce on the 8th, but K decided that she wanted to join us sooner. 


My water unexpectedly broke on the evening of the 2nd, at 38+4. I had just gone to pee and come back to the kitchen to grab a snack before going to hang out with L in the playroom. I randomly felt a ""pop"" like I often do when a bunch of discharge is coming, and what felt like discharge, until I moved and felt like I was peeing myself. I recognized that feeling from when my waters were broken with L. I said ""oh shit not now...."" and hustled to the bathroom where my pantyliner was completely soaked. I put on a maxi pad (because I didn't quite believe it yet) and by the time I got back to the kitchen it was soaked again. I went back to the bathroom and put on a diaper with maxi pad in it, and texted my husband that I needed him inside (he was outside doing yardwork and talking to the neighbors). When he got inside, he joked ""what, did your water break?"" üòÇ


After texting my husband, I kinda was in an immediate moment of overwhelming indecision - there was a lot of things that I wanted to get done, but I wasn't sure where to start, and we were now on a clock. Since my contractions were not much different than what I had been having for several weeks already, I went ahead and got in the shower to wash my hair while my husband got the house tided up, L fed, in the bath, and ready for bed. I coordinated a friend coming to stay the night at the house, my MIL coming over to relieve her in the morning, and my sister to start packing and hitting the road to drive down to our place the next day (6 hours away). We made our way to the hospital after getting L settled in bed. The 4 teeth she was cutting and the low-grade fever she had been running for several days made her extra clingy, so we wanted to make sure she got one last set of snuggles as an only child. üíï


At this point I had still been having fairly regular, but manageable contractions, but still nothing too different from what I had been having for the couple weeks prior. I swear K knew what was up though, because after I was triaged, admitted, and put in our room to review the plan for everything, things went from 0-100 very quickly. We went in through the ER, got registered, and then brought up to L&D triage. The triage nurse wanted to check and make sure my waters were actually broken, even though she believed me when I said it felt the same as it did for my first. I jokingly asked her if she wanted to swab me or the floor that I was leaking on. üòÇ The test stick instantly turned the color it does for amniotic fluid and she was like ""ok yep, you're staying!"" She checked me, and I was dilated to about a 3 (where I had been when my OB checked me at my 38 week appt). 


After officially being admitted, my IV got put in, and I was put in my L/D/PP room, and I got settled in the bed with the expectation of a long night. It was around 12:30am. My L&D nurse and I started going over my birth preferences sheet - where I basically had my medical info listed out, as well as how I preferred things to happen for certain circumstances, but was basically ""TL;DR: tell me if/when something needs to happen and why, even if it's something I don't want, and then get me and baby through it safely - I just want to be kept in the loop.""


Around 1am, my nurse had me lay on my side in the bed to get a better reading of baby's HR, and I started giving her the rundown of how my last labor went - specifically with pain medication. With my induction, I went into it with an open mindset of trying different stuff. I told her how we tried IV pain medication, and I felt like that made everything way worse, so I went ahead and got an epidural and had no regrets. I told her I was coming into this labor with the same open mind, but not doing IV pain meds this time. I mentioned that a big concern I had with not getting an epidural was that I didn't want to feel the episiotomy if I needed one again, or the stitches afterwards. She assured me that they can give me lidocaine if that was the case. During this whole process, I am still consistently leaking my waters, with bigger gushes each time I or baby girl changed positions.


Mid-conversation with my nurse, I had to start pausing in my conversation for contractions, as I noticed they were getting more uncomfortable, especially as more of my waters were leaking out. After a couple of minutes, I asked her if she could check me, just to see if these noticeably uncomfortable contractions were even productive. I was at 7cm dilated. She told me that if I did want an epidural that I would need to choose soon, as I was obviously progressing quickly (went from 3-7 basically since the start of our conversation), and I still needed fluids first, but that she thought I could probably go natural if I really wanted to. I was having to really breathe through contractions at this point, and was gripping the bed frame pretty hard, so I wasn't able to give her a clear answer either way. She told me that she was going to go ahead and have anesthesia prep lidocaine stuff and epidural stuff, just in case I decided on one or the other, and that she'd be back to check on me right after.


After her departure, things continued to ramp up. I noticed that my grip on the bed frame was getting tighter and I was pulling it towards me. I started thinking to myself that I couldn't keep doing this, and I was starting to groan through contractions. My husband was watching the monitor and making comments on their strength each time. At some point, I had a clear thought in my head of ""I no longer want to be laying down"" but I couldn't articulate that to my husband and I was hurting too much to move on my own. I pushed the nurse call button, and someone besides my nurse answered, to which I managed to confuse them when I spit out ""I need to move and I don't know how"" in between groaning. I started trying to flop myself off the bed - I'm not sure what my plan was beyond not wanting to lay down anymore. I was going off of pure instinct at that point. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


My nurse comes back in after only having been gone maybe ten minutes, and helps me back onto the bed, where I go on all fours. Someone else came in with her that had a bunch of prep stuff (I saw afterwards it was epidural stuff) and was laying things out as well as prepping the baby warmer. I vaguely remember them coming with her but I didn't really care or notice in the moment with how bad I was hurting. My contractions had gone from the annoying period/back aches that I had been having for weeks, to a radiating pain that started in my uterus and spread outwards into my hips, sides, back, and legs, to that same radiating pain gripping me like a vice and rendering me immobile. When I went on all fours, my nurse angled up the head of the bed upwards and to be easier for me to grab hold of. By this point, I am no longer in control of the noises I'm making. Contractions felt like they were basically on top of each other, and my head was absolutely buried in them. My nurse, the angel that she was, kept reminding me to breathe, and to convert my whines and whimpers to low groans and deep moans. She said to let her know when I felt like I needed to poop, and then asked if I wanted her to check me. I said she could check, that I didn't care, but that baby was coming, all in the same breath. 


In the midst of all of this, I told my husband to get the fan from my bag because I'm hot and sweating so much, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. He dropped it while trying to adjust it where I wanted it (at my face not my back like he did at first), and the front popped off. I'm pretty sure I literally growled at him üòÇ


When I suddenly hit the point of ""she's coming now!"", I was in so much pain, I didn't know or care who was in the room, and I would have sworn to you that my husband and my nurse were gonna be the ones delivering her because of how quickly she was coming. When I told the nurse that she could check me, but that she was coming now, my body starting bearing down (my body said ""YEETUS THE FETUS"" lmao). I couldn't stop it - and it hurt way worse to not push. During all of this, more people showed up and the bed got broken down at some point (I was so in my head that I didn't notice or care). I was no longer pulling on the side bed rail, I was bracing against it with my right arm while gripping my husband's hand with my left hand. Apparently I was bracing pretty hard, because I managed to pop the bed rail off in a way that the nurses didn't know it could üò¨. My husband also told me afterwards that he was pretty sure I had broken his hand during this point (thankfully he had the sense to not say anything in the moment üòÇ).


The contractions feel completely unbearable to me at this point, and felt like they had no break in between them. It was all I could do to try to catch my breath in the few seconds in between them (and I was also trying to fix my ponytail that was holding my hair back - my scrunchie was not the right tool that day lol). This is all while my face is buried in the mattress and I'm gripping the top of the bed frame for dear life (my nurse angling the head of the bed up earlier was the perfect move). Every time I felt it coming on again, I remember whimpering to myself ""oh not again...."" and wanting to cry. In my head I just kept silently calling out to my mom (she passed a few years ago) to help me because I couldn't do it anymore. I held my breath and pushed with my body each time it starting bearing down, and I could feel baby girl moving down. Along with the pain of contractions, it felt like taking the biggest, most constipated shit of my life üò¨üòÇ. Each time I pushed, I bit down on the bedsheets because I felt like I would have cracked my teeth otherwise.


I have no sense of time in all of this, but I remember suddenly smelling coffee, and then another voice chiming in to tell me to breathe because baby needed oxygen. Not long after, I feel everything burning downstairs and I start trying to pull myself up the bed and up the walls away from the pain. The OB says she can help get her out quicker if she turns baby's head with her fingers from the other side by going up my rectum (did not know that was a thing they would try to do üò¨ sharing that TMI bit in case it helps anyone else prepare). I told her to do it, idc, and once she did, I yelped in pain right before her head popped out. I pushed again, and they pulled her the rest of the way out. She was born on Aug 3rd at 2:27am weighing 8lbs 1oz (also a shock since our first was 6lbs 8oz). I clung to the top of the bed for dear life while I caught my breath and processed what just happened.


They helped me turn around, where a room full of people had assembled in the last few minutes. Apparently, the OB showed up just in time (smelling like coffee - it was the middle of the night after all), only a few minutes before she was born - my nurse told me after that she showed up during the second contraction of pushing, and there was only three contractions worth of pushing (about 8 mins total üò≥). After I'm turned around and sitting, I feel the urge to ""poop"" again, which was my body wanting the placenta out.


I had told my nurse beforehand that I wanted my husband to do the first skin to skin like he did with our first. So after he cut baby girl's cord, they took her to the warmer, then brought her to him for skin to skin. I had started shaking so bad during this that I'm glad she wasn't on me yet. I never had the shakes with my first, so I didn't know how long they were going to last, but I'm assuming all the adrenaline from the rapid build-up and birth made them way worse. They ended up lasting about 30-40 mins after birth.


Even with the lidocaine, I could still feel the stitches, but they weren't awful. The OB said I tore about halfway down my old episiotomy scar where the skin was weakened. 


After getting stitched up, they had us do skin to skin, and golden hour type stuff. When my nurse came back to help me to the bathroom and to clean up/change ny bed linens, she also had everything prepped for me in the bathroom, including warm water in my peri bottle (bless). With my first, it burned to pee (like a UTI) for several days after birth, so that's what I was expecting this time too. When it didn't burn, it dawned on me that it was because I didn't have a catheter this time since I didn't have an epidural. I took a shower while she cleaned up my bed, and it felt amazing to wash off all the sweat and fluids and blood, even though the shower itself sucked üòÇ it's amazing how much more human and normal I felt at that point. It was also very surreal - like did that really just happen? I honestly felt a bit in shock.


I'm still in mild disbelief that she's here, and at how she actually arrived, but so happy that she's earthside and providing amazing snuggles üíï I went into this birth with an open mind and plan, but I was not planning or preparing to go unmedicated. Even though I had read about all the stages and how you know when you're in transition and such, I still got lost in my head and in the pain. So glad my nurse was able to ground me a bit and coach me through it, because I don't know how I would have otherwise. On one hand, I'm glad that the worst of labor and the pain went so quickly, but on the other hand, I'm mildly traumatized by how quickly things progressed and how feral and out of control things felt in the moment. I'm normally pretty decent at processing and managing pain, but I feel like with this that I never had time to get my head around it.


Healing wise, I feel like my outward appearance went back to normal pretty quickly. This pregnancy gave me more aches and pains though, and I still have lots of stiffness and aches in my joints, specifically my hips and pelvis. My ribs are still pretty achy, and weirdly enough, I have to let my feet ""warm up"" before I can walk normally in the morning - they don't want to bend at first. Bleeding has mostly stopped at 2 weeks PP, but it still comes and goes if I overdo it. My poor hemmeroids never really recovered after L's birth, then got bad from the zofran constipation of this pregnancy, then got aggravated again during this birth. They're better now, but will likely never fully go away ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. My entire body felt sore for about a week - kinda like when you go too hard at the gym and you overworked some muscles, but like my entire body. My back muscles were especially tired and sore.

1mxgbqy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxgbqy,Plan help needed! (I'm going crazy! lol),"We bought a house and unexpectedly have to remodel the kitchen due to water damage (ugh!!!). Anyways, now I'm going crazy trying to design this new kitchen. There's no formal dining room so we have to fit a table in one end of the space. Lookswise this is the aesthetic of the cabinets we're going for (white oak lowers, white uppers).

Here's where I'm stumped:  
\-Get rid of the microwave over the oven! But then where to put it...the cabinet company only has the 30"" lower microwave cabinet. This would be the least visually interupting place to put it (far left of oven wall). I'd love to have it full out of sight, but a huge pantry to the right of the fridge pushes everything way to far to the left. Am I missing any other possibilities? (btw that's just a filler hood, prob will do wood) 

\-Pull out trash is on the small L to the right of the wallway doorway so that it's accessible to the sink and fridge. I don't want to put the microwave there.

\-Currently the fridge is next to a wall and already banged up from hitting it (\*facepalm\*). It's a 36"" so in the new plans I scaled it down to a 33"" (we have a garage fridge right outside the hallway if you look at the floor plan). I know going with a smaller fridge is probably not typical but more counter space and cabinetry feels preferable. It's just 2 of us for now. Anyways-moved it over a little bit so that it's not in the walkway threshold anymore and cant hit the wall. Good idea? Bad idea?

\-Re fridge above\^: two plan options with a 18"" pantry cabinet or an 18"" counter and cabinets for a landing space and out of the way appliances (coffee per chance?). Which is better?

\-Sink side- still haven't gotten the cabinetry right for the uppers! The before has no shelves on the right and it's really unbalanced. Extending the counter a little bit further so it's a little more than halfway between the windows.

\-Lopsided- one wall is quite a bit longer than the other side so that the dining table can fit...hopefully that's not going to be too strange. Does the rough draft look okay?

¬† Better to see dead than be dead.  
  
¬† ‚ÄîCHARLOTTE JEAN DAVIDSON, GRIM REAPER  
  
¬† I‚Äôd been having the same dream for the past month‚Äîthe one where a dark stranger materialized out of smoke and shadows to play doctor with me. I was starting to wonder if repetitive exposure to nightly hallucinations resulting in earth-shattering climaxes could have any long-term side effects. Death via extreme pleasure was a serious concern. The prospect led to the following dilemma: Do I seek help or buy drinks all around?  
  
¬† This night was no exception. I was having a killer dream that featured a set of capable hands, a hot mouth, and a creative employment of lederhosen when two external forces tried to lure me out of it. I did my darnedest to resist, but they were fairly persistent external forces. First, a frosty chill crept up my ankle, the icy caress jolting me out of my red-hot dream. I shivered and kicked out, unwilling to acknowledge the summons, then tucked my leg into the thick folds of my Bugs Bunny comforter.  
  
¬† Second, a soft but persistent melody played in the periphery of my consciousness like a familiar song I couldn‚Äôt quite place. After a moment, I realized it was the cricketlike chime of my new phone.  
  
¬† With a heavy sigh, I pried open my eyes just enough to focus on the numbers glowing atop my nightstand. It was 4:34 A.M. What kind of sadist called another human being at 4:34 in the morning?  
  
¬† A throat cleared at the foot of my bed. I turned my attention to the dead guy standing there, then lowered my lids and asked in a gravelly voice, ‚ÄúCan you get that?‚Äù  
  
¬† He hesitated. ‚ÄúUm, the phone?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMmm.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm kind of‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNever mind.‚Äù I reached for the phone and grimaced as a jolt of pain ripped through me, reminding me I‚Äôd been beaten senseless the night before.  
  
¬† Dead Guy cleared his throat again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù I croaked.  
  
¬† It was my uncle Bob. He bombarded me with words, of all things, apparently clueless to the fact that predawn hours rendered me incapable of coherent thought. I concentrated super duper hard on concentrating and made out three salient phrases: busy night, two homicides, ass down here. I even managed a reply, something resembling, ‚ÄúWhat twirly nugget are you from?‚Äù  
  
¬† He sighed, clearly annoyed, then hung up.  
  
¬† I hung up back, pressing a button on my new phone that either disconnected the call or speed-dialed the Chinese takeout around the corner. Then I tried to sit up. Similar to the coherent-thought problem, this was easier said than done. While I normally weighed around 125 ‚Ä¶ ish, for some unexplainable reason, between the hours of partially awake and fully awake, I weighed a solid 470.  
  
¬† After a brief, beached whale‚Äìlike struggle, I gave up. The quart of Chunky Monkey I ate after getting my ass kicked had probably been a bad idea.  
  
¬† In too much pain to stretch, I let a lengthy yawn overtake me instead, winced at the soreness shooting through my jaw, then looked back at Dead Guy. He was blurry. Not because he was dead, but because it was 4:34 A.M. And I‚Äôd recently had my ass kicked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù he said nervously. He had a wrinkled suit, round-rimmed glasses, and mussed hair that made him look part young-wizard-we-all-know-and-love and part mad scientist. He also had two bullet holes on the side of his head with blood streaking down his right temple and cheek. None of these details were a problem. The problem resided in the fact that he was in my bedroom. In the wee hours of dawn. Standing over me like a dead Peeping Tom.  
  
¬† I eyed him with my infamous death stare, second only to my infamous fluster stare, and got a response immediately.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry, sorry,‚Äù he said, stumbling over his words, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt mean to frighten you.‚Äù  
  
¬† Did I look frightened? Clearly my death stare needed work.  
  
¬† Ignoring him, I inched out of bed. I had on a Scorpions hockey jersey I‚Äôd snatched off a goalie and a pair of plaid boxers‚Äîsame team, different position. Chihuahuas, tequila, and strip poker. A night that is forever etched at the top of my Things I‚Äôll Never Do Again list.  
  
¬† With teeth clenched in agony, I dragged all 470 throbbing pounds toward the kitchen and, more important, the coffeepot. Caffeine would chisel the pounds off, and I‚Äôd be back to my normal weight in no time.  
  
¬† Because my apartment was roughly the size of a Cheez-It, it didn‚Äôt take me long to feel my way to the kitchen in the dark. Dead Guy followed me. They always follow me. I could only pray this one would keep his mouth shut long enough for the caffeine to kick in, but alas, no such luck.  
  
¬† I‚Äôd barely pressed the ON button when he st  
arted in.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUm, yeah,‚Äù he said from the doorway, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just that I was murdered yesterday, and I was told you were the one to see.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou were told that, huh?‚Äù Maybe if I hovered over the pot, it would develop an inferiority complex and brew faster just to prove it could.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis kid told me you solve crimes.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe did, huh?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Charley Davidson, right?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you a cop?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot especially.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA sheriff‚Äôs deputy?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh-uh.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA meter maid?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù I said, turning to him at last, ‚Äúno offense, but you could have died thirty years ago, for all I know. Dead people have no sense of time. Zero. Zip. Nada.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYesterday, October eighteenth, five thirty-two P.M., double gunshot wound to the head, resulting in traumatic brain injury and death.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said, reining in my skepticism. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not a cop.‚Äù I turned back to the pot, determined to break its iron will with my infamous death stare, second only to‚Äî  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo, then, what are you?‚Äù  
  
¬† I wondered if your worst nightmare would sound silly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a private investigator. I hunt down adulterers and lost dogs. I do not solve murder cases.‚Äù I did, actually, but he didn‚Äôt need to know that. I‚Äôd just come off a big case. I was hoping for a few days‚Äô respite.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut this kid‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAngel,‚Äù I said, disappointed that I didn‚Äôt exorcise that little devil when I had the chance.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe was an angel?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, his name is Angel.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHis name is Angel?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes. Why?‚Äù I asked, becoming disenchanted with the Angel game.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI just thought it might have been his occupation.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs his name. And believe you me, he is anything but.‚Äù  
  
¬† After a geological epoch passed in which single-celled organisms evolved into talk show hosts, Mr. Coffee was still holding out on me. I gave up and decided to pee instead.  
  
¬† Dead Guy followed me. They always‚Äî  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very ‚Ä¶ bright,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUm, thanks.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd ‚Ä¶ sparkly.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh-huh.‚Äù This was nothing new. From what I‚Äôd been told, the departed see me as something of a beacon, a brilliant entity‚Äîemphasis on the brilliant‚Äîthey can see from continents away. The closer they get, the sparklier I become. If sparklier is a word. I‚Äôve always considered the sparkles a plus of being the only grim reaper this side of Mars. And as such, my job was to lead people into the light. Aka, the portal. Aka, me. But it didn‚Äôt always go smoothly. Kind of like leading a horse to water and whatnot. ‚ÄúBy the way,‚Äù I said, glancing over my shoulder, ‚Äúif you do see an angel, a real one, run. Quickly. In the opposite direction.‚Äù Not really, but freaking people out was fun.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSeriously. Hey‚Äî‚Äù I stopped and twirled to face him. ‚Äú‚Äîdid you touch me?‚Äù Somebody practically molested my right ankle, somebody cold, and since he‚Äôd been the only dead guy in the room ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he said, indignant.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEarlier, when I was in bed.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPffft, no.‚Äù  
  
¬† I narrowed my eyes, let my gaze linger menacingly, then resumed my hobble to the bathroom.  
  
¬† I needed a shower. Bad. And I couldn‚Äôt dillydally all day. Uncle Bob would stroke.  
  
¬† But as I stepped toward the bathroom, I realized the worst part of my morning‚Äîthe let there be light part‚Äîwas fast approaching. I groaned and considered dillydallying despite the state of Uncle Bob‚Äôs arteries.  
  
¬† Just suck it up, I told myself. It had to be done.  
  
¬† I placed a shaky hand on the wall, held my breath, and flipped the switch.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm blind!‚Äù I yelled, shielding my eyes with my arms. I tried to focus on the floor, the sink, the Clorox ToiletWand. Nothing but a bright white blur.  
  
¬† I totally needed to lower my wattage.  
  
¬† I stumbled back, caught myself, then forced one foot in front of the other, refusing to back down. I would not be stopped by a lightbulb. I had a job to do, dammit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you know you have a dead guy in your living room?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† I turned back to the dead guy, then glanced across the room to where Mr. Wong stood, his back to us, his nose buried in the corner. Looking back at dead guy number one, I asked, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that a bit like the pot calling the kettle African-American?‚Äù  
  
¬† Mr. Wong was a dead guy, too. A teeny-tiny one. He couldn‚Äôt have been more than five feet tall, and he was gray‚Äîall of him, almost monochrome in his translucence, with a gray uniform of some sort and ash gray hair and skin. He looked like a Chinese prisoner of war. And he stood in my corner day after day, year after year. Never moving, never speaking. Though I could hardly blame him for not getting out more with his coloring and all, even I thought Mr. Wong was a nut job.  
  
¬† Of course, the mere fact that I had a ghost in the corner wasn‚Äôt the creepiest part, and the moment Dead Guy realized Mr. Wong wasn‚Äôt actually standing in the corner, but was hovering, toes several inches from the floor, he‚Äôd freak.  
  
¬† I lived for such moments.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood morning, Mr. Wong!‚Äù I semi-shouted. I wasn‚Äôt sure if Mr. Wong could hear. Probably a good thing, since I had no idea what his real name was. I just named him Mr. Wong in the interim between creepy dead guy in the corner and normal walking-around dead guy he would someday become if I had anything to say about it. Even dead people needed a healthy sense of well-being.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs he in time-out?‚Äù  
  
¬† Good question. ‚ÄúI have no idea why he‚Äôs in that corner. Been there since I rented the apartment.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou rented the apartment with a dead guy in the corner?‚Äù  
  
¬† I shrugged. ‚ÄúI wanted the apartment, and I figured I could cover him up with a bookcase or something. But the thought of having a dead guy hovering behind my copy of Sweet Savage Love gnawed at me. I couldn‚Äôt just leave him there. I don‚Äôt even know if he likes romance.‚Äù  
  
¬† I looked back at the newest incorporeal being to grace me with his presence. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name, anyway?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, how rude of me,‚Äù he said, straightening and walking forward for a handshake. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Patrick. Patrick Sussman. The Third.‚Äù He stopped short and eyed his hand, then glanced back up sheepishly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt guess we can actually‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† I took his hand in a firm shake. ‚ÄúActually, Patrick, Patrick Sussman the Third, we can.‚Äù  
  
¬† His brows drew together. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, well,‚Äù I said, going into the bathroom, ‚Äújoin the club.‚Äù  
  
¬† As I closed the door, I heard Patrick Sussman III freak out at last.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, my god. He‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶ hovering.‚Äù  
  
¬† It‚Äôs the simple things in life, and all that crap.  
  
¬† \* \* \*  
  
¬† The shower felt like heaven covered in warm chocolate syrup. Steam and water rushed over me as I inventoried each muscle, adding a mental asterisk if it ached.  
  
¬† My left biceps definitely needed an asterisk, which made sense. The asshole in the bar last night wrenched my arm with the apparent intention of ripping it off. Sometimes being a private investigator meant dealing with society‚Äôs less-than-savory characters, like a client‚Äôs abusive husband.  
  
¬† Next, I checked my entire right side. Yep, it ached. Asterisk. Probably happened when I fell against the jukebox. Stealth and grace, I ain‚Äôt.  
  
¬† Left hip, asterisk. No idea.  
  
¬† Left forearm, double asterisks. Most likely when I blocked asshole‚Äôs punch.  
  
¬† And then, of course, my left cheek and jaw, quadruple asterisks, where my block proved utterly useless. Asshole was simply too strong and too fast, and the punch had been too unexpected. I went down like a drunken cowgirl trying to line dance to Metallica.  
  
¬† Embarrassing? Yes. But strangely enlightening as well. I‚Äôd never been KO‚Äôd before. I thought it would hurt more. Somehow, when you‚Äôre knocked senseless, the pain doesn‚Äôt show  
up till later. Then it‚Äôs a cold, heartless bitch.  
  
¬† Still, I‚Äôd made it through the night with no permanent damage. Always a good thing.  
  
¬† As I tried to work some of the soreness out of my neck, my thoughts turned to the dream I‚Äôd had, the same dream I‚Äôd been having every night for a month. And it was proving harder and harder to vanquish the remnants after I woke, the lingering touches, the fog of hunger. Every night in my dreams, a man appeared from the darkest recesses of my mind, as if he‚Äôd been waiting for me to fall asleep. His mouth, full, masculine, would sear my flesh. His tongue, like flames across my skin, would send tiny sparks quaking through my body. Then he would dip south, and the heavens would open and a chorus singing hallelujah would ring out in perfect harmony.  
  
¬† At first the dreams started small. A touch. A kiss light as air. A smile I could see only in the periphery of negative space, finding beauty where I‚Äôd never expected. Then the dreams developed, became stronger and frighteningly intense. For the first time in my life, I‚Äôd actually climaxed in my sleep. And not just once. In the last month, I‚Äôd come often, on more nights than not, in fact. All at the hands‚Äîand other body parts‚Äîof a dream lover I couldn‚Äôt see, not fully. Yet I knew he was the epitome of sensuality, of male magnetism and allure. And I knew also that he reminded me of someone.  
  
¬† I figured my dreams were being invaded, but by whom? I‚Äôve had the ability to see the departed all my life. I had been born a grim reaper, after all. The grim reaper, though I didn‚Äôt discover that little jewel until I was in high school. Even so, the departed have never been able to enter my dreams, to make me quake and quiver and, I admit, beg.  
  
¬† As far as my ability goes, there‚Äôs nothing particularly special about it. The departed exist on one plane, and the human race exists on another, and somehow‚Äîwhether by freak accident, divine intervention, or psychological disorder‚ÄîI exist on both. A perk, I suppose, of grim reaperism. But it‚Äôs all quite simple. No trances. No crystal balls. No channel surfing the dead from one plane to the next. Just a girl, a few ghosts, and the entire human race. What could be easier?  
  
¬† And yet, he was something more, something ‚Ä¶ not dead. At least he seemed that way. The person in my dreams radiated heat. Dead people are cold, just like in the movies. Their presence will fog your breath, make you shiver, stand your hair on end. But the man in my dreams, the dark, seductive stranger I‚Äôd become addicted to, was a furnace. He was like the scalding water rushing over me, sensual and painful and everywhere at once.

¬† And the dreams were so real, the feelings and responses his touch evoked so vivid. I could almost feel him now, his hands sliding up my thighs, as if he were in the shower with me at that very moment. I could feel his palms rest on my hips and the length of his hard body press against my backside. I reached behind me, ran my fingers along his steel buttocks as he pulled me onto him. His muscles contracted and released underneath my touch, like the tide‚Äôs flow and ebb under the sway of the moon. When I forced a hand between us, slid it down his abdomen to encircle his erection, he hissed in a breath of pleasure and hugged me to him.  
  
¬† I felt his mouth at my ear, his breath fan over my cheek. We had never spoken. The heat and intensity of the dreams left little room for conversation.  
  
¬† But for the first time, I heard a whispered utterance, faint and almost imperceptible. ‚ÄúDutch.‚Äù  
  
¬† My heartbeats skyrocketed, and I jerked to attention, glancing around the shower, searching for ghosts in cracks and crevices. Nothing. Had I fallen asleep? In the shower? I couldn‚Äôt have. I was still standing. Barely. I clutched the shower valves to keep myself upright, wondering what in the crazy afterlife had just happened.  
  
¬† After steadying myself, I turned off the water and grabbed a towel. Dutch. I‚Äôd distinctly heard the word Dutch.  
  
¬† Only one person on Earth had ever called me Dutch, once, a very long time ago.  
  
¬† Chapter Two  
  
¬† So many dead people, so little time.  
  
¬† ‚ÄîCHARLOTTE JEAN DAVIDSON  
  
¬† Still reeling from the potential identity of Dream Guy, I wrapped myself in the towel and slid open the shower curtain. Sussman poked his head through the door, and my heart took a belly dive into the shallow end of shock, cutting itself on the jagged nerve endings there.  
  
¬† I jumped, then placed a calming hand over my heart, annoyed that I was still so easily surprised. As many times as I‚Äôve seen dead people appear out of nowhere, you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be used to it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHoly crap, Sussman. I wish you guys would learn to knock.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIncorporeal being,‚Äù he said, giving attitude.  
  
¬† I stepped out of the shower and grabbed a squirt bottle from my vanity. ‚ÄúYou set one foot in this bathroom, and I will melt your face with my transcendental pest repellent.‚Äù  
  
¬† His eyes widened. ‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, my shoulders deflating. I had a really hard time lying to the departed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just water. But don‚Äôt tell Mr. Habersham, the dead guy in 2B. This bottle is the only thing that keeps that dirty old man out of my bathroom.‚Äù  
  
¬† Sussman‚Äôs brows arched as he scanned my lack of attire. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt say that I blame him.‚Äù  
  
¬† I glowered and swung open the door, pulling it through his face and disorienting him. He put one hand on his forehead and one on the doorjamb to ride out the dizzy spell. Newbies were so easy. After giving him a second to get his bearings, I pointed to the sign tacked on the outside of my bathroom door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMemorize it,‚Äù I ordered, then slammed the door shut again.  
  
¬† ‚Äú ‚ÄòNo dead people beyond this door,‚Äô ‚Äù he read aloud from beyond the door. ‚Äú ‚ÄòAnd, yes, if you suddenly have the ability to walk through walls, you‚Äôre dead. You‚Äôre not lying somewhere in a drainage ditch waiting to wake up. Get over it, and stay the hell out of my bathroom.‚Äô ‚Äù He stuck his head through the door again. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bit harsh, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù  
  
¬† My sign may have seemed a tad brutal to the untrained eye, but it usually got my message across. Unless it was Mr. Habersham. Him I had to threaten. Often.  
  
¬† Even with the sign, I tended to wash my hair as if the apartment were on fire. Dead people standing in the shower with me after the rinse cycle was a bit much. You‚Äôre never quite the same after a shotgun-blast-to-the-head pops in for tea and a sauna.  
  
¬† I pointed a sharp index finger. ‚ÄúOut!‚Äù I ordered, then turned back to the quandary that was my bruised and swollen face.  
  
¬† Applying foundation after you‚Äôve been knocked on your ass was more of an art than a science. It required patience. And layers. But after the third layer, I ran out of patience and washed my face of the whole matter. Seriously, who was going to see me this early in the morning? By the time I pulled my chocolate brown hair into a ponytail, I almost had myself convinced that bruises and black eyes added a certain je ne sais quoi to my appearance. A little concealer, a little lipstick, and voil√†, I was ready for the world. The question remained, however, Was the world ready for me?  
  
¬† I stepped out of the bathroom in a plain white button-down and jeans, hoping the generous expanse of bosom I carried would help me achieve a solid 9.2 on a scale of 10. I had breasts aplenty. Just in case, I undid the top button to show more cleavage. Maybe no one would notice the fact that my face resembled a topographical map of North America.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWow,‚Äù Sussman said, ‚Äúyou look hot even with the slight disfigurement.‚Äù  
  
¬† I stopped and turned toward him. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUm, you look hot?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet me ask you something,‚Äù I said, easing closer. He took a wary step back. ‚ÄúWhen you were alive, like, five minutes ago, would you have told some chick you‚Äôd just met that she looked hot?‚Äù  
  
¬† He thought about that a moment, then answered, ‚ÄúNo. My wife would divorce me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen why is it the moment you guys die, you think you can say whatever you want to whomever you want?‚Äù  
  
¬† He thought about that a moment, too. ‚ÄúBecause my wife can‚Äôt hear me?‚Äù he offered.  
  
¬† I stabbed him with the full power of my death stare, likely blinding him for all eternity. Then I grabbed my handbag and keys. Just before I shut off the lights, I turned back and said with a wink, ‚ÄúThanks for the compliment.‚Äù  
  
¬† He smiled and followed me out the door.  
  
¬† \* \* \*  
  
¬† Apparently, I wasn‚Äôt as hot as Sussman thought. I was freezing, in fact. And, naturally, I‚Äôd forgotten my jacket. Too lazy to go back for it, I hurried into my cherry red Jeep Wrangler. Her name was Misery, in homage to the master of horror and all things creepy. Sussman oozed into the passenger‚Äôs seat.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe grim reaper, huh?‚Äù he asked as I clicked my seat belt.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYep.‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt realized he knew my job title. He and Angel must have had quite the talk. I turned the key, and Misery purred to life around me. Thirty-seven more payments, and this baby was all mine.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look like the grim reaper.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve met him, have you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, no, not really,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy robe‚Äôs at the cleaners.‚Äù  
  
¬† That got a sheepish chuckle. ‚ÄúAnd your scythe?‚Äù  
  
¬† I shot him an evil grin and turned on the heater. ‚ÄúSpeaking of crimes,‚Äù I said, changing the subject, ‚Äúdid you happen to see the shooter?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNeither hide nor hair.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo ‚Ä¶ no.‚Äù  
  
¬† He slid his glasses up with an index finger. ‚ÄúNo. I didn‚Äôt see anyone.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDarn. That doesn‚Äôt help.‚Äù I turned left onto Central. ‚ÄúDo you know where you are? Where your body is? We‚Äôre headed downtown. This might be you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, I had just pulled into my drive. My wife and I live in the Heights.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre married?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFive years,‚Äù he said, a sadness permeating his voice. ‚ÄúTwo kids. Girls. Four and eighteen months.‚Äù  
  
¬† I hated that part. The people-left-behind part. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù  
  
¬† He looked at me with that expression, that you-can-see-dead-people-so-you-must-have-all-the-answers expression of so many who‚Äôd come before him. He was about to be very disappointed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be hard on them, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù he asked, surprising me with the direction of his thoughts.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, it will be,‚Äù I answered honestly. ‚ÄúAnd your wife will scream and cry and go through a depression from hell. Then she‚Äôll find a strength she never knew she had.‚Äù I looked directly at him. ‚ÄúAnd she‚Äôll live. For the girls, she‚Äôll live.‚Äù  
  
¬† That seemed to satisfy him for the moment. He nodded and stared out the window. We drove the rest of the wa  
y downtown in silence, which gave me unwanted time to think about dream lover. If I was right, his name was Reyes. I had no idea if Reyes was his last name or his first, or where he was from, or where he was now, or any other thing about him, for that matter. But I knew his name was Reyes, and I knew he was beautiful. Unfortunately, he was also dangerous. The one and only time I‚Äôd met him was years ago, when we were both in our teens. Our one encounter was full of threats and tension and skin and his lips so close to mine, I could almost taste him. I never saw him again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere it is,‚Äù Sussman said, dragging me from my thoughts.  
  
¬† He‚Äôd spotted the crime scene several blocks away. Red and blue lights undulated along buildings, pulsing through the pitch black morning. As we drove closer, the bright spotlights set up for the investigators lit up half a city block. It looked like the sun had risen in that one spot alone. I saw Uncle Bob‚Äôs SUV and pulled into a hotel parking lot nearby.  
  
¬† Before we got out, I turned to Sussman. ‚ÄúHey, you didn‚Äôt happen to see anyone in my apartment, did you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou mean, besides Mr. Wong?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah. You know, like, a guy?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. Was somebody else there?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNah, forget it.‚Äù  
  
¬† I had yet to figure out how Reyes did the magic shower trick. Unless I had the uncanny ability to sleep standing up, he could do more than just enter my dreams.  
  
¬† After I got out‚Äîand Sussman more or less fell out‚ÄîI looked for Uncle Bob. He stood about forty yards away, a spotlight casting an eerie glow around him as he gave me the evil eye. He‚Äôs not even Italian. I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs legal.  
  
¬† Uncle Bob, or Ubie as I liked to call him‚Äîthough rarely to his face‚Äîis my dad‚Äôs brother and a detective for the Albuquerque Police Department. I guess he got a life sentence, because my dad was a cop, too, but he retired years ago and bought a bar on Central. My apartment building sits directly behind it. I make a little extra cash occasionally tending bar for him, which brings my current job count to 3.7. I‚Äôm a private investigator when I have clients, a bartender when my dad needs me, and technically, I‚Äôm on the APD payroll as well. On paper, I‚Äôm a consultant. Probably because it sounds important. In real life, I‚Äôm the secret to Uncle Bob‚Äôs success, just as I was for my dad when he worked APD. My ability rocketed them through promotion after promotion until they both became detectives. It‚Äôs amazing how easy it is to solve crimes when you can ask the victims who did it.  
  
¬† The .7 stemmed from my illustrious career as the grim reaper. While it does take up a significant amount of my time, I never profit from that part of my life. So, I‚Äôm still undecided as to whether or not I should call it a job.  
  
¬† We walked under the police tape at exactly five thirtyish. Uncle Bob was livid but surprisingly stroke-free.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost six,‚Äù he said, tapping his watch.  
  
¬† That‚Äôd teach me.  
  
¬† He wore the same brown suit as the day before, but his jaw was clean shaved, his mustache neatly combed, and he smelled like medium-priced cologne. He pinched my chin and maneuvered my face to get a good look at the bruises.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much closer to five thirty,‚Äù I argued.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI called you over an hour ago. And you need to learn to duck.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou called me at four thirty-four,‚Äù I said, swiping at his hand. ‚ÄúI hate four thirty-four. I think four thirty-four should be banned and replaced with something more reasonable, like, say, nine twelve.‚Äù  
  
¬† Uncle Bob released a long breath and popped the rubber band at his wrist. He‚Äôd told me it was part of his anger management program, but how the infliction of pain could possibly help control anger was beyond me. Still, I was always willing to help a surly relative in need.  
  
¬† I leaned into him. ‚ÄúI could Taser you if you think it‚Äôll help.‚Äù  
  
¬† He slid me the evil eye again, but he did it with a grin, and that made me happy.  
  
¬† Apparently, the supervisor for the Office of the Medical Investigator had already done his part, so we could walk onto the crime scene. As we did, I ignored the plethora of sideways glances directed my way. The other officers have never understood how I do what I do, how I solve cases so fast, and they look at me with wary suspicion. I guess I can‚Äôt blame them. Wait a minute. Yes, I can.  
  
¬† Just then I noticed Garrett Swopes, aka pain-in-the-ass skiptracer, standing over the body. I rolled my eyes so far back into my head, I almost seized. Not that Garrett wasn‚Äôt good at his job. He‚Äôd studied under the legendary Frank M. Ahearn, probably the most famous skiptracer in the world. From what I‚Äôd heard, thanks to Mr. Ahearn, Garrett could find Hoffa if he put his mind to it.  
  
¬† He was also easy on the retinas. He had short black hair, wide shoulders, skin like Mayan chocolate, and smoky gray eyes that could capture a girl‚Äôs soul if she stared into them long enough.  
  
¬† Thank God I had the attention span of a gnat.  
  
¬† If I had to guess, I would say he was only half African-American. The lighter skin tone and gray eyes screamed hybrid. I just didn‚Äôt know if his other half was Latino or Anglo. Either way, he had a confident walk and easy smile that turned heads wherever we went. So, looks were certainly not an area he needed to work on.  
  
¬† No, Garrett was a consummate pain in the ass for other reasons. As I stepped into the light, he looked at the bruises on my jaw and smirked. ‚ÄúBlind date?‚Äù  
  
¬† I did that thing where you scratch your eyebrow and flip someone off at the same time. I‚Äôm good at multitasking like that. Garrett just smirked. Again.  
  
¬† Okay, it wasn‚Äôt his fault he was an ass. He used to like me until Uncle Bob, in a drunken stupor, told him our little secret. Naturally, he didn‚Äôt believe a word of it. Who would? That was about a month ago, and our friendship took a nosedive from barely there to nonexistent. He‚Äôs pretty much slotted me for the loony bin. And Uncle Bob, too, for believing I can actually see the departed. Some people have no imagination.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here, Swopes?‚Äù I asked, a little more than annoyed that I had to deal with him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI thought this might be one of my skips.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot unless meth heads wear three-piece suits and fifteen-hundred-dollar Crisci loafers.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs too bad. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs much easier to collect your fee when the skip is dead.‚Äù  
  
¬† Garrett shrugged, semi-agreeing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù Uncle Bob said, ‚ÄúI asked him to stick around, you know, for an extra set of eyes.‚Äù  
  
¬† I was doing my darnedest to keep my own eyes off the body‚Äîdead people I could handle, dead bodies not so much‚Äîbut a movement in my periphery had me zeroing in on that very thing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo, are you getting anything?‚Äù Uncle Bob asked‚Äîhe still thinks I‚Äôm psychic‚Äîbut I was too busy staring at the dead guy in the dead body to answer.  
  
¬† I inched over and nudged the body with my foot. ‚ÄúDude, what are you still doing in there?‚Äù  
  
¬† The dead guy looked at me with wide eyes. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt move my legs.‚Äù  
  
¬† I snorted. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt move your arms either, or your feet or your freaking eyelids. You‚Äôre dead.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJesus H.,‚Äù Garrett said through clenched teeth.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLook.‚Äù I turned to face him head-on. ‚ÄúYou play on your side of the sandbox, and I‚Äôll play on mine. Comprende?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not dead.‚Äù  
  
¬† I turned back. ‚ÄúHon, you‚Äôre as dead as my great-aunt Lillian, and trust me, that woman is now in a perpetual state of decomposition.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm not dead. Why isn‚Äôt anyone trying to revive me?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUm, because you‚Äôre dead?‚Äù  
  
¬† I heard Garrett mutter something under his breath, then stalk off. Nonbelievers were such drama queens.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay, fine, if I‚Äôm dead, how am I talking to you? And why are you so sparkly?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long story. Just trust me, mister, you‚Äôre dead.‚Äù  
  
¬† Just then, Sergeant Dwight walked up, all crisp and formal looking in his APD uniform and military buzz. ‚ÄúMs. Davidson, did you just kick that dead body?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFor heavenÔøΩ  
ÔøΩÔøΩs sake, I‚Äôm not dead!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  
  
¬† Sergeant Dwight tried his hand at a death stare. I tried not to giggle.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI got this, Sergeant,‚Äù Uncle Bob said.  
  
¬† The sarge turned to him, and they eyed each other a full minute before he spoke. ‚ÄúWould you mind not contaminating my crime scene with your relatives?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour crime scene?‚Äù Uncle Bob asked. A vein in his temple started pulsing.  
  
¬† I considered popping the rubber band at his wrist, but I still had doubts as to its efficacy. ‚ÄúHey, Uncle Bob,‚Äù I said, patting his arm, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go over here and talk, shall we?‚Äù  
  
¬† I turned and left without waiting, hoping Uncle Bob would follow. He did. We strolled past the spotlights to a tree and assumed innocuous conversational positions. I tossed a smile to Sergeant Dwight Yokel that leaned heavily toward smart-ass. I think he growled. Good thing I wasn‚Äôt into people-pleasing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell?‚Äù Uncle Bob asked as Garrett reluctantly rejoined us.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. He won‚Äôt get out of his body.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe what?‚Äù Garrett raked a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúThis is classic.‚Äù  
  
¬† I ignored him and watched as Sussman walked over to a third dead person on the scene, a striking woman with blond hair and a fire engine red skirt suit. She screamed femininity and power. I liked her instantly. Sussman shook her hand. Then they both turned to look at the only dead person present lying in a pool of his own blood.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI think they know each other,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù Uncle Bob asked, glancing around as if he could see them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou got an ID on this guy?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù He fished out his notebook, reminding me I needed to dash into Staples. All my little notebooks were filled to maximum capacity. As a result, I kept writing pertinent information on my hand, then accidentally washing it off. ‚ÄúJason Barber. A lawyer at‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSussman, Ellery, and Barber,‚Äù Sussman said in unison with Uncle Bob.

It‚Äôs owned and run by the chef and his family. They are genuinely kind, hardworking people who have lived in Kingston for decades and they care deeply about what they put on your plate. The food is excellent, made with care, and more affordable than a lot of the other fine dining options around. The drinks too, $12‚Äì14 cocktails, $8 shots, are more than reasonable for a European-style bistro.

There‚Äôs also coffee, espresso, and free Wi-Fi, and a Monday‚ÄìFriday happy hour that is honestly *criminally* underused. And here‚Äôs a secret: if you ask, they‚Äôll make omelets and French toast, even though it‚Äôs not on the menu.They‚Äôre delicious. Super flexible about substitutions and off menu bar snacks too.

For some reason a mother started beating her child. She was angry and she hit her child so hard that the child almost turned blue. Somebody then asked U.G., 'Why did you not interfere and stop her?' U.G. answered, 'I was standing there. I was puzzled: ""Whom should I pity, the mother or the child?"" Both were in a awkward situation: the mother could not control her anger, and the child was so helpless. Then I found all marks corresponding to the marks of the beatings on my back.

1mxg6tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1mxg6tv/what_is_your_day_like_wife/,What is your day like (wife)?,"I am just trying to look for some information on **what a day should look like on an average american home.** 

I currently attend classes at college and have summers pretty much off (one class online during summer). We have a 2-year-old (almost 3 now) boy full of energy, with speech delay, very sensitive, clingy to me, and sometimes whiny. Most days are me trying to do stuff around the house, study, etc, with my son asking for my attention. My MIL often takes him to the library or the park for 2-3 hours when I have something important that requires lots of focus.

My husband says I don't do anything the whole day/summer, so he tells me I need to do 4-3 projects per month during summer. Usually it's something like: spray lawn with weedkiller, organize the basement (most of the stuff there is his old childhood stuff), change something in the house for the better, like declutter rooms, fix something that is broken, learn programming/create an online portfolio with computer stuff. 

Now, what he does is work from home. Some days are busy, other days it's chill. He doesn't do anything else. No laundry, no lawn mowing (he did buy a robot lawn mower that helps, but I still have to go out to string trim, pull/burn weeds, mow where the robot can't go, etc), no caring for kid (no bath time, no feeding, no bedtime), etc.

I basically do anything and everything related to housework, plus care for the kid, plus help MIL with stuff like doctor's appointments, lawyer meetings, and budgeting her money, and lawn work.

  
His complaints: 

\- I don't make lunch often enough for him (he is really picky, so I can't prep food in advance, I need to ask 1-2 hours before, then cook it, and I can't just ask what he wants to eat, I need to have a list of things to offer and list them)

\-not enough sex (our kid ends up sleeping with us often because I never get to actually create a bedtime routine, which would take about 2h every night for a few weeks till the kid gets used to it.)

\-I am not excited to spend time with him ( he often wants to watch movies around 2-3 am which ends up extending till 4-5 am, then I have to be up 8 am with the kid, my average sleep has been 5h for this year, it was 4 1/2 hrs last year)

\*Most days look like this:

8 am wake up with kid, coffee and try to get kid to eat something

9:30 am get dog outside, sit outside a bit because kid wants to play outside which I let him do for a few minutes

10 am try to tidy up the main room (kitchen and living room) a bit, clean up , run dishwasher etc.

10:30/40 am get coffee going for husband

11am get husband up ( after I give him his coffe i have to reheat it every 10 minutes t keep it warm)

between 11:30 am to 3 pm its a mix of playing with kid, working on words, potty training stuff, time outs, dog care, reheating coffee, etc.) 

around 2/3 pm MIL may take him to library 

4:30 pm ask what husband wants for dinner (again needs list)

4:30 pm -6pm if MIL still out, i work on computer programming learning, read stuff about being a wife because i seem to be failing at it, look at budget for groceries, look for recipes that are easy, taste good and husband might like, look for jobs, etc.  


6 pm start getting dinner on the works,

7:25 pm dinner (which sometimes get delayed if i have to stop multiple times because kid is being a toddler.)

btw 9 pm-11pm is a mix of getting kid to get bath, or a tea for husband if he is feeling sick after dinner, cleaning up or just laying down for a while if husband wants to watch movie later.

2 am get up to make another dinner and watch movie (kid usually wakes up in the middle, then i have to bring him downstairs he will either go to sleep on the couch or stay awake with us)

5 am go to sleep

8 am repeat.

Sorry for the long text here. I am just lost, I don't know exactly what i am doing wrong because growing up my parents weren't like this, we all did chores together as a family even when my mom wasn't working outside the house. Besides, I am from another country, so although I have been here for 6 years, I still have trouble with this expectation for a wife.

>Voldemort dies. And then he wakes up to see Harry Potter, for he had cheated death. AU.

>\~\*\~

>‚ÄúHow proud Tom Riddle would be,‚Äù Potter whispers. ‚ÄúTo know himself the main source of his torments. His main opponent. How delighted; for it seems that a man‚Äôs greatest foe is only himself.‚Äù

This one lives in that eerie space after ‚ÄúThe End,‚Äù where quiet feels louder than war. The hook is simple‚ÄîVoldemort dies and then doesn‚Äôt‚Äîand the fic squeezes it for everything it‚Äôs worth: identity horror, obsession, and the awful gravity of being seen by the only person who truly knows you. Skaeld writes like a scalpel: clean lines, no wasted motion, and then suddenly you‚Äôre bleeding. Harry‚Äôs stillness is a *choice* here, not a void, and watching Tom misread it (and then refuse to) is addictive. The magic has weight, the silences have teeth, and every conversation feels like two duelists choosing to aim for the heart. It‚Äôs romantic in the way avalanches are romantic‚Äîinevitable, terrifying, a little holy. If you love ‚Äúmonster learns devotion the hard way,‚Äù welcome home.

>He can‚Äôt see anything, until he can. Red eyes, glowing ominously through the grey haze.

>‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Harry says. ‚ÄúAs if enough people aren‚Äôt trying to kill me already.‚Äù

Held at wandpoint by the Ministry on spurious charges, Head Auror Potter is rescued by an unlikely saviour ‚Ä¶

Except to everyone else, it‚Äôs really not unlikely at all.

Opens like a movie‚Äîsmoke, rubble, red eyes through the haze‚Äîand never lets the adrenaline fully drain. Head Auror Harry is competent, snarky, and so done with everyone‚Äôs nonsense; pairing him with an ‚Äúunlikely savior‚Äù who is only unlikely to *him* is catnip. The fic nails that delicious space where enemies become partners on a technicality: banter as foreplay, tactics as intimacy, trust defined as ‚ÄúI believe you‚Äôll keep your word because breaking it would be inefficient.‚Äù Ministry grime, media optics, and chain-of-command politics make the alliance feel dangerously plausible. Voldemort is not declawed‚Äîhe‚Äôs useful the way a hurricane clears a calendar‚Äîand the plot uses that menace to stage heist-tight set pieces. You‚Äôre here for the sparks, but you stay because the consequences actually stick.

>Harry goes back in time to raise a young Tom Riddle - except Voldemort gets there first.

>(Tom is left in the dubious care of two not-fathers who occasionally try to kill each other.)

Time-travel guardianfic, but make it feral. Harry decides to raise young Tom Riddle; Voldemort decides to‚Ä¶ help. Out of spite. Domesticity turns into a battleground where bedtime stories, lesson plans, and porridge are weapons in a philosophical knife fight. Young Tom is written as a child and a riddle at once‚Äîequal parts vulnerable and alarming‚Äîso every small choice feels like it could tilt history. The tone swings from laugh-out-loud absurd (two not-dads who occasionally try to murder each other) to quietly devastating without ever feeling whiplashy. Under the humor sits a serious argument about nature, nurture, and the cost of trying to love something that might be a storm. It‚Äôs smart, weird, and weirdly moving.

>It begins with Vernon Dursley's body, dead across the table.

>¬†  
*In which Voldemort is dosed with amortentia, and nothing is better for it.*

Takes a cracky premise (Amortentia + Voldemort) and refuses to play it for giggles; instead you get a moral autopsy with the precision of a curse. The atmosphere is hushed and clinical‚Äîlong shadows, careful knives‚Äîand that restraint makes every line land twice as hard. Consent here isn‚Äôt a checkbox; it‚Äôs a maze, and the exits keep shifting depending on who‚Äôs holding the wand. Voldemort under artificial desire is still Voldemort‚Äîlucid, grand, terrifying‚Äîand the fic keeps asking whether intention matters when outcomes are monstrous. Harry‚Äôs reactions are complicated (revulsion, curiosity, anger, pity) in a way that feels human rather than performative. It‚Äôs uncomfortable on purpose, beautiful by accident, and you‚Äôll close the tab a little haunted and a lot impressed.

>Harry Potter is a time-travelling, furious mess and he is going to kill the Dark Lord. Like most of his plans, things do not work out.  
Tom should not be so obsessed with his would-be murderer.

This plays like a thriller with teeth: razor dialogue, quick cuts, and the sickly-sweet intimacy of a predator purring ‚Äúmy murderer‚Äù into your ear. Time travel isn‚Äôt a fix-it here; it‚Äôs an accelerant. Harry arrives furious and sure, only to find that intention shatters on contact with Tom‚Äôs logic. The fic excels at that Tom Riddle flavor of courtly menace‚Äîattentive, articulate, and catastrophically persuasive‚Äîwhile letting Harry stay angry, competent, and stubbornly moral. Magic feels dangerous and specific, set pieces snap together with clockmaker precision, and the cat-and-mouse dynamic keeps swapping who‚Äôs the cat. Come for the premise; stay because the obsession creeps under your skin and starts breathing there.

>Fifteen-year-old Voldemort looked entirely innocent: scrawny, pale, dressed in tattered gray orphanage rags - he looked utterly sickly and emaciated... just like a child. Yet, this frail facade concealed a true Satan, merciless and insane. Within a year, he will kill Moaning Myrtle, and then his father, grandfather, and grandmother. He was already poisoned. ""Come on, come on! Do it!"" Potter was attempting to convince himself. Time passed, and he still stared, unable to utter the two necessary words.

The 1940s shimmer here like cold mercury: orphanage rags, prefect badges, old blood politics, and a boy whose frailty is only a costume. The fic takes that awful stutter between ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just a child‚Äù and ‚Äúhe will become a catastrophe‚Äù and stretches it into white-knuckle suspense. It‚Äôs a story about hesitation as a moral event‚Äîtwo words caught in Harry‚Äôs throat‚Äîand about Tom‚Äôs talent for turning every pause, every kindness, into leverage. You get aristocratic intrigue (hello, Blacks), ritual-heavy magic that hums like live wire, and a slow-burn chess match where every move has a price in dignity. If you like atmospheric time travel that smells of ink, dust, and danger‚Äîand that asks whether watching is already a choice‚Äîyou‚Äôll devour this.

Both Harry and Hermione's courage will be tested when they are confronted by chances of romance from the most unexpected of places, and unlikely enemies hiding in the tallgrass.  
Lost in the past, they may well forget the way home.  
Not DH compliant.

A classic time-slip with bite: Harry and Hermione drop into Tom Riddle‚Äôs prime, and suddenly courage means knowing when *not* to speak. The charm here is balance‚Äîadventure beats and romantic temptations, yes, but anchored by the stubborn, practical heart of the H/Hr friendship. 1940s Hogwarts is textured (manners as weapons, secrets in the tall grass), Tom is magnetic in that maddening Head-Boy way, and the narrative keeps asking what ‚Äúhome‚Äù even means when the past starts fitting like a tailored robe. It‚Äôs wistful without being soggy, clever without being smug, and the choices feel earned. If you want a past-era romp that respects consequences and lets Hermione shine while Tom sharpens every scene by simply being in it‚Äîthis is your ticket.

>Horror strikes him down where he stands, then. He sways, stumbles to put his back to the living room wall. Harry is woozy in disbelief, watching the two words slashed into his chest in livid red just like the scar on his forehead. ‚ÄòAVADA KEDAVRA.‚Äô

>He knows those words, the first he can remember, his earliest memory. It feels like he hasn‚Äôt breathed in minutes. When he comes back to the moment, he finds that perhaps he hasn‚Äôt. Harry gasps for air like a fish does for water, and doesn‚Äôt find it. His back has slid down the wall somehow and his hands grip his head, hair clenched in fists.

>Then he realizes he‚Äôs actually panting, a ringing in his ears, blocking out whatever it is people are saying to him. Hermione crouches in front of him where he can‚Äôt possibly miss her, palms settling gently on his knees.

>‚ÄúHarry,‚Äù she‚Äôs saying. ‚ÄúHarry, it‚Äôs going to be alright.‚Äù

>\-

>In a world where the first words you ever speak to your soulmate appear once both soulmates have turned seventeen, Harry receives a bit of bad news.

>OR

>In which Harry fashions himself into a war bride.

Soulmate marks, but make it horror: two words that should promise a meet-cute arrive like a curse, and the fic never lets you forget how frightening destiny can be. The opening panic is visceral‚Äîbreathless, ringing ears, the body remembering before the mind does‚Äîand from there it becomes a character study in agency. Harry refuses to be a prophecy‚Äôs passenger; he builds himself into a weapon, a shield, a war bride if he must. The romance (if that‚Äôs the word) is operatic‚ÄîTom‚Äôs obsession is a cathedral under construction‚Äîand the world keeps throwing practical obstacles that test more than hearts. Expect smart uses of the soulmate trope (consent, choice, definition of ‚Äúfated‚Äù), friends who *actually* act like friends, and prose that flips between tender and terrifying without dropping the beat. It‚Äôs bloody, beautiful, and impossible to put down.

'He prays for the Defense curse to work this year.'

>That one where a sixteen-year old Tom Riddle escapes his paper prison and takes Harry with him, only reappearing three years later.

This has the best kind of nightmare logic: a sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle slips out of his ‚Äúpaper prison,‚Äù grabs Harry by the wrist, and the world blinks‚Äîthree years gone. The fic leans into that missing time like a bruise you can‚Äôt stop pressing: what did they become to each other in the dark? Why does Harry flinch like someone who‚Äôs learned to read a monster‚Äôs footsteps‚Äîand why does Tom sound so *fond* when he purrs for the Defense curse to work this year? It‚Äôs a thriller stitched to a fairy tale: ink and teeth, tenderness used like a trap, and a slow, uncanny intimacy that feels exactly like falling in love with the thing that‚Äôs hunting you. If you want the diary arc reimagined as gothic abduction with brain-worm chemistry, this one bites and then kisses the mark.

>(In which Harry learns: if Voldemort had been like an atom bomb, Tom Riddle is the biblical forbidden fruit, succulent and fragrant and filled with an¬†*insidious*¬†rot that just may kill him.)

Body horror, identity horror, *social* horror‚Äîthis one rolls them together and hands you a mirror. Harry wakes with Tom Riddle‚Äôs face looking back, and the fic never flinches from what that means: politics that taste like copper, Slytherin etiquette sharp enough to cut, and a seduction that isn‚Äôt about kisses so much as *recognition*. Tom is the biblical forbidden fruit here‚Äîfragrant, gorgeous, and quietly rotting from the core‚Äîand the narrative understands why someone starving might still take a bite. What makes it sing is restraint: scenes that feel overheard, consequences that stick, and a romance that moves like a chess match where every exchanged piece is a piece of yourself. It‚Äôs elegant, vicious, and unforgettable.

‚ÄúThis is a horror story. This is a love story.‚Äù The fic means it. Voldemort-wins vibes, a world that feels one degree colder than canon, and Harry waking into a life where mercy and possession wear the same perfume. Compassion becomes his tragic flaw, forgiveness a gift he doesn‚Äôt remember granting, and the question gnawing at every chapter is simple and awful: can love *flourish* in a heart that never consented? The writing is lush but disciplined‚Äîcandlelit rooms, old magic humming like high voltage, a captor who is neither who he was nor who he pretends to be. It‚Äôs a slow suffocation that you keep *choosing* to breathe with; by the end you‚Äôll be wrecked, furious, and weirdly reverent.

>Harry steals from the wrong people and finds himself left for dead with a bullet in his skull.

>Except he doesn't die.

>And now, he has an infamous criminal organization called the Death Eaters hot on his tail, determined to correct that mistake. Even worse, the group is led by a deranged kingpin named Voldemort, who seems to think trying to kill Harry is the best fun he's had in years.

Mafia AU with rocket fuel: Harry steals from the wrong people, doesn‚Äôt die when he should, and ends up being courted by a crime empire that uses bullets the way wizards use hexes. Tom as kingpin is gloriously awful‚Äîmeticulous, possessive, amused like a cat with a laser pointer‚Äîand the cat-and-mouse sequences are pure serotonin. But the secret sauce is character: adult Harry who fights dirty *and fair*, who will flirt with doom if it gets him leverage, who refuses to be anyone‚Äôs victim even when he‚Äôs literally bleeding on nightclub tile. It‚Äôs stylish, funny, violent in the ‚Äúoh no, I‚Äôm grinning‚Äù way, and the chemistry is so deranged you‚Äôll start rooting for terrible decisions just to see what happens next.

When Harry arrives at the most prestigious theatrical school in the country, under very suspicious circumstances, he doesn't have many expectations. The most unexpected thing he encounters, however, is one Tom Riddle.

>Amidst peers of great talent, his worry for his Godfather, unconventional Professors, and a vague sense of unworthiness, Harry falls in love with the only other person who deals with feelings as well as him.

>But maybe, just maybe, he and Tom will find out that not all love stories have to end in tragedy.

Dark-academia theatre AU that smells like dust, sweat, and ambition. Harry stumbles into the country‚Äôs most elite acting school under questionable circumstances; Tom Riddle is the rising star who treats love like a role he intends to master. What follows is rehearsal as seduction, blocking as boundary, and performance as the most honest lie two boys can tell. The dialogue is razor-witty, the ensemble is a mess in black turtlenecks, and the romance is tender without losing its bite‚Äîtwo people with equally tragic communication skills trying to craft something that doesn‚Äôt end in blood on closing night. It‚Äôs intoxicating, clever, and unexpectedly hopeful: a reminder that not every Tomarry story has to burn itself down to be brilliant.

>Tom and Harry are inevitable in any universe.

>OR: While Dumbledore and Grindelwald play their chess game across Europe, two young wizards form an unlikely friendship.

>\[That one where Tom and Harry are born in the same generation.\]

Childhood rivals to strange allies done right: Tom and Harry share an era, which means every house point, every hallway debate, every tiny mercy compounds into a trajectory neither can quite escape. The fic hums with pre-war tension‚ÄîGrindelwald and Dumbledore play continental chess while two clever boys discover the dangerous pleasure of being understood. It‚Äôs romantically charged without being hurried, political without losing the heartbeat of friendship, and written with that polite menace Tom wears like a school tie. You read for the meetings in dusty classrooms, the exchanged books, the grudging respect‚Äîthen realize the author has been laying track for an emotional train you can‚Äôt stop. ‚ÄúInevitable‚Äù has never felt so thrilling.

Fake dating, but make it Harrymort: Voldemort proposes a PR romance and Harry, with the world‚Äôs most exhausted sigh, says yes. From there it‚Äôs equal parts satire and sincerity‚Äîpress conferences as dueling grounds, staged hand-holding that feels far too natural, and the unnerving revelation that pretending to be safe with a monster requires learning exactly how he thinks. The joke lands (often), but the heart lands harder: Harry‚Äôs agency is never the punchline, and Tom‚Äôs fascination is written with a comedian‚Äôs timing and a surgeon‚Äôs precision. It‚Äôs fizzy, rude, unexpectedly tender, and it remembers something most fake-dating AUs forget‚Äîperformance changes the performers.

The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning.

>A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.

Voldemort-wins done with gravitas: a dystopia that feels lived-in, a Lord who is both visionary and vile, and a Harry whose heroism has been ground down to something dark, private, and stubbornly alive. The moment in the Forest is an epiphany with teeth; from there the fic interrogates power, complicity, and the terrifying intimacy of a tyrant who desires not your body but your *soul*. Politics matter here‚Äîlaws, propaganda, the cost of saying nothing‚Äîand so do small, human rituals of resistance. It‚Äôs bleak but not empty, sensual without glamorizing violence, and obsessed (in the best way) with what‚Äôs left of a person when glory is gone. You don‚Äôt read this one to be comforted; you read it to be changed.

>Harry Potter and Tom Riddle are enemies, born adversaries, prophesied leaders of opposite factions.

>2001 to 1932, forty-seven days to change the fate of the Dark Lord.

>This is a 'Harry travels back in time to raise Tom' story. An unfortunate tale of one man's failed attempt to mold young Tom into a decent, law-abiding citizen. Instead, as Fate will have it, young Tom grows up to become the same twisted psychopath, who is hell-bent on winning the love of his adoptive father. Harry's consent be damned.

A countdown fic with teeth. The clock starts at forty-seven days and every choice thuds like a heartbeat in your ears: teach, shelter, scold, trust‚Äîand watch each tiny mercy become leverage in Tom‚Äôs clever hands. It‚Äôs the bleak, fascinating version of ‚Äúraise young Riddle‚Äù that refuses easy hope: nature vs. nurture gets tried in a court where love is the star witness *and* the main piece of evidence against you. The prose is steady and unsentimental, which only sharpens the ache as Harry‚Äôs optimism chips away, then fractures, then re-forms into something harder. If you like moral dilemmas you can‚Äôt stop turning over, a creeping sense of inevitability, and the awful tenderness of a boy who learns to love like a knife, this one will live in your head rent-free.

>Harry Potter is screwed.

>With a penchant for Firewhiskey and late-night parties, he had no idea that he would find a handsome man in his bed the next morning, when he wakes up; already late for his first day at St. Mungo‚Äôs Hospital for Magical Maladies as a Healer trainee. He also had no idea that his mom‚Äôs ex-boyfriend would have an axe to grind, the most eager girl would follow him around like she‚Äôd been hit with a Permanent Sticking Charm, or that the handsome man in his bed that morning was his boss, Tom Marvolo Riddle, Head of Spell Damage.

>Like I said, Harry Potter is screwed.

Hangover rom-com meets hospital drama, and somehow it works *beautifully*. The tone is fizzy‚ÄîHarry‚Äôs chaos, HR nightmares, colleagues who are both gremlins and angels‚Äîbut beneath the jokes there‚Äôs that irresistible power clash: trainee vs. Head of Spell Damage, disaster vs. precision, attraction vs. professionalism. Tom is weaponized competence in expensive robes; Harry is a walking firework who keeps showing up and doing the job anyway. You stay for the banter, the catastrophe medicine set pieces, the way responsibility turns out to be the hottest thing in the room‚Äîand for the moment you realize this isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúoops, my boss is hot,‚Äù it‚Äôs two very different people learning how to meet in the middle without losing their edges.

>Tom goes to the Emerald Owl caf√© because it has the best coffee on campus. Really. Not at all to see the irritating, yet adorable, green eyed barista who always fails to write the correct name for his order.

Pure comfort with teeth of wit. It‚Äôs the campus coffee-shop AU that remembers the joy is in the *micro-choices*: how a name is misspelled on purpose (or not), the rhythm of ‚Äúyour usual?‚Äù, the slow shift from silly rivalry to a private language of glances and cups. Tom‚Äôs pettiness is a love letter; Harry‚Äôs sunshine is a boundary; and together they build the kind of low-stakes intimacy that sneaks up on you and suddenly matters more than anything. Expect soft humor, immaculate timing, and that fizzy ache when you realize the daily coffee is the point, not the prelude.

# [V Is For Vampire](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27204785) by [duplicity](https://archiveofourown.org/users/duplicity/pseuds/duplicity)

One cursed night over seventy years ago, Harry agreed to bite Tom and turn him into a vampire. Flash forward to today, when Tom hires a rag-tag group of starving film students to film a documentary about their lives as two totally platonic vampire pals.

>Because Tom thinks their life as vampires is interesting enough for mainstream media.

>Because he‚Äôs crazy.

>Harry should have just let Tom die of old age like any other sane person would have done.

‚ÄúWhat We Do in the Shadows,‚Äù but make it Tomarry. Decades of bickering distilled into a deadpan mockumentary where immortality looks suspiciously like roommate hell, and the film students are one broken boom mic away from fleeing the set. The jokes land hard‚Äîself-owning voiceovers, creative misuse of vampire lore, PR disasters with fangs‚Äîbut the secret engine is tenderness: two ‚Äútotally platonic‚Äù idiots who have been saving each other from boredom and oblivion for seventy years. It‚Äôs sharp, rude, and weirdly romantic; you‚Äôll cackle, then catch yourself feeling something that isn‚Äôt a joke at all.

>Tom Riddle is a frightening coil of darkness, cruelty, and greatness, and changing him is Harry‚Äôs only hope for saving people he loves. Going back in time, he takes Tom from the orphanage, but his optimism shatters with every year they spend together.

>Tom still longs for darkness. Tom stifles him in his possessiveness. Tom is fixated on him to the point of destroying the world just to keep him.

>But Harry loves him. And the future changes.

The long, painful version of the ‚Äúraise Tom‚Äù gambit‚Äîthe one that refuses to blink. Year by year, you watch love turn from strategy to conviction, and conviction turn into the very chain Tom plans to use to anchor the world to himself. It‚Äôs intoxicating and awful: Harry‚Äôs hope thinning, thickening, changing species; Tom learning devotion like a new spell, jealous and world-sized. The prose is lush without losing control, the escalation is patient, and the romance feels like standing in the tide‚Äîpulled, battered, and still somehow choosing to stay. If you want a story that honors both the horror and the holiness of loving something dangerous, this is it.

>A mysterious object in Bellatrix's vault sends Harry, Ron and Hermione spinning into the past and to a Hogwarts like none they know.  
Posing as students, Harry catches the eye of the Head Boy, Tom Riddle, who is nothing like the Voldemort of the future. He's charming and sly and manipulative; both brillant and deadly.

>It isn‚Äôt long before they‚Äôre tangled in a game more intricate than anything before. A game of heightened stakes, of tension, and the odds are stacked against Harry. With the threads of the future unravelling, can Harry make it out intact? And what is the cost, of truly getting close to Tom?

Golden-age Hogwarts with razor edges. Head Boy Tom is all charm and knives, and the fic treats the school like a political city-state where manners are weapons and secrets buy you real power. The tension ladder is immaculate: undercover classes, corridor chess, and that awful/sublime thrill of realizing Tom doesn‚Äôt want to *ruin* Harry so much as *understand* him‚Äîand that might be worse. The trio dynamic stays smart and useful (Hermione is lethal with a library), set pieces crackle, and the cost of closeness is never hand-waved. Slick, dangerous, and addictive.

**Russian-language Tomarry fics absolutely slap. Even if you don‚Äôt read Russian, most of these are perfectly readable with a translator‚Äîpop the page into your favorite tool (DeepL/Google), skim the tags, and enjoy. The vibes survive translation frighteningly well. üíÖüñ§**

>**English title:** **‚ÄúGrease My Palm, Will You?‚Äù**  
**English description:** Tom visits Diagon Alley for the first time and, by pure chance, meets a young palm-reader who goes simply by Harry.

Fortune-telling as meet-cute is already adorable; making the seer a tiny, deadpan Harry and the client a wide-eyed first-time Tom in Diagon Alley turns it into alchemy. The fic leans into small magic‚Äîhands, lines on skin, the hush of a shop bell‚Äîand uses it to sketch a dynamic that‚Äôs curious rather than instantly feral. Tom‚Äôs hunger for answers meets Harry‚Äôs impish professionalism, and the humor is light without deflating the wonder. If you like your Tomarry with tactile details, gentle wit, and that ‚Äúoh no, they‚Äôre kind of meant to orbit‚Äù feeling, this one goes down like honeyed tea.

Peak farce with Slytherin bite. The premise‚Äîridiculous ‚Äútasks‚Äù escalating from hand-holding to ‚Äúand with tongue this time, Riddle‚Äù‚Äîlets the author roast Hogwarts social games while secretly charting Tom‚Äôs crash-course in intimacy. It‚Äôs brisk, quotable, and weaponizes awkwardness like a duel: who blushes first loses. Beneath the comedy there‚Äôs a surprisingly tender lesson about consent, timing, and how practice makes‚Ä¶ well, not perfect, but honest.

>**English description:** Voldemort is dead. It‚Äôs Christmas Day, and Harry has just opened a present from Fred and George Weasley.

Grief-soft and winter-bright. Voldemort is gone; it‚Äôs Christmas; the gift is small but the ache is not. The fic excels at that post-war quiet where humor coexists with the sting, and it lets Harry‚Äôs memory make a mosaic of love that was terrible and real. Minimalism is the power move here: a few careful images, an offhand joke from the twins, and suddenly the room feels full. If you crave catharsis without melodrama, this is the kind of short that sits in your chest and glows.

A ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù that actually thinks it through: dial down Gryffindor bravado, dial up Slytherin calculus, add pacifism and zero tolerance for puppet-masters‚Äîthen watch the timeline wobble. The joy here is in smart strategy and moral nuance; Harry doesn‚Äôt stop being kind, he becomes *effective*, and Tom‚Äôs responses are fascinating when confronted with a counterpart who won‚Äôt be baited. Political mechanics click, the prose is clear, and the result feels like a canon-adjacent AU that could plausibly have happened. Brainy and satisfying.

Gothic fairy-tale energy, all candlewax and grave-dust. The Necropolis folk tale no one loves‚Äîexcept Tom‚Äîbecomes a lens for obsession, fate, and the kind of devotion that looks holy from far away and terrifying up close. It reads like a story you shouldn‚Äôt tell a child but do anyway because it‚Äôs true. Lyrical without being purple, it gives Tom a myth to fit himself into and Harry a shadow to step out of.

And who suffered more from this neighborly arrangement? Not even old Merlin could say.

Chaotic urban fantasy romp with the comedic timing of a sit-com and the imagination of a fever dream. Post-sixth-year Harry moves into a Muggle flat and gets a neighbor who is‚Ä¶ stepson of Jack the Ripper, alien robot, and Mordred‚Äôs after-burp‚Äîi.e., Tom Marvolo Riddle. It‚Äôs gloriously unhinged in premise but disciplined in payoff: snappy banter, set-piece shenanigans, and a surprisingly coherent conspiracy you‚Äôll happily chase.

>**Summary (EN):**  
Harry becomes trapped in a time loop after traveling to the past. Each time he wakes up in August 1946, when nineteen-year-old Tom Riddle is working at Borgin and Burkes. He tries to kill, befriend, and even join Tom in hopes of preventing him from becoming the Dark Lord‚Äîbut fails every time. In the end, Harry wakes with one goal left: to seduce Tom Riddle.

Time-loop Tomarry done like a speedrun with changing categories: assassination%, friendship%, join-him%, and finally seduction%. Every reset in August 1946 peels back a new facet of nineteen-year-old Tom‚Äîcharming shopboy at Borgin & Burkes, snake under glass, scholar who collects motives like cursed rings. The loop isn‚Äôt just a gimmick; it‚Äôs a character vise. You watch Harry pivot from savior to strategist to siren, learning which version of himself actually moves the needle, and the fic keeps the tone agile‚Äîblack humor in the gloom of Knockturn Alley, then a sudden, disarming tenderness that feels like cheating fate. If you crave ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù tension with gothic dust and knives, plus the delicious heresy of *choosing* seduction as a tactic, this hits all the right nerves.

During the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry and Voldemort become stuck in a time loop.

Battle-of-Hogwarts locked in a time loop strips the cast to essentials: two adversaries, one battlefield, infinite do-overs. The fic turns resets into drumbeats‚Äîviolence, negotiation, silence‚Äîand watches which truth cracks first: prophecy, pride, or the story they tell about each other. It‚Äôs intimate without being soft; every loop adds one new line of understanding, one new scar, one new rule broken. The puzzle is clever, the choreography tight, but what lingers is the exhausted, magnetic honesty that only shows up on loop one-hundred-something. You‚Äôll start reading for the mechanics and end up shipping the ceasefire.

Harry‚Äôs life is wrapped in mystery. Dreams that feel real won‚Äôt let him rest‚Äîbut it isn‚Äôt all bad when someone dear stands beside him, saving him from every danger. Except‚Ä¶ why, in those dreams, is he called the Dark Lord‚Äîand why is he trying to kill Harry?  
*(Harry falls into the past, to the orphanage where Tom Marvolo Riddle lives, and they become friends.)*

Dreams that feel real, a protector who feels safe, and the rotten little truth that the man with the mercy in your dreams is also the monster with the wand. The fic braids soft horror with found-family warmth: orphanage breakfasts, shared secrets, tiny rituals of care‚Äîshadowed by the knowledge of what Tom can become. It‚Äôs compelling because it refuses to pick a lane: comfort and dread keep trading places, and Harry‚Äôs agency doesn‚Äôt evaporate just because he‚Äôs young or haunted. If you like stories where love is both salvation and a loaded gun, this will get under your skin.

1mxg429,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1mxg429/i_reached_out_to_apologise/,I reached out to apologise.,"So, many years ago I was seeing a man and I thought we were very much in love. Then i found out he cheated on me so the relationship ended.

After 8 years he reached out to me and asked if he could meet up with me, his parents had passed away and he had no close friends at the time. I felt bad for him so told him that I would meet him as a friend only. Which I did, thinking we could be friends, believing this was his intention and he needed support while he was grieving. 

Anyway, after meeting him for coffee I went home and received a message basically asking for more than friendship from me, when I said that that was not what I was after and I just wanted to be there for him I received a response that he didn't want to be friends with me and that I wouldn't hear from him again. He wanted a relationship even though I had made it clear I didn't before catching up. I retaliated and made some comments about him living his karma and that he should try and be a better person. It ended with him telling me I was always a bitch. That was 10 years ago. 

Im currently going through a separation and have been doubting the person I am. 

Im a childhood trauma survivor and being the best person I can be is very important to me and the things I said I had dwelled on for many years. It has never sit right. So I reached out via messenger (I dont have fb so half expecting my message to go into the abyss). Long story short, I received a response thanking me for apologising and we wished each other well. I thought it was cool. 

Then I receive a message late at night and he wants to keep chatting, I explained that I was reaching out to apologise and wish him well but that im in a relationship (even though we are separated, I don't want to share that with him) and want to be respectful so I don't want to continue chatting, wished him the best again... 

Now hes come back and said that I have disrupted his peace and that the apology was for myself. Which yes, it was but also because I didn't want to leave things on bad terms with anyone.

Please someone tell me, have I done the wrong thing here? I still feel like a weight has lifted as I have wanted to apologise for a long time. Seems I have upset him or angered him by doing so.",0,1755891259.0,AskWomenOver30,20,0.27,False

Planning a trip to Lanzarote? This captivating Canary Island offers a unique blend of volcanic landscapes, golden beaches, cultural wonders, and laid-back charm. Whether you're an adventure seeker, beach lover or culture enthusiast, this 7-day Lanzarote itinerary will help you make the most of your time on the island.

**Day 1: Arrival and Beach Time in Puerto del Carmen**

Start your holiday in **Puerto del Carmen**, one of Lanzarote's most popular resort towns. After checking in, unwind with a walk along the Avenida de las Playas, and soak up the sun on Playa Grande. For dinner, try some fresh seafood at a local beachfront restaurant and relax into island time.

**Day 2: Volcanoes and Lunar Landscapes at Timanfaya National Park**

Day two is all about Lanzarote's iconic volcanic terrain. Head to **Timanfaya National Park**, where the Monta√±as del Fuego (Fire Mountains) create an otherworldly landscape. Take a guided coach tour or a camel ride across the volcanic ash. In the afternoon, visit **El Golfo**, a stunning green lagoon next to a black sand beach.

**Day 3: La Geria Wine Region and Local Flavours**

Explore **La Geria**, Lanzarote‚Äôs unique wine-growing region, where vines grow in volcanic craters. Visit a few bodegas for wine tasting, especially those offering Malvas√≠a wines. Stop by a traditional village like **Yaiza** for a leisurely lunch and enjoy the peaceful rural scenery.

**Day 4: Cultural Treasures and C√©sar Manrique‚Äôs Legacy**

No visit to Lanzarote is complete without discovering the works of local artist and architect **C√©sar Manrique**. Start at the **C√©sar Manrique Foundation** in Tah√≠che, his former home built into lava bubbles.

**Day 5: Northern Highlights ‚Äì Mirador del R√≠o and √ìrzola**

Venture north to **Mirador del R√≠o**, a clifftop viewpoint offering breathtaking panoramas of **La Graciosa island**. Continue to the fishing village of **√ìrzola** for a quiet lunch by the sea. If time allows, take a short ferry trip to La Graciosa and explore its pristine beaches.

**Day 6: Beach Day in Playa Blanca and Papagayo Beaches**

Spend a relaxing day in **Playa Blanca**, known for its calm waters and excellent restaurants. In the afternoon, visit the stunning **Papagayo Beaches**, a series of golden coves surrounded by cliffs. These are perfect for swimming, snorkelling or simply enjoying the peace and beauty of unspoilt nature.

**Day 7: Souvenir Shopping and Departure**

On your final day, pick up some local souvenirs such as aloe vera products, handmade ceramics or Lanzarote wines. Depending on your flight time, enjoy a final coffee in the sun or a walk along the coast. And if you haven‚Äôt booked your ride to the airport yet, consider [**Last Minute Lanzarote Transfers**](https://lastminute-transfer.com/) to get there smoothly and stress-free.

**Final Tips**

* **Transport**: Renting a car gives you flexibility, but the island also has a good bus network.

* **Local Etiquette**: Friendly and welcoming, locals appreciate polite greetings and respect for their traditions.

Lanzarote may be small, but it‚Äôs packed with things to see and do. With this 7-day itinerary, you‚Äôll leave with memories of volcanic landscapes, crystal-clear waters, and the laid-back soul of the Canary Islands.",1,1755891186.0,lanzarotetours,0,1.0,False

So you booked that dream trip to Greece ‚Äì Santorini sunsets, white houses, blue domes, right? Here‚Äôs what the travel blogs forget to mention:
	‚Ä¢	Doctors? On many islands, there‚Äôs literally ONE doctor for thousands. Break a leg? Nearest specialist is probably on another island‚Ä¶ or the mainland.
	‚Ä¢	Roads & water: Think moon craters instead of highways. Street lights? Rare. Running water? Sometimes also rare, because hey, tourists shower too much.
	‚Ä¢	Prices: ‚Ç¨5 for a coffee, ‚Ç¨200/night for a ‚Äúsea view‚Äù that‚Äôs basically a puddle. Taxi drivers? PhDs in overcharging.
	‚Ä¢	Public transport: Buses older than your grandpa, no AC, brakes optional on mountain roads.
	‚Ä¢	Safety: Petty theft rising. Some islands so overcrowded with tourists + migrants that police can‚Äôt keep up.

And yet‚Ä¶ prices keep climbing, infrastructure keeps collapsing, and somehow Greece still tops ‚ÄúBest Destinations‚Äù lists.

Tourist paradise? Sure. Just don‚Äôt get sick, don‚Äôt need to get anywhere fast, and bring two wallets. Minimum.

¬†  
  
¬† Okay. Here's the lowdown. My name is Belle Jamison. I'm twenty-five, happy, engaged and smart depending on who - whom? - you're asking. (Sadly, my teddy bear of a dad is the only one who would pipe up with an affirmative She's brilliant! ) I'm a former coffee wench (plus former bus driver, used-car salesman, factory worker, maid and a thousand other menial jobs), now employed by the mysterious and shadowy government agency known as PSI: Paranormal Studies and Investigations.  
  
¬† Oh, and I happen to control the four elements with my emotions. (If you ask my ultra-hot fiance, Rome, he'll tell you that control is relative. ) Anyway.  
  
¬† Before, I was an everyday, average, normal girl. Normal and wishing for more. I should have known better. Sometimes you actually get what you wish for, and the results are not what you expected. I'd wanted excitement. And yeah, I'd gotten it. But that excitement came with a death warrant.  
  
¬† See, a few months ago a crazy scientist secretly dropped a chemical into my grande mocha latte and that chemical. . . changed me. Belle Jamison, average no longer. Suddenly I could shoot fireballs from my eyes, freeze an entire room with a brush of my fingertips against a wall, cause a tempestuous rainstorm with my tears and start a level-five tornado with only a thought.  
  
¬† At first, I was upset. I mean, really. The ability to destroy the entire world and everyone in it is a huge burden to carry. But that burden also brought the sexy and insatiable Rome Masters into my life, so I don't begrudge it too much. Anymore. Plus, now that I have a little influence over my gift - yeah, that's a better word for it. Gift - people who piss me off ""accidentally"" get their eyebrows singed and that's pretty damn fun.  
  
¬† Sure, Rome once tried to kill me. Or, as he'd say, ""neutralize"" the threat I'd become, as I'd had yet to perfect my new powers. Sure, I later accidentally-on-purpose Tasered the hell out of him. But now we can't live without each other.  
  
¬† That might seem weird, but hey. Some people held hands to show their love; we drew blood. Or we would, if Rome was anywhere to be found.  
  
¬† ""I swear, he has five seconds to call me or I'm going to torch his entire gun collection and use the melted metal to make a few necklaces. Maybe some earrings. ""  
  
¬† My best friend Sherridan looked up from the romance novel propped against her upraised legs. She lounged on the couch, a vision of curly blond hair, big blue eyes more often than not filled with sadness nowadays and curves that went on for miles. I wasn't jealous. Really. ""He's called you, like, four times in the past week. And seriously, you should be embarrassed. I've never met anyone who has as much phone sex as you two. ""  
  
¬† My eyes narrowed on her. ""How do you know about the phone sex?""  
  
¬† ""Duh. I pick up the phone and listen. ""  
  
¬† I gaped at her.  
  
¬† Sherridan laughed. ""Kidding, I was only kidding. But you should see your face. Hi-lar-ious! The problem is, you're, like, freakishly loud. Seriously, earplugs don't help. Cranking up my iPod to full blast doesn't work. Despite myself, I've been really impressed with your skills. "" Color flooded my cheeks. This was the problem with roommates. But better Sherridan and Tanner, my other BFF, lived here where Rome and I could protect them from scrims - supernatural criminals - wanting to hurt us by hurting our loved ones. ""Never mind my incredible phone sex. Rome was supposed to call me again last night. He didn't. He hasn't. That's not like him. Do you think something's wrong?""  
  
¬† ""Stop worrying,"" she said with a wave of dismissal. ""That he-man can morph into a jaguar, for God's sake. He's fine. He's probably planning a surprise homecoming or something. "" Yes, Rome could morph into a jaguar - a sleek and sexy jaguar I loved to pet - all because of experiments he'd volunteered for, hoping to make himself stronger to better guard his loved ones. He could defend himself and he did like to please me, so a surprise arrival wasn't a stretch, but. . . My hand fluttered over the pulse hammering in my throat. ""Really? You think that's what's going on?"" Was that neediness really mine?  
  
¬† ""Of course. ""  
  
¬† She sounded confident. But then, she hadn't battled people more monster than human. People who could walk through walls, shift into creatures of the night and leap at you with fangs and claws bared - or simply materialize in front of you with a knife in hand.  
  
¬† I had. Rome had. And I had no idea what he was up against this time.  
  
¬† Heart thundering in my chest, I stood in the middle of the living room and studied the home I now shared with him. I'd decorated it, so of course it was made of awesome. From the bright red velvet chairs to the beaded blue pillows tossed haphazardly about to the purple lace hanging from the windows, the place was a veritable rainbow. Rome hadn't complained. First time he'd seen it, he had walked in, looked around and shaken his head with a wry smile.  
  
¬† ""Should have expected it,"" he'd said, before pouncing on me for a few hours of undercover fun.  
  
¬† ""He's never not called me when he said he was going to call me, Sherridan. "" I didn't dare refer to her as Sherri. I was the one with superpowers, but she would have found a way to peel the skin from my bones and wear it as a victory coat. ""He has one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. He could be a pile of ash for all I know. "" Oh, God. Another thought like that, and I was likely to flood my beautiful rainbow living room.  
  
¬† Sighing, she shut the book with a snap. ""All right. You need to vent, so I'll listen to you vent. But do it quickly, because Rydstorm was about to plunder Sabine with his thick, hard - ""  
  
¬† ""Sherridan Smith! Tanner's in the next room and from what I've been able to get out of him, he's still mourning Lexis. "" Lexis was Rome's still-infatuated ex-wife. When she'd realized Rome loved me - and would always love me, I added for my own benefit - she had turned to Tanner for comfort. The now twenty-year-old kid-boy- man had been all too willing to console her. Virgin that he was - is? - I think he'd even fallen in love with her. But then, about a week ago, she'd kicked him out of her house, claiming she didn't want to see him again.  
  
¬† Tanner had been a mess ever since.  
  
¬† Lexis was the most powerful psychic I'd ever encountered, so I was willing to bet she'd had a negative vision about Tanner and had cut him loose because of it. While I (sometimes) liked her, though, we weren't on friendly enough terms for me to phone her and ask.  
  
¬† Sherridan's lips lifted in a slow, wicked smile. Her first in days, and that warmed me up inside. Between her and Tanner, I'd gotten my fill of doom and gloom. ""If I know that pervert, he's watching porn. "" I couldn't refute that. Tanner did like his porn.  
  
¬† ""Besides,"" Sherridan said, ""it's not like his superpower is supersonic hearing. "" She was grumbling now.  
  
¬† No, Tanner was an empath. A human lie detector. He could sense emotions, which was why he was the perfect partner for me. He let me know when my feelings - and thereby the world - were about to explode so that I could calm myself down.  
  
¬† ""Call your boss, whatshisname,"" Sherridan suggested. ""Bob. . . or Jim. John!"" She clapped, clearly proud of herself. ""Yes. Call John. He'll know where Rome is. ""  
  
¬† ""I've already spoken to John. I had my mandatory testing twice this week, and he was there to watch the poking and the prodding. "" Because of the chemical I'd ingested and its lingering effects, John liked to monitor me. To our mutual consternation, his tests were totally screwing with my restraint. Every time he had his vampire - you think I'm kidding? - withdraw a vial of my blood, I lost a little more control and my powers went a little wonky. Yesterday I'd turned a potted plant into a treecicle simply by glancing at it.  
  
¬† Or maybe the problem was this distance from Rome. I needed my man. He kept me grounded, centered. He was also able to filter out the worst of my emotions. Yeah, it was probably this temporary separation that was screwing with me. It was screwing with everything else. My peace of mind, my hormones, my appetite.  
  
¬† Was such dependence dangerous? And d  
id I care?  
  
¬† Where the hell was he? My shoulders slumped. ""John wouldn't tell me a damn thing about Rome. Even when I threatened to quit. ""  
  
¬† Sherridan rolled her eyes. ""You threaten to quit every day, so that's no big deal. I told you that if you didn't save the big gun for a big battle, you'd have no ammunition when the big battle finally arrived.  
  
¬† Didn't I? Didn't I tell you that? You're like the boy who cried wolf - or jaguar in this case - and I told you not to do it. I told you. ""  
  
¬† I kicked into motion, pacing over to frown down at her. ""Do you want to be deep-fried?""  
  
¬† ""Please. I'm the only person brave enough to be the maid of honor at a wedding guaranteed to be a Who's Who of Superheroes and Supervillains, so you need me. We both know I'm not in any danger from your fury-fire. ""  
  
¬† No, she wasn't. She was more likely to drown in my tears or freeze from my touch. I was depressed and scared, and my fear always summoned ice, my sadness rain. My anger summoned fire, of course, and my jealousy summoned earth. Yes, I could make dirt pies. Calling the wind required an emotional cocktail of both negative and positive, so it was the hardest to manipulate. It was hard to be happy and sad, loving and hateful at the same time.  
  
¬† Once, for a short window of time, I'd been able to use my powers without relying on my emotions. No longer. For whatever reason - cough John's tests and Rome's absence cough - that was now nothing more than a pipe dream.  
  
¬† ""What if he's. . . "" I couldn't say it. I just couldn't finish that sentence. Suddenly my chin was trembling too badly. God, I was a wreck lately! And no, I wasn't pregnant. (I'd already taken a test. )  
  
¬† ""He's not. Who was Rome battling, anyway? And why didn't you go with him?""  
  
¬† ""Run-of-the-mill armed guards, most likely, and I'm an idiot. Besides, Cody went with him. "" Cody could manipulate electricity, so he was a good partner to have. Better than me, for sure. ""I've been planning a wedding, babysitting yo - uh, Tanner, researching Desert Gall and - ""  
  
¬† ""Desert Gal, huh. "" Sherridan sat up straighter. ""You mean the psycho-bitch who drains the water out of everything she touches?""  
  
¬† ""Yes. That's her. "" Unfortunately - or fortunately? - I hadn't had a face-to-face with the sadistic woman yet. One, she'd managed to elude me and two, I'd been too busy getting nailed by other scrims who'd started coming after me the moment I joined PSI. Their mission: recruit me to OASS - Observation and Application of Supernatural Studies, a nongovernment agency whose methods sometimes bordered on criminal and sometimes straight up were criminal. Or, if they couldn't recruit me, plan B was to kill me.  
  
¬† Eight had tried so far, and I'd managed to beat them all. Okay, okay, Rome had ensured victory most of the time. I was still new at the whole shadow-game thing.  
  
¬† ""What's she look like?"" Sherridan asked.  
  
¬† That was the kicker. No one had a picture of her. Well, not that they'd shown me. Secret agents were so. . . secretive. But still. I'd already proven I was trustworthy, and why not share something that would help me? ""I don't know, but I'm envisioning a dried-up prune with teeth. ""  
  
¬† ""Okay. I've got a visual on her now. Continue. ""  
  
¬† ""One of Rome's contacts intercepted a communication between her and some as yet unknown man and learned some stuff we didn't know. Like how Pretty Boy, her former boss - you know, the evil guy Rome and I had to kill during our courtship - had several warehouses filled with people he'd locked up and experimented on. Desert Gall moved them to a central location to test them and weed out the weaklings, and Rome went to save them. But knowing Pretty Boy, and having studied Desert Gal, there were a few booby traps along the way. "" Just saying those two words - Pretty Boy - caused me to shudder. And I'd said them twice. Double shudder.  
  
¬† He'd been the most beautiful man I'd ever seen, lushly sensual, darkly erotic, yet he'd possessed a black, monstrous heart. He'd tried to experiment on me, too, as well as attempting to kill Rome. He had experimented on others - the ones we'd known about before his death - replacing their skin with impenetrable metal, adding animal glands to their brains so they'd have beastlike instincts. He'd done other stuff, too. Stuff I couldn't even consider without gagging. All to build an army. An army that would bring him money and (more) power.  
  
¬† Tres cliche if you asked me.  
  
¬† Sherridan leaned forward, clearly intrigued. The book fell to her feet, a warrior's bright eyes staring up at me. ""There were survivors?"" she asked. ""I thought all the people Pretty Boy tampered with ended up dying. Even the ones you guys rescued from those cages. ""  
  
¬† ""They did. Well, those did. Like I said, he had other warehouses, more people. Apparently these groups not only survived, they've begun to thrive. Rome was to bring them to PSI for questioning and testing.  
  
¬† John wants to do a little recruiting of his own, I'm sure. ""  
  
¬† ""Wow, experiments that actually worked,"" she said reverently, her blue eyes glazing over. Then her features softened, and her mouth parted on a dreamy sigh.  
  
¬† Her mind was wandering.  
  
¬† What, she wanted to be experimented on? I shook my head and had to hook several strands of my honey-colored hair behind my ears to keep them from slapping my cheeks. ""Sherridan. "" No response.  
  
¬† I rubbed my temples and closed my eyes for a moment. If I knew my friend, and I think I did, since we'd been friends for years, she'd just entered her Happy Place. She would be there for half an hour, at least. Trying to engage her now would be pointless.  
  
¬† Ever since Sherridan had learned about my abilities, she'd been acting strangely, retreating more and more into her mind. Oh, she still loved me. That wasn't in question. And I knew she didn't fear me. If she asked me to blow-dry her hair from fifty paces one more time, I was going to strangle her. But there was something almost. . . depressed about her, as though her life now lacked excitement and adventure.  
  
¬† I knew that feeling.  
  
¬† There were people in the world with beauty, riches, power. Their every step seemed blessed; failure and rejection were not things they'd ever experienced. Excitement greeted them everywhere they went, danger was something to be laughed at and anything they desired, they could have. In their hands, they held the power to change the world. At one time, I would have killed for such a life. Now, I have killed for it, but it wasn't the charmed existence I'd once thought it would be.  
  
¬† Perhaps I should have known such gifts would come with a price. But all I'd seen was the glitz, the glamour. The exhilaration. I hadn't known that there would always be a thousand others willing to rip me apart to possess what I have.  
  
¬† I prayed Sherridan didn't desire what I had desired - what I had gotten. This power beyond imagining. I prayed she was smarter.  
  
¬† Behind me, I heard a door creak open. Close. Footsteps.  
  
¬† I twisted. A slump-shouldered Tanner was strolling down the hall. I worried over the change in his appearance. He wore black as usual, but in the past his clothes had always been clean. Now his dark attire was dirty and wrinkled, his azure hair unwashed and in spikes around his head. He looked terrible.  
  
¬† There were bruises under his eyes and lines of tension around his mouth. He'd even taken out his signature eyebrow ring and Eight Ball contacts.  
  
¬† I'd known and loved him for several months, and I hated seeing him like this. He was tall and when I'd first met him he'd been extremely lean, more boy than man. But he'd begun to fill out and muscle up, coming into his own in both command and confidence. This past week, though, he'd started to slim down again, as if he didn't have the will to eat.  
  
¬† ""Hey, Crazy Bones,"" I said. It was my pet name for him.  
  
¬† Usually he grinned. Now he stopped a few feet away from me and peered down at Sherridan as if I hadn't spoken. ""Happy Place?"" he asked.  
  
¬† I nodded, my heart lurching at the sadness in his tone.  
  
¬† ""She's weird. ""  
  
¬† ""Tanner,"" I said, then stopped when he faced me. My heart gave another lurch. God, his eyes. Once a bright blue (when he didn't disguise them with those crazily patterned contact lenses), they were now dull and listless and swimming with misery. They wer  
e dark and dismal. Hopeless.  
  
¬† In that moment, I hated Lexis. Tanner was the brother I'd never had, hadn't known I'd wanted and needed, and couldn't live without. I couldn't stand seeing him like this.  
  
¬† ""Don't,"" he said. His jaw tightened. ""Just don't. ""  
  
¬† ""Don't what?"" I asked, even though I knew what he meant. I just wanted to draw him out of his miserable shell.  
  
¬† ""Don't feel sorry for me. "" He moved forward, brushing me aside with his shoulder.  
  
¬† I remained in place, a little stunned. He hadn't made a single derogatory comment about my breasts or tried to cop a feel. Even when death had been breathing down our necks, he'd been unable to go five minutes without talking about my nipples.  
  
¬† Okay, so maybe ""brother"" wasn't the best word to describe him. He was the boyfriend I adored but wouldn't sleep with. Wait. No, that didn't work, either. Whatever he was, I loved him. Plain and simple.  
  
¬† ""Tanner, I don't feel sorry for you,"" I called, bypassing our air purifier and following him into the kitchen.  
  
¬† Because my abilities were so attuned to nature, toxins were my greatest enemy now, so there was another air purifier in the kitchen. Another in my bedroom. Another in the hallway.  
  
¬† Tanner was digging inside the fridge. Bottles clinked together; something thumped from the top shelf.  
  
¬† ""Doesn't matter. I don't want to talk about her. ""  
  
¬† ""You need to, because it's festering inside you. You're falling apart and - ""  
  
¬† ""Hey, which of us is the master of emotions here? Besides, I know what you're going to say. You've been here, done that. Yeah, I know. Only difference is, you got a happily ever after. I won't. ""  
  
¬† ""She was your first love, but there will be others. You'll see. Just give it time. You'll get over her and someone else will catch your eye. ""  
  
¬† Every muscle in his body stiffened, but he didn't face me. ""So what you're telling me is that if Rome didn't want you, you'd be okay with finding someone else?""  
  
¬† No. Never. Rome was it for me. The one and only. My man. I couldn't even imagine myself with someone else. Poor Tanner, I thought again. Had he really loved Lexis like that?  
  
¬† ""Why did she end things?"" I asked softly.  
  
¬† Silent, he straightened. He was holding a beer, staring down at it.  
  
¬† ""Uh, you're not twenty-one,"" I pointed out, just to break the quiet tension.  
  
¬† Finally he flicked me a glance. ""Feel free to turn me in. "" He popped the cap and leaned back, the rim suddenly at his lips. In record time, he drained the contents of the bottle, tossed it into the trash and reached for another.  
  
¬† ""No, I meant, you're not twenty-one so you shouldn't be drinking without a responsible adult drinking with you. Toss me one. ""  
  
¬† That earned me a grin. Swift, but there for that brief moment all the same. I felt as if I'd conquered the world. And I hadn't even had to use my powers! ""Like you're responsible,"" he said.  
  
¬† ""Well, I am an adult. ""  
  
¬† ""That's debatable, too. "" He tossed me a beer.  
  
¬† My reflexes were not as defined as my paranormal abilities, and I almost dropped it, the condensation making it slick. I had to clasp it with two hands to maintain a firm enough grip.  
  
¬† ""Already had one?"" he asked.  
  
¬† I looked drunk? This early in the morning? ""I'm not belting out show tunes, so no. "" With a flick of his wrist, Tanner closed the fridge and faced me fully. I settled atop one of the bar stools, sipping at the beer. Ick. Not my alcoholic beverage of choice, especially for breakfast, but it would do.  
  
¬† Anything for Tanner. ""Talk to me. Please. I'm worried about you. "" He shrugged, his eyes once again swirling with more misery than any one person should have to deal with. ""Nothing to tell, really. We got together because she needed someone to comfort her and I needed a willing body to lose my virginity to. ""  
  
¬† ""And did you?""  
  
¬† One of his black brows arched. ""None of your business. ""  
  
¬† Did that mean no? The Tanner I knew liked to kiss and tell and besides that, they'd seemed so hot and heavy. PDA was not something they'd eschewed.  
  
¬† He drained the second beer as quickly as the first, then closed his eyes and pressed the dripping bottle against his chest. Once, twice, he banged his head against the refrigerator, saying, ""She told me she knew we weren't meant to be together. That something was going to happen, and one day I'd realize it. "" He laughed bitterly. ""She said I'd even thank her. ""  
  
¬† Oh, crap. Lexis's predictions were never wrong. That didn't lessen the sting of the here and now, though. I knew that well. Long ago, Lexis had dumped Rome because she'd known deep down she wasn't the woman of his heart, wasn't his one and only. She'd known he would stay with her anyway because he was the father of their child. She'd known, and it had broken her. So she'd cut him loose.  
  
¬† Just like she'd cut Tanner loose.  
  
¬† Was Tanner destined to love someone else?  
  
¬† Suddenly I didn't hate Lexis quite so much.  
  
¬† She'd told me once that she didn't know if I was Rome's one and only, either, that she'd had a vision of that girl but had never seen her face. A lot of days I could pretend that didn't bother me. Most days, in fact. Sometimes in the early morning, though, when I was alone in bed, too sleepy to block my fears, I would wonder if some girl was out there, soon to meet Rome - soon to enthrall him, steal his affections.  
  
¬† But then I would wake up and remind myself that Rome was not a man easily swayed. He loved me. He wanted forever with me or he wouldn't have asked me to marry him.  
  
¬† Tanner's eyelids cracked open, his features now covered with an expressionless mask, his gaze empty and his jaw relaxed. ""She also said her true love would be coming back into her life. "" His voice was devoid of emotion, as well.  
  
¬† Okay. I hated her again. Her true love? Her true love would be coming back to her? Last time I'd spoken with her, she had (mistakenly) thought her true love was Rome. So what the hell had she meant by true love? There had better be someone else she considered her true love, someone else from her past, or I would extract her intestines and use them to choke her.  
  
¬† A knock sounded at the door.  
  
¬† I didn't move, too keyed up from my rush of anger. Rome and Tanner were more important to me than breathing, and that bitch had better -  
  
¬† Another knock, this one harder, more insistent.  
  
¬† ""You should get that, 'cause damn,"" Tanner said, ""you're about to light the house on fire and I don't need to add homelessness to my plate-o-shit. Besides, your visitor might be John with the lowdown on Rome. ""  
  
¬† The one thing sure to push me into action. My fury drained. ""Don't move. I'll get the 411, get rid of whoever it is - "" hopefully without too much of an emotional outburst, whatever the news, which had better be good "" - and we'll finish our discussion. You matter to me, and we're going to figure this thing with Lexis out. "" And then I'm going to hunt her down and demand some answers Belle-style.  
  
¬† Uh-oh. There was my anger again.  
  
¬† Tanner shrugged, but I could see the spark of hope suddenly lighting his eyes. He trusted me to help make things better, and that made me doubly determined to do so.  
  
¬† As yet another knock echoed, I rushed to him and hugged him tight. Then I raced out of the kitchen and past the still-entranced Sherridan, not stopping until I reached the door.  
  
¬† I glanced through the peephole. The moment I saw who waited on the porch, my hands curled into fists, plumes of dark smoke suddenly wafting from my nose. Red dotted my vision like fireworks on the Fourth of July. Well, well, well.  
  
¬† Speak of the devil and she would appear.

Chapter Two  
  
¬†  
  
¬† My jaw was like stoneas I punched in the security code to disable the alarm and opened the door.  
  
¬† Lexis stood before me, a vision of feminine beauty as always. Long dark hair, straight as a pin. Hypnotic green eyes, pretty pink lips. Golden skin that defined the word perfection. Sunlight bathed her, seeping from the sky as if compelled to caress her.  
  
¬† Behind her, cars meandered through the pristine neighborhood. Birds chirped from the blue sky and locusts rattled in a surprisingly sensual beat. Intense humidity and heat wafted my way. I, of course, began to sweat like a construction worker while Lexis continued to appear unaffected, her silky emerald suit completely dry.  
  
¬† ""What are you doing here?"" I demanded, thinking, Somehow, someway, I'm taking you down.  
  
¬† Smelling like an ancient garden, all flowers and magic, she tried to stride past me. My arm and leg whipped out, blocking her path. After an indelicate humph, she glared up at me. I was taller than she was, nah nah nah. A girl had to find joy where she could.  
  
¬† ""Let me in, Belle,"" she snapped.  
  
¬† Usually she was poised, nothing able to ruffle her. Score one for me. ""No,"" I snapped back. A tiny flame flickered at the end of my index finger, and I whisked it behind my back. Wouldn't be good form to fry her up before I'd obtained answers. ""What do you want?"" She squared her delicate shoulders, looked away from me. ""I need to talk to you. ""  
  
¬† ""Uh, that would be a no. Tanner's here. Which means you're not welcome anymore. "" Her features softened and her eyes widened, regret churning in their depths. ""This is important. ""  
  
¬† ""He's more important than anything you've got to say,"" I said, still not allowing her inside. ""By the way, where's Sunny?""  
  
¬† ""My brother-in-law has her. ""  
  
¬† ""Former brother-in-law. "" Bitch. ""You're divorced. "" Sunny was Rome's little girl, his pride and joy, and we watched (and pampered) her every weekend. Today was a weekday, but anytime Lexis was called away to work we happily took over Sunny's care early. I loved that child like she was my own.  
  
¬† Lexis's gaze met mine in a heated clash. ""I'm here about Rome. Something's happened. "" Magic words. I moved aside. Fear instantly cascaded through me, dousing the heat of my anger, freezing and thickening every drop of blood in my veins. Mist formed in front of my nose with every exhalation I made.  
  
¬† Lexis strode inside. I had to fight past the tightness in my joints to follow her. My movements were slow, forced. Something's happened, but that doesn't mean Rome's hurt. Calm down!  
  
¬† She stopped in the center of the living room, breathed deeply - to catch Rome's lingering wild scent? - and glanced at Sherridan, who was still sitting on the couch with a blank expression. ""Happy Place?"" she asked, turning to face me.  
  
¬† I nodded. There was a hard lump in my throat, and I was having trouble swallowing. He's fine.  
  
¬† Lexis returned her attention to my friend, shock flashing over her features, there one moment, gone the next. Then she was shaking her head, a little sad. ""Her greatest wish is going to come true, and she's going to hate herself for it. ""  
  
¬† ""What do you mean?"" I asked, finally finding my voice. ""What wish?"" As I spoke, I prayed it wasn't what I'd suspected earlier. Sherridan had a thriving real estate business, a date with a new, sexy man every weekend and me as a best bud. She didn't need anything else.  
  
¬† From the corner of my eye, I saw a flash of black. Oh, no. Everything else was forgotten as I focused on Tanner. He stood in the doorway between the kitchen and the living room. He leaned against the wall, his arms crossed over his chest, his eyes anywhere but Lexis.  
  
¬† Lexis noticed him, too, and gulped, sadness skating over her expression a second time only to be replaced by determination. ""Tanner,"" she acknowledged softly.  
  
¬† He gave a stiff nod and said, ""S'up,"" as if he hadn't a care.  
  
¬† ""I just. . . I - "" Sighing, she turned away from him, giving him her back.  
  
¬† Hurt flashed over Tanner's face, and then his jaw hardened, his eyelids narrowed. So badly I wanted to shake Little Miss Know-It-All until she passed out.  
  
¬† ""What's wrong with Rome?"" I asked. ""Tell me and get out. ""  
  
¬† ""Something's wrong with Rome?"" Tanner was at my side, his arm around my waist and offering support within seconds.  
  
¬† Needing every ounce of strength he could give me, I rested my head on his shoulder.  
  
¬† He shivered. ""Damn, you're cold,"" he said, and I knew he meant it literally. ""Deep breaths, Viper. "" Viper, his pet name for me. ""Good, that's good, but you're not calming. "" Lexis watched us with a hint of longing. Exactly what was she longing for? A partnership like Tanner and I had? Well, she'd destroyed her chance. More than that, Team TannaBelle wasn't accepting new members. Except for Rome. I needed him, too. Like I'd said, he was my filter. He could take my emotions and cage them inside his body, removing the edge, the danger.  
  
¬† Was he okay? Had he been hurt?  
  
¬† A crystallized raindrop dripped from the ceiling, my fear and sadness too much. It spilled out of me and would soon consume the entire house if I wasn't careful.  
  
¬† ""Tell me what's going on,"" I managed to croak.  
  
¬† That emerald gaze slid from my face to the hands twisting at my T-shirt - to the engagement ring glittering on my finger, a flat, fire-retardant titanium band with diamonds encrusted in the center. It was exactly what I would have picked for myself. Rome knew my likes, my dislikes and had known that anything similar to the five-carat rock he'd given Lexis would have irritated me.  
  
¬† Delicate mist formed in front of Lexis's face as she breathed. ""Something went wrong. I - He - "" Oh my God. ""What! Just say it!""  
  
¬† Tanner squeezed my side as another crystallized droplet fell, shattering when it hit the wooden floor.  
  
¬† In, out, I breathed. In, out. I was shaking uncontrollably.  
  
¬† ""He and Cody made it into the warehouse and fought the guards posted there. It was more of a battle than they'd anticipated. Desert Gal, who wasn't there at the time, had taken over OASS, as we suspected, and had already fortified all their defenses, as we did not. Still, they managed to beat the guards and free the prisoners. "" Her voice shook. ""Then one of those prisoners. . . attacked Rome. ""  
  
¬† ""Is he okay? Is he - "" I still couldn't bring myself to say it. Tanner began shaking, too.  
  
¬† ""He's alive,"" Lexis said.  
  
¬† Thank God. Relief poured through me, palpable, heady. My eyelids closed, and my knees would have buckled if Tanner hadn't been holding me up. The ice inside me started to melt and the ceiling ceased its weeping. ""I should kill you for scaring me like that. ""  
  
¬† ""You didn't let me finish,"" was the hard reply.  
  
¬† My eyelids popped open, and the ice immediately returned. ""Finish, then! Tell me everything. Right.  
  
¬† Now! I'm fighting for control here, and you're only making it worse. "" She nodded, grim, and that quick acquiescence made me all the more uneasy. ""During the fight, his opponent disappeared. Inside him,"" she added grimly. ""The man disappeared inside him. It did something to him, something bad. ""  
  
¬† I shook my head, hair slapping my cheeks but not managing to abate my confusion. ""How is that possible? That's not - ""  
  
¬† She laughed bitterly, cutting me off. ""Anything is possible. You should know that by now. "" I did. Oh, God, I did. ""Is the man still. . . "" And if so, what did that mean? I'd only known about this supernatural side of life a few months. I'd been thrust into it unexpectedly, utterly unprepared and, at first, disbelieving. In so many ways, I was still a baby.  
  
¬† ""No. He only stayed inside of Rome a few minutes, and then he exited Rome's body as if nothing strange had happened. Cody tried to capture him, but the man stepped inside of him, too, before escaping. Both Cody and Rome collapsed, but Cody was the first to awaken. He gathered Rome and the remaining experiment victims and returned to PSI headquarters. They arrived this morning. Rome is still unconscious. ""  
  
¬† Shock was once again beating through me. I should have been there. I could have helped him, could have erected an air shield while he worked and kept him safe. But I hadn't gone; I'd been too preoccupied w  
ith planning my wedding. Guilt joined the shock, followed quickly by shame.  
  
¬† ""John should have told me,"" I said softly. Why hadn't he? He'd had the opportunity. Knowing him, though, he'd probably wanted concrete answers - how, why, lasting effects - before freaking me out.  
  
¬† ""He didn't even call me. I only know because I saw it. . . last night in my. . . dreams. "" Why the hesitation? ""You see the future, not the past. "" Hope filled me. ""Maybe it hasn't happened yet.  
  
¬† Maybe we can stop - ""  
  
¬† She was shaking her head, grimmer than I'd ever seen her, dashing every bit of my hope. ""I know my visions. This has already happened. ""  
  
¬† That struck me as odd, but I was too crazed at the moment to reason it out.  
  
¬† Tanner gave me a little shove toward the hallway. ""He's going to be fine. Change out of your pj's and get your stuff. I'll take you up there. ""  
  
¬† An hour later , I found myself standing outside of Rome's recovery room in PSI headquarters. I'd been beside his bed, but my grief had gotten the better of me and ice tears had once again begun falling from the ceiling, so I'd been asked to leave. Now I was looking at the love of my life through a glass partition.  
  
¬† He lay motionless, his dark hair in disarray. His features were smooth, as if he were merely sleeping, at peace and healthy and dreaming of love and heart-pounding sex. Perhaps the last was wishful thinking.  
  
¬† Long black lashes feathered over his sharp cheekbones. I wanted to trace the shadows they cast, the slope of his nose. His lips were soft and parted. I'd kissed those lips. Those lips had kissed every inch of me.  
  
¬† He hadn't lost any weight. His body was still tanned, primed and roped. Pure strength, total vitality. The only evidence that something was wrong was the electrodes scattered all over his torso. On the monitor, his heartbeat appeared steady and sure.  
  
¬† Lexis stood beside the bed, clasping his hand. Tears were sliding down her cheeks and dripping onto his bare chest. They should have been my tears. I should have been the one holding his hand.  
  
¬† Right then, I hated my powers.  
  
¬† Tanner was in the waiting room with Sherridan, who had yet to exit her Happy Place. How I envied her.  
  
¬† Rome was my Happy Place, but I couldn't get to him. And I couldn't leave to give them an update.  
  
¬† Approaching Rome was too dangerous, but I refused to move from this spot. When he awoke, he would need me. By then, I would be calm.  
  
¬† Really?Several ice crystals splattered atop my head. Hand shaky, I brushed them off. Stupid fear.  
  
¬† Several more instantly took their place, but I didn't bother with them. Until I did that pesky calming thing, they wouldn't stop falling.  
  
¬† ""Belle. ""  
  
¬† I felt the heat and zap of Cody's body as he approached me, and then I caught the scent of a wild storm. Familiar, but not as comforting as it should have been. I didn't turn. My gaze was still locked on Rome. My Rome. Lying there, so helpless. Even with all my powers, there was nothing I could do to help him right now. None of the doctors knew what was wrong or why they couldn't rouse him.  
  
¬† ""What happened?"" I asked Cody softly. He and Rome were friends. They worked together, trusted each other. He would tell me the truth - no matter how much it hurt.  
  
¬† ""I honestly don't know. ""  
  
¬† Or maybe not. ""If you're saying that because you think the truth will cause me to break down - ""  
  
¬† ""Nothing like that, believe me. "" He laughed, but there was a hard edge to the sound. ""If I knew, I'd tell you. But it's like a piece of my brain is missing, my memories of the event gone. All I know is that I saw Rome open one of the cages and then he was unconscious on the ground. Next thing I knew, I was on the ground myself and crawling to get to him. Had Lexis not told me about the man entering our bodies, I would have no knowledge of it whatsoever. ""  
  
¬† ""He's going to be okay,"" I said, more for my benefit than his.  
  
¬† ""Yes. He's strong. A fighter. Remember when our old friend Pretty Boy plugged him full of poisoned bullets? He lived through that, thanks to you, and even helped end the son of a bitch, so he can live through anything. ""  
  
¬† My hands fisted at my sides, tongues of fire suddenly licking at my skin and melting the ice. ""I'm going to capture the bastard who hurt him. ""  
  
¬† ""It will be my pleasure to help you. ""  
  
¬† ""Thank you. "" I'd take any help I could get. ""I doubt John will balk. The guy who attacked you and Rome is linked to Desert Gal, since she's the one who rounded up all of Pretty Boy's experiments, so technically his case should be mine, anyway. "" God. This might not have happened if I'd taken care of her already. She wouldn't have gathered those people, that horrible body-entering man, and Rome wouldn't have gone to that warehouse. ""As soon as Rome wakes up, I'm hunting them both. "" No longer would I be lax in my duties.  
  
¬† ""I'll be ready,"" Cody said. ""From what I hear, Desert Gall is worse than Pretty Boy. More coldhearted, hungrier for power, with no perceivable weakness. ""  
  
¬† Didn't matter. I would not fail. Not again. ""I'm going to request Tanner and Lexis as backup. "" The two might not get along, and Lexis might not be my favorite person right now, but they were amazing agents.  
  
¬† If anyone could help me find and destroy my fiance's tormentors, they could.  
  
¬† ""The bastard is going to suffer,"" I said with determination.  
  
¬† ""Belle,"" Cody said gently.  
  
¬† ""Yes?""  
  
¬† ""Look at me. ""  
  
¬† And away from Rome? ""No, I - ""  
  
¬† ""Please. ""  
  
¬† When a strong, dominant man said please, it was best to give in unless you wanted six-foot-four of solid muscle breathing down your neck. Something I knew firsthand from Rome. I'd delighted in refusing him, and he'd delighted in changing my mind.

1mxftmu,https://i.redd.it/7wyyu9o8gmkf1.png,Passed step 1 with too many breaks in my prep,"I was a lurker in this group before my exam, this subreddit helped me in so many ways so I'm sharing my exam experience in case someone is in same boat as i was. I had so many breaks in my prep, it took me two years to actually get it done with and it goes without saying if i can do it, literally anyone can do this
I passed the exam I was terrified of. Honestly, I had never felt this much fear from any exam. I was an average student throughout medical school, and taking a year-long break in my preparation made things even more difficult. Anyways, here are my two cents on the matter.

Background
I started UWorld in my final year and completed about 80% before my house job started.
I finished the remaining 20% during my house job, but then I didn‚Äôt study at all for a year.
During that break, I got married. The adjustment process was smooth, but I lost the temperament to study.

Restarting Prep
Around November 2024, I started UWorld again (random mode) and also did about 20% Amboss.
My scores at that stage:
NBME 26 ‚Üí 56%
NBME 28 ‚Üí 57% 

(These two nbmes, took them 15 days apart without reviewing any study material, this score really humbled me and I realized I couldn‚Äôt just wing it, so I sat down, analyzed my mistakes, and  reviewed FA, Mehlman PDFs, Sketchy, and Pathoma(1-3 chapters))
Mehlman pdfs are GOLD tbh. I did these twice (neuroanatomy, risk factors, arrows) once at the start of dedicated period and then 10 days before exam. 
Also did for msk, renal, repro, cvs, git. 

Score Progression
NBME 27 ‚Üí 63%
NBME 29 ‚Üí 70%
NBME 30 ‚Üí 73%
UWSA 1 ‚Üí 61%
UWSA 2 ‚Üí 66%
UWSA 3 (20 days before exam) ‚Üí 63% (This score crushed my morale, but since UWSAs aren‚Äôt very predictive, I took them more as extra practice questions.)
NBME 31 (15 days before exam) ‚Üí 78%
Free 120 (1 week before exam) ‚Üí 76%

What Helped Me Improve
While doing NBMEs and practice questions, the biggest thing that helped was making a list of concepts where I felt I was only guessing. I worked on those along with my wrongs.

I consistently did 40‚Äì60 practice questions daily (UWorld/Amboss) and reviewed only the wrongs. Do not stop attempting questions during nbmes or in dedicated because you can easily get out of practice. If you do not have time i know it can become exhausting at the end to do all things together, then you can only attempt blocks and skip review.  

Timing was never an issue‚ÄîI usually finished NBMEs with 8-10 minutes to spare. My main weakness was knowledge gaps, and Mehlman PDFs helped a lot. 

Exam Day Experience
I took a sleep aid the night before and managed to sleep almost 12 hours :) (only take these if you have previously taken it and you are 100% sure it won't make you dizzy the next day)

I did the first two blocks without a break, then took short 5‚Äì7 minute breaks after every block and ate protein snacks and coffee.
Throughout the exam, I kept pep-talking myself: ‚Äúim only doing an nbme and Whatever happens, I won‚Äôt get discouraged‚ÄîI‚Äôll just keep pushing.‚Äù
The exam felt doable. Yes, stems were long, but there were plenty of clues you could use to reach the right diagnosis. It felt very close to nbme 31 and free 120.
Content-wise, I got many ECGs, risk factor questions, radiographs, and each block was heavily packed with micro and immunology, thank god no media questions were there. 

My Advice
This exam tests not just knowledge but also confidence and nerves.
You need to have a good support system.
Eat well and take regular short breaks. 
There is so much fear associated with steps that it really becomes tricky to calm you nerves, so you have to keep reminding yourself that it's only an exam. 
Many people do not take nbmes seriously, please don't repeat my mistakes and don't waste your nbmes, attempt these properly, simulate your exam experience. Practice questions, make a list of weak topics, work on those.

1mxfmfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToyotaGrandHighlander/comments/1mxfmfd/things_i_learned_changing_my_2025_ghh_limited_oil/,Things I learned changing my 2025 GHH Limited oil,"You will need 5 quarts of 0-w8 oil.  Maybe a little less, maybe a little more.  Google will tell you that you need 0-w16.  If you buy 0-w16 Mobil 1 from Walmart, Brad will not let you return it, even if the metal seal under the cap isn't broken.  Brad's a jerk.  Buy 0-w8 the first time and avoid Brad by checking out in the auto department.

0-w8 oil is both thinner and lighter than my morning coffee.  (I like my oil like I like my women - pale and without viscosity.)

You will need a 90915-YZZN1 OEM oil filter.  Walmart sells these for 5 bucks.  Don't try to save eleven cents by buying the Fram or STP filter.  The Toyota filter is better because it says Toyota on it.  That thing will last for 500,000 miles. (The car, not the filter)

You will need a 10mm socket or a Phillips head screwdriver to remove the jigsaw puzzle piece that covers your oil drain and filter.  There are 4 screws.

You may need to remove all the other jigsaw puzzle pieces after you drop your oil cap into the engine compartment and it doesn't reach the ground.  No?  Just me?  Whatever.

You will need a 15mm socket to remove the oil plug.  You'll only need this on your first oil change, because you'll replace it with a Fumoto valve and never have to worry about it again.   Trust me on this.

The oil filter sits horizontal to the ground.  It is possible to remove the oil filter without spilling oil all over your driveway.  If you feel this is beyond you, call your dad for help.

If you don't want to call dad, the blue shop towels you buy in the auto department work much better than regular paper towels on oil spills. Totally worth the cost.

Of all my Toyotas, this was not the easiest oil change I've done, but a very close second.  Start to finish 12 minutes, including cleanup (not including the second trip to Walmart and the quality time I spent with Brad).

For a better idea of myself:



* I enjoy gaming, but that's mainly indoors, and I'd like to be outdoors in the vitamin D-rich SUN and feel the HEAT all over me.
* I currently do no play sports but I have done rock climbing in the past. I haven't done so in 2 months due to my being out of shape, but the last time I did it with efficiency was in 2024. I want to get into a sport, but rock climbing is where it's at. I AM also interested in BJJ again after a 2-year hiatus, but that will take more time to get into, haha. 
* I LOVE books. I enjoy reading horror novels, science fiction, fantasy, and self-help books. If there are nice spots downtown that are good for readers, a nice suggestion would be in order :D
* I am an artist. I enjoy sketching people, sketching places, etc. If there's a cafe that's really conducive to sketching AND has really good coffee, I'd be so down to visit there!
* I'm not a big events person. I'm very shy and I don't have anyone to go to to break the social ice. I don't like to be around a lot of people because I have social anxiety. But I would like to go to a very easy-going event if possible.
* I like museums, art galleries, and art in general. Feel free to recommend me one that's not AGO or ROM :)

1mxfj8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mxfj8g/could_the_toddy_cold_brew_system_be_the_ultimate/,Could the Toddy Cold Brew System be the ultimate coffee maker review you need?,"Using the Toddy THM Cold Brew System for my daily caffeine needs has been quite the rewarding journey. As a self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast, cold brews are my staple, and this product just had to be explored. With the promise of a manual coffee infuser that brews rich, smooth coffee, I was intrigued from the get-go. Testing this device over the past few weeks has been an enriching experience, and while it does deliver on a lot of its claims, a few quirks stood out too.

**Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment the package arrived, the simple yet functional design caught my eye. The white finish gives the product a clean, minimalist vibe that complements any kitchen decor. It‚Äôs compact, measuring just 7.25"" wide and 12.5"" tall, which is great for smaller countertops. Additionally, its lightweight nature (just over 1.5 pounds) makes it easy to handle and store. Despite its lightweight feel, the materials seem sturdy enough for long-term use. Though primarily made of plastic, the inclusion of a glass decanter was a pleasant surprise. I particularly appreciated the no-nonsense construction‚Äîa brewing container with a handle, a glass decanter with a secure lid, and a rubber stopper, all aimed at simplifying the brewing process.

**Ease of Use and Operation**  
This coffee infuser thrives on simplicity. Being a fully manual system, it offers a precise and hands-on brewing experience. Setting it up was easy, even for someone like me who typically glosses over instruction manuals. However, I did find myself consulting the recipe guide included in the package, which was a lifesaver when experimenting with coffee-to-water ratios. There‚Äôs something satisfying about having that level of control over your brew. The reusable filters make for an environmentally friendlier option, and they perform well in keeping out most grounds that could ruin a good cold brew. The rubber stopper takes some getting used to, but once I mastered it, there were no leaks or spills.  

**Check Toddy THM Cold Brew System price on Amazon.**  

**Flavor and Performance**  
Truthfully, the taste this system produces is on another level. Cold brews made using this method emerge flavorful, rich, and non-acidic. For regular users of other cold brew methods, this could be a game-changer. I‚Äôve tried making both coffee and tea, and each offering consistently delivered smooth results. What‚Äôs remarkable is the system‚Äôs ability to extract nuanced flavors, especially from high-quality beans. The reusable filters do a great job of producing a clean cup, though finer grinds can sometimes sneak their way into the brew‚Äîan issue I noticed after about five uses. Despite that, the performance justifies why this device has so many rave recommendations online.  

**Highlights**  
- Minimalist design with solid build quality.  
- Simple manual operation that offers great control over brewing.  
- Produces smooth, rich, low-acid cold brews.  
- Environmentally friendly reusable filters.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The rubber stopper‚Äôs learning curve can frustrate new users.  
- Some finer grounds occasionally bypass the filters.  
- Glass decanter, while sleek, feels fragile and could benefit from thicker glass.  

**Alternative Products**  
In comparison to popular alternatives, this cold brew system holds its own. Versus the OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Maker, the Toddy system excels in compactness and simplicity but may lose out on the robustness of filter performance. While the Hario Mizudashi provides a cheaper alternative, the Toddy system delivers a more professional taste experience, ideal for users aiming for caf√©-level results at home. That said, for those wanting more versatility, like hot and cold brewing in one apparatus, devices like the Takeya Cold Brew Maker might be preferable. However, few options match the nuanced flavor output I‚Äôve achieved with this one.

**Smart Spending**  
Looking at the range of features packed into this cold brew system, the price point seems fair. While some alternatives might appear more economical at first glance, the quality of coffee and the eco-conscious design of this system make it worth the investment. Over time, the reusable filters add to its cost-efficiency, saving you from buying paper filters repeatedly. For coffee enthusiasts seeking long-term reliability, this could be a smart buy.

Sure, Yuki laughed before, but I don't remember seeing her laugh since then. Did she laugh only once by chance?

else.
No, maybe she had a point. When the instructors showed their anger, most of it was directed at someone
Smiles are also directed to someone else.
It wasn‚Äôt hard to understand.
I looked at Yuki.
‚Äú...What?‚Äù
I tried to smile.
As I thought, I didn't know how to smile.


Y2v10 


‚ÄúHuh? So, what‚Äôs wrong with that?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that I feel like I‚Äôve never seen that expression on your face in the two years‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúHow rude. I‚Äôm not a baby who‚Äôs just learned to smile.‚Äù
I‚Äôve been told something similar before, and there have been many times I‚Äôve made a conscious effort to smile. It shouldn‚Äôt be that rare. Well‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, it might‚Äôve been a rare moment.‚Äù

At that instant, I couldn‚Äôt recall at all making a conscious effort to smile. The expression of an unintentional emotion.
How many such experiences have I had so far?

Neither an act nor a reading of the atmosphere, but just being natural. From understanding how difficult that was, it became interesting. It felt like a drop of color had been added to a blank sketchbook.

Not in front of Kei, nor in front of a friend like Y≈çsuke. I didn‚Äôt know why that expression appeared in front of Horikita.

‚ÄúI wonder why I smiled. Would you know if you were the one who smiled?‚Äù

I had hoped that Horikita would have a clear answer. I asked if it was a funny scene, looking into her eyes. But Horikita averted her gaze and hurriedly replied.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt know either if you asked me with such a serious face.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo, it‚Äôs not that something particularly funny happened, right?‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶As I said, I wouldn‚Äôt know even if you asked me.‚Äù

Horikita, who had turned aside, slightly raised her voice and sighed.
‚ÄúBecause of your strange thinking, I feel like a fool for laughing as well‚Ä¶‚Äù

Horikita gulped down the remainder of her coffee and stood up.
‚ÄúAre we done talking? I have plans, so I should be going.‚Äù
‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say you had no plans?‚Äù
‚ÄúI just remembered I had plans.‚Äù

She then picked up the empty cup she had drunk



>Back in V0, Kiyotaka is still trying to make sense of emotions like laughter and smiling. Yuki tells him:

	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but I think I can laugh again when I‚Äôm around you, Kiyotaka.‚Äù

To her, it‚Äôs natural you can laugh or smile because of who you‚Äôre with, because certain people bring that out of you. But to Kiyo, it‚Äôs incomprehensible. He wonders if emotions really only spark when you‚Äôre with a specific person. He even tries to force a smile himself, but he admits: ‚ÄúAs I thought, I didn‚Äôt know how to smile.‚Äù That‚Äôs the level of disconnect he had with emotions then.

Fast forward to Y2V10, and suddenly‚Ä¶ it happens. Horikita catches him smiling naturally, in a way even he didn‚Äôt realize. He immediately reflects on it and notices the difference: this wasn‚Äôt a conscious act or performance‚Äîit was the expression of a genuine, unintentional emotion. And what‚Äôs even more telling? It didn‚Äôt happen with Kei, or with Y≈çsuke. It happened with Horikita.

That‚Äôs why he asks her:

	‚ÄúI wonder why I smiled. Would you know if you were the one who smiled?‚Äù
I had hoped that Horikita would have a clear answer

And here‚Äôs the key link back in V0, when he questioned this same phenomenon, Yuki gave him an answer: ‚ÄúI can laugh again when I‚Äôm around you.‚Äù That was her truth. Now, years later, he‚Äôs essentially asking Horikita if she sees the same truth he couldn‚Äôt accept before.

Was he expecting her to say something like Yuki did? Maybe, deep down, he was. That‚Äôs why he hoped for a ‚Äúclear answer‚Äù from her, why he looked her in the eyes and pressed her about it. It‚Äôs like a subconscious repetition of that old scene, but this time with someone who matters to him now.

The tragedy and tension is that Horikita can‚Äôt give him that answer not because it isn‚Äôt true, but because she‚Äôs not ready to admit it, even to herself. She avoids his gaze, deflects the question, and runs away from the moment. So instead of closure, Kiyo is left with the same unanswered puzzle: do these emotions only exist because of the people we‚Äôre with?

The connection between the two scenes shows his growth but also his lingering void. In V0 he couldn‚Äôt smile at all, in Y2V10 he does without realising but he still doesn‚Äôt fully understand why. The difference is, now there‚Äôs someone (Horikita) who unknowingly drew it out of him. And maybe, just maybe, he was hoping she‚Äôd confirm what Yuki once tried to teach him: that some emotions can only exist when you‚Äôre with that specific person


Do y‚Äôall think that he‚Äôll smile again to her again? or someone else? ‚Ä¶.I know that he‚Äôll probably get to the conclusion of this at the end

But at home he labels me as mean and unkind. Even though I do things for him like make coffee or food. Just now I was trying to find a piece of clothing in my closet. I asked him since he had done the laundry yesterday and told him it needs to be in this spot instead so I can find it next time and he just went off that ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do your laundry again‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say anything here ?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúyes you can‚Äôt say mean things anymore‚Äù 

I‚Äôm so tired. I just went back to my work without saying anything. I‚Äôve been showing up to meetings with red nose and eyes with all the crying. ",2,1755889775.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm hoping to keep this one for 5+ years, and if it makes the 10-year mark like my 2015, even better.

I‚Äôm considering the 14‚Äô‚Äô with the M4 Pro chip.
I‚Äôll be doing basic editing of 4K footage, usually 30 minutes to an hour in total.
I‚Äôll also use it for music production in Logic Pro with one or two external plug-ins.

First question: will 24GB RAM be enough going forward? I know it‚Äôll easily handle what I do now, but I‚Äôm not sure about long-term.
Second: I‚Äôm upgrading to 1TB for extra storage when traveling. I know Apple overcharges, but I‚Äôve accepted that.
Third: nano-texture. What are your opinions? I‚Äôve seen some love it and some regret it. I‚Äôd like the option for outdoor/bright light coffee shop use, but I don‚Äôt want to compromise image quality for video editing.

My final dilemma: silver or space black?
I love space black for the looks‚Äîit‚Äôs subtle, great in the dark, and feels stealthy when editing outside home. But I‚Äôve read about ports scratching (expected) and palm rest discoloration over time from last year‚Äôs M3 buyers.
Silver, on the other hand, is classic and gorgeous. It won‚Äôt wear as much, and it stands out nicely in coffee shops.

I change my mind daily on the color, and honestly, that‚Äôs the main reason I haven‚Äôt pulled the trigger yet.",2,1755889762.0,macbookpro,2,1.0,False

Small towns along the river came and went over the next week.¬† The river widened further, eventually forming a large lake.¬† As they approached their destination in the early dawn, Althea watched from the deck, savoring the welcome sight of civilization.¬† The famous bright lights of Nostlyesh shone warmly, illuminating the city‚Äôs skyline.¬† ¬†

Ahead in the reservoir several other plaskas were at anchor, queuing to enter the locks to the river below.¬† Beyond the wide, curved dam, the confluence of the rivers awaited. ¬†The dam‚Äôs once-smooth gray surface was pockmarked with the stains of age, while geese and other birds floated on the still lake.¬† The early silence of the morning was occasionally interrupted by the crowing of a gullken rooster.

The passengers stood on the deck, eager to continue their journey.¬† The captain returned from the shore in the plaska‚Äôs small rowboat.

¬† ‚ÄúAttention, passengers.¬† Due to upstream barge traffic in the locks, we‚Äôll be delayed until this evening.‚Äù

The crowd of tired passengers let out a collective groan.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve arranged for us to dock temporarily at the upriver wharf‚Äù - he gestured towards the nearby shore - ‚Äúand any passengers who wish to, may disembark and head down to the city.‚Äù

Phineas watched the crowd from atop Althea‚Äôs back, the fox curled up in the early morning chill.¬† Another day led to more new sights for the fox as he further grasped the wider world around him.

Althea let out a short cheer.¬† ‚ÄúFinally, a chance to get off this stinking boat!‚Äù

Phineas noticed some sharp looks from the crew members, but Althea was either oblivious or likely didn‚Äôt care.¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll head down the hill, soak in some city life, then get tickets for a fireboat.¬† We can be in Nodessa in a week and finally catch up with Marcus.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what?‚Äù

Althea turned her head to the fox settled on her back.¬† ‚ÄúOff to the next leg of the journey.¬† Marcus will figure out what that damned accursed book has to do with me, I‚Äôll get some answers and finally head back to Velkorra before winter.¬† Life‚Äôs mission complete.‚Äù

Althea froze as soon as the words left her mouth.¬† *Could it really be that simple?¬† If I find where I‚Äôm really from‚Ä¶ what do I do, then?*

More cheers erupted from the crowd as the anchor was raised, and the rowers began slowly moving the boat towards the wharf.

Phineas felt alone and out of place, more so than at any point before.¬† This journey had taken him so far from home into the strange world beyond.¬† *This can‚Äôt get any more different, can it?*

It could.

A loud puffing noise overtook the passengers.¬† Near the dam, twin gleaming stacks arose from behind the lock gates, catching the morning rays of sunlight.¬† Elaborate fluting topped the gleaming translucent chimneys, meticulously crafted from tall glasswood trunks.¬† White smoke puffed out the top, and glowing sparks were visible as they shot up the twin glass spires.¬†

First the yellow flag of Ecror, then gleaming white decks became visible as the boat rose to the level of the lake.¬† To the rear of the huge vessel, a great red wheel, covered in paddles, became visible.¬† The bow of the ship had ornate letters, proclaiming her name: the Velgrade Star.

Phineas was stunned at the sight, his mouth hanging open at the noise and smoke of the giant craft.¬† *Those stories were real?*

Althea grinned at the stunned fox.¬† She simply pointed at the majestic sight dismissively.¬† ‚ÄúSee?¬† A fireboat.¬† Finally, some signs of civilization.‚Äù

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Althea and Phineas stood on the wharf in the afternoon sun as their plaska cast off again.¬† A line of barges and plaskas was forming behind the large, richly filigreed fireboat, preparing for their journey upstream.¬† The fireboat‚Äôs layered decks were alive with carved wood and brass decorations; the railings lined with red banners.¬† As the sun rose, the lake came alive behind the dam.¬† Small boats crisscrossed the water, some by oar, some puffing along with small wheels churning the water behind them.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt your father, like, cross the world?¬† Did he not tell you what Kerik was like?‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù¬† Phineas looked up from the book he had been flipping through.¬† He stuffed it back into his satchel.¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe whole world. You know, Kerik.¬† You told me your father fled with your mother out to the western reaches before you were born.¬† Didn‚Äôt he tell you about his journeys and the world beyond that old forest?‚Äù

Phineas looked down and away, not wanting to meet her eyes.¬† ‚ÄúHe told me some stories‚Ä¶ but I was so young.¬† I was never sure what was real and what was a fairytale.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me started about fairies‚Ä¶¬† I‚Äôve got a story to tell you some time.‚Äù

Phineas looked up sharply, eyes wide in alarm.¬† ‚ÄúWait, fairies are real?‚Äù

Althea‚Äôs incipient tirade was interrupted by a sight for sore eyes - among the storefronts lining the wharf, a coffee shop stood out.¬† Phineas nearly bounced off his perch on her barding as Althea stumbled over the rough, splintery planks of the pier, as she hurried towards her target.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

Phineas sat on a bench, trying to hold the too-large mug of coffee in his paws.¬† He didn‚Äôt want to be seen lapping it up like a dog, instead trying to hold some air of dignity.¬† This focus on appearances led to Phineas dropping his ‚Äò*thing,‚Äô* based on the surprised pedestrians commenting about the fox with the coffee cup.¬† He ignored their chatter, focused on his coffee instead.

Althea stood next to him, savoring the steam from her mug before taking a drink.¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care how much extra it costs.¬† Cocoa in coffee is worth it.‚Äù

Phineas felt energized by his deep black coffee.¬† Back in Duvano, it had revived him from the regrettable night out.¬† Now, though, it made him feel alive.¬† He didn‚Äôt even notice his tail wagging back and forth as he downed the mug.¬†

‚ÄúYou happy down there?‚Äù

He looked up at her, perplexed.¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

She shook her head.¬† ‚ÄúNothing.¬†¬† I was just realizing how I‚Äôve gotten used to some strange sights.‚Äù¬† She signaled the barista for another mug for the fox.

The barista eyed the strange duo before taking the empty.¬† Phineas began working on that mug as well, unaware of the high heat.¬† Althea suppressed more laughs as his tail wagged harder and he seemed to get twitchy from all the coffee.

*I hope it doesn‚Äôt make him sick‚Ä¶*

A large bulletin board in the caf√©‚Äôs outdoor seating area advertised local events for the upcoming black rain festival.¬† Amongst the advertisements, a prominent bounty posting caught Althea‚Äôs eye.¬† Any information leading to the capture of the ‚ÄòWater Tigers‚Äô promised a sizable reward.

‚ÄúHuh.¬† ‚ÄòWater Tigers‚Äô.¬† What a terrible banditry name.‚Äù

Phineas looked up from his coffee, furrowing his brow.¬† ‚ÄúI thought cats don‚Äôt like water.‚Äù

Althea shrugged before taking another drink of coffee.¬† ‚ÄúWho knows.¬† Tigers are mythical anyways, like dragons and lions.‚Äù

¬†As they watched the lake scenery, a fire broke out on one of the large barges near the dam.¬† Steam puffed from a chimney on the barge as river muck was hauled from the water below by still clanking machinery.¬† Flames quickly spread up the framework of the machine as workers scattered frantically, some jumping into the water.¬†

Small boats began to converge on the flaming barge, one shooting out a stream of water.¬† The crew and guards of the plaskas, Felmar included, lowered small boats and rowed away.

¬†Witnessing the scene and the responders struggling to combat it, Phineas felt dreadful.¬† It seemed like there was something he should do as he watched the fire, but he couldn‚Äôt fathom what.¬† There was no way to get to the scene in the middle of the lake, even if he knew how to use one of the boats.¬†

He felt helpless but honestly didn‚Äôt know what he could do anyways, even if he could get there.¬† The crowd of passengers from their boat and others had already dispersed, heading down the road that led to the main city.¬†

A loud explosion from the water perked up both their ears.¬† The dredging barge that had been on fire exploded, sending a fireball high into the air. ¬†Althea shook her head while Phineas watched intently.¬† The second mug of coffee was certainly influencing him now.¬† Sounds were more distinct.¬† The colors were brighter.¬†

He was hyperaware of his surroundings - every leaf blowing, every passerby‚Äôs chatter, every move of the distant firefighting. ¬†It was very odd, with almost a tingle through his body, a feeling he couldn‚Äôt quite name.

A new puffing noise got his attention.¬†¬† He jolted his head to the side, towards the anchored plaskas.¬† They all sat empty while their crews assisted with the disaster near the dam.

A launch boat, roughly a third of the length of a plaska, approached.¬† Small puffs of steam issued from a short vent as the launch chugged along in the water.¬† Streaks of rust stained the unkempt old boat; its deck crowded with unfamiliar men in rough cloth and leather.¬† As the launch drew near each of the anchored boats, two men boarded each plaska, armed with short swords.¬†

‚ÄúAlthea, bandits are robbing the plaskas!‚Äù¬† He pointed, trying to get her attention.

She looked up from her coffee with a sad look.¬† ‚ÄúHmm.¬† That‚Äôs a shame.‚Äù

Phineas‚Äô tail started to swish furiously as he stared down the centaur.¬† ‚ÄúHow can you say that!?¬† Shouldn‚Äôt we help?¬† Isn‚Äôt that some adventurer‚Äôs guild thing, if only at least to try to get paid?‚Äù

She grimaced as she turned to point at the action on the plaska.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs out there in the water, at least half a klick out.¬† We‚Äôre on shore.¬† I don‚Äôt like it, but what can we do?‚Äù¬† She gave a resigned shrug, then finished her coffee.¬†

Althea‚Äôs eyes then widened, taking in the situation.¬† *This can‚Äôt be a coincidence*.¬†¬† ‚ÄúEven the Riverwatch guards are all distracted, out at the fire‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

She looked back to the posting about the ‚ÄòWater Tigers‚Äô.¬† *Still a stupid name, but maybe the local bandits aren‚Äôt so incompetent*.

The bandits quickly plundered each plaska, indiscriminately tossing sacks and parcels over the side when the small steaming boat returned.¬† Phineas saw a scuffle on the deck of the plaska Althea and he had used.¬† A brown-robed man with a shaved head - one of the postal acolytes - tried to take back a large canvas bag from the bandit.¬†

The outlaw pummeled the acolyte with the hilt of his sword, sending his victim crashing to the deck.¬† The fox‚Äôs eyes narrowed, hyper-focused, sensing something strange about the particular bag the acolyte had been fighting for.

Looking intently into her eyes, he continued.¬† ‚ÄúThe thugs out there, they took the mailbags.‚Äù

She nodded as she mulled it over.¬† Phineas‚Äô tail continued to flick back and forth as he considered the strange sense he got from the mailbags.¬† She noticed a slight crackle at the white tip of his tail, sparking like static electricity, as he peered at the stolen mailbag from across the water.

He tapped her side, getting her attention again.¬† ‚ÄúHow exactly did Brittany send that cursed old book to your friend down the river?‚Äù

Althea struggled to remember, looking to the left.¬† ‚ÄúBefore I left, she had wrapped the book in warded binding to neutralize the curse field, then addressed it‚Ä¶‚Äù¬† Her eyes widened as she looked back to Phineas.¬† ‚Äú*She mailed it.*‚Äù

The puffing from the steam launch intensified as it pulled away, laden with loot and bandits, chugging out into the lake.¬† The water churned behind it, whipped by the whirling paddlewheel.

Althea‚Äôs head hung low, slowly shaking her head as her stomach tightened.¬† *They weren‚Äôt targeting us‚Ä¶ but that doesn‚Äôt matter now.*

‚ÄúWell, s\^&\*.‚Äù

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The plaskas had been pulled back to the wharf as the sun set.¬† The captain and the shaken postal acolyte were talking to the Riverwatch lieutenant while Felmar reunited with Althea and Phineas.

‚ÄúZis mail, it was *important*?‚Äù¬† He folded his arms, eyebrow raised.

Phineas nodded, his ears beginning to droop.¬† ‚ÄúVery.¬† It had-‚Äù

Althea cut Phineas off.¬† *I don‚Äôt know how much to really trust Felmar.*¬† ‚ÄúIt had some items important to the Order‚Äôs research project we‚Äôre contracted on.‚Äù¬† She ignored the fox‚Äôs frown.¬† ‚ÄúThe Magesse back in Duvano-Stonebrace shipped it to Nodessa for safekeeping.‚Äù

Felmar stepped back, eyeing Althea and Phineas.¬† ‚ÄúIf zis package for the Order was tr√®s important, why was it in the mail, not with you?¬† Especially with all the bandits downriver?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúGood question.‚Äù¬† Althea sighed, her back hoof tapping.¬† ‚ÄúThe Magesse is‚Ä¶ new.¬† Let‚Äôs put it that way.¬† She‚Äôs not used to how the rougher side of the world works.‚Äù

Felmar raised an eyebrow.¬† ‚ÄúBandits getting bolder, sabotage, assault on a postal cleric, *and* mage business?¬† Zis will get attention.‚Äù

1mxf2aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/branding/comments/1mxf2aq/brands_dont_just_get_famous_they_hit_a_tipping/,"Brands don't just ""get famous"" they hit a Tipping Point. Here‚Äôs the secret ingredient.","Hey everyone,

You've seen it happen. A niche brand that only a few people know is suddenly *everywhere*. One day it's on a small blog, the next it's sold out and your cousin is raving about it.

Think about brands like Stanley cups, Liquid Death, or even Crocs years ago. They didn't just grow steadily. They exploded.

This phenomenon is what author Malcolm Gladwell called the **Tipping Point**: ""that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire.""

In branding, this isn't luck. It‚Äôs a combination of the right message, the right messengers, and the right context. But I believe there's one foundational element that most people miss, and it's the real secret to engineering a tipping point.

**The Problem: You Can't Tip in a Crowded Ocean**

Most brands are stuck trying to be a slightly better or cheaper version of the market leader. They're fighting for a tiny spot in a very crowded mental ""drawer"" (as we discussed in a previous post).

* You sell shoes? You're in the drawer with Nike and Adidas.
* You sell energy drinks? You're fighting Red Bull and Monster.

In these ""red oceans,"" it's almost impossible to reach a tipping point because the audience's attention is already owned by the giants. You can spend millions on ads and still be just noise.

**The Solution: The Tipping Point Happens in a New Category**

The brands that truly tip don't just join a conversation; they start a new one. They don't try to be the *best* in an old category; they become the *only one* in a new category they create themselves.

This new category is the ""secret ingredient."" It's the **Stickiness Factor** that Gladwell talks about. It makes your brand memorable and gives people a reason to talk about you.

Let's look at the examples:

* **Liquid Death** didn't say, ""We're a new bottled water."" They created a new category: *""Canned mountain water for the punk rock/heavy metal crowd that hates corporate marketing.""* Nobody else was in that drawer. It was unique, sticky, and it tipped.
* **Stanley** didn't say, ""We're another insulated tumbler."" They repositioned and created a new category: *""A stylish, collectible hydration accessory for the modern woman, driven by social media trends.""* They turned a utility product into a fashion item. It created a frenzy, and it tipped.

**How to Find Your Tipping Point:**

Instead of asking ""How can my brand go viral?"", start asking these questions:

1. **What crowded drawer is my brand currently in?** Be honest. Who are the giants you're up against?
2. **What new ""drawer"" or category can I create where my brand is the only logical choice?** This isn't about product features; it's about **perception**. Are you the coffee shop for remote workers? The accounting software for freelancers? The shoe for minimalist trail runners?
3. **Who are my ""Mavens and Connectors""?** (Gladwell's ""Law of the Few""). Who are the first 100 people in this new category that will adopt it and spread the word because it perfectly solves their specific problem or fits their identity?

The goal is to stop being a small fish in a big pond and instead, create your own pond where you're the only fish. That's how you build momentum that can eventually tip into the mainstream.

**So, what are your thoughts?**

What other brands have you seen create a new category and then hit their tipping point? I'd love to hear more examples.",0,1755888863.0,branding,0,0.5,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Durham Bulls vs. Lehigh Valley IronPigs: A Game of Grit, Gaffes, and Glorious Walk-Offs**

Let‚Äôs cut to the chase: This matchup is less about who *should* win and more about who *can* win without collapsing like a house of cards in a hurricane. The Durham Bulls and Lehigh Valley IronPigs are set to clash, and the odds reflect a tight contest‚Äîlike two boxers circling each other, both too stubborn to throw in the towel.

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The betting lines tell a story of cautious optimism for both teams. FanDuel lists the Bulls at **1.94** (+94) and the IronPigs at **1.82** (-111), implying a **51.5%** implied probability for Durham and **54.9%** for Lehigh Valley. The spread? A razor-thin **1.5 runs**, with the over/under set at **9.5 total runs**. These numbers scream ‚Äúdefensive battle,‚Äù but the recent history between these teams suggests otherwise.

In their last meeting on August 22, the IronPigs staged a **10-inning walk-off thriller**, scoring two runs in the 10th to edge the Bulls 6-5. That game featured Johan Rojas (two HRs, including a game-tying broken-bat liner that defied physics) and Otto Kemp (a double and a clutch line drive). If you‚Äôre betting on drama, the IronPigs have already paid dividends.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Momentum, and a Ray of Hope

The Bulls‚Äô recent loss to the IronPigs was a microcosm of their season: **Adonis Medina** gave up two runs in the first inning, including a sac fly and a wild pitch that made him look like a rookie fumbling with a coffee machine. Durham‚Äôs offense, meanwhile, relies on the hope that **Carson Williams** (now with the Tampa Bay Rays) isn‚Äôt the future‚Äîthey‚Äôre still waiting for their own prodigy to emerge.

The IronPigs? They‚Äôre riding a wave of **clutch baseball**. Rojas, their hero of the hour, has become the team‚Äôs emotional anchor, while Kemp‚Äôs late-game heroics suggest he‚Äôs mastered the art of ‚Äúpressure-induced batting.‚Äù Manager **Mick Billings** (if he exists

Cleaning isn‚Äôt exactly my favorite task, but the Soft Scrub Gel with Bleach, 28.6 Ounces (Pack of 6), makes it much more bearable. I‚Äôve been testing this gel cleaner for a few weeks now, tackling everything from kitchen counters to bathroom tiles. Its non-abrasive formula is a serious game-changer, cutting through tough stains like tea, coffee, and juice spills without leaving scratches behind. Even on a bad day when I spilled an entire mug of black coffee on the counter, this cleaner wiped it away effortlessly. It‚Äôs safe for most surfaces, which is a relief since I was worried about my laminate countertops at first. The bleach in the formula also gives me the confidence that I‚Äôm not just cleaning but sanitizing my home.

**Ease of Use and Versatile Cleaning Applications**

The gel consistency is a definite highlight here. Unlike liquid cleaners that drip everywhere and powders that seem to create more mess, this gel stays in place, allowing me to focus on stubborn spots like grout or soap scum in my shower. Another great aspect is that it handles a variety of surfaces without scratching. I‚Äôve used it on glass, tile, sinks, and even my shower door, and it worked equally well on all. Having a multipurpose cleaner that works across so many areas of my home simplifies cleaning days.

**Long-Lasting Quantity for Serious Cleaners**

One of the biggest selling points is the sheer amount of product you get. With six bottles in a single pack, totaling 171.6 ounces, I don‚Äôt foresee needing to buy more for quite some time. It‚Äôs perfect for bigger families or anyone who cleans frequently. I‚Äôve even shared a bottle with my sister, and she‚Äôs been raving about how effective it is for cleaning her bathroom. If you clean regularly or like stocking up, this pack is a solid option.

**Advantages**

- Handles tough stains like coffee, tea, and juice effortlessly.
- Safe to use on countertops, glass, sinks, and tiles without damage.
- Non-abrasive formula ensures surfaces remain scratch-free.  

**Downsides**

- The bleach smell can be a bit overpowering, especially in small spaces.
- Gel consistency requires a bit more effort to rinse off than sprays.

**Industry Competitors**

Compared to other all-purpose cleaners I‚Äôve tried, like Method‚Äôs all-purpose cleaning sprays and Bar Keepers Friend, the Soft Scrub Gel stands out for its versatility and stain-fighting power. Method is great for a natural cleaning solution, but it doesn't perform as well on heavy-duty stains. Bar Keepers Friend excels with tougher residue on pots and stainless steel but falls short when cleaning grout or glass. Both competitors also lack the built-in sanitizer feature that bleach provides. While the bleach in Soft Scrub might deter odor-sensitive users, it sets this gel apart in terms of cleaning depth and thorough disinfection.

**Affordable Quality**

Considering the number of bottles you receive in one pack and the versatility of applications, the product delivers excellent value for its price. Many cleaners run out quickly or are too specialized, but this gel cleaner lasts and adapts to different needs. You‚Äôre not just buying a cleaner for one specific area of the house; you‚Äôre getting an all-rounder that‚Äôs budget-friendly in the long run.

1mxey91,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1mxey91/game_over_theres_wasnt_one_in_the_first_place/,Game over ? There's wasn't one in the first place?,"No one is more shallow than a man or woman swiping faces on dating apps. You‚Äôre literally judging a person only by their looks. People often fall into this bias where if someone looks good, they assume that person must also be a good human being. Later, they realise they fell for the wrong one. Looks matter 100% in today‚Äôs world because of social media. Nobody really wants genuine connections anymore. Everyone‚Äôs just trying to look attractive and losing themselves in the process.

Average-looking but great people get ignored because dating them might feel like a hit to someone‚Äôs social status. The funniest part is how we even rate people just by looks. That baddie is a 10/10, that guy‚Äôs a 10/10‚Ä¶ but how the hell can you call someone 10/10 just by their face? What if they‚Äôve got terrible habits? What if they‚Äôre actually a shitty human being?

Dating and relationships were supposed to be beautiful, something people remembered as one of the best phases of their lives. Now it feels like we have turned dating into...what we call it. Yes, a ""game"". We even have stats for it: body counts. Having zero body count makes you a noob. And if you wanna level up your game, the non-negotiables are simple: good looks, height if you‚Äôre lucky, money (optional), and of course a solid face card just to even enter. Being a good human with strong moral values barely matters anymore, because it doesn‚Äôt raise your stats and it won‚Äôt get your game up.From a man‚Äôs perspective (call me incel, idgaf) but dating is way worse for men like me who don‚Äôt have those so-called non-negotiables.

Here‚Äôs my real-life experience: I‚Äôm bulky, slightly muscular but ugly, with an asymmetrical face that looks different from every angle. For years I focused only on studies, career, and introvert hobbies like writing and art. But when I turned 20, this emotional void hit me. It made my writing better, sure, but it made me lonelier than ever. I cried about it with my two friends. Slowly though, I started becoming more extroverted and naturally funnier. People around me, colleagues, neighbours, even family, told me I should try stand-up comedy. And I thought, if girls really like funny guys, maybe I should finally shoot my shot.

But nah, reality slapped me hard. I tried dating apps, swiping endlessly like the rest of the shallow crowd. Got two matches, probably only because of my funny prompts. First girl ghosted me after a week of talking, didn‚Äôt even want to meet for coffee. I said fine, move on. Second girl matched, talked a bit, then blocked me. But before leaving, she sent this: You‚Äôre a great guy, very talented, one of the most creative people I‚Äôve ever met‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not attracted to you. I said it‚Äôs cool, we can be friends, and she agreed. A few days later I saw her story, bouquet in hand, smiling with some six foot good-looking dude.

That day I realised this so-called game is brutal. And for guys like me, the game‚Äôs already over. I find peace playing games on my friend‚Äôs PS4, they‚Äôre still easier than this one you all are playing. I honestly hope you guys win this game and pass all its missions. But me, I‚Äôm out. I‚Äôm straight up scared of these creatures called women in this game.

And before you try to call me out, let me clear this up. I love and Respect women a lot and always will. This is just a rant about the era of dating we live in. Thankfully, I‚Äôve got some good female friends and a bunch of sisters. But when it comes to dating, I‚Äôll always be afraid and low key traumatised by my experiences.

Well, I guess I'm  a strong person and I‚Äôve made peace with the fact that for basic human needs I will need to overcome all this trauma. I‚Äôm also trying to achieve all the mentioned non-negotiables slowly, and hopefully one day I will pass this game too, just like many of you in this sub, and will showcase my reward here just like everyone does. I hope I make it to the leaderboard of this game one day.

 I hope you won‚Äôt mind that I am asking for your assistance to help our friends at the Coalition to End Homelessness again.  They have been working hard at getting 8 units ready to go for unhoused individuals, but they still have four units that they are needing to adopt out.   If you, your business or group is interested in adopting a unit, details and contact information are in the photos above. 

 CCEH is anticipating being able to move individuals into these units the middle of September, and I am hopeful that we can give them a hand in acquiring some basic, but much needed components.  If you‚Äôre like me, perhaps you are able to recall the expenses that came with setting up your brand new space.  If you were lucky like me, you might have even been given a helping hand in this process. 

In an effort to pay it forward and to help these individuals on their new journey, I am hoping that you will help me collect some very pertinent items:

*  Purple (pay as you throw) Trash Bags
* Cleaning Supplies ‚Äì Glass Cleaner, Toilet Cleaners, Multi-Surface Cleaners, etc
* Hand Soap
* Dish Soap
* Sponges
* Paper Towels
* Toilet Paper
* Cooking Utensils
* Oven Mitts
* Toilet Plunger

**""Nice to have"" items also include:**

* New Bath Garbage Can
* New Bath Towel Set
* New Shower Curtains
* New Shower Liners
* New Laundry Basket
* New Kitchen Towels
* New Food Storage Containers
* New Kitchen Garbage Can
* New twin Sheet Set
* New pillow

There are other items that will be needed ‚Äì coffee makers, TVs, pots and pans, cookie sheets and furniture that will be really challenging to collect the day of, at the protest, but if this is something that you‚Äôd like to donate, please let me know, and I‚Äôll do my absolute best to coordinate with you to make this happen.  If there is enough interest and we are able to check off all the items on the standard furnishing list, I will work with them to adopt a unit. 

 Please note that any monetary donations that are collected the day of will be used to purchase items off the above list, and anything extra will be provided back to the Resource Center.  As always, I will do a transparency post after the event so that you can see what all we collected.   I will also have a QR code if you would prefer to support them directly financially.

 I‚Äôll be hanging out in the purple tent on Labor Day at the NH State House, and I hope that you will come by, say hi and show me your signs!  

 As always, I am grateful to you all for helping me to help our community.

1mxeuxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tipstor/comments/1mxeuxf/how_zeroproof_drinks_are_redefining_flavor/,How Zero-Proof Drinks Are Redefining Flavor,"The new frontier in hospitality tastes like citrus oils over crushed ice, juniper without the burn, and a bartender who can pull a memory out of a garden instead of a bottle. Non-alcoholic craft beverages have slipped the velvet rope and taken the main stage, riding the same wave that‚Äôs pushing travelers back onto roads and runways.

The ground is shifting under the bar top. IWSR forecasts the U.S. no-alcohol category to expand at an 18% volume CAGR from 2024 to 2028, on track to approach 5 billion US dollars by 2028, with no-alcohol beer and fast-rising RTDs doing the heavy lifting. NIQ‚Äôs year-end review reports non-alcoholic beverage alcohol sales nearing 1 billion US dollars in off-premise channels and a 31% growth clip, even as traditional wine staggers. The Brewers Association adds another plot twist with 2024 craft beer volumes down and share slipping, a sign that the old script doesn‚Äôt automatically sell in a world where flavor is still king but ethanol is optional. Gallup catches the cultural wind. Only 54% of U.S. adults now report drinking, a near 90-year low, and a majority say even moderate drinking is bad for health. The demand signal is loud and disciplined. Clean-label mixers, botanical aperitifs, zero-proof ‚Äúspirits,‚Äù kombuchas that don‚Äôt taste like a science project, and coffee programs that drink like cocktail lists.

This is where an AI earns its keep by treating beverage programs like high-velocity product lines and traveler journeys like living datasets. Lifecycle management starts with intent mapping at the trip-planning stage and follows the guest from search to check-in to late-night lobby craving. Models watch for the Thursday spike in ‚Äúdry bar near me‚Äù and ‚Äúzero-proof tasting‚Äù queries, score loyalty profiles for curiosity about limited runs, and push right-sized offers that feel like a confidant, not a coupon. When TSA throughput swells or AAA projects highway surges, inventory is reweighted toward batchable zero-proof signatures to reduce dwell time at the bar. When rain washes out patio hours, the engine pivots to guided tastings with a bartender-educator and a kitchen pairing. Price moves get subtle and fast. Push a 4% lift on the premium NA flight when local events spike, cover it with a chef‚Äôs amuse valued at 8 US dollars, and protect contribution margin without bruising trust.

Trend identification becomes a contact sport, not a quarterly memo. AI scrapes menus, distributor briefs, and social chatter to rank upstart flavors. Yuzu and shiso moving from garnish to headliner, verjus returning as a low-sugar acid backbone, smoked teas replacing barrel notes, and espresso-martini energy reimagined with house cold brew and cacao bitters. The system flags which combinations convert in drive-markets versus fly-ins, which garnishes produce a photo every third order, and which zero-proof classic actually cannibalizes paid dessert. The playbook rewards nimble producers too. Partnerships with micro-kombucha brewers two counties over, pop-ups from a zero-proof amaro maker, a collab can release that rides a local festival. When models suggest a weekend spike, prep goes to batched high-margin signatures. When Monday to Wednesday softens, the calendar leans into classes and tasting flights that turn locals into ambassadors.

Tourism‚Äôs momentum sets the table. Non-alcoholic craft beverages keep guests at it longer and bring them back cleaner. UN Tourism shows the tide is running, TSA and AAA confirm the movement on the ground, and WTTC draws the economic perimeter around the opportunity. IWSR and NIQ explain why the glass is changing shape. The competitive advantage belongs to operators who treat zero-proof as cuisine, not compromise, and wire the whole journey with intelligence. That story tastes like citrus and cardamom on a rooftop at golden hour, the soft clink of a well-made drink that clears the head, and a receipt that reads like a souvenir. Proof that flavor and restraint can move revenue with the same force as any bottle.

For a son, those one-on-one moments with your dad can be rare, especially when life pulls you in so many directions. But that evening, I found myself opening up about the tough grind of building my startup.

He asked me, ""How's it going? You mentioned a few weeks ago you started something new."" And I told him honestly: it's tough. There's a lot of mess, a lot of pending work, and both my co-founder and I are working hard, but clarity is missing. 

We just don‚Äôt know which step to take first to make everything fall into place.

And then my father said something that hit me deeply. He said, ""If you believe in your dream, you'll cross this ocean too."" In that moment, I didn't just see my father; I saw a long-lost mentor and friend reminding me that every dream has a price.

He told me, ""If you really want something, you'll have to sacrifice for it. You might lose sleep. You'll have to put aside those distractions, even fun times with friends, because your startup needs your full dedication.""

He reminded me that nothing happens overnight. One day, after years of effort, maybe two, three, or five years, that ""overnight success"" will come, and your graph will suddenly shoot up. But only if you believe and keep going, no matter who doubts you.

So to everyone reading this:, we all hit those moments in our startup journey where it feels too dark to continue. 

But remember, if today is dark, tomorrow will bring light. If no one sees your hard work today, they will see it tomorrow.

My best friend and I have known each other since 2013. From 2013‚Äì2016, our friendship was really stable and strong. Then life took us in different directions: I got married, had a baby, and dealt with postpartum depression in a toxic marriage. Around the same time, she was struggling with drug use and eventually went into rehab.

After she recovered, I tried reaching out and wanted her to be involved in my kids‚Äô lives (we always considered each other like sisters). But she never really reciprocated. Calls went unanswered, and eventually I matched her energy and we grew distant. Over the years I watched her do well‚Äîshe finished school, partied, traveled‚Äîand I was genuinely happy for her. Still, I felt a sadness that our friendship wasn‚Äôt what it used to be.

After the pandemic, she started reaching out here and there, suggesting girls‚Äô nights. But because of my kids and controlling ex-husband at the time, I couldn‚Äôt go out. Instead, I‚Äôd invite her for coffee or lunch. She never really took me up on it.

Fast forward: I divorced, moved back into town, and she was nearby too. But still, she only invited me to do single-girl things like tubing or cocktail parties‚Äînot really family-oriented stuff. She would even joke ‚Äúf*** them kids, let‚Äôs go!‚Äù but my kids are my priority. She never really tried to be involved in their lives, and I‚Äôve had to accept that.

This year, I was in a bad accident as a pedestrian and was hospitalized. She visited twice, which I appreciated, but then she got busy‚Äîshe was planning her wedding and pregnancy. I understood.

Now, she‚Äôs had her baby, and suddenly she‚Äôs reaching out a lot more. She wants to plan playdates and talk about motherhood. And while part of me wants to welcome this, another part of me keeps thinking: I‚Äôve been a mom for 10 years‚Äîwhere were you all this time?

I know she has no obligation to be part of my life or my kids‚Äô lives, but I can‚Äôt help but feel conflicted.

Am I wrong for feeling this way? Should I try to let go of the past and just accept that maybe now is her way of trying? Or is it fair to feel like she only values me now that she can relate to my situation?",1,1755888209.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

Last Sunday evening, I was just sitting down with my Dad over a cup of coffee.

For a son, those one-on-one moments with your dad can be rare, especially when life pulls you in so many directions. But that evening, I found myself opening up about the tough grind of building my startup.

He asked me, ""How's it going? You mentioned a few weeks ago you started something new."" And I told him honestly: it's tough. There's a lot of mess, a lot of pending work, and both my co-founder and I are working hard, but clarity is missing.

We just don‚Äôt know which step to take first to make everything fall into place.

And then my Dad said something that hit me deeply. He said, ""If you believe in your dream, you'll cross this ocean too."" In that moment, I didn't just see my Dad; I saw a long-lost mentor and friend reminding me that every dream has a price.

He told me, ""If you really want something, you'll have to sacrifice for it. You might lose sleep. You'll have to put aside those distractions, even fun times with friends, because your startup needs your full dedication.""

He reminded me that nothing happens overnight. One day, after years of effort, maybe two, three, or five years, that ""overnight success"" will come, and your graph will suddenly shoot up. But only if you believe and keep going, no matter who doubts you.

So to everyone reading this:, we all hit those moments in our startup journey where it feels too dark to continue.

But remember, if today is dark, tomorrow will bring light. If no one sees your hard work today, they will see it tomorrow.

We are here to win, and we will win. Let‚Äôs¬†keep¬†pushing.",2,1755888112.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

## What Is Eden?

Eden is a plant-based supplement designed as a morning drink mix. It's packed with superfoods, adaptogens, and probiotics to support your body's natural functions. Think of it as an easy way to get more greens into your day without chomping on salads all the time.

This supplement targets folks who want to improve their overall health without complicated changes. It's great for busy parents, office workers, or anyone over 40 looking to maintain energy and vitality. Eden isn't a magic pill‚Äîit's more like a daily helper that fits into your coffee or smoothie routine. Many users mix it with water or juice for a quick start to the day.

## Key Benefits of Eden

Eden offers several perks that users rave about. Based on its natural ingredients, it may help in these areas:

* **Boosted Energy Levels:** The blend of matcha and adaptogens like ashwagandha can provide steady energy without the crash from caffeine alone.
* **Better Digestion:** Probiotics and fiber-rich greens like spirulina and chlorella support gut health, which is key for feeling good overall.
* **Stronger Immunity:** Antioxidants from beets and mushrooms may help your body fight off everyday stressors.
* **Improved Mental Clarity:** Adaptogens are known to help manage stress, potentially leading to sharper focus and a calmer mind.
* **Overall Wellness Support:** With vitamins and minerals, it could aid in longevity and daily vitality, as some reviews suggest.

In real life, I've heard from friends who use similar greens powders‚Äîthey say it helps them skip the afternoon slump. Of course, results vary, but many report feeling more balanced after a few weeks.

## How Eden Works

Eden works by delivering a concentrated dose of nutrients your body might miss from diet alone. When you mix the powder into a drink, the superfoods get absorbed quickly, supporting your gut, adrenals, and immune system.

Adaptogens in Eden, like Korean ginseng, help your body adapt to stress by balancing hormones. Meanwhile, greens provide fiber for digestion, and mushrooms add immune-boosting compounds. It's all about synergy‚Äîthe ingredients team up to promote balance without overwhelming your system.

No fancy jargon here: It's like giving your body a nutrient hug to handle daily life better. Always chat with your doctor before starting, especially if you have health conditions.

## What's Inside Eden: Key Ingredients and Features

Eden stands out with its clean, natural formula. Here's a breakdown of some main ingredients:

* **Spirulina and Chlorella:** Algae superfoods rich in protein and antioxidants for detox and energy.
* **Wheatgrass and Barley Grass:** Packed with vitamins and chlorophyll to support vitality.
* **Moringa:** A nutrient powerhouse with vitamins A, C, and calcium for overall health.
* **Beet Root Powder and Lemon Powder:** Add natural sweetness and antioxidants for heart and immune support.
* **Ashwagandha and Korean Ginseng:** Adaptogens that may reduce stress and boost stamina.
* **Shiitake Mushroom and Matcha:** For immune function and a gentle caffeine lift.
* **Probiotics:** To promote healthy gut bacteria.

Eden is free from artificial sweeteners, flavors, and preservatives. It's made in facilities following good manufacturing practices, though it's not FDA-approved‚Äîas with all supplements. The company emphasizes natural sourcing, and it's suitable for vegans.

## Pros and Cons of Eden

To keep it real, let's look at both sides:

* May support energy, digestion, and stress management based on user feedback.

I'm(19FTM) not calling him(20M) my boyfriend because we aren't really boyfriends, it's some weird situationship shit. let's use T as a name placeholder. we dated in highschool, during that time he was the absolute sweetest man id ever met. i mean goddamn he was amazing. and then after we graduated he broke up with me because he was going to boot camp. his reasoning was ""i cant guarantee that I'll be able to attend to you like you need and that I won't neglect you while I'm in there so it's better this way"" but i thought there's plenty of couples who make the military work, right?? but he wasn't having it and left anyway.

whoopsie daisy two or three-ish weeks later T's back because he got ejected from boot camp for reasons that he still has never shared with me, but all i know is that he called me from the ward and said ""hey sorry i took a grippy sock vacation im alive though"". i was really worried about him but he insisted that i not press the issue. i didn't want to push him away so i didn't.

so then we go that whole summer afterwards without rly talking much, we would see each other when the friendgroup meets up but not outside of that. fall starts and i go into college classes, he gets a job, and in like september we talk again and have a heart to heart. i finally get him to open up a bit and while we're sitting on the old train tracks, he says he wants to try again. he says he doesn't know how far, but that he does love me and wants to stay by me. thing is, he's super on-and-off that whole time, like when we're face to face hes absolutely lovely but his texts are dry as shit and it's hard to organize meetings with him. it got to a point where he would go a week at a time just not responding to me and i didnt know what the deal was. he just wouldn't fucking tell me anything, he wouldn't even give me a simple ""hey sorry gonna be kinda dead the next few days but dont worry its okay"" like thats literally the minimum that i would have needed. i had to pry shit out of him with a crowbar. i couldn't take it anymore and i asked him point blank ""T what are we. why won't you talk to me. i need an answer i can't stand the uncertainty anymore"" and he said he didn't know and we argued a bit and it ended up with us backing off and ""splitting up"" again even though we were never back together a second time i guess.

we didn't talk much at all after that but we still sent each other random ass tiktoks once in a blue moon. me more than him, and i'd send him actual texts (check in texts or random shit) once every two weeks or so just to make sure his ass is alive and let him know I haven't forgotten about him because he's told me in the past that his friendships don't last because some of the people just stop talking to him eventually and don't notice when he disappears. that right there is a big reason why i haven't just up and ditched him because of his radio silence spells because i know he's probably got his own shit going on and i don't want to abandon him if he's just trying to cope. I NOTICE when he disappears and it stresses me out when he won't respond but I don't want to just give up on him

cut another half year forward, first year of college is over and its the beginning of last june. its like 10 pm and im in the forest near the park with two of my friends (A and Z) fighting with light up swords we got from Walmart (yeah i know that sounds stupid and childish but it was fun). i sat down for a second because my big ass was out of breath and i just sent T a picture of my sword and the soda i had with the caption 'adventure time'. it was pitch black out there without flashlights so the flash of my phone camera showed my sword, my soda bottle, my shoes, the ground and then literal void beyond that but I didn't think much of it because i didn't actually expect him to respond. 

my phone dies like 3 minutes after and i go back to fucking around with swords and then me, A and Z go home at 11:30. once my phone is charged i see like SEVEN messages from T, all in a row which is WAY out of field for him. the most i was expecting was like a ""huh"" or a ""nice"" or just nothing at all. but his messages looked more like:
- why are you in the forest, are you okay?
- what soda is that
- you there?
- please be careful
- i know you're probably fine but let me know when you get home safe

and i saw those and said ""yeah sorry; im fine phone died"" and we chatted a bit while i made sure A and Z's sandwiches didn't burn (we make grilled cheeses at midnight a lot when we hang out). me and A and Z got home at 11:30 but I didn't check my messages until 12:30. yeah so apparently like 5 minutes after we left the forest, he WENT TO THE FOREST to check on me and see if i was okay/still there since i stopped responding after my phone died because he was worried. wrong park forest though lmao he went to a different one but the thought was still there.

and after a semester and a half of near-silence obviously that was a surprise and a half bc what the fuck do you mean you *sought me out*??? but the fact that he cared at least made me feel kinda better. he started being a lot more vocal and talking a lot more and he actually reached out and started the conversation first bit more which was nice. we met up for coffee, which was the first one on one meeting we'd had in like a year. a day later we met up at the park again (same forest i was at woth A and Z) and took a walk through the trails to talk. it was really joking and chill and it was nice and then he kissed me. and i let him because i missed him and i don't know what i was thinking (spoiler: i wasn't). he almost called me ""love"" like he used to but then he apologized because he said that kinda thing needs to be earned first and he hasn't earned the right to call me that again.

and for the last three months since then, we've been talking again and meeting up and acting like partners again, intimacy and all, just without actually calling it boyfriends. he doesn't call me pet names or say 'i love you' or 'i miss you' because in his words ""it's a bit early for that"". He said he *does* want this, he just needs his own time. and, like i mentioned before, pressing him for a label was partially what fucked us up last time and at this point I've stopped caring about the label part of it. i dont care about whether or not he'll call us boyfriends, i just wanted him to still want to be around me. and I thought that him coming to me this time meant that he was actually going to work on the radio silence and stop disappearing on me for a week at a time. I thought I wouldn't have to break out the crowbar again just to pry two and a half word texts out of him. its been a week and all I've gotten is an 'im alive'. that's it.

its a situationship. thats the long and short of it, it would be stupid to call it anything else. do i even have the right to feel hurt here??? it hurts when he goes silent on me but then i feel like I'm being overbearing and clingy. he's there for me when we're face to face, he listens to me when i need to spill my guts, but then he refuses to spill his own when he knows that i would gladly reciprocate it all. i don't know what to think. i love him a lot but I don't know if I'm just being way too much. sometimes i wonder if he would even say something or come back eventually if i stopped texting him myself but I don't know if that's even a reasonable thing to think.

and no he's not seeing someone else i know that for a fact, and it's also not because I'm trans, I've already ruled that out.",2,1755888086.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

My best friend and I have known each other since 2013. From 2013‚Äì2016, our friendship was really stable and strong. Then life took us in different directions: I got married, had a baby, and dealt with postpartum depression in a toxic marriage. Around the same time, she was struggling with drug use and eventually went into rehab.

After she recovered, I tried reaching out and wanted her to be involved in my kids‚Äô lives (we always considered each other like sisters). But she never really reciprocated. Calls went unanswered, and eventually I matched her energy and we grew distant. Over the years I watched her do well through her social media‚Äîshe finished school, partied, traveled‚Äîand I was genuinely happy for her. Still, I felt a sadness that our friendship wasn‚Äôt what it used to be.

After the pandemic, she started reaching out here and there, suggesting girls‚Äô nights. But because of my kids and controlling ex-husband at the time, I couldn‚Äôt go out. Instead, I‚Äôd invite her for coffee or lunch. She never really took me up on it.

Fast forward: I divorced, moved back into town, and she was nearby too. But still, she only invited me to do single-girl things like tubing or cocktail parties‚Äînot really family-oriented stuff. She would even joke ‚Äúf*** them kids, let‚Äôs go!‚Äù but my kids are my priority. She never really tried to be involved in their lives, and I‚Äôve had to accept that.

This year, I was in a bad accident as a pedestrian and was hospitalized. She visited twice, which I appreciated, but then she got busy‚Äîshe was planning her wedding and pregnancy. I understood.

Now, she‚Äôs had her baby, and suddenly she‚Äôs reaching out a lot more. She wants to plan playdates and talk about motherhood. And while part of me wants to welcome this, another part of me keeps thinking: I‚Äôve been a mom for 10 years‚Äîwhere were you all this time?

I know she has no obligation to be part of my life or my kids‚Äô lives, but I can‚Äôt help but feel conflicted.

Am I wrong for feeling this way? Should I try to let go of the past and just accept that maybe now is her way of trying? Or is it fair to feel like she only values me now that she can relate to my situation?",1,1755888080.0,Mommit,3,0.99,False

1mxen92,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mxen92/why_choose_the_jura_e4_espresso_machine_review/,Why Choose the Jura E4 Espresso Machine Review for Perfect Coffee?,"The Jura 15560 Espresso Machine, branded as the Jura E4 Piano White Automatic Coffee Machine, caught my attention for its sleek design and promise of fully automated coffee brewing. As someone who can‚Äôt imagine starting the day without my caffeine fix, this machine seemed like a natural fit in my daily routine. Over a few weeks of testing, I‚Äôve found this coffee maker to have standout strengths and a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**

One aspect that immediately stood out was the elegant piano white exterior with its glossy finish. The minimalist design feels premium and effortlessly blends into both contemporary and traditional kitchen spaces. Its dimensions (17.6""D x 11""W x 13.8""H) make it a sizable appliance, but not overwhelmingly so‚Äîit plants itself firmly on the counter without dominating the room. The machine's weight, at 22 pounds, lends a robust, high-quality feel unlikely to budge under accidental nudges. Buttons on the interface are well-placed and tactile, making navigation highly intuitive.

**Highlights**

- The professional aroma grinder ensures consistently ground coffee beans for a rich brew.  
- Fully integrated reusable filter system, cutting back on waste compared to single-use capsules.  
- Glossy finish adds modern appeal without being a fingerprint magnet.  

[Check Jura 15560 Espresso Machine price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0b69lj3bd/)

**Performance and Brewing Options**

Black coffee enthusiasts will appreciate the Jura E4‚Äôs focus. Whether you‚Äôre in the mood for bold Ristretto shots or a smooth Americano, this machine lives up to expectations. Its ability to extract full-bodied flavors using the exclusive Pulse Extraction Process (PEP) is far superior to most other options I‚Äôve tried in the mid-luxury price range. After fiddling with the three intensity levels, I found that even some of my pickiest friends‚Äîwho swear by their local barista‚Äîwere impressed with the brew quality.

The water tank boasts a 64 oz capacity, perfect for multiple servings without frequent refills, while the 10 oz bean container lets you go a few days without topping up, depending on use. I really enjoyed that fresh beans, rather than premade capsules, could be used; it felt more eco-friendly and authentic.

**Usability and Settings**

What‚Äôs great is how simple it is to select your desired brew. The symbol-display navigation system is straightforward, almost to a fault. Press a button, and the machine does the rest. However, customizing my brew beyond choosing intensity levels wasn‚Äôt possible‚Äîthere‚Äôs no temperature adjustment or milk frother if latte or cappuccino is your thing. The fully automated cleaning cycle is a big relief‚Äîno need to babysit this machine. Still, you have to rinse and refill its components frequently if making several cups each day.

**Positives**

- Easy one-touch operation simplifies the brewing process significantly.  
- Large tank and bean container reduce constant maintenance.  

**Negatives**

- Lack of milk-based drink options might alienate fans of lattes or cappuccinos.  
- Limited customization options for temperature or brew strength beyond intensity levels.  

**Energy Efficiency and Maintenance**

Another standout feature is that this coffee maker is environmentally geared. It grinds coffee beans fresh without the waste associated with single-use pods. Over time, this creates noticeably less landfill waste. Its fully automatic cleaning modes and the use of a reusable filter means maintenance feels guilt-free and less daunting overall. That said, the internal components are sometimes tough to reach if you need manual cleaning, particularly areas behind the grinding mechanism.

**Alternative Offerings**

The Jura 15560 found itself competing with products like the De'Longhi Magnifica S and Breville Bambino Plus. While these alternatives might excel in versatility, especially with milk-based beverages, they fall short of matching the Jura E4‚Äôs brewing quality for black coffee lovers. By comparison, the Jura machine feels better suited for purists who want a hassle-free, streamlined device.

For instance, the De‚ÄôLonghi Magnifica offers a built-in milk frother and slightly more compact dimensions. However, it lacks the patented Pulse Extraction Process, which truly separates Jura's flavors from the competition. Meanwhile, Breville focuses on semi-automatic processes that provide users more control but demand more effort.

**Cost Efficiency**

When considering its price tag, the Jura E4 leans toward the premium category. Yet, its durability, aroma grinder‚Äôs longevity, and solid brewing performance make it a worthy contender. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option, but coffee connoisseurs who lean heavily on black coffee preparation will notice its value with every cup. Budget shoppers might struggle to see why they should fork over the extra cash but think of it as an investment.

I‚Äôm a 24-year-old woman (USA, Eastern Time) looking for a romance-focused, slice-of-life roleplay with a male or female character. I want something sweet, emotional, and character-driven‚Äîwith a slow burn that leads to real love. üíï

I had an idea I‚Äôd love to explore:


Your character is going through a rough time ‚Äî they‚Äôre without a home, drifting, and doing their best to survive each day. My character notices them often (maybe outside a coffee shop, a park, or near her job). At first, it‚Äôs just small acts of kindness: a coffee, a conversation, a smile. Slowly, the walls begin to lower, trust builds, and something deeper begins to grow between them.

But it won‚Äôt be easy. Your character might feel ashamed, afraid of holding mine back, or unworthy of love. My character will have to prove that her care isn‚Äôt about pity ‚Äî it‚Äôs about them. Together, they‚Äôll navigate intimacy, struggles, healing, and what it means to truly choose each other despite the odds.

üëâ The Vibe:

	‚Ä¢	Tender, heartfelt, emotional.

	‚Ä¢	Small moments of intimacy (sharing food, caring for each other when sick, star-gazing).

	‚Ä¢	Conflict rooted in fear and vulnerability, not drama for the sake of it.

	‚Ä¢	A hopeful ending ‚Äî building a new future together.

‚∏ª

About Me:

	‚Ä¢	I write in first person

	‚Ä¢	No strict length rules ‚Äî just give me something to work with

	‚Ä¢	I work full-time, so my replies may be slower during the day, but I always respond!

Here is an excerpt: Two days later, they came for him.

Julius was alone in the barn, checking the stalls and gathering tools in preparation for Israel Hochstadter‚Äôs visit later that week. The shochet would be coming to inspect one of the cows for slaughter. Max and Zev had gone out to the far pasture to check on the herd and select which animal would be taken.

He had just stretched to hang a pitchfork on its hook when he heard it - tires crunching slowly over gravel. He stepped into the doorway, squinting toward the road. A black car rolled up to the barn, its polished grille catching the morning light like a blade.

Two men stepped out.

Julius recognized the trench coats, the posture, the calculated calm of men who moved with the confidence of¬†unchecked power. His stomach turned cold. He didn‚Äôt need to see the insignia to know who they were.

*Gestapo*, he thought.

His heart pounded, but he kept his face blank as they approached.

One of them walked ahead of the other, pulling a folded document from his coat.¬†

‚ÄúJulius Neuburger,‚Äù he said coolly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll come with us.‚Äù

Julius‚Äôs voice remained steady, though his chest had tightened. ‚ÄúWhy? What have I done?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnti-state activity,‚Äù the man replied.

Julius stiffened. ‚ÄúTalk to me here. I have nothing to hide.‚Äù

The officer‚Äôs voice sharpened slightly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll come with us.‚Äù

So it had come to this.

He looked toward the pasture, but from where he stood, the fields were empty; Max and Zev had disappeared behind the rise. No one was in sight. No one would be coming.

He nodded once. ‚ÄúGive me a moment,‚Äù he said quietly, stepping back inside to grab his shirt. As he pulled it on over his undershirt, his eyes landed again on the pitchfork. For a half-second, the thought crossed his mind‚Äîhe could fight. But he quickly pushed it away. They carried guns. It wouldn‚Äôt be much of a fight.

As he stepped outside,¬†one officer moved behind him and cuffed his hands behind his back, yanking the restraints with deliberate force. The other opened the back door of the car, motioning for him to get in. The first man climbed in beside him, close enough to prevent any thoughts of escape.

As the car pulled away, Julius stared out the window, watching the barn recede as the gravel road curved away from the farm. Near the fence line, he spotted a small tin pail, one Werner had used just days earlier to collect eggs with him. It lay on its side in the dirt, forgotten. His thoughts raced; of Werner, of Max, of what might happen next. What would they be told?

The metal cuffs bit into his wrists, pressing bone against iron. He shifted slightly, trying to relieve the pressure, but there was no comfortable position. The pain sharpened his focus, anchoring him in the moment.¬†¬†Best to stay quiet until he understood what they‚Äôd heard‚Äîand how much trouble he was in.

He had known they might come. But he‚Äôd imagined shouting, a struggle, chaos.¬†

Instead, they came with quiet voices and a black car on a clear morning.

They didn‚Äôt take him far.

The car rolled into the village square and stopped outside the sandstone fa√ßade of the town hall. Julius had walked past this building hundreds of times‚Äîpaid taxes here, registered livestock, signed war bonds with his father during the war. But now, led around the side and down a short flight of stairs to a heavy iron door, it felt like something else entirely.

The officer in front of him knocked once. The door creaked open, revealing a dim hallway lined with bare bulbs. They led him into a basement room that reeked of damp stone and bleach. A black telephone hung crookedly on the wall.¬†¬†At the center stood a single table, scuffed and stained, bolted to the floor. One chair. One dangling bulb overhead.

They unshackled his wrists and ordered him to sit, only to recuff him seconds later, this time to a short iron bar bolted into the center of the table. The metal bar was cold against his skin.

He could feel the second man watching, pacing slowly behind him.¬†¬†¬†Calm, almost amused, he circled to face him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quieter than I expected. Word is, you‚Äôre quite the talker.‚Äù¬†¬†

Julius said nothing.

The man dropped a thin folder on the table. ‚ÄúMarketplace. Last year. Ring a bell? Shouting about desecrated graves. Causing a scene. And now,‚Äù he tapped the folder, ‚Äúyou threaten the state again. What was it you said? That those responsible would be punished?‚Äù

Julius didn‚Äôt flinch. He stared at the folder but didn‚Äôt speak.

The two officers stood over him. The taller one leaned in, a cruel smile curling at the corner of his mouth.¬†¬†""Why do you persist in your defiance? Do you believe your words will change anything?""¬†

Julius met his gaze, voice low but unwavering, despite the tight knot of danger twisting in his stomach. ‚ÄúYour actions are a betrayal. I said what I meant.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, we know,‚Äù the man smirked. ‚ÄúBernmann and Fuhrmann were quite clear.‚Äù

‚ÄúCowards,‚Äù Julius muttered.

The scarred officer stepped forward - stockier, with a jagged ridge splitting one brow. He grabbed Julius by the collar and yanked him forward. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to speak about Germans that way, Jew. You have your place - mind it.‚Äù

Julius could feel sweat gathering under his arms, dripping down his chest. But his voice held. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be silent while my ancestors are bulldozed into rubble.‚Äù

The taller one sneered. ‚ÄúYou think your little speeches matter? You‚Äôre not here to tell us what you think. You‚Äôre here to learn.‚Äù¬†

He leaned in so close Julius could smell the stale coffee on his breath.¬†

‚ÄúYou threatened the Reich. And now, Herr Neuburger, you will learn what that costs.‚Äù",2,1755887642.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

1mxeg2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1mxeg2c/explore_if_natural_elements_vinegar_really/,Explore If Natural Elements Vinegar Really Outperforms Cleaners,"If you‚Äôre someone who spends a fair amount of time tackling tough cleaning tasks or looking for eco-friendly alternatives to harsh chemicals, the **Natural Elements 30% Vinegar** might just land on your radar. Honestly, I had my doubts about whether vinegar with such high concentration would become a go-to in my daily cleaning arsenal. However, after incorporating it into my regular chores for a couple of weeks, it‚Äôs safe to say, there are significant **positives** and a couple of things one should keep in mind.

**Eco-Friendly and Seriously Potent Formula**  
This isn't your run-of-the-mill kitchen vinegar. It‚Äôs 6 times stronger than what you typically find at the grocery store. I used it to clean some stubborn soap scum in my bathroom, and the results genuinely surprised me. A quick scrub after letting the solution sit for a few minutes had the tiles looking nearly brand new. The high concentration also means it can be diluted depending on the task, making it quite versatile. For light cleaning around the house, I mixed one part of the vinegar with four parts water, and it still provided some solid cleaning power.

**Check Natural Elements 30% Vinegar price on Amazon.**

**Biodegradable and Multi-Purpose Uses**  
One thing I appreciate about this product is its eco-friendliness. Knowing that I‚Äôm replacing harmful chemicals with something biodegradable feels like a win-win. And let me tell you, the versatility of this concentrated vinegar is almost overwhelming in the best way possible. I tested its metal-cleaning abilities on some rusty garden tools last weekend. It worked wonders after soaking the tools for a few hours. Next, I tried cleaning my coffee machine‚Äîdiluted the vinegar, ran it through a cycle, and BOOM, it was like I just bought the thing yesterday.

**The Design Isn‚Äôt Eye-Catching but Gets the Job Done**  
Now, don‚Äôt expect flashy packaging. The four one-gallon jugs come in a pretty utilitarian design. It's clear this product is less about aesthetics and more about performance. I wasn‚Äôt really bothered by this since I usually prefer function over form. However, lugging around these larger jugs can be a bit of a mini workout. Storing four bulky containers required me to rethink my cleaning storage space, but hey, at least I don‚Äôt have to worry about running out for months!

**Pluses**  
- Strong enough to tackle heavy-duty grime without heavy scrubbing.  
- Helps remove hard water deposits and rust like a charm.  
- Can be customized (diluted) to suit lighter or more specific cleaning needs.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The strong vinegar smell during use can linger for a while, especially indoors.  
- Storage for the bulky gallon jugs wasn‚Äôt very convenient.  
- It‚Äôs so powerful that it can discolor or damage some surfaces, so spot-testing is crucial!

**Competing Products**  
Compared to traditional all-purpose cleaners on the market, this vinegar really steps up when it comes to natural cleaning without chemicals. Products such as high-concentration bleach or specialized grout cleaners might offer similar results, but many of them come with harsh chemical warnings. For example, I‚Äôve used a widely popular rust removal product in the past, and while it did the job, it also required ventilation and gloves because of the potential hazards. Here, all I needed was some water dilution and patience. That said, some eco-friendly competitors like castile soap or plant-based multipurpose cleaners don‚Äôt have the same industrial strength as this vinegar, so it depends on your priorities.

**Value for Money**  
If cost efficiency is your thing, this concentrated vinegar is definitely worth a nod. Since the formula can be diluted, each jug can last quite a long time. Combine that with its multitude of uses‚Äîcleaning grout, maintaining soil pH in gardening, unclogging faucets‚Äîyou‚Äôre looking at a product that pays for itself through versatility. However, you do need to weigh whether you‚Äôll make use of all its features. Without regularly tackling heavy-duty cleaning tasks, you might find the product overkill for daily maintenance.

1mxefvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShipandPilot/comments/1mxbj0d/freestar_collective_ship_fc911_condor/,[Relay Crosstalk 206 // Akila Skies // Flying Circus],"‚ÄúBaltic-Midori says they‚Äôve gone back to basics. That‚Äôs like a Terrabrew exec promising to ‚Äòjust make coffee.‚Äô History disagrees.‚Äù

The FC-911 Condor is supposed to be their clean slate: a Freestar contract, a ‚Äònormal‚Äô fighter, no artifact whispering in the avionics, no undead pilots stitched to the seat. Just wings, guns, and a paint job. What we got is basically a children‚Äôs drawing of a fighter with the landing gear erased because someone ran out of crayons.

This thing glides down like a stage magician refusing to reveal the trick, except the trick is gravity. Rumor has it the prototype was parked over Akila for two hours before engineers finally gave up and brought out a ladder.

This ‚Äòclassic‚Äô Freestar commission allegedly honors Akila‚Äôs legacy. Which part, exactly? The livestock? Because that brown-and-white paint job screams *‚Äòheritage cow‚Äô* more than *‚Äòheritage fighter.‚Äô* Strap some horns on it and you‚Äôve got yourself the first dairy-powered starcraft.

And because Baltic-Midori cannot resist stapling absurdity to fraud, they didn‚Äôt just build the Condor. They published their *own bootleg edition* of Ship & Pilot to advertise it. Not an ad buy. Not a partnership. Full magazine, logo and all. They didn‚Äôt just promote the Condor; they committed identity theft against an entire magazine.

But that‚Äôs apparently the Baltic-Midori brand. They‚Äôre a shipyard so allergic to originality they‚Äôre now plagiarizing entire periodicals. If they keep this up, expect next quarter‚Äôs catalog to feature a ‚Äú*Baltic-Midori Bible*‚Äù and an ‚Äú*Official Terrabrew Menu*‚Äù with hover-coffee that never touches the table.

What‚Äôs next‚Äîstealing the UC Vigilance hull and selling it as the ‚Äú*Baltic-Midori Vague-illance*?‚Äù

But don‚Äôt take the static from me. Here‚Äôs what the galaxy‚Äôs howling behind their hands:

**‚Äî Breaker‚Äôs Yard, Gagarin**  
*‚ÄúBaltic-Midori? Thought they only built ships you needed an exorcist to start.‚Äù*

**‚Äî Madame Sauvage‚Äôs Place, Neon**  
*‚ÄúThey made their own issue of Ship & Pilot? Please. Next they‚Äôll print their own bounty board and declare themselves most wanted.‚Äù*

**‚Äî Red Mile Betting Terminal**  
*‚ÄúNew Condor odds: 5-to-1 it catches fire before docking. 3-to-1 it faceplants in the demo. 10-to-1 Holson shows up to threaten the critics personally. 20-to-1 Baltic-Midori sues the concept of flight for defamation‚Äù*

**‚Äî Stoneroot Inn, Akila City**  
*‚ÄúFreestar Rangers actually flew it? Guess bravery and bad judgment wear the same badge.‚Äù*

**‚Äî Neon Overflow Chatroom**  
*‚ÄúBaltic-Midori building ‚Äòtraditional fighters‚Äô is like Ryujin releasing a cookbook. Nobody asked, and it‚Äôs probably poison.‚Äù*

**‚Äî Gagarin Landing Docks ‚Äì Slip 14B**  
*‚ÄúLanding gear‚Äôs expensive, right? Probably cut it to fund Holson‚Äôs anti-Crosstalk tantrum budget.‚Äù*

**‚Äî The Rock, Akila**  
*‚ÄúCondor‚Äôs supposed to honor Akila? I didn‚Äôt know that Akila‚Äôs heritage is face-planting in slow motion.‚Äù*

**‚Äî Red Mile Private Chat**  
*‚ÄúThey cloned Ship & Pilot? Perfect. Now I‚Äôm waiting for them to release their own knockoff Porrima Run, where the only race is which ship crashes first.‚Äù*

**‚Äî Neon Overflow Chatroom**  
*‚ÄúCondor: It doesn‚Äôt fly. It doesn‚Äôt land. It just‚Ä¶ loiters.‚Äù*

The Condor isn‚Äôt a fighter. It‚Äôs a brand apology written in stolen fonts.

So, when you can‚Äôt get the artifact to fly, steal the masthead instead.

Cal shut the lid. He swallowed twice hard. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre calling it in,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are,‚Äù I said.¬†

We didn‚Äôt. He went inside to wash. I stood with my phone in my hand and the words 9-1- DON‚ÄôT.¬†

That night we got the horn again. Two little coughs of sound. Then a third, longer, like¬† someone clearing his throat. Something brushed the trailer‚Äôs skirting. The cats hid where cats¬† go when the weather‚Äôs not the problem.¬†

‚ÄúTake it back,‚Äù Cal said. It came out like a suggestion. ‚ÄúTake the tote back. Put it in the bed.¬† Strap it down. Leave the keys in the ignition. Problem solves itself.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDoes it?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd if the problem now knows our yard, our faces, our license plate? If¬† the problem was always going to be solved by us?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThen we don‚Äôt make it worse,‚Äù he said, quieter. ‚ÄúWe put it back.‚Äù¬†

We loaded the tote. Every time it shifted it made a cheap liquid slap. We tried to listen for the¬† difference between slosh and something else moving under there. The lid was locked again¬† with the one spare we had.¬†

We drove without headlights until the road demanded otherwise. The quarry lay there with its¬† open mouth. The F-150 was gone.¬†

Cal said, ‚ÄúGoddamn it.‚Äù

We climbed out. Wind slapped us around. The gate moaned, one hinge torn loose. I was¬† about to say we should call someone, the deputy with the lazy eye or the pastor with the bolt¬† cutters, when the headlamp came on in the trees. It was close enough to paint our faces this¬† time. I raised my hands like surrender. Cal didn‚Äôt. He folded his arms and smiled his dumb¬† grin.¬†

The light went up and down like it was nodding hello.¬†

The bareheaded man stepped into the open. I recognized him now. Name‚Äôs Arlen. Used to¬† raise beagles for rabbit season. Used to sell logs off other people‚Äôs land. Used to show up¬† places with cash and a smile and a kind of gravity that made people say yes.¬†

‚ÄúEvening,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou boys hauled my groceries.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want trouble,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe brought it back. Took nothing.‚Äù¬†

Arlen looked at Cal when I said we took nothing. He could smell lies the way your dog¬† smells rain. He made a small disappointed face, like a dad when you forget his birthday.¬†

He lifted one hand. There were men on both sides of us now. I didn‚Äôt see where they came¬† from. The horn blatted twice from somewhere past the fence, then twice more from behind¬† us, and I understood it wasn‚Äôt a signal for help. It was a call-and-response to let each other¬† know where they were in the dark.¬†

‚ÄúYou opened it,‚Äù Arlen said, not a question.¬†

‚ÄúWe locked it,‚Äù Cal said, weirdly proud.¬†

‚ÄúYou fed?‚Äù Arlen said.¬†

I found my mouth. ‚ÄúFed what,‚Äù I said, and it came out brittle.¬†

Arlen looked bored. ‚ÄúDogs,‚Äù he said, and whistled. The sound went down the quarry like a¬† knife and came back wrong. Something moved in the black water.¬†

‚ÄúYou fight them?‚Äù Cal said, his voice tight and a little too excited, and I hated him then for¬† that piece of him that always wanted to see the thing you‚Äôre not supposed to see.¬†

‚ÄúTraining,‚Äù Arlen said. ‚ÄúCoyotes get bold when the snow‚Äôs deep. I like to keep the pack¬† mean.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre using people,‚Äù I said.¬†

Arlen shrugged. ‚ÄúPeople use people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI keep what the road gives me. You keep what¬† the bank gives you.‚Äù He looked at Cal again. ‚ÄúYou kept something.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt,‚Äù Cal said.

Arlen‚Äôs smile didn‚Äôt change. His eyes did. He nodded at the quiet one, who wasn‚Äôt quiet¬† now‚Äîhis boots thundered on the snow as he came at Cal low and fast. It took both of them¬† over in a white spray. I took a step forward and another man put a hand on my chest, gentle¬† as a coach. I swung. He stepped back and let my fist find air.¬†

‚ÄúStop,‚Äù Arlen said, and they did, like he had the remote for the world. Cal sat on his ass in the¬† snow with a dark smear on his cheek and his hands open. The quiet one had his boot on the¬† tote.¬†

‚ÄúYou kept something,‚Äù Arlen said again, to me this time.¬†

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, and it was true and it wasn‚Äôt. I hadn‚Äôt, but in my head I had‚Äîevery Polaroid I‚Äôd¬† ever seen at a yard sale of a buck hung by its hocks, every grin with a tongue in it, every¬† freezer you opened that didn‚Äôt hold food anymore but a story about what people do when¬† nobody says no.¬†

Arlen sighed. He looked almost sad. ‚ÄúYou left prints,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou left smell. My dogs got¬† it already. You can bring it to me now, or they can bring you to me. I don‚Äôt much care.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat,‚Äù Cal said, too fast. ‚ÄúWhat smell.‚Äù¬†

Arlen didn‚Äôt even look at him. He looked at me. ‚ÄúWatch,‚Äù he said, and pointed.¬†

He gave the smallest whistle. The quiet one kicked the tote. The lid jumped. Something¬† inside answered the kick like it had a temper. Arlen whistled again, clicked his tongue twice.¬† Down in the quarry something climbed iron rungs you couldn‚Äôt see unless you knew right¬† where to look. First a head, all scar tissue and eyes like coins. Then a chest with fur in¬† patches and bite marks like map pins. Then another. And another. Dogs, but wrong, long and¬† thin and cobbled out of hunger and practice. They flowed over the fence and waited with¬† their ears flat, polite as church.¬†

‚ÄúFeed only,‚Äù Arlen said. ‚ÄúYou opened when you should have fed.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDogs don‚Äôt eat people,‚Äù I said. Stupid thing to say while they looked at me like a menu. ‚ÄúDogs eat what you tell them,‚Äù Arlen said. ‚ÄúPeople too.‚Äù¬†

It was the last sentence that lit something in me like a dry field. The piece of Cal that had¬† smiled on the horn blasts. The way he asked if they fought dogs. The long afternoons when¬† he disappeared and came back with money he didn‚Äôt want to talk about. I looked at him hard¬† enough to make a bruise.¬†

‚ÄúWhat did you keep,‚Äù I said.¬†

He didn‚Äôt answer. He didn‚Äôt have to. I saw it in his coat pocket, the little bulge, the shape you¬† only recognize if you‚Äôve handled a lot of them. A tooth. Not a deer‚Äôs. Too square. Human,¬† drilled through with a bit of wire, strung on a chain. A trophy to press between his fingers¬† when he wanted to remember who he‚Äôd been with.

I loved my brother. I wanted to take his head off his shoulders and throw it in the quarry.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get it,‚Äù I said to Arlen, and raised my hands again slow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you.‚Äù I nodded¬† toward the yard like the yard was neutral ground in this. ‚ÄúYou can come if you want.‚Äù¬†

Arlen looked at the tote, then at me. He shook his head once. ‚ÄúTonight,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow. Or I¬† put you in the water and the dogs learn you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLet me go alone,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll run if he sees you.‚Äù¬†

Arlen considered. Finally: ‚ÄúThe quiet one goes with you. You try anything, he stops the¬† trying.‚Äù¬†

They let us walk to the rig. Cal started to say something. I didn‚Äôt look at him. The quiet one¬† climbed in the back, feet planted on the frame, a boot heel drumbeat on the steel that kept¬† time with my pulse.¬†

We drove. The snow made the world a tunnel. Two horn blasts sounded somewhere behind¬† us like someone saying amen.¬†

At the yard I pulled in too fast and clipped our mail box. The quiet one didn‚Äôt flinch. I got out¬† slow. I left the truck idling. I went up the trailer steps and felt each one like a count. Inside I¬† went to the bedroom and opened the drawer where people put the things they should throw¬† away. The chain lay there with the tooth on it, heavy and ugly. Cal must have tucked it under¬† my socks like I was his mother. I wrapped it in an old gym sock and came back out holding it¬† like a bird I didn‚Äôt want to frighten.¬†

The quiet one stood in the doorway like a bad thought. He held his hand out. I gave him the¬† bundle. He pinched it. He grunted once. He tucked it in his coat and we started down the¬† steps.¬†

I had a hammer right there by the door for when the latch froze. My hand found it without¬† thinking. The quiet one‚Äôs head turned a quarter inch toward the noise my fingers made on the¬† handle. That was all I had. I swung. He put his arm up and I hit bone and then him and the¬† rail at once, a three-note chord. He folded, quiet as ever, and slid under the steps.¬†

I didn‚Äôt check if he was breathing. I ran.¬†

The rig still idled. I climbed in. Cal was in the passenger seat because he‚Äôs always where he¬† shouldn‚Äôt be. His face was blank like he‚Äôd fallen asleep with his eyes open. The yard gate was¬† open. The road was a throat. I jammed my foot down and the truck lurched, and behind us I¬† heard it: two short blasts of a horn, then another answering two, then another, the sound¬† bouncing off trees, off houses, off the cold itself.¬†

They‚Äôre not coyotes. Coyotes don‚Äôt own the dark the way those men do. Coyotes don‚Äôt teach the dark to eat what you tell it.

I‚Äôm posting this from a motel that smells like burnt coffee and old soap. The deadbolt doesn‚Äôt¬† line up but I dragged the dresser in front of the door. There‚Äôs a hum in the bathroom from the¬† mini-fridge. I keep thinking it‚Äôs the tote, even though I left it at the quarry. I keep hearing that¬† horn, even though there are no cars in the lot but mine.¬†

If you break down on County 12 after dark and somebody honks twice, don‚Äôt stop. And if¬† somebody you love smiles when you say the word *fight*, don‚Äôt go anywhere with him where¬† the only thing watching is trees.¬†

I think they followed the blood I left on the snow. Or they‚Äôre following the smell of the thing¬† I gave back. Or they‚Äôre following a rule older than roads: feed only. When something opens¬† you up, the world comes to see what‚Äôs inside.¬†

The horn just went off outside. Two short blasts. Then two more, closer, like an echo with¬† legs.¬†

I‚Äôm not going to open the door. I‚Äôm not going to feed.¬†

I‚Äôm not.

Starting a business can feel like climbing Mount Everest with a leaky backpack. The biggest challenge? Often, it‚Äôs the financial mountain looming before you even take the first step. But what if I told you that you can reach impressive heights without breaking the bank? Bootstrapping, or growing your business with minimal outside investment, is totally achievable. It‚Äôs about resourcefulness, creativity, and a whole lot of hustle. This guide is your sherpa, helping you navigate the terrain to maximize profits while keeping initial investment to a minimum.

**The Challenge:**

Let's face it: most of us aren't swimming in venture capital. Applying for loans can be a headache, and giving away equity early on feels‚Ä¶icky. The reality is, you're likely starting small, maybe even from your kitchen table. This means every dollar counts. You need to be lean, mean, and laser-focused on generating revenue while keeping costs as low as humanly possible. The good news? It *is* possible. It‚Äôs about leveraging free and low-cost tools and strategies to outsmart the competition, even those with deeper pockets.

**Turning Lemons into Lemonade: A Bootstrapping Blueprint**

This isn't about cutting corners; it's about smart corners. Think of it as building a skyscraper with recycled materials ‚Äì impressive, efficient, and environmentally sound (for your bank account, anyway).

*   **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Mastering the Art of the ""Free Tier""**

    *   **Embrace the Freemium Model:** Almost every essential online service offers a free tier, from email marketing platforms to CRM software. Utilize these to their fullest extent until you absolutely *need* to upgrade. Resist the urge to splurge on features you don't yet need.
    *   **Content is King (and Queen):** Ditch the expensive ad campaigns (for now). Focus on creating valuable, informative content that attracts your target audience organically. Think blog posts, helpful guides, engaging social media updates, and even short, informative videos.
    *   **Harness the Power of Social Media:** Social media platforms are essentially free billboards. Build a strong online presence by consistently sharing relevant content and engaging with your followers.
    *   **Networking Like a Ninja:** Attend industry events (even virtual ones) and connect with potential clients and partners. Networking can lead to collaborations and referrals, which are essentially free marketing.
    *   **Barter and Trade:** Got a skill someone else needs? Offer your services in exchange for theirs. This is a fantastic way to acquire essential resources without spending cash.

*   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:**

    *   **Example:** Sarah, a freelance graphic designer, used Canva's free version to create stunning visuals for her clients for the first six months of her business. She only upgraded to the Pro version when her client base grew significantly and she needed more advanced features.
    *   **Hypothetical:** John, a startup selling handmade soaps, bartered his soaps to a local coffee shop in exchange for promotional space on their counter. This significantly increased his brand visibility without spending a dime on advertising.

*   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:**

    *   **Pro-Tip:** Don't be afraid to ask for discounts or negotiate pricing with vendors. Many are willing to work with small businesses, especially if you build a strong relationship.
    *   **Common Pitfall:** Avoid shiny object syndrome. Don't get distracted by every new marketing tool or strategy that comes along. Focus on mastering a few core strategies and sticking with them.

*   **Canva:** A user-friendly graphic design platform with a robust free version, perfect for creating social media graphics, presentations, and marketing materials. It's invaluable for those without design experience.
*   **Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides):** A comprehensive suite of productivity tools that offers a free plan with ample storage and collaboration features. Essential for document creation, email management, and team collaboration.
*   **HubSpot CRM (Free Version):** A powerful customer relationship management (CRM) system that helps you organize and track your leads and customers. The free version offers essential features for sales, marketing, and customer service.
*   **Mailchimp (Free Version):** An email marketing platform that allows you to send newsletters and marketing emails to up to 2,000 subscribers for free. Essential for building your email list and promoting your products or services.
*   **LinkedIn:** A professional networking platform that's perfect for connecting with potential clients, partners, and investors. It's a powerful tool for building your personal brand and generating leads.

Customers: 

If your barista looks like she‚Äôs sick it‚Äôs probably cause she is. Throwing up is no longer a reason to miss work and they actively choose to only follow protocol when they‚Äôre being questioned.

Your 20-32oz cups are smaller than what they‚Äôre saying. 

If you order a cup without water it‚Äôs $1.00
If you want ice/water it‚Äôs $1.50

You don‚Äôt want 5 shots in 24oz? Too bad you‚Äôre still paying for 5 shots.

If you use your own cup tho, NO discount 

Go get your Lotus at the Chef store and make 20 drinks for the price of 2.  

Huckleberry smoothies are mostly vanilla syrup and milk. 

Your 32oz Cold brew only has 8oz of toddy and 8 oz of water. The rest is ice (+ flav and cream if you ask) On the recipe sheet it‚Äôs very clear to put ice in first so it‚Äôs not visually apparent that you‚Äôre getting fucked over. 

One time one of the employees had hand foot and mouth, and instead of closing the shop the managers told the PM baristas to clean everything themselves while customers were still coming through.

Potential Employees: 

Let‚Äôs start with the fact they choose to be a ‚Äúflexible and reliable job for a college student‚Äù Minimum 3 shifts a week 1 has to be a weekend. 6 hours long Great if that works, perfect. If you work a double 12hr shift you‚Äôre not guaranteed a break, nope you have to get permission to take a break. 

Oh wait your grandpa passed away? Unfortunately unless you find coverage for your shift your not going to be able to go to his funeral ( unless of course your favorite employee )

 I‚Äôve carried multiple jobs while working here and have been told on multiple occasions if my schedules over lap then my job not paying me minimum wage needs to be put on the back burner because ‚ÄúFloco needs to be your number one priority‚Äù 

Summer months and hot weather? Be prepared to work 6 hours straight with no break, alone selling $1k in coffee with a ac ‚Äúthat works‚Äù but most girls working in the summer get heat exhaustion. There policy on safety is bullshit. E. MO location got broke into and not a single message was sent out about watching for things when you first arrive, instead they chose to not tell any of their employees. 

If you‚Äôre working with a manager they still take tips 

Also just saw their prices just went up the ass, just a reminder your baristas hourly DIDN‚ÄôT go up.

Please be nice to the Baristas, they‚Äôre trying their best in an environment that truly could give less of a fuck. I‚Äôm looking at you Nate. Do better. ",96,1755887232.0,missoula,29,0.94,False

I woke up one morning and my face felt tight, like I‚Äôd been clenching it in my sleep. I went to the bathroom, flipped on the light, and saw it.

I was smiling.

Not like a happy smile. It was‚Ä¶ weird. A little too wide. My lips were stretched just enough to feel wrong, like my face was trying too hard. I figured I had a dream I couldn‚Äôt remember. Maybe I was grinding my teeth. Whatever. I brushed it off.

But it didn‚Äôt go away.

‚∏ª

By day three, I realized I hadn‚Äôt stopped smiling once. Not even while sleeping. I caught my reflection in the bus window and it was still there‚Äîthis tight, unnatural grin just stuck on my face like a mask. I started taping my mouth at night, hoping I could train my muscles to relax. Didn‚Äôt help.

By the end of the week, my cheeks were sore. I had blisters at the corners of my mouth from the skin splitting. My gums were dry. It hurt to talk, so I stopped doing that too. I just stayed quiet. Head down.

People started noticing.

They‚Äôd glance at me and quickly look away, like I was making them uncomfortable without saying a word. One lady on the subway stood up and moved two rows down the moment we locked eyes. I wasn‚Äôt even doing anything. Just sitting there. Still.

Then came Derek.

He was this drunk who used to hang around the gas station I worked at. You know the type‚Äîloud, belligerent, smelled like piss and old cigarettes. He always talked shit but never really did anything. That night, he stumbled in ranting about beer prices and taxes and how the government owed him something. I didn‚Äôt even say anything back.

I just smiled.
I didn‚Äôt try to. It just widened. My lips peeled back like something inside me was laughing.

Derek stopped mid-rant.
He blinked a few times.
Then he said, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is wrong with your face?‚Äù

I remember that line exactly because he said it like he wasn‚Äôt joking. It wasn‚Äôt even angry. It was scared. I‚Äôve never seen someone go from loud to terrified that fast.

He backed up. Fast. Knocked over a chip stand. Then he bolted. I watched him through the glass doors. He was screaming.

Like full-body panic.
Like something was chasing him.

Then he dropped. Just collapsed in the parking lot. Dead. No one touched him. No wounds. No blood. Nothing.

The coroner said seizure. Some underlying condition maybe.
But I know what I saw.
And I know what did it.

‚∏ª

After that night, I started noticing other things. Little things.

Whenever someone saw my face for too long‚Äîreally looked at it‚Äîsomething happened. Not always instant. But eventually, they‚Äôd crack. One by one.

A kid on the bus saw me and had a panic attack so bad they had to stop the whole route. A woman in a coffee shop dropped her drink, stared at me shaking, and then locked herself in the bathroom for over an hour.

And then they started dying too.
I didn‚Äôt touch them. I didn‚Äôt do anything.

But they died. And the way they died‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt clean.

One guy scratched out his own eyes in an alley.
One girl jumped off a roof and survived the fall, only to scream until her throat tore open and she choked on her own blood.
Another man ran into traffic. When they pulled his body from under the semi, his face was still twisted in this expression like he‚Äôd seen something so awful, his brain just broke.

And every time someone died‚Ä¶ I felt it.

Not sadness. Not guilt.
Something worse. Like a pulse behind my eyes. Like a door opening inside me that I didn‚Äôt remember locking.
And then I started seeing the shadows.

‚∏ª

The first one showed up after the girl on the roof. I was walking home and passed by a playground. It was midnight, cold, and dead silent. Swings creaking with no wind. One of them was moving.

I stopped. Watched it.

Then I saw her. Not the girl. Not exactly.

She had her shape, but not her eyes. Her face was wrong. She didn‚Äôt blink. Her mouth was stuck open like she was still screaming, only there was no sound.

She turned toward me slowly. Didn‚Äôt speak. Didn‚Äôt move.

Then she smiled. Same as mine.

‚∏ª

It got worse from there.

Now every time someone dies, something gets left behind. A shadow. A presence. A walking, breathing version of the fear that killed them. They don‚Äôt talk. They don‚Äôt eat. They just follow me. They wait. And the worst part?

I can control them.

I didn‚Äôt know I could at first. But one day, this guy tried to mug me in an alley. Pulled a knife, said give him my wallet. I didn‚Äôt even blink. I just smiled.

He saw it. He really saw it.

Then the girl appeared behind him. The screaming one. He turned, and I swear to God, he pissed himself before he even dropped.

She didn‚Äôt touch him. But he was dead in seconds.

And I knew right then:
These things listen to me.

Now I have dozens. All different. All born from fear. Every single one made from someone who saw my smile and didn‚Äôt make it out.

I don‚Äôt know what they are.
I don‚Äôt know what I am anymore.

‚∏ª

I tried ending it.

I tried stabbing myself in the face. Over and over, mirror smashed in the bathroom, blood everywhere. But the smile didn‚Äôt break. It didn‚Äôt bleed. It just kept stretching.

I tried hanging myself. Rope snapped.

I tried drowning. The water boiled.

I haven‚Äôt slept in days. Weeks maybe. The shadows whisper now. They crawl along my ceiling at night and tug at my sheets like children. I think they want more.

I can‚Äôt stop smiling.
And people can‚Äôt stop looking.

‚∏ª

Please. If you see someone on the street with a grin that‚Äôs too wide‚Ä¶
If it looks off. Like their mouth is too long. Like their eyes aren‚Äôt matching the expression.

Don‚Äôt look back.

Because if you see me‚Äî
Really see me‚Äî
Your fear becomes real.

And once it becomes real,
It doesn‚Äôt go away.
It joins the rest.

And it follows me forever.",7,1755886976.0,creepypasta,0,0.9,False
1mxe8mr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxe8mr,My Trip to Kodaikanal,"I was pulling my hair out of stress the whole week, and finally got to my saturation point at the end of a weekend. Booked bus to kodaikanal past midnight. I have been to kodaikanal so many times in my life since my hometown is madurai, so this time I was going just for vibes, not to cover any tourist places.

Day 1: I didn't sleep the whole night after booking the bus, got ready early in the morning to catch 7 am bus in Periyar bus stand, those morons didn't specify where in Periyar though, kept on calling them, the bus operators didn't pick up,and  there was no sign of bus, it was already 7.30, cursed those morons and took an auto to Arapalayam bus stand, from there I got on batlagundu bus, there are straight buses available too,but I was in no mood to wait, reached batlagundu in 1.30 hours, from there I took another bus to kodaikanal. I reached kodaikanal around 12 pm, had lunch in a small hotel in the bus stand amd reached my stay. Checked in,Refreshed up, and went to the lake side, strolling thorough the souvenir shops never gets boring for me, sat there for about an hour and bought lots of fruits and went back to my stay. I'm a very scaredy cat of a solo traveller, I don't like staying out till late night out,especially if it's not a city. 

Day 2: Had a great godtier sleep the previous night, got ready by 8 am and went to coakers walk, by the time I went, no crowd was there,Had a very peacefull walk there,one of the main thing in my itinerary was eating a good pizza, saw many reels and good reviews about George's gourmet pizza that was started by an Italian, I had to try it, it was about 3km from coakers walk, decided to take a walk there,after a long peacefull stroll I reached the place in an hour, oh boy!the reviews were true, it was so yummy, after gobbling the whole pizza,I was in no mood to walk back, thought I would grab a cab, but no cab was in sight, started walking back, I really left like a garfield who demolished several lasagna,wanted nothing but to take nap, so decided to get lift, so many guys passed by in their bikes, I was waiting and judging who would be the safest option, finally an old uncle with typical tamil forehead vibooti came, stopped him and requested him to drop me nearest to the busstand on his way, idk where he was going,but bro was kind enough to drop me in the bus stand, it was around 1 pm, I was again feeling adventurous and decided to visit mannavanur lake , got on kaunji bus after confirming it stops at mannavanur, the journey took 2.30 hours, got down at the village bus stop, amd the lake was 1 km away, started walking, first phone network was completely gone, and then noticed nobody else was walking in that path, Only cars with boys,  I did not feel it was good idea to walk without even network, while traveling solo, i always trust my gut even that means  some setbacks, went to bus stop, waited there for 30 mins, the bus I came by ,was returning from kaunji, got on it and returned back to kodaikanal. Had a nice hot dinner in a very small restaurant and came back to my stay.


Day 3: last day of my short trip, I did not want to go back at all, I was in great dilemma the whole morning whether I should extend my stay, but I had to return, checked out by 11 am, and decided to do some cafe hopping, went to kantina cafe, tried their Boba coffee,it was OK. Then went to 10 degrees cafe, seeing the reviews, food there disappointed me big time, but the dessert I ordered coconut mousse was fire. After that lunch, walked back to busstand, there was a madurai bus waiting, got on it. The ticket costed Me only 100rs. The journey took 3.30 hours and again I'm back home. It was a very short but a very Refreshing trip. 

If you wanted to do sightseeing, cabs have a package for 2.5k-3k to take you around all the places, that Rate is standard.

When I was in Quebec City, in 4 days I ate 9 croissants and 3 pastries made with mille fuelle and I was in heaven. They were filled with home made nutella, regular nutella, passion fruit, raspberry cream, local sour cherry, and even liquid caramel. 

Norimoto, Night Moves, Standard, Bake Maine, Coffee Me Up, and even BLVL, paled in comparison to the bakeries in Quebec. I've probably gone to 50 bakeries in Maine over the 18 years I've lived here, so I consider myself a pastry expert (aka fat kid).

1mxe587,https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1mxe587/why_wednesday_becoming_tylers_master_isnt_a_bad/,Why Wednesday becoming Tyler's master isn't a bad idea.,"I saw some comments here in the community talking about this once, and I've seen some videos of people talking about it, so I decided to make a post about it.

Come on, guys; I know you'd really like a standalone redemption arc coming from Tyler himself, but *there's only a 10% chance of that happening,* and if it did, it would seriously **break the very foundations of the series' universe.**

**Tyler is a Hyde**. Hydes are awakened by their masters, so all their autonomy and self-control are in the hands of this other individual. Hydes **NEED** masters to stay in place, and what we'll see in part 2 is *what happens when a Hyde doesn't have a master.* In other words, if Tyler doesn't find a new master, **he'll suffer greatly and even die.**

***Why didn't Tyler go insane in the first season?*** Because even though Laurel controlled him, he was still experiencing something outside of it, because Laurel kept his Hyde side in check (and manipulated him psychologically, that bitch). Tyler worked at the coffee shop, had his hobbies, went to therapy, went to Rave'N with Wednesday, went on dates with her... he had good moments up until a certain point. Moments that happened AT THAT moment because he was in control. *That's why he didn't go crazy.*

This season, he's been abandoned by everyone, locked up in Willow Hill like a dog, and kept away from Laurel. It was this time away from her that broke the connection; *it was where he began to understand things.* Being alone was the first step toward madness, and now that he's free out there, it's only a matter of time.

Honestly, Tyler is in no mental condition to deal with this alone. Anyone who would allow themselves to feel remorse after doing something like what Tyler did and went through would want to commit *~~suicide~~*. It's a guilt compounded by all the problems he's going through that he couldn't handle. He's probably hallucinating, torn between who Hyde is and who he is, blinded by the lies of his own mind, and he no longer trusts anyone. After all, anyone who becomes his master will use him for insane things and treat him like nothing.

And that's where Wednesday being his master would change everything; *she's the only person who can* ***REALLY*** *stop him*. The only person with a real emotional connection to him and whom he can somehow trust. Obviously, she wouldn't be ideal, but the masters' emotions drive how the Hydes behave; Wednesday's colder nature would help him deal with it better. Besides, in practice, Wednesday would be the control and restraint he would have to stop killing more people, and by stopping this bloodlust and having a support network, he could then go through a surrender arc. *She stops him, becomes his master, and restrains him until he puts his head back on.*

I believe the only plausible surrender arc at the moment would be after she becomes his master. Not because ""she fixes him,"" but because he will be welcomed by her, by the Addams, he will not be surrounded by people who will judge him for who he is or what he was, and that is what will make him go through a process of personal recognition, like, *""Okay, I was a monster. I killed people. I betrayed those I loved. I was used, manipulated, and abandoned. But I don't want that to dictate who I am. This is not who I am.* ***So who am I?""***

It is then in this process that we will get to know the Tyler he always was, or, at best, the Tyler he can be.",19,1755886757.0,weyler,15,0.92,False

1mxe4qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1mxe4qo/the_rise_of_the_nuanced_mormon/,"The Rise of the ""Nuanced"" Mormon","I'd like to talk about this trend I've seen in arising throughout Mormon communities in Utah where people are starting to align themselves with more ""nuanced"" views of the church.

There are some coffee drinkers, some swearers, some who have been open about queer relationships, some who I have heard state that they've stopped saying ""I know"" and started saying ""I believe"", and then there's even crazier circumstances where Mormons I know are tripping balls on mushrooms or cracking open a beer to relax for the night. 

Obviously there are members who aren't that invested and might just be called ""jack-mormons"", but there are Mormons who are invested who have started straying from the cookie cutter paths of Mormonism for sometimes very odd reasons that, as an ex-mormon, makes me frustrated for the fact that **nuance amidst the objective claims that all religions make will always cause a schism between your beliefs and integrity.** Like how can you live like that? My only hope is that this dissonance might be enough to push nuance over the edge into authentic living. 

First, I have to give credit where credit is due. There's a couple good reasons I've seen people become more open and loose with their religious strictures. There's a mental health crisis of course! People are losing it. Some Mormons are losing it, and I think a lot have realized that doing what their parents did as devout Mormons is a vain attempt towards their aspirations of happiness or fulfillment. 

We've seen this mirrored through the changes the church has implemented like the shorter sleeved garments that allow people to diversify their wardrobe and expression just a bit more. All in all changes in society and the growing focus on mental health and freedom could change Mormonism for good as the rising generations of believers have seemed to just start calling bullshit on the statement ""I *know*"" while trying to preserve their beliefs. 

I'm sure a lot of us even as ex-mormons or atheists/agnostics can say we like the teachings of Christ, and another reason I've seen nuance arrive is because **so do some Mormons.** For some, their belief in what Christ taught is enough to keep their Mormon status, and I honestly kind of fuck with that? It also seems like people ARE picking and choosing the parts of Mormonism they like and refuse to align themselves wholly with what it preaches. 

This has been a huge theme in my family, as all of them have struggled with mental health and it has led almost every single one into nuance. They've been using mushrooms, THC gummies, swearing, and making comments like saying ""I've stopped saying ""I know"" the church is true"" or a couple other things you'd NEVER imagine devout Mormons saying but from as far as I can tell... they all are believers. 

Has anyone else seen this? It's kind of breaking my world due to the fact that my family is doing all of what I mentioned previously. I just get baffled by the fact that, for example, some people can't see that if God speaks to prophets, and told one of them to ban black people for a century, and you believe in equality and inclusion but now stay in the church just for your belief in Christ... that you can't feel incredibly hypocritical for choosing to ignore the mountain of un-Christlike doctrines preached by Mormonism. 

LEAVE FOR CHRIST'S SAKE (literally).

1mxe44z,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mxe44z/manuka/,Manuka,"He answered our prayers during the dust bowl. Our town suffered as most did in Kansas. My parents moved out here when they found out I was on the way: caught up in the great wave of folks beckoned by the cheap land. My dad staked ours, set up a shack to live in, and cleared our families path. Not long after they found themselves a schedule: he would get up at 4am every morning, have coffee at the diner until 6, work in the fields for 12 hours, then rest. Mom did everything else. And that‚Äôs how life went on, not even tripped up when I was born. The dirty thirties; however, laid us flat.

It's known how the story of the dust bowl goes. Farmers over cultivated their lands with unhealthy practices, in the hopes they‚Äôd have enough product to compensate for the depression. Our town was no different, and in retaliation, fate dwindled our crops and gutted the yield. The plants were sad and sickly: dwarfen corn on brittle brown stalks, stingy soy and pinto beans. We seemed to harvest as much rotten produce as the salvageable stuff. The fowl piles grew in multiplicity and stature, too much at one time to prepare for composting.

We prayed every lull in time we came across. On days when dad had to come in from the field early: dust caked into every nook in his face, an involuntary moment of silence came over us. There was a storm that lasted for days, with an occasional forty-five minutes until the next wave would barrel towards us. The night that it ended, it was an hour after dusk when it just fizzled away. Its tirade evidenced by our half buried porch, orange film on our windows, a ramp over the neighbors cattle fence, and him.¬†

We were in the living room, a light, silent celebration of the break in the storm. That‚Äôs where we felt him. It was like taking a step with no stairs to catch our foot. At the drop of a pin something fell through us, a physical hollowing in our bodies, but also an emotional longing to fill that void. It beckoned us to look outside.

The crimson moon, bloodshot from the dust laced sky, permitted and reduced our witnessing of his only visit. The transit told of his appearance: the lighting, too inadequate to reveal greater details. What could be seen is his overzealous height. Emphasis given to the two visible, spindly appendages that made up three quarters of his body. He lumbered slowly towards us, the joints connecting the limps to the torso judged out drastically with every step: like popping an arm in and out of its socket. His torso dipped down between the limbs for a short distance before ending at an amputated stump. The core of the torso being vase shaped, bottled necking, then stretching into a thin plateau. If the plateau was a head, it laid flat like a crocodiles: structures branched out of either side, with a privity in sprawling upwards. The thick trunks closest to the body, wisping out into oblivion as its girth frittered.¬†

Moonlight shown through momentary vacancies in his body, blips of light that would flicker within his shadow, promptly filling back in. A hazy, hardly rendered web of flowing tendrils trailed off his center mass, riding along the thinning air. It could‚Äôve been our bodies giving into our minds desire to watch, neglecting our increasing need for air, but it felt as though the room became a vacuum in his wake. The whistle of the late storm's wind as it channeled through the ill fitted wood: had long since died down, now non-existent. Nothing made a sound in his presence.

He stood between our furthest fields, among the numerous and now embarrassing rot piles. A shameful representation of our inadequacies, laid out beneath him. From behind him rose two appendages, two obscure sticks, manifesting into tangible structures once they swung over his body. Their additional height now doubled his, but just for a moment, before they collapsed: buckingly halfway up, the heavy top coming down fast.¬†

They didn‚Äôt meet the ground with a thud, instead a hydraulic, slow approach. Long thin rods hoisted up by beams no thicker, resting on either side of the neck. The ends met our filth piles, he began to draw them in. The limbs, like two chopsticks, squeezing towards each other. When they rose again, a wad of cultivated death was held in their grasp. It swung back over his body, and disappeared behind his shadow.

It‚Äôs as if the moon turned down the lights as he left, obscured to the point of his form being nothing more than an afterimage. As he dwindled away, the rest of the world returned, all except for the storms. We heard the wind, gentle and whispering, the crickets, then our breath.¬†

¬†Not a word was said that night, not out of bewilderment; it would‚Äôve been unnecessary to do so. Words would be needed for someone who didn‚Äôt see him: we felt our explanation. Once the spell was lifted it felt like we had gained fifty-pounds; an intense exhaustion followed. Although I don‚Äôt imagine any of us slept; a part of us still watching from the window. We didn‚Äôt talk at breakfast either, our faces may have worn an expression commonplace in the 30s, but our eyes were coated with a photographic cataract, a picture of him. The first word spoken that day was from my father when his distant howler, and footsteps grew louder, puttering in the dustfall that still blanketed our land. Mom and I, cleaning the grime off our porch, looked up to see a traditionally silent and unenergetic man: waving, panting, and yelling about something in the field.

We took off in his direction, when we met him, his breathless gasps couldn‚Äôt carry any words, so he turned and ran back the way he came. When we made it to the scene, he hunched over his knees, spitting and coughing: the sounds of an aging man using his body in a way he hadn‚Äôt in years. His fit became an afterthought when we made sense of the display. Where a graveyard of rotten plants stood days before, no longer had a trace of the useless matter. In its spot were numerous perfectly bundled stacks of: corn, soybeans, and wheat. They were radiant, nearly a manufactured perfection: large ears, vibrant colors, a sweet aroma. All the piles were like this, and they would be for every day to come, as long as we left something in exchange.

Camping:
Stayed at apgar campground for six nights. Had to move sites 3 times to fill my six night timeline but was worth it.

Highlights: right off of lake McDonald. We loved spending time on the lake, kayaking, boating, swimming, throwing rocks (my 3 year old loved.)

Walking distance to apgar village (coffee,ice cream, restaurants, camp store, etc.)

Walking distance to Apgar visitor center and GTTSR Shuttle. 

Downside: 3 showers for almost 1,000 person campground. üôÑ

Hikes:
Virginia falls- beautiful, not challenging, other side of the park. There is a spot to jump off a bridge if that‚Äôs your thing. 

Highline trail to Grinnell Glacier overlook, granite park chalet, to the loop. Just under 15 miles. Took us 5hrs 50minutes. HIGHLY recommend. Beautiful scenery, strenuous hike, bring bear spray water and snackies. 

Took shuttle to Logan and then shuttle out from the loop. 

Avalanche lake: once again. Beautiful hike, extremely rewarding hike, not challenging, 5 miles round trip. Challenging to find parking. Used this hike for our recovery after Highline. 

Hidden lake: starts at Logan pass. Very easy, lots of traffic, people see bears here, we did not. 


We attempted to get backpacking permits. We had actually acquired some but then were denied due to bear activity. The permit office said they could exchange them out for another trail. We didn‚Äôt pack the right gear for backpacking and they said we would have to show our gear to them. Sad, but maybe next time!

Then we stayed at an Airbnb in whitefish. We loved spending to dabble in ‚Äúroughing it‚Äù and then being boujee. We could knock out laundry before our flight home. Absolutely loved whitefish. Perfect for train spotting (for my son)

Still went back into the park to enjoy it more. 

We did not get to experience many glacier, unfortunately but I feel we will be back!

My parents moved out here when they found out I was on the way: caught up in the great wave of folks beckoned by the cheap land. My dad staked ours, set up a shack to live in, and cleared our families path. Not long after they found themselves a schedule: he would get up at 4am every morning, have coffee at the diner until 6, work in the fields for 12 hours, then rest. Mom did everything else. And that‚Äôs how life went on, not even tripped up when I was born. The dirty thirties; however, laid us flat.

It's known how the story of the dust bowl goes. Farmers over cultivated their lands with unhealthy practices, in the hopes they‚Äôd have enough product to compensate for the depression. Our town was no different, and in retaliation, fate dwindled our crops and gutted the yield. The plants were sad and sickly: dwarfen corn on brittle brown stalks, stingy soy and pinto beans. We seemed to harvest as much rotten produce as the salvageable stuff. The fowl piles grew in multiplicity and stature, too much at one time to prepare for composting.

We prayed every lull in time we came across. On days when dad had to come in from the field early: dust caked into every nook in his face, an involuntary moment of silence came over us. There was a storm that lasted for days, with an occasional forty-five minutes until the next wave would barrel towards us. The night that it ended, it was an hour after dusk when it just fizzled away. Its tirade evidenced by our half buried porch, orange film on our windows, a ramp over the neighbors cattle fence, and him.¬†

We were in the living room, a light, silent celebration of the break in the storm. That‚Äôs where we felt him. It was like taking a step with no stairs to catch our foot. At the drop of a pin something fell through us, a physical hollowing in our bodies, but also an emotional longing to fill that void. It beckoned us to look outside.

The crimson moon, bloodshot from the dust laced sky, permitted and reduced our witnessing of his only visit. The transit told of his appearance: the lighting, too inadequate to reveal greater details. What could be seen is his overzealous height. Emphasis given to the two visible, spindly appendages that made up three quarters of his body. He lumbered slowly towards us, the joints connecting the limps to the torso judged out drastically with every step: like popping an arm in and out of its socket. His torso dipped down between the limbs for a short distance before ending at an amputated stump. The core of the torso being vase shaped, bottled necking, then stretching into a thin plateau. If the plateau was a head, it laid flat like a crocodiles: structures branched out of either side, with a privity in sprawling upwards. The thick trunks closest to the body, wisping out into oblivion as its girth frittered.¬†

Moonlight shown through momentary vacancies in his body, blips of light that would flicker within his shadow, promptly filling back in. A hazy, hardly rendered web of flowing tendrils trailed off his center mass, riding along the thinning air. It could‚Äôve been our bodies giving into our minds desire to watch, neglecting our increasing need for air, but it felt as though the room became a vacuum in his wake. The whistle of the late storm's wind as it channeled through the ill fitted wood: had long since died down, now non-existent. Nothing made a sound in his presence.

He stood between our furthest fields, among the numerous and now embarrassing rot piles. A shameful representation of our inadequacies, laid out beneath him. From behind him rose two appendages, two obscure sticks, manifesting into tangible structures once they swung over his body. Their additional height now doubled his, but just for a moment, before they collapsed: buckingly halfway up, the heavy top coming down fast.¬†

They didn‚Äôt meet the ground with a thud, instead a hydraulic, slow approach. Long thin rods hoisted up by beams no thicker, resting on either side of the neck. The ends met our filth piles, he began to draw them in. The limbs, like two chopsticks, squeezing towards each other. When they rose again, a wad of cultivated death was held in their grasp. It swung back over his body, and disappeared behind his shadow.

It‚Äôs as if the moon turned down the lights as he left, obscured to the point of his form being nothing more than an afterimage. As he dwindled away, the rest of the world returned, all except for the storms. We heard the wind, gentle and whispering, the crickets, then our breath.¬†

¬†Not a word was said that night, not out of bewilderment; it would‚Äôve been unnecessary to do so. Words would be needed for someone who didn‚Äôt see him: we felt our explanation. Once the spell was lifted it felt like we had gained fifty-pounds; an intense exhaustion followed. Although I don‚Äôt imagine any of us slept; a part of us still watching from the window. We didn‚Äôt talk at breakfast either, our faces may have worn an expression commonplace in the 30s, but our eyes were coated with a photographic cataract, a picture of him. The first word spoken that day was from my father when his distant howler, and footsteps grew louder, puttering in the dustfall that still blanketed our land. Mom and I, cleaning the grime off our porch, looked up to see a traditionally silent and unenergetic man: waving, panting, and yelling about something in the field.

We took off in his direction, when we met him, his breathless gasps couldn‚Äôt carry any words, so he turned and ran back the way he came. When we made it to the scene, he hunched over his knees, spitting and coughing: the sounds of an aging man using his body in a way he hadn‚Äôt in years. His fit became an afterthought when we made sense of the display. Where a graveyard of rotten plants stood days before, no longer had a trace of the useless matter. In its spot were numerous perfectly bundled stacks of: corn, soybeans, and wheat. They were radiant, nearly a manufactured perfection: large ears, vibrant colors, a sweet aroma. All the piles were like this, and they would be for every day to come, as long as we left something in exchange.

I rarely get any time to myself except after bed time and I have no friends currently because I don‚Äôt get out much, if fact its getting to where the only free time I have is when I have a doctors appointment. I love my mother, however I struggle greatly with the way she communicates. She has a tendency to drone on and on and on, and then gets upset with me when I tell her that she‚Äôs been going on long enough that I even forgot what she was talking about saying we rarely talk. I try to explain to her that if the conversation wasn‚Äôt all one sided I would probably talk to her all day if she wanted. To which she drags up one long explanation I gave to a question she had as me doing the same thing. With everything being done online lately I find myself several times a day trying to figure out what she messed up because she cant log into her bank or credit card accounts. Why she needs to check each account several times a day I have no Idea. On top of taking care of her, I‚Äôm also responsible to keep the vehicles running, the yard taken care of and repairs around the house, then theres the dogs! One thinks he owns everything and is constantly barking at the other two, despite having his voice box no longer working, it‚Äôs more like a forced cough rather than a bark. One of the others barks like a maniac every time someone walks by on the sidewalk or there is a dog on tv. The third is the biggest despite being only 2 years old, and he loves to pick on the other two. I get one to stop acting like an idiot and one of the others two takes advantage, its never ending!! Today, as I was trying to wake up drinking my morning coffee my mother hit me with a long list of stuff she wanted me to help with, and despite me trying to explain that I mentally wasn‚Äôt ready to deal with any of it, continued to go down her list of things she wanted help with then didn‚Äôt understand when I got upset and tried to explain to her that I was absorbing none of it and the more she went on the less I remember, but then continued to drone on about what she needed. When I finally got her to stop so I could take a beat and wake up she handed me this huge pile of paperwork and was like here, I wrote it all down‚Ä¶.. now she is brooding in her chair feeling unloved because I asked her to let me wake up first, nicely the first time, then progressively more aggressively as she continued to drone on after being asked nicely to wait. She claims we never talk anymore and I try to explain that me listening to her drone on is not us talking, it‚Äôs her talking! All I want is some time to myself every once in a while, and for her to realize that if she really wanted to talk to someone, she has a phone and three daughters, 5 sisters, and several friends that she could call and talk too, I am not the only one! She complains that we never go anywhere but then most people say we‚Äôre never home when they drive by. I go out to the garage to work on something and 30 minutes later she‚Äôs at the garage door checking to see if Im okay, we watch the same show several times a week but she swears its brand new just out today, until I can describe to her screen by scene what happens next. What makes it so very hard is that i myself am disabled, my disabilities are mental and keeps me from holding down a job and honestly I shouldn‚Äôt be the one sibling who takes care of her. I feel like Im closing down and becoming less me every day. I feel alone and overwhelmed and instead of a helping hand I get compliments. I don‚Äôt need compliments, I need a floatation device to keep my head above the water!!",5,1755886504.0,CaregiverSupport,2,0.86,False

This week, we had thousands of bottles of 'Liquid Fence' (literally rotten eggs and garlic in a bottle) blow up from the heat and leak all over every single product in the warehouse. Management didn't shut anything down and we sent out all of the products dripping in chemicals as long as they scanned (numbers over everything!)



Your new yoga matt? soaked.

Your coffee pods? Rotten Egg flavor!

Your stupid Amazon protein bars? You better believe it, garlic and eggs

It's HONESTLY just so stupid the kinds of stuff people buy from The House of Slaves instead of getting their dumb little protein bars from the store, and now they'll pay for it üòÇ
