by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) \*\*UFC 321 Preview: Ciryl Gane vs. Tom Aspinall – A Heavyweight Clash of Titans (and Betting Odds That Scream “Don’t Bet on the Frenchman”) \*\*

**Parse the Odds: A Statistical Yawn**  
Let’s cut to the chase: the numbers aren’t kind to Ciryl Gane. The decimal odds for this bout range from **3.8 (BetMGM)** to **4.2 (Caesars)** for Gane, translating to an implied probability of **23.8% to 25.6%**. Meanwhile, Tom Aspinall is the statistical equivalent of a vending machine—unstoppable and slightly intimidating—with odds between **1.24 (Caesars)** and **1.28 (DraftKings)**, implying a **76.9% to 80.6%** chance to win. To put that in perspective, Gane’s odds are about as optimistic as betting your morning coffee will survive a barista’s attempt to latte-art your name. Aspinall, on the other hand, is the barista with 10 years of experience and a PhD in “steam wand precision.”

**Digest the News: The “Third Time’s the Charm” Gambit**  
Ciryl Gane, the French MMA maestro, is no stranger to title shots. He’s already notched two losses to all-time greats (Francis Ngannou and Jon Jones), yet here he is, back for a third attempt, like a tourist who keeps ordering the same dish and *finally* hopes it won’t give him food poisoning. Gane’s game plan? Avoid the early chaos, use his ballet-dancer footwork to frustrate opponents, and wear them down with boxing that’s less “punching” and more “strategic jazz hands.” His weakness? Ground defense. If Aspinall can take him down, Gane’s BJJ (competent, but not elite) could become a sideshow of suffering.

Tom Aspinall, the English brute, is the reigning champion with a 15-3 record and a resume that includes a title defense against Curtis Blaydes. His only loss? A disqualification due to injury—a technicality, really. Aspinall’s style is “aggres

1og1a76,https://i.redd.it/odn8oljhebxf1.jpeg,Espresso chocolate chip cookies (dairy free),"I’ve made this recipe at least ten times this year - they’ve become my go-to!

Notes:
- To make these dairy free, I used Becel’s unsalted Dairy Free Plant Butter sticks
- I used silicon baking mats instead of parchment paper
- I measured all ingredients by weight vs cups
- I used Costco’s semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of dark chocolate
- I used dark brown sugar instead of light
- I used sunflower oil for this batch; I’ve made them with canola oil previously without issue
- I used Nescafé Gold Original Espresso instant coffee
- I’ve baked these on both dark and light cookie sheet. I personally prefer the cookies from the light sheet; the difference is very slight and just a personal preference! 

Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups (330 g) light brown sugar, (packed)
1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar
8 tablespoons (113 g or 4 oz or 1 stick) unsalted butter, (room temperature)
1/2 cup (112 g) sunflower or grapeseed oil 
1 tablespoon (13 g) real vanilla extract
1 to 2 tablespoons (6 to 12 g) espresso powder
2 large eggs (room temperature)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon sea salt
3 cups (405 g) all-purpose flour
2 cups (340 g) dark chocolate, (coarsely chopped or chips)
Sea salt flakes for the tops (optional)

Steps:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F and line several baking sheets with parchment paper or silicon baking mats.
2. Cream brown sugar, granulated sugar, butter, oil, vanilla and espresso powder on medium speed for about 4 to 5 minutes or until light in color and texture. Add the eggs, baking powder, baking soda and salt and mix on medium until everything is well blended, about 1 minute more.
3. Add the flour and mix until barely blended and you still see streaks of flour. Add the chopped chocolate/chocolate chips and mix until evenly distributed throughout. 
4. place 2-tablespoons of dough on the prepared baking sheet leaving ~2 inches (5 cm) of space between each. 
5. Bake for 11-12 minutes. They will look slightly underbaked. 
6. Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes, and then move to a wire rack to finish cooling. 
7. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt, if using

Two of my brothers and my mom also have it. I tried Adderall and Vyvanse initially but didn’t like them and stopped taking them after a month or so. I have been unmedicated since then up until about six months ago when my PCP offered to put me on Concerta. 

At the lowest dose I felt good. No more racing thoughts, lower anxiety, and I wasn’t getting a 2pm crash. Less emotional eating and I was still sleeping well at night. Suddenly I could make it through a convo without cutting people off whenever I had a thought. Then my anxiety started peeking through so my PCP suggested going up to the next dose. 

Today is my first day at 27mg. I am sweaty, jittery and heart pounding (though heart rate is normal), and my stomach is pretty upset. I did start the day with coffee which wasn’t smart I’m sure. But it makes me wonder - do others with ADD also feel this way on their meds? Or was I maybe misdiagnosed this whole time?",1,1761422810.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I never loved you. You were the one who kept pushing — to call, to meet, to talk — and then, once you finally got me physically, you started acting like some distant king, gaslighting me every time. Saying i can call you when i want but when i did you said, how wasted and lost i am having no goal in life. Brave of you to say this, the person who too feels lost. I want to be mean, you played games all day, went out, spend money on coffee, and things and still chill enough to pass time in your 30s and then you say i am not serious for life. Tbh, whenever you said this it hurt but then i felt you are a living example to it. If i walk down the same lane I'll end up next to you.

We matched about a month ago and since we’re both still in HS (I’m 19 and she’s 18) I randomly went to her school, which she was okay with and I hung out with her and her friend for HOURS. We went on an actual date without her friend ofc 2 days after and we both had so much fun; we walked around the city, talked, hugged a lot and held hands which was a cherry on top.

Today we met up again and went to a bookstore and a coffee shop and got to know each other even more. We also talked about what we expected from each other and we both agreed on something short term but still exclusive because of our education. I’m about to start a pilot program and I’m gonna get a part time job to pay for it so it wouldn’t be the best time for a serious relationship and she’s going to move to Ireland once she graduates, so we were both really glad that we were on the same page.

Anyways, by the end of the date we hugged but I instinctively went in to hug her because that’s what we always do when we part ways, but I noticed that she kinda raised her hand to cup my cheek but my dumbass just hugged her 😭. after the hug she actually cupped my cheek and looked at me for a bit before kissing me.

And my sexuality (which they are wrong about)
  — I started a new antidepressant and has been feeling ** THE BEST/ HAPPIEST IN OVER 10 YEARS ***… for only about **3 WEEKS** being depressed/ having very little self confidence of my body/ airways thinking I was fat, nobody would want me.  😭😭 it sucks. I’m Okay now & infinitely times better than I was on previous meds, but I just can’t get to that level of happiness again. 

I did gain about 15 pounds from increased appetite. When I asked other people for opinion, they ask said I look fine. My doctor says I’m fine and the weight will go down when I get used to the new med. 

Fucking assholes. I go above and beyond and take pride in helping the nurses as much as I can to lighten their load that other text could never do. 
Purposely asked for the hard patience that nobody else wants to deal with because they’re too rudeaggressive/high acuity. But then with me, they know how to act respectfully, know that when the nurse comes in their room, they will respect them, and will be cleaned thoroughly including simple wound care that is within my scope. I purposely shoo shoo the nurse away out of the room when they come in wanting to help clean patients because I’m **very particular** on how I like my patients patients cleaned and looking in the bed. 

** foreshadowing to the third unit I was trained on as a tech** 🤣I get so annoyed when someone is “helping” me and ending up having  the patient is not on the chuck right/ “bathed” with wipes only😭. Baby, if you’re my patient, I would’ve cleaned you up faster, you are getting bathed with a warm water, soap, and washcloths. 

Can’t stand the smell of shit in the air/uncomfortable and embarrassed patients that smell themselves

Have had countless nurses over the years saying that they never worked with a tech like me and when they see me assigned to them, they know it’s gonna be a great night.🙄

1og132n,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1og132n/what_do_i_try_next/,What do I try next?,"43m feel like I have run out of options, and I have no idea what to try next.  Long story short, I never have had any luck with women like At All. With therapy finally got enough confidence that I decided to try and ""fix myself"" to finally give myself a chance at finally getting an actual date and ideally a real relationship. Someone to do things with, and go places with, and talk to, a partner. Someone who likes me and just doesn't use me for attention or money or emotional support. 

Work Done
I spent a solid year re-shaping my body , lost 100lbs, bought new clothes, updated style. 

Worked on switching from and introvert to more of an extrovert. Going out more, talking to strangers, becoming comfortable doing public events solo.

Therapy, lots of therapy.

What I have tried (last year or so)

Online dating - Every app probably in existence 0 matches. Occasionally I go through my likes and if one seen maybe like it might work I will match and talk with them, and usually meet for coffee or a drink, but it becomes obvious why I would never have liked them in the first place. Usually personality differences, or more recently a lot of female catfishes. (I have done a ton of online profile reviews and it turns out I am simply unphotogenic. Nothing I do, even trying a professional photoshoot, fixes my weird photo smile. So I just think this is not fixable.)

Hobbies group / Volunteer - I do a couple different things kind of regularly like gym classes, and different meetup groups. Also help occasionally at some different events. All available women there have decided I am better off as friend.

In person - I started forcing myself to go out at least 3x a week to local bars or events. Also peruse local coffee shops, stores... really anywhere. Started with a goal of one cold approach a week, now average 10+ easily. This is the most profitable results wise, but also the most hurtful as not every interaction is positive. Probably gotten about 40-50 numbers /contact info out of the 300+ asks. Most turn out to just be Soo excited to have someone actually like come up to them at a store or something and are not actually looking to even go out for coffee or talk. All of the others only want to hookup. This did lead to my only real date in my life though. Which was wonderful , but eventually turned out to just be an extended hookup.

Singles events - I have done a couple meetup based singles events like meet and greet at bar and Just did speed dating. Everyone in the age range I can get into 40-60 tends to be on the 55+ side. The few my age always, always just want a hookup and are ""not really ready"" to date.

Friends - all married and know no single people. Also don't have many as they have all gotten sick of having a constang 3rd or 5th wheel hanging around.

Summary 
In the last year, really ramping up in the last 3 months I have swiped probably 10k times on various apps. Approached hundreds of women in the wild, and done every singles events I can find. Yet can't find one girl I would like who would actually want a date. All women my age seen to be ""broken"" from a divorce, or too busy with kids to actually have a real realtionship. All slightly younger women are burnt out from dating apps and they seem to honestly hate men. The rest just want a hookup.  For some reason the main group attracted to me is married women and women 25 and younger, not exactly relationship material.

So what do I try next? In general the feedback I get from all my female friends (growing list by the week) is there is nothing wrong with me, I just haven't found the right one. The ones who have known me longer says My biggest problem is just not being positive as it will happen, but even their tune has begun to change in the last few months watching me strike out over and over and over. My therapist is suggesting moving to a new city, but I just finally bought a house and have family to take care of here.  I honestly don't know what to do next, and don't want to just go back into my shell and give up like I did for the prior 10-15 years. I just have no clue where any actual single normal women who would be open to a normal, nice , amazing guy are.

I can't attach pics in this forum apparently, as I know that would be the first question asked

This is my second post, but this project took on a life of it's own and I added soooo much more.  After years of manually refreshing Bandsintown and frantically checking if Goose was swinging back through my area, I finally caved and built something better: **TourGuides** — a concert-tracking app that somehow turned into a full-blown touring companion.

Tour Guides - [www.prinly.com](http://www.prinly.com) no login required, search for your artist, click on a tour date and see the guide.

If you want to give it a shot without reading everything you can signup at:  
[https://prinly.com/auth?mode=signup](https://prinly.com/auth?mode=signup)

Install a PWA app for faster loading  
[https://prinly.com/install](https://prinly.com/install)

Here’s what it does:

# 🗺️ Main Feature (no login required) AI-Powered Tour Guides

Every show comes with its own **custom AI city guide**, built for the pregame, the post-game, and the hangover recovery:

* Pre-show eats and bars 🍔🍺
* Late-night spots for the “one more song” crowd 🌙
* Morning-after coffee shops ☕
* Hotels, parking, and rideshare info 🚗
* Local sights, dispensaries (where legal), and general town flavor 🌆
* Interactive map with everything pinned and ready

Basically, your own personal tour manager that doesn’t flake or eat your snacks.

# 🎯 Other Core Features

* **Track your favorite artists** (Goose, Phish, Billy, whoever) and instantly see all upcoming shows
* **Search by location** — pick a city or radius (10 miles  to Nationwide) so you only see shows you can actually hit
* **Real-time updates**
* **Mark shows as attended** and build your own concert history — basically your jam-CV

# 📊 Concert Stats & Analytics

This is where it gets dangerously nerdy:

* See your **most-heard songs**, **rare catches**, and “**how have I still not heard that?**” tracks
* Track **venue and city stats** — how many times you’ve seen Goose at the Cap vs the Mann
* **Year-over-year** trends, favorite show days, and even **song debuts you’ve witnessed**
* Bonus: Graphs, charts, and bragging rights for those of us who remember our show counts better than birthdays

# ✈️ Vacation Mode

Ever book a trip and realize Goose played there the night *before* you arrived?  
This fixes that. Enter your travel dates + destination and it shows concerts happening during your stay — not just the ones from artists you follow, but extra ones based on your musical taste (the more artists you follow the better predictions). Perfect for finding bonus shows on business trips or “accidentally” planning vacations around tour dates.

# 🎵 Setlist Integration

* Pulls full history
* See what each artist *usually* plays
* View all past setlists for Goose, Phish, etc.
* (Yes, you can sort by number of Hot Teas.)

# 📱 Bonus Stuff

* **Submit shows manually** if something’s missing
* **Local tips** from users — venue hacks, lot vibes, best bathrooms
* **PWA support** — works offline, installable on iPhone/Android [www.prinly.com/install](http://www.prinly.com/install)
* **Print-friendly city guides** for the analog heads

1og0ysj,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1og0ysj/i_feel_jealous_and_unloved/,I feel jealous and unloved,"I (16M) had what I like to believe was a relationship with potential in 10th grade. Hiwever she broke up with me over text. I felt neglected in the relationship sometimes. It was my second relationship. A month later I started dating one of my friends. I liked her, she liked me. But then suddenly 3 months in, she wanted a break. I agreed. She did later say she would like to stay in a relationship with me. But then she ended up breaking up with me just a month later. 
Now, I have a friend who's kinda my best friend but not really. He has been in a relationship for 2 years this month. Now, I know his girlfriend loves him, he loves her. Its great. I'm happy for him. But I am also jealous. Its his first relationship. He is arrogant, ignorant, does not value other people's time, scrolls reels all day. He's very impatient and gets mad if he doesn't get what he wants. His parents have money which is spent on him endlessly. I mean PS5 for bday, iphone every couple years, expensive dining frequently. Now I come from an upper middle class house. Decent car, Decent apartment (I live in India so yes, that can be considered upper middle class. Ik in some countries thats not even middle class). Comfortable, but me nor my dad like to splurge. My mom passed away after battling cancer for 19 months. Me and my family had to witness her condition get worse every single day till the end. I didn’t cry when I got the news. Its been 4 years. I still feel that raw pain and guilt of the words I didn’t say to her. I miss her every waking moment. Idh anyone who'll hold me and tell me I deserve to be loved. My friends, they all are good people. But nobody understands me. Even my closest friend group (4 prople including me and my previously mentioned friend.) I have been nothing but kind and patient towards all my friends and family. I listen to them when they need to be heard, I give them advice when asked, I hug them when they need it. But it seems nobody will give me a hug when I need it. When I talk about my feelings (which is very rare), my previously mentioned friend makes it about himself. He talks about how everything is going wrong with his life. I even lost a really friend who was like a sister to me 2 years ago (atleast she went peacefully in her sleep). None of my friends understand my pain. I watch them cry (literally tears streaming down their face) when their favorite team doesn't get the trophy. Or when they argue with their friend. The other 2 friends are genuinely amazing people. I can see it. But they simply don't understand me.
Coming back to the bit about my privileged attention seeking friend. He's 3 months younger than me. He's taller and has that baby face that everyone loves. Its annoying to watch. He's slightly materialistic, very arrogant and egotistical and somehow nobody sees it. Even the two other friends prefer his company over mine. They will never admit it but I see it. He hasn't lost a single close person. Doesn't know how it feels to have your heart broken over and over again. He doesn't know how it feels to watch your  own mother decay in a hospital bed and know she doesn't have more than a few days left. He doesn't know how it feels to wake up at 5 am to a call telling you your closest friend is dead. Yet he believes that he has been through a lot of pain. He talks only about himself. And yet, I don't have it in me to hate him. I just want to be loved. I want to be seen. Truly seen. I want someone to see through the armour I have fashioned out of my own pain. I want someone to hold me as I cry. I want someone to tell me that my feelings, of hurt and pain are valid. But I have found no such person in years. My dad loves me. No doubt. But he gets angry at every small mistake I make. One minute he will thank me for making us coffee and tell me he loves me (I know he does) but the next, he will get mad because I forget to take the clothes out of the machine. I am in the science stream in 11th grade. I have Physics, chemistry and maths. I spilled some detergent the other day. He told me I don't deserve to study chemistry and I am not worthy. But he does also spoil me every once in a while. Like buying me new clothes atleast once every year. Good branded clothes too. Nothing too expensive. But good quality. Atleast he cares. But every day I make some small mistake and every day i get lectured over responsibility and logic or screamed at for doing something wrong. The thing is I don't want those branded clothes. The most basic ones will do. I don't even need to go out for dinner every once in a while. I don't need to be spoiled. I just need someone to love me selflessly. The same way I love everyone. It seems none of my friends love me like I love them. Is it too much to ask for? To hear someone tell me they love me? To hear someone say they're proud of the fact that I'm still hopeful and optimistic after everything?",1,1761422074.0,teenagers,1,1.0,False

If you’re like me and have come into this place, sitting and watching people like you do at your local coffee shop. Sometimes someone walks in who is interesting and you may chat for a bit but then both go out separate ways, moving on with life. 

Well here I am again, sitting on the proverbial couch, sipping my coffee and observing. If you’d care to chat you’d find I’m a pretty normal guy, enjoying life, busy with work- most of the time it seems like I’m babysitting adults. You’d find I enjoy running, cooking, hanging out with my friends, playing games and learning new things. 

I can’t stand when people spell my name wrong when it’s in an email signature or interrupt me. 

I’m also pretty sure anyone in the north would survive a zombie apocalypse because during the winter I think they’d freeze. Kind of like flies. That can’t do much. I don’t know, that’s a recent pondering of mine. 

All that to say, would love to get to know you, chat and learn what you’re up to! Send me a message and tell me how you take your coffee!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Estrela da Amadora vs. Rio Ave FC: A Clash of Cupped Hopes and Half-Baked Comebacks**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a Liga Portugal Betclic showdown that’s tighter than a goalkeeper’s grip on a last-minute penalty. Estrela da Amadora, currently 15th in the league and still reeling from a 2-0 drubbing by Gil Vicente, hosts Rio Ave (12th), who are plotting a revenge tour after their own Taça de Portugal heartbreak. Let’s unpack this with the precision of a spreadsheet and the wit of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffees.

**Odds Breakdown: A Statistical Tango**  
The bookmakers are playing the “it’s too close to call” card, but let’s decode the numbers. The average implied probability for **Estrela da Amadora** hovers around **40%** (thanks to decimal odds of \~2.5), while **Rio Ave** checks in at **37%** (odds \~2.7). The draw? A tidy 33%, because nothing says “thrilling football” like a stalemate. Historically, Rio Ave holds a 16-7 edge in their 32 meetings, but Estrela’s coach João Nuno is screaming, “We’re worth more than this!”—a line that sounds less like a pep talk and more like a used-car salesman’s defense.

**News Digest: Injuries, Suspensions, and the Ghost of Cup Upsets**  
Estrela’s woes? Their Taça de Portugal elimination at the hands of Alpendorada (a Série B side) still haunts them like a bad hair day. João Nuno, hired September 28, is yet to taste victory, and his players might be channeling *The Hangover*’s Wolf Pack—disheveled and searching for a hotel room.

Rio Ave? They’ve got a plot twist: Clayton Silva returns from suspension, fresh off a hat trick against CD Tondela. If Silva’s form translates to this match, he’ll be the diffe

Anyway, essentially, I actually had a really nice night yesterday. I was with my newly adopted older Non-Binary sibling (lets call them Bee as i don't want to use anyone's real names) and my Non-Binary partner (lets call them Angel). I've known both of them since my first year of college, and when my family met Bee, they had some really bad issues going on, so we decided to adopt Bee. Essentially, we had made plans to hangout pretty much all day until 7:00 pm, in which we would go to Karoke, so we did. We went to a tea and coffee shop, walked in a park, we even played tag. Then we went to Karoke, and that's when everything started to go down hill. Before i continue, here's some contextI should've shared before: i was diagnosed last year in April with my schizophrenia, and it's been kind of a hard journey of self-acceptance. My schizophrenia is a mix of mostly auditory hallucinations, as well as highly negative third person thoughts that aren't my own that I label ""the voices."" I am medicated, and i switched to a higher dose of my current medication recently. I also have episodes, in which i lose control of my thoughts and mind and I'm overwhelmed with these voices and often hallucinations. I shake, i cry, whimper, and often can only speak a few words during these episodes. My family, Angel, and Angel's family are all aware that I'm schizophrenic. Now, back to the story; We were at Karoke and i started to have these negative thoughts. I was trying to use anti negative thought techniques that my therapist showed me, but they slowly just stopped working. Eventually, Angel and Bee started to notice and ask questions, to which i said i was fine for now. I wanted to try and just be ""stronger than the voices"" for once, so i just sort of shoved them down and tried to have a good time. Eventually, I started to crack and i felt tears trying to come out of my eyes, so i used the restroom. After that, i was completely fine, so i was like ""hey, i actually managed to stave off an episode, my therapist is going to be really proud of me!"" At least, that's what i thought. Fast forward an hour later, and it suddenly hits me without warning. I rushed out of the restaurant/bar and sat outside in the mall area, as it's inside a mall. My episode started. Bee came out first, but I couldn't really speak that much, so i just kept saying ""I'm sorry"" for a bit until i started saying Angel's name. Angel and their mom came out and Angel immediately helped console me with Bee and i started to calm down after about 5 minutes. Eventually we decided it was best for me to head home for the night as staying in the overstimulating environment would probably only make things worse, so me and Bee went home. I didn't want to leave, but most of all i didn't want to have an episode in the first place, but it always happens anyway. I hate the way i am and why I'm like this. It feels like i can never be truly happy for once, because everytime i get to be happy, i end up having an episode. I feel fucking insane sometimes and i then the voices constantly tell me things like ""Angel saw how weak you were, now they're going to leave you"" or ""Bee saw how pathetic you looked"" and shit like that. I feel so fucked up and i just want to know if it ever gets better",1,1761421587.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

I wanna get some objective perspective cause I’m not sure if I’m irrational or not. Sorry for my English, it’s not my first language.

So I don’t like my brothers girlfriend. 

For some context, we come from a very close family that cherishes familial bonds. We spend time together as a family, growing up my grandpa was always close to his siblings and he passed that down all the way to our generation. 

I grew up close to all my siblings, later on we all have found partners that are now part of family. Some married, some not but we still remain close. 

My brother, however, has taken a distance from the family. Not just family, but also all of his friends. The only person he spends time with is his now girlfriend (they’ve been together for a couple of years). Over that time period, I haven’t hung out with him one on one or with the family (without her being present) for years. Whenever I make an effort to see him, go grab some food or coffee, spend some time together in any capacity he promises me, we agree on the date and time and then all of a sudden he has other plans and has to go see her. Mind you, they see eachother every single day. We have managed to hang out maybe twice with the other siblings, but she would call him multiple times and text him during the entire get together. Then after an hour or so of being on his phone texting and answering her calls, he’ll make up a lame excuse and leave. 

All of this is very unlike him, he is very social and had many friends. He even cut off his best friend after he started seeing his girlfriend. He doesn’t hang out with family or friends. My mom is very kind and would never tell him anything, my father also doesn’t wanna talk to him about that, but they feel the same way that I do. 

My mom and dad aren’t that well off, but she will come over and eat the food out of the fridge that my mom bought to make lunch for the family the next day. She doesn’t contribute financially since she doesn’t live with them, but spends most days with him in the house until late at night. My other siblings all have partners, so do I, but we see eachother regularly with and without our partners even though some of us work very different hours. We all find it weird. Like I said, we all come from a close and loving family, there were never any family feuds, or any brothers or sisters or cousins not talking to eachother whatsoever. We all do believe that she is very controlling and possessive, but have no proof. I just think it’s odd that we haven’t had problems with any of the other significant others. 

So please, tell me, am I the A-hole? Is it even my business and should I care? I have no idea how to feel or what to think. 

Sorry for the long post. Just to add, I haven’t posted our real age for privacy reasons but we are all in our 20s.

Maybe you know the feeling too? Tired but can’t quite sit still. Lonely but still full of love to give. Hopeful, even after all the ways life has bruised you.

I’m 26, based in Italy, and just quietly hoping this message finds someone who wants something real, not just milestones or distractions, but connection. Someone whose soul feels like a safe place to rest.

Someone who knows that empathy is a muscle  one we grow by being present, listening deeply, and not turning away when things get hard.

About me:

- 6ft, slim build, dark eyes & darker humor (when sleep-deprived)

- Emotionally literate, sometimes overly so. I feel a lot. But I also care a lot.

- Deep thinker. Coffee lover on slow mornings. Volunteering makes me feel less helpless.

- I crave intimacy in the little things like shared playlists, lazy dinners, voice notes that go “so I was just thinking...”

Currently working and studying. Life is chaotic, but there’s beauty in the mess they say.


About you (maybe):

You believe love isn’t found in grand gestures but in consistency. Maybe you cry at movies and care about more than just your own world. You like vulnerable conversations, even the ones with no neat endings. You are thoughtful, curious, and want to grow with someone, not just date them.

Bonus if:

- You find bookstores romantic

- You speak your mind, but always with heart

- You hate bigots and refuse to normalize cruelty

- You love those quiet, late-night “what even is happiness?” kind of talks


What I want:

Not perfection. Just someone sincere. A person I can be soft with who’ll meet me in the middle of all this trying. Maybe we find comfort in each other’s chaos. Maybe we just keep each other company in this strange, beautiful journey of figuring life out.

If any of this resonates, I'd like to get to know you. Tell me who you are when no one’s watching. Share your favorite lyric, your latest overthought idea, or just say hi :)",1,1761421506.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False

I had considered taking Mixsel on a walk around the camp today when I woke up. One look outside quickly changed those plans though. No way in hell was I going walking in the snow. I HATED the cold. It wasn’t something you got used to living your whole life in the climatic equivalent of an oven.

I grabbed the small ice pack I had stored in the freezer last night, wincing slightly as I held it up to the massive, bruised, section of my chest that marked my damaged ribs. The fact that Jammy’s first instinct when he found me in the bathroom had been to headbutt the shit out of me was almost funny. Almost.

I made my way over to the cabinet, grabbing out a pack of salted almonds and the small container of instant coffee I’d been given. Stuff tasted like sewage water but it was better than nothing. Frank had said he’d see about getting a basic coffee machine for me on the next food shipment. Speaking of, that would hopefully be soon. The pantry and fridge were starting to look a little baren. I quickly got a small kettle of water boiling, pouring it into a coffee mug and mixing in the instant coffee before turning to leave.

I walked back into the dining room, finding that Jammek had vanished, leaving Islatta sitting at the table, preening her feathers.

“Oh?” She clucked in concern as she saw me walk back in holding the ice pack to my chest, “Did you have an accident?”

“Oh yeah.” I answered, a bit more confident in my lie since I’d been forced to come up with it, “Just made a stupid decision and ended up falling into the tub.”

“Well I do hope it isn’t anything too serious?”

“Nah.” I assured her with a dismissive wave, “Just some fractured ribs and bruising.”

“Fractured ribs?” She gasped, “Arthur that must have been quite the fall!” I tried to resist the urge to chuckle at that, just nodding my head. I took a seat at the table, opening the small pack of almonds before taking a sip of my coffee. I blanched a little at the taste. I would never get used to this instant trash. I sat the mug down, popping a couple of almonds into my mouth before turning to the Krokotl with a curious grin.

“So how is Jammek’s novel?” I asked, keeping my voice down in case the sheepish Venlil was near enough to hear.

“Oh, quite good.” She chirped, her feathers fluffing up in an indecipherable gesture, “Our Skalgan friend certainly has quite the imagination.”

“Really?” I pressed, grinning mischievously, “The way he was talking about the modern romances he’d been reading I assumed Mon Frère was something of a prude."" This statement got Islatta cawing with laughter, swishing her tail feathers back and forth.

“Oh, he’s certainly no prude!” She answered, wiping a tear out of her eye with one wing, “Some of those scenes he put in there are downright feather ruffling! Like I said he can be VERY imaginative.”

“Well dang.” I huffed amusedly, “Now I want to read it even more!”

“I’m sure he’ll let you eventually.” She assured me, turning her head to look back over her shoulder, as if to make sure the Venlil wasn’t standing behind her, “I do believe you’ll find it quite… informative.” She added, breaking out into another melodic round of laughter.

I cocked an eyebrow at that, not sure what she meant. Was she teasing him?

“Aww go easy on the guy.” I laughed, “He’s definitely the artsy type. I know that. I’m sure he’s got quite the imagination. I wish I could be like that, you know? Be able to think up a whole story from scratch and have the drive to write it all out. I totally get where he’s coming from with the perfectionist stuff though. My ex was like that. She was a painter. Absolutely would NOT let me see any of her stuff before it was finished.” The Krokotl leaned across the table now, turning her head to and fro as if trying to get a good look at me.

“Really?” She pressed with an amused clack of her beak, “So you have a thing for artistic types?”

I paused, thinking it over. I mean… I hadn’t actually been **physically** attracted to Moira but I did suppose that one of the things that made me willing to try with her had been her artistic talent? I had always loved it when she went off on a tangent, trying to describe the difference between two different painting techniques or discussing the merit of certain types of lighting. There was just something about that kind of passion that always excited me. It was something I always felt like I was lacking. I wanted to be passionate about something like she had been.

“I suppose so.” I answered with a shrug. She puffed her feathers up at that answer and I tried to determine if she was offended by my answer or not. Krokotl body language was one I still hadn’t figured out. I quickly threw back the rest of my almonds, chasing them with the last bit of my coffee. “Well if you’ll excuse me ma’am,” I said, rising from the table to take my coffee mug to the sink, “Since I can’t go out today, I think I’m going to start work on a little project I’ve been putting off.”

“Certainly Arthur.” She responded, looking like she was almost bouncing in her chair, “I think I’ll just go chat with Izra for a bit.” The avian hopped down from her seat and headed off towards the living room.

I made my own way towards the kitchen, putting my mug in the sink and tossing the empty almond package. I walked back out, heading through the living room towards my room and the box that had been sitting in there, untouched for the last few days. As I passed, I could see Imel and Mixsel on the floor, setting up some sort of obstacle course with the blocks while Izra and Islatta sat on the couch watching. The two adults turned to silently look at me as I passed. I gave the pair an awkward wave before heading into the hallway that led to my room.

Inside I quickly found what I was looking for. A large box I had gotten from the concierge and sat in the corner. I left it alone for a moment, moving over to my small desk. Reaching underneath I pulled out another, smaller box. The soldering kit I had gotten from Frank a few days back and not bothered to touch yet. I pulled the basic soldering iron and heatgun out and sat them up on the desk. I had to smile as I looked down into the bottom of the box and realized he’d gone above and beyond what I had asked, including a basic set of capacitors, fuses and various other SMD components. There was even a small desk lamp included, along with a set of screwdrivers! I’d have to thank that guy somehow. I hadn’t even thought to ask for half of these tools.

With my tools in place, I marched over to the neglected box in the corner, reaching in and pulling out the sizeable radio I’d been given to work on. As I put it on the desk and could get a good look at it at last, I had to shake my head. Antique my ass! The painted, black metal and simple, cubic shape were something I would certainly recognize from my time I immediately got the feeling this thing was designed to look older than it actually was! The presence of what appeared to be the same kind of display that was in use on the holopads was a dead giveaway!

With an amused chuckle I grabbed the power cord on the radio and plugged it into the wall. Rule number one when working on electronics: Never assume there is actually a problem until you see it for yourself. I found a small power button on the front of the machine and gave it a press. The holographic display flickered and several lights on the front dimly began to glow before everything simply shut off again. Ok. So there was an actual issue. Good. I needed a distraction. I quickly unplugged the device.

Taking up one of the screwdrivers, I got to work slowly disassembling the device. I’d always found this sort of thing relaxing. It was something I could focus my brain on and ignore everything else going on around me. That was one reason I’d thrown myself so much into my work there before… before I got abducted. It was one of the few things I could do that seemed to shut out that voice that was always eating away right at the edge of my consciousness.

The lid came off easily enough, revealing the series of circuit boards inside. I gave the whole apparatus a look over. Despite however many decades had passed between my time on Earth and whenever this thing had been built, it seemed like the basics of electronics had stayed much the same. Diodes, capacitors, resistors… it was all there and still quite recognizable. I made a silent note to investigate what had changed during the last century. Despite how much the components looked the same, I knew deep down that there were probably a ton of differences in materials used and any number of other categories.

I looked over the board, silently wishing that Frank or myself had thought to get a multimeter as well. Unless there was something obviously wrong I would probably never… oh. Well luck was on my side. I quickly spotted a pair of blown capacitors near the front of the machine. With a satisfied smile I begun tearing the device down further, removing screws and boards until I could reach the problem.

I wasn’t sure how much time was passing. When I got into the zone and just focused on my work it always felt like mere minutes but could easily be hours. I enjoyed working with machines. Machines were simple. If there was a problem, no matter how obscure it may seem, there was always a fix. If you tried hard enough and dug deep enough you would eventually find it. Then it was just a simple matter of taking those broken, unworking parts out and replacing them with new parts. If only people were that easy to fix.

If there was some way I could just take out the broken parts of myself and replace them with new, working parts? I suppose that was the whole point of seeing Bilon tomorrow, wasn’t it? The doctor had sent a message to my holopad overnight, letting me know he could see me tomorrow afternoon. Still, I didn’t hold out much hope for our little meeting, but Jammek had just about threatened to drag me into the doctor’s office if I didn’t agree to it myself.

I’d tried therapy before, back in my time. That hadn’t accomplished much. I had only been able to afford a few sessions before my insurance simply deemed it “unnecessary” and refused to cover it. Even then, the only thing those therapy sessions had resulted in was the doctor prescribing me a bunch of pills that made me feel like some kind of zombie. Insurance had been more than happy to keep me on those. But I hadn’t been able to do it. At least when I was off the pills, I could occasionally feel happy in between the deep trenches of my own despair. When I was on the pills? I felt nothing. It was like going through life on autopilot. God I hoped that wasn’t the solution Bilon was going to offer too.

At last, I managed to get the board out of old radio and set it up on the desk. The actual replacement procedure lasted only a couple of minutes before I had a pair of fresh, new capacitors in place. I was about to start reassembling the device when I heard a knock at the door to my room.

“What are you doing Arthur?”

I turned about to find Jammek standing at the entrance, cocking his whole head to the side and watching me curiously.

“Hey Jammy!” I greeted, giving my wooly friend a smile, “Finally getting to work fixing this old radio Frank gave me. What are you doing?”

“I just wanted to check up on you.” The Venlil replied, walking cautiously towards me and peering over my shoulder as I once more started assembling the radio, “I wanted to see if you needed another ice pack or anything?”

“I’m fine Jammy.” I assured him, “I just put some ice on it earlier. Heck it’s starting to feel better already!” As if to test my statement the Venlil brought his tail around my side and pushed it into the bruised area of my chest. The touch was enough to make me wheeze out in pain.

“Fine huh?” He sighed, flicking his ears disapprovingly.

“I’m not made of glass Jammy.” I replied, trying to give him a smile despite the sharp pain in my chest, “I can’t just spend my whole day lying down with a pack of ice on my chest.” There was a moment of silence as I continued my work, Jammek simply watching.

“This all looks so futuristic.” He remarked at last, eyeing the various components on display, “I never could have imagined something like this in my writing.” I gave him a curious look at that. I knew he wrote sci-fi but I had never really got a bead on how advanced the ancient Skalgans were. Did he not recognize what he was looking at?

“It’s not that advanced.” I insisted, “Electronics haven’t changed all that much from when I was around. Did… did the Venlil not have anything like this during your time?” Jammek shook his tail in the negative.

“No way!” He answered, “I think the smallest electronics I knew of back in my time were the size of this whole room! Stuff like this, and especially stuff like those holopads, were completely unthinkable!”

“I thought you said you wrote stories about… like… space travel though?” I said, shocked that it sounded like the Skalgan’s tech was something akin to computers in the 1960s.

“I did but… the ships I imagined are nothing like what I’ve seen so far.” He admitted, “The ships around now work on concepts that nobody had even thought of in my time. I always imagined people traveling through space in rockets powered with fossil fuels.”

“Oh wow.” I snickered, trying to keep my laughter to a minimum lest my ribs act up again, “You really ARE old man Jammy!” I immediately regretted the comment as I felt Jammek push his tail back into my side, making me groan with pain.

“I’m 28 cycles old brahk it!” Jammek hissed, “I’m fairly certain I’m younger than you!”

“Owwww…” I whined, holding my side with one hand as I put in the last screw to the radio, “I didn’t know you were that young.” The Venlil huffed but turned to look at me with one eye.

“H… how old are you anyways?” He questioned.

“I’m 36.” I answered simply, feeling a bit of a blush forming on my face.

“Ha!” Jammek snorted with laughter, “So you’re the actual old man here!” I shook my head. Yeah, I suppose I had that coming.

“Fine! Fine!” I laughed back, reaching around and plugging the radio back in before pressing the power button. To my delight the holoscreen on the front lit up and a menu appeared.

“You did it!” Jammek exclaimed, looking on in wonder at the radio.

“Looks that way.” I answered, looking over the shimmering icons floating above the radio’s surface. “Can’t believe Frank called this thing an antique! It’s got network connections and music apps built in. This would have blown people’s minds back in my day if only because of this holographic screen!”

I felt Jammek lay his head down on my shoulder, eyeing the various music apps available on display.

“Maybe we’re both grandpas then.” He added in, wrapping his tail around my shoulder. I could feel that flush of red on my face spreading, “Cause people in my time would have thought this was witchcraft.” I couldn’t help but snicker a bit at that.

“Oh… sorry.” Came Izra’s voice from the doorway, “I’m not intruding on something am I?”

I wasn’t sure who jumped harder at that, me or Jammek. As one we wheeled about to face the doorway, finding Izra standing there, her gaze turned away awkwardly.

“No!” I insisted quickly, feeling a bit foolish for having reacted like that, “I was just working on this old radio.”

“Ah.” The Arxur replied bluntly, finally turning to face us, “Well there’s someone here who would like to talk with you Jammek.” My space sheep pal and I exchanged a look. I think both of us knew there was probably only one person at the camp who would come to pay him a visit unexpectedly.

“She’s sitting in the dining room.” Izra continued, “I’m going to go with Onio to grab Veryn. The girl needs some things from the concierge but is too nervous to go alone.”

Jammek seemed to hesitate as Izra turned and left, looking back at me and shuffling his paws on the ground.

“Want me to go with you pal?” I asked, looking up at him.

“Would you?” Jammek asked with an anxious sigh.

“Sure thing Mon Ami.” I answered, pulling myself up out of the seat and walking with him out of the room. As we made our way down the hallway, I felt something wrap around my wrist, looking down to find that the Venlil had wrapped his tail there, probably as some way to calm his nerves. “Just try and give her a chance Jammy.” The Venlil didn’t answer but gave me a flick of his ears I took to be a nod.

Islatta and the kids had seemingly left as well, giving me a slight twinge of dread. The Krokotl seemed a responsible enough woman but… well… after what happened at the cookout the idea of not knowing exactly where my little fluffball was filled me with anxiety. I pushed the thought aside for a moment and kept moving towards the dining room.

Sure enough, as we walked into the dining room we found Nalva sitting on the far side of the table near the kitchen entrance. The ball of gray wool looked extremely nervous, shuffling in her chair and gripping onto her own tail. I could already assume it was the shock of having Izra answer the door.

“Hello Nalva.” I greeted, taking a seat and watching as Jammy sat down beside me, leaving the whole table between us and the gray ball of nerves on the far side. I could feel his tail grip a little tighter around my wrist as he gave her a greeting flick of his ears.

“Hello.” The smaller Venlil replied after a moment, appearing to calm down a bit when she realized Izra had gone. She paused a moment there, looking behind us into the living area as if to confirm the massive space croc wasn’t just waiting around the corner and waiting to leap out at her.

“So why the visit?” Jammek interrupted, sounding like she was already testing his patience.

“I think we got off on the wrong paw last time.” Nalva sighed, calming down a bit more at last, “I just wanted to come and try and smooth any ruffled wool. I had a talk with Arthur the other day and I think I have a better idea what I did that upset you.” She paused for a moment, looking over to me and giving me a flick of her tail.

“About that.” Jammek whined, looking at me as well now before turning back to her, “I think I may have overreacted. I apologize. I know you can’t help what you look like or what those Federation people did to you. It was just… overwhelming.”

“Exactly.” Nalva agreed, lowering her head, “I understand. I apologize for all that… predator talk. I think I must have given you the impression that I don’t like humans. Well that’s far from the truth! I know I still have a lot of the old Federation brainwashing I need to work through, but the truth is if I didn’t trust or like the humans I would never have volunteered to fly all the way to their homeworld for this.”

“That’s certainly fair.” I piped up, giving Jammek’s tail a comforting squeeze, “By the way why did you volunteer to come here? Just to meet a Skalgan Venlil?”

“That’s the other thing I wanted to bring up…” She answered, folding in on herself a little bit, “The thing is that the findings from the archives are going to be made public in just a few days and Governor Tarva is planning to run a large part of her reelection campaign on those findings.”

“What do you mean?” Jammek insisted, his curiosity suddenly piqued, “I wasn’t aware that the public didn’t know about the archives yet? I swear I’ve heard it mentioned on the news a few times.”

“The public knows that we FOUND the archives.” Nalva explained, “But they don’t know WHAT we found yet. When the findings are finally released the Governor plans to make reversing the Federation’s changes to our species and changing the planet’s name back to Skalga part of her campaign.” That certainly got Jammek’s attention.

“Really?” He gasped excitedly, his ears perking up, “That’s wonderful!” He paused a moment before adding, “What does that have to do with me though?”

“Yes… well,” Nalva continued, squirming a bit in her seat, “The whole reason I came here was on the Governor’s request. If we want to undo what’s been done to the Venlil we’re going to need examples of unaltered Venlil. Genetic information. Comparative physiology examinations. That sort of thing. Tarva wanted me to convince some of the Skalgan’s here at the camp to come back to V… Skalga to help our doctors in that effort.”

Jammek noticeably cringed at that suggestion, his tail giving my wrist a tight squeeze.

“I… I don’t want to live on Skalga anymore.” He admitted, those ears that had perked up just a moment ago at her idea now lowering down, “I don’t recognize my own planet any more. I don’t recognize my own species. You all cower at the sight of your own shadow.”

“But we don’t want to be like that.” Nalva insisted, “We want to go back to how we were supposed to be. Please? The only other Skalgan I’ve managed to convince here is that Brim fellow and… well a sample size of one isn’t very useful.”

“What if he didn’t have to go back permanently?” I suggested, “What if he agreed to come to Skalga for a bit to participate in your doctor’s study and then you could let him come back to Earth?”

“That would work fine!” Nalva agreed excitedly, “Governor Tarva would never turn down any option to get our people back to how they’re supposed to be!” Jammek looked over at me, studying me with those blue eyes before turning back to Nalva.

“I… I could agree to that.” He said at last. I reached over and gave my friend a pat on the shoulder with the hand he wasn’t currently constricting.

“Heck yeah Jammy!” I cheered him on, “Maybe you could even go visit your hometown? See what it looks like now?” The Venlil gave his ears an agreeing fick.

“Only if you come with me.” He insisted, turning towards me once more, “You’re not shipping me off to a planet full of crazy people and just abandoning me.”

“Well,” I replied slowly, thinking the offer over, “I’d love to go with you and see a whole alien planet but… what about Mixsel?”

“We can arrange for all three of you!” Nalva exclaimed, practically jumping out of her seat, “Like I said, Governor Talva is very intent on this! Whatever you need to make this happen, she will arrange for!”

“Then I guess that settles it.” I laughed, “Looks like we’ll get us a little vacation, eh?”

“Sure.” Jammek answered, although I could tell he was much less enthusiastic about it than either Nalva or myself.

“I’m glad we could agree on this.” Nalva sighed, leaning back into her chair, “That only leaves me a couple of more Skalgans to go beg.”

“None of them intent on going back?” Jammek asked, looking a bit more sympathetic now.

“None except Brim.” She sighed, “And he just wants to go back because he thinks living around a bunch of people without wool is going to stain his immortal soul or some speh.”

“Yeah, that one is a real stick in the mud.” I groaned, shaking my head. The two Venlil looked at me, the phrase clearly flying over their wooly heads.

“Anyways,” Nalva finished, hopping out of her seat and vanishing as she reached down onto the ground beside her, “I brought a peace offering as well.” She came back up into view holding a small, rectangular package that reminded me of a DVD case.

“What’s that?” Jammek asked as she offered the slim package to him.

“It’s a movie.” She explained, “A recent one filmed on… Skalga.” I had to smirk at her noticeable pause. She was clearly trying very hard to break the habit of calling it Venlil Prime.

“What is this?” Jammek asked, his eyes glued to the cover of the case. I could already tell, by the way his ears were leaning back, that he was getting upset again.

“Wait!” Nalva gasped, her tail hiking up high behind her, “I know what you’re thinking! Arthur already told me you didn’t like those exterminator flicks! This one is actually a comedy!”

I leaned over, peeking at the cover of the movie she had given him. I could see a human and a Venlil leaning against each other, back-to-back, each of them dressed in what looked like some sort of aluminum suite and holding a flamethrower. The title stood out above their heads, written in letters resembling flames, “Exterminated”.

“It’s a story about a human and his Venlil pal joining the exterminators!” She tried to explain, “The Chief Exterminator keeps trying to get them kicked out but they mess up all her plans. Please! Just give it a try!”

“Fine.” Jammek answered at last, letting out an exasperated sigh. Nalva wagged her tail a bit at that, clearly pleased by the answer.

“Well, I’ll leave you folks be. I have a few more pleas to offer today.” She announced, making her way towards the front door. As she walked, I couldn’t help but notice how awkward her movements were. She looked so clumsy and awkward compared to the Venlil I’d become used to here around camp. “I’ll be in contact soon with details about plans to get you folk to Skalga!” She yelled, right before closing the front door.

 

**\*\*Transcript time skip requested. Advancing memory by 6 hours\*\***

 

I nearly doubled over in laughter, grabbing painfully at my side as my ribs screamed in protest. This movie was probably the best piece of alien cinema I had seen yet!

“I mean they DID technically burn down the target!” Jammek snorted, letting out an unrestrained bleat of laughter.

The two of us had sat together watching Nalva’s little peace offering for the last hour and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. I had been a bit nervous when we started this thing up that I was just going to see the same crap as last time. Except maybe this time they would add a laugh track over the images of human children getting burned alive. Thankfully I had been quite wrong. The Chief Exterminator was portrayed as some old, crotchety and racist asshole. The rest of the Exterminators started off just as racist but seemed to quickly warm up to their new, human coworker and change their ways. It was… hopeful. I think that was the right word. It made me feel like, at least some of the universe outside our little camp was able to see how messed up their way of thinking was. Maybe things could change? Maybe the whole universe could be like our camp?

We sat side by side on the couch, holding an ice pack to one side of my chest while Jammek leaned against the other. Suddenly I felt the Venlil at my side tense up, his ears shooting up and twitching from side to side. I looked down at him, cocking a curious brow at him.

“Something up?” I asked wondering if maybe Izra was finally making her way back to the house.

“You don’t hear that?” He asked, sitting up suddenly, “Speh. Human hearing sucks.” He groaned, turning his head towards the hallway that led off from the living room. I quickly got a bit more serious, setting the ice pack down and standing up as he did.

Without explaining, he began to march towards the hallway, myself in tow. As we got close to the hallway, I could finally hear what he was talking about over the sound of the television. Sobbing.

As one, we quickly turned to Mixsel’s room. We had put her to bed a few hours ago. She had seemed extremely worn out after her day of visiting all her little friends in the camp with Islatta and Imel, so I had assumed she would sleep like a stone after her bath.

Jammek was the first to act, opening the door. In the dark room beyond I could see the tiny Sivkit girl, sitting on her comparatively huge bed, clutching tight to her stuffed Venlil doll and sobbing uncontrollably.

“Mon Chéri!” I gasped, rushing into the room and over to her bed, “What’s wrong?”

“I… I had a bad dweam.” She sniffled, holding back a sob as she looked up at me, “I dweamed the… the dog… the dog was going to eat me!” She finished, breaking off into a wailing sob and burying her face into Frank’s plush shoulder once more. I sat down on the side of her bed, gently running my hand through her fur.

“Shhhh… shhhh…” I comforted her, “That mean old dog is never going to hurt you again munchkin.” I promised. Jammek walked over and sat down on the opposite side of the bed from me, sandwiching her between us.

“Arthur’s right little Humdrum.” The Venlil cooed, “You’re safe now. We won’t let anything hurt you.” The Sivkit girl sniffled, finally holding back her sobs as Jammek and I took our time, gently petting on her.

“W… will you stay?” She whimpered, looking up and turning her gaze between the two of us, “Will you stay till I can go back to sleep?” She asked, sucking back some snot from her sobbing session.

“Of course, Munchkin.” I replied, gently rubbing one of her long ears, “You just lay down and Jammek and I will stay till you go back to sleep.” The girl seemed to calm down at that, laying back down into her bed at last with one last sniffle.

“Don’t worry little pup.” Jammek added in, “You’re ok. We’ll keep you safe.”",11,1761421493.0,NatureofPredators,1,1.0,False

I honestly feel funny about requesting cards for myself but I’m turning 35 in about a month on 11/26/2025 and would love birthday or happy mail! Postcards welcome too. 

I’m located in California. This past year I’ve had to be very career focused and it has been a detriment to my social life so I feel lonely. I also generally struggle with my birthday because it’s near thanksgiving and people forget about it.

Interests include cats, coffee, travel, single view tourist cards, maps, food, wine, cozy vibes, positive mental health, encouragement, affirmations, the color purple, cool stamps, stickers 

I would love to receive 35 or more cards. I believe in numerology type stuff. 

If sending in an envelope, please make it obvious it’s birthday mail so I don’t open it in advance. Please comment below and I will chat you my address! ",3,1761421376.0,RandomActsofCards,4,1.0,False

1og0hj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1og0hj6/solo_trip_report_10201023/,Solo Trip Report 10/20-10/23,"This was my first solo trip. A bit of background- I went to WDW this past spring with a few other individuals after not having been to the parks in many years. Disney is a good time in and of itself, but I didn’t get the magical experience I was hoping for. Without going into details, I knew I needed a “re-do”, I needed to reclaim moments and memories for myself. This trip was pretty emotionally loaded for me and I was worried about how I would feel going back alone. But I’m happy to report that it was amazing and everything I hoped it would be.

**Mon 10/20:**

Flew in early morning and arrived at Riviera around noon. I found this resort to be absolutely beautiful. I know not everyone cares for the subtle theming, but I found the vibes to be a perfect fit. I feel I get enough theming in the parks and this was a relaxing and lovely place to retreat to. I had already had a few snacks/water delivered from Kroger and was able to check into my room right away. Took a little time to get settled, change and freshen up before hitting Epcot.

Skyliner over to Epcot for the afternoon/evening. I met Pooh in the UK pavilion (had to recreate a childhood memory), then strolled World Showcase. Enjoyed a couple treats from Les Halles (finally!), got my pretzel bread pudding from Germany (delish), and rode The Three Caballeros. Had a LL for Guardians; I was terrified to ride this during my previous trip but ended up doing it twice and couldn’t wait to do it again. For me, it’s a representation of overcoming my anxiety and it was just pure bliss this time; I nailed the photo op, got EWTRTW, and came off a little misty eyed. Ugh, so good. From there I did LWTL and Soarin’ (first time on Soarin’), strolled through Journey of Water, did Nemo, Frozen Ever After, then a bit more World Showcase exploration. Ended the night with an iced mint tea from Morocco (chef’s kiss). I was pretty hungry for more substantial food on my way back to Riv, so I grabbed a burger from Bar Riva (personally thought it was a REALLY good burger) and ate on my balcony while watching the Luminous fireworks.

**Tues 10/21:**

Got up early to rope drop HS. A private Skyliner ride when the air is still crisp and the sun is still rising…nothing compares, right? Arrived around 7:45, decided to go for Rise first. What a treat to blast through that que lol. I’m not a huge Star Wars fan but fell in love with that ride in the spring. It hits different early AM! Was off by 8:45 and headed directly to ToT. I have always chickened out with ToT, at one point I vowed I would never do it. I knew I needed to prove to myself that I could. And I freaking DID IT. Do I love that stomach drop feeling? No. Did I still come off smiling? YES. I would do it again. Shout out to the kind fellow next to me who asked if I was ok after the first drop. We basically linked arms the whole ride since there’s not great places to hold to stabilize yourself lol. So fun! I purchased my first pin in the gift shop to commemorate the occasion.

I was still feeling good so I decided to walk right on to RnR. Another one that makes me nervous but I also secretly love. It was a blast as usual. I walked back over to Galaxy’s Edge to get a breakfast Ronto Wrap and just explore a little. I hadn’t seen much of this section previously and the theming is really well done. Saw some Storm Troopers, caught a little of the stage show at Batuu, and had Lieutenant Agnon question me as I sipped my blue milk. Fun little moment for me. I walked through Toy Story land which was a huge blast from the past but opted not to spend much time in that sea of screaming children lol.

Next, I rode Runaway Railway for the first time, super cute. Got a carrot cake cookie from Trolley Car and enjoyed that while people watching on Sunset Blvd. I hopped over to catch the Frozen Sing Along and found this to be such pleasant surprise. The actors are charming and there are enough jokes for the adults in the room. Besides, singing “Let It Go” as a Type A/perfectionist/people pleasing female is therapeutic haha. Thereafter went directly to the Indiana Jones stunt show; an oldie but still a goodie.

I was fading a little by this point so I went back to the resort to take a break. Quick nap, a couple hours in the AC, and then back to Epcot for more strolling. I found that I really enjoy Epcot at night. I shopped, said hey to Beverly (I actually LOVE her), and listened to the M80s at Eat to the Beat for a bit. Hot take: between my experience with F&G in the spring and F&W this fall, I think festival food is overrated. Maybe I just picked subpar options, but in the future I’d rather spend my money on the “classic” offerings at the various pavilions. I had hoped to get a croque glace in France but they were out, so I got a pumpkin macaron sandwich instead and it was satisfying enough. By that time, Luminous was about to start so I stayed to watch. Really lovely show and seeing projections and fireworks over the lake is a nice change from Main Street.

**Wed 10/22:**

Up early again for EE at DAK. Got an almond cold brew from Le Petit Café and it was delicious- perfect fuel to sip on during my bus ride over. I started the day in Pandora and rode Na’vi for the first time (it was fine but I would never wait more than 30min for this). Grabbed a quick bite from Tamu Tamu, did the safari (Tucker is getting so big!), then attended the 10am Festival of the Lion King show. Again- first time experiencing this and it was wonderful. From there I did the walk up wait list at Nomad and was seated outside right away. I was there in the spring as well and I can say with confidence that this is one of my favorite spots on property. Such a vibe. I got the grilled chicken satay, churros, and hibiscus henna (not much of a drinker), and everything was scrumptious. If only I could bottle this place up and bring it home with me.

Feathered Friends in Flight was a nice little reprieve and entertaining.

I rode Dinosaur mostly to say I did it before it’s gone. I have PTSD from this ride as a kid lol; I know it’s a crowd favorite, but man it’s a rough ride. My stomach and back weren’t too happy afterwards, but given that it’s quintessential Disney I’m glad I made time for it.

I was perusing a gift shop before leaving and was approached by a fellow first time solo-er who had seen me sitting alone at Nomad. Not sure he’ll ever see this post, but-- thank you so much for saying something. I was a little tired, emotional, and lonely by this point in my trip and it really made my day to know I wasn’t alone in my experience. I enjoyed our brief chat and I hope you had an amazing time, too!

Back to Riv for more rest. I had a Beak & Barrel res for late afternoon but was able to push it back when I knew I needed another nap! Headed out to MK around 4:45. I was the only passenger on the bus ride over and had a nice conversation with the driver who gave me a lot of tips and recommendations. I will have to take his advice and do a croissant crawl one of these times!

It was so fun to walk down Main Street and enjoy the fall/Halloween décor in person. The park was busy and wait times were fairly long but I was able to get Pirates and Haunted Mansion in with just enough time to scurry over to B&B. B&B was a cool experience, food and drink was solid, CMs were fairly interactive, and thankfully I got a spot at the bar. Had they seated me elsewhere I don’t know that I would have stayed. I think it’s worth going to once but I don’t feel the need to go again.

By the time I exited B&B it was about 8:30 and CMs were already directing guests away from the main hub. I ended up near the bridge to Liberty Square and watched Happily Ever After from there. Decent view of the castle and projections, fireworks were partially hidden by nearby trees but I still really enjoyed it. I’ve seen HEA from a more head on vantage point previously and now I know that you really have to stake your spot with plenty of time. I thought I could squeeze in somewhere last minute but the CMs are understandably very firm with crowd control. Next time I’ll be sure to plan ahead a bit better! Still, I sang along and cried and soaked it all in; it felt really empowering to be there alone, a healing version of myself, very full circle moment.

After HEA ended, I walked onto It’s a Small World for nostalgia purposes-- hadn’t been since I was a child and I likely will never do that one again lol. I was able to make it over to PeopleMover just before 10 to close out the evening. Absolute best way to end the day; probably going to be a tradition to do that one last every time. So relaxing! As I was starting to exit the park, I noticed the crowds were still extremely heavy and folks had essentially not moved from their fireworks viewing location. I wasn’t sure what was going on but lingered for a few minutes and was so pleased to discover the Starlight Parade. Didn’t realize it was scheduled for 10, but I’m so glad I stayed. I stood right on Main Street and it was a beautiful, magical way to end my trip. Got some great professional pics in front of the castle, too. My heart was so full.

**Thurs 10/23:**

Breakfast at Topolino’s! The hype is real here. The food was the best I had all trip: steak and eggs, a side of that sour cream waffle (OMG), and POG juice. The character interactions were lovely, I didn’t feel too awkward dining there alone, and the ambiance is wonderful. And of course, a gorgeous view of all of Disney World from the rooftop. Highly recommend.

I had some time before my evening flight, so I decided to Uber over to AKL and explore the grounds a bit. Gorgeous lobby and a unique atmosphere for sure. Had to try the zebra domes. Nice to get a different feel from the Riviera and I appreciate that Disney resorts offer such a variety of environments. I hope to explore other resorts in the future.

I spent a couple hours at Disney Springs; tried the mac n cheese bites from The Basket at Wine Bar George and got my Gideon’s cookies to take home (the real reason for the trek over there!). I went back to Riv for a couple hours and just relaxed with a coffee in their lobby until it was time to head to the airport. I was so incredibly sad to leave but I knew that was confirmation that I had had such a beautiful time.

I realize this report is long winded, so if you’ve made it this far, thank you so much for reading! A few takeaways:

\*Riviera already feels like home. I feel spoiled now and it will be tough to go back to value or moderate resorts after this lol. The tower studio was perfect for my needs.

\*I love the flow of early morning starts with a mid-day rest and then returning to the parks for a late evening. I needed a few hours to get out of the sun, hydrate, and put my feet up. Having the flexibility to do that made a huge difference.

\*Get the professional pictures. I paused several times to do this and, though I wish the package wasn’t so expensive, I’m glad I have some great poses as well as ride pics to look back on.

\*Shipping souvenirs home no longer caps at a \~$40 fee. It was about $75 for me. I was ok splurging this time (didn’t have much of a choice), but will approach it differently in the future.  

\*Epcot and DAK are my faves. I learned that MK no longer appeals to me as much. I’m content to spend an evening there with a few must-do rides, fireworks, and perusing the Emporium.

\*Disney’s got me. I never thought I would say that in my 30s. I don’t know what kind of voodoo they’re doing down there but I get it now. I get the appeal. I’m coming down off of the high and am already considering those bounce back deals.

\*Solo trips are so much fun. I’m so proud of myself for doing it. This won’t be my last, that’s for sure!

Thanks Disney for everything. <3

1og0ekc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStation_X/comments/1og0ekc/the_one_accessory_that_actually_made_my_ps5_setup/,The One Accessory That Actually Made My PS5 Setup Feel Premium: A Proper Controller Dock,"For the longest time, I treated controller docks as unnecessary clutter — one of those “nice to have” accessories that looks good in a promo image but doesn’t really change anything. I figured plugging my controller in with a USB-C cable was fine. But after trying a few docks over the years — from cheap plastic stands to Sony’s official DualSense charging station — I’ve completely changed my mind. A good dock doesn’t just charge your controllers; it makes your entire setup feel smoother, tidier, and more reliable.

The first thing I noticed after switching to a dock was how much less I had to think about charging. With cables, I’d always forget to plug the controller in after a long session. Then, the next night, I’d sit down to play and find it flashing low battery. It became a routine frustration. A dock fixes that almost effortlessly — I just drop the controller in place and it’s ready to go next time. No searching for cables, no fighting with USB ports, no half-charged surprises.

The official Sony dock is still the gold standard for me. It’s compact, simple, and uses the same charging terminals as the console’s USB ports, so it doesn’t wear out your controller’s connector. You just align the controller and it snaps in with a satisfying click. It charges both controllers evenly, and the LED indicators are subtle — not the bright, eye-searing kind some third-party ones use. I’ve had mine for over two years, and it still works like day one.

That said, I’ve also tried a few third-party versions, and they’re a mixed bag. Some add cool touches, like magnetic charging or vertical stands that hold the console, but they often feel cheap and inconsistent. A lot of them draw power directly from the PS5’s USB ports, which isn’t ideal if you’re running multiple accessories — it can lead to slower charging or unstable connections. The better ones use their own wall adapter, which keeps everything powered properly without stressing the console’s ports.

What surprised me the most wasn’t the convenience, though — it was how much cleaner the setup looked. Without cables dangling everywhere, the PS5 area finally feels organized. There’s something satisfying about seeing both controllers neatly sitting on a dock, fully charged, ready to go. It makes the whole setup feel intentional, like a complete system rather than a jumble of gadgets.

It’s funny because I used to see docks as an unnecessary luxury, but now it’s one of those small quality-of-life upgrades I can’t go without. Every time I see someone juggling cables or leaving their controller plugged in awkwardly across the coffee table, I get flashbacks of how annoying that used to be.

Sometimes, the best accessories aren’t the ones that add new features — they’re the ones that quietly make your daily use smoother. The PS5 dock might not be as exciting as a new headset or SSD, but it’s the one accessory that made my setup finally feel “finished.”",1,1761420706.0,PlayStation_X,1,1.0,False

**""Well... I don't keep track of everyone I kill... I guess around 60...?"" - the Ultimate Guitarist**

Reasoning: While investigating Kokoro’s murder scene, she noticed fallen icicles with carved inscriptions. Using these clues, she deduced the killer before the trial. During the trial, she brings up her deduction during the class trial revealing that the liquid nitrogen was fake evidence to distract the case and that Kokoro had actually frozen to death in the fridge. She also deciphered that the dying message from Kokoro represented each icicle as a girl, with the pierced icicle symbolizing Kokoro. Since the pierced icicle was the largest, she concluded that the culprit was the tallest girl, Emma Magorobi she also refuted all of Emma’s counter arguments to the accusation. During Yuri’s Class Trial, it’s revealed that she went to the infirmary after realising Yuri Kagarin died from an anesthetic substance, because she had smelled it many times before and discovered that a single syringe had disappeared. She deduces that the missing syringe could be used to conveniently calculate the sedation time using the scale on the bottle. She correctly theorizes that Hajime began preparations at night, exploiting a loophole. She realizes that Hajime didn’t pull Yuri up directly, but instead used a hook attached to his life jacket, which was connected to him with a rope, utilizing the bell tower to pull them up. She theorizes that Hajime couldn’t have jumped off the bell tower due to its height, as the kinetic energy would have dislocated their shoulders upon landing though she counteracts this when she figures out it’s hajime. She also concludes that Yuri was nearly unconscious because he accepted help from Hajime. She pieces together the timeline of events: Yuri’s death occurred before the body discovery announcement, giving Hajime extra time to move around while Sora and Yuki were climbing the stairs. She further deduces that Hajime used the hook to descend instead of the stairs, eliminating the possibility that he wouldn’t have had enough time to commit the crime. She infers that he yanked the hook out of Yuri’s right calf while carrying Yoruko to the top, then reinserted it afterward. She concludes that the broken wires were set up as an alibi and that Hajime jumped off the bell tower twice. Finally, she correctly hypothesizes that Hajime used Yuri’s E-Handbook to prompt anyone who witnessed the murder scene to run up the bell tower to catch the culprit. Ultimately, she deduces that Hajime was forced to jump off the bell tower due to outside interference.

Emotional Intelligence: During Kokoro’s Class Trial, she is able to deduce Emma’s entire motive for killing Kokoro, as well as Kokoro’s state and actions, based on Emma’s own reactions and behavioral traits she was also able to see through Emma’s fake acting. During Yuri’s Class Trial, she recognizes Hajime’s guilt of killing Yuri by the tone of his voice.

Short Term Planning: She selected sleeping drugs, a medkit, and blood packs for her murder plan. Drugged Iroha’s coffee to remove her alibi, then lured Setsuka to the pool, electrocuted her, and poured blood on her. When Hibiki found Setsuka seemingly dead, she broke down and entered a trance-like state, completely obedient to Kanade. Exploiting this, she handed Hibiki a knife, and together they stabbed Setsuka, killing her. They then used Setsuka’s handbook to confuse the gate records. Hibiki placed a “Sanitation Time” sign outside while she dismembered Setsuka’s body into eleven pieces, cleaning the scene afterward. She hid the torso and sent the chest across the area using one of the Parade’s robots. To create an alibi, Hibiki disguised herself as Kanade using Setsuka’s severed hand and body parts, messaged Iroha to meet at the Ghost House, and ensured she was seen there. Meanwhile, she used the monorail to dispose of seven body parts via the Ghost House chimney. Once suspicion rose, she collected the hidden pieces, placed them on the altar, and spread blood to stage the Ghost House as the murder scene. When the others arrived, she acted as if she had just entered. Finally, she released Hibiki from her trance—leaving her with no memory of the crime. She had crafted a flawless plan: a fake alibi, two scapegoats, and a setup where even if they voted for Hibiki or herself, the trial’s rules would let her win and she did all of this in a single day.

Adaptability: She adapted her guitar playing to synchronise perfectly with Hibiki’s singing during a party organized by Setuka, with an error margin of only 0.000001 seconds.

Long Term Strategy: She would repeatedly murder Hibiki’s acquaintances to psychologically break her reducing her to the state of an obedient puppet starting with Hibiki’s dog Shiro she took a kitchen knife, butchered Shiro into pieces, and washed him down the drain to dispose of the evidence pushing Hibiki’s best friend Ayumi down a flight of stairs to cause her entire body to be paralysed for the rest of her life giving the middle-school teacher Hibiki had a crush on an extra dose of muscle relaxant, and burying him outside the school to dispose of the evidence killing the recording engineer, makeup coordinator, and manager for Hibiki’s band turning them into sushi to dispose of the evidence and murdering her own parents.

Deception: She fooled everyone into believing she was a kind and caring younger sister with her acting skills, including Kokoro Mitsume, the Ultimate Psychologist, who can see through people with a single glance and tell when someone is lying just by their voice.

Other: Continuously pointed out contradictions during her class trial to psychologically distract everyone. Hibiki described her as a highly skilled dart thrower. Kanade claimed that she was superior to Hibiki in every way, even if Hibiki had given her all, including using her own Ultimate talent. she may have known about Emma’s status as a Void before the class trial, but since discovering the Voids wasn’t her goal, she chose not to mention it. Kanade categorizes people into three groups: herself, Hibiki, and irrelevant people. She would achieve a perfect score if the students were ranked by grades. As the Ultimate Guitarist, she is also highly skilled at playing the guitar. Kanade ranks highest in reasoning power, intelligence, and acting, with all three of these stats ranking with an 'S', and all of her stats are based off of natural ability alone. Kanade's lowest stats are human nature and physical ability but that’s only because she didn’t train. She was previously a Otoshirabe Arts High School Student.

Behind him, my youngest rows through imaginary wreckage, gripping a plastic boat paddle and swinging it wildly around the room. Every few strokes, the paddle thuds against the sofa or my four-year-old, who is playing the part of a frozen body, curled into a tight shivering ball and “bobbing” gently on the floor. He only breaks character after taking a particularly hard paddle blow to the face, but then mutters “ow,” and then keeps floating.

Then, out of the darkness, my six-year-old, lying face down across three couch cushions he’s dragged onto the floor, lifts his head just enough to whisper:

“Come baaaack…”

He blows a toy whistle. Once. Twice. Then again. For three straight hours. Each time he looks up, I can see the imprint of couch leather  stamped across his cheeks: proof of how long he’s been out there, adrift. And then, just when the room finally goes quiet, one of his brothers grabs the remote, hits “play from the beginning,” and the whole thing starts all over again.",172,1761420545.0,daddit,28,0.98,False

I’m a developer, and I’ve been working on this app because I kept running into issues when buying products in bulk to take advantage of deals. I’d often forget the expiration dates of some products 😅 That’s when I decided to build a solution!

Here’s what it does:

📦 **Product registration:** Add items manually or by scanning their barcode. For each product, you can log:

* Name and image
* Purchase date and expiration date
* Category
* Location (kitchen, pantry, shelf A...)
* Notes
* Quantity 

🗂️ **Smart organization:** Sort and filter products by category or location, so you can quickly find what you need and keep track of what’s running low or nearing expiration.

📱 **Barcode scanning:** Add or search for products in a snap by scanning their barcode 

⏰ **Alerts and notifications:** Set reminders for when products are about to expire (you choose how many days in advance) or when they’ve already expired.

If you're interested, comment below or send me a DM.  
Thanks! 🙏

My luck was finally starting to turn around. Nobody had tried to murder me in at least three days, the sky had been clear all the way up into the Smoky Mountains, and I even found $30 in some guy’s wallet. The sun was coming down, and I had some pocket change, so I stopped at a bar in Bryson City.

Compared to the shithole that I came from, this town was a sight to behold. There wasn’t much to it, but that’s what made it so nice. There was just enough civilization to keep the bears away but not enough to take away from the mountain views. The main street was just a row of little brick coffee houses, mom-and-pop shops, and dive bars. It was cold as all hell, but that’s one of the many problems that liquor can fix, and I had money to burn.

I managed to find the dingiest dive bar in town on my first try. Law of Attraction or some shit. The walls were peeling and the floorboards creaked as I walked on them–my kind of place. I was the roughest looking person in the building, but not by much. A gang of weather beaten men sat at the bar, taking up every seat but one, and it didn’t look like they were keen on anyone joining them. They all had matching shirts that said ""Schole and Son Construction"" on the back. Despite their salty looks, I took a seat at the open stool and ordered a shot of Wild Turkey. I threw it back in one gulp and ordered another.

“Looks like you’ve been havin’ a tough time of things,” the man next to me said with a smile. I guess looks could be deceiving. He was even more weathered up close and had a salt-and-pepper beard with a little bit of beer foam in it that dripped down to his neck when he spoke. “Name’s Artie Schole. Where you from?”

“Gus Whitehall. Nowhere in particular,” I said. It felt strange to have a friendly conversation after spending so much time alone on the road. I finished my second glass of whiskey hoping that it would loosen me up a little.

“That your ride over there?” the man pointed out the window to my shot up shitmobile. I nodded.

“Sheesh. You must have some stories to tell,” he continued. “You runnin’ from the law, or somethin’ worse?”

“Worse,” I said. “Much worse.” I decided to switch it up and order a Natty Light. I was going to have to drive later, after all.

I piqued the interest of a couple of Artie’s friends. One of them, a big guy rocking an impressive handlebar moustache, looked down at my arm. I put it down at my side so that he couldn’t see it anymore.

“Like something you see, big boy?” I said. I didn’t appreciate being stared at.

“Yeah, those crazy ass birthmarks or whatever they are,” he said. It honestly didn’t seem like there was any malice behind what he was saying, but it pissed me off anyway.

“You think I was born with this on my arm? Man, you’re dumber than you look with that Hulk Hogan stache of yours,” I said, and took another sip of my beer. I actually thought the stache was pretty nice, to be honest, but I would never tell a man that to his face. His expression changed immediately, and the whole damn construction company had their attention on me now.

“Someone else came around here not too long ago with somethin’ like that on their arm,” Artie said. “Killed a man in broad daylight, took the jacket off his body, and ran off.”

“Yup, sounds like Mickey,” I said. That was not the right response. I probably should’ve assured them that I was not like him, that I wouldn’t end someone’s life out of nowhere, but I was never much good at lying.

“That a friend of yours?” the moustached man asked.

“Actually, I'm on my way to kill him. Didn’t happen to catch where he was going, did you?”

I couldn’t win with these guys. I tell them that I’m going to enact some vigilante justice on the man who just murdered someone in their quaint little town, and they start acting like they want to kick my ass. Give me a fucking break.

“Naw, he didn’t, and I think it’s best you head on out of here. We don’t need people like you in our town,” Artie said. All five of the men looked at me through squinted eyes and moved their hands towards the holsters on their waists. I took another sip of my beer.

“Look, I’m just trying to have a drink here,” I said. “So how about you guys just shut the fuck up and let me black out in peace, alright? Keep on with the questions and I might just lose my goddamn temper.”

They all stood up at once. Most of them were bigger than I thought they'd be, though the moustached man was a full head shorter than everyone else.

“Boy, if you don’t get out of here, you’re gonna be sorry,” Artie said. It didn’t sound like a threat. He really just wanted me to leave. But fuck him. Who the fuck is he?

“It’s a free country. I can drink wherever the fuck I want,” I said. I went to take another sip of my beer, but it was empty. I probably would’ve been on my way out anyway if they hadn’t said anything to me. Not anymore.

I stood up, stumbling a little, and looked Artie in the eyes. Two of the men pulled their guns out.

“What are you gonna do?” I said, “Shoot me for sittin’ here drinkin’?”

“Naw, we wouldn’t do that,” Artie said, “but I bet the law would have a few questions about how you got those holes in your scooter if we called ‘em up. Or you can just go on and get.”

I looked at the two armed men. “Those are some nice guns,” I said. “I bet the serial numbers aren't filed off or anything. If you're gonna go waiving them around, I hope you at least know how to use them.”

With that, our conversation was over. The moustached man pushed Artie out of the way and swung at me. But his swing was slow, clumsy, and easy to dodge. It was the punch of a man who’d never been in a real, life-or-death fistfight. You don’t live long on the streets if you can’t handle yourself, and I’d lived on the streets a long time. He wasn’t shit. He swung again, and I ducked under it and sank my fist into his liver. The poor little guy fell to the ground and curled into a ball, acting like he couldn't breathe. He probably couldn’t, to be fair.

The others decided at that moment that they didn’t want to brawl anymore. The four men still standing all pointed their guns at my chest. I put my hands up, and they throbbed with excitement.

“Woah, woah,” I said. “He swung first. I was just defending myself.”

“Get out of here, NOW, or I swear to God I’ll shoot,” one of the guys said. I hadn’t had the pleasure of talking to him yet. He was bright pink, and his sweaty blonde hair clung to his forehead. The guy behind him breathed hard through his open mouth and shook his head up and down vigorously as if to emphasize his friend's words.

I held my hands up a little higher and put on a half-assed smile. “Alright, how about we all just calm down? Let’s all just breathe and count to three. It helps with anger management. My school counselor taught me that. Let’s just try it, ok?”

They did not look like they wanted to do any breathing exercises, and they did not lower their guns.

“1…”

They shook their guns at me.

“2…”

Their hands started to shake.

“3.”

Two thick streams of slime shot from my palms and knocked the men into the table behind them. The people sitting there screamed and ran into the bathroom, locking the door behind them. I got closer to the fallen men and hosed them until they were completely unable to get up, slipping in a pool of slime every time they tried. The pink one fell hard on top of the mouth breather, and their guns slipped from their hands and out of reach.

The last two men came at me – Artie from my left and a young, skinny boy from my right. I made double-barrelled finger guns and shot them both in their eyes. They screamed like dying animals. It must’ve burned like mace the way they were hollering – or they were just pussies. While they were blinded, I slicked the floor beneath them and they fell, cracking their heads on the hardwood floor.

I casually walked up to the slime-soaked table, picked up the two guns, and tucked them into my pants.

“Thanks, never know when you might need one of these,” I said. “See you boys later. Thanks for the warm welcome.”

Goodbye, Bryson City.

It wasn’t too far to Chattanooga now; just another day or so, and one good thing came out of this pit stop: I knew Mickey had passed through here and that I was on the right track.

I rode through the night, trying to get as far away from that place as possible. In the dark, I could see that my markings were glowing a faint red. Taking on five men at once wasn’t quite enough to impress the slime this time, it seemed. Something about knowing it wanted more from me made me want to do more. I wanted to see what the next level was, what new power I would be given. I thought about stopping at a few more towns and getting into a few more barfights before I got to Tennessee, but I figured that killing Mickey – another marked man – should be enough to satisfy the slime.

Now I had two reasons to kill that motherfucker.

Review of 1 Hotel Hanalei Bay

I want to start by saying that 1 Hotel Hanalei Bay is not a bad hotel, in fact, it’s stunning in many ways. But overall, our stay fell short of our expectations for the price and brand. Primarily in the areas of services and dining. 

The Positives

The grounds are spectacular, seamlessly blending with the surrounding landscape. Everywhere you look, you’re met with lush greenery and water features that make the property feel naturally part of Kauai’s beauty. The views from the terraces are truly unmatched, and the infinity pool, open 24 hours, is a genuine highlight.

The gym deserves special mention; it’s one of the best hotel fitness centers I’ve ever seen, perfect for anyone who likes to stay active while traveling. 

The breakfast buffet was also exceptional, with a wide range of healthy yet creative dishes that made mornings a pleasure.

The Negatives

Most of our criticisms come down to expectations versus the actual atmosphere. The overall vibe feels more like a curated Instagram backdrop rather than one of understated luxury. 

The Welina Terrace restaurant, for example, is clearly designed to attract outside guests. During dinner, it wasn’t unusual for non-hotel visitors to lean over our table to take selfies with the view. That, combined with the high noise levels - a DJ on the first night, followed by live musicians playing too loudly to converse comfortably made it difficult to relax. For a property charging over $1,100 per night, it didn’t feel like the experience was meant for guests.

The food at the hotel’s main restaurant was fine, but not exceptional; more mid-range dining at fine-dining prices. Very basic wine program. In addition, restaurant operations felt disorganized: despite having reservations, we often found staff scrambling to prepare our table when we arrived. As an addition, on days we did not make reservations, there would be long waits for tables. I have never stayed at a high-end hotel that did not hold tables for guests. I should not have to make a reservation for the hotel restaurant. 

The clientele mix also impacts the atmosphere. Many guests seemed to be working remotely, meaning that a quiet morning coffee with a view was often interrupted by someone taking a Teams call nearby. Which is surprising given that the WiFi is painfully slow, and spotty. 

Service and Housekeeping

Our biggest objective issue was housekeeping. The hotel uses an exterior light system: green for service requested, red for do not disturb, but three days in a row we received texts saying, “We went to your room, but the light was red,” despite it being set correctly. It often felt like we had to chase down staff to get the room cleaned. On the third day, it took two visits to the lobby to get service. They rectified it (and included a bottle of prosecco) Even when service occurred, small details were missed (like replacing silverware), and a laundry pickup request went completely unaddressed.

The Rooms

As seems common nowadays, the bathrooms feature a sliding door with no fan, and a rainfall shower without a door. The vanity feels intrusive being right in the middle of the room. It becomes difficult to not disturb your partner when getting up to use the rest room, or getting ready in the morning. 

Final Thoughts

1 Hotel Hanalei Bay is a visually stunning property with incredible natural surroundings and excellent amenities. However, the execution and service don’t yet live up to the luxury price point. With more attention to guest experience and consistency, it could easily become one of Hawaii’s best, but for now, it feels like a beautiful hotel still learning how to deliver five-star service.

1og039z,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1og039z/a_thought_for_if_you_are_hard_on_yourself_for_not/,A thought for if you are hard on yourself for not being “perfect”,"I’ve been reading Crying at Hmart, a memoir by the lead singer of Japanese Breakfast, Michelle Zauner, and something stuck out to me. She talked about her sweet cousin who suffered from severe acne, and how complex his skincare regimen was. He even washed his face with bottled water. That stuck out to me (as a former severe acne sufferer). When you don’t know the cause of something, you try every last thing you think might help— even though people with perfect skin almost certainly just use tap water. In my case, the acne was hormonal. It didn’t clear up with anything but birth control. Bottled water wouldn’t have helped. But it does reflect the desperation you feel.

It reminded me of struggling with fertility quite a lot. I cleaned up my diet, exercise regularly, I’m a healthy weight, no obvious health problems. I tried a bunch of supplements. I switched to organic food only. I avoid processed food. I started using cosmetics with only clean ingredients. The only thing I didn’t give up was coffee. I tried so hard. I was pretty type A about the whole thing— blaming myself for failing to eat perfectly. Failing to go to yoga regularly. Etc.

Well, during a recent hysteroscopy that my clinic does prior to FETs, it was found that I have a bunch of fibroids and obvious inflammation. Could have been caused by my having low vitamin D for a while, who knows. I won’t get my Receptiva result for a bit so still don’t know if there are further issues like endo. But all the organic eggs and clean ingredients in the world couldn’t have erased those fibroids. I had a feeling there was something about my uterus that was “unfriendly” so I’m weirdly relieved something was found, and there’s a surgery for it.

If your issues are “unexplained” like mine were/are, don’t blame yourself. There *is* a cause, whether it’s currently known or not, and it’s almost certainly not something minor you’re doing or not doing. Of course it’s great to be healthy for you and the potential pregnancy. But organic eggs aren’t going to make or break things. Bottled water isn’t going to solve severe acne, either. Be easy on yourself. It’s not your fault.

I think it’s so important to push for the tests you want prior to transfer. I opted to do all optional testing. I hope you get answers and things work out for every single woman reading this. ❤️

I just graduated college back in May with a degree in dietetics and decided to go straight into grad school. I was never super into nutrition and chose it mainly because I love food and cooking (which turns out is not what dietetics is about lol). The program I’m in now is an amazing program, very clinically focused and will pretty much guarantee me a registered dietitian job when I graduate in two years. I’m constantly hearing from people how lucky I am, and my peers are super into the program. However, I’m feeling very very lost.

I’m not sure I even want to be a dietitian. To be honest, I have no idea what I want to do. In undergrad I thought about changing majors all the time and didn’t because I knew it would be more work to make up, but now I’m wishing I had. I was also a college athlete, which I was incredibly passionate about and distracted me from the uncertainty of an actual career.

I also ended up moving back in with my parents for this program, which has been an adventure on its own (but I save a lot of money). My hometown friends are all gone, and I commute to school so I feel pretty lonely and removed from my peers there. College was also in Colorado, so I got used to the lifestyle there, and being back in suburban Texas is very different.

To sum it up, I’m really not happy with my situation. I feel like I chose grad school because it was an answer to the uncertainty in my life. Now it feels like I’m wasting time and money, and my grades are slipping because I’m not motivated in this field. But passing up this opportunity feels like a waste, because I would be disappointing parents/other people by not continuing this program. I’ve been telling myself that in two years I can get the hell out of Texas, maybe reunite with friends, and find a dietitian job that’s guaranteed a steady income. But will I even enjoy it?

I’m considering deferring for a year at the end of this semester to give myself time to think. If I could go back to a year ago, I would’ve 100% told myself to take a gap year, stay in my college town, and just work in a coffee shop/do some career exploring to give my brain a break. But if I did defer, I have no idea where to go, if I could afford it, what I would do, etc.

Any insight/advice is appreciated, just feeling very very lost and disappointed.

1og026g,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1og026g/some_advice_on_recruitment_i_got_i_will_not/,Some advice on recruitment I got [I will not promote],"I recently got some advice on recruitment for early startups that I thought was interesting, so I thought I'd share it here. 

First of all, he divided the labour market into two types of people, with 3 levels of risk:


1. Those who want to be paid market rate for their skills, he called these people ""traders"" 

Risk level 3: consultant 

Risk level 2: changes job every 2 years 

Risk level 1: stays at the same employer for a long time 


2. Those who are willing to invest their skills in order to get a 10X in the future, sacrificing short term market rate pay for long term ROI, he called these people ""entrepreneurs"" 

Risk level 3: founders 

Risk level 2: early employees of startups 

Risk level 3: late employees of startups, but they are still attracted to equity and stock options 

Now, he said one common mistake for startups is trying to hire traders too early. One way of doing that is to copy a job description from a large corporation and then use that when trying to recruit for your own startup. He said that's dumb, and that you only have two jobs in an early startup - builder and seller. You should only look for, and recruit, a builder or a seller. Even by having a long job description you are going to attract traders.

He also said that you should use entrepreneurs for any problem that isn't actually solved yet, when you don't actually know the best way to do it etc. The sale strategy/commercialization strategy is still being built and you need an entrepreneur for that. Once you have figured out how tasks should be done, you should have a trader.

He said another common mistake that startups make is when they look for someone with 5 years experience, and realize they can't afford to attract that talent, is that they look for someone with 2-3 years experience instead. The correct solution is to look for someone with 15-20 years experience. Senior/experienced people probably have enough money in the bank to be able to be more willing and able to work for equity and think about long term gains rather than actually needing their current market rate to survive, which younger people do.

Now, an early startup needs everyone to belong to the entrepreneur group. How to find them? He gave the following advice:

* Keep track of other startups, many fail, it's easy to keep track of when they're about to run out of money. Take staff from those companies. 

* When startups are doing series A investment and are obviously expanding and recruiting more people, it's actually a good time to recruit from them. This is because they now have staff that joined that startup in the early stages, their cliff from that equity is gone and that organization now has a need for traders, so those skills from their early hires are better suited at your early stage startup. 

* When you see companies hiring new leadership/management, it's a good time to try to recruit people below that manager. 

Then, he said what to actually do:
Track them down on LinkedIn. Traders have good information and a professional picture, so avoid those. Startups should be looking for those who have shit profiles but it's clear they work for the correct company and you have an idea of what they do. 

Then, write to them a very brief message and say who you are, what your company does, and that you are looking to commercialize your product. Ask for a coffee to pick their brain. That's it. 

He said you should only want a meeting with someone who has their own ideas on how to commercialize your product, because they actually have the skills, and they won't take the coffee unless they have those ideas, so no other information is necessary.

1og016s,https://www.reddit.com/r/croatian/comments/1og016s/advice_for_learning_croatian_from_zero_with/,Advice for Learning Croatian from Zero with Comprehensible Input?,"Hi all, for some brief background, I'm an American college student of Croatian origin. My father moved to the US right before the war and spoke to me in Croatian up until around the age of 5 and stopped once I hit kindergarten. This means aside from the absolute basics, I'm essentially unable to communicate or understand anything of the language besides the absolute basics.

This past week, I was staying with my family in Osijek and then Zagreb while I was on break for university (I'm currently in Italy). It was just so demoralizing barely being able to handle myself when doing something as simple as ordering coffee or being introduced to family friends. People immediately see or hear my name there (one of the top 3 most common in Croatia) and always have a look of slight disapproval when they realize I'm incapable of holding any form of conversation in Croatian. This has always happened, as I've visited maybe every other year since I was very young, but now that I've gotten older, its ignited a more committed motivation to finally learn the language.

Sob story aside, I'm B1 in Spanish and have done so almost entirely through CI, particularly Dreaming Spanish and some Netflix series. Now that I'm living in Italy, I'm surrounded by input all the time, and my Romance language background has made it so that picking up the language has happened at a rapid pace. My question for you all is how do you even start a language like Croatian with this method? Even nailing the basics seems like such as hassle due to such a low demand for beginner level content, and even children's cartoons are currently above my level.

If any of you have any sources that worked for you starting from the ground up, please feel free to share. I've read the megathread and seen there are sources like Easy Croatian on YT, however, these videos are definitely way above the level necessary for me to actually acquire the language. Did you guys use a private tutor? Did you painstakingly google translate all of your content until it became more clear? And before anyone recommends a grammar book, I feel like besides getting down the basics of the cases, dedicating more time to that instead of just raw input would likely drive me insane. 

Hope to hear what worked for you all <3",2,1761419779.0,croatian,5,0.75,False
1og00w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/1og00w9/feeling_lost_in_grad_programstuck_in_life/,Feeling lost in grad program/stuck in life,"Sorry for the lengthy post ahead of time.

I just graduated college back in May with a degree in dietetics and decided to go straight into grad school. I was never super into nutrition and chose it mainly because I love food and cooking (which turns out is not what dietetics is about lol). The program I’m in now is an amazing program, very clinically focused and will pretty much guarantee me a registered dietitian job when I graduate in two years. I’m constantly hearing from people how lucky I am, and my peers are super into the program. However, I’m feeling very very lost.

I’m not sure I even want to be a dietitian. To be honest, I have no idea what I want to do. In undergrad I thought about changing majors all the time and didn’t because I knew it would be more work to make up, but now I’m wishing I had. I was also a college athlete, which I was incredibly passionate about and distracted me from the uncertainty of an actual career.

I also ended up moving back in with my parents for this program, which has been an adventure on its own (but I save a lot of money). My hometown friends are all gone, and I commute to school so I feel pretty lonely and removed from my peers there. College was also in Colorado, so I got used to the lifestyle there, and being back in suburban Texas is very different.

To sum it up, I’m really not happy with my situation. I feel like I chose grad school because it was an answer to the uncertainty in my life. Now it feels like I’m wasting time and money, and my grades are slipping because I’m not motivated in this field. But passing up this opportunity feels like a waste, because I would be disappointing parents/other people by not continuing this program. I’ve been telling myself that in two years I can get the hell out of Texas, maybe reunite with friends, and find a dietitian job that’s guaranteed a steady income. But will I even enjoy it?

I’m considering deferring for a year at the end of this semester to give myself time to think. If I could go back to a year ago, I would’ve 100% told myself to take a gap year, stay in my college town, and just work in a coffee shop/do some career exploring to give my brain a break. But if I did defer, I have no idea where to go, if I could afford it, what I would do, etc.

Any insight/advice is appreciated, just feeling very very lost and disappointed.

1og00k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1og00k8/is_this_opening_good_for_an_upmarket_commercial/,Is this opening good for an upmarket commercial historical fiction?,"August 1914.

Nikolai Volkov’s hands trembled around his rifle as the earth around him shivered. A shell screamed overhead—metal tearing the sky—and when it hit, it spat fire and mud. Limbs, blood, and boots arced through the air, painting the dawn scarlet.

He dropped to his knees. The stench of charred flesh and iron clawed at his throat. Somewhere, a comrade’s scream cut short. Somewhere else, nothing but silence.

His father’s words echoed like a curse: “God, King, and Country—a con game to make boys dig their own graves.”

Nikolai tasted it now—the bitter truth on his tongue, soaked in smoke and blood, as the regiment he’d known vanished into a living nightmare.

The first shell arrives with a sound like the world tearing. Not an explosion—that comes after—but the scream of its descent, a shriek that starts high and thin somewhere in the August sky and drops into a bass roar that rattles teeth. Nikolai has exactly one and a half seconds to register this before the shell punches into the earth twenty meters ahead and the ground erupts.​

Dirt becomes shrapnel. The soil here is black and wet—East Prussian farmland that smells like shit and peat—and when the high-explosive charge detonates, it transforms into a horizontal storm of clods and rocks and metal fragments moving faster than thought. 

The men in the forward line—Third Company, good Russian boys who were singing drinking songs two hours ago—disappear. Not die. Disappear. One moment they're human beings with faces and names and letters from home folded in their pockets. The next they're components of the red mist that hangs in the air like fog.​

Nikolai hits the dirt. Face-first into mud that tastes like copper and rot. His rifle—Mosin-Nagant Model 1891, five-round magazine, bolt-action, the Tsar's gift to his loyal sons—flies from his hands and lands somewhere he can't see. Doesn't matter. Can't shoot at shells.​

The second shell lands closer.

The sound is physical. It enters through his ears and his skin and his open mouth and shakes him from the inside like someone grabbed his spine and rang it like a bell. His vision whites out. When it returns—half a second, full second—he's staring at Private Dmitri Kashin's boots.​

Just the boots. Feet still inside. The rest of Dmitri is somewhere else, scattered across the crater that wasn't there five seconds ago.

Third shell. Fourth. Fifth. The Germans have found their range and now they're working the line with methodical precision, walking the barrage through the Russian positions like a farmer plowing a field. Each impact creates a crater four meters wide and two meters deep, and the craters fill instantly with groundwater that bubbles up black and oily.

Bodies—pieces of bodies—tumble into the water and float there, face-down, limbs at wrong angles.
Captain Volodya Ilyin is screaming orders. Can't hear the words over the artillery, but Nikolai can see his mouth moving, see the spittle flying from his lips. The Captain has his saber out—actual goddamn saber like this is 1812 and Napoleon's coming over the hill—and he's pointing it toward the German lines three hundred meters away.
Advance. That's what the saber means. Advance into the artillery that's turning men into mist.
Sixth shell lands ten meters to Nikolai's left. The blast wave picks him up and throws him sideways into Private Leonid Sokolov. They land together in a tangle of limbs and equipment. Leonid is making a high-pitched keening sound, the noise a rabbit makes when the trap breaks its leg. His left arm is gone below the elbow. The stump is pumping blood in rhythmic spurts that paint Nikolai's face in hot arterial spray.

Nikolai rolls away. Finds his feet. Looks for the Captain.

Captain Ilyin is still standing, still pointing his saber forward. Then the seventh shell arrives and the Captain becomes a pink cloud and the saber spins through the air like a thrown knife and buries itself point-first in the mud three meters away, quivering.

That's when Nikolai understands.This isn't war. This is harvesting. The Germans are harvesting Russians the way you harvest wheat—mechanically, efficiently, without passion or hate. They're sitting in their artillery positions five kilometers back, drinking coffee probably, turning wheels and pulling lanyards while Russian boys dissolve into component elements.
And the Tsar wants Nikolai to advance into it.
God and King and Country.
Fuck that.

Eighth shell. Nikolai runs.

Not forward. Not back. Sideways. Away from the Captain's atomized corpse and Leonid's keening and Dmitri's boots. He runs bent double, legs pumping, boots squelching through mud that grabs at his ankles like hands. Around him the world is ending in fire and noise. Men are screaming. Equipment is burning. A horse—one of the supply cart horses—gallops past with its intestines dragging behind it like wet rope, eyes rolling white.

He runs for the tree line fifty meters east. If he can reach the trees—
Ninth shell lands directly in his path.

The crater appears beneath his feet mid-stride. One moment there's ground. Next there's nothing. Nikolai falls.

The crater is deeper than it looked—three meters, maybe four—and the bottom is already filling with black water. He hits the surface and goes under. The water is cold and tastes like metal and shit. His boots touch bottom—soft, yielding—and he pushes off, breaks the surface gasping.

Something solid bumps against his leg.

He looks down through the murky water. Sees a face looking back at him. Eyes open. Mouth slack. Skin paper-white. Corporal Pavel Morozov, who taught Nikolai how to cheat at cards three weeks ago during the long train ride from Moscow. Pavel is missing the top of his head. The brain cavity is visible, pale and hollow like an empty bowl.

Nikolai vomits into the water he's treading. The vomit floats. He pushes it away.

Above him, the artillery continues. He can see the edge of the crater—a lip of torn earth and torn men—and beyond it the August sky, very blue, very calm, completely indifferent to the industrial-scale murder happening below it.

He needs to get out. Needs to move.

But where?

Forward is death. Back is death. Staying here is death. The shells are walking through the Russian lines in a pattern, and sooner or later one will land directly in this crater and Nikolai will join Pavel in the underwater cemetery.

Then he sees the Captain.

Not Captain Ilyin—Ilyin is mist now, probably drifting toward Berlin on the wind. A different captain. Captain Sergei Federov of Second Company. Federov is lying on the eastern rim of the crater, half in and half out of the water. His uniform is shredded. His face is gray. There's a hole in his chest the size of a fist.​

But his eyes are open.

Federov sees Nikolai. Their gazes lock. The Captain's lips move. No sound comes out—drowned by the artillery—but Nikolai can read the word.​

Help.

Nikolai stares at him. Calculates. The Captain is dying. Anyone can see that. The chest wound is sucking air with each breath, bubbling pink foam. He's got minutes, maybe less.

But he's also got a captain's coat. Thick wool. Good quality. Worth something.

And a captain's boots. Leather. Real leather, not the cardboard shit they issued to conscripts.​
And in his pockets—probably—a few rubles. Maybe a flask. Maybe bread.​

The artillery walks closer. Three shells land in rapid succession fifty meters west. The ground shakes. More men scream. A machine gun starts chattering somewhere—Russian, by the sound of it—firing blind into the smoke.

Federov's lips move again. Same word. Help.
Nikolai pulls himself out of the water. Mud and corpse-water stream from his clothes. He crawls to the Captain on his belly, staying below the crater's rim. Up close, Federov smells like cordite and bowel. The chest wound is worse than Nikolai thought. He can see bone. Can see the lung underneath, punctured, deflating.

""Help me,"" Federov whispers. His voice is a wet rasp. ""Please. I have a wife. Two daughters. Anna. Maria. Please.""

Nikolai takes the Captain's coat. Unbuttons it with quick fingers, pulls it free while Federov gasps and whimpers. The coat is heavy. Warm. There's blood on it but blood washes out.​

""What are you doing?"" Federov's eyes are wide now. Understanding dawning. ""No. No. Soldier, I order you—""

Nikolai takes the boots. Pulls them off while Federov tries to kick, but the Captain has no strength left and the kicks are just weak twitches. The boots fit well. Better than the cardboard shit. His feet feel instantly warmer.

Pockets next. Left pocket: a silver cigarette case. Mother-of-pearl inlay. Worth maybe twenty rubles. Right pocket: a flask. Nikolai unscrews it, sniffs. Vodka. Good vodka, not the rotgut the enlisted men get. Inner pocket: a wallet. Forty-three rubles in paper notes. A photograph of two little girls in white dresses, standing in a garden somewhere that isn't being shelled into rubble.

Nikolai pockets everything.

Federov is crying now. Tears cutting tracks through the mud on his face. ""Please. Please. My wife.""
""Your wife is going to get a letter from the Tsar,"" Nikolai says. His voice sounds strange to his own ears. Flat. Empty. Like something died inside him when the first shell landed. ""It'll tell her you died a hero. For God and King and Country.

He crawls away. Leaves Federov weeping in the mud. Behind him the Captain tries to call out—maybe to curse him, maybe to beg again—but another shell lands close and the sound is swallowed by the blast.

Nikolai doesn't look back.

The artillery barrage lasts another forty minutes. Nikolai spends it at the bottom of the crater, pressed against the eastern wall with Pavel's corpse floating beside him and three other bodies he doesn't recognize keeping them company. The shells march back and forth across the Russian positions like a metronome. Each impact sends a shockwave through the water that slaps against his chest. His ears are ringing. His hands are shaking. Every time a shell lands close he pisses himself a little, and after the fifth or sixth time he stops bothering to be ashamed.

Above him, the screaming continues. Men calling for their mothers. Men calling for medics who aren't coming. Men just making sounds that aren't words anymore, animal noises, the sounds you make when the body forgets how to be human.
When the barrage finally stops, the silence is worse than the noise.

Nikolai waits ten minutes—counts the seconds in his head, loses track twice, starts over—before he risks looking over the crater's rim.

1ofzzv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ofzzv0/the_hotel_room_and_laundromat/,The Hotel Room and Laundromat,"The year is 2018. Received an email from a address I never seen before as I was walking outside in my neighborhood. I though ""Argh, probably just spam"" due to the heading ""Congratulations! You are one of the lucky winners in the competition.'' I placed my phone back into my pocket waiting for someone I guess but I can't remember it fully. Something about the email bothered me, I opened my email again and read though the whole thing, rethinking this might not be a scam. Listed my type of phone, my network provider and an airline popular back then before they shutdown. Then I realized that I entered a competition when I got my new phone which I totally forgot about. 

Had to go to a store of my service provider to ""receive my prize'' - which felt awkward as the staff did not know what I was talking about but a manager realized what it was about. An all expenses paid holiday to a certain amount and anywhere I want to go as long as its listed on the website of the airline. 

  
Fast forward, I selected the places where I wanted to go, everything got finalized in May 2019. The morning of our trip (Mid-June), we went to the airport with an Uber and had breakfast at one of the restaurants - the problem? Well our flight got delayed by 5h45mins, a scheduled morning flight pushed back to the afternoon due to poor visibility due to fog. We arrived around 16:45 (4:45pm) at out destination airport - only a 2 hour flight which felt like a breeze. Our shuttle driver collected us at the arrivals section and now we had to travel by car for 2h30min to our hotel. Arrived at the hotel checked in, my room in the middle of the halfway and my parents room down the hallway around a bend. 

  
The first night was truly uneventful we only had dinner and decided to get into bed early. Following morning we decided to explore a bit as this is more of a resort then just a plain hotel. In total we stayed at the hotel for a week. The weird experiences began on the 2nd to last evening. I was at the time a rough sleeper, I manage to fall asleep easily but once 2am/3am hits I sit awake for an hour. I don't know what time this was but I struggled to keep my eyes open as I saw a figure sitting on the couch of my bedroom. I could make out the outline of the person but I can't see their face, two key things I remember about this figure. It was sitting like a women (cross-legged) but wore a brim hat. My eyes struggling to stay open, I lift my head, it does not want me to, I can't speak, nothing is coming out of my mouth. My body decided to say f-you go back to sleep mfer. Woke up later the morning but nothing seemed out of place. But I can still remember what I saw, I just blew it off and went to breakfast with my parents.

  
Our last evening at our hotel I was already in bed watching the Women's Football World Cup on the TV. I fell asleep while watching but in the middle of the match I woke up with the tv playing no sound but still had visuals - found this odd as I never turned down the volume. Fell back asleep and when waking up again the TV was off this time. What the fuck is going on here? My mind should have told me OP get the fuck up and just go to your parents - but why wake  them up about something so stupid. 5am hits and I wake up with the light on in my room. This is when I started to freak out a bit as that part of the room light only goes on when there motion/movement when entering that room. I crawled out of my bedroom looking around if I can see someone and if my belongings is missing. Nothing was missing and I walked back to my bed and that is when my heart dropped down to my stomach. I did not sleep alone that night, something/someone was in that bed with me. Bed cover was in such a way where they opened themselves and left it open, there was also a dent in the sheet on that side of the bed. I know at that time my dad was awake by then since he never could sleep late, I called him and went to their room, they thought I was making that shit up once I told them both the story. They send me to my room as we all got dressed for breakfast.  Afterwards I let them inside my room as they also notice what I saw and both realized I was not making up the story. 

  
The rest of our trip, well was pretty uneventful and nothing else happened. Once we got home and such I noticed dark figures around the corners wherever I would go like something/someone is following me. My parents joked about it with me and just said 'its the lady from the hotel.' That joke sticked for years and years afterwards that she is following me. 

This was the beginning when I started noticing things around me that was 'not normal'. 

Got a job as an intern in a hotel in PA, USA. Besides the pandemic at the time nothing really uneventful happened. Saw a deer in the middle of the road - well... he/she was not with us anymore at that time... roadkill. Normally my shifts were random but at one stage it got to a fixed timeslot 03:00pm to 11:00pm. My housing was close to the hotel/resort I was working at and was walking distance. Well, walking down that patch of forest area was always, well bone chilling especially when I was alone. Got jump scared my a deer the one time when I barely heard it coming up behind me. Only really  other thing that happened was the yellow eyes watching me as I was walking home, was most likely some fox or some animal. 

The year is now 2021. September. I got a new job in my home country. Interview went quite well for me. Got the job, but not the position that I applied for. Since my housekeeping background from the states they throwed me in there. A young man as a Housekeeping Supervisor while the manager is about to pack her bags and leave the company. It went well for me, people welcomed me with open arms. 02 January, another new person was at the front desk and I was staying in a room close to reception that evening. (I still don't get why we didn't have a night auditor at that time and why they would trust a newbie to stay over). I got a phone call from my colleague...  'OP the laundry is burning'.  I jumped up and tried to look through the bedroom window and just saw smoke floating over the pool area... our morning coffees had to change, where we sit outside the laundry looking at broken doors, tape covering the entrance and just the smell looming in the air. Winter came along and then it happened, at that time it was dark, and I saw it... this time hanging from the timber beam outside the laundry door, I could see a face this time. It had a clown face (last week I watched 'Tarot' this is more or less how the clown's face looked like). My body went cold, I looked down at my colleagues who I was chatting with and when I looked back the person was gone. 

The hotel can sometimes feel very uneasy with the sliding door randomly opening or a noise somewhere in the lobby that should not be there. This year it was something else as the walkie-talkie radio's was thrown from one side of the room to the other side while my colleague was doing her work.

My final experience came  when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I walked back to my room and it just felt like a women was screaming at me while I was walking and pushing  her face into mine. Let's just say that I was awake for a bit before I could sleep again.

When I was younger we use to go to events like parties with people my extended family knew or friends from my father's old work. There was two boys - who would always tell that their were born with the caul. They could see stuff that other people could not see. About a principal who fell to his death at a school the one time when he was climbing a tree. The story always felt silly to me and unbelievable. But maybe there is stuff around us that some of us can't see... dark figures looming around us in the corners of our eyes. 

Take my stories as you see fit. I just wanted to share some of my personal experiences. ",2,1761419689.0,Paranormal,1,0.75,False

To sum it up, I’m really not happy with my situation. I feel like I chose grad school because it was an answer to the uncertainty in my life. Now it feels like I’m wasting time and money, and my grades are slipping because I’m not motivated in this field. But passing up this opportunity feels like a waste, because I would be disappointing parents/other people by not continuing this program. I’ve been telling myself that in two years I can get the hell out of Texas, maybe reunite with friends, and find a dietitian job that’s guaranteed a steady income. But will I even enjoy it?

I’m considering deferring for a year at the end of this semester to give myself time to think. If I could go back to a year ago, I would’ve 100% told myself to take a gap year, stay in my college town, and just work in a coffee shop/do some career exploring to give my brain a break. But if I did defer, I have no idea where to go, if I could afford it, what I would do, etc.

Any insight/advice is appreciated, just feeling very very lost and disappointed.

1ofzv02,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ofzv02/my_siblings_and_i_were_destined_to_kill_each/,My siblings and I were destined to kill each other at the age of twenty two.,"I wish I could tell you that being a witch is exactly how it's portrayed on TV.

When I was a little girl, I watched Kiki’s Delivery Service for the first time, and I immediately turned to my mother and asked where my broomstick was. 

Kiki was my first awakening into my powers. I was seven years old when I sent a bowl of choco pops into my brother’s face without using my hands. 

I wasn't a witch like Kiki, though. 

My family had a coven, so magic naturally ran through our veins. 

I could move things with my mind, and *sometimes* levitate objects. 

My brother could generate light magic between his fingers, and with concentration, my sister could turn broccoli into ice-cream. 

This was the reality of being a young witch, a whole new playground to discover and figure out. The world felt almost tangible, like it was mine to contort between my fingers. 

Objects could fly, and animals could talk if I could find the right charm. 

When I started consuming witch media, I couldn't wait to receive my broomstick, and find my feline familiar. 

But that's not what being a witch is. 

I was ten years old when I discovered my siblings and I would not live past the age of twenty two, and Kiki’s Delivery Service was just a human’s fantasy of what I witch really was. 

I naively thought it was a natural half witch's death, and I was weirdly okay with it. 

I would rather die a witch than become a human. 

Thanks to my mother’s subtle brainwashing, I was fully against leaving my coven behind. 

However, no, that wasn't it. 

Witches with siblings do live past the age of twenty two. 

Only one can become a full witch. 

I was in denial, trying to convince myself that I would become human. 

My brother and sister weren't going to die, right? 

Where was *that* in my favorite movie?  

Mom broke it to me gently. 

The ritual is not a transfer of power.

It is a fight to the death, and then a sacrifice. 

Only one of us would obtain our family's magic, carving it from the other two, and taking it for themselves. 

According to our coven, magic cannot be evenly shared between siblings. 

Especially triplets.

Magic cannot be transferred. Witch’s have tried in the past, with the results killing subjects and ripping coven’s apart. In witch media, magic is tangible. 

It can be moulded and touched, appearing to the naked eye in colorful light. In the real world, magic is not a physical thing. We can generate light, but physical magic does not exist. 

It is entwined inside our souls, part of our beating heart, and can only be stolen, ripped from the soul of a dead witch. 

Magic must choose a dominating body and soul. 

For only children, they automatically become full witches when reaching adulthood, adopting their parent’s power. 

But for us, becoming a full witch is a brutal fight. 

Magic does not choose a soul. It is up to the siblings themselves to decide who gets it. 

In our case, it's different. 

We were born on the exact day, under the same moon, binding us to each other, our souls and magic entangling. 

All siblings are given a deadline. 

If magic does *not* find a dominating body on their twenty second birthday, the magic returns to the parent, and the siblings become what is called Empty. 

Empty is neither human nor witch, a vacant shell drained of personality and thought. 

Empty’s can be twisted and contorted by what is called velvet magic, and be turned into soldiers, so they are put down before their bodies can be used. 

So, yeah. 

Either betray and murder my siblings, or become a mindless shell. 

When my mother was pregnant with us, she was advised to abort us. 

Twins and triplets are rare among our coven, but when they are born, their fate’s are already sealed to end in a bloodbath. 

With our magic split three ways, our lives were ticking time bombs. 

I would rather have been aborted in the womb than be granted twenty two years of life, only to have it ripped from me by my own blood. 

Mom, however, saw us less like her children, more akin to bull’s in a ring. 

Mom has always been intense, obsessed with her family's power, and her place by our grandmother, the head of the Montgomery coven’s side. 

She wanted to see us fight for her magic, and for our right to stand as the surviving Montgomery witch. 

Mom wanted a bloodbath. She never saw me as a daughter. 

Instead, I was a tribute. 

As children, our bedtime story was her own ritual as an eighteen year old. 

Mom had two brothers. 

I don't know their names, she never talked about them like they were her siblings. 

Instead, she treated them more like contestants. 

Who she beat. 

I know the story so well, each detail ingrained inside my skull. 

I know exactly how she murdered them in perfect detail, revelling in their power and becoming a full witch. 

Unlike us, she wasn't a triplet or a twin. Her ritual wasn't taken as seriously as ours would be, so she could kill them and take their magic at any point. 

She killed one brother at his job, ripping his heart out, and the other brother at home, slicing his throat. 

Mom described it like it was a euphoric experience, that absorbing the power from her brother’s dying corpse filled her with pleasure. 

Mom told us it was either her or them. 

When we discovered what would happen to us, I thought it was a joke. 

I mean, I heard rumors about the blood witch's barbaric rituals, but they were like myths, scary stories to frighten young witches. 

Blood witches intentionally hurt humans for their own enjoyment. 

The Carlisle coven are a well known story. I used to have nightmares about them when I was a kid. 

Mom made it clear that because we were triplets, and the stakes were higher, our ritual would be treated like a ceremony, held on our twenty second birthday. 

My brother locked himself in his room for three days, and I made it clear I wouldn't be taking part. I tried to run away when I was fourteen. 

I say *tried*, because I got as far as west Virginia, searching for our human father. 

He ran away when Mom revealed his three children wouldn't live past the age of twenty two. After some digging around, I found his name. 

Samuel Lockhart. 

He was human, and a professor, according to social media. 

He didn't have a profile picture. 

Well, he did, but it was a robin on a snowy branch.

It looked like he was a photographer, but I couldn't see any of his profile. 

What I did have was half of a physical photo. 

Mom tore it apart, so dad’s face was gone. Still, I could see the location, a towering brick building which could only be the college he worked at. 

I planned on starting there. When we were kids, Mom had forbidden us to talk about dad, calling him a coward for running away from his own children. 

Dad just had common sense. 

He was a human who didn't understand the witch world, and I don't think he could deal with bringing up children who were destined to die. 

I got as far as the train station in Dad’s hometown, oblivious that I was already being tracked down. 

Mom forced my brother to cast a teleportation spell, which she knew would drain him, and because our souls and powers are entwined, it would drain me too. 

The only thing that does not affect us as a three is magic itself. 

If I were to paralyse my sister (I have in the past, when she's repeatedly stolen my clothes) neither me, nor our brother would be affected. 

However, if my brother was to cast a spell garnering colossal amounts of power, such as teleportation or soul transference, all three of us would be physically affected. 

We share things like tiredness and sickness. If they're sick, so am I. 

If my sister was coughing her guts up with the flu, or staying up all night to watch a new Netflix series, then all three of us paid the consequences. 

We shared each other's pain. 

When we were younger, of course we took advantage. 

If the other two were annoying me, I pinched myself. 

When Callie fell off of her bike, Eli and I *felt* the sting of her cut, and the gravel stuck to her hand. 

I broke my leg falling out a tree when I was seven, and all of us ended up in the hospital. 

It was my leg that was broken, but Callie and Eli could feel the electroshocks running up and down my knee. 

I had the stomach flu, and they felt the crippling nausea in my gut, but never actually barfed.

Mom was smart.

She didn't have to send our coven after me, because she already had her secret weapons. 

Eli and Callie. 

I made it halfway across the train station, before my brain filled with fog, my arms dropping to my sides. 

My bag slipped off of my shoulder, and before I knew what was happening, I was on my knees, my eyes heavy, exhaustion slamming into me like tumultuous waves. 

I could feel him. 

Eli. 

His thoughts were fuzzy and distant, dancing across the back of my mind. 

*Run*. 

His voice was barely a whisper creeping into my skull. 

I couldn't run. I couldn't even move, my body filled with lead. 

Which meant he had cast a spell powerful enough to drain all three of us. 

I was aware of people asking if I was okay, but my mouth wouldn't work, every thought going supernova. 

I forgot why I was there, why I was running in the first place. 

I could sense Eli’s agony, and Callie’s brewing panic attack. 

Mom was arming both of them against me. There were images in my head, flickers of past rituals I was forced to watch on Mom’s laptop. . 

I could still see it. 

What made me run away. 

The surviving sibling, a young girl, standing with her sister’s severed head swinging from her grasp. 

Her smile was grotesque, a grin so evil, so twisted, I refused to believe she was part of our coven. 

The girl was painted, stained in the blood of her sister, and yet I couldn't see remorse or pain in her eyes, a flicker of regret or disgust. 

I only saw triumph, her gaze burning bright, emanating the power she ripped from her sibling. 

I didn't want to become that. 

Burying my head in my arms, I didn't even have the energy to sob. 

I was curled up on the train station platform when my mother found me. 

I was shivering, my eyes half lidded. 

There were two pairs of shoes in front of me. 

Mom, and Eli. 

When I forced my eyes fully open, my brother loomed over me, hiding under dark brown curls as if in shame. 

I could still see the slight glow in his eyes from the spell, magic like stardust polluting his iris. 

Magic was supposed to be beautiful, but in my brother’s eyes, it resembled a force taking over him. 

His cheeks were ashy, eyes flickering open and closed, like he wasn't sure where he was. 

Eli shared my foggy brain and whirlwind thoughts, a gnawing, painful urge to just drop. 

He was swaying side to side, like he would give in at any moment, release himself to the oblivion creeping inside his soul. 

Mom’s fingers were wrapped around his arm to prevent him from collapsing too. 

I already had an audience, and she waved them away with forced reassurances. 

“Please excuse my daughter, she's a chronic narcoleptic,” Mom laughed, scooping me into her arms. 

She treated the two of us to chocolate milkshakes on the way home. 

I thought it was an apology, but one look from my brother, idly slurping on his straw, told me she was just filling us with sugar to prevent us passing out. 

Mom was too warm. 

When she carried me out of the car, my Mom felt and smelled like home. 

Like my pillows, and our kitchen.

The flowers she decorates the walls with. 

Home. 

Ironic, because home stopped feeling like *home* after my attempt to run away. 

The Montgomery coven cast a binding spell which imprisoned us inside the house. 

I remember it felt like being ripped apart, like cold, heavy shackles tangled around my soul, biting into every nerve ending. 

The front door was now a luxury. 

If we wanted to go into the yard, we had to earn it. 

The only trips we made were with the coven, and I felt like a freak show, forced under a cloak, hidden from the outside world.

*The Montgomery triplets*, I heard a human kid say, when we strode past them on their bikes. 

“I bet they're witches.”

They started laughing, and I felt Eli’s frustration. 

I felt the sting of his fingernails carving half moons into the flesh of his palms.

I don't think my brother *meant* to send the kid flying off of his handlebars. He didn't even say the spell right, muttering it under his hood. 

After that incident, we weren't even allowed outside to see the coven. 

Mom homeschooled us, insisting that the human world was dangerous to a half witch. 

A small cult of humans who are aware of our existence, abduct half witches and use them for their own personal gain. That is true. 

Half witch abductions are fairly common. 

Still though, Mom was using our fear of humans as an excuse to keep us from running away. 

It's not like we could, with the binding spell in place, but she was wary of the human world influencing us away from the coven. 

I don't want to call it brainwashing, but from the age of fourteen, we barely left the house, separated from our human and half witch friends. 

From the age of sixteen, Mom started teaching us individually. My classes were on Monday night after dinner, while Eli and Callie’s were on weekends. 

It was obvious what Mom was trying to do. 

She was already stitching the seed into our minds that our siblings were not to be trusted. That we were secretly conspiring against each other to take the Montgomery magic for ourselves. 

I admit, I did work at first. I was naive, oblivious of the coven’s subtle mental warfare. 

When you're constantly enclosed with the same people, distrust fogs the air, twisting logic and bleeding into the back of your mind, planting seeds that were already there, but now they're bigger, leeching onto your thoughts. 

I became convinced Eli was secretly planning to kill me early, when he stopped talking to me, only communicating in one word answers. 

“Are you okay?” I made the two of us coffee, and he poured his down the drain. 

“Yeah.” Eli wouldn't look me in the eye. 

“What's going on?” 

“Nothing.”

“Eli, talk to me.” 

He shrugged, ducking his head. “No.”

I started to lock my door at night, growing fearful of his eyes meeting mine, knowing one spell uttered from his lips would and could kill me. 

I was suddenly far too aware of the silverware on his plate at dinner, his Xbox controller when he was waving it around too much. I saw them as objects. 

Mom forbade magic being used outside of our individual classes, so he could kill me with his bare hands. 

I became paranoid, suffocated with thoughts of Callie and Eli choking me in my sleep, or slicing my throat. 

We were seventeen years old when I became awake and aware of what our coven were doing. 

I almost killed my sister. 

After being driven mad by thoughts of my own demise at the hands of my siblings, I became withdrawn, obsessed with their every movement. 

I sat in my bedroom and stared at four walls, hyper focused on my brother’s footsteps in his room, and the exact weight my sister put into her stride down the stairs. I didn't shower or eat. 

I planned, staying up all night to devise the perfect murder (s). 

I studied my siblings’ every move, finding weak spots and the best place and time to strike. 

With my sister, it had to be heart removal. Callie was a heavy sleeper, and I was sure, if I kept quiet, I could sneak into her room and kill her before she could kill me. 

Eli was different. 

According to Mom, he was the weakest, magic wise. But he towered over the two of us. I settled on slicing his throat. 

It would be quick and easy, and painless.

Mostly painless. 

What I didn't know was that my siblings had the exact same thought. 

I was so obsessed with winning, with surviving, I had no idea the feelings I felt, that paranoia tearing me apart, that thirst to kill, was drowning them too. 
 
*Kill.*

*Before they kill me.*

The night I planned to rip out my sister’s heart, my brother was already hiding behind the door, a steak knife pressed to his chest. 

But Callie was waiting for us, her own knife clenched between her trembling fingers under the blankets. 

Eli struck first with magic he wasn't allowed to use. 

It was a stun spell, sending me staggering back. 

I hit the ground, my vision foggy. Eli was already straddling Callie, teasing the blade into her throat, his teeth gritted. 

I saw red, throwing myself onto his back, wrenching at his hair, my own knife grazing his Adam’s apple. 

I had to win. 

That thought was choking our minds, drowning us. Winning was surviving. 

That's what Mom drilled into us. 

Grappling with our sister, Eli twisted around, already mumbling a spell he only knew half of, which turned my nose purple. 

It was so sudden, so ridiculous, for a disorienting moment, we stopped screaming and yelling at each other. 

Seconds passed. Then a full minute. 

I was gasping for breath, blinking thorough tunnel vision, when my brother burst out laughing. 

The knife slipped from his fingers, and he flopped onto the bed, laughing into a pillow. Actually laughing, the kind of laughter that vibrated his whole body. 

I was caught off guard. 

Mom told me to strike first when they were least expecting us. 

I tried to, but the knife suddenly felt stupid in my hand, like a child's toy. 

That same hysteria slammed into me, and this time it was lukewarm waves pulling me down, enveloping my body. 

Dropping onto my knees, I was overcome with exhaustion, which quickly became almost drunk giggles I couldn't control. 

Callie relaxed, tipping her head back, eyes flickering shut. 

“Mom.” she whispered. 

Eli rolled onto his back, and after standing there hesitantly, I joined the two of them, squashing myself between them. Callie’s bed was warm. 

I forgot what my bed felt like. 

I had been sleeping on the floor for months, terrified of being murdered in my sleep. 

I felt at peace, finally, enough to close my eyes and sleep for the first time in what felt like forever. 

With my brain filled with cotton candy, I dizzily counted the stars on Callie’s ceiling. 

When we were younger, Eli promised us that he would paint the whole room with the galaxy one day, as soon as he got his full powers. Little Eli had no idea what those full powers enquired. 

“Mom is fucking with us,” he mumbled, cutting into my thoughts. 

He was still kind of giddy, so it was more of a sing-song. 

“She told me you guys were acting suspicious, and to protect myself,” Callie hummed, lying in a halo of dark hair. 

Eli scoffed. “Well, she told *me* that I’m the weakest, and I have to watch my back around my powerful sister's.”

“She's trying to turn us against each other,” I said, prodding at my purple nose. 

“So, killing each other will be less of a tragedy and more like a game show. Mom wants to be *entertained*.”

Callie sat up, her eyes wide. “So, she's been–” 

“Brainwashing us.” Eli mumbled into Callie’s pillow. 

Mom almost had us.. 

I almost killed my sister, and then my brother. 

Thankfully, though, we had each other. 

Mom had zero idea we were aware of her attempted manipulation. 

Which made it more fun, I guess.

Mom thought she was playing us, but in reality, we were playing her. 

The three of us gathered as much knowledge on magic, learning both from Mom, and spell books we pulled out of the basement. First, we had to find a charm to break the binding spell. 

Which was harder I thought. 

In secret, we studied and searched for anything that would counteract what was holding us to the house. 

Maybe Mom subconsciously knew we were working against her, because every book containing counter-spells was either destroyed or hidden. 

So, we looked for rituals instead. 

In the meantime, we made sure to act like we were falling apart, arguing in front of Mom, so it looked like she was winning. 

It had to be subtle, so it didn't look forced. 

We stopped talking, shoving each other out of the way. 

We argued over food, over who was emptying the dishwasher, and shower privileges. 

It seemed like normal sibling antics, except the satisfaction on Mom’s face made me sick. 

She was revelling in our hatred for each other. 

Even if it was fake. 

With Mom and the coven none the wiser, we looked further into rituals, mainly ones that required a human sacrifice. 

Blood rituals, bone rituals, anything that *might* free us, we memorised them, and as years went by, my siblings and I planned to escape. 

On the days leading toward our birthday, Mom became visibly paranoid that we were planning to run away. I mean, we were. 

Every time I walked past my brother, I gave him a nod which meant things were still going to plan. 

Eli was in charge of our get-away car. 

Since the outside world was forbidden, we had to get… creative. 

Matthew Stillbrooke, an eighteen year old senior who lived down the block.

There was nothing special about him, except his grandfather's baby blue truck. 

Blood magic was the only way to get Matthew Stillbrooke’s car onto our driveway. 

Mom took away our phones a few months before the ritual, so simply *asking* Matthew was out of the equation. 

Callie is the strongest out of us, so she used transference, which is basically body swapping, but it's done through blood. 

Well aware that Callie casting Transference would wipe us out for at least a day, I knew we had to use it wisely. 

So, we waited until the day before the ritual. Mom was at the grocery store getting food, so we had maybe an hour. 

Callie sat cross legged on her bedroom floor while I held her hand. 

When we were little kids, my sister had mastered transference, easily slipping into the body of a volunteer, and then out again. This was different. 

This was a human, and humans aren't used to magic in their blood.

If Callie fucked up, Matthew was dead, and so were our chances of stealing his truck. 

I can't actually tell you how Callie dealt with the spell, because five minutes in, Eli and I passed out before she could fully bleed into Matthew's body. 

I woke up in bed, maybe six hours later. 

Eli and a drained looking Callie were sitting on my bed. 

All they had to do was smile, for me to know Matthew’s truck was ours. 

Before I could talk to them fully and go over the plan, the coven made a surprise appearance, blessing each of us and wishing us luck, before drugging us. 

However, we were already one thousand steps ahead. 

Eli knew about the sleeping spell, so he had used his last energy to cast a protection spell. 

Which sent us to sleep, but not deep enough to render us helpless. 

Callie woke me up an hour before our twenty second birthday. 

The coven left us sleeping in the lounge, showering us with gifts and messages of good luck. 

I kicked flowers and good luck cards out of the way, dropping onto my knees next to Eli. I was already foggy headed from Callie casting Transference.

Matthew Stillbrooke’s body lay on the floor. 

Callie woke up two hours before us, creeping into his body and bringing him directly into our house. It's not like I wanted to make a human sacrifice, but you need to know, we were trapped. 

Prisoners. 

If there was any spell that didn't take a human life, we would have used it. 

Unfortunately, though, our time was running out. 

It was either draw Matthew's blood from his body, and sever the binding spell, or be caught and forced to brutally kill each other. 

Admittedly, I wanted to make the human sacrifice our mother, though it had to be someone with pure human blood. 

Mom still had Montgomery blood, despite her being human. 

I want to tell you about the blood ritual, but honestly, it feels wrong. 

I will say we said a prayer for the boy, before my brother sliced his throat open. Blood rituals require an entire body. 

We spoke the incantation, and I watched blood run, almost black, across the hardwood floor. 

The ritual required witches to utter the spell until the sacrifice had stopped breathing. 

I remember squeezing my siblings’ hands for dear life, my gaze flicking from the clock on the wall ticking down to midnight, to seeping scarlet dripping from my fingers. 

“Did it work?” Callie whispered, when Matthew's breath stilled. 

Eli lightly felt for a pulse that was no longer there. 

“Uh, yeah,” he said. “I think?”

I don't know what I expected. Maybe to feel like the suffocating weight on my chest had lifted, the invisible chains wrapped around my wrists to fall free. 

I didn't feel any of that. I felt the same. 

It was when I opened our front door and stepped over the threshold, that feeling finally slammed into me. 

The cool graze of night air tickling my face and blowing my hair back. 

The sky was inky oblivion above me, and it was real.

The concrete under my feet, the bug scuttling across my bare arm. 

Real. 

For a moment, I was terrified. 

Twenty one years of my mother’s attempted brainwashing, isolating me from the human world. 

I took a step back, my mind snapping in two, a cry climbing up my throat. 

I wanted to go back inside. 

I wanted to be sheltered from the humans who wanted my powers for themselves. 

But everything I had learned, I learned from the coven and my mother. 

The same people who were grooming my siblings and I into killers. 

I couldn't have jumped into the back of that truck fast enough. 

The seat was warm and cosy, and I pressed my head against the window, allowing myself to breathe. 

Eli took the front seat, and Callie sat in the back with me. 

Our destination was dad’s place in Virginia. Now we had an address. 

Before Mom took our phones away, I took the chance and sent him a friend request, only for him to accept several minutes later, with a message detailing his address and phone number. 

I had them on a sticky note tucked into my jeans. 

Eli started the truck, and with a satisfying grumble of gears, we took off. 

The night looked so beautiful under our birthday moon approaching totality. 

I held the sticky note with dad’s address, clutching between my clammy fingers. 

Samual Lockhart. 

He was human, so we would be safe. 

I wondered what he was like. 

Did he have kids now? Did I have human step siblings? 

I coughed, something warm slipping down my chin.

*Dad would…look after us*.

Outside, blurs of orange danced in the dark. 

I coughed again. 

*Fire*. 

I blinked, thinking it was far away. 

No. 

Figures coming towards us. 

Suddenly, something *physical* contorted my chest and stomach, my body writhing. 

I vomited lumps of thick red pouring from my mouth. 

This wasn't…right. 

I sat up, the sharp movement sending electroshocks down my spine. 

Pressing my face against the window, the blurs of orange were growing brighter. 

I could see them, figures dancing between flickering flames.

I knew it. 

The Montgomery coven were a thousand steps ahead of us. 

“Eli?” I reached for the sticky note, grasping it tightly. 

What my hand found instead was a sticky wetness on the seat. 

I retracted my hand, an explosive cough sending red spraying into my hands. 

In the glow of a passing streetlight, my sister’s head was pressed to the window, a fountain of bulging scarlet spluttering from her mouth, her body jerking. 

Shuffling back, I was already pawing for the lock on the floor. 

We learned of the Crescendo spell as kids. 

Velvet magic is banned in the witch community, but it is still practised in the shadows, and can be easily learned. 

Crescendo was cruel, a subtle death sentence only noticed when it was too late. It could be cast silently, and with one simple word, you can liquidise the body of any living thing. 

I remembered how Mom described it. 

She performed it behind a glass screen, popping the brains of a reptile. 

Little Callie screamed, and I shoved my head under the table. 

Eli started crying. He had already named the frog. 

“Like being dragged through a meat grinder, children,” Mom told us, a scary smile on her face. 

“It is agonizing, and a horrific fate! Only to be used in means such as desperation, or perhaps greed.”

I didn't understand her words until my shaky fingers found the warm wet seeping down my chin. I coughed again. 

This time I couldn't breathe, and that fire, those fucking figures, were closing in on us. *Something is wrong.*  

The words were in my mouth, my hands around our dead sister, who had vomited up her own internal organs, painting the car seat. 

*Something is… wrong*. 

“Eli!” I spoke his name through a spluttered sob, my vision flickering. 

I could feel my brain leaking from my ears in warm rivulets. 

I could feel my body coming apart, Crescendo carving a hole in my soul. 

The truck came to a sputtering stop. I could see my mother’s silhouette outside, her grinning smile. 

I had.. to… stay… *awake.*

I screamed what was supposed to be a debilitating spell back at him. 

Except my mouth wouldn't work, wouldn't form words. 

“Shhh,” Eli murmured, tapping on the wheel.

In the eerie orange glow from outside, I could see my brother’s sly grin.

The bastard really *was* a Montgomery witch. 

“I'm waiting.” Eli tipped his head back, lips twitching into a smirk. His gaze trailed the sky, the moon we were born under. 

“For what?” I shrieked. 

My head hit the window with a *thunk*. 

Outside, our mother stood holding a flaming torch, a proud smile spread across her lips. Through tunnel vision, I saw my brother’s sly grin.

“Midnight.” Eli’s fingers whitened around the wheel. 

I could see that glitter of magic, that purplish hue in his eyes.

*Midnight.*

When, per our mother’s wish, he would tear my power from my soul. 

My gaze found the clock. 

11:56.

I wish I could tell you I secretly knew my brother would betray me. 

That he had been under our mother’s spell since were kids, moulding him into the perfect fucking psychopath. 

But no. If I'm being honest with you, the steak knife tucked into my jeans was in case we were caught. It was a last resort. 

I never thought I would be using it on my own blood. Who wasn't as strong as me. 

As Callie. 

That's why Eli decided *he* was going to take it from us. 

After all, since when was he strong enough to kill two people? 

Callie was dead, and I was sputtering blood. 

My ears were bleeding, and I could taste shapes. 

But I wasn't vomiting my organs. 

11:58.

Two minutes to midnight. 

22 years old. 

I won't say I felt satisfaction when I plunged the blade of my knife into my arm. 

Eli cried out, my pain slamming into him. 

I had minutes. And within those minutes, I decided I wasn't going to take my brother’s life with magic. 

I was aware of him lunging at me, with spells he barely knew, his teeth gritted, foaming from the mouth. 

A simple stun spell sent him falling back. 

I threw myself over the seat, and with him down, with his body paralysed, I delivered the final blow, plunging the knife into his head. 

I felt the crunch of the teeth splitting his skull open, that one brief flash of indescribable agony, before he was gone, and so were his sensation, his feelings, his emotions. 

The bastard died with a smile on his face, which took me off guard. 

Midnight. 

No fireworks. 

No fucking cake. 

I was covered in my siblings’ blood, a full witch. 

Just like all of those before me, every witch who refused to kill for that power. 

I read that you're supposed to feel euphoric, like the power is running through our veins, setting us alight.

It didn't feel like that. 

It felt like the world was crumbling around me. 

My brother’s blood was still warm on my hands, my sister's corpse lying across my knee. 

We were supposed to fucking escape. 

To win. 

I’ve been able to feel them my whole life, their sensations and emotions, all of them. Now I feel nothing, a cavernous oblivion dragging me down. 

When I crawled out of the car, I killed my psycho mother.

I had to, you don't understand. She turned me into a killer. 

She was the monster inside my brother’s head. 

The figures around her body didn't move, didn't speak. They stepped aside. 

They were smiling, their manic eyes drinking me in. 

I didn't know where else to go, so I went to my dad. 

When he opened the door, his eyes were squeezed shut. 

Like he knew one of us was going to come, but he didn't know which one. 

Dad didn't question the blood painting me. His smile melted my heart. 

He was so human, and that's what I needed. 

He led me into his kitchen, threw a blanket around me, and made me hot cocoa. 

Dad brought in a birthday card when I had showered my siblings blood away. 

I tried really hard to not notice that my brother’s name was originally written, and then scribbled out with mine. 

Dear (Eli) Willow!

Happy 22nd birthday! 

Love, 

Dad. 

I knew you could do it, son! (daughter!) Hey, do you mind doing that favor I asked? 

The world feels strange. 

I don't feel like a whole person despite adopting my siblings’ powers. 

When I clench my fist, Eli’s light magic glows between my fingers. 

I should feel excited. 

I should feel that happiness. 

That choking euphoria my mother told me about. 

I don't feel happy, though. 

I feel empty, even as a full witch. I'm terrified of the Montgomery coven. 

They already know where my dad lives. 

No cake.

No fireworks.

Not even a cat. 

Kiki’s Delivery Service lied to me. 

I just have a birthday card addressed to my brother, and magic I never wanted.

Friend and I are both in our late twenties. Im a transplant in our small city and haven’t made a ton of friends since moving here due to health issues. We’ve been good friends for a little over a year and for the most part I love spending time with her, we get along really well and genuinely make each other laugh and can share about our lives. 

Because of my health issues I lost my ability to drive about a year ago. It’s been really tough in a car dependent town, especially being away from all of my friends and family since moving. Everyone in my hometown goes above and beyond for each other, and I doubt I would even notice not having my license there. My friend knows all of this and genuinely hates helping me. I’ve only asked maybe three times in the last year - once was a very quick errand run (I asked ahead of time), twice was asking if she would be willing to go for a quick coffee run when we were already out and about. I don’t think these are big asks, and I’ve always loved getting coffee or running errands with my friends. But when this happens with her you’d think that I was asking her to take me 30 minutes away for some long errand, not a five minute drive to get a latte or a couple groceries. And I’ve only asked three times in a year when we were already out! She gets visibly angry, aggressive, and will even start driving aggressively. 

If she was in my position I would be offering to help her all of the time. I just don’t understand. I want to be her friend but each time this has happened suddenly the thought of seeing her makes my skin crawl for weeks. Am I being too sensitive? I know everyone isn’t perfect but sharing my life and making time for someone who doesn’t want to support me in a very basic way is starting to really wear on me. Any advice appreciated!

*By Your Favorite Sports-Savvy Standup Comedian*

**1. Parse the Odds: A Statistical Tango**  
The numbers here are tighter than a suitcase after a weekend in Marseille. Both teams are priced nearly identically across bookmakers, with Marseille hovering between **+250** (37.5% implied) and **+270** (36.4%) while Lens sits at **+250** (38.5%). The draw? A collective yawn at **+340** (29.4%), which is about as exciting as a referee’s post-match interview.

The key stat? Both teams have the **best defensive records in Ligue 1**, each conceding just seven goals. That’s like having two elite bouncers at a nightclub—no one gets in, but occasionally someone slips through if they’re drunk on ambition (looking at you, Le Havre). Marseille’s offense, though, is a party animal: Mason Greenwood recently scored **four goals in nine minutes** against Le Havre. That’s faster than your Uber driver realizes they’re stuck in traffic.

**2. Digest the News: Green Machine vs. The Unbendables**  
Marseille is riding high on the back of **Mason Greenwood**, who’s turned into a human highlight reel. His four-goal espresso shot against Le Havre? A masterclass in “I’ll just take the entire coffee pot.” The team’s 6-2 win? A statistical anomaly that makes you wonder if Le Havre accidentally showed up to the wrong stadium.

Lens, meanwhile, is the unflappable underdog. Under coach Pierre Sage, they’ve rediscovered their **defensive grit** (a.k.a. “the art of not letting the other team score”). Their 2-1 win over Paris FC? A tactical masterpiece of “we’ll win, but not by much.” And let’s not forget their **0-1 victory in the last meeting**—a psychologica

Here are 10 facts about Ethiopia:

1: It is the country of coffee. Coffee was discovered in this area.

2 : In the Ethiopian calendar, there are 13 months. This means that they are still in 2016 (if you are looking at this in 2025).

3 : A rare African country to have never been colonized (though there was an Italian occupation between 1936 and 1941).

4 : Lucy (an Australopithecus) was discovered in 1974 in Ethiopia.

5 : Ethiopia is mentioned in the Bible and the Quran.

6 : The Great Rift Valley, which cuts Ethiopia in two, is the only land feature visible from the moon.

7 : Ethiopia is one of the countries with the lowest consumption, with 1,850 calories consumed per day.

8 : Ethiopia is the birthplace of Pan-Africanism.

9 : An Ethiopian woman was the first woman to shoot down a fighter jet in the year 2000.

10 : Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II was the first African to drive a car in 1907..

In summary, Ethiopia is a gem for Africa. Between its customs, traditions, and cultures, Ethiopia is truly an important country in Africa.

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved.",1,1761418831.0,HealthyZapper,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Bournemouth vs. Nottingham Forest: A Tale of Two Teams (and Why One Should Probably Pack a Umbrella)**

The Premier League’s upcoming clash between Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest reads like a sitcom premise: *“A rising underdog hosts a team that fires its coach faster than a Netflix password at a family reunion.”* Let’s break this down with the statistical rigor of a spreadsheet and the humor of a sports bar after a few pints.

### Parsing the Odds: Bournemouth’s Implied Probabilities Are About as Surprising as a Sack in a Football Game

The bookmakers aren’t pulling any punches. Bournemouth is the clear favorite at decimal odds of \~1.82 (implied probability: \~55%), while Nottingham Forest sits at 4.2 (\~23.8%), with the draw at \~3.7 (\~27%). To put this in perspective, Forest’s chances of winning are roughly equivalent to me correctly guessing that you spilled coffee on your shirt this morning. Bournemouth’s implied probability suggests they’re twice as likely to win as Forest is to even *tie*.

The spread favors Bournemouth (-0.5) at \~1.8 odds, meaning bookies expect them to win outright. Meanwhile, the total goals line sits at 2.5, with “Over” and “Under” hovering near even money. Given Bournemouth’s 14-goal frenzy in their last seven games (and Forest’s porous defense, which leaks goals like a sieve at a water park), the “Over” feels like a safe bet unless both teams decide to play chess on the pitch.

### Team News: Forest’s Managerial Carousel and Bournemouth’s “Almost There” Syndrome

Bournemouth, third in the league with 15 points from eight games, has been a revelation under Andoni Iraola. They’ve lost just once—a 4-2 slip-up against Liverpool—and their attack is as prolific as a baker’s oven. However, their 3-3 draw with Crystal Palace last time out proved they’re not immune to late collapses. Imagine a team that’s *almost* great—like a Netflix series that’s *almost* good enough to finish in one sitting.

Nottingham Forest, meanwhile, is a case study in chaos. They’re winless in seven league games and 18th in the table, with a managerial saga that would make Shakespeare weep. Ange Postecoglou’s 39-day tenure ended as dramatically as a soap opera finale, and new boss Sea

We matched about a month ago and since we’re both still in HS (I’m 19 and she’s 18) I randomly went to her school, which she was okay with and I hung out with her and her friend for HOURS. 
We went on an actual date without her friend ofc 2 days after and we both had so much fun; we walked around the city, talked, hugged a lot and held hands which was a cherry on top. 

Today we met up again and went to a bookstore and a coffee shop and got to know each other even more. We also talked about what we expected from each other and we both agreed on something short term but still exclusive because of our education. I’m about to start a pilot program and I’m gonna get a part time job to pay for it so it wouldn’t be the best time for a serious relationship and she’s going to move to Ireland once she graduates, so we were both really glad that we were on the same page.

Anyways, by the end of the date we hugged but I instinctively went in to hug her because that’s what we always do when we part ways, but I noticed that she kinda raised her hand to cup my cheek but my dumbass just hugged her 😭. after the hug she actually cupped my cheek and looked at me for a bit before kissing me.

I’m not picky about the exact design and would love to see any creative ideas. A short, bold, elegant main title like “ATLAS” or “VOYAGE” could work, with some subtle subtext evoking coffee plantations, open roads, early mornings, dense jungles, or adventure on two wheels. Fonts and typography could be clean, elegant, and cinematic, like a high-end travel magazine. Any image works really, I uploaded a couple for more options. Thank you very much!

Yeah… so.  
There was this guy, let’s call him AZ.  
For almost a year, he’d pick me up after work. Never asked for anything. Just… wanted to be near me. Bring me coffee. Listen. Pay for dinner. Send little things just because.

I never promised him more than my presence. And he was okay with that. Said serving me made him feel… grounded.  

Then last month, he told me he’s getting married. To someone he’s known since college. A good girl. Sweet, kind, doesn’t even know he has this side.  

And you know what I did?  
I told him: “Congratulations. Now disappear.”

No drama. No guilt. No “just one last time.”  
I blocked his payment apps. Ignored his “just checking in” texts.  

Because real respect isn’t just about how you treat me, it’s about how you honor the life you’ve chosen. And I won’t be the secret that stains his future wife’s trust.  

It hurts a little, honestly. Not because I loved him, but because loyalty like that? It’s rare.  

But I’d rather be alone than complicit.  

Anyway… just needed to say it out loud.  
Some of you might think I’m naive. But I’d rather lose a sub than lose my integrity.

He is confident, gentle, and had this teasing, audacious sense of humour. Our sessions were always relaxed and full of banter. He’d also text me after everysessions to ask how I was doing. I was comfortable with him since we have a common friend but I don’t want anything more because we’re both happily taken.

After 2 sessions, things got a bit… ambiguous. He started to seem physically more comfortable: touching my hair, holding eye contact, joking “je suis amoureux” (“I’m in love”). He joked that I can be back just for a coffee or that we can come to climbing room together (idk if it’s just a joke or not since he laughed it off directly, so I just say yes in the moment but he never actually insist or send out real invitation). When we said goodbye after sessions: from nothing, to cheek-to-cheek bises French way -> lips-to-cheek -> then a real smooche paired with a hug.

Since the smooche, I’ve set a small boundary to keep things clear (didn’t want it to feel inappropriate). Now he’s still friendly, teasing around but sometimes his answers would turn cold and disengaged all of sudden.

I’m not trying to pursue anything. I’m just curious: based on this, do you think he was flirting vs me, or was he just a naturally warm, teasing guy who meant nothing deeper?

I eat the same thing everyday and it only changes either weekly when I go grocery shopping OR the few times a week where I grab a coffee/go out to eat. 

It feels like a chore to plug the same foods in every single day. I started wishing that there was something where I could just hit a button and check off that I ate my meal....but still had flexibility to change things around when I needed too. 

So...given that I'm a comp sci student in her senior year, I started developing the solution to my problem! 

We are all so busy with everything that goes on in our lives and I think there needs to be a calorie tracking app that doesn't make it feel like an additional task we have to do.

I also would like to add an AI component to allow users to choose meals that fit their calorie/macro goals if they are going out to eat.

Currently, we are finishing up the website and of course are planning to drop an app version as well.

A steel dawn barely broke through the dense, leaden clouds hanging over the Mongolian steppe. An icy wind whipped across the open expanse of the hand-to-hand combat training ground, carrying flurries of snow and dust. The atmosphere, however, was different than a week earlier. Another company of Guardsmen stood on the field—this time, they weren't greenhorns fresh from basic sniper training, but battle-hardened candidates for future hand-to-hand combat instructors. All had undergone nanite treatment years ago, and some of them were veterans who had fought in Beijing.

They knew what awaited them. They had also seen the fear in the eyes of the recruits who watched the session, standing around the training ground.

Today, however, the roles were reversed. It was they, the future teachers of survival in close combat, who were to face the being that was the living embodiment of the enemy. This was an experiment—involving Otto was intended to train the first cadre of instructors who would pass this painful knowledge on.

At the center of attention, towering over the humans in height and mass, stood Otto. Just three days ago, he himself had undergone a transformation—as the first representative of his species, he had received the gift, or perhaps the curse, of nanites. The procedure was risky. Permission to perform it had been negotiated personally by Admiral Marcus Thorne, appealing directly to the Swarm. The aliens had agreed, reprogramming a single dose specifically for Otto. It was a test—the Swarm knew that if Otto's intentions were not sincere, if his desire to fight his brethren was false, the nanites would kill him. But Otto survived. His thirst for revenge for the death of his human caregiver, his adoptive mother, who had died during the invasion and bombing of the world's cities, proved stronger than biological barriers.

The Swarm's nanites accepted him, making him an even more powerful being. Although he looked the same on the outside—the machines had halted his aging, but not reversed time—he felt new power pulsing through his veins, faster regeneration, and sharpened senses.

He now stood on the field as a victor. For the past two hours, he had been methodically ""processing"" one candidate after another. The scenario was repetitive: a Guardsman in Hoplite 2.0 powered armor, armed with a heavy training bayonet, would charge. Otto, clad only in form-fitting combat armor without augmentation, moved with a fluidity and speed that seemed impossible for a being of his size. He dodged blows, parried, countered. His movements were economical, brutally effective. From time to time, he allowed a bayonet to glance off his scales, striking a shower of sparks—a sign that the blow was strong and accurate, but still insufficient.

Out of more than sixty future instructors who took up the challenge, only five managed to achieve this minimal success. Five out of sixty battle-hardened Guardsmen, supported by nanotechnology. If this had been a real fight, if Otto had been using his claws, and his goal had been to kill rather than teach—the win-loss ratio would have been crushing. A massacre in the Plague's favor.

At the edge of the field, Colonel Kent watched the entire session in silence. His face, marked by the old battle in the ruins of Beijing, was inscrutable. He saw in Otto's movements an echo of Goth'roh—another Plague warrior whom he had defeated only by blind luck. He saw the same strength, the same speed, the same ruthless efficiency.

When the last of the defeated candidates stumbled to his feet, Kent finally spoke. His voice, amplified by the communicator, was calm but carried the weight of experience and bitter truth.

""Thank Otto for this lesson,"" he addressed the breathless, bruised Guardsmen.

""Each of you will be teaching hand-to-hand combat to future recruits and cadets of the Guard. The result of today's exercise should give you pause.""

He paused, his gaze sweeping over their faces, then resting on Otto.

""The conclusion is simple: hand-to-hand combat with a representative of the Plague race is a last resort. Almost every such engagement means the death of a Guardsman, even in Hoplite 2.0 powered armor. Their strength and endurance are at a level we cannot achieve.""

He looked again at the Guardsmen and the observing recruits, and a shadow of pain and humility appeared in his eyes.

""My victory over Goth'roh, their commander in Beijing, was pure chance. A fluke, nothing more. Standing here before you, I am a dead man walking, living on borrowed time. Remember that. Teach it to your charges. In a one-on-one fight with them, distance is your only ally. Up close... up close, you are just meat. Meat they can process very quickly.""

Days and weeks passed this way. Otto's life turned into a repetitive, albeit intense, cycle. From one training base to another. A private military shuttle became his second home—transport to a new facility, a few days of brutal exercises with another company of future instructors, and then travel again. Each group was different, but the goal remained the same: to instill in them the painful truth about melee combat with the Plague, about their own fragility even in powerful augmented armor. Otto became a living, scaled educational tool, a hammer forging the Guard's new doctrine.

However, in the world of United Earth, even in the shadow of the omnipresent Guard and the specter of the coming war, certain mechanisms of the old world still functioned. Freedom of the press and media, though limited and often managed, existed. Information, even the most inconvenient, had a tendency to leak. Rumors of a ""reptile in a Guard uniform,"" initially treated as absurd barracks tales, began to take shape. Investigative journalists, sensing the scoop of the decade, quickly delved into the topic, using their sources within the Guard, analyzing vague mentions in official communiques, and piecing together scraps of information. The pressure grew. The truth about the existence of Otto, a Guardsman of the Plague race fighting for humanity, was becoming an open secret, threatening an uncontrolled explosion of panic or disinformation.

After several weeks of growing media buzz, a decision was made in the highest circles of Guard Command. Instead of denying or remaining silent, which would only fuel speculation, they decided to confirm Otto's existence—but on their own terms. A controlled leak was planned, a carefully staged, supposedly spontaneous incident intended to present Otto in the proper light. The location chosen was the bustling international suborbital shuttle port in Kinshasa, the capital of the Republic of Congo. The scenario was simple. Otto, on his way to another base, would be ""accidentally"" spotted and ""mobbed"" by journalists.

Otto walked through the crowded port terminal. The vast hall, gleaming with chrome and glass, pulsed with life—a mix of languages, cultures, and smells. He ignored the curious glances that his over-two-meter-tall, reptilian figure inevitably attracted, even here in this cosmopolitan melting pot. A military duffel bag slung nonchalantly over his shoulder and the small contingent of Guardsmen accompanying him—familiar faces, soldiers he had already worked with on the training grounds—were meant to lend him an aura of normalcy, as much as that was possible.

Suddenly, the din subsided. As if on command, hundreds of people froze mid-step, mid-word. They stared at him. In this unnatural silence, the clatter of boots and shouting erupted. Journalists emerged from the crowd. Flashes popped, microphones thrust towards him like aggressive tentacles. Otto's security detail, as planned, formed a loose cordon, not completely blocking access but ensuring a minimum of space.

Questions rained down, but they were the ones agreed upon beforehand, fed to ""sources"" as a ""leak"":

""Is it true you're a Guardsman? Do you serve in the Seven Worlds Defense Guard?""

""There are reports you've undergone nanite treatment. Did the Swarm consent to this and support you in the process?""

""Who are you? Where are you from? There are rumors you were raised among humans... How did you end up on Earth?""

Everything was meant to look natural, chaotic. Otto, aware of the cameras recording his every move, every grimace, played his part perfectly. He stopped, raised his scaled brows slightly in a gesture of feigned surprise. He smiled—but it was a controlled smile, barely a lift at the corners of his mouth, without showing the row of sharp teeth that might terrify viewers. In a calm, deep voice, which he had learned to modulate to sound less alien, he began to answer selected questions, skillfully dodging the most sensitive ones, citing military secrecy or the good of the investigation into his origins. He confirmed his service in the Guard, the Swarm's support for his nanite treatment, and the fact he was raised by humans. His words, carefully chosen, were meant to build the image of a loyal ally, a being who had chosen humanity, rejecting his heritage.

The news went global. Within an hour, Otto became the most searched term on the global network. The image of the reptilian Guardsman flooded screens, evoking a mixture of shock, disbelief, fear, but also—as planned—fascination and hope. The propaganda had worked. The monster had been tamed, put in a uniform, and presented as further proof of United Earth's strength and unity in the face of the cosmic threat.

The controlled leak worked, but the image of Otto—a representative of the race responsible for millions of deaths—in a Guard uniform evoked more than just fascination. From the dark corners of the global network and the anonymity of comment sections, a wave of hatred poured out. Threats appeared. Some saw Otto as a Trojan horse, a Plague spy in the very heart of the human war machine. Others, consumed by xenophobic fear, could not accept an ""alien"" in the role of a defender. Humanity showed its ugly side—fear of the unknown, ease of judgment, deep-seated distrust.

Guard Command, monitoring these reactions, realized that the mere information of Otto's existence was not enough. To give humanity and the media time to digest this shocking news, and above all, to steer the narrative in a more desirable direction, they decided to go a step further. The decision was made to reveal the truth about Otto's origin—and about the existence of sixteen other, young representatives of his race who were also in the Guard's care.

Another controlled communique, this time more formal but infused with a carefully selected emotional charge, was sent to the media. It was revealed that Otto was not an ""ordinary"" member of the Plague. He was a clone, created in a secret, underground research facility. He was presented as an innocent child, a victim of brutal experiments conducted by an isolated, fanatical, criminal faction of Guard scientists. It was emphasized that Admiral Marcus Thorne, as soon as he learned of the facility's existence and the research being conducted there, without knowing its full scope, immediately took decisive action to put an end to it and free Otto and the other clones.

Of course, the official version omitted the bloody details—there was no mention of the scientists' execution, of the shots to the head administered by the admiral himself. The story was carefully sanitized to present Thorne as a righteous savior and Otto as a victim who, despite his trauma, chose to fight alongside his liberators.

This new narrative was intended to evoke sympathy, to replace fear with pity and admiration for a being who had gone through hell and still stood on the side of good. Otto, from a potential threat, was to become a symbol of hope.

The next step in the carefully planned campaign to soften Otto's image was an appearance on United Earth's most popular morning talk show—""Couch Morning with the Global Information Network."" The program, known for its relaxed atmosphere, light topics, and the hosts' ever-present smiles, was the perfect place to introduce the ""tamed"" monster to the general public. The studio gleamed with bright colors, comfortable sofas invited casual conversation, and the smell of brewing coffee mingled with the aroma of dishes being prepared in the kitchenette—an essential element of any self-respecting morning show.

The special guests that day were Colonel Kent and, to the astonishment of millions of viewers, Otto himself. Kent, in civilian clothes, looked slightly tense but tried to remain casual. Otto, also out of uniform, wearing a simple dark turtleneck that emphasized his otherworldly, though still reptilian, build, sat on the couch with almost inhuman calm, observing his surroundings with his yellow, vertical pupils.

The host, smiling from ear to ear, began with questions for Kent. The Colonel spoke about Otto's role in training future Guard instructors. He emphasized that although the methods were brutal, every lesson taught by Otto, every clash on the training ground, potentially saved the future lives of Guardsmen on the battlefield. ""He shows them the truth,"" Kent said, looking into the camera. ""The truth about what they will have to face. It's better to learn it under controlled conditions than when lives are at stake.""

To the production's surprise, Kent, when asked about his own, now legendary, confrontation with the Plague commander in Beijing, admitted bluntly: ""My victory over Goth'roh? Pure chance. He stumbled at the last second and impaled himself on my bayonet. I just got damn lucky."" This honesty, so atypical for a military hero, charmed the viewers. Kent never hid the truth; he always spoke openly about it to anyone who asked.

Then came the culinary segment. The sight of Otto, standing at a kitchen counter next to Kent and a smiling, aproned cook, was surreal. When asked about his favorite foods, Otto, after a moment's thought, replied in his deep, slightly rough voice: ""Steak. Wrapped in bacon. With barbecue sauce. And... pickled cucumbers.""

Kent, laughing, added: ""And me? I love Italian food. Give me a good pizza or pasta, and I'll be happy.""

The image of Otto, clumsily but with full concentration, trying to wrap a steak in bacon slices under the watchful eye of the camera, immediately went viral. Hundreds of memes, jokes, and short clips were created. ""Otto at the stove,"" ""MasterChef: Interstellar Edition,"" ""Pickled cucumber—the Guard's secret weapon."" Humor, as always, proved to be the best tool for defusing tension. Otto's image, previously associated exclusively with threat and war, gained a human (or rather, ""humanized"") dimension.

These carefully planned PR efforts achieved their intended effect. The wave of hatred online did not disappear entirely, but it was overshadowed by a wave of curiosity, humor, and even a strange sort of sympathy. Otto, the clone-victim, the Guardsman-cook, became a more complex, less unambiguous figure. Humanity, though still full of apprehension, began to accept his presence.

After several weeks of the media storm and carefully arranged appearances, it was time for the next, risky step. Otto was given permission to go out on the street. It wasn't complete freedom—he knew that somewhere in the crowd, in parked cars, on rooftops, Guard agents in civilian clothes were watching, ready to react to the slightest incident. Nevertheless, for Otto, raised in isolation, the very possibility of stepping outside the sterile walls of a base or a television studio was a breath of freedom he had never experienced before. The ""test"" location chosen was New Delhi—a gigantic metropolis, Earth's second-largest industrial center, teeming with life, chaotic, culturally diverse. Perfect for blending into a crowd while simultaneously testing people's reactions in a less controlled environment.

When Otto stepped out of the autonomous taxi onto one of the busy shopping streets, a momentary silence fell. The hubbub of conversations, honking horns, and vendors' calls—everything ceased as people turned their attention to him. His tall, reptilian figure was impossible to miss. A few isolated, hostile shouts and insults were hurled from the crowd, from a safe distance. Otto tensed for a split second, instinctively bracing his muscles, ready for the attack he had been expecting since the day his existence became public. But no one moved. No one threw a stone, no one tried to attack him. After a moment of silence, the noise slowly returned, though now it was laced with whispers and nervous glances. Success. The first hurdle was cleared.

He headed towards a large grocery store, trying to move calmly, naturally. He felt dozens, hundreds of eyes on him. People watched him with a mixture of fear, curiosity, and fascination. He saw the flashes of smartphones—they were taking pictures, recording videos. A few people, mostly young, dared to approach, shyly asking for a selfie. Otto, instructed by the PR specialists, nodded, trying to adopt a neutral expression (which, given his reptilian physiology, was not easy). He posed for a moment, feeling like a zoo exhibit, but at the same time... for the first time, he didn't feel like a target.

Inside the grocery store, it was much the same. Bright lights, rows of shelves groaning under the weight of goods from all over the world, a cacophony of smells. Everyone was watching him. Whispers followed him as he walked between the aisles. He focused on his shopping list—his favorite beef steaks, thick-cut bacon. He loaded them into his cart in quantities that would seem absurd for a single human, but were normal for his metabolism. He tried to ignore the onlookers, to concentrate on the simple, everyday task. And surprisingly, it worked. Choosing meat, comparing barbecue sauce prices—these mundane tasks became an anchor in a sea of strangeness. For Otto, this was one of the first days in his short life, marked by isolation and combat, that he could consider close to normal.

At the checkout, the clerk, a young Indian man with curious eyes, glanced at the contents of the cart and then at Otto. A wide, slightly surprised smile spread across his face.

""You can really eat!"" he said in fluent English. ""Ten kilos of steak and bacon! Quite an appetite!""

Otto smiled slightly, again without showing his teeth. ""Well, I like to eat.""

""Have you tried our Rogan Josh?"" the cashier asked, pointing to a shelf of ready-made meals. ""Lamb curry, a specialty from Kashmir. Delicious!""

Otto looked at the colorful package. Indian cuisine was completely foreign to him. ""I'm not that good of a cook,"" he admitted.

""We have a ready-made product in our selection! I buy it myself, I recommend it,"" the employee encouraged. ""You just have to heat it up. Give it a try, you'll definitely like it.""

Otto hesitated for a moment. Then he nodded. ""You know what? I'll try it.""

He paid for his groceries and packed them into bags. As he left the store, he again felt the stares, but now they seemed less intrusive, more accustomed. He stood on the sidewalk for a moment, squinting in the sun. The noise of the street, the smells of food, the crowd of people—it all suddenly seemed... normal. It was the first day of his new, normal life.

Chapter 5: Otto and the Steak.

Earth, January 26, 2150.

A steel dawn barely broke through the dense, leaden clouds hanging over the Mongolian steppe. An icy wind whipped across the open expanse of the hand-to-hand combat training ground, carrying flurries of snow and dust. The atmosphere, however, was different than a week earlier. Another company of Guardsmen stood on the field—this time, they weren't greenhorns fresh from basic sniper training, but battle-hardened candidates for future hand-to-hand combat instructors. All had undergone nanite treatment years ago, and some of them were veterans who had fought in Beijing.

They knew what awaited them. They had also seen the fear in the eyes of the recruits who watched the session, standing around the training ground.

Today, however, the roles were reversed. It was they, the future teachers of survival in close combat, who were to face the being that was the living embodiment of the enemy. This was an experiment—involving Otto was intended to train the first cadre of instructors who would pass this painful knowledge on.

At the center of attention, towering over the humans in height and mass, stood Otto. Just three days ago, he himself had undergone a transformation—as the first representative of his species, he had received the gift, or perhaps the curse, of nanites. The procedure was risky. Permission to perform it had been negotiated personally by Admiral Marcus Thorne, appealing directly to the Swarm. The aliens had agreed, reprogramming a single dose specifically for Otto. It was a test—the Swarm knew that if Otto's intentions were not sincere, if his desire to fight his brethren was false, the nanites would kill him. But Otto survived. His thirst for revenge for the death of his human caregiver, his adoptive mother, who had died during the invasion and bombing of the world's cities, proved stronger than biological barriers.

The Swarm's nanites accepted him, making him an even more powerful being. Although he looked the same on the outside—the machines had halted his aging, but not reversed time—he felt new power pulsing through his veins, faster regeneration, and sharpened senses.

He now stood on the field as a victor. For the past two hours, he had been methodically ""processing"" one candidate after another. The scenario was repetitive: a Guardsman in Hoplite 2.0 powered armor, armed with a heavy training bayonet, would charge. Otto, clad only in form-fitting combat armor without augmentation, moved with a fluidity and speed that seemed impossible for a being of his size. He dodged blows, parried, countered. His movements were economical, brutally effective. From time to time, he allowed a bayonet to glance off his scales, striking a shower of sparks—a sign that the blow was strong and accurate, but still insufficient.

Out of more than sixty future instructors who took up the challenge, only five managed to achieve this minimal success. Five out of sixty battle-hardened Guardsmen, supported by nanotechnology. If this had been a real fight, if Otto had been using his claws, and his goal had been to kill rather than teach—the win-loss ratio would have been crushing. A massacre in the Plague's favor.

At the edge of the field, Colonel Kent watched the entire session in silence. His face, marked by the old battle in the ruins of Beijing, was inscrutable. He saw in Otto's movements an echo of Goth'roh—another Plague warrior whom he had defeated only by blind luck. He saw the same strength, the same speed, the same ruthless efficiency.

When the last of the defeated candidates stumbled to his feet, Kent finally spoke. His voice, amplified by the communicator, was calm but carried the weight of experience and bitter truth.

""Thank Otto for this lesson,"" he addressed the breathless, bruised Guardsmen.

""Each of you will be teaching hand-to-hand combat to future recruits and cadets of the Guard. The result of today's exercise should give you pause.""

He paused, his gaze sweeping over their faces, then resting on Otto.

""The conclusion is simple: hand-to-hand combat with a representative of the Plague race is a last resort. Almost every such engagement means the death of a Guardsman, even in Hoplite 2.0 powered armor. Their strength and endurance are at a level we cannot achieve.""

He looked again at the Guardsmen and the observing recruits, and a shadow of pain and humility appeared in his eyes.

""My victory over Goth'roh, their commander in Beijing, was pure chance. A fluke, nothing more. Standing here before you, I am a dead man walking, living on borrowed time. Remember that. Teach it to your charges. In a one-on-one fight with them, distance is your only ally. Up close... up close, you are just meat. Meat they can process very quickly.""

Days and weeks passed this way. Otto's life turned into a repetitive, albeit intense, cycle. From one training base to another. A private military shuttle became his second home—transport to a new facility, a few days of brutal exercises with another company of future instructors, and then travel again. Each group was different, but the goal remained the same: to instill in them the painful truth about melee combat with the Plague, about their own fragility even in powerful augmented armor. Otto became a living, scaled educational tool, a hammer forging the Guard's new doctrine.

However, in the world of United Earth, even in the shadow of the omnipresent Guard and the specter of the coming war, certain mechanisms of the old world still functioned. Freedom of the press and media, though limited and often managed, existed. Information, even the most inconvenient, had a tendency to leak. Rumors of a ""reptile in a Guard uniform,"" initially treated as absurd barracks tales, began to take shape. Investigative journalists, sensing the scoop of the decade, quickly delved into the topic, using their sources within the Guard, analyzing vague mentions in official communiques, and piecing together scraps of information. The pressure grew. The truth about the existence of Otto, a Guardsman of the Plague race fighting for humanity, was becoming an open secret, threatening an uncontrolled explosion of panic or disinformation.

After several weeks of growing media buzz, a decision was made in the highest circles of Guard Command. Instead of denying or remaining silent, which would only fuel speculation, they decided to confirm Otto's existence—but on their own terms. A controlled leak was planned, a carefully staged, supposedly spontaneous incident intended to present Otto in the proper light. The location chosen was the bustling international suborbital shuttle port in Kinshasa, the capital of the Republic of Congo. The scenario was simple. Otto, on his way to another base, would be ""accidentally"" spotted and ""mobbed"" by journalists.

Otto walked through the crowded port terminal. The vast hall, gleaming with chrome and glass, pulsed with life—a mix of languages, cultures, and smells. He ignored the curious glances that his over-two-meter-tall, reptilian figure inevitably attracted, even here in this cosmopolitan melting pot. A military duffel bag slung nonchalantly over his shoulder and the small contingent of Guardsmen accompanying him—familiar faces, soldiers he had already worked with on the training grounds—were meant to lend him an aura of normalcy, as much as that was possible.

Suddenly, the din subsided. As if on command, hundreds of people froze mid-step, mid-word. They stared at him. In this unnatural silence, the clatter of boots and shouting erupted. Journalists emerged from the crowd. Flashes popped, microphones thrust towards him like aggressive tentacles. Otto's security detail, as planned, formed a loose cordon, not completely blocking access but ensuring a minimum of space.

Questions rained down, but they were the ones agreed upon beforehand, fed to ""sources"" as a ""leak"":

""Is it true you're a Guardsman? Do you serve in the Seven Worlds Defense Guard?""

""There are reports you've undergone nanite treatment. Did the Swarm consent to this and support you in the process?""

""Who are you? Where are you from? There are rumors you were raised among humans... How did you end up on Earth?""

Everything was meant to look natural, chaotic. Otto, aware of the cameras recording his every move, every grimace, played his part perfectly. He stopped, raised his scaled brows slightly in a gesture of feigned surprise. He smiled—but it was a controlled smile, barely a lift at the corners of his mouth, without showing the row of sharp teeth that might terrify viewers. In a calm, deep voice, which he had learned to modulate to sound less alien, he began to answer selected questions, skillfully dodging the most sensitive ones, citing military secrecy or the good of the investigation into his origins. He confirmed his service in the Guard, the Swarm's support for his nanite treatment, and the fact he was raised by humans. His words, carefully chosen, were meant to build the image of a loyal ally, a being who had chosen humanity, rejecting his heritage.

The news went global. Within an hour, Otto became the most searched term on the global network. The image of the reptilian Guardsman flooded screens, evoking a mixture of shock, disbelief, fear, but also—as planned—fascination and hope. The propaganda had worked. The monster had been tamed, put in a uniform, and presented as further proof of United Earth's strength and unity in the face of the cosmic threat.

The controlled leak worked, but the image of Otto—a representative of the race responsible for millions of deaths—in a Guard uniform evoked more than just fascination. From the dark corners of the global network and the anonymity of comment sections, a wave of hatred poured out. Threats appeared. Some saw Otto as a Trojan horse, a Plague spy in the very heart of the human war machine. Others, consumed by xenophobic fear, could not accept an ""alien"" in the role of a defender. Humanity showed its ugly side—fear of the unknown, ease of judgment, deep-seated distrust.

Guard Command, monitoring these reactions, realized that the mere information of Otto's existence was not enough. To give humanity and the media time to digest this shocking news, and above all, to steer the narrative in a more desirable direction, they decided to go a step further. The decision was made to reveal the truth about Otto's origin—and about the existence of sixteen other, young representatives of his race who were also in the Guard's care.

Another controlled communique, this time more formal but infused with a carefully selected emotional charge, was sent to the media. It was revealed that Otto was not an ""ordinary"" member of the Plague. He was a clone, created in a secret, underground research facility. He was presented as an innocent child, a victim of brutal experiments conducted by an isolated, fanatical, criminal faction of Guard scientists. It was emphasized that Admiral Marcus Thorne, as soon as he learned of the facility's existence and the research being conducted there, without knowing its full scope, immediately took decisive action to put an end to it and free Otto and the other clones.

Of course, the official version omitted the bloody details—there was no mention of the scientists' execution, of the shots to the head administered by the admiral himself. The story was carefully sanitized to present Thorne as a righteous savior and Otto as a victim who, despite his trauma, chose to fight alongside his liberators.

This new narrative was intended to evoke sympathy, to replace fear with pity and admiration for a being who had gone through hell and still stood on the side of good. Otto, from a potential threat, was to become a symbol of hope.

The next step in the carefully planned campaign to soften Otto's image was an appearance on United Earth's most popular morning talk show—""Couch Morning with the Global Information Network."" The program, known for its relaxed atmosphere, light topics, and the hosts' ever-present smiles, was the perfect place to introduce the ""tamed"" monster to the general public. The studio gleamed with bright colors, comfortable sofas invited casual conversation, and the smell of brewing coffee mingled with the aroma of dishes being prepared in the kitchenette—an essential element of any self-respecting morning show.

The special guests that day were Colonel Kent and, to the astonishment of millions of viewers, Otto himself. Kent, in civilian clothes, looked slightly tense but tried to remain casual. Otto, also out of uniform, wearing a simple dark turtleneck that emphasized his otherworldly, though still reptilian, build, sat on the couch with almost inhuman calm, observing his surroundings with his yellow, vertical pupils.

The host, smiling from ear to ear, began with questions for Kent. The Colonel spoke about Otto's role in training future Guard instructors. He emphasized that although the methods were brutal, every lesson taught by Otto, every clash on the training ground, potentially saved the future lives of Guardsmen on the battlefield. ""He shows them the truth,"" Kent said, looking into the camera. ""The truth about what they will have to face. It's better to learn it under controlled conditions than when lives are at stake.""

To the production's surprise, Kent, when asked about his own, now legendary, confrontation with the Plague commander in Beijing, admitted bluntly: ""My victory over Goth'roh? Pure chance. He stumbled at the last second and impaled himself on my bayonet. I just got damn lucky."" This honesty, so atypical for a military hero, charmed the viewers. Kent never hid the truth; he always spoke openly about it to anyone who asked.

Then came the culinary segment. The sight of Otto, standing at a kitchen counter next to Kent and a smiling, aproned cook, was surreal. When asked about his favorite foods, Otto, after a moment's thought, replied in his deep, slightly rough voice: ""Steak. Wrapped in bacon. With barbecue sauce. And... pickled cucumbers.""

Kent, laughing, added: ""And me? I love Italian food. Give me a good pizza or pasta, and I'll be happy.""

The image of Otto, clumsily but with full concentration, trying to wrap a steak in bacon slices under the watchful eye of the camera, immediately went viral. Hundreds of memes, jokes, and short clips were created. ""Otto at the stove,"" ""MasterChef: Interstellar Edition,"" ""Pickled cucumber—the Guard's secret weapon."" Humor, as always, proved to be the best tool for defusing tension. Otto's image, previously associated exclusively with threat and war, gained a human (or rather, ""humanized"") dimension.

These carefully planned PR efforts achieved their intended effect. The wave of hatred online did not disappear entirely, but it was overshadowed by a wave of curiosity, humor, and even a strange sort of sympathy. Otto, the clone-victim, the Guardsman-cook, became a more complex, less unambiguous figure. Humanity, though still full of apprehension, began to accept his presence.

After several weeks of the media storm and carefully arranged appearances, it was time for the next, risky step. Otto was given permission to go out on the street. It wasn't complete freedom—he knew that somewhere in the crowd, in parked cars, on rooftops, Guard agents in civilian clothes were watching, ready to react to the slightest incident. Nevertheless, for Otto, raised in isolation, the very possibility of stepping outside the sterile walls of a base or a television studio was a breath of freedom he had never experienced before. The ""test"" location chosen was New Delhi—a gigantic metropolis, Earth's second-largest industrial center, teeming with life, chaotic, culturally diverse. Perfect for blending into a crowd while simultaneously testing people's reactions in a less controlled environment.

When Otto stepped out of the autonomous taxi onto one of the busy shopping streets, a momentary silence fell. The hubbub of conversations, honking horns, and vendors' calls—everything ceased as people turned their attention to him. His tall, reptilian figure was impossible to miss. A few isolated, hostile shouts and insults were hurled from the crowd, from a safe distance. Otto tensed for a split second, instinctively bracing his muscles, ready for the attack he had been expecting since the day his existence became public. But no one moved. No one threw a stone, no one tried to attack him. After a moment of silence, the noise slowly returned, though now it was laced with whispers and nervous glances. Success. The first hurdle was cleared.

He headed towards a large grocery store, trying to move calmly, naturally. He felt dozens, hundreds of eyes on him. People watched him with a mixture of fear, curiosity, and fascination. He saw the flashes of smartphones—they were taking pictures, recording videos. A few people, mostly young, dared to approach, shyly asking for a selfie. Otto, instructed by the PR specialists, nodded, trying to adopt a neutral expression (which, given his reptilian physiology, was not easy). He posed for a moment, feeling like a zoo exhibit, but at the same time... for the first time, he didn't feel like a target.

Inside the grocery store, it was much the same. Bright lights, rows of shelves groaning under the weight of goods from all over the world, a cacophony of smells. Everyone was watching him. Whispers followed him as he walked between the aisles. He focused on his shopping list—his favorite beef steaks, thick-cut bacon. He loaded them into his cart in quantities that would seem absurd for a single human, but were normal for his metabolism. He tried to ignore the onlookers, to concentrate on the simple, everyday task. And surprisingly, it worked. Choosing meat, comparing barbecue sauce prices—these mundane tasks became an anchor in a sea of strangeness. For Otto, this was one of the first days in his short life, marked by isolation and combat, that he could consider close to normal.

At the checkout, the clerk, a young Indian man with curious eyes, glanced at the contents of the cart and then at Otto. A wide, slightly surprised smile spread across his face.

""You can really eat!"" he said in fluent English. ""Ten kilos of steak and bacon! Quite an appetite!""

Otto smiled slightly, again without showing his teeth. ""Well, I like to eat.""

""Have you tried our Rogan Josh?"" the cashier asked, pointing to a shelf of ready-made meals. ""Lamb curry, a specialty from Kashmir. Delicious!""

Otto looked at the colorful package. Indian cuisine was completely foreign to him. ""I'm not that good of a cook,"" he admitted.

""We have a ready-made product in our selection! I buy it myself, I recommend it,"" the employee encouraged. ""You just have to heat it up. Give it a try, you'll definitely like it.""

Otto hesitated for a moment. Then he nodded. ""You know what? I'll try it.""

He paid for his groceries and packed them into bags. As he left the store, he again felt the stares, but now they seemed less intrusive, more accustomed. He stood on the sidewalk for a moment, squinting in the sun. The noise of the street, the smells of food, the crowd of people—it all suddenly seemed... normal. It was the first day of his new, normal life.

==================================

*Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: Early March 8th, 2130.*

*\[19 hours until Operation Void Whisper\]*

***Memory Transcription Subject: Vyly, Commander of the third Venlil Scouting and Self-Defense Fleet.*** 

8 *hours*.

That's all it took to reach Earth's atmosphere from GEO.

It wasn't *THAT* fast, but at least according to the captain, who had left the cockpit after we entered the coast phase of the trip in order to speak with us, since, well, we were 'special' passengers, the shuttle still had fuel to spare, and considering how efficient the engines apparently were, it could give our own shuttles a run for their money.

Overall, the trip was relatively boring, there wasn't much to do besides watching the movies available on the onboard entertainment system of the ship or finishing up my reports on my holo pad.

The funniest part of the trip was reentry itself, seeing the plasma through the windows while getting forcefully pressed against your seat to the point of almost fainting ripped some laughs out of my colleagues and me. Nikolai was surprisingly okay with the g forces for an ambassador, turns out that all human personnel that want to go to space must undergo special training, no exceptions.

Apart from the violent shaking from reentry, everything went normally, not a single problem aboard, and it wasn't long before things got calm again.

""Nikolai?"" Roldn spoke up.

""Yes?""

""How did you humans even manage to make these single-stage vehicles in the first place? Wouldn't it be more efficient to use standard rockets or antigravity engines instead?""

""That's actually a question that many politicians argued when the UN was discussing about how to replace the old vehicles we used in the past, we stopped using rockets because the sheer amount that we were using was starting to damage the atmosphere, in the end the UN created a treaty with the vast majority of its members that limits the amount of rocket launches per year to around a thousand or so, and launching rockets just to bring cargo down is just way too costly, as for antigravity engines, although we *do* have the technology to manufacture them through the same technology used to make our FTL drives, it's just not worth it.""

""Why not? If you can rid your vessels from the force of gravity, you would dramatically save up on costs!""

Nikolai snickered. ""Why would we? We have SSTOs and a Space Elevator at our disposal, developing the infrastructure to handle ships with anti-grav technology would cost an amount that we cannot afford *right now*, since the majority of our economy is currently focused on building up our space fleet.""

*He had a point.*

But before Roldn could speak up again, the onboard speakers flared to life.

""Attention all passengers, we will be landing in roughly 25 *minutes*, if you need to use the bathroom or want to stretch your legs, please do it now, I need everyone seated and with their seatbelts on within the next 10 *minutes* to ensure your safety.""

Nikolai sighed, ""Look, you guys are probably hungry. I know a vegan restaurant in the airport where we can get you something to eat, but after that, we will need to go meet with Noah, he will take you from the airport to the Training Camp via one of the [Maglev ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4L_0CDsd1I)routes. It's a 1 *hour* long journey, but it's very luxurious, you will be able to get some rest!""

*That sounds interesting, I really need a nap after 8 hours seated in an awkwardly shaped seat that wasn't made with beings with tails in mind...*

""Anyway!"" He continued, ""You will be granted some time to rest before you're allowed to start the training with our boarding forces, the UN worked closely with your government in order to build suitable housing for you. I think you guys probably already know that.""

""Honestly I'm more worried about the attention we will possibly get when we get off this aircraft, we won't be swarmed by reporters, right?"" I questioned.

""Nope, not at all, I've already contacted the people responsible for the airport, they will be closing off the section where we will be going through, we will basically have an entire part of the airport for ourselves, you will be included in a few photos at most, not much we can do about that, sadly.""

I flicked my tail before nodding like humans do, ""right, you heard him guys, we will grab something to eat, and then we will be in for another trip.""

A bunch of whines was the answer I got back.

""You owe me a drink after this mission, chief, my legs hurt from staying still for so long..."" Vryt complained.

""Nobody was stopping you from getting up from your seat during the coasting period before we entered the atmosphere, though, why would he owe you a drink because of a pain you could've avoided altogether?"" Nikolai interjected, making me laugh.

""You know, he has a point, Vryt, Vasti *did* get up to use the onboard bathroom.""

""I don't care*.* You still owe me a drink from other times where I saved your sorry ass from an arxur ambush like, *4 years ago*. You're buying me some booze when we get home whether you like it or not.""

""Why not buy it here? Of course, you won't be allowed to train after drinking, but you could get yourselves some alcohol to drink during your free time."" Nikolai offered.

That caught the attention of our entire group.

""Look..."" Roldn started, ""while your offer is certainly tempting, I pretty much doubt you humans have anything that will be able to make us drunk in a reliable way, we have the highest alcohol tolerance in the galaxy."" He whistled.

I flicked my tail, ""It's worth a try, though.""

""You guys most likely will enjoy the great variety of types of alcohols we have available."" Nikolai admitted while shaking his head, ""anyway, we gotta wait now, we have 20 *minutes* until we land.""

=================================================================

\[Time skip: 20 minutes\]

The landing went uneventfully, thankfully, apart from the noticeable angle of attack that the shuttle we were in landed with, it wasn't that different from the airplanes back home.

After helping us get our equipment from the back of the aircraft, Nikolai was the first to exit through one of the doors, he explained to us our schedule, in total, we had roughly *2 hours* before we had to meet up with Noah in the boarding area of the airport. And true to his word, there was almost no one in the area we were going through, if you excluded Nikolai and a few security personnel patrolling the place, it almost felt as if the building had been closed entirely for us.

We arrived quite quickly at our first stop, which was a restaurant, already waiting for us to be their first clients of the *day*. The people working there were surprisingly happy to be attending us, I could practically *see* their excitement, they even asked to take a photo with us. Of course, my friends decided to pack some of the food to eat later. Since we were already running a bit late.

A quick stop at a bathroom whose toilets were a *bit* too tall for venlil to comfortably use, we headed to the 'maglev' station.

Noah was already there waiting for us, when he noticed our arrival, he quickly moved to greet us, he made brief talk with Nikolai, before moving his attention to us. Nikolai gave his goodbyes before leaving.

""Hello guys, as you might already know, my name is Noah, a pleasure to meet you, anyways, the train we will be taking should arrive in roughly *10 minutes*, you guys have any questions?""

No one spoke up, Noah just shrugged after a few moments.

""Alright, I guess we just have to wait now.""

""Couldn't we have just landed straight at the facility, though? why do we need to take a train to get there?"" Roldn suddenly spoke up.

""The facility's airport is just way too small to allow an aircraft the size of a cargo shuttle to land there, if you had taken a private jet after going down through the Space Elevator, then maybe we could've done that, but considering you preferred to come down aboard a shuttle, that *sadly* didn't happen. Thankfully, there's a Maglev station just five kilometers away from the base! It's very likely that we will be meet someone there who will take us to the facility itself.""

I flicked my tail in affirmation.

Time flew by relatively quickly, And before we knew, the train we were going to be boarding was already approaching the station.

It was significantly different from the trains we had back in Venlil Prime, outside of their design, of course, the train didn't hang down the rails like the ones back home, its nose was very long, almost as if someone had stretched it out.

We quickly entered the first class wagon, everything inside *screamed* luxury, brahk, someone could probably sleep in those seats with how comfortable they looked!

After storing our equipment above our seats, a waiter quickly appeared to offer us something to eat and drink, everyone save for Noah asked for something, which was some kind of energy drink.

In less than 5 *minutes*, the train started to move, the soft hum of electric engines moved the entire vehicle forward, but it soon became clear that they weren't the only means that it used to move, after a few more *minutes*, the humming stopped and the train appeared to start... *floating*? It wasn't like floating vehicles weren't common back home, on the contrary, it was the norm, but the vehicle we were currently in lacked the anti grav engines used in the Federation.

According to Noah,[ the train used magnets to float](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666790821001774).

It didn't take long after that to get up to speed, the things nearest to the rails quickly became a blur, a lengthy mountain chain in the background was the only thing that sat relatively unmoving.

""Well then!"" Noah started, capturing everyone's attention by briefly clasping his hands before pulling something out of his backpack.

""Have you guys played with cards before?""

=================================================================

\[Time skip: 50 minutes\]

***Memory transcription subject: Noah, UN ambassador, formerly DCEG's ambassador.***

I didn't think Venlil would be competitive, but it seemed like I had greatly underestimated them.

""-Buy the brahking cards! You didn't say brahking uno!"" Roldn screamed at Vyly.

""I brahking said it! Both Vryt and Vasti heard me!""

""The hell you did! Buy the cards before I shove the rest of my cards down your throat-""

I was too occupied laughing my ass off to stop the fight breaking out, it seemed like that uno could split the friendship of even other species.

Vyly reluctantly drew 2 other cards from the pile, the game continued, only for Vasti to throw a draw 4 on Vyly. I swear I could hear his blood pressure rising.

""For Brahk's sake, a draw 4?! Really?! I thought you valued our friendship, Vasti!""

She whistled in return, ""Calm down, Vyly, it's just a game.""

Vyly almost threw his cards down, he reluctantly drew four more cards, only to stiffen for a brief moment, he then threw down another draw 4 on Vryt, and another fight started to break out.

It took a few more minutes for the last match to end, Roldn won while I wiped laughing tears away from my eyes.

""Alright guys, you can keep the cards, we are only 6 minutes away from our destination, it seems like you guys *really* liked playing Uno, you might as well keep it so you guys can enjoy it during your breaks while you train with our troops.""

""I don't think this game will be beneficial for us, you saw yourself how our friendship almost broke in the past three matches of this game."" Vyly wryly commented, but Roldn apparently disagreed, as he started to gather the cards in the box they came in before stuffing them in his suitcase.

""I hadn't had this much fun in months, I will make sure to show this game to my kids back home, I can't wait to see the chaos break out between them."" He said while giving a short whistle, to which Vyly scoffed.

""You're only this angry because you lost, Vyly, pull yourself together."" Vasti chimed in.

""Say one more word and I will deck your paycheck so hard even your grandchildren will know poverty!"" He spat back.

Thankfully, before things could escalate, the train started to slow down, if everything went well, a car would be waiting for us in the station to take us to our final destination.

I helped the little group pack their things so that we could leave the wagon faster, we made some brief talk, more about if they would be allowed to rest before starting the training, what types of food they would be offered, and stuff.

I was a bit afraid that we would have to wait for the car, but luckily, it was already there, only a few hundred meters away from us,two security guards already out, waiting to take us.

It was a sleek mini-van, big enough to comfortably fit 8 to 10 people, the aliens I was accompanying couldn't stop themselves from showing signs of excitement, from what they'd told me, they were tired, the promise that they would be allowed to rest during the first day of their stay was probably the only thing stopping them from having slept during the trip inside the maglev.

Luckily, everything went well, it only took a few minutes to secure their stuff in the cargo compartment, but after that, they were allowed to relax at their seats, which had been specially retrofitted with their tails in mind, a fact that they were thankful for.

Hopefully things would end up well...

=================================================================

***Memory Transcription Subject: Vyly, Commander of the third Venlil Scouting and Self-Defense Fleet.*** 

A few dozen *minutes* later, we were finally at our final stop. This was one lengthy journey, I could feel the exaustion on my colleagues, the skies of the region we were currently in were already starting to darken, if there was a thing I was certain is that our biological clocks would be thrown off.

""Well, this is where we part ways, I have things to do back at the UN headquarters, you guys will be in good hands, Vyly has my contact in case anything happens, please don't hesitate to contact me."" Noah spoke up when the vehicle started to round up to enter the base, which looked like a concrete fortress inside a mountain range.

""Well, it was good while it lasted, thanks for the card game too, though."" Roldn answered.

""I will give you guys a tour around the base tomorrow, I will take you and your comrades to the room you will be staying in during this period, as for the food, the restaurant with the vegan and vegetarian food options is right in front of your quarters, you just need to follow the signs, do expect to be the center of attention for a few *hours.""* The guard that was driving spoke up in a deep voice, briefly startling me.

""You can call me Hubert. It's an honor to meet all of you."" He continued, briefly looking at us through a small mirror slightly to his left before looking forward again.

""You probably already know our names, it's a pleasure to meet you, I hope that we can cooperate and help each other on how to fight better."" I responded with a flick of my ears, given that my tail was behind my seat.

""If I were you and your friends, I would make the best use of these last few hours before your training starts, because boy, if they put your peers under the same dudes who trained me and my friends, you're in for one hell of a headache, they will probably correct even the way you breathe."" He chuckled.

""...They can't be that bad, right?"" Vasti mumbled.

""One dude that was in my regiment had a psychotic episode after one instructor got a bit too stressed because he couldn't keep up with the others. That most likely will not happen with any of you since you're special people with a lot of political protection and stuff, you're an alien boarding squad, after all, if anything happened to any of you, everyone here would get fired and most likely locked up until investigations finished. Don't worry though, we've already been briefed in the situation. No one's allowed to harm you under any circumstances.

If anything, the most they will do is yell at you in order to get you to stop doing something, which I can *guarantee* will happen, but I think that's common within your own training regiments, specially if the recruits misbehave, am I right?""

""...You are not entirely wrong, but I can't help but be a bit afraid of how you humans train your special forces..."" Vyly commented in a slightly scared tone, to which Hubert just smiled while looking at us through the front mirror.

""Don't worry, we won't make you undergo the same training our own soldier go.""

=================================================================

I LIVE! Took some time to finish this one! hope you guys found some other series to follow while I was away =D.

I will try to return to the old schedule if possible, university was a turmoil for the first few weeks, hope it won't become a mess again.

See you guys hopefully soon! And also, let me know your opinions on how you think the venlil squad will fare in the tests inside the training facility ;D",31,1761417033.0,NatureofPredators,4,1.0,False

‍

**Why This Pick?**

I’m going for the big plus money bag today, friends. It looks like Los Angeles is finally finding their footing after a nice victory over the Dallas Stars! And, to be honest, the Predators’ offense seems to be stuck on the struggle bus. Having said that, the reason I’m going after a Kings win in regulation is because it’s looking like Justus Annunen (5.07 GAA) will get the start for Nashville, and the Kings have a clear advantage with Darcy Kuemper (2.59 GAA) in net. Despite their last two outings requiring OT to get the job done, I don’t think LA will need it here. Give me the Kings to bag a victory before the clock runs out.

***\*Update, 9:20AM PST:*** Nashville has changed their goalie from Annunen to Saros! Those bastards, lol... That said, I don't love the Predators' offense; Kings still bag the regulation win in my opinion.

Hoping for some fresh eyes on my weird living room situation! There’s a fireplace on one side at a weird angle, windows everywhere (which I don’t want to block with a TV), and a balcony door that opens inward. Basically, there’s no obvious spot for a TV, and I’m stuck.

Here’s what I’m working with:

* TVs available: I have both a 65"" and a 50"" TV that I could use in here

That’s where men’s down vests come in, striking the perfect balance between function and fashion. Light, comfortable, and super versatile, these vests are the ultimate transitional weather piece every guy should have in his wardrobe.

Down vests are more than just a style statement. They offer core warmth without the bulk, thanks to their lightweight insulation. Whether you're commuting to work, heading out for a weekend hike, or just grabbing coffee in town, a well-fitted vest adds that extra layer of comfort without making you feel overheated. Throw it over a hoodie, sweater, or long-sleeve tee, and you're good to go. Their sleeveless design also allows for full arm mobility—perfect for staying active and stylish all at once.

One of the standout features of down vests is their layering potential. Want to elevate a simple outfit? Add a sleek vest over your ensemble, and instantly it looks more put together. Plus, they pair effortlessly with casual, smart-casual, and even sporty looks. From flannel shirts and joggers to chinos and boots, there's no shortage of outfit combos you can create. The key is to play with textures, tones, and layers to find the balance that works best for your style.

**Replica Moncler men's down vests** offer that same high-end look and functionality without the hefty price tag. They’re a smart investment for fashion-conscious guys who want premium aesthetics on a budget. The modern cuts, quality materials, and attention to detail make them a solid choice for upgrading your outerwear game. Whether you're going for a minimalist vibe or something bold and urban, a replica vest can easily become your go-to layering piece this season.

So, if you’re looking to stay warm without sacrificing style, it's time to rethink how you layer. Down vests deliver unbeatable versatility and comfort, making them an essential part of any fall-to-winter transition wardrobe.",1,1761416827.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

1ofyt3s,https://i.redd.it/5pihir2awaxf1.png,Struggling with TV placement in a weird-shaped living room,"Hey everyone,

Hoping for some fresh eyes on my weird living room situation! There’s a fireplace on one side at a weird angle, windows everywhere (which I don’t want to block with a TV), and a balcony door that opens inward. Basically, there’s no obvious spot for a TV, and I’m stuck.

Here’s what I’m working with:

* Attached: Photos and floor plans to show the space and furniture layout
* Current furniture: Couch, two accent chairs, coffee table, a few end tables; open to rearranging
* TVs available: I have both a 65"" and a 50"" TV that I could use in here
* I’m renting, so I can’t make any major changes (no tearing down walls, but a wall mount could work if renter-friendly)

Would like the TV placed for a good viewing angle from the main couch, without looking awkward in the living room or ending up at an odd angle, where the back of the TV is visible as one enters from the main door.  
I’d love to get any ideas about where the TV could go, and whether a stand or wall mount would work best (or if there’s some clever solution I just haven’t thought of yet). If you’ve figured out a weird living room before, I’d especially appreciate creative layout fixes or product recommendations for stands and mounting options.

I’ve been staring at this room for way too long, so any advice, especially on making sure the main couch has the best possible view, would be a huge help. Thanks so much in advance!",1,1761416746.0,InteriorDesignAdvice,0,1.0,False

Alright, ipudu  let’s get to the main part…

A guy from Godavari navigating life abroad. Over the years of exploring life, I’ve learnt to value compassion and integrity, qualities I hold with utmost value in my life.

A romantic at heart, who spent decent time understanding who I am and what I bring to the table. I enjoy my solitude almost as much as hanging out with friends. Work tarvata na cofeelu, walks, gym, music, books, spirituality, friends tho kaburlu, ala gadipestunna jeevithanni. I’m highly optimistic about life and have gone on a deep journey within myself to understand who I am.
I deeply respect women for who they are. I also respect and value all kinds of relationships in my life,from friends to even my partners in previous relationships. Each connection taught me something and shaped the person I am today.
Would love to meet a girl, hold her close as we drink warm coffees, rehman music ,and talk about every random thing in this world. Trust me, I’m a good listener. Really love my tech work and have developed great sense of passion for it . I’m a man of depth, someone who questions the structures of this society. If you’re open enough for deep talks and want to navigate life with a like minded soul, let’s see where this goes. Also there are still parts of my life that are a little unstable, but hey, isn’t life always like that? Daatukuni mundarki velpodamey

A decent-looking girl (looks matter kadandi konchem anna 😉 roju morning lechaka aa mukham oka sense of warmth ivvali kada), preferably living in North America (hard rule kaadu) who wants to know a guy beyond his color, caste, and religion, because those don’t matter to me anymore.

But I realised it only gets you so far. You can know all the hacks and principles, but if you feel like shit, none of it really matters. Too often when I got up on a dark winter morning ‘fuck off, just give me my coffee’ was the mental self talk.

I’m not religious but sometimes wish I was, I feel like if you have a strong enough belief in some sort of ultimate purpose you can suffer almost anything, it’s like the ultimate fuel.

And I realised there were times in my life I had that feeling—that amazing drive that a solid purpose gives you. I remembered music I associated with those times so I decided to make a playlist of it and listen every morning in a hope to ‘brainwash’ myself into this feeling. Whilst generating a new ‘ultimate purpose’ that would tick all my boxes and satisfy my true values.

Then I thought why not add EVERYTHING going into this little routine? Breathwork, trance, hypnosis, visualisation, anchoring, symbolism, metaphor, manifesting… etc.

We live as if conscious knowledge is the main thing that changes behaviour, but I think it’s much more about how we FEEL and what we BELIEVE. If we can work those levers we’re on to something!

So I started making this stuff with a professional musician and it’s taking on a life of its own. I’ve got free tracks to share with anyone who’s interested.

I have a PhD in neuroscience, I’m a medical doctor and I’m training to be a psychiatrist, and whilst this is absolutely NOT clinical—I think my experience has helped me make stuff that is credible and not woo-woo, because a lot of folks out there are understandably suspicious of that vibe in wellness.

I want this stuff to help other people so let me know if you’re interested!

1ofyrcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eugene/comments/1ofyrcw/waste_to_taste_a_quick_how_to/,Waste to Taste - a quick how to,"With SNAP losses and the general economy all around us, I wanted to make sure I shared my experience with Waste to Taste so that anyone who is on the fence about going can feel a little more comfortable. 

A few points:
- run by the Burrito Brigade
- does NOT require income verification
- open from 3-6pm on weekdays
- requires an appointment to visit (for crowd control only!)

Waste to Taste is on 6th Ave just past Charnelton, and shares a parking lot with the Houndstooth bar. The store entrance is on the other side of the building facing the used car lot (the exit lets out to the parking lot, since the flow inside the store is one-way).

When you walk in through the door, there are piles of bags and boxes on either side of you. Grab a few, since that's what you'll take your groceries home in (Costco style).

When you enter the store proper (about ten feet after the main entrance), the volunteer at the front asks for your first name, last initial, and how many in your household, and then you can start shopping!

Bread and produce are always unlimited, so you can take as much as you need. Other items will have limits, which change daily and are displayed on large pink or orange signs above the items.

As you start down the first aisle, on your left are tea bags, coffee pods, pouches of formula or other food, etc. Sometimes there's over the counter medication too - always dependent on availability. 

On your right are the bread shelves; you can see loaves of bread of many kinds, hot dog buns, hamburger buns, challah, garlic bread, bagels, and anything else that came through that day.

As you reach the end of this aisle, you will see some bulk dry goods or other items on shelves - I usually can find some good pasta and tortillas there.

Turning right, you will pass more bread, like baguettes and bagels, and then you come to the produce. Rounding the corner will bring you into the produce aisle, where you can usually find onions, potatoes, leafy greens, tomatoes, root vegetables, and various other veggies. Further along the aisle you come to the fruit, where you see apples, orange, strawberries, peaches, etc.

Straight ahead are the sweets! I have found some delicious cakes, cupcakes, brownies, and more. There are usually gluten-free treats there too, always labeled.

This is where you pause before the protein station, as there is usually someone at the station ahead of you. Once the volunteer behind the table calls you forward, they will ask how many in your household, and tell you how many meats you can get.

There is a large white board with various meats labeled - you can ask for any of the ones they have listed. The volunteer will get it from the freezer and if it's not what you wanted or doesn't work for you, you can always ask for something else instead.

Usually, you can also get meat substitutes, eggs, milk, yogurt, and cheese - just ask!

The final station is behind you once you finish at the protein station. These two refrigerators hold prepared foods, packaged greens and veggies, or any other refrigerated goods from the grocery stores.

Then you head out the door and you're at the parking lot! Don't forget to thank the volunteers as you leave 😉

All of the food is from local grocery stores, and is the stuff they are legally required to toss but is still good. Occasionally I get home and find a little mold on the rolls I grabbed, or the veggies are a little worse for wear, but overwhelmingly the food is still very good and high-quality. 

TLDR: Waste to Taste is just like a standard grocery store, without a cashier! Help keep food out of the landfills and in your kitchens instead.

Feel free to ask me any questions! I hope this helps to demystify the experience and make it a little easier for folks to go.

Brigade Brigade just bought a new building to make a larger store soon! So hopefully we'll see many more appointments and some walk-ins when they are in the new space.

If you can, please donate money! Burrito Brigade is a very small organization with dedicated and overworked staff and a ton of dedicated and overworked volunteers - all making a VERY big impact.",116,1761416627.0,Eugene,13,0.99,False

 Hunter – MacBook Pro (M2, Space Gray)

> “I need performance and silence.”
He’s the type who swears he only bought it for “mission efficiency,” but secretly uses the trackpad to zoom in on holo-maps and check Omega’s drawings.
Always organized, always low battery because he forgets to charge.



💬 Tabs open: Mission briefings, Spotify’s “Focus” playlist, reminders to keep the team alive.

 Wrecker – Asus TUF Gaming Laptop

> “Bro it’s got RGB lights, it glows!”
He doesn’t even game much — just watches explosion compilations and eats chips while the fans sound like a jet taking off.
Has like 60 stickers on the lid and a cracked corner from “accidentally testing its durability.”



💬 Tabs open: YouTube memes, food delivery, explosion gifs, and maybe one tab that says “how to fix laptop I dropped.”


Tech – Custom-Built Linux Machine

> “Windows is for amateurs.”
This man compiles his own drivers. He’s running 3 operating systems at once and somehow the laptop hums like a small reactor.
His setup includes 3 monitors, a keyboard that clicks like a death star console, and zero cable management.



💬 Tabs open: Command terminal, 18 research papers, 6 unfinished side projects, and a script automating everyone’s coffee orders.


Echo – Lenovo ThinkPad

> “Reliable. Military-grade. Efficient.”
He’s not here for aesthetics — it’s all about function. Keys worn out, stickers peeling, but it never crashes.
Uses keyboard shortcuts like an ancient Sith uses Force lightning.



💬 Tabs open: Schematics, spreadsheets, and clone veterans’ support forums.


 Omega – iPad with Magic Keyboard

> “It’s just easier to draw on!”
She’s got the pastel pink case, millions of cute stickers, and every background is of the squad.
Her Notes app is a mix of doodles, mission plans, and random “Hunter look at this animal!” screenshots.



💬 Tabs open: Pinterest, holo-YouTube, and an 87-tab deep rabbit hole of baby rancors.

 Crosshair – Razor Blade Stealth (Matte Black)

> “Gets the job done.”
No stickers, no wallpaper, no desktop icons — just pitch black efficiency.
He cleans the screen with military precision and refuses to connect to public Wi-Fi.
Muted notifications. Mails marked read but never answered.



💬 Tabs open: Sniper scope calibration software, maybe Spotify “Dark Synthwave,” and a single Google tab: “how to block everyone.”



Bonus: If they all sat together in a café —

Wrecker’s fan would drown out Tech’s typing.

Hunter would glare at everyone’s screens.

Crosshair would bring wired earbuds “because Bluetooth is unreliable.”

Omega’s iPad brightness would be on MAX and she’d be showing everyone cat gifs.

Echo would just sigh. Deeply. Like a man who’s seen too much.



....................


 If the Bad Batch had modern smartphones


Hunter – iPhone 15 Pro (Titanium Gray)

> “It’s reliable. It works. That’s all I need.”
He doesn’t care about specs or fancy widgets — he just wants good camera quality for mission scans and Omega’s selfies.
Always on Do Not Disturb. 75 unread messages from Wrecker.
Wallpaper: a sunset from some random mission planet.



💬 Uses: Maps, Notes, Voice Memos, Spotify “Focus Mode” playlist
📱Screen time: 2h/day — disciplined like his whole life depends on it.


 Wrecker – Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (with a cracked screen 😭)

> “Bro the zoom on this thing is crazy!!”
Half his gallery is memes, food pics, and accidental screenshots.
Volume always at 100%. Has a custom ringtone that’s basically an explosion sound.
Drops it daily, still refuses a case because “it’s fine.”



💬 Uses: YouTube, TikTok, PUBG, food delivery apps
📱 Screen time: 14h/day (mostly memes and snack research)


Tech – Google Pixel 8 Pro (rooted, obviously)

> “The AI integration is satisfactory, but I’ve optimized it further.”
He disabled 90% of the default apps, coded his own widgets, and syncs his phone with his laptop, goggles, and probably his toothbrush.
Has custom notifications that announce who’s texting by voice.
If you touch his phone, he’ll instantly know.



💬 Uses: Tasker automation, calculator, terminal emulator, obscure tech forums
📱 Screen time: Infinite (he probably is the algorithm)


 Echo – Nokia XR21 (rugged military phone)

> “It survives drops, EMPs, and Wrecker.”
Not flashy, but built like a tank.
Has zero social apps — just Messages, Calls, and Calendar.
Still types with both thumbs like it’s a tactical operation.



💬 Uses: Mission logs, encrypted comms, and Clone veterans’ chat groups
📱 Screen time: 1h/day, but the man answers every message within 3 seconds.


Omega – iPhone SE (2023, Pink case, 100 stickers)

> “Look! I made it cute 🥰✨”
Her phone’s loaded with photos, games, and holo-diary entries.
She texts everyone constantly — especially Crosshair — and uses 7 emojis per sentence.
Wallpaper: the whole Batch posing awkwardly.



💬 Uses: Camera, Pinterest, Duolingo (learning languages for fun), Notes full of doodles
📱 Screen time: 9h/day (half of that messaging Hunter)


Crosshair – Old-school BlackBerry or minimalist Android

> “Does it text? Then it’s fine.”
He doesn’t like touchscreens, doesn’t trust cloud backups, and definitely has no social media.
Phone always on silent.
He answers once every 3 days with one-word replies: “Yes.” “No.” “Busy.”



💬 Uses: Clock, Maps, Weather (for wind direction 😎)
📱 Screen time: 10 minutes/day (and hates every one of them)


 Bonus: Their Group Chat

Hunter: “Mission briefing at 0700.”

Tech: sends coordinates in encrypted code

Wrecker: sends 36 memes

Echo: “Wrecker stop.”

Omega: “Good morning 💕🌸✨🌈🥰🥰🥰”

Crosshair: seen 5:42 AM

The other day, I went to a funeral for my childhood friend’s little sister, who committed suicide. I’m late 20s, this young woman was early 20s. I had lost touch with them for years, but the news and the funeral service brought back so many memories for me. I had known her since she was a little girl. 



While at the funeral service, I kept bumping into other old friends and acquaintances. There were a lot of people my parents’ age there. And I became so frustrated, because the people my parents’ age were using this as a networking opportunity. Asking me what I’m doing, where I’m working, if I know so-and-so. I saw lots of smiles and giggling from the people my parents’ age. 



When do we say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH? A young woman died, tragically, and the family is absolutely in shock and heartbroken. This is not the time to offer to connect me with an employee of yours for a coffee. This is not the time to ask me to edit your zoomer child’s college essays. I mean who the fuck do people think they are??



I have had enough of this bullshit. If you can’t put the itch to network and schmooze on pause for 2 hours, to pay respects to a grieving family, then you should stay the fuck home.

I got home from work three weeks ago and he was sitting at the kitchen table with dinner plated. He'd been doing this every night for months. Flowers on Fridays. Little notes in my lunch. Constant texts asking how my day was going. It felt like drowning.

I sat down and barely touched the food. He asked if something was wrong. I snapped.

""You're suffocating me. I can't breathe. I need you to back off and let me figure things out.""

He just nodded. Didn't argue. Didn't ask questions. He said, ""Okay. Take whatever time you need.""

That was it. I thought he'd push back or get emotional. Instead he cleared the table, went upstairs, and I heard him on the phone with someone for about an hour. I assumed it was his brother or a friend.

The next morning I woke up and all his notifications were gone from my phone. No location sharing. No calendar sync. Nothing. I texted him asking why he turned everything off.

He replied once. ""You said you needed space. I'm giving it to you. Contact me when you're ready to talk.""

Then silence.

I figured he'd crack in a few days. He always did. But a week went by and nothing. No calls. No texts. He went to work, came home, stayed in the guest room. We were roommates. It was exactly what I asked for and it felt wrong.

Here's the thing. I'd been seeing someone from my gym for about four months. It started as coffee after workouts, then drinks, then more. He made me feel exciting again. Like I was twenty five instead of thirty eight. My husband knew something was off but he kept trying to fix it with gestures instead of asking the hard questions.

When my husband backed off completely, I had more time. More freedom. I spent almost every evening with the other guy. Told my husband I was working late or meeting friends. He never questioned it. Never checked my location because he couldn't anymore. It was perfect.

Until two weeks in when the gym guy started acting weird. His texts got shorter. Plans kept getting cancelled. Then one night I showed up at his place like we'd planned and his roommate answered.

""He's not here. And he told me to tell you he's done. He doesn't want drama.""

I called him seventeen times. Every single one went to voicemail. Then I was blocked. Completely ghosted.

I sat in my car outside his building for an hour trying to process it. This guy who'd been love bombing me for months just vanished. And I realized I'd burned everything with my husband for someone who didn't even respect me enough to end things to my face.

I drove home and my husband's car wasn't there. I texted him asking where he was. Nothing. I called. Straight to voicemail. I checked his location and remembered I couldn't. Panic hit me like a truck.

I sent him twenty messages that night. ""Where are you?"" ""Please answer me."" ""I'm sorry, we need to talk."" ""Please come home.""

He replied the next afternoon. ""I'm staying with my brother for a while. I think it's better if we have some real distance. I'll be in touch about next steps.""

Next steps. Like we were business partners dissolving a company.

I called his brother, who I've known for fifteen years. He answered and his voice was cold.

""He doesn't want to talk to you right now. You told him to back off. He's backing off. What did you expect?""

I tried explaining that I didn't mean it like this. That I was confused and overwhelmed. He cut me off.

""You've been cheating on him. He knows. He's known for weeks. He hired someone to follow you because you were acting so suspicious. He has photos, timestamps, everything. He was giving you a chance to come clean and you didn't. So now he's done.""

My stomach dropped through the floor. Everything made sense. The sudden space. The calm acceptance. He wasn't giving me what I asked for. He was giving me enough rope to hang myself.

I begged his brother to let me talk to him. He said no and hung up.

That was four days ago. My husband texted yesterday saying his lawyer would be contacting me soon. He's filing for divorce. He screened every piece of evidence over those two weeks. Every lie I told. Every time I said I was working late and I wasn't. He has it all.

His family won't talk to me. My own parents said I made my bed. The guy I threw everything away for won't even acknowledge I exist. And my husband, who spent months trying to save us, is completely done.

I keep replaying that night at the kitchen table. If I'd just been honest. If I'd asked for actual help instead of pushing him away. But I wanted the safety of my marriage and the excitement of something new. I wanted everything and now I have nothing.

So, am I the one who ruined this or did he manipulate me by giving me exactly what I asked for?

1ofyple,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1ofyple/lost_wife_to_addiction_2_different_people_pls/,Lost Wife to Addiction - 2 different people?  Pls comment if you've experienced this.,"For anyone that has lost their spouse to addiction, do you consider them 2 different people?  1 before the addiction and 1 after?

I find it very difficult processing the loss of my wife.  One way that helps is understanding that the person who was addicted, wasn't actually my wife.  It wasn't the person I dated and married, starting Xmas day 2005.  It wasn't the joyful, nurturing soul who was excited for life (cooking, working out, going out, vacations, etc.).  She loved to cook, go on coffee runs with me, experience new recipes, get excited to go on vacations, enjoy zumba/working out/dancing/hiking/shopping.  She also was big time into health, and enjoyed implementing natural health remedies.

My addicted spouse was completely different (2021-2024 when she passed).  She was very negative, she didn't like working out, didn't like cooking anymore, and ultimately blamed me for anything and everything that went wrong.  She kept saying she was going to go back to normal, but never did.  It was sad and frustrating to see this unfold in front of my eyes over a 3.5 year period.  Laid in bed most of the day in the dark, except when it was time for dinner and drinking.  The AC would be freezing cold.  I tried and tried and tried to encourage her to no avail.

So back to my question - do you consider them 2 completely different people?  Does this rationalization help with the grieving process?  When she passed, I explained things this way, then fell away from it, and have now come back to it.  Was I perfect?  Heck no.  Did I try my very best, heck yeah.  I think it boils down to not taking anything she said and did personally during her addictive state and wanting to remember her and our marriage for what it truly was before the addiction.  Any thoughts are very welcome.  Thank you.

1ofypaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrcreeps/comments/1ofypaj/dog_eat_dog_chapter_1/,Dog Eat Dog [Chapter 1],"Two years after my first hunt, the night before the Harvest Moon, I was at the local tavern playing a game of liar’s dice against some other hunters, including Arthur. By the time midnight came around, it was just the two of us playing. He looked at me through a squinted eye. The other was covered by a black patch.



“Four sixes,” he said.



“Bullshit,” I remarked.



Begrudgingly, he lifted his cup, revealing a three, two fives, and two sixes. In the end, the pot was mine. I collected my winnings and redistributed them to the other players, buying another round of bitter beer that was brewed locally. For Arthur, I bought him a cup of peppermint tea.



It was around this time when we heard footsteps marching outside. People cheered as a group of hunters burst into the tavern, carrying a beast on their shoulders, riddled with arrows and bullets. Arthur leapt from his seat so fast that he almost knocked over his tea.



“Is it Baskerville?” he asked no one in particular.



“Calm down,” one of the hunters said. “It ain’t your precious Baskerville. We went and caught us the Banshee Beast. Bastard screamed until his last breath.”



Arthur relaxed and returned to his seat. Every hunter knew Baskerville was reserved for Arthur. An easy request considering a majority of hunters didn’t believe Baskerville was real. I knew Arthur to be an honest man, always. But even I had my doubts about Baskerville’s existence. In the last two years, I’d yet to see a beast that could move with the shadows.



The tavern owner doled out a round for the returning hunters, claiming he’d have their beast beheaded and taxidermied. He’d hang it up with the other beast heads mounted on the walls. There were almost too many of them to count, but I only ever noticed the one at the back of the room. Silvery fur, jagged teeth, marble red eyes. Arthur’s kill but my beast.



While I sat and bullshitted with Arthur, the hunters eventually scattered, finding seats across the bar. They were a rambunctious lot. Constantly chattering and laughing. Trading stories, taunts, or jabs, depending on what mood they were in. Successful hunts brought out the best in us.



Smoke wafted through the air from their pipes and hand-rolled cigarettes. The smell of yeast was potent. As well as the sweeter scents of red wine. Although previous experience had told me the wine was almost as bitter as the beer.



A group of people played live music on stage. Equipped with acoustic guitars and flutes and banjos and whatever else they’d manage to get their hands on. They were singing an old world song called “Randy Dandy Oh”. A naval shanty originally from the 1800s.



I was just about to start a game of poker with Arthur and the boys when the tavern doors flew open. Sofia Lopez, a local medic, came rushing in. She stopped at the entryway, scanned the crowd, and when she found me, she shouldered her way through the crowd.



“Trouble in paradise?” Arthur said slyly.



I kicked him under the table and tossed my cards back into the pile. Sofia was one of the few in town who avoided the tavern. Work at the physician’s office kept her too busy to celebrate like the rest of us.



“Last night’s hunters returned,” she said, panting.



“I’ve noticed,” I said. “What of it?”



“Nicolas’s platoon never came back.”



The Deadeye Hunter was overdue. Which either meant his crew got tied up during their hunt, or…



“They’re prob’ly just runnin’ behind,” I said.



Sofia shook her head. “Nicolas is never late.”



“What do you want me to do about it?” I glanced over at Arthur for support. He offered a haphazard shrug. “Maybe they got lost.”



She scoffed. “Nicolas has been a hunter longer than any of you. Do you really think he got lost?”



Sofia was in her early twenties. Lithe frame, silky black hair, darker skin. Bleeding heart, like my mother. But there was a hardness to her. One built from countless surgeries. Stitching hunters back together after long days battling beasts. I’d wager she’d seen more blood than the rest of us. More death too.



Two years ago, when she’d first arrived at our village, she was doe-eyed and quiet. People thought she was mute. Time and experience change you, though. I could attest to that.



I took a drink of beer and bit back the urge to grimace. “Look, you really want me to say it? If Nicolas or any of his crew haven’t come back yet, it means they’re prob’ly dead. If Nicolas is dead, then I assume he must’ve meant a monster of a beast out there. I pray to Solis that he was able to kill the beast before it finished him off.”



She cuffed me on the shoulder. “How can you act like you don’t give a shit? Nicolas was your friend. All of you. You’re just gonna consign him to death?”



“I’m not consigning him to shit,” I said, a growl in my throat. “Every hunter knows the risks. If they wanna take up arms against the beast, they’re doing so by their own consent. It was his choice to walk out of the village, and whether he comes back or not is up to him. There’s nothin’ I can do about it.”



Sofia leaned close. Her voice was low but firm. “Nicolas was there for you when Thomas died. He grieved your brother almost as much as you. He helped care for your mother, he looked after Jason whenever you were away on a hunt—”



I shoved away from the table and walked off. Sofia wasn’t going to give up that easily, though. She chased after me, a shadow at my heels.



“I don't know why you care so much,” I said over my shoulder. “It’s not like Nicolas was your friend.”



“Nick was a good man. He was a friend to everyone in the village. He looked after people—cared about them. And I want to know what happened to him out there,” she said. “What I don’t understand is how you can be so quick to give up on him.”



I stepped outside, and Sofia followed me. Some hunters and locals greeted me with waves and smiles. A few clapped me on the back as I started down the hillside toward the residential part of town.



“I’m not giving up on him,” I reassured her. “But you know the rules. We hunt. We kill the beasts. We don’t send out rescue teams. We don’t look for the dead.”



“What if he’s not dead?”



“Then he will be by morning. No one, not even Emilia the Ripper, could make it an entire night by herself.”



“Nicolas wasn’t alone.”



“Trust me, I know who he took with him on the hunt. Greybeards and new bloods. Hunters green as grass. Nicolas or not, they ain’t survivin’ the night either.”



Sofia shoved me. I stumbled forward a few paces and caught myself on the side of a building. Nearby, a mother and her child looked over at us. They quickly returned to their chores, knowing better than to get caught up in someone else’s drama.



“I see what people really mean to you,” Sofia remarked. “It’s so easy for you to just cut ‘em loose.”



“It’s easier to mourn a friend than hold out hope against the impossible. I liked Nicolas—he was practically a father to me after Thomas…” I sighed. “But going after him is a death wish. Especially if I go alone.”



“Then don’t go alone.”



I laughed. While Sofia had learned her way around the village, had become inured to some of our more harsh customs, she was still naive about the protocols hunters followed. Protocols first instituted by H.P. Corbet, our founding father. Those same protocols were still practiced under Sir Rafe’s administration. Whether we liked it or not.



Rules kept us civil. Kept us sane. Kept us alive.



“I’d have an easier time convincing hunters to butcher their own families than go out on a death wish,” I said. “Everyone liked Nicolas—they loved him. But I’m willin’ to wager not even a fourth of ‘em would go out lookin’ for him. Especially if they’re not being compensated for it, and we both know Sir Rafe wouldn’t authorize a search and rescue.”



“Doesn’t it concern you that there’s a beast out there that could kill Nicolas?”



“There’s a beast out there that could kill any of us. Never forget that.”



By then, Arthur had caught up to us. He soothed Sofia with half-hearted reassurances that Nicolas would return. “Just wait, you’ll see,” he said. He wrapped an arm around her shoulders and guided her back to the tavern. “Come now, I’ll buy you a drink. We can discuss it further.”



When they were out of sight, I turned for home. But I stopped short, staring at the dark little house at the end of the lane. The house that had once been full of laughter and songs.



Since the days of my father and Thomas, it’d become a hollow ruin just waiting to collapse. And it took everything I could do to keep it upright. That was my job. Not hunting beasts, not protecting the villagers, but keeping my family fed and safe.



But then, I had to wonder what Thomas would’ve done in my shoes. What my father might’ve done.



Instead of heading home, as I should have, I went to the north side where Sir Rafe’s estate resided. He lived in an old cathedral comprised of stone brick with tapered spires and arched windows of stained glass. The front doors were thick wood plated with strips of steel and bolts. A lantern hung from above, creaking in the wind, sending a flurry of shadows swirling at my feet.



I rapped my knuckles against the door and waited. A few moments later, I could hear footsteps from within. The front door opened. Emilia the Ripper greeted me. Blond hair, pale skin, face concealed beneath a hood. She was one of the few hunters who preferred the night.



“I need to speak with Sir Rafe,” I said.



“It’s late.” Her voice was low and gentle. A complete juxtaposition of her appearance. “He’s resting.”



“Then wake him. It’s urgent.”



Emilia studied me for a moment. We’d seen each other out on the field a handful of times, but other than those momentary encounters, we hardly ever interacted. I wouldn’t have been surprised if she slammed the door in my face, but instead, she stepped aside and gestured for me to enter.



The inside of Sir Rafe’s home was a stretch of velvet carpet over concrete floors. In the main hall, there were dozens of old pews where hunters would sit during our council meetings. Down another hallway was Sir Rafe’s personal chambers.



Half the room was a study. Furnished with a large wooden desk. The wall behind it was lined by shelves overflowing with dusty books. The other half, near the right side of the room, was outfitted with a pair of leather chairs sat before a fireplace.



When I entered, Sir Rafe sat in one of these chairs, bundled beneath several quilts and blankets. The hearth crackled and spat embers into the dark. The air stunk of vanilla intermingled with smoke. Both from the fireplace and from Sir Rafe’s pipe.



As I approached, Sir Rafe hummed a merry tune under his breath. A tune I didn’t recognize. He turned his head toward me. A smile pulled at his cracked lips, emphasizing the wrinkles of his face.



Long, wispy white hair cascaded around his shoulders. Grey hairs stippled his face. He was dressed in a dark button-up and smoking jacket with a scarf wrapped around his neck. His hands were covered by a pair of black fingerless gloves.



“Ah, if it isn’t Bernie the Bold,” he said. His words had an underlying croak to them. Old age combined with years of smoking had given him the voice of a toad.



Bernie the Bold was a nickname anointed by Sir Rafe himself. However, most of the others—villagers and hunters alike—preferred Bernadette the Barren. I didn’t care for either title, if I’m honest.



“I apologize, sir,” I said, bowing as was per custom. “I don’t mean to disturb your rest.”



He waved my concerns away and squawked with laughter. “It’s not often that I get a visitor so late. Come now, my child, take a seat. Let us converse in comfort. We can speak long into the night. Swapping stories and thoughts like classroom gossip.”



Suffice to say, Sir Rafe was a ‘peculiar’ man. Popular with the people for his whimsical nature. Babies and children didn’t care much for him, though. They found his withered visage slightly disquieting. They weren’t the only ones.



He sent Emilia away to fetch a kettle of hot water for coffee and tea. Before she could slip out, he asked her to grab a tray of cookies the school children had baked for him earlier that evening. 



My younger brother, Jason, had brought some of those cookies home with him. Hard as a brick, and while they were meant to resemble hunters, they looked more like charred men. I decided to make my visit brief to avoid having to endure any more of them.



“Sir, the reason I’m here is about Nicolas,” I began. “He went on a hunt earlier, and he hasn’t returned.”



Sir Rafe nodded ruefully and rubbed a hand over his stubbled cheeks. “Yes, I’ve heard. Tragic, tragic affair. I commend your concern, but alas, Nicolas and the others are lost to us now. We will hold a funeral for them and may Solis guide their souls to the Eternal Dream.”



“Sir, maybe we shouldn’t be so hasty about the matter. Nicolas is one of the best hunters we’ve got. If anyone could survive out there, it’s him.”



I knew the chances of survival were slim, but despite rationality, I had to feign optimism. If not for myself, then at the very least, for Sofia’s sake.



“Perhaps we could send out a search group,” I said. “If not to rescue them, then to confirm their deaths.”



He cocked an eyebrow. “Now, that is most curious. We’ve never sent out a search party before. Not even when H.P. Corbert didn’t return from his last hunt.”



“I know, sir, but—”



He laid a hand on mine, squeezing gently. “I understand. This is a hard thing to accept, but we must endure. That is the way of humanity.” He patted my hand before returning his to his lap. “Grieve for our fallen brothers and sisters, but don’t give your life for them. You have family and friends.”



“Nicolas has friends too,” I countered.



A pitiful smile appeared on his face. “Yes, I am aware. I was one of those friends. But right now, we don’t need to lose any more brothers or sisters. Not for Nicolas, not for me, not for anyone.”



It was then Emilia the Ripper returned with a tray of burned cookies and a kettle of hot water. She placed them on an endstand and poured two cups of coffee, adding a splash of pasteurized milk. She handed one cup to me and the other to Sir Rafe.



Despite the milk, the coffee was bitter. I choked it down, hoping to curry some favor from Sir Rafe. When he gestured to the cookies, insisting I have one, I forced one of those down as well, much to his delight.



“Please, Bernie,” he said, “do not wrack yourself with guilt over the demise of Nicolas. It can be hard, I know, but—”



He stopped speaking as Emilia leaned down and whispered in his ear. His lips pursed as she spoke, and his brow tightened. When Emilia was finished, he thanked her and rubbed a hand up and down her forearm.



“Bernie,” Sir Rafe said, “are you serious about wanting to look for Nicolas?”



“Of course,” I said. “I wouldn’t have come if I weren’t.”



“While I can’t permit a search and rescue operation, I can offer you a chance to join Lady Emilia on tomorrow’s hunt. She’ll be treading the same ground as Nicolas.”



I frowned. “And what exactly was Nicolas hunting for?”



“A few dens in a city known as Cairnsmouth. About thirty miles from here.”



Thirty miles was a long way to go for a hunt. We usually patrolled the surrounding area unless we thought there were resources worth scavenging for beyond our set perimeter.



“Somethin’ special about these dens?” I asked. “Must be if you’re going so far for ‘em.”



Sir Rafe turned to Emilia. She said, “Nicolas was sent after Gévaudan.”



My cookie and coffee almost came back up. Gévaudan was reportedly the largest and most vicious beast we’d ever seen. Although no one had encountered him in over a year.



That was part of the reason Bram the Conductor had retired from hunting. He became a school teacher and preacher instead. I had to hear about some of his lectures from Jason, and furtively, I was glad to be out of school.



I accepted the offer and finished my coffee. When I was done, Sir Rafe prepared for bed. Emilia the Ripper escorted me outside.



“We leave tomorrow at noon,” she said. “Be at the armory by eleven o’clock.”



“How many hunters are we taking?” I asked.



“Enough.”



I sneered. “Was that how many Nicolas had taken too?”



Her gaze was cold, biting. Her voice even more so. “Nicolas and his team were sent out on reconnaissance. They weren’t supposed to engage the enemy.”



I’d never known Nicolas to disobey an order. Which meant the enemy had engaged him first. If he really was looking for Gévaudan, then the possibility of him being alive was next to naught.



“Starting tomorrow,” Emilia said, “keep your comments to yourself.”



“Starting tomorrow, right?” I asked. “Well, if that’s the case, you can’t make a cup of coffee for shit. Y’know that?”



She snorted. “I’m Emilia the Ripper, you twat. Not Emilia the Housemaid.” She started to close the door. “Tomorrow, eleven o’clock sharp, or we’re leaving you behind.”",2,1761416485.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

1ofyk8r,https://i.redd.it/zh1h39bkuaxf1.jpeg,Spanx AirEssentials – my new “errand day” uniform,"So, I’ve been an AirEssentials fan for a while.  I’ve had the joggers and the longer pullovers plus the brushed versions that are wide leg but I just got the straight-leg pants and wow… these might be my favorite yet.

I wore them today for a full “real-life test drive”: dentist appointment, a couple errands, and a quick coffee stop. I paired them with the matching pullover and my Seaside cap — simple, monochrome, and super comfortable, but what stood out was the fit.

The straight-leg cut gives the whole look this elevated, almost tailored vibe. It still has that signature buttery AirEssentials feel (light, stretchy, drapey in the best way), but the leg line just makes everything look more polished. I felt like I could’ve swapped sneakers for loafers and walked straight into a casual meeting or lunch date.

A few quick thoughts for anyone debating these:
	•	They fit true to size but a little extra room in the hips to me, but the drape is more structured than the joggers — it elongates your legs in a really flattering way.
	•	The fabric still feels like that signature “cloud knit” texture — soft but not clingy.
	•	Definitely errand-day-to-brunch-to-travel-day approved.

If you already love the AirEssentials line and the wide leg pant options, the straight-leg version feels like its older, more sophisticated sister. It’s comfort with quiet confidence and honestly, I didn’t want to take them off.",3,1761416154.0,spanx,1,1.0,False
