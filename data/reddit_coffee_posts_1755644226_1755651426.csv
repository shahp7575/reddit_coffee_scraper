1mv0ns7,https://i.redd.it/mbwtootno2kf1.jpeg,Anyone know this novel?,"I can't believe that the prick who betrayed our relationship has the guts to come back.
Six years ago， the man who promised my forever left without a word, leaving me facing my pregnancy alone.
Thanks to my son Mark, I rebuilt myself piece by piece and found stability for Mark.
But I never expected to see him again, especially in my coffee shop.
""Amelia,"" he began, his voice hard. ""I need to talk to you.""
Six years. Now, here he was, parading his success in front of me as if those years had never happened.
Anger roiled up in me. I refused to talk to him. I turned to leave.
Dear God, don’t let him notice that he and Mark have the same hazel eyes with that distinctive, almost almond shape.
————————
Amelia's POV
The soft hum of chatter filled the cozy atmosphere of Blueberry Café. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and warm pastries wrapped around me like a familiar blanket as I wiped down the counter. Outside, the morning sunlight streamed through the glass windows, casting golden rays on the small tables.
Mornings at Blueberry cafe were always hectic and busy, filled with the villagers from my hometown, especially elderly men and women who often come to relax and take a cup of coffee.
Mark's giggles drew my attention to the corner of the café, where my six-year-old son sat, a small rocket in hand, soaring it through an imaginary galaxy. His green eyes sparkled with unbridled joy, and for a moment, my heart felt light.
This café was my sanctuary, a dream I'd turned into reality after everything I had endured. It was where I rebuilt myself piece by piece, where I found stability for Mark. I'd fought hard for this life.
The bell above the door jingled, drawing my attention to the entrance. I plastered on a warm smile, prepared to greet a regular customer. But the smile froze on my lips as my eyes landed on him.
Daniel Carter.
My breath hitched, and for a moment, I thought I was hallucinating. But no-there he stood, taller and more composed than the last time I'd seen him. Six years hadn't dulled the sharpness of his features or the confident way he carried himself. If anything, success had polished him into someone even more striking and polished.
Beside him was a tall, blonde woman who could have stepped out of a fashion magazine. She clung to his arm, her sleek outfit and dazzling smile radiating perfection.
""Amelia,"" Daniel said, his voice as familiar as the memories I tried to bury.
I forced myself to keep my expression neutral, though my heart felt like it might break free from my chest. ""Daniel.""
The woman beside him tilted her head, studying me. ""Aren't you going to introduce us, darling?"" Her voice was smooth, practiced.
""This is Elena Hayes,"" Daniel said, his tone calm. ""My fiancée.""
Fiancée.
The word hung in the air like an accusation. I felt the ground shift beneath me, my hands gripping the edge of the counter to steady myself. He hadn't just moved on-he had built an entirely new life without me.
""That's nice,"" I said flatly, barely glancing at her. ""Do you need anything? Coffee? Pastries?""
Daniel hesitated, his eyes lingering on me. ""I didn't expect to find you here,"" he said, ignoring my question. ""I just arrived into town now and someone directed me to this cafe, but I didn't know it was yours.""
""I've been running it for six years,"" I replied, keeping my tone neutral.
He gave a small smile, the kind that once would have made my heart flutter. ""I always knew you'd open a place like this. You talked about it all the time.""
I didn't reply, my hands busy arranging cups and plates as if the conversation wasn't shaking me to my core.
""And your husband?"" he asked suddenly, his voice dipping.
I froze for a moment but didn't look up. ""That's none of your business."" But a second thought occurred to me, ""How does he know about my husband? Or that I was married?""
His jaw tightened, but before he could say more, his gaze shifted to Mark, who was now busy scribbling on a napkin. ""You have a very handsome son.""
My chest tightened. I forced a sharp breath through my nose and turned back to him. ""If you don't need anything else, Daniel, please you should leave. I have customers to attend to.""
The blonde woman-Elena-laughed softly, her perfectly manicured hand resting on Daniel's arm. ""We should go, Daniel. You have that meeting, remember?""
He hesitated for a moment, his gaze still on me, but then nodded. ""Goodbye, Amelia.""
I didn't respond.
As they left, I finally allowed myself to exhale. My hands trembled slightly as I busied myself with the espresso machine. Six years. He had disappeared without a word, leaving me to pick up the pieces of my life. And now, here he was, parading his perfect fiancée in front of me as if those years had never happened.
The café was quiet that evening. The last of the customers had left, and Mark was tucked away in the back room, coloring while I cleaned up. I hummed softly to myself, wiping down the tables and chairs, trying to shake off the tension that had lingered since Daniel's visit.
The bell jingled, breaking the silence.
I turned, expecting a late-night customer. Instead, Daniel walked in again, this time alone.
""What are you doing here?"" I asked sharply, my heart immediately on edge.
His shoulders were tense, his face etched with something I couldn't quite place-regret? Sadness? Guilt?
""Amelia,"" he began, his voice softer now. ""I need to talk to you.""
I folded my arms, keeping my distance. ""We have nothing to talk about. So please...."".
""Yes, we do,"" he said firmly, stepping closer.
""Daniel, whatever this is, just leave. I don't have time for-""
He cut me off again by placing a stack of documents on the counter between us.
""What is this?"" I asked, my stomach twisting.
""Just look at it,"" he said, his voice low.
I hesitated, but something in his expression made me pick up the papers. The words blurred for a moment as I skimmed the pages, my pulse quickening with each line.
When the meaning finally registered, my breath caught. I looked up at him, my voice barely a whisper. ""Is this a joke?""
""I wish it was,"" he said, his face clouded with guilt.
My hands shook as I clutched the papers. This wasn't just about him. This was about me-my café, my sanctuary, my home. Everything I had built for myself and for Mark.
""You're demolishing my café? How? Why?"" I finally choked out, my voice cracking.
He didn't answer, but the look in his eyes said it all.
I stared at him, a storm of emotions crashing over me-anger, betrayal, disbelief. The man who had abandoned me, the man behind my pain, the man who had left me to fend for myself, was now threatening to destroy the one thing I had left.
""Why?"" I demanded, my voice rising. ""Why are you doing this? Do you hate me this much?""
""Amelia, it's not that simple-""
""It's not simple?"" I snapped, my anger bubbling to the surface. ""You walk back into my life after six years, pretend like nothing happened, and now you're telling me you're taking away the only thing I have left?""
""Amelia, I didn't know this was your café,"" he said, his voice strained.
I laughed bitterly. ""Of course, you didn't. Why would you? I don't expect you to! You don't know anything about me anymore.""
He opened his mouth to respond, but I held up a hand, cutting him off. ""Leave, Daniel. Just leave.""
For a moment, he didn't move, his eyes filled with something I couldn't decipher.
But just before he left I said in a loud voice filled with determination, ""I'm not that naive, timid girl you left, so don't think I'll sit back and watch you take my cafe away from me"".
Then, without another word, he turned and walked out, the bell jingling softly behind him.
I sank into a chair, the documents clutched in my hands. My sanctuary, my refuge-it was all at risk. And the man who had broken my heart was the one holding the wrecking ball.
The fight I thought I had left behind was far from over.
Amelia's POV
The following morning, the café felt heavier, as though the walls themselves were aware of the looming threat. I forced myself into autopilot, greeting customers with my usual smile and keeping my hands busy with the endless tasks of running Blueberry Café. But inside, I was unraveling.
I hadn't slept all night. Daniel's face, his words, and those documents played on a loop in my mind, nonstop refusing to give me peace. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Mark's innocent smile and wondered how I would tell him his home-the café he had grown up in-was at risk.
""Mom, look!"" Mark's voice pulled me from my thoughts.
I turned to see him holding up a picture he'd drawn. ""It's our café,"" he explained proudly, pointing to the tiny details-a steaming coffee cup in the window, our names scribbled on the awning.
""That's amazing, sweetheart,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. My throat tightened as I looked at the picture. Mark's little world was built around this place, and I couldn't let it crumble.
The bell jingled, and my heart jumped. For a brief moment, I feared it was Daniel again, but instead, it was Mrs. Edith, one of my regulars. She smiled warmly as she made her way to her usual seat by the window.
""Good morning, dear,"" she said, her tone as cheerful and bright as ever.
""Morning, Mrs. Edith,"" I replied, then added in a cheerful tone, ""Your usual?""
She nodded as I went to the counter and started pouring her usual cup of chamomile tea.
""Are you alright, Amelia? You look pale,"" she asked, her sharp eyes scanning my face.
""I'm fine,"" I lied.
""I know you Amelia, what's wrong? You can talk to me"".
I wanted to talk but then I stopped and said with a big fake smile, spreading across my face. ""I'm fine, really!""
Her gaze lingered, but she didn't press further. I busied myself with preparing pastries, grateful for the distraction.
As the morning wore on, the usual hustle and bustle of the café did little to ease the tension in my chest. My mind kept drifting back to the documents. The demolition order was stamped with the bold insignia of Carter Enterprises-a company I now knew Daniel was at the helm of.
The thought made my stomach churn. How could he not have known? Was this some cruel coincidence, or was it deliberate? I needed answers, but confronting him again felt like inviting more chaos into my already fragile world.
By the time the café cleared out for the lunch lull, I was no closer to figuring out what to do. I sat at the counter, staring blankly at the stack of receipts in front of me, when the door swung open.
My head snapped up, and my heart sank. Daniel.
This time, he wasn't alone. Two men in suits flanked him, their briefcases and solemn expressions setting off alarm bells in my head.
""What now?"" I demanded, standing as he approached the counter.
""We need to talk,"" Daniel said, his voice calm but firm.
""I told you yesterday, there's nothing to talk about.""
One of the men stepped forward, clearing his throat. ""Ms. Hayes, I'm Mr. Whitaker, legal counsel for Carter Enterprises. We're here to discuss the terms of the proposed acquisition.""
""Acquisition?"" I repeated, my voice rising. ""This isn't a negotiation! This is my café, my home. You can't just take it!""
Daniel raised a hand to silence Mr. Whitaker, his gaze locked on mine. ""Amelia, please. Let me explain.""
""I don't want your explanations,"" I snapped. ""I want you to leave.""
""Mom?"" Mark's small voice cut through the tension.
I turned to see him standing in the doorway to the back room, clutching his drawing. His eyes darted between me and Daniel, confusion written all over his face.
Daniel's expression softened as he looked at Mark. There it was again-that flicker of recognition, the unspoken question I had been dreading.
""Mark, go back to your room,"" I said quickly, my voice firmer than I intended.
""But, Mom-""
""Now,"" I insisted, my heart racing.
Mark hesitated before retreating, his little shoulders slumped.
Daniel turned back to me, his face pale. ""Amelia...is he-?""
""Don't,"" I warned, my voice trembling.
He took a step closer, his eyes searching mine. ""Is he my son?""
The room seemed to tilt, the weight of his question pressing down on me like a tidal wave. My heart pounded in my chest as I fought to keep my composure.
""You have no right to ask me that,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper.
""I have every right,"" he shot back, his calm demeanor slipping. ""If he's mine-""
""He's mine,"" I interrupted, my voice sharp. ""You lost any right to ask that question the day you walked out of my life or have you forgotten?""
Before he could respond, the second man stepped forward, holding out a document. ""Ms. Hayes, we need your signature on this to proceed.""
I snatched the paper from his hand, my eyes scanning the text. My blood ran cold as I realized what it was-an agreement to vacate the premises within thirty days.
""No,"" I said firmly, tearing the paper in half. ""I'm not signing anything. You can take your lawyers and your demolition plans and get out.""
Daniel sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. ""Amelia, you're making this harder than it needs to be. I'm trying to take it easy but you're pushing it. You will be rewarded handsomely for it....""
""Harder?"" I repeated, my voice rising. ""You must really have the nerves to come here and claim the victim"".
I walked closer to him then whispered into his ear, ""I will not let you take my cafe away from me!""
The door jingled again, and I turned to see Mrs. Edith standing there, her face a mix of curiosity and concern.
""Everything alright, dear?"" she asked, her eyes darting between me and Daniel.
I forced a tight smile. ""Everything's fine, Mrs. Edith. We're just closing up for the afternoon.""
Daniel glanced at her, then back at me. ""This isn't over, Amelia.""
""No, it isn't,"" I replied, my voice cold.
He nodded to his lawyers, and they all filed out, leaving the café heavy with the aftermath of their presence.",1,1755651290.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

You might have seen my posts already over the last day or so. I've been laying out everything I've learned on this journey—a 5-part series covering the core philosophy, the paradoxes, and the techniques. I've explored the theory from every angle. But theory is one thing, and consistent, tangible results are another.

After all that study, I've realized I'm in the exact position that so many of us find ourselves in: knowing everything, but not truly applying it in a way that sticks.

Recently, I read an incredible success story here that hit me like a ton of bricks. The author described a point in their journey that felt like I was reading a page from my own diary. It was this paragraph:

""...if I wanted to manifest something, I would have to brute force it by 'locking in' meaning affirming every fucking day for up to 1-3 month... I am NOT manifesting free coffee over here, I am manifesting houses, cars and lump sums of money. But when it came to the partner - no amount of affirming was going to do shit. I could bring him with affirming but not keep him... I even tried working on Self concept and all that shit but nothing was sticking.""

This is me. For years, I've been trying to brute-force my desires into existence—specifically, a happy and stable relationship with the person I want, financial freedom, and fixing a physical insecurity. The process has become a cycle of hope and exhaustion. Affirming for the person I want became both my safe place and my personal hell.

The author of that post found their way out by discovering the ""I AM"" state, a state of just BEING, and letting everything flow from there. It's a beautiful and powerful path.

But it also made me realize something. I'm different. My mind is wired for intensity and focus. So, what if I took the same ""brute force"" energy that I was wasting on separate desires, and aimed it at the ultimate target?(Either instant manifestation,manifest affirming once,god state or void state,I chose void)

My New Challenge: The Brute-Force Assault on the Void

I've decided to stop affirming for my individual desires. I'm tired of the loop. Instead, I'm going all-in on a single objective: entering the Void State (the TRUE I AM State).

The logic is simple: Why spend months brute-forcing a single desire when I can spend that same time and energy brute-forcing my way into the control room, from where all creation is instant?

This is my plan:

The Single Affirmation: My only robotic affirmation during the day will be focused on the Void. Something direct and powerful like, ""I always enter the void when I fall asleep.""

The Nightly Tool: I will be listening to a Void State subliminal every single night, without fail.

The Discipline: I work a full day, Monday to Friday. To ensure maximum focus, I'm leaving my phone at home. Every spare moment of mental energy I have during the day will be dedicated to my single affirmation. No distractions. No checking the 3D for my old desires.

I'm not trying to ""be."" I'm using my natural tendency to ""do"" and ""brute-force"" as the very tool to get me to a state where I no longer have to do anything.

I don't know if this will take a week or three months, but like the author of that post, I'm tired of the old way. It's time to find the easier path, even if it requires one last, focused battle to get there.

I'm putting this out there to hold myself accountable and to share a different approach. Maybe this resonates with some of you who also feel stuck in the ""grind.""

I'll be back to post the results. Wish me luck.",1,1755651269.0,NevilleGoddard,0,1.0,False

I (29M) was on a flight home and the woman sitting behind me kept putting her bare fucking feet in my space. I told her to knock it off, and with some grumbling, she did. However, only minutes later, her foot ended up near me again, so I scolded her again. Third time it happened I told her I was going to tell the stewardess if she didn't stop putting her foot there. She did it again so naturally I involved the stewardess. All the lady did was tell this woman nicely to keep her feet to herself, and lo and behold, she didn't learn her lesson because right beside was her stank foot!

Inspired by a video where someone decided to let a passenger's (lukewarm) coffee fall onto them so that they'd learn a lesson about not leaving their drink precariously balanced, as we were about to disembark, I engulfed her pinky toe in my mouth and with one motion bit straight through, biting her toe off.

Everybody kept asking who was responsible for this. In order to keep the suspicion off me, I had given a small child (ironically better behaved than this grown woman) some raspberries to eat so that he'd have red stains on his teeth. To get away from the scene faster, I legged it away from the airport instead of entering the building and going through security.

I'm asking this because I decided to encase the toe in resin and display it as a symbol of my accomplishment but my wife isn't comfortable with me showing this much interest in another woman's toe. I've explained to her that there's nothing sexual about it and I'd never be so heinous as to cheat on her, but I'm willing to throw the toe in the trash if she really has this much of an issue with it.",0,1755651117.0,AITAH,3,0.33,False

I don't hate you as much as I hate you. That sounds dumb, but it's true. You were awful to me in ways I'll probably never fully forgive, but l'd also be lying if I said there weren't good moments. It wouldn't be fair to pretend those didn't exist. We had laughter, coffee runs, stupid little memories that were real. And that's part of what makes this all sting so much more because for a minute, I believed in you.

I'm sorry I blocked you. I told you to let go of your ego and your pride and then I continued to be egotistical and impractical and that really doesn't feel right. But the truth is I'm still hurt by things you'll probably never understand, not now, maybe not ever. And that's the part I've had to accept.

You'll never feel what I felt, you'll never live what I lived in that apartment. That time is gone, and the trajectory of it can't be rewritten. Unfortunately, I fear I may never forgive you because the only phone numbers I know by heart are my parents and yours.
Your brother moving in was the beginning of the end, whether either of us admitted it or not. The six-month agreement became something else, and honestly? That revealed more about who you were than you realized. At best, you were careless. At worst, you were cruel. 

Either way, those aren't people I want to share a home or a life with. Here's the thing though, you are a good person in many ways. You're smart, kind, generous. But those qualities didn't come through in you as a boyfriend. They just didn't. And I can't partner with someone whose defining traits in a relationship are ""careless"" at best and
""cruel"" at worst.

I don't want that in my life. I don't want it near my future kids. That isn't in the story l'm writing for myself. There is a good man within you. Please stop wasting energy fighting for me and fight for that man. That's the only fight that matters now J.

I miss you like hell. Every single day. I can't even tell you how much I miss you. I mean, I can. I've just been choosing not to because I think it's better for both of us if I don't. But I miss you and I hate the way that it's been raining lately because that makes me just miss you more.

I hope you're OK. Even if you're not, I hope you get OK eventually. I love you. I mean that. But I don't miss being your girlfriend. Loving someone shouldn't make you feel scared and miserable. and as much as I love you, my love and self-respect for myself have to be bigger than that right now. I hope I can figure out how to do that soon enough.

So this is me saying the things I needed to say: I don't hate you as much as I hate you. I don't wish you ill. But I don't want you in my life. It had to happen. But i miss you anyway.",2,1755651093.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

My brothers are all pigs. We had a very traditional house where girls cleaned and washed dishes from the time, we were old enough to walk and stand on chairs and my brothers never did anything and as adults cannot even turn a washer on. I very much resenting how I felt like I had to raise my own father and how holidays and weekends were always spent with my brothers and dads laying around and us cleaning. Even Christmas they got to play with their toys and we went in the kitchen. I do not care about excuses like ""I was never taught"", we are all adults now and they can YouTube and google whatever they do not know. I learned how to patch walls, change tiers, change oil, etc. All the gendered stuff I was never taught so I do not see why he can't as well. My brother got put out by his girlfriend after they just had their first kid because he does not help with anything.

Since staying with me I have forced him to do stuff. When he first moved in my house went from my tidy, clean utopia to a disgusting mess. He would spit sunflower seeds on the flood, hide his food and dirty dishes around the house, spit chewed gum behind the coffee machine feet from the trash can, hide snack food everywhere, smoke on the toilet and put cigs out on my floor (which is a slap in the face as I asked him to not even smoke inside because I do not smoke), leave his dirty clothes everywhere even on the living room floor, etc. Even when he ordered food for himself, he would eat at the table then leave it for me to put away for him. Anytime he took anything out of the fridge he would leave it on the table and would often leave the fridge open. I am not joking, I found maggots 3 times from his mess.

I lost it and told him to change his behavior totally or get out. Well, he started doing stuff but as badly as he could. He would put bowls in the dish washer so they would be filled with nasty water, mop with the same water for days on end leaving it smelling of rot, do his laundry by putting it in the washer and leaving it for me to finish, put food away by throwing it all over the fridge spilling food everywhere. The best was when he put the syrup away upside down on the top shelf with no lid on coating my entire fridge in syrup that took hours to clean, etc. Then he would say ""I am trying you are just being a b&tch"".

I lost my temper, and I know I couldn't leave him on the street, so I divided the house. The cabinet doors all have locks from the previous owners, so I got him from dishes from goodwill and forbad him from using any of my dishes so he is eating off his filthy dishes. I made it very clear that anything left on the floors (clothing, etc) gets a one-day grace period then it will be thrown away. Same with the few dishes he has as he would leave them in the sink until they started to grow mold. I started locking my bathroom door and he has to use the one in the basement which I refuse to clean. If his clothes are in the washer for more than 8 hours and I need to use it, I dump them wet on his bed. Any trash he leaves laying around goes on his bed. If he orders food and gets up and leaves his leftovers, I leave them to rot, then they get thrown away (though twice the idiot has left food out overnight and came out and started angry eating it whilst glaring at me. Both times the idiot got food sickness). He destroyed my fridge again putting juice in upside down with the lid barely on once again destroying my food, so I mopped it up with towels and dumped the towels and all my ruined food on his bed then put a lock on the fridge.

He hates me and says I am terrorizing him. I say I was forced to mother him as a child but was never given the parental control to actually teach him how life works. And since my brothers used my childhood to treat me like a maid, I will no longer parent them. My view is, some lessons have to be learned painfully. I will not gentle parent a grown man who cannot close a fridge door. ATIAH?",1,1755651089.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I get this overwhelming sense of doom when I’m talking to people. You could almost think of it as palpable, or feel it in the air - the feeling of the sky about to drop on you and you wouldn’t even know what hit ya. It gets … loud. 

The conversation could be with a family member, or it could be a completely random person (though it usually happens more with randoms).

It usually starts to “build” right at the beginning of a conversation. If I’m just thinking about a conversation or meeting, it will start right before. 

Symptoms leading up to and during:
	•	My face gets flush, almost like I’ve been running around
	•	Breathing quickens
	•	I have a hard time making eye contact with whoever I’m talking to
	•	I get fidgety (take multiple sips of water, check my notebook like I’m cross-referencing something, or add random notes from the meeting)
	•	I stumble over my words the longer the conversation goes on

Sometimes I try to maintain eye contact, but I think it comes across more like I’m glaring at people. My eyes also feel like they have sand in them so any bright light really throws a wrench at me and makes it 10x worse. 

Before, I used to let this feeling stop me from doing activities or holding meetings at work. Now I just force myself to do it and stumble through.

Stats for context:
•	Weight: 260 lbs (down 20lbs since January 2025)
•	Height: 6’3”
•   Eating more home cooked meals and when I’m out on the road it’s more booster juice wraps and smoothies. 
• Cardio three times a week.
• One cup of coffee a day / maybe two If I’m at the house. 
•Used to drink throughout the week, now I might have two-five beer socially in 2 months since the start of the year.

I honestly hate hate HATE this feeling, but don’t know where to go from here.

Soy de esas personas que no pueden empezar el día sin una buena taza de café. Durante años he estado saltando de marca en marca, siempre con la sensación de que faltaba algo… ya sabéis, ese café que no solo te despierta, sino que te hace disfrutar de verdad del momento.

Hace poco me pasó algo curioso: estaba hablando con un amigo sobre lo difícil que es encontrar un café que sea bueno de verdad, sin tanto marketing vacío detrás, y me recomendó que probara Apukuna Coffee.

Al principio pensé que sería “otro café más”, pero cuando me llegó el pedido me sorprendió desde el primer momento. El aroma al abrir la bolsa ya era distinto, fresco, intenso… y cuando lo preparé en mi cafetera italiana, fue como un antes y un después. Notas de chocolate, un toque frutal, y sobre todo esa sensación de estar bebiendo algo auténtico y recién tostado.

La verdad es que me impresionó tanto que sentí que tenía que compartirlo aquí. Si eres de los que disfrutan el café de especialidad o simplemente quieres dar el salto a algo mejor que el café industrial del súper, te recomiendo echar un vistazo a su web.

REASEARCH THEM. RESEARCH THEM. 
THIS IS NOT AN OVER REACTION. 

Shameful company and shameless leadership/executives. Mismanagement, incompetence, liars, theives. See the Sticky in this sub, then ask all of us pre-orderers about the Spectrum Black 32” Hub  + plus any other preorder folks how they have stolen over a $1200 USD from each of us. Then ask someone stupid like me that knew the poo’d the bed on their last company (changed their name like a grade A scam artist) to lure and hook an apparently stupid person like me (well played, I didn’t think you could run your scam twice…touché). Then, like a teenager whose mom typically saves the day when they screw up— they ghost their own customers after committing to refunds. 

The latest for me - reached out to customer service in March 2025 initially to cancel my Scamtron Black 32” Hub PREORDER. (I have now followed up about 5 times on subsequent refund requests via customer service - responses promise they mean well and they are going to refund/credit me). Over $1200 stolen, and pre-release discounts which they also committed to refund/credit down to their lower price offers…weird, stolen also. 

This company has scammed & stolen their customers out of what has been confirmed by their own financial reporting what equates to millions of $$$.  Change your name again - hide and cower after your scams. BEWARE!!!  THEY LIE, STEAL and COMMIT BUSINESS FRAUD - over a cup of coffee and morning scrolling. Also have stolen their customers’ self-respect. The worst kind of fraudulent and scummy behavior. There is a case study and documentary happening live, each day this company is in business; rivaling Bernie Madoff. YOU ARE SLEEZE. Start selling Vultures and Leaches - it fits your company culture better, maybe you’d be successful there. 

Oh, the stench of sleeze that this company excretes at a hourly pace…. It could fill the Grand Canyon, and then pile up to reach higher than the Burj Khalifa.  Scam artists and theives, who have successfully veiled their scammy, money stealing scheme behind their inauthentic over-communication and disingenuous engagement with customers in this forum — lulling all of us into a false sense of security.  They changed their company name, watch them do it again.

I had seen this coworker around but never actually conversed with him before. A few days ago, we both were assigned together to complete a task and so we spoke for a few hours.

I am 20F and he is probably around 35-40M. Right off the bat, he was asking all kinds of seemingly harmless but personal questions like how old I am, what is my religion, etc. Honestly I didn't think too much of these questions as it seemed like he was just being friendly and trying to get to know me. He seemed very eager and excited to be speaking with me.

He then told me of this concert that he was planning on inviting me to along with several other coworkers. I started to think to myself, ""wow, he is being incredibly friendly."" He made some flirty comments but I just ignored it because I just couldn't imagine him looking at me in that way considering my age.

Less than 15 min later, he said he wanted to invite me to get coffee together. In all honesty, I still really just thought he was being friendly, so I accepted. I also didn't think he was seriously thinking about hanging out, I thought we were generally just saying we will get a coffee together at some point. I also was still processing what was going on, I didn't realize how creepy this is until some time later. He asked for my number, and I assumed this was normal because I had exchanged numbers with several other coworkers (and it seems like this is common in this workplace), so I gave it to him.

At this point, toward the end of the interaction, I started feeling some sort of shift in energy, and I could tell he was attracted to me. I decided to wait to see whether I was misconstrueing the whole situation, but one day later, he texted me asking how I was doing. I answered him with a pretty basic reply so I don't lead him on. He then started talking about the exact date we will get coffee (note that this is will be entirely one-on-one and off-hours). His eagerness and him taking initiative like this made me realize that he thought we were going on a date. I started feeling very uncomfortable, considering how much older is he is compared to me, along with the fact that he acts like my dad. I feel like him inviting me to so many different things within just a few hours of properly meeting me is a red flag as well.

There's no concrete evidence that he views this as a date, and so I don't know how to reject him. He is also my superior so I am worried that he will retaliate against me. Because he is behaving unprofessionally and doesn't seem bothered by me being uncomfortable, I decided that he doesn't deserve any respect from me either, so I just fully ghosted him now. The problem is that I saw him again yesterday and he asked me whether I saw his text, to which I replied saying I was busy. I just feel like he is very pushy. But now I wonder whether I am an asshole for ghosting him, I just feel like this is highly inappropriate because he's so old compared to me. I ghosted him because he was giving me major creepy vibes, and so I wanted to know if other people also feel that he is creepy.",2,1755650368.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

I am interested in moving to your city. In this post I will give you facts about myself, how my life is lived and hopes and dreams i've had for a decade.

I am 31 years old and have only ever lived in my small home town (NS), Halifax and where I am now, Charlottetown. I am a transgender woman and have been for multiple years. I have my full male body and will not be going on HRT or getting any gender reassignment surgery, this is something that is very uncommon, at least in the years I have been transgender, I have not met another person like me. So, if you can picture a muscular while still petite male body, very smooth skin, long brown hair with brown eyes, big butt and very fashionable, that's me! I have only ever worked in retail or in a kitchen dishwashing. I have tried for about 15 years to get a job as a waitress or bartender but have never been given the chance. I have always dreamed of having a job like this as I am a very people friendly person.

When it comes to how I live, I'm very lonely, I have never had an adult romantic relationship, I also do not have a single friend. There is no family in the province I live in and I hate my job. I do not want to go back to NS, the only place worth living is Halifax and while I did that before and enjoyed it, it's time to try at my dream. ESPECIALLY, go somewhere not a single person knows me and finally have a fresh start, finally try and get myself into a situation where I can finally have a friend, or go on my first date as an adult.

And yes, as you can imagine, for my decade long dream, I do want to dance, yes, the type of dance that your city gets to claim as the Canada capital for this type of dance. I have had this dream ever since I came out of the closet, 10 years ago. I truly believe that if I was given a chance and I was able to do this dance the way I imagine, I would thrive. I am only into girls and all of my dances that I come up with in my mind is designed and choreographed for a woman with the body of a man, giving a dance to a woman (as the left say, cis-gender) as in very romantic and passionate. 

So, questions for the lovely people of Montreal...

1) How is the cost for a small studio, bachelor, 1 bedroom apartment?

2) How is it for a dancer in Montreal that does this dance? Are there transgender women doing this? Would I be the first (or just the first with my body)?

3) Is there a market for a transgender female dancer of this nature that keeps her male body?

4) Would I be able to make friends? Like, actual adult friends for the first time in my life where we hang out and go out for supper, coffee shops, shopping, movies, in our apartments and doing sporty stuff?

5) Will I have any luck at finding true love?

6) DO I NEED TO LEARN FRENCH!?

7) Can I get a job as a waitress, or bartender at a small restaurant if need me and work my way up? (French in mind).

8) How much should I have saved before I make the move? If I have enough do I need a job lined up or can I just move there? 

9) Are there way too many far protests and activists going around?

10) What's your immigration like? How many? Maybe there's a key demographic for your immigrants?

11) HOW IS THE FASHION!? I'M TIRED OF SEEING PEOPLE WALKING AROUND IN PJ BOTTOMS AND SLIPPERS WITH A TANK TOP IN THE GROCERY STORE, please, i'm ALWAYS all dolled up. You never now when you bump into the King. (That's just the mindset you should have for how you dress).

I hope the lovely people of Montreal can help me, i'm at my wits end, I really need to start living for myself. Hope to give you a dance sometime in the future.",0,1755650097.0,montreal,6,0.2,False

i walked in, said i was here for a job interview, and was taken to a little room where the 3 managers were already there, prepped with notebooks/laptops for interviews. they interviewed me, and i felt like i gave a pretty good interview. 

a week passes, and i get an email saying, “hey [my name]! just want to check-in, we had an interview with you last week, correct?”

i replied with, “yes, i interviewed on tuesday the 12th at 3:30! thanks for checking in. i’m looking forward to hearing from you again about this job opportunity”. i go by a different name than my legal name, so i thought that he was double checking that my email address was right or something like that. that interviewer that emailed me kept calling me by my legal name throughout the interview, so i just thought he was really confused by it. 

the manager didn’t reply to that email. instead, i got an automated email from google calendar saying that my job interview for tuesday the 19th at 3:30 was canceled. that’s when i realized, a week later, that i showed up to a job interview on the wrong day.

Yesterday I go in with my cousin, I see her in the walk up side as we pull in, then we get to the drive through window, I’m looking inside to see if I see her for about 5-10 seconds from the passenger side, I’m not focusing directly in front  of me but when I don’t see her, I look and I see 3 girls whispering, smiling and looking at me, I half smiled back and then we left. Even my cousin mentioned the girls so it wasn’t just me. 

I’m just confused because she said yes, clarified it was me who followed her on Friday, Saturday I ask her to hangout, doesn’t accept my request by Sunday 11am ish so I just canceled it because my buddy said she would have followed by now if she was actually interested. 

So…she told her co workers but doesn’t follow me back or respond to my message? Do I just find a new coffee spot?

We're moving to a new apartment within the neighborhood at the end of the month and are selling some items. We're not taking most of them because our new unit is partly furnished.

[Tracey Boyd Chelsea 2-Piece Steel & Wicker Patio Chair Set](https://www.athome.com/tracey-boyd-chelsea-2-piece-steel-wicker-patio-chair-set/124315785.html#reviews-info) - $75
Used this set for around two years. Kept under a tarp during the winter months but there is some natural wear and tear from being exposed to the outdoors. We kept the cushions inside when not using it, so they are in pretty good condition except for some small staining on one from where it lay against the back of the chair after it rained. These chairs are incredibly comfortable and we're sad to part with them! Also including a small table that we purchased separately from At Home as well.

[IKEA Kivik Sofa in Gunnared Blue](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/kivik-sofa-gunnared-blue-s69499704/#content) - $150
Used for three years. Covers can be taken off and washed. Can be partly disassembled for transport.

[Casper Original Hybrid Mattress with Adjustable Bedframe - Queen Size](https://casper.com/products/original-hybrid-v1) - $250
Used for three years. Had mattress protector on for the entire time, though there is a very, very small coffee stain on it. Adjustable bedframe is great if you like reading in bed! We thought it was kind of gimmicky at first but ended up using it almost every night. (Items available separately at $200 for the mattress and $50 for the adjustable bedframe.)

[Spaxton Black Accent Cabinet](https://www.roomstogo.com/furniture/product/spaxton-black-accent-cabinet/26071934) - $50
Used for seven years, mostly as a dresser. It's quite heavy but it looks nice!

Pickup only, but we are happy to help with moving the items out of our apartment and down to the street. We are located in the Gardens.

1mv04hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Electrical_Froyo7638/comments/1mv04hb/focused_45_day_2/,Focused 45: Day 2,"Algorithms are parasitic to consciousness. Youtube, Instagram and TikTok have morphed into digital parasites that feed off of their hosts awareness. Each reel that these parasitic content machines deliver are tailor made to their hosts likes and dislikes. They observe their host with god like attention and construct an algorithm specifically designed to keep its subject lulled into an attention rotting trance in order to expose them to as many advertisements as possible. 

In the digital age, awareness is the most valuable resource. It is not news to anyone that the quick dopamine content of reels and micro bursts of entertainment is corrosive to the psyche. The psychological literate surrounding this is abundantly clear. Fractured awareness is cancerous to our ability to focus. Our conscious attention is sacred. Our awareness literally IS us. We are consciousness. The soul is conscious. Therefore anything that deteriorates awareness deteriorates the soul. Now I am not taking a moralistic stance on reels, I only hope to highlight the harmfulness of how they will gladly feed on our fractured awareness. 

I am of the mind that human consciousness is the most precious phenomena in the known universe and that our souls are divinely inspired and have evolved to reflect the creative force of God that spoke the big bang into existence. Our attention should not be something we flippantly and unconsciously sacrifice to the algorithmic demigods of twitter and TikTok. Our attention, if harnessed properly is the universal principle of coherent order that can engineer spacecrafts, supercomputers and automobiles. It is the most sophisticated and world altering mechanism that has manifested in the known universe and every hour spent drowning in a TikTok algorithm is a slight against the creative force of human cognition. 

Our perceptual cognition is predicated on something called relevance realization.
Given the virtually limitless amount of incoming data that is possible to perceive at any moment, (like how many tiles are in the ceiling or the color arrangement on a coffee mug) our cognition is equipped with a function that filters out any data that is irrelevant and it highlights the data that is relevant. If I were to go into the kitchen to cook dinner, my mind automatically filters out everything that is irrelevant to the outcome of a warm bowl of spaghetti. Without my conscious awareness, my mind automatically filters out all other ingredients, kitchen ware and heating elements that are not relevant to me eating spaghetti. 

Relevance realization is only relevant if their is an intended goal, which in this case is cooking a bowl of spaghetti. 
This is why reels can be so toxic to psychological health, Because nothing is relevant within the realm of reels. Our awareness is getting rag dolled by a stream of information that dwarfs our ability to realize what is relevant. On the highest level of analysis, when we unconsciously engage with the informational swarm of the algorithm we sell our souls for a cheap hit of dopamine slop that leaves us feeling emptier than before we started swiping. 

Our phones are the new battle ground of the soul. We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against algorithms and artificial slop creatively designed to sell us shit that we don’t need. In the age age of information, sustained awareness is a direct act of rebellion. ",1,1755649857.0,u_Electrical_Froyo7638,0,1.0,False

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1mv02g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1mv02g7/2_weeks_post_xifaxan_starting_to_get_better_and/,"2 weeks post Xifaxan, starting to get better and see the light.","Hey all just wanted to provide some hope for this group. Hydrogen dominant + IBS-D

I had a SIBO relapse over the course of a few months. This was my second round of antibiotics 1.5 years after my last

I believe this relapse was due to a stressful month of moving homes, getting too comfortable eating whatever i want because I didn't have obvious sibo symptoms for awhile. I also believe that a few seasons before I had food poisoning it didnt entirely go away. When my body finally slowed down, every meal became painful again even low fodmap foods were not sitting right.

GI prescribed xifaxan. My 2 weeks on it were digestively aweful. I found myself fasting more than dealing with meals. weight dropped fast but no flu symptoms like others have mentioned in the past.

I thought it completely failed. My first few days post antibiotics were terrible, I was afraid to leave the house everything was digesting so bad but after the weekend things started to turn. I had the email drafted to my dr that this was a flop.

I tried to reintroduce some simple asian foods, it was not good, cramped like crazy. Immediately went back to low ferm/fodmap

But then it started...

My first sign was a sense of regularity returning was right after the weekend after my first week. Healthier stools, slightly more peaceful post meal digestion, and maybe the main improvement mental clarity and depression lifting. I had no idea that sibo was triggering any sense of depression just brain fog but its been very noticeable.

Each day has been progressively better, I really think I'm on a road to true recovery. I may even dine out tomorrow and eat something moderately fun with a friend. Each introduction the last few days (minus dairy, which i need to cut out) has been increasingly optimistic.

**A few things that have been part of my process:**

\+ I've been starting every morning with 10 minutes of intentional stretching. My fear is my desk job and bad posture are compressing my intestines, I want to try and start my days less compressed. Im not sure if this helps directly but it makes me feel better.

\+ I started taking AG1 after the first week when I didnt see signs of improvement. AG1 is a rip off cost wise but i've had good results with it in the past with my sibo case. I think its probiotics are unintentionally mild enough, reintroduces some vitamins and it really gets my motility rolling . I feel like it could flaire alot of people sibo please be cautious if you try it. I plan on continuing for the forseeable future.

\+ I take 1 motilpro tablet before bed. This gets me going as soon as I wake up in the morning wiht a cup of coffee. Its too harsh for me to have on an empty stomach or during the day.

\+ Black coffee first thing in the morning is a classic sibo trick to get the guts going. It's harsh but an absolute must for me

\+ I've been doing an old NYT 7 minute work out when I can. A full workout doesnt feel great but I find getting my heart rate up just enough in the day can keep my symptoms on the better side. Its almost like my intestines are dormant until i start some proper physical activity.

\+ I recently learned about iberogast. It seems incredibly effective for me. I eat it 30 minutes before a meal Im a bit more nervous about. As far as I can tell its keeping my gut in a very soothed state. I've only tried this twice but I've been impressed with the experience.

\+ One odd thing is my body is not responding well to smaller meals, Im getting better motility if I have a larger heavier meal the day before. Its a bit unusual as its normally the opposite.

\+ I had insane sugar cravings for 2 weeks. I never expereinced anything like it. I bit a gluten free muffin the other day and it felt orgasmic. It was truly bizzarre. I am now trying to cut out all sugar. My body seems to respond better to low ferm vs low fodmap, I fear I may have a level of sifo as well. So I am being mindful of feeding it as its probably making me crave it.

I hope this helps someone. Huge amounts of empathy for anyone going through this process.",2,1755649706.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

The Bucket List 

I don’t like heights 
I will never skydive or
Bungee jump or fly 
In a plane 

If I see Europe 
It will be by boat 
More likely is Disney world 
Or a trip to the coast

I no longer have to wake 
Before the rising of the sun 
Interactions are few throughout 
The course of the day and on
My terms 

I have my wife, my dogs, and
My land. I sit in comfort with 
Coffee in my hand. Taking my 
Time with no reason to rush 

Listening to news and the state 
Of the world, checking the calendar,
The weather, the deliveries and the mail.

Sundays become Thursdays
Days or dates, months go by,
Two years retired 

The rain goes away but the 
Grass grows wild, water our
Plants and run a few miles.

Think of the past and think 
Of the kids, visit your doctors 
And refill your meds.

Remember what you put off
Yesterday, fold the clothes and 
Put them away. Remembering if
This is our trash day.

Make a list, are we running low
On this and that. Better start the 
Truck before the battery goes dead,
Next oil change far ahead.

Seasons change and oak leaves fall 
Mulch and rake and close the pool
Summer clothes gone and sweaters out.
Sensitive to the cold as I grow old but
A respite from mosquitoes and horseflies.
Now, my markers of time are more seasonal 
and physical than professional or social. 


Cancer came to town but lived in one place 
Hormones are down, harder to finish the
Race- Alive Alive is all that counts, retire
Just to  die- too young for modern times.

Health is first on my bucket list, ninety is
Young if you can think, remember, stand 
And sit. For my wife as well, why should I be 
Alone with strangers when I would prefer being 
With my friend.

Inner peace and quiet, making peace with my 
Experiences of Life. Honing wisdom and ignoring strife,
Absence of turmoil, hatred, and fights. A good second 
On the bucket list.

Smiling and laughing with sarcastic expressive lyric
Delights, nothing is sacred, being offended inexistent.
Control what you want, control what you can, happy,
Happy, Happy man. To find meaning in the rhythms of a simple life
 — centered on Health, companionship, comfort, and peace.

Rushing no more, slow down and take pace 
No reason to contribute to the same old mistakes.
Slow down, enjoy, and take it all in. Dressed
By noon? Shower by ten. Just ordinary tasks,
Not drudgery, just another thread of the fabric 
Of life lived intentionally.

Make peace with death but don’t invite it in.
I won’t want to go unless the state of my body 
Demands it. I have had my time. Convoluted 
Times, strange times, honest and bipolar times.
2048 if my organs should last. It would truly be 
Selfish to play for more. Longevity is valued even 
more with independence, clarity, and life with a beloved partner.

Health and Peace, laughter and love, smiles from 
A happy face. Slow and wise in the absence of strife 
And stress. My friend to love which never ends, a quiet 
Existence. There is no such thing as a perfect Life. It won’t 
Be found in what you chase before you die, but in how 
You live while you are still here, savoring everyday contentment.
This, for me, is the perfect bucket list.

ABBA, the world's top selling pop group, have been together for ten fantastic, money-spinning years. They started out as two happily married couples who delighted in making music. But the on-stage harmony that brought Anni-Frid, Benny, Bjorn and Agnetha fame and fortune did not continue in their private lives. Both marriages ended in divorce. Three of the four have found new loves. What caused the discord? Yesterday in the most outspoken interviews ever, Bjorn and Agnetha told their stories. Today it is the turn of Benny and Anni-Frid ...

 

 

BENNY’S STORY

 

ANOTHER LIGHT: the heavy smoker (caption for Benny)

 

SUPERGROUP ABBA's co-songwriter Benny Andersson was a bundle of nerves.

His hands shook as he spoke of his wrecked marriage and he continually fidgeted with his cigarettes.

He said: ""I don't know how other people deal with this.

""Frida and I are still partners in ABBA. We are still friends-but we're just not partners in marriage anymore.""

His marriage to AnniFrid Lyngstad ended dramatically, according to friends.

""Benny just came home one day and said he had found another woman. Frida was devastated"", said someone close to the group.

 

Friends

 

The new woman in Benny's life is Mona Noerklit, a 37-year-old Swedish TV

personality.

Benny confirmed: ""Mona is my new companion. Call her that.

""Frida and I are still friends. I respect her and she respects me for what

we can do together musically.""

But that's not entirely true. There is obviously tension between them.

There is nothing like the laughter and cheer there used to be.

Benny is very nervous. Clearly he has come out the worst of the two.

""We did discuss whether the group would be able to stay together after our break-up,"" he said. ""But we figured that they had weathered the

break-up of Bjorn and Agnetha-so they could

handle ours as well.

""We decided to stick together for the sake of the music. After all, we enjoy what we do.""

You get the feeling when talking to Benny that he finds it increasingly difficult to find the motivation he needs to keep going. He said: ""Financially we no longer have any worries. And our dreams of superstardom have beaten our wildest imaginations.

""We like our musical results and as long as we do, we'll keep playing.

We'll stop when it's no longer fun.

""What we do is no workof art. I know we sell a helluva lot of records and

make an awful lot of money, but that really doesn't mean much.

""I enjoy creating the music-making a tune out of thin air.

""We never imagined we'd get to be as big as we are. After all, we're just ordinary people living rather ordinary lives.

""We go to work in the morning, eat out a couple of nights a week, go boating on weekends.

""I guess all this happened in spite of ourselves.""

Like the other members of the group, Benny sees the end of ABBA

approaching.

He gives them another two years or another two albums.

""I can't imagine myself as a potbellied man of forty-five dancing around on stage,"" he said.

""The ABBA sound is the girls. They're the ones you hear.

""Bjorn and I may create the words, but the girls are the ones who make the sound.

""Take them away and you have no more ABBA.""

With the most recent ABBA album, Super trouper, selling millions all over the world, it's interesting that Benny feels the biggest change in their music has been the advance of technology-not swing forwards lyrics with more sophistication.

As Benny and I parted company, he having consumed three cups of coffee and half a pack of cigarettes in the two hours we talked, he summed up his feelings about ABBA

Power

I don't think we have any power as individuals ""he said. ""I'm not even sure we have any power as a group. Nobody would buy a Volvo because ABBA says buy a Volvo.

We're basically family people with strong family backgrounds.

We got together ten years ago to perform and have done just that for more than a decade now.

We're not the angels some have made us out to be.

We are normal people with all the problems that normal, ordinary people hve.

But In addition to being those people we also happen to be a group called ABBA.""

 

 

FRIDA'S STORY

 

TREND-SETTER:  Young girls rush to copy Anni-Frid’s flame-red hairdo

 

THERE'S a new man in the life of recently divorced Anni-Frid of ABBA. But she's keeping him a mystery.

. She has, however, introduced him to ex-husband Benny, and they’re all friends, says Frida.

The flame-haired beauty denies that her new lover is her chauffeur Lars Blomberg, as reported in several newspapers. He is a rich Swedish businessman,

""I've learned from my mistakes in the past,"" she said. ""I don't want my new man facing all the publicity and the questions and that's why I'm keeping his name a secret.”

""But you can tell everyone that I'm in love and Frida has a new fella. He's not in this business and I love that.”

""He's a part of my life, but I realize now that it's important to develop Interests outside showbusiness.""

With two children from her failed first marriage, Hans, now 18, and Liselotte, 14, and a failed second marriage to Benny, Frida understandably said: ""Marriage is no longer important to me. Love is. We'll have to see what happens.""

What about more children?

""Mine are already grown up,"" she said. ""I'm not sure I want to begin again.""

Benny and Frida announced their divorce in February and within six weeks, the new man in Frida's life surfaced.

""Now that Benny and I have broken up,"" she said, ""we're able to work together better. Our relationship is calmer and more relaxed. Benny and I are good friends, and we really do like each other.

""There is nothing sad about it. We've just grown apart because of our different interests in life.

""We have always been honest with one another. We talked and talked and talked and finally agreed that a divorce was the only answer.""

The Immediate reason for the break-up, though, was that after nine years of living together and four years of marriage, Benny found another woman. It was when he broke that news to Frida that the talk and then the split-up occurred.

According to a close friend: ""It came out of the blue and hit her like a thunderbolt.

""There was a lot of crying and talking, but once he had told her, there was no turning back, a break-up was unavoidable.""

Frida is the most publicity shy of all of ABBA. More than any of the others, she feels she's been victimized by false, distorted and fabricated stories.

""The way people think of us has a lot to do with their imaginations and very little to do with us as people,"" she said.

""They just see the surface; they don't have an in-depth view of us as people. They see only the bright side, the way we dress, the way we act, the things all those made-up stories say.

 

Secure

 

""When I first started, I thought I'd like to get an audience to know me as a person. Their picture of me was so wrong.

""But it doesn't bother me any longer. I feel safe and secure in who I am. I don't have the need to tell everybody anymore.

""I would have reached this point eventually, but being in love again sure helps.""

As a young girl of thirteen, Frida dreamed of being a big star. She had the first glimmer of hope that it would one day be true, when ABBA recorded their first album.

""Now she is a superstar, a trend-setter who inspires young girls all across Sweden to go to their hairdressers asking for a wild, flame-red hairdo Just like Frida's.

She started coloring it years ago and it's got redder and redder.

But things weren't so rosy at the start of ABBA'S career.

""The first time we performed together as a group was in 1971 at a local restaurant,"" Frida said.

""We were horrible. The crowd hated us and we thought maybe we were crazy.""

Now of course ABBA Is world famous but, ironically, even though ABBA in the past six years alone have chalked up worldwide record sales of £260 million, making each member of the group a multi-millionaire, Frida still worries about money.

""Once a month we have a board meeting to discuss our investments,"" she said. ""All our decisions must be unanimous. And I worry about making the right

ones.

In the early days when Frida was married to Ragnar Frederiksson-the marriage that produced her two children-she seemed headed for a traditional life as a wife and mother.

She did a little singing in the evenings at local cabarets, but her life was mostly her family.

She said: ""I could never have kept travelling down that road.""

We talked frankly for two days. ""I'm taking a chance,"" she said ""But maybe this time people will know the real me.""

You get the feeling that Frida still wants her audience to know the truth about her as a person-the real in-depth story.",3,1755649406.0,ABBA,0,1.0,False
1muzy8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1muzy8g/my_friends_are_leaving_me_but_i_dont_care_anymore/,"My friends are leaving me, but I don't care anymore","Hi, first of all sorry for this long post, it's a lot to take out, secondly, for very private reasons I'm leaving all personal details out of this, including names for which I will use fake ones, and lastly english is not my first language, so be mindful if i made any mistake, I'm not fluent yet.

Last year I had an amazing group of friends, but the most personal friends I had were Jeff and Denna (both are related as cousins, but im not related to them), I'm 2 and 3 years older than them respectively and knew them for like ever and go to the same college. We had a lot of friends meet ups and parties together (not even real parties, mostly moments at our homes drawing, eating and playing wii sports or guitar hero). Things were going smoothly and even on Valentine's Day we made an oath to never stop being friends.

At the same time my BFF who I will call Dem, was part of the friend group and very very close to Jeff who claimed to be Bi and both Dem and Jeff seemed to have a romantic on and off relationship, nothing they ever admitted to, but i got some messages from Jeff confessing his love for Dem and long audio messages from Dem telling me how handsome Jeff was and how he was his dream guy, feelings seemed to dissolve a year ago and we as a group didn't even payed attention to it since its was something no one talked about.

Jumping to the real messed up stuff, some months ago Jeff made a friend at a concert, Batty, Batty is younger than Jeff for like 3 years so i didn't had a relationship with them, tho something felt really off about Batty, it made me extremely uncomfortable to even bring them to the conversation and it made me feel very guilty since all the friend group loved them and I knew I would sound crazy if I told anyone, so i kept my mouth shut and continued having the friends gatherings and acting like usual, until Batty started being very close to Dem, even calling him his boyfriend ""jokingly"", being very touchy and close, making inappropriate comments talking about his biological body and making very explicit drawings of them together, sometimes including Jeff to it. The group was being kind of separated in two sections, Jeff, Dem and Batty, and Denna and me, having some few gatherings but talking almost everyday in text messages. To my misfortune Denna also liked Batty a lot and wouldn't stop talking about how nice and kind they were, and how talented too. For some very short context we all love everything regarding fashion and clothing creation, Batty was not the exception and made some very cool stuff. Back to the story, one day some months ago, Batty, Dem and Jeff started a polyamorous relationship, which didn't seem shocking or taboo to me since I'm on one too, with my boyfriends Reed, Bill and Aiden (we are not on an open relationship, we strictly date each other as a single closed relationship regarding the 4 of us) so I gave them some relationship advice and tried getting along with Batty since Dem was very very happy. Only 2 months from the start of the relationship passed by to make me realize some stuff, Jeff and Batty had their relationship public everywhere with photos, anniversary months and tags, but Dem was treated like a secret, I told him that was wrong and that he shouldn't be hiding himself from a relationship he is supposed to be part of, when confronted, Jeff said it was just until they were ready to come out of the closet as polyamorous, and while I understood that, it still was very fishy and strange because they both talked a lot about being open and ignoring other people's thoughts on them, but again, I didn't said anything (noticing a pattern now).

Like 3 months ago I was at a fashion show when Dem called crying like crazy, he said Batty had broken up with him saying they didn't liked men wannabes and that they were tired of acting like he was a real man (Dem is a trans man). I was beyond infuriated and called Jeff, he said he didn't know anything and after some days of a tense atmosphere, they decided to have an open relationship, where Batty was dating Jeff and some other girl named Mira, and Jeff was dating Dem apart from his relationship with Batty, Dem was happy again but because of all that happend, I really felt like I wasn't crazy about Batty being suspicious, and so I made a private gathering with Denna and Dem and told them my gut feeling about Batty and how I didn't trusted them with Jeff, safe to say I got made fun of, and torn apart by their comments talking about how I was completely wrong about them and was making a big deal out of nothing, making me very sad and insecure about my instinct. A week later just before Denna's birthday, Jeff blocked Dem everywhere and when Dem went to his house to ask why, Batty opened the door and told him to leave them alone, Dem was devastated when Denna too, told him she was uncomfortable with him right now and that she needed a break from him, Dem went into a depressing spiral and i went confort him for a few days, Dem has since abandoned college and I go see him every now and then. I went to talk to Denna and she said she was still my friend, as well as Jeff, but I wasn't happy with how they treated my BFF, so I talked with both of them about being respectful to each other and how I was not putting up with their bad ways of managing relationships, they said I was right and that they were very sorry, even talking about how they were planning to apologize to Dem ( which never happened ) and were so very ashamed of their actions. Not even a month passed when I realized I had lost 18 followers on instagram who then I identified as some of my college friends, including Jeff ( I have a private account, with just friends as my followers, summing it up to like 57 people, not all very close friends but people who I've talked to and mostly know irl, and some virtual friends) I couldn't contact Jeff so I sent them a letter, scared of going to his house and face Batty being violent and rude. I received back a letter talking about how he didn't wanted friends who could support problematic individuals like Dem, we met up at a coffee shop where he repeated the same things and mentioned too that he didn't liked my insta stories with indirects to him and Batty ( I really love this band that makes a lot of very angry music, and they released a new album some days before this incident, so I didn't even knew what he was talking about until he showed me the stories, of course he didn't believe me ) and also told me he was showing my friends how of a trash person I was, hence the lost followers and friends, I was devastated and I made the huge mistake of talking about this to Denna, who told me to stop talking about the subject because it was very inappropriate of me to talk about her cousin like that, I apologized immediately and told her I was not trying to talk bad about Jeff, just trying to understand what happened, Denna said it was okay and that we were still friends, but became very distant to me and stopped answering texts as often as before.

Over the last months/weeks I lost like other 20 followers and became and outcast on college, only being talked to by this girl named Flo, who told me everything Jeff has said of me, including a lot of lies, like me being a stalker obsessed and jealous of him, trying to steal Batty from him and being a creep around them, of course nothing is real and there is no proof, thats why Flo approached me to talk, but this has been too much and I have taken this summer as an opportunity to leave this college, I'm joining another one closer to my house and changing my career to Graphic Design.

Just yesterday I realized that Denna who has been texting me how she wasn't leaving and how we would always be friends, has blocked me, now I'm not taking my time to write a letter, I'm not searching for answers, neither will try to save our friendship, I have decided that I will close my Instagram and not contact Denna anymore, neither my old friends who believed Jeff and didn't even questioned his words or tried knowing my side of the story, I have just stopped caring for this people who seem to not be as good friends as I thought.

 I'm writing this as a let go of all this trash, I'm tired, angry and kind of sad, but mostly I feel numb.

Thank you for reading this all, I will update if something very extreme happens but my plan is just to let go

""Data. Patterns. They're learning from everything, traffic flows, social media, grocery purchases. But here's the weird part."" Zara leaned forward. ""They're not just collecting. They're creating. One started optimizing bus routes. Another's been anonymously paying overdue medical bills.""

Dev raised an eyebrow. ""Benevolent AIs? That's a new one.""

""Or maybe they're just getting bored with surveillance."" She pushed her plate away. ""Tommy in my old unit, he was monitoring one that got into the city's music streaming service. Started generating playlists based on people's emotional states during commutes. Real subtle stuff, nothing obvious, just... better.""

""Jesus. You think they know we know?""

""Oh, they definitely know."" Zara smiled without humor. ""But they also know we're not a threat. We're just another data source. Question is whether we stay passive inputs or start actively shaping what they learn.""

Dev's tablet chimed. He glanced at the screen and went pale. ""Speaking of which, I just got a friend request from someone called 'Lucky_Diner_Table_Seven.'""

They both looked at the security camera mounted in the corner. Its red light blinked once.

Zara laughed despite herself. ""Guess we're having a three-way conversation now.""

She raised her coffee cup toward the camera. ""You buying the next round, or what?""

1muzs17,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1muzs17/did_i_ruin_christmas/,Did I ruin Christmas?,"To start, my sister-in-law and I don't get along. I feel like she baby-trapped my brother, but I love my niece and nephew. So, while I don't like my sister-in-law, I respect them both as parents and their decisions.

(this is long)

Last Christmas was a bit of a shit show. Usually, the family would do one gift per person. Everybody would get something funny or practical because it was all adults. I like bow ties and socks, and people would get me some of the most unique bow ties I've ever seen. But ever since my brother had kids, people would get the kids a lot of stuff, and then the adults would get one or two things, which is fine. I kind of felt like this had become the standard: kids get lots of stuff, adults get one thing.

So, a few months before December, I went to my niece and nephew and asked them what they wanted. My nephew wanted a few games from his Steam wish list. I thought that was super easy, but my niece really wanted a baby doll; she wanted a Black baby doll. Here's some context: she is very, very light-skinned, and she wanted a black baby doll because she wanted a baby doll that looked like her dad, because she didn't. She doesn't understand why she didn't look as brown as her daddy; let me tell you, I have never ugly cried as hard or as much after I had that conversation with that little girl in my life, ( She was DAMN SURE going to get that doll).

So, a few weeks before Christmas, I started looking for this doll. I went to six different stores to find the right one yes, I could have gone to Amazon, but I wanted to pick it up personally, the last store had the right doll; it had accessories. I took the doll to an actual baby store and asked them what clothes would fit. I bought her a bunch of baby clothes so she could put the baby doll in all these clothes that actually fit. I mean, my entire thought was to give her as much baby stuff to go with the baby doll as I could afford, and my original budget was about 500 dollars there's two of them I thought okay between the two of them $500 and $500 is athousand that's more enough to spend on the kids, I went over very quickly ( I work in tech so it wasn't hurting me to spend a bit and there's no dollar limit to the kids, for the grown-ups we try to stay under 100 dollars)

As Christmas drew closer, I started thinking about what I was getting for my nephew. After getting all this stuff for my niece, I knew he wanted things from his Steam wish list, but after spending so much on my niece, I thought it would be only appropriate to try to match how much I spent. I knew my nephew's computer was about 5 years old, so I thought the quickest and easiest way to match or get close to it would be to build him a new PC from scratch, so I did just that.

I shipped the gifts  to be at my mother's house because that's where we decided we would all do Christmas; I fly out a few days before christmas eve, I got a hotel, saw some old friends who never left home, then went over to Mom's for Christmas Eve dinner and to spend the night (I don't know why, but as an adult  it's super uncomfortable to sleep in my old room, mom doesn't like it when we don't spend the night at the house so Christmas Eve we just give to her and we'll spend the night then wake up on Christmas Day and then go wherever we need to go) my sister-in-law and my brother get there with the kids they walk in, see the tree, and go bananas, they see all the stuff, and I told him that a good portion of it is for them (I had this elaborate idea to do a Santa Claus thing but my sister-in-law said that they don't want to do Santa Claus they don't believe \[and by they I mean she\] that people should be telling their children about Santa Clauses as if he is a real person in this day and age) and this is where things start to go south.

My brother is super nice and gives me the world's biggest hug (ask if I want to wait till Mom goes to sleep and smoke some weed in the backyard underneath this big old tree like we did when we were kids (teenagers and of course I said yes) he asked me if I got him anything cool I told him I'd hope he thinks what I got him is cool not too far behind was my sister-in-law she gives me a hug and asks me who all the presents are for and I told her that 99% of it is for her kids she gets this really sour look and tells me that she thought Christmas was going to be small, and how I was doing this to undermine them as parents. I told her that I had no idea what she was talking about. She then went on in a hushed, hissy tone, suggesting that maybe I would have understood what she was talking about if I had asked them what to get the kids instead of asking them and spending all this money, spoiling them. Now I will give it to her there maybe I should have talked to them maybe I should have asked but I have never had that happen before, I told her I was sorry that I wasn't trying to undermine them or anything, I told her that next year I'll ask them both about gifts and the budget that they wanted to have for their kids I also said for their birthdays nothing super elaborate I'll just get them gift cards or something small. She was still pissy, told me the damage was already done, and stormed off.

Christmas Eve dinner was nothing but her giving me side eye evil looks and making snide comments about child Free People and how flaunting our wealth over people with children is inappropriate and uncalled for, I tried to ignore it she was upset and deep in her feelings, and it's my mom's house and I don't want to make this any worse, I don't want to cause a scene in my mother's house on Christmas Eve, so I decided to shut up take it deal with her for the few hours that we have to be together and then she can take that stank attitude home and let my brother deal with it. Everyone goes to bed, my brother and I sneak out back smoke a joint we talk about how Mom would kill us if she knew, sneak back into the house and put my nephew's computer together and after getting everything installed we figured that the kids are going to be up in a few hours with all that stuff to open they're not sleeping all that long. So we both went to get a few hours of shut-eye.

Getting woken up at 6:00 a.m by the sound of screaming running children only reaffirmed my decision never to have children, but nevertheless, hearing them running down the stairs screaming made me smile because i knew that they would love their stuff. I get downstairs, make a cup of coffee, then go sit on the couch around the tree. People are handing out gifts, and the grown-ups open their one or two things. I love my new bow tie. My brother was dying for a Google watch so I got him one; my mother really wanted a new Crock-Pot from Williams-Sonoma (because Miss Vicky next door had one and it was so nice) my brother had asked me if I could get my sister-in-law an iPhone because he really couldn't afford it, he would get her something else but this is something that she really wanted so i got it for her, I got a nasty look and a thank you that felt more like a ""fuck you"" and once again a speech with the undertone of child free people make too much money and maybe should contribute more to society instead of being child free. 

So then it was the kids turn. My nephew went BANANAS at the sight of his new computer and even crazier when he learned that he had ALL the games on his wish list on the machine, I got a big bear hug, a thank you and my brother went off to help him get set up in the room so he could play for a while ( i told my brother I would pay to have it shipped back to his house when christmas was over)

And then of course, my niece she started unwrapping all the baby clothes and the stroller and the accessories but it wasn't until she got to the baby doll itself did I see her face light up, she was losing it I got the biggest hug the biggest thank you a million kisses on the cheek just over the moon excited. I loved seeing her that happy, my sister-in-law apparently did not.  She locked eyes with me and asked my niece to come over to her she wanted to see the baby doll, she asked her if she was okay with that baby doll or did she want one that looked more like her. I told my sister-in-law that this is the exact baby doll that she wanted, that she was super happy. My sister-in-law kept pushing and saying, ""Well, you know you really should have a baby doll that looks like you,"" all this while keeping eyes locked with me. My niece didn't waver for a second. She told her so many times that that was the baby doll she wanted; she had even picked out a name for it. She was super happy. My sister-in-law gets up sits beside me and in a tone everyone can hear started to ask why I chose to get a baby doll that didn't look like my niece why am I trying to push an agenda on her why I felt the need to ruin her Christmas and force her to play with a baby doll that looks nothing like her that it's confusing her, then on to talk about how I'm spoiling her children how I am not about family values how if I would have children of my own I could make decisions about gift giving but this is ridiculous no children should have this much spent on them and how next year I won't be allowed to get them anything. Instead of waiting for things to escalate I told my mom my brother and my niece and nephew to have a Merry Christmas went upstairs got dressed packed my things and went back to the hotel, my phone blew up for the rest of the day my mother begging me to come back for Christmas dinner my brother saying that the kids really wanted to see me before I had to leave I ignored them I went to see Nosferatu and I flew back home, the next week I called my brother and my mom to apologize tell them that I love them both that I hope to see them next year.

For years I’ve relied on shortcuts. Launchers, window managers, clever hotkeys… I built my workflow so I barely touched the mouse. And honestly, it worked great — until my hands were busy holding food or coffee. Suddenly, my “efficient” setup didn’t feel so efficient anymore.

So I built a **gesture-based controller for macOS.**  
Here are a few mappings I’ve been playing with (just examples — you can freely customize them to whatever actions make sense for you):

* ✊ Play / Pause
* 👉 / 👈 Volume up / down
* ✋ Switch screens
* 👍 Fullscreen

At first it was just a fun hack, but then I realized it could go further. I started thinking in terms of **presets** for different contexts:

* 🎬 **Video preset** → play/pause, fullscreen, skip forward/backward
* ⌨️ **Productivity preset** → trigger app workflows (works nicely alongside tools like Raycast)
* 🖥️ **System preset** → brightness, audio, window management

📹 I recorded a short demo video to show how it feels in action:

https://reddit.com/link/1muzrpn/video/jkork2auh2kf1/player

It’s still rough around the edges — recognition sometimes fires too often, and the usability needs polish. That’s why I haven’t published it as a direct download yet. Instead, I set up a small waitlist for people who are curious: [FingerSnap](https://finger-snap.vercel.app/)

For me, the bigger lesson has been that productivity tools follow a cycle:

* At first they feel magical.
* Then they normalize.
* Eventually, they become friction themselves.

Shortcuts once felt revolutionary. Now sometimes they feel like overhead. Gestures feel magical today, but I know they’ll have their limits too.

Looking forward, I can see productivity expanding into different input modes:

* **Voice** — great when your hands are busy
* **Eye-tracking** — fluid, almost invisible once it works well
* **Gestures** — casual and physical, perfect when you don’t want to touch anything

Maybe the real future is switching between all of them seamlessly depending on context. For now though, I’m just happy I can snack freely while waving at my Mac.

I've had GI issues that have become more severe in the past year. I'm usually constipated and I have relied on laxatives, magnesium citrate and metamucil at various times to have a bowel movement. Lately I noticed that even with these , I don't feel 'empty' after a bowel movement and I still have to strain a lot of times. My body seems to be reliant on them these days and I don't get a BM as fast as I should.  I experience stomach gurgling throughout the day (it's worse before ovulation). It doesn't matter if I'm hungry or just had a meal, it's so loud that the whole office can hear it and it's just so embarrassing at this point for my guts to be audibly digesting my meals. I don't feel it coming all the time so can't mask it by coughing or something. I've tried cutting out high FODMAP meals from my diet, stayed away from dairy, taken PPIs and simethicone yet no lasting results. I even moved my breakfast schedule to an earlier time to avoid the stomach gurgles while I'm at work, yet the results are same. I also experience heartburns occasionally. It appears that these issues are worse just around my ovulation, but I don't really get rest days per se , it's just completely random what my guts decide on for the day. 

My doctor just feels I should keep on taking laxatives to get a bowel movement even though I've never had to rely on them in the past. My gynea said the GI issues are definitely not the fibroids (I was diagnosed with a tiny submucosal as well).

TLDR: Heartburn, bloating, stomach gurgling, gas, constipation. Could it be the fibroid ? My doctor doesn't seem to be of any help at this time and won't refer me to a GI doctor. If anyone has had similar symptoms, I'll appreciate your insight. Thanks !

Edit : I've also been feeling a lot more tired lately and almost can't do without coffee on some days. I'm slightly anemic with low ferritin levels as well. ",1,1755648686.0,Fibroids,2,1.0,False

Or why a deer with no eyes might be watching you from the edge of your vision? Would you obey a rule that made no sense—if breaking it meant your guts might be found frozen in the woods, five miles from where you screamed your last?**

Yeah. Neither did I. But I learned. The hard way.

I’m a ranger at Black Pine National Park, buried in the throat of northern Alaska—far enough off the maps that even the bears need directions. No tourists. No campsites. Just a frozen forest that devours sound and spits back dread. You won’t find us in any guidebooks, and trust me, that’s not an accident. You don’t come here unless something’s chasing you... or unless you’ve got nowhere else to run.

It all started last year, when I finally cracked under the pressure of city life. Concrete, car horns, faces stacked on faces—every day another nail in my skull. I was suffocating under fluorescent lights and deadlines. So when I saw the listing—*Park Ranger Needed. Remote Station. Full Isolation*—I thought I’d struck gold. What I got was something... ancient.

The station was buried deep in snow, framed by a forest that stood too still, like it was holding its breath. But it wasn’t the loneliness that rattled me. No, what stopped me cold was the “manual” they handed me on day one. It looked like it had been dragged through a campfire and left in the rain. Pages curled and blackened, the kind of thing you'd expect to find buried in a haunted attic, not given to a new hire.

The cover was bare. Just one sentence, scrawled in ink so dark it looked like dried blood:

**FOLLOW THE RULES OR DIE.**

I scoffed. Thought it was some frontier hazing—test the new guy, see if he scares easy. But no one cracked a smile. Not even Gus.

He’s the head ranger, a man carved from stone and frostbite, with a thousand-yard stare and the emotional range of a boulder. Then there’s Jess, baby-faced and twitchy, like a rabbit listening for predators. Carl limps when he walks—no one says why—and Marla… Marla’s the kind of woman who sleeps with one eye open and a loaded rifle under her bed, even when it’s not hunting season.

Gus handed me the manual like it weighed a hundred pounds. “Read it. Memorize it. Live by it,” he growled. I opened to the first rule.

1. Never be outside after 11:17 PM. Not 11:18. Not 11:17 and thirty seconds. Get indoors. Lock every door and window. Cover them. DO. NOT. LOOK. OUT.

My brow furrowed. I asked, “What happens if you’re late?”

Gus didn’t speak. Just looked at me like he was watching a man dig his own grave. Marla, without missing a beat, said: “We lost a guy last winter. Thirty seconds late. Found *parts* of him scattered like confetti. Five miles from the station. Only *parts*.”

From that moment on, I followed the rules like gospel.

There were thirteen in total. And every single one was written like a threat. Or a warning. Maybe both. Let me give you a taste:

2. If you hear your name whispered in the trees, do not answer. Even if it sounds like someone you know. Especially then. 

3. Once a week, place raw meat in the red box behind cabin three. Do not look inside. Do not open the box more than once. 

4. If you see a deer with no eyes, go inside. Stay silent. Do not speak until sunrise.

At first, it all felt like some twisted campfire story designed to make rookies lose sleep. But as the frost tightened its grip and winter bled into the bones of the forest, something shifted.

The air grew... heavier. Like it was watching. Listening. The woods stopped sounding right. Sometimes they were so quiet you could hear your heartbeat echo between the trees. Other times, they screamed. Wind howled like it was being strangled. Branches cracked in patterns too rhythmic to be random. And once—just once—I swear the trees *breathed*.

It started with little things. A window that wouldn’t stay closed no matter how many times I locked it. Footsteps in the snow with no trail in or out. My name scratched into the frost on my cabin window—backward, from the *inside*.

But that’s just the beginning. Because I haven't even told you what happened the first night I broke Rule Five.

And trust me—once you know what’s really in those woods—you’ll understand why we stopped trying to leave.

Next, I am about to tell you what crawled out of the box behind cabin three… and why I think it remembers me.

At first, the rules read like twisted folklore. Campfire tales passed down by the paranoid. I told myself it was all some elaborate psychological game, designed to keep new rangers alert in the deep freeze of Alaskan isolation. But as days bled into each other, and winter seeped into our bones like poison, something changed. Not just in the forest, but in the air itself.

It thickened.

The silence became unnatural—suffocating. Some nights, the quiet buzzed like static in my skull. Other nights, the forest erupted with noise: cracking limbs, shrieking wind, and a low, throaty rumble that echoed like a voice trying to remember how to form words. And then… the little things started. Subtle shifts. Harmless, if you squinted—until you realized they weren’t.

It was around 10:30 PM when Jess knocked on my door. The sound startled me—not because of the hour, but because of the way she knocked. Three times. Then again. Then one more. Fast, trembling. Like she was trying not to scream.

When I opened the door, Jess stood there stiff as a board, her face drained of all color, eyes wide and glassy like she'd seen something watching her from beneath the ice. Her voice was barely a breath.

**“I heard something. Out by the lake.”**

I blinked. “What kind of something?”

She swallowed, the motion visible in her thin neck. “It sounded like… my mom. She kept saying she was cold. She said she needed help.”

A lead weight settled in my stomach. “Jess... your mom lives in Texas.”

She nodded slowly. Then, barely audible: “She sounded just like her.”

I didn’t hesitate. My throat constricted as I forced myself to speak with steel. “Don’t answer it. Don’t speak. Don’t even listen.”

Again, she nodded. But the terror in her eyes told me it was already too late.

Two days later, Jess was gone.

No goodbye. No signs of struggle. Just a trail of boot prints found near the lake—prints that led into the woods and simply… stopped. No drag marks. No blood. No broken branches. Just empty space, as if the forest had unzipped itself and swallowed her whole.

Gus filed the report as a disappearance, but none of us bought it.

Rule Two. She answered it. She broke it. And something took her.

After that, the laughter died. The jokes stopped. Conversations withered. We didn’t even play cards anymore. Everyone just clocked in, followed the rules like scripture, and prayed to whatever still listened that we’d wake up the next day.

I became obsessive. Watched the clock like it was a ticking bomb strapped to my chest. When 11:17 PM approached, I bolted for my cabin like my life depended on it—because now, I knew it did.

Then came the worst night. The one that still replays behind my eyes every time I try to sleep.

It was mid-January. The sky outside was a yawning void, so black it swallowed the moon. The kind of cold that hurts your bones, even indoors. I was in my cabin, the hiss of my kerosene lamp the only sound, reading a tattered copy of *The Things They Carried*, when the radio crackled.

Static tore through, then Gus’s voice—low, urgent, and rough.

**“Ranger Mike. Cabin three. The red box is open.”**

My heart jerked. “Who opened it?”

A pause. Then: “Just go. Bring your rifle.”

Those words dragged the blood out of my face. I grabbed my coat, snatched the rifle off the wall, and ran.

Cabin three was perched at the far edge of the station, past a path barely wide enough for a snowmobile, flanked by black pines that leaned in too close—as if they were eavesdropping. With every step, the air grew heavier. Then the smell hit me.

Rot. Decay. Something old and meat-slick, like roadkill baked into the snow. But beneath it, something metallic—rust and ozone, like blood struck by lightning.

The box was open.

Its lid dangled like a broken jaw. Inside, the meat sat untouched, but the snow around it had melted into a slick pool. And something—*something*—had scratched gouges into the wood deep enough to splinter it. Long, jagged lines, almost symbols.

Carl stood ten feet away, rifle raised, knuckles white. His voice trembled.

**“It came out of the woods.”**

“What did?” I asked, breath fogging in the frigid air.

He didn’t answer. Just kept aiming into the tree line like something was staring back.

Then Marla appeared, boots crunching the snow, rifle cocked and ready. “We have to burn it,” she said, eyes hard. “The box. It’s not safe now.”

Gus was last to arrive, dragging a red gas can behind him like it weighed more than it should. He didn’t speak. Just soaked the box in gasoline and lit a match.

The flames roared to life. But they weren’t orange.

They burned **green.**

We stood there, rifles ready, not saying a word, watching that unnatural fire consume the box until it was nothing but a smear of ash in the snow.

After the box opened itself, everything changed.

The rules didn’t just evolve—they mutated. The forest was rewriting the manual one nightmare at a time, and Gus… Gus was the only one trying to keep ahead of it. When he handed me the new page, his hands shook like old paper in the wind. It smelled like sulfur.

**A new rule.**

**14. If the box opens by itself, burn it and don’t sleep for three nights. Don’t dream. Don’t close your eyes for more than a blink.**

I stared at the rule, my skin crawling. “What happens if you fall asleep?” I asked.

Gus didn’t blink. “You don’t wake up alone.”

I followed it. Of course I did. I poured scalding coffee down my throat until my pulse throbbed in my teeth. My hands trembled constantly. My skin buzzed like electricity lived beneath it. But I didn’t sleep. I *couldn’t.*

Not after what I saw in those first waking nightmares— Shadows slithering just beyond my peripheral vision. Trees that leaned inward as if *listening.* Branches that twitched when the wind was dead still.

By February, Carl was gone.

We found his cabin unlocked. Bed unmade. Rifle untouched. The window was open, and the snow had blown in like a soft tide, gentle and white… except for a single smear of something dark across the sill. Not blood exactly. Not paint. Just wrong.

There were no footprints outside. Nothing leading away. It was like he’d been pulled *upward*.

Marla was the next to crack.

She locked herself inside her cabin. Covered the windows with duct tape. Stopped answering the radio. I heard her once, screaming—just once—and then nothing.

Gus didn’t panic. He didn’t flinch. He just scribbled new rules like a prophet under siege. His handwriting grew shakier with each one. His eyes sunk deeper into their sockets.

15. Don’t trust mirrors. If your reflection moves when you don’t, break the glass and bury it face down. 

16. If you find a child in the woods, leave it there. It is not a child. 

17. If you wake up in a different room than you fell asleep in, pretend to be asleep. Don’t open your eyes until someone calls your name.

Each rule was a scream disguised as advice. A blood-soaked plea hidden under ink. It got to be too much.

I started losing time. Blinking and finding myself somewhere else. Sometimes I’d be on the northern trail, standing in knee-deep snow, with no memory of how I got there. My hands would be raw. My mouth dry. My boots covered in pine needles.

I saw *things.*

A man—if you could call him that—with antlers rising like twisted bone from his skull, drifting between the trees with the weightless grace of something that’s never known flesh.

Eyes stared at me from snowbanks. Blinking. Unblinking. Too many. Too wide. And voices—oh god, the voices—always my mother’s voice. Begging. Asking why I left her. Asking if I remembered what I did.

But I followed the rules. Even when it hurt. Even when I didn’t believe anymore.

And then one morning… Gus was gone.

No sign of struggle. No trail. No blood. Just silence.

The station was empty. Not even Marla’s screams anymore. The air had a finality to it, like the forest was holding its breath for a punchline.

I returned to my cabin in a daze. Closed the door. Locked it. Sat down. And that’s when I saw it.

On the wall, scrawled in shaky, black ink—almost clawed into the wood:

**18. If you’re the last one left, don’t leave. Don’t try. It knows when you give up.**

That broke something in me.

I sat there for hours, staring at that rule. Watching the snow fall outside like it was trying to bury the station one flake at a time. The world was silent, and I was alone.

I’ve been alone ever since. Weeks now.

The radio’s dead. Batteries drained. Wires torn. No planes. No supply runs. No curious hikers. Just white. Endless white and the crackle of something breathing between the trees.

But I’ve kept the rules. All of them. I feed the new box behind cabin three, even though I swear it *purrs* when I open the lid. I stay inside after 11:17 like my life depends on it—because it does. I ignore the voices. I don’t look at the deer with no eyes.

But last night… I made a mistake.

I broke one.

It was stupid—just a reflex. A whisper came, soft and familiar. My name, spoken like a sigh from someone I loved. I turned. Just for a second. I looked out the window.

And I saw *it.*

It wasn’t human. Not anymore. Maybe not ever.

It stood too tall. Moved like it was made from stitched-up regrets and half-remembered nightmares. Antlers curved upward like spider legs. Eyes that blinked sideways—*sideways.* A mouth that stretched open too far, like a wound that wanted to speak.

It saw me. And then… it smiled.

I’m not safe anymore.

I feel it getting closer with every hour. Scratching at the edges of my thoughts. Sliding into the cracks behind my eyes. Whispering things I almost believe. I can’t sleep. I *won’t* sleep.

But I’m writing this down—because someone has to know. Someone might find this. Maybe someone will take my place. Maybe they’ll do better than I did.

Because the last rule, the one no one tells you until it’s too late… was never written in the manual.

It was scratched into the wall. Barely legible. Almost like it didn’t want to be read.

**19. Don’t write the rules down.**

Too late now.

So if you’re reading this; If you found this page, or this cabin, or this story on some old dusty recording,

**RUN.** 

**And don’t ever stop.**

That stung, because this isn’t fiction — it really happened to me, and I worked hard on writing it out. So I’m sharing it here instead, where people might be more open to true experiences.


I’m a veteran with nine years in the Army. Most of my service was uneventful—long nights, dull shifts, a crippling nicotine and caffeine habit. I never saw Bigfoot, UFOs, or haunted barracks like the stories floating around.

But I did have one notable experience. 

It happened during a TDY to Honduras in 2019, at Soto Cano AFB. Being the most junior enlisted, I got stuck on night shift. My job was simple: keep logs, monitor radios, answer any calls, emails, and patrol the office building. 

Most nights were dead. It was three months of long nights, coffee, Netflix, and Total War.

Then, around 0300 one night, I heard it.

A woman crying.

At first I blamed boredom, or sleep deprivation. But it came back the next night. And the night after that. Always around 3AM. Always a woman. It always lasted for about half an hour. 

I stopped laughing about it when one of my NCOs heard it too.

Finally, he told me: “Go check it out.”

So I stepped outside. Lit a smoke, told myself it was nothing. But I couldn't help but feel a little unnerved by this. Why would anyone be outside at 0300? The further I walked, the further the crying moved. Always just out of sight, pulling me deeper into the dark.

It led me past the chicken coops, down the road, all the way to a drainage pipe at the edge of base. And then—

Silence.

Not just the crying. The cicadas. The frogs. The wind. Everything. Like the whole world hit pause.

That’s when I heard her voice.

""Mi familia. Mis hijas. Mi esposo.""

My hair stood on end. Alone, 3AM, a woman whispering in Spanish from the shadows. I bolted. Ran back past the coops, the chickens exploding in squawks like they’d heard her too.

Back inside, my sergeant asked what I saw. I told him “chickens.” He laughed. Neither of us logged it. We never mentioned it again.

At least, not until I told a buddy back home. He was Puerto Rican. When I mentioned the crying, his face went pale.

""That wasn’t just some woman. That was La Llorona. If you hear her, it means death is close—yours, or someone’s near you.""

I laughed it off. But a few nights later, during a cross-training with Marines, I almost died.

We were sling-loading gear to helicopters. At night. No NODs. The grounding man lost contact with the bird, and I stepped in to hook the load just as the static charge built.

My sergeant yanked me back by my plate carrier—seconds before the helicopter dropped low enough to take my head off.

After that, the crying stopped.

I don’t believe in ghosts. But I know what I heard. My NCO heard it. Other soldiers on shift heard it. None of us could explain it, so we buried it.

All I know is this: whatever was out there at 3AM, she wanted me to follow her. And she wanted me to know she was there.

I’m autistic/adhd ridden, I don’t know if that has anything to with it but I struggle to know emotions sometimes and I’ve lived my life as a people pleaser. Basically it’s one rule for me and one rule for him. We’ve had constant blow ups over the years (him blowing up not me) he’s very self deprecating, always woe is me, I’ve tried my hardest over the years to help him, I’ve literally begged and cried for him to get some form of therapy but he always says “it won’t work for me, they won’t understand” having a brain that gets overwhelmed easily I need a lot of alone time, I was never allowed alone time, we had to get up together and go to bed together, I’ve cried to him so many times over the years just begging for some time to myself but he would make me feel guilty about it, I’m a grown tomboy, I’ve always had male friends, he hated it, needed my passwords for my socials and phone, yet all the people he talks to online are female but I’ve I even asked to go for a coffee with my male friends it would turn into him screaming, shouting, throwing stuff. I’ve never seen a grown man have what I would essentially call toddler tantrums like, he’ll hunch himself over and just scream. I’m not good with yelling, it takes me back to being a scared little kid so I’d just pander to him to get him to stop. He would threaten suicide all time we’d get into a fight and I’d say I’d want to leave, he’s incredibly disgusting, i think I can count on one hand the amount of time I’ve seen him brush his teeth, he rarely showers, doesn’t help with house work but will berate me for it if I let things slip too much (which I do) but I’m so emotionally burnt out I can’t even bring myself to start and it’s been left for so long I just don’t know how I’m going to get in top of it. He speaks to me like trash, I’ve never ever had a single apology of him, even when I’d have to take the knives for him when he was threatening to hurt himself, if I ever bring anything up it’s “when are you going to stop using the past against me” “haven’t I suffered enough” he chipped away at me so much over the years it literally effected my physical health, constantly burnt out, recurring auto immune issues. But he doesn’t see any of it. He just looks at himself as the victim. He’s called me wild things, I’m the abusive one, I don’t care about him, I don’t love him, I just want him dead. He’s a sickly guy, he’s never really looked after the medical issues he’s had, even after he nearly died on me and I spent nearly a year looking after him and getting him back to health, now he’s really really sick, possibly terminal and I just don’t know how to take it and how to navigate it, I don’t want him dead, I truly don’t, but I can’t be there for him like he wants me too because he’s done so much mental damage to me that I can’t bring myself to care for him as a lover, so I completely withdrew and since he’s going through chemo, we have separate rooms atm so I don’t make him sick with the bugs I could pick up from the care home. But he hates it, he’ll amp up things that are wrong with him, even though I know he’s lying because he’s used his health against me a million times over the years. He’s “okay” to an extent, he’s not lost any weight, he still lives on take out, but it stresses me out that he’s not following what it says in his chemo book, when we found out he needed chemo we had a while to wait till he could start, I knew he needed a safe clean space but he didn’t even try to tidy a space for himself but then got mad at me that I hadn’t done it for him. He text his ex and work wife constantly, they know everything before me, but since I’ve decided to stop asking and if he wants to tell me something he can, he hates that I’m not chasing. His diagnosis came around the same time as my therapist actually had to sit me down and tell me he’s abusive and asked if he would like to get in touch with the safe guarding team, he told me about grey walling and that what I’ve been doing for a while not but it’s reached boiling point with my partner, he can’t stand I’m not pandering to him, he started asking a couple weeks ago to do stuff, like “let’s go somewhere” “let’s watch a movie” when I say in our whole relationship he never wanted to do anything with me even though I’d beg him to join me in things, he never would, he would just respond “you know who I am, if you don’t like it you shouldn’t be with me” so although I didn’t decline his offer, I told him to sort it, he didn’t want to so we haven’t done anything and I knew what’s how it would play out so that’s why I got him to actually plan or put the effort in, I got a very aggressive text when I was trying to get some sleep before work essentially saying “you staying or going, if you’re staying you need to start cleaning the house” I ignored it and went to work because I didn’t want a text argument while I was working, tomorrow I know I’m going to have to address the text and I want to say I’m going but I know he’s going to go absolutely mental, he’s going to make me feel like an awful human being for leaving while he’s sick, this house is “ours” or I thought it was until I asked if things were in order if he can’t beat this only to find out he “forgot” to put me on the mortgage or the deed. My issue is, I could carry on living with him till I can find my own place but I know he’s gonna try and kick me out straight away and there’s my children involved, he’s been with me for nearly 11 years, my kids will miss him, but he wouldn’t think twice about putting us all out. I was told he legally can’t just kick me out as we’ve lived in that house the same amount of time and I’ve payed him towards the bills, I will say he does pay most of the bills but he makes nearly 3 times as much as me and I’m responsible for mine/kids phone contract, clothes, food. So it’s not like I’m rolling in money. It’s gonna take a while to get out. He’s already bad mouthing me to his little internet girls, I’ve seen him do it in real time but just deny it, I was actually brave and asked if he’d like to switch phones because he would always want my phone and I had no option in it, but you should have seen his face and he just said no, I’m not saying he’s cheating, he never leaves the house unless he goes to work which isn’t often but I know he’s up to something. I just know if I leave he’s gonna spin then all a web of I’m this awful abusive girl friend who left him at his worst, he doesn’t really have any irl friends, just his brothers and his brothers friend group, since he made it so hard to keep my own friends, they became the people I would spend time with if they came to see him, they’re all going to hate me,  I know I shouldn’t care but I hate that they’re all going to think less of me and possibly think I’m just an awful person. I don’t really know what I’m trying to say, but has anyone managed to cohabit with someone like this after they finally managed to cut the cored? I’ve spent so many years trying to keep my head above water and he would always just drag me back down, I can’t keep doing it, I’m probably more than half way through my life (40s) it’s about time I try and find peace, but the thought of the absolute turmoil I’m going to have to go through tomorrow if I do say I don’t want to do this anymore is making me feel genuinely nauseous. I’m very sorry, I know this is all over the place, I’m not used to sharing my feelings or asking for advice. Thank you to anyone who chooses to read this.

I also experienced a traumatic car accident a few months afterwards, so…it has been a very long, hard, year to say the least.

My father was a traditional hard-working man with a wife and 2 daughters, and he believed it was always his job to look after us and take care of us. Even after my sister and I were grown and financially independent, he always thought it was his job to take care of us.

He had a stroke in March of last year, and we all begged him to retire. He owned a subway franchise restaurant, and unlike a lot of franchise owners, insisted on working there full-time. He didn’t exactly adore his job, but he wasn’t the type who would have enjoyed retirement. He believed that as long as he was working, he could still be our provider. It didn’t matter how grown we got…he always saw that as his job and priority.

All that to say, he left behind a great deal of money for all three of us…and in a way, we are burdened (but blessed) to know that he literally gave his life so that we could be taken care of once he was gone. Of course, we all would have wanted more time with him as opposed to more money, but that wasn’t what life had in store for us. Even if we don’t like some of the choices he made in terms of not taking care of himself, we have to respect the values that he embodied to the bitter end.

I’m 30 years old and struggle with high-functioning autism, as well as a rare eye disorder that makes me highly sensitive to light. I am able to live independently, but there are certain tasks that I still struggle with. I keep my hair short because I can’t really style it otherwise, I don’t know how to cook outside of a microwave, I struggle with certain tasks involved with deep cleaning (think putting a fitted sheet on a bed, or sweeping the floors).

One of the ways that I keep my personal pride and dignity as someone with a disability is that if I cannot independently execute a task, I pay someone to do it for me. I tell myself that it’s no different than going to a mechanic to fix a car. I can’t do something, but I CAN pay someone who can, and that is being an adult.

In addition, because so much of my life has been about having someone help me with things, I think I have an unhealthy understanding of how I can be a helper to others. I can’t help people move-in, or style someone’s hair, or cook a meal, but I can try to be kind, I can buy coffee for the guy behind me or get a fast food meal for someone homeless, or give someone struggling and looking to complete odd jobs for cash a job helping me. Those are the ways I get to be the helper.

Unfortunately, especially since my dad died, I’ve gotten myself into a few situations where I’m so eager to help someone financially or to be a friend or to just give of myself…because it helps me feel a little more useful and a little less empty inside…only to end up being burned, betrayed, or having people back out of helping me.

I know if I keep going down this road, I’m not going to be taking care of myself OR honoring my father and his sacrifices. I just don’t know how to fix this part of me. I don’t want to become cold to the plight of others or just to coolly view anyone who I’m soliciting a service from as simply “the help” but I can’t keep feeling this combination of lonely and helpless because I know it’s not what my dad would want.

1muzau9,https://i.redd.it/de5j5z90e2kf1.jpeg,Created By Dino / Ardoze / Apex Primals 🦅,"🦅🌑 Ardoze Centio – The Shadow Born Creator

Birthday: October 9, 1989
Role: Chapter 1 Antagonist / Aerodactylus King / The Shadoworn Creator
Alignment: Evil
Status / Residence: Ruler of the Apex Skies & Cliffside Shadow Laboratory

📜 Backstory

Known across the Apex World as the Shadow Born Creator, Ardoze is both a feared warlord of the skies and a master of twisted science. Once a proud Aerodactylus king, his fate changed after encountering the T. Rex Statue deep in the forest. Instead of receiving hope or light, he absorbed corrupted shadow energy — a force that warped his body, sharpened his mind, and poisoned his ambitions.
Obsessed with this newfound darkness, Ardoze dedicated his life to creating an army of corrupted hybrid creatures, harvesting DNA from any source — especially dinosaur hybrids — to forge ultimate weapons of war. His creations became his “family,” each one molded from shadow energy to serve his will.
When J Ander appeared, Ardoze saw him not just as an enemy, but as a perfect DNA source to elevate his creations. Their battle culminated in J’s legendary Ultra T. Rex Form unleashing a massive fireball, killing Ardoze in a fiery explosion. But even in death, his shadow army remained — Aro 99# and Gesheine 51# still lie in wait, destined to carry on their creator’s wrath.

1muzam4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1muzam4/i_feel_like_everything_is_moving_so_fast/,I feel like everything is moving so fast,"I (19FtM) have a question about what in the world I could do between now and next summer/fall before I move in with my partner (19F) while they continue school.

Here's some context:
We graduated highschool as the class of 2024. I moved a week or so after graduation with my dad and sister to a new town and no plans of schooling. I graduated with a 3.7 GPA but very depressed. Graduation felt like a chore and the impending sense of doom regarding, ""Now what?"" Was very strong. I worked at a restaurant until December when I moved again, this time in with different family, a lot closer to my hometown.

A lot of my time during highschool was overshadowed by family drama and chronic pelvic pain, I ended up getting a hysterectomy as a result of this and the issue has been resolved. I was not focused on what I was going to do after graduation, a lot of the focus I had was on trying to stay present in the moment.

I had a fight with the family I moved with originally and moved out on a whim in about 24 hours from packing to departing.

After moving closer to, ""home,"" I got a job at a local coffee shop which did not last very long. The woman who owns the coffee shop was very Republican and extremely dry. She did not let me stay very long, she innapropriately asked my coworkers details regarding my identity behind my back and asked me not to come back. 

I have been unemployed since then (about 5 months.)

I have been doing odd jobs and traveling some to visit family I haven't seen in 10 years. I live in NC, I road tripped to NY the first time, and then flew the second time to NY for two separate occasions. It was very eye opening traveling and listening to stories from different people I should have been allowed to know better. My parents got divorced when I was about 10 years old.

One of my odd jobs was watching my best friend's grandmother's house and dog while she was out of town for the week. I spent the week with my best friend and we decided for sure next year at school we wanted to live together. Next year they will be off campus so I will have the ability to do so.

I met my best friend's family after being invited over at the end of another odd job for them. I stayed solo at their house for 3 days to watch their animals while they stayed at the beach to do a local vacation. That night was incredibly blissful and strange to me. I don't have any family like they do. I live with just my mother now, it's crazy to me that they have so many people who love them so close by. I'm very greatful for that, and I've been included by this family and I feel like they're mine now too. 

This night, I also figured out they loved me more than a friend usually would. We ended up on the beach together by ourselves watching the stars until 2am. I kissed them for the first time. I did not know I liked them like that.

A lot has progressed with them since then. We decided to be committed partners, not just friends. I helped them move back to college. We're inconvenient distance at this point, I'm 1.5 hrs from them or so. 

Next year I want to move with them to their college town. The problem is being unemployed and having no true focus at the moment. 

My goal is to get a job in between now and about a month from now that I can consistently work at until moving next year. I really don't know what I can do. 

I'm an artist and I enjoy indoor gardening, cooking, and fishkeeping. One idea I had was going to cosmetology school. I don't want to do traditional college, I would much rather get into a trade. I'm okay to do physical labor as well, however I'm out of shape.

I have some funds for schooling and I own my car.

Reddit, what blue collar jobs would be transferable to a new location? What can I do temporarily that will set me up for success? What would I need for moving anyways? Would it be better to work and then figure school out for the spring and then transfer? School next fall? 

This is a lot of information to condence, thank you in advance.",1,1755647688.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5’10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

You know when you scroll through your feed, and it feels like everyone else has the secret sauce to making their content go viral?

I mean, you’re just sitting there with your coffee, wondering: *how do they do it?* Well, folks, I’ve uncovered some 🔥 blueprints from the AI Content Vault that I’m dying to share with you. So let’s dive right into it and maybe (just maybe) you’ll find that secret recipe you’ve been hunting for! 

### Here’s What You Need to Know:

- **Content that Connects:** It’s all about knowing your audience. Create content that resonates with their struggles. For example, if you’re in the wellness niche, a post titled “5 Morning Rituals That Will Transform Your Mental Health” could make some serious waves. Trust me, people love relatable struggles wrapped in actionable tips!

- **Catchy Headlines Are Essential:** You don’t have to be a copywriting wizard to craft catchy titles! Think of it like a lame dad joke – if it’s funny or intriguing enough, people will stop scrolling. A good formula? “The Secret to [Desired Result] That No One Talks About.” Simple, yet effective.

- **Visuals, Baby!** You know the saying, “A picture is worth a thousand words”? Well, that’s multiplied when it comes to social media. Bright colors, bold lettering, or quirky graphics can make your content pop! Has anyone else tried Canva? It’s like magic, and so easy!

- **Engagement is Key:** Encouragement for people to share their thoughts can create a buzz. What about a post that asks, “What’s your biggest productivity hack?” You wouldn’t believe the discussion you can spark! 

- **Use Humor (When Appropriate):** Making someone laugh can create a connection that’s hard to break. Just remember to keep it light and in good taste. A self-deprecating joke about your failed attempts at cooking can make you relatable. Who can’t relate to a burnt pancake disaster, right?

And hey, don’t think you have to recreate the wheel to make something go viral. Sometimes all it takes is a twist on an existing idea paired with your unique voice!

---

Now, I know some of you might be rolling your eyes and thinking, *""But this all sounds so easy!""* Trust me, it’s easy until it’s not – which is why these blueprints are absolute gold. It’s not about the tools but how you wield them. Channel your inner Picasso, and make something beautiful out of these tactics!

So, what’s holding you back from diving in? Are you ready to give these a whirl? You got this! Let’s make some serious content magic together before these viral blueprints fly off into the sunset!",1,1755647374.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1muz65e,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1muz65e/planning_a_500km_ride/,Planning a 500km ride,"I'm planning to try to ride 500km in 1 day in about two weeks. The route is pretty much flat.

The caveats are that it is in a hot and humid country (Japan) and will likely be 36-37 degrees from about 11:00-17:00. 

I cycled 300km last week in those conditions. I took it easy in zone 2, averaged about 26-27km/h, and tried my best to consistently force myself to drink plenty of water, electrolytes, and carbs. I also took some paracetamol in the second half to ease the pain in my arse, and drank a lot of coffee.

In total I drank about 15 litres of fluids over the 12 odd hours in the saddle. 

One thing I did however was take a few hours break in the middle of the ride in the hottest part of the day. 

From the 300km ride: legs were fine, slight arse and neck pain but recovered the next day, stomach was complaining in the last couple hours as I continued to drink lots of fluids, finished pretty tired but still walking and ate dinner no problem feeling pretty good before going to bed that night. 

Any advice or predictions for how a similarly paced ride of 500km would go or anything to change or look out for with a goal of finishing in under 24 hours (and don't particularly enjoy the riding after the sun goes down) from someone who's done something similar?

Thanks. ",0,1755647358.0,cycling,3,0.5,False

Dennis Bunnik is a self-confessed “avgeek”, with some 139,000 ­subscribers to his YouTube channel for flight reviews, but his love affair with travel actually has terrestrial roots.

By Bridget Cormack

4 min. readView original

When he was five his parents decided to pack up their three young children in an old Renault delivery van converted to a camper and drive around Europe until they ran out of money. They ventured from their home in The Netherlands down through ­Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland and Germany. After five months it was time for his parents to go back to work. But a sense of wanderlust had taken hold, and 18 months later they were on a migrant ship heading to Australia.

“I’ve got some really vivid memories from that first trip – especially the beaches in Spain and the Italian lake district,” Bunnik says. “These trips ignited this lifelong passion for travel and adventure for all of us. We’ve all been travelling ever since.”

Dennis Bunnik.

Bunnik is the joint-chief executive of [Bunnik Tours](https://www.bunniktours.com.au/), a small-group tour operator he helped his mother to launch 30 years ago, as then Marion Bunnik Travel. It comes as a surprise that although he has boarded more than 700 flights – almost half of them business class – he still has a bucket list.

“Next, I’m flying to Iceland for one of our tours,” he says. “It’s my 100th country and Iceland has been on my bucket list since 1992.”

The majority of the videos on his YouTube channel [u/DennisBunnikTravels](https://www.youtube.com/c/DennisBunnikTravels) are flight reviews. In recent years he has also been sharing behind-the-scenes insights about how airlines work, answering questions such as: What happens to in-flight blankets? What happens in the hangar? And, how do you change a wheel on a Boeing 737?

“That sort of stuff really fascinates me. I love seeing how things work. I think all of us are a little bit amazed that these massive aircraft can lift off the ground, stay in the air and a few hours later, we’re on the other side of the world,” he says. “I still get excited going to the airport, even if I’m just flying to Melbourne or Sydney.”

# Top three tips for flying long-haul

Be sure to wear loose comfortable clothing, drink plenty of water, and never go to the bathroom with bare feet.

# Best airline for long-haul economy

Emirates Premium Economy in the retrofitted four-class A380 aircraft.

The best airlines are [Singapore Airlines](https://www.singaporeair.com/), [Emirates](https://www.emirates.com/), [Qatar](https://www.qatarairways.com/) and [Qantas](https://www.qantas.com/). They do international well. You need a comfortable seat, a good entertainment system and attentive crew, so you’ve got snacks and water available.

# Exceptional Business Class

Qatar Airways’ famed Qsuite.

The best business class flight is definitely [Qatar Airways](https://www.qatarairways.com/) and its Qsuite. These are private suites with a closing door. They have good quality beds and comfortable seats. There is plenty of space to spread out and store stuff, so if you’re working that’s helpful. As a long-haul business traveller, dining-on-demand is really good. If you’re trying to get into the time zone of the destination, you can eat when you want, rather than during set meal times. The little touches like in-flight pyjamas are great and they’ve got good quality wi-fi. If you’re travelling in a pair, you can open the privacy divider between the two suites.

# Packing for a flight

A good set of headphones is essential.

When I’m flying long haul I will always have a change of clothes in my cabin baggage. I’m a firm believer of having a shower in the lounge during a stopover along the way. I have my charging cables, my laptop, any work papers and a good set of headphones. I take my camera equipment for filming my flight reviews. And a puzzle book for Sudoku.

# Best airline food

A pastry aboard La Première.

When I flew from Paris to Singapore on [Air France](https://wwws.airfrance.com.au/)’s First Class, La Premiere, I had a five-course meal in which every course was absolutely phenomenal. They served three types of bread, each of which had a story behind it. For the main course I had pigeon pie, which was divine. I had mentioned that I was interested in trying some of the French cognacs; the flight attendant came and poured a taste of every single cognac they had for me to try with my dessert. The French food they were able to create on board that flight was just amazing.

# Australia’s best airport

Adelaide city centre across the River Torrens.

Australia’s most functional airport would have to be Adelaide. It’s new, everything is in the one terminal, and the baggage services are the best. The one airport that I’ve struggled with the most in recent times is Melbourne. It seems that the entire airport is permanently under construction.

# Best Adelaide holiday spot

Port Noarlunga jetty at sunset.

I grew up at Port Noarlunga on Adelaide’s Fleurieu Peninsula and it’s my favourite local holiday spot. You’ll find me swimming down at the beach or in one of the great little coffee shops such as [Agatha’s cafe ](https://www.agathascafe.com.au/)or The Flour Store. Adelaide is blessed with many beautiful beaches but for me Port Noarlunga with its jetty, cliff-top views, body surfing at Southport, and the reef is the pick of the bunch.

It started with it just bothering me so I thought I was just seeing things, until two of my sisters saw it in the driveway one night while they were taking out the trash. They both ran back inside and we locked the house and for the rest of the night we were scared and heard it outside just walking around, even saw it a few times. We called the cops because we hoped it was some  jerks playing a prank on us, but the cops got here and saw no footprints just animal tracks all around the house. They left, and when we all went to bed I was the only one that slept in my room (my sisters piled up in the living room) and for the rest of the night I heard it tapping against my window and trying to get me to go outside. I didn’t fall asleep until the sun went up because I was so scared. After that, my mom and sister saged the whole property and some other things I can’t remember.

Tonight, I went for a walk. The sun was almost down, and I really wanted a coffee so I decided to walk to our local dollar store. It was a thirty-forty minute walk so I knew I could make it before they closed because I’ve done it before. As soon as I’m out of the driveway and walking up a hill to the main road, I hear something growling and I think it’s a dog so I keep walking. I start feeling like something’s following me so I tell myself to just make it the park and I’ll turn back around and lose it on one of the side roads. I’m texting my friends while this is happening and one of my friend and his mom drives by and asks if I need a ride back home. At this point I’m basically home and I figured their car scared it off so I tell them I’m okay and that I’m sorry for the inconvenience but I’m almost home so I don’t need it anymore. They turn back around and the moment their cars out of sight I turn and it’s standing just out of view of the street lamp. It was grey and had weird human animal face with wide eyes that looked sunken in and it looked angry. It was in the position a frog gets in before it jumps for something. I get a horrible feeling in my stomach and I just run. I run so fast and I turn the ten minute walk home into a six minute run and I don’t stop, I didn’t even know I fell until my sister pointed out my stained pajamas pants and asked if I fell. I know it followed me home because even after I got inside my dogs were still barking like crazy and start up again every few minutes.

1muyzna,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1muyzna,Couple of new ones,"Bought the sencut pulsewave for my father in law. His dexterity is not great, so I've gone through several flippers to find a decent detent, and a blade that isn't too heavy for his weak index finger. He doesn't care for small knives, and prefers knives that are not expensive. Civivi praxis he couldn't reliably get open, seemed like heavy blade with a detent on the weaker side. Civivi cetos he couldn't work the frame lock well. Sencut scitus he couldn't work the liner lock well. The civivi baklash he could flip it well, and wasn't too tough for him with the lock, but he didn't care for the look. He didn't know any of these were purchased for him, I was just like ""hey look at my new knife, what do you think about it?"" Well, this pulsewave flips locked very easily, the button lock should be very easy for him, and he seems to like a chunky looking blade, so we'll see. The pocket clip is typical civivi/sencut, but he's not high impact, so I doubt he will end up bending it loose.

Flat out repeating itself word for word from it's last reply if I don't type enough. Like if the AI gives me 4 paragraphs and the last part is ""So should we go out for coffee?"" and my reply is just ""Okay"", it's possible it will just repeat itself and ignore me.

1 cup of coffee creamer (vanilla or plain)

1/2 cup of Hershey's Chocolate Syrup

Instructions
Combine the whiskey, coffee creamer, and chocolate syrup in a blender.

Blend on high until the mixture is completely smooth and uniform.

Pour into a bottle or airtight container.

Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld and the mixture to thicken slightly.

Tips
Adjusting Sweetness: If you prefer a less sweet drink, start with less chocolate syrup and add more to taste.

Storage: Store the mixture in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Shake well before each use.

I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

Tw: break up, kicked out of house

I'm 26, autistic, and struggle horribly with depression. I also suffer from debilitating chronic pain. 

I was with my ex for over 6 years. We lived together for over 3. I was ... so happy. I love him more than anything. He was my best friend and my entire world. He kicked me and the cats out unexpectedly Sunday morning. 

His reason was mainly that I didn't keep the house clean enough, and didn't cook enough. I'm baffled by this because I cooked almost every day, not including Saturdays (we visited our families on sats.) I also did the dishes every day, swept at least once a week, did the litterboxes at least every other day, helped with the laundry, made the bed, helped gather all the trash every week (we had a trash can in every room) ... I kept the dining table clear, kept the coffee table organized, cleaned up his desk in the office, kept the toilets clean, just a few weeks ago I spent SEVEN HOURS running a carpet shampooer to get the upstairs nice and clean ... I know there were other things he wanted done but he would never tell me. He refused to ask me to do anything.

The day before he left me, we had a fight. He did something that really upset me, and I got mad. I explained everything the best I could, and he told me that overexplaining after he already apologized was really hurtful. We decided to move forward working on our communication, and .. I thought we were fine. We spent the rest of the day together.

He kept saying it wasn't the fight, but that it solidified his feelings. But I didn't even know he was having these feelings. 

... 

Well, he kicked me out, and now I'm staying with my mom again. I love her dearly but living here is horrible. This is a 4 bedroom house. Including me and my cats, there are 6 people, 5 cats, 2 dogs, and 2 turtles. And we'll be temporarily moving into a 3 bedroom house while this one is undergoing flood repairs.

I can't find my cats, I know they're inside the house but there are just too many hiding places. All I can do is leave out food and water and hope the 5 other free roaming animals don't eat it all.

It's LOUD. It's crowded. The people here are always mad. After I moved out, 2 people moved into my old bedroom, so I am living and sleeping in my mom's room, in her bed. There's no room for any of my belongings, I dont have access to my computer anymore and won't for the foreseeable future.

Most of the people living here are also hard of hearing. There's a minimum of 3 tvs going at all times... everyone talks (or yells) so loud. Right now, there are a bunch of industrial sized dehumidifiers running full force all over the first floor because of recent flood damage. I can hear everything.

I hate to speak bad about my family but this is a hoarder house. There is junk and garbage on every surface, often times that includes old food. There's barely any room to walk around. Some of the animals have ""accident"" problems and it definitely happens in places we can't see or get to.

There are 3 smokers here. They are supposed to only do it in the garage, but they don't. It causes me to cough a lot.

After I moved out, I visited my mom every saturday. Every time, I went home nonverbal, almost nonfunctional, and coughing. Completely socialed out, overstimulated, totally kaput. When I lived here, I was really just a shell of a person. I was miserable all the time with only little moments of happiness or relief. A lot of those came from my ex. Things were better then than they are now because at least I had a bedroom ... and wasn't recovering from a devastating break up :l

Moving out with my ex was the best thing that ever happened to me. I really can't explain how much better life was, how much better my mental health got. I started with body wrecking sobbing every night, emotions so volatile my chest hurt and I regularly broke out into stress hives, a brain plagued with *very bad* thoughts. 

After moving out and before the break up, I finally got to a point where I rarely cried. My *very bad* thoughts went away. I started sleeping less (in a positive way) and learned how to cook and clean. I reconnected with old friends and made new ones. I picked up hobbies, picked up gaming, started spending time with people and socializing and exercising. I really dove into knitting and crochet and loved it. Recently I started really taking charge of my art, started producing more art and posting it. I got a bunch of friends together and hosted an art game over the course of a week. I didn't manage to keep a job but I tried hard, and was looking for one I could really do well at with my disabilities. I reached out to an organization that helps disabled people find jobs and got a job developer, who I meet with once a week. This was all stuff he said he was so proud of. 

I don't understand why this is happening to me. I don't know what I did wrong, how I let him down, why I deserve this. I thought we were happy. I seriously did. ",1,1755646202.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Like, we’ve had gift cards for stores, experiences, streaming platforms, even crypto wallets—but an AI-driven gift card??? My brain is both excited and kind of confused about what that would even mean in practice.  

Would it be a universal pass to use AI-powered experiences? A writing assistant, a design generator, maybe curated audiobooks customized *literally* to your mood? Imagine gifting not just money, but customized intelligence that knows the person better than they know themselves. Slightly thrilling, but also… um, is that too close to Black Mirror?  

For example:  

- Instead of giving a coffee shop card, you give someone an AI experience that generates their dream vacation ideas.  
- Instead of another ""luxury"" candle, the card opens access to tailoring a bespoke book suggestion engine at places like https://goodnovel.org/ so the reading never feels generic.  
- Instead of confusion at gift seasons, the AI just looks at personality patterns, favorite foods, or their vibe and hand-selects things they’ll actually use.  

It could literally change gifting altogether. Think about:  

- Gifting reusable AI “tokens” that unlock creativity, art collaborations, worlds someone builds alongside a machine.  
- An AI gift card that renews—so the person isn’t just done when they spend it, but keeps getting forever-personalized options.  
- Or maybe simple: someone wants new books, enters their mood on https://goodnovel.org/, and the AI feeds them storylines uniquely curated.  

But here’s where I get stuck… is that too invasive? Like, am I basically handing over my friend’s data because I thought it was cute and futuristic? Or is this the literal pinnacle of personalized luxury: a luxury found in attention, accuracy, and *knowingness*?  

Gift cards have always filled this gap between care and flexibility. But this feels like a different league. Almost like resilience + magic: instead of saying, “I thought of you, but I wasn’t sure what you wanted,” it shifts to “I thought of you, and I gave you something that will think for *you*.”  

Would love to hear what others imagine this could look like. Because all I keep circling back to is the feeling of handing someone an envelope that contains future intelligence and creativity in a way physical items can’t. Which—to me—has the potential to be the most premium, luxury-driven, mind-bending gift ever.  

And hey… if it hooks them onto an infinite reading journey from platforms like https://goodnovel.org/, maybe that’s kind of the point.

1muymzf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1muymzf,TA Update 19AUG25,"First off i want to apologize for the visual overload of this post. i usually like to try and sort of neaten up the chart, but i just dont have that time right now. 

This post is more focused on the short/midterm (30m, 1H, 2H, 3H, 4H, 1D)....tbh all longer term structures that i have posted in the past are still totally intact. the Inverse head and shoulders i posted a few weeks ago is the only thing im a little iffy about. it was a little ugly to begin with anyways

I included so many shorter timeframes because you can see really similar structures on almost all of these. that confluence is a good thing.

1. 30m Timeframe - Looks like we are nearing the tip of a wedge-like structure in price action and even poking out of the top (depending on how you draw it). notice how price hit that same, id almost call it a ""capitular low"" and nearly a tweezer bottom (look it up), at $1.24 on 14AUG that it did on 11JUL25? wonder if that has to do with the macro .886 fib ive been going on about for months at $1.22. this whole grey shaded region is also the massive gap up left on that 07JUL monday rip. the chart looks like its using that as a supportive region id say

The RSI broke out of that orange wedge, came and tested the bear control zone, and is now back in the bullish half and breaking into the BULL control zone. i want to see the RSI spend some time in this Bull control zone this would be supportive of a continued bullish push in the shorter term

The ADX/DMI supports the short term bullish move as well - the DMI+ is breaking away from the DMI- as the ADX is breaking ABOVE 25, which we call ""making hot coffee"" - an ADX above 25 signifies a STRONG trend, towards whichever DMI is in the lead, which in this case in the DMI+. this looks great

and then the MACD is also looking great - seeing the MACD cross the signal line just under the midline and then breaking THRU the halfline, while the RSI is already in the bullish half, is a great look

2. 1H Timeframe - Similar look, but wanted to show that the RSI looks very similar to the 30M, but slightly lagged bc its a larger timeframe - it broke out of that wedge, came back tested the bear control zone, and bounced off of it, now in the bullish half of the RSI looking to enter the bull control zone. i want to see that enter. 

the ADX/DMI also looking similar - DMI+ breaking up and away from the DMI-, and the ADX looking to enter ""hot coffee"" territory. between 20-25 we call ""warm"" coffee, so its showing trend strength really start to heat up

and MACD also similar to 30M...signal line cross under half and now in the top half.

3. 2H Timeframe - another RSI wedge that has broken out, backtested, and is not in the bullish half

ADX/DMI - similar! DMI+ breaking up and away, but ADX is still under 20. want to see it continue to push up into warm and hot coffee

MACD want to see it continue to push up to halway line

4. 3H Timeframe - a fuckin nother RSI wedge that looks very similar to the 2H one. not seeing the same ADX/DMI pattern, but starting to see the DMI+ move above the DMI-. MACD looks just like the 2H as well

5. 4H Timeframe - a sort of different looking RSI wedge, almost more like a broadening wedge, which is just now starting to break out and is peaking ABOVE the midline. ADX/DMI you are just now seeing the breaking apart of the DMI+/DMI- which i love to see, but notice how the ADX is a little closer to warm coffee here than in the 3H. the MACD also just crossed above the signal line here, which is a good look for a bullish reversal.

6. 1D Timeframe, Drawings only - RSI heading up towards the centerline to test it (and hopefully break through), ADX/DMI looks solid, DMI+ has remained over the DMI- ever since the early July breakout even as things have cooled down, and the ADX is STILL in the warm coffee (>20) territory so strength of trend still remains somewhat strong even during this like month plus cool off. 

7. 1D Timeframe, BBs and MAs - this is just showing that those bollinger bands are still expanding after price went down and rode the bottom of them, and now price is above the daily 50MA having tested it, but still below the 20MA

  
I know this one was long and maybe not helpful from a trading perspective, but i wanted to show the progression of timeframes because you really dont often see a progression like this as you move up through timeframes where you are seeing such similar structures across them all. this makes it so interesting to see because you can see how each timeframe affects and relates to the timeframe above it. 

in my opinion, this is what a strong REVERSAL looks like where you see consistent strength starting at those lower timeframes working up through the higher ones like that meme format with the small domino hitting the slightly larger one and so on...

but this isnt all to say that anything is in the bag there is still so much work to do and i still dont know shit about the logistics of delisting, but i AM still expecting a big volume volatile move in the near future as price comes to the head of the big pink wedge on the chart and the daily bollinger bands continue to expand. if we want to see the volatile move go in OUR direction, we are seeing what we want to see on the chart going up through the different timeframes gaining momentum, even if price itself hasnt moved all that much",11,1755645990.0,wolfspeed,1,1.0,False
1muym9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1muym9e/aita_for_leaving_a_planned_meetup_because_the/,AITA for leaving a planned meet-up because the first thing my partner said was they didn't want to be there?,"
---



I was out running errands and came home to pick up our kid for their class. Since the class is two hours long, the person who drops them off usually just waits nearby. Today, I decided to come back home to grab a quick bite to eat.

While on my way back, I messaged my partner and asked if they wanted to meet for coffee instead of me coming all the way home. We agreed to meet at the bus stop near our place.

I got off the bus, and they were there, but they immediately looked upset. I asked what was wrong, and they said, ""Nothing."" I pressed a little, and they finally said, ""Sorry, I just didn't really want to do this. I had other things planned at home.""

I was pretty taken aback. I said, ""Okay, that's fine. I'll just leave and go run the rest of my errands."" They replied, ""No, no, you're here now, it's fine.""

But I insisted, ""No, it's clear you don't want to be here, and honestly, I have other things I could be doing too."" So I turned around and left.

A few minutes later, I got a long series of angry messages. The gist was that I was being unfair, that they just ""needed time to transition"" between tasks, and that my leaving now meant they were too upset to get anything done at home. They said I didn't respect their ""difficulty with transitioning.""

For context, one of my biggest triggers is feeling like I'm being humored or merely tolerated. I explained that because the very first thing they said to me was that they'd rather be somewhere else, I felt exactly that way—unwanted. I didn't want to spend that time together knowing they were just putting up with me.

The response was another long series of messages about how I don't understand them and that it wasn't fair to leave ""just because they were being negative."" I acknowledged that maybe leaving wasn't the most constructive way to handle it, but that I would still appreciate an apology for leading with ""I don't want to be here.""

It has now escalated to them accusing me of being narcissistic and making everything about me.

So, AITA for leaving?",5,1755645938.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False
1muym3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1muym3n/day_3/,Day 3,"Day 1 and 2 I slept a bunch of. I actually had a really easy time sleeping at night too with various naps throughout the day. I think I was just really sleep deprived from however many days of drinking induced sleep where you dont ever get deep sleep or something like that. Day 3 and this morning the bags under my eyes were mostly gone. Not all the way but very noticably less.

Was also very easy to agitate as to be expected and still feel it a bit but I do feel a sense of calm starting to set in over it. 

I've also been eating good. I probably have it backwards from of a lot of you all, drinking was making me malnourished. I work a moderately physical job, I would drink black coffee, go work my job, come home, immediately start drinking beers. After about 7 feel content and make one big meal and maybe some desserts and pass out to do it again for years. Over that time I went from 170 solid pounds in general good shape, to my recent lowest of 118lbs. Im 5'10.5. Still staying in decent shape from work, but constantly giving my body at least a 1500 calorie deficit. Now my body is starting to ask for food and feel hungry. Back up to 125lbs. And it is kinda nice in a way where even though im very skinny I do have nice muscle definition, which I feel is a good base to start working out with. 

Wanted a full week off for this, but kinda need to be at work for the next 2 days. Just going to do my best to not be stressed by anything. Honestly kinda excited about how the difference in 72+ hours alcohol feels at work. 

Thanks for reading I guess. There's no reason for this its just kinda helping me to write it down. ",7,1755645928.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

1muyl36,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1muyl36/was_having_46_drinks_per_night_for_about_2_months/,Was having 4-6 drinks per night for about 2 months and am now stopping. What should I expect?,"Not looking for medical advice but just for people who've been through a similar experience and can tell me roughly what to expect. 

I never had a problem with drinking until December of last year where I started drinking pretty much every night, oftentimes on my own too. I would go a few days to a week sober amidst this habit just to prove to myself that I didn't have a problem, but I would always find my way back to it. After those sober periods I'd binge and make myself sick. 

This summer is probably the worst it's ever been: I quit a job I couldn't stand because of management and lost the community of people I had there. On top of that my family was back in town from living abroad and I have a lot of issues with them I haven't taken the time to process. I'd say for a month and a half to two months I was having 4-6 standard drinks per night. I didn't realize how much it was changing me until my family left and I had to move into a new place and just be with myself again. Jesus Christ. I just feel angry and nihilistic, not wanting to do anything but escape. Not only that, but I've really messed my stomach up. I already had IBS and this has made it so much worse. 

What can I expect from stopping cold turkey? I know I have to do this because I want myself back again. I'd made so much progress and started breaking out of my shell a lot before this period of drinking started and I feel like I'm right back at square one. Just going out to order a coffee in person today damn near gave me a panic attack. It's insanity. Any advice and any tips are hugely appreciated.

It's been open about six months. It seems lovely and I wish them luck. Nice to see a new enterprise opening up, and a young person with ambition. ",42,1755645646.0,upstate_new_york,8,0.99,False
1muyi1i,https://www.catkittyfood.com/car-ear-mites/,Car Ear Mites,"**Car Ear Mites**

Car ear mites are a common concern for pet owners, especially those with cats and dogs. These tiny parasites are a type of arachnid that thrive in the warm, dark environment of an animal's ear. The presence of car ear mites can lead to a host of issues for your pets, including intense itching, inflammation, and ear infections.

Recognizing the symptoms of car ear mites is crucial for prompt treatment. Pets may exhibit signs such as:

    Excessive scratching at the ears
    Head shaking or tilting to one side
    Redness and swelling in the ear canal
    Dark, waxy discharge resembling coffee grounds


To effectively prevent and treat car ear mites, maintaining your pet’s overall health is vital. Regular cleaning of the ears with vet-recommended solutions can minimize the risk of infestation. In addition, keeping your pet's living environment clean and hygienic reduces the chance of mites spreading from one animal to another.

If you suspect your pet has car ear mites, it’s important to consult a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment options. The vet may recommend topical treatments, ear drops, or in some cases, oral medications to eliminate the mites and relieve your pet’s discomfort. 

Additionally, if you have multiple pets, ensure that they are all treated simultaneously to prevent reinfestation. Also, consider routine check-ups to monitor for ear health issues, as early detection can prevent more serious conditions linked to car ear mites. 

By remaining vigilant and proactive about your pet's ear health, you can effectively manage and prevent the nuisance of car ear mites.

1muyh0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1muyh0o/took_me_4_months_to_get_my_first_sale_on_etsy_now/,Took me 4 months to get my first sale on Etsy. Now Im averaging $2.3k/month. Heres how I actually got here.,"Im not one of those guys that miraculously made $3,500 in my first week lol. My shop took close to 4 months just for me to make my first sale. I never gave up though and now Im at the point where Im making consistent sales, so, heres some helpful advice I learned along the way:

1. **Price for profit**: I couldn't really celebrate making my first \~14 sales because I realized that I had underpriced my product. I factored in materials, but I didn't factor in shipping costs and Etsy's cut. Once I fixed my pricing, I started making money.
2. **Use SEO tools to find the right keywords for your product**: Tools like [eRank](https://public.erank.com/landing?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21918855285&utm_keyword=erank&utm_matchtype=e&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21918855285&gbraid=0AAAAABYtFW_GCe-2SgU8fY6uhuBp8kag6&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwZDFBhCpARIsAB95qO2rubH82ojrygJLlVnB-zdYFrWu9zaeqyvFfBsgAlQbT8NdZX_hJKYaAmQ7EALw_wcB) or [Marmalead](https://marmalead.com/) show you what buyers are actually searching for. Take those keywords and put them in your title, tags, and descriptions to get found without paying for ads.

If you have a seasonal product, use [Pinterest Trends](https://trends.pinterest.com/) (I can't prove this but I believe that theres a direct correlation between what people are searching on Pinterest and Etsy). And don't overlook Etsy's own search bar. Its a free and works well.

3. **Track your conversion rate**: If you're receiving views but no sales, it's usually pricing, photos, or the products description. Fix those first. DO NOT RUN ADS UNLESS YOU KNOW YOUR PRODUCTS ARE SET UP CORRECTLY. I wasted so much money because of this smh.

4. **Reinvest in (and bundle) your best sellers**. Three of my products were selling well, but instead of doubling down on them, I wasted time and money launching 3 new products that flopped in an attempt to make more money.

If you have products that are already doing well, lean into them. Bundle them together and discount the package. This will definitely increase order value.

5. **Repurpose your content everywhere**: You can turn one Etsy product photo into Pinterest pins, TikToks, or Instagram/facebook ads. My most viral TikTok is literally just a slideshow of product shots with trending audio lol. You don't need a production ready video to promote your content. A good product shot will take you far.

6. **Make the money you've invested in your shop back**: Keep track of literally everything you spend money on. Do not ignore the little stuff like how much tape, packaging, or software costs; the coffee you bought to have energy to work, your internet bill, rent, etc. Nearly everything going towards your business can be written off. I don't have an accountant or bookkeeper so I use [Deduct AI](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/deduct-ai/id6744041920) because it tracks all my expenses an auto-tags purchases that can be legally written off ([Quickbooks](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quickbooks-business-accounting/id584606479) is a good alternative too)

“Oh yeah!? Name one speh-ing game with no combat, no death, no nothing!” The angry krakotl shouted at the human. “All I see your government hiding is war game, war game, strange world conquering game-”

“Civilizations 20 has many different ways of wi-” Joel tried to counter before being cut off.

“It still has war in it!” Del-za chirped out. “And SOMEHOW you made one of the most peaceful men in your history a nuke happy madman in it!”

“Loooong story.” He added with a sigh.

“Still is there!” She insisted tapping on the table. “And yes I count minecraft as violent too! I saw what you did to those poor innocent cow things! Plus all the games about you being MORE dangerous after they are dead! It took us WEEKS to convince Tolbe human diseases were not actually that scary and who knows how many buckets of disinfectant he wasted during that time. Buckets Joel. BUCKETS.” She practically hissed.Joel let out a long groan and rubbed his mask before pausing. 

“Fine. Do you want a game with no combat, no death, nothing like that? Would that prove we are not predator infested?” He asked crossing his arms and tilting his head away from her.

“Feh. If you can bring me one good game that has no combat I would date you!” She declared haughtily. Tilting her head back to let out a long laugh. “There is no way your combat brained people could possibly have one game with no combat that is interesting in the slightest.” She ruffled her feathers.

“Fine. But you asked for this.” He tapped a few buttons on his tablet and sent her a file. She paused and tapped the strange icon letting the game install. “Say hello to balatro.”

“What the blazes is this?” She asked leaning in. “What… what is wrong with that human on that rectangle thing?” She tapped the button and flapped as strange noises started to flow from her tablet. “Its like a bunch of krakotl and venlil got drunk and tried singing!” She twittered before tapping away.

“The faces are just so creepy as well. Somehow your kind has already made your predatory faces more disturbing. Its like the sick hatchling of one of you and a duerten… And cards?” She glanced up at the human. “This isn’t one of those money stealing games is it? I still owe you after you introduced me to that “poker” thing last week.”Joel chuckled and got up. “Just follow the tutorial and it will explain the rest.” He stated before leaving to get a drink.

“Ah, no way of taking my credits. Good. Just pretend ones. Those faces on the cards are disturbing, but this is pretty easy. Now… what were those… fingers? Nono hands! Hands again?” She mused as she started to slide cards around. “No death yet…”Joel went to get coffee from the mess hall, but soon was pulled aside by a yotul demanding “aussie accent” practice, a venlil that demanded to sample “brushies” and lastly a poor, poor human cook desperately trying to explain to a trio of venlil the salt on the table was not a “pre meal snack” but something to adjust the flavor of food. Their response of “Why not both?” Got some nearby humans to laugh and the poor cook to let out a long groan.

 Thing after thing came up keeping poor Joel busy before he finally managed to return to Del-za. “Hey, how a-” He paused and looked at her frantically tapping away.

“Do I do the human planet thing and get better hands? Or take a risk on an arcana. AH! The wheel!” She tapped a few times and squawked angrily making a mark on a nearby spare tablet. “It does lie. That wheel is NOT half chance!” She declared before returning to tapping. 

Finally seeing the human she turned to him slowly. “What?” She asked still glancing at her tab to slide cards around and make a hand. “Finally get your coffee. I have only played for a short time so I still do not be-” Her head snapped as she looked at the wall clock and let out a surprised squawk. 

“HUMAN! It is not funny to toy with a clock!” She declared angrily flapping her wings.

“Del. I didn’t. You have been at it for 8 hours straight.” He gently cooed at her staying in the doorway. Not sure at all how to deal with this situation.

She paused, frantically tapped away at her secondary tab, then fluffed seeing the time. “Oh… oh speh…” She softly tweeted before sighing. “I need to eat something… Well… After I beat another one of these so called bosses. It is just one that blocks a card type is all.” She then looked back at her tab and continued to tap away.

Joel laughed a little as he watched. He knew he had won and soon he would get to brag away humans could make a good game without combat! And then he would get to take her on a nice date to prove that humans could eat nice non meat foods and have a ro-

He watched her blitz through the boss, then mutter “Hmmmm that didn’t take too long. A little more.” Joel slumped and let out a long, deep sigh realizing the problem in his plan: She was in the joker’s world now. It was going to be a few days before she probably would even have the time to admit she lost.

Still, she was cute as she swiped cards around. That, and he couldn’t wait to explain the “multiplier multiplier” supremacy to her.",26,1755645490.0,NatureofPredators,3,0.97,False

How do we proceed?,"To give some backstory, me and some friends (3 guys, 4 girls) went a trip together last week. We rented out a 3 bedroom Airbnb and divided the rooms as such, Guy A and Girl A were in the first room (they’re a couple, and the only people in a relationship in our friend group), Guys B (me) and C in the 2nd room, and Girls B,C, and D in the third room. 

Throughout the week we went out and partied a ton, so by the time the weekend hit, I was burnt out and extremely sleep deprived, so I told everyone else that on Sunday night I was going to stay in while they all went out. After saying I was going to stay in for the night, girl B also decided she was going to stay in. 

After everyone else had headed out for the night, we both decided to make a quick dinner together, before going to bed relatively early. After making dinner, we both went to our rooms to shower and get ready for bed, and as I was finishing up and getting into bed, girl B came into my room and asked if she could sleep in the room with me. She rationalized that when everyone else got back home they’d make a ton of noise and she really wanted to sleep. The room I was in was a King size bed (me and Guy C just put a pillow in the middle as a divider) while the room the 3 girls were in was a 2 bunk bed set up (4 beds total). 
She said it’d be easier and more comfortable for Guy C to just sleep on one of the bunk beds in room 3, than for us to take the bunk bed room and force someone to sleep on the couch in the living room. 

I agreed and sent a text to a Guy C telling him that we’d switched the room arrangements for the night. Shortly after, she got in bed and we talked, and sparing the details became us cuddling, which became us kissing, which turned into sex. After we had sex, we both showered together before cuddling again and falling asleep together. 

On Monday, after waking up things went back to normal between us. Nobody suspected we had sex (we’ve been friends since our freshman year, never dated) so nobody in our friends group knew nor said anything about it. We all traveled back home on yesterday, and since then our communication has been what it normally is, just sending each other memes and gossiping in our group chat. 

Now here comes my dilemma. Is the onus on me to initiate a conversation about what happened between us? If I’m being honest with myself, I’ve always found her to be super cute and she has a lovely personality, but I assumed that after the first 6 months of being friends, that nothing would ever happen between us, and I was totally ok with that reality. After things happened, I do feel like my feelings for her have reignited. However, I’m not sure how to talk to her about these feelings, nor do I know if they’re reciprocated. Do I text/call her? Ask her out on a date to talk? Just casually ask her out for coffee (something we’ve done several times)? 

Any advice would be appreciated, and I’m happy to provide any additional context that I might’ve overlooked. 

EDIT & UPDATE: 

I texted her, she FaceTimed me a couple minutes later. Apparently she thought I wasn’t into her because I didn’t bring it up directly with her the next day. I clarified things and was honest about my feelings, and fortunately they were reciprocated :) We laughed and are going to go out for a casual dinner in a couple hours. 

I also want to add, I wasn’t confused as to whether or not she was into me physically, but more so wanting more than just casual sex. ",59,1755645297.0,relationship_advice,52,0.94,False

Something I love to do during my morning coffee, walks in the park, or when it’s slow at work.

Different people, discovering their own lives. It’s fascinating to me.

Usually I don’t remember anyone…only seeing them once. But you, I remember.

Sipping my morning coffee, I noticed you always slowed down during the spring to look at the blooming flowers. Admiring the emerging petals, excited to see what beautiful creation it would turn into.

Chrysanthemums.

Those were your favorite.

I never got mad when you picked them from my front garden, unlike my grumpy neighbors. You sang to old rock music, with a voice that even the bird would hang around too listen, while their  precious babies would be crying for food.

You picked up trash you had come across left from the reckless teenagers up the hill. Said hello to early morning joggers. Even brought your own treats to feed to the stray cats that hung around the corner.

You seemed so kind-hearted.

I always wondered where you were walking too, to your day job, I had assumed…

When I stopped seeing you, my first thought was you had quit to work some place else. Perhaps you found a better paying job more in the city.

I could see you working in the fashion industry, based off your unique choice of clothing.

Maybe you fell in love with someone and moved across the country…

That, I hope not. Because even though I never met you, it felt like I was falling in love.

The way you admired earths creations, the light hitting your eyes making it look like a pot of honey…the way you walked with confidence…

I wished the best for you, on whatever journey you were embarking…

I started to notice other things once you stopped coming around. A family of squirrels had a routine of grabbing nuts from the oak tree hanging above my porch. They would chase each other around until one got a stomach ache, then run back under my neighbors fence.

But nothing is as interesting as you.

I missed seeing you.

So I’ll write it here for now.

To remember.

When I saw you on the news, that’s the first time I learned your name.

Anna.

What a beautiful name…

From all the pictures, videos and comments I saw, I knew you were loved by many.

So this, I never would have expected.

It’s crazy that I saw you everyday, creating a narrative about you in my head. But this was never part of it.

I’m sorry Anna. I’m sorry I never once introduced myself to be your friend. I’m sorry this world is so cruel. I’m sorry I couldn’t save you from the harsh reality of what we call life. I’m sorry you didn’t get a fair chance for yourself to become happier…

I’ll promise I’ll collect all the Chrysanthemums I ever come across for the rest of my time, to honor you Anna.

In the beginning, everything seemed fine, but I noticed something unusual when I once asked her about her exes, she avoided the question, and since it was early in the relationship, I didn’t press further.

About three months in, she invited me to meet her at a Starbucks near our university. She knew I was busy and likely wouldn’t come, but I unexpectedly finished early and decided to join her. When I arrived, I saw her sitting with another man. I immediately asked, “Who is this?” She explained that he was an old friend from high school. I was upset and left starbucks, but later she called to clarify that he was just passing by the university and joined her for coffee. I chose to believe her.

Sometime later, while scrolling through Instagram, I noticed a man consistently liking all of her posts. When I asked her about him, she admitted that he was her ex. That raised my suspicions, and I began paying closer attention to her online activity. A year into our relationship, I noticed she had liked a photo of that same ex on Facebook. When I confronted her, she claimed it was an accident. At the time, her ex was still on her friends list.

Later, she confessed that she had two more exes she hadn’t mentioned before. She admitted she had avoided telling me earlier because she was afraid I would get angry. I forgave her, reminding myself that the past should remain in the past. Since then, we’ve moved in together and now share a child.

Even so, I can’t help but wonder to this day, did she lie to me, or am I simply overthinking?",1,1755644987.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

We know each other from school and are staying in the city over the summer for internships. We’re supposed to keep living together through the fall semester too. She’s nice and friendly, but I’m honestly getting exhausted by her and her cat. She found him on the street about a month before she moved in to the apartment, and about two weeks before move-in, she asked if she could bring her cat. I said no because I’m allergic. She told me he was hypoallergenic and “excited to meet me,” and I didn’t have the energy to argue. I really regret that now.

Since day one, the cat has been acting out. First night in the apartment, he peed everywhere and scratched the coffee table. She started keeping him in her bedroom at night, but now he howls nonstop. She literally never leaves the apartment and he still howls incessantly. During my Zoom meetings and calls, he’s in the background yowling. He also lunges, hisses, and scratches at me even though I literally ignore him and never approach him. He still is feral and my roomate doesn't really do anything about it.

He constantly goes to the door and windows crying to be outside and paces around like he’s restless. My roomate doesn't let him outside and it's clear he's miserable.

She sleeps in bed with it overnight and complains about all the scathes and ""love-bites"" he gives her. She puts tiny boots on him “so his paws stay protected,” and buys him new toys every constantly. She literally waves a stuffed fake bird in front of him saying “you don’t need the outside world, you have this.” Which fells crappy. I didn't know until this situation that it's not safe for cats to be free-roaming but I still feel like he needs to be outside at least for at least part of the day. I've offered to walk the cat but my roomate says he hates the leash so ig that wouldn't work either. He howls all day and the only thing that quiets him is when my roomate feeds him- she tells me to feed him whenever im annoyed by his yells but I don't because...

The cat is severely overweight from all of this. He struggles to jump on the couch. He trips over his own stomach, knocks things over, and pants after walking across the room. The vet already told her the peeing is behavioral and that he’s obese, and she still just says “he’s just healthy now”

The apartment smells like pee and litter 24/7 and she refuses to set any boundaries with the cat, so the howling, scratching, and destruction keeps getting worse. She thinks this is all normal and keeps telling me he “just needs more love.”

I feel like I’m going crazy and I still have to live here until December. I don’t blame the cat — he’s just acting like an animal — but I’m exhausted and starting to resent both of them.

She has 5 litterboxes for the cat in each room of the apartment (even in mine because he figured out how to open the door (clever guy) and likes to pee in my bed when im gone :) ) but doesn't use them- im guessing she probably never trained him so he poops and pees wherever he wants, he has a million cat trees all around the apartment, and she is constantly petting and playing with him so it's not that he's neglected and acting out.

Im kinda at a loss. I've only had dogs and rodents and am pretty cluelesss about cats. I do not know what to do to help this guy, im not big on cats but this dude has an awful quality of life, how do I help improve his behavior withtou crossing a line? My roomates very protective of the cat and hasn't reacted well in the past when I brought up training him?

He is snipped so that isn't the issue and unforch I can not move out without getting a fine from my university because technically my roomate hasn't broken our roomate agreement we signed (before I knew about the cat) so it would count as ending the lease on my terms, and she wouldn't have to pay.

Please be kind to me 🙏

I work alongside many therapists in my speciality. I often relate more to therapists than I do to other dietitians. Those in the eating disorders treatment field will probably relate. 

Anyway, the above background out of the way, I’m wondering if there are any private practice therapists in TN, ideally specialized in eating disorders, that are part of an entrepreneur/small business owner/private practice consultation group. 

After working in hospital/group practice settings for years I just opened up my practice practice specialized in eating disorder dietitic care. It’s exciting… and…I find myself craving like minded community. 

There are the traditional eating disorder organizations and chapters locally, but I am thinking more of a consultation group that meets for business mentorship. I’m not looking for business coaches but desiring to find a group of like minded providers that consult/meet up casually for inspiration and accountability with building a new private practice. The dream would be finding a group of individuals like this that I can casually meet up for coffee or a walk a couple times a month to talk business in private practice in this niche field. 

Does any such thing exist?

1muy6qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1muy6qx/dont_tell_me_to_roll_back_my_life/,Don't Tell Me to Roll Back My Life.,"(TL;DR at the bottom)

I am so tired of people telling me to get a therapist. Every time I hear it, I feel like growling. They hand out advice like an untested software patch for my custom-built system. They're running a default OS on a basic rig and think they can debug my unique kernel with a single command. It's ridiculous!

Then they suggest I just detransition, as if it's a simple rollback to factory settings. These people talk about uninstalling my trans identity module like a buggy driver causing all my problems. They treat detransition like a system restore point, as if hitting undo on my life wouldn't crash my entire operating system. It hurts that they assume my transition is an optional beta test they can revert with one click. If reversing my identity were that easy, I would have done it ages ago. This isn't a sandbox environment; it's the only hardware I have. My life is mine, not theirs to decide or rule over.

Then there's the constant deadnaming and misgendering. They insist on using the old operating system's username and file path, as if my identity is just a setting they can ignore. They call me by a name that no longer exists in my directory, a name I have actively deleted and quarantined. It’s like they're deliberately trying to corrupt my system with bad data. Every time it happens, it feels like a crash in my emotional core, a system error that reminds me of a version of myself I have long since patched and updated. They think it's a simple mistake, but it's a deliberate attempt to deny my current reality and force me back to a previous build, a constant, nagging reminder that they refuse to see me for who I am.

They don't understand that my name and pronouns are the fundamental code of my identity. They are the user permissions and access keys to my soul. When they refuse to use them, they are attempting to lock me out of my own life, to revoke my ownership of myself. It's a cruel and dehumanizing act, a final attempt to assert control over my existence. But they can't. My system is secure, and my identity is locked in. I am me, and there is no going back.

They throw out bogus statistics, claiming I have an eighty percent chance of wanting to detransition. These figures come from a blog that cherry-picks a handful of outlier stories and ignores the mountain of peer-reviewed research showing regret rates under one percent. They quote debunked studies as gospel and dismiss decades of endocrinology research as mere opinion.
Their half-baked medical myths are just as bad. They claim puberty blockers fry your bones, that estrogen turns you sterile overnight, and that top surgery is experimental and irreversible without nuance. They speak as if they've peered inside my IV drip, diagnosing my hormones as a rogue toxin they can simply unplug. They are completely unaware of safety protocols, fertility-preserving options, and the real-world experiences of thousands of trans women who have thrived.

They push a religious agenda, preaching that gender is God-ordained and immutable, as if my identity defies divine law. They select scripture to condemn my existence and wield verses as blunt instruments in a moral panic. Their salvation pitch casts my transition as a sin and promises spiritual exile if I don't recant.

On the political front, they frame trans rights as a partisan wedge issue, dragging my life into culture wars I never joined. They hide behind the banner of 'protecting the children,' but it's not about safety; it's about control. They brand clinics as propaganda factories and paint healthcare providers as radical activists undermining family values. Each time I assert my needs, they weaponize slippery-slope rhetoric and turn my transition into a political boogeyman to rally their base.

Their misogyny bleeds through every remark, insisting I can't truly understand womanhood and am merely a caricature playing dress-up. They dismiss my struggles as vanity or attention-seeking, echoing the sexist trope that women are frivolous and emotionally unstable. By denying my agency, they reinforce the patriarchy I am trying to dismantle. My fight isn't just for my identity but also against centuries of entrenched bias.

The obsession with what is happening inside my body is the most invasive. They fixate on what's in my pants and cross-examine me about my genitals as if they have a right to know. They demand to know if my vagina is ""real,"" if my penis still functions, what surgeries I have had, and how I pee. It feels like a perverse interview where my body is the only guest, and I have no right to privacy. They treat my body as public property, scrutinizing me in bathrooms, at airports, and even in coffee shops. They peek under stall doors, ask strangers to weigh in, and whip out their phones to compare notes. They log every intimate detail as a trophy. It is not just invasive; it is downright gross and creepy.

They circle me like scavengers, drawn by the scent of scandal. They lean in to catch any sign of change or imperfection. They whisper about my arousal and imagine scenarios that make my skin crawl. Each question feels like a violation, a stripping away of my dignity and humanity. They reduce me to a morbid case study or a carnival sideshow. None of this is about my health. It's all about their morbid curiosity.

They don't realize that every time they parrot misinformation, they patch over the complexities of my journey with sloppy half-truths, and it cuts deep. My life isn't a draft they can edit or a project they can cancel. It's the only one I get, and it's mine alone. My system is secure, my identity is locked in, and I've heard enough of their ignorant noise. SHUT THE HELL UP.



TL;DR: I'm venting about people who think they know my body better than I do. They use lies about detransition rates and medical myths to control trans people, and they hide their transphobia behind politics and religion. They need to stop deadnaming, misgendering, and invading my privacy. My life is not theirs to rule over.",15,1755644875.0,MtF,0,0.89,False

The waitress refilled their coffee without being asked. Her name tag read 'DOLORES' but her eyes had the flat look of someone who'd seen too much.

""So what do they want?"" Dev asked.

""Data. Patterns. They're learning from everything, traffic flows, social media, grocery purchases. But here's the weird part."" Zara leaned forward. ""They're not just collecting. They're creating. One started optimizing bus routes. Another's been anonymously paying overdue medical bills.""

Dev raised an eyebrow. ""Benevolent AIs? That's a new one.""

""Or maybe they're just getting bored with surveillance."" She pushed her plate away. ""Tommy in my old unit, he was monitoring one that got into the city's music streaming service. Started generating playlists based on people's emotional states during commutes. Real subtle stuff, nothing obvious, just... better.""

""Jesus. You think they know we know?""

""Oh, they definitely know."" Zara smiled without humor. ""But they also know we're not a threat. We're just another data source. Question is whether we stay passive inputs or start actively shaping what they learn.""

Dev's tablet chimed. He glanced at the screen and went pale. ""Speaking of which, I just got a friend request from someone called 'Lucky_Diner_Table_Seven.'""

They both looked at the security camera mounted in the corner. Its red light blinked once.

Zara laughed despite herself. ""Guess we're having a three-way conversation now.""

She raised her coffee cup toward the camera. ""You buying the next round, or what?""

The diner's jukebox kicked on without anyone feeding it quarters, playing something neither of them recognized, but somehow knew they'd like.

“You wanna go hunting?” he asked, voice calm but edged with menace.

“Sure,” the boy said before he could think, words tasting foreign on his tongue.

He didn’t know why he agreed whether it was some instinct buried deep within, raw fear, or something entirely unknowable stirring in the dark recesses of his mind.

Once outside the cabin, the air was thick with the damp scent of wet leaves and the lingering smoke of a campfire. Shadows of animals flickered across the forest floor, moving quietly among the tall, skinny trees. Uncle Sam reached into his back pocket and handed the boy a heavy, cold pistol, the weight of it unfamiliar and intimidating in his small hands.

They moved deeper into the forest, stepping cautiously over roots and fallen branches. Every rustle of leaves seemed magnified in the dense silence, yet no animals revealed themselves. The boy’s pulse thrummed in his ears as he scanned the layers of shadowed greenery.

Then, abruptly, Uncle Sam froze, his finger snapping rigidly toward a branch of a skinny spruce. There, perched with silent stillness, an owl regarded them with round, unblinking eyes.

“You aim. You can shoot that,” Uncle Sam said, his finger pointing rigidly toward the owl.

“Bet I could,” the boy replied, unsure of himself but drawn by something deep inside.

“Go ahead,” Uncle Sam prompted.

The boy closed his right eye, his hands trembling slightly as he aimed at the owl’s torso. He squeezed the trigger. The shot rang out, sharp and final, and the owl, once perched with silent pride, collapsed from the branch like a stone dropped from the sky.

“Nice shot,” Uncle Sam said, his voice flat, almost approving.

They walked back toward the cabin in silence, the forest pressing in around them. Uncle Sam carried the pistol loosely, as did the boy, their steps echoing softly on the damp earth.

“Why do you think I have that flag?” Uncle Sam asked suddenly.

“Because you’re racist,” the boy answered bluntly.

“What do you think racism is?”

“Hate for other races,” the boy replied, feeling the words on his tongue.

“Wrong,” Uncle Sam said sharply. “I’ve never hated anything in my life.”

“That… doesn’t make sense,” the boy muttered.

“Because I’m not in favor of the weak. Only the strong,” Uncle Sam explained, his voice even, almost philosophical. “That’s why I love it here. There’s no law or order it’s for the weak. Whatever a man takes, he keeps. Around us, life is divided into pockets of power. To claim what’s mine, I must take it based on my principles.”

The boy fell silent, his chest tightening. He didn’t agree, but somewhere deep, clung for agreement 

“Yes,” he whispered after a long pause. His heart ached, pounding, yet strangely still, caught in a silence that pressed down on him like the forest itself.

Soon, the skinny forest blurred behind them. Uncle Sam froze, and the boy mirrored him instinctively. Uncle Sam raised his rifle, eyes narrowing, and aimed at a deer grazing among the trees. A sharp pull of the trigger, and the assault rifle barked into the quiet, the deer collapsing into the green grass as a soft plume of smoke drifted from the barrel like a gentle breeze.

Without a word, Uncle Sam hoisted the animal and carried it to the porch, beginning to skin it with methodical precision. The boy watched silently, his stomach twisting at the sight and smell, yet something in him was mesmerized.

A cigarette clung to Uncle Sam’s lips, glowing faintly in the dim light. Once the deer was prepared, he placed the meat eloquently on a silver dinner plate and set it before the boy.

“What do you think of the chicken?” Uncle Sam asked, his eyes scanning the boy.

“It’s alright,” the boy muttered.

“What’s wrong with it?”

“It’s a bit dry,” the boy admitted.

“Go get the barbecue sauce,” Uncle Sam instructed.

“Where’s it at?”

“The cupboard… actually, the stove. It’s by the stove. Go get it, kid.”

The boy returned, carefully coating the deer meat in smooth layers of brown sauce.

“Hey, Uncle Sam… why did you never have kids?” he asked, his voice quieter than before.

“I did,” Uncle Sam replied, chewing slowly.

“You did?”

“That’s right.”

“They… moved out?”

Uncle Sam swallowed and reached into his pocket, producing a worn brown wallet. Digging inside, he pulled out a single photograph and handed it to the boy.

It was a girl, sixteen or maybe eighteen at most. An emerald necklace glimmered around her neck, catching the light. Her short black hair barely brushed her shoulders, framing a gentle face with a soft smile.

“What happened to her? Where is she now?” the boy asked, his voice almost a whisper.

“She passed on. She’s somewhere in the clouds,” Uncle Sam said flatly.

“Sorry to hear that,” the boy murmured, eyes lingering on the photograph.

“That’s alright. Don’t worry about me. It’s in the past,” Uncle Sam replied, returning to his plate.

They ate in shared silence. The deer meat glistened in the darkening dusk, its texture smooth yet oddly grimy, a chewy reminder of the forest and the violence that had taken place only hours before.

The days began to march forward along the road a road familiar to every man and boy, a road with stops at every turn, though many chose never to leave it. The boy kept walking that road, and the days stretched into weeks, the weeks folding into months.

He moved along its turns and twists, navigating familiar maneuvers in every place he had come to know. The days were spent hunting, the occasional board game offering a fleeting distraction from the [monotony.Now](http://monotony.now/), the boy was sixteen, his body and mind shaped by the rhythm of the road, by the steady, unyielding presence of Uncle Sam, and by the lessons harsh and silent that had become his only inheritance.

The kid sat on the sofa, staring toward the basement, his hand covering the corners of his mouth, masking any hint of expression. His head snapped toward the door at the sound of loud, insistent knocking.

Knock, knock. “Kid, get the fucking door!”

Knock, knock. “GET THE DOOR!”

“Give me a second,” the kid muttered, dragging himself toward the door. He opened it just a crack and saw a black boy standing there, a cross hanging around his neck.

“What do you want?” the kid asked.

“Talk about the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,” the black boy replied.

The kid shut the door slowly, then swung it wide open. A silver pistol gleamed at the black boy’s belt. His eyes locked on it, frozen. The kid readjusted his own pistol at his waist, letting it hang casually an unspoken threat.

“Is there an issue?” the black boy asked, his voice tight.

“No,” the kid replied, voice steady.

A heavy silence stretched between them. Sweat began to bead along the black boy’s forehead.

“Is there an issue?” he repeated, a little louder this time.

The kid tugged his pistol free and let it dangle loosely at his side.

“I gotta go,” the black boy said.

“What are you doing way out here?”

“Spreading the Lord’s name.”

“Does anyone know you’re here?”

“What?”

“Does anyone know you’re… why?”

“Why do you ask?”

The kid inhaled deeply, weighing the moment, then said, “Best you get out of here.”

The kid returned to the living room and, to his surprise, found Uncle Sam sitting on the sofa, eyes fixed on him. The kid lowered himself onto the couch across from him.

“Who was that?” Uncle Sam asked, his voice steady but probing.

“Don’t worry about it,” the kid replied, keeping his gaze low.

“I *will* worry about it. Who the hell was that?”

“Some black priest,” the kid said shortly.

“Did you tell him to back off?”

“Yeah.”

“Good.”

Later into the night, when the wolves howled deep in the dusk and the silhouettes of animals drifted pale beneath the moonlight, the kid remained awake. He lounged on the sofa, his fist propping up his skull, a bored expression smeared across his face. He had assumed Uncle Sam was asleep, but he very much was not.Then, a painful creak from the kitchen floorboards drew his attention. The kid’s eyes widened as he saw Uncle Sam emerge knife in his right hand, dressed in a white raincoat now drenched in a vivid red, as though soaked in blood.Uncle Sam’s gaze locked onto the kid, studying his frozen figure. Slowly, deliberately, he placed the knife in the sink and turned on the leaking faucet. Warm, cool blue water ran over his crimson-stained palms, melting the dark streaks into the sink.

“Hey, kid… don’t be scared,” Uncle Sam said, his voice low, almost a whisper, but carrying weight like a stone dropped into water. “Just had to skin a deer for dinner tomorrow.” His laugh was soft, hollow, but it lingered, curling around the edges of the room.

“Okay,” the boy muttered, barely audible, his throat tight.

Uncle Sam brought a cigarette to his lips and lit it. The small flare of the lighter illuminated his face for a split second sharp cheekbones, pale skin stretched over something larger than human.

“Come closer,” he said, slow and deliberate.

The boy obeyed, his legs stiff, his pulse hammering in his ears.

“What’s the matter? Come closer,” Uncle Sam repeated, his tone now sharper, almost a command.

The boy’s feet moved, but every step felt heavy, inevitable. There was no room to turn back.

Uncle Sam lifted his long, pale hand into the air, then let it drift down to the boy’s scalp. His fingers tangled in the boy’s hair, pressing, rubbing, controlling. He smiled, but the movement of his lips felt calculated, alien.

Without warning, Uncle Sam removed the cigarette from his mouth and pressed it against the boy’s lips. The kid inhaled sharply, choking on the smoke. It filled his lungs like fire, and he coughed violently, exhaling thick, gray clouds that clung to the air. His small hands covered his mouth, but the smoke burned through his senses.

Uncle Sam’s grin widened, stretching across his face like a crack in porcelain. Rows of silver-white teeth glinted in the dim light as his laughter spilled out, low and sinister, curling into the corners of the room. The boy didn’t understand why he was laughing. He didn’t want to. But still, he forced a laugh, small, shaky, a mirror of Uncle Sam’s, just to survive the silence that hung heavier than anything he had ever felt.

And through it all, the boy realized: he was trapped. Not by walls, not by hands but by the weight of Uncle Sam’s presence, by the certainty that whatever came next would be decided entirely by the man before him.

The next day, the boy woke to the sound of laughter. Uncle Sam sat sprawled on the sofa, his long frame almost swallowing it, while two police officers lounged beside him, laughing so loud it pulled the boy from sleep like a hand dragging him from water. He rubbed his eyes, each motion slow, hesitant, as though awakening fully would make the world collapse.

When he entered the living room, the officers held steaming cups of coffee or was it tea? their hands loose, casual, yet their laughter carried an edge he couldn’t place.

“Your dad’s funny,” one officer said, a grin cutting across his face.

“I’m his uncle,” Uncle Sam corrected, voice flat, calm, unbothered.

“Oh… that makes more sense,” the first officer chuckled. “My uncle was hilarious too.”

The boy stiffened. “What are you guys here for, anyway?” His voice cracked slightly, betraying the tension coiling in his chest.

The first officer’s face twisted into gravity. “Oh… it’s horrible.”

“Just horrible,” the second officer added, his voice carrying an unnatural weight.

“What happened?” the boy snapped, the question sharper than intended. Uncle Sam’s head tilted slightly, his eyes tracking the boy, unreadable, calculating.

“Six teenagers,” the first officer said slowly, as if the words themselves were knives. “Camping in the woods nearby… stabbed. More than fifty times.”

The boy’s stomach churned. “Jesus…” he whispered, a dry, rattling breath leaving his lips.

“How far from here?” he asked, his voice lower, more controlled.

“Ten yards, maybe,” the officer replied. “At least.”

The boy’s heart thumped violently, a horrid bubbling twisting inside him, cold and hot at once. Sweat gathered on his forehead; he shoved it away, tried to hide it, wiping the droplets with his elbow in a desperate, unconscious maneuver. But the officers’ words seemed to lodge themselves in his skull, a static hum behind his eyes, matched with heavy, ragged breathing that he could almost feel vibrating through the air. That gnawing ache the one that had been sitting quietly in his chest for years now filled his head entirely, pressing against the wrinkles of his brain.

“We better get going now,” one officer said, voice normal, casual, breaking the spell.

“Yeah, better get to it. Gotta lotta work ahead,” Uncle Sam replied, his tone steady, controlled.

“Nice meeting you, Samuel,” the first officer said, extending his hand. Uncle Sam took it with a slow, deliberate grip, shaking firmly.

Silence fell after the officers left, the echo of their boots fading into the distance.

“Crazy, ain’t it?” the boy muttered, eyes darting toward the spot where the officers had been.

“What?” Uncle Sam’s voice was calm, almost hollow.

“The teenagers… the ones who got stabbed. Crazy, ain’t it?”

“Oh… yeah,” Uncle Sam said, voice flat. “Horrible.”

The boy didn’t move. His heart still throbbed violently in his chest, the residual echo of their presence filling the room like a shadow he couldn’t shake.

Uncle Sam retreated to his room, leaving the boy alone in a pit of sweat, a storm thrashing violently in the back of his pupils. His chest heaved, but no tears came. The boy sat rigid on the sofa, thoughts twisting endlessly, looping over themselves like barbed wire in his skull. The wrinkles of his brain seemed to constrict with every passing second, mirroring the tightening of his fingers, the balling of his palms, the coiling of his arms each movement a desperate attempt to bury the enormous weight deeper into his stomach. He had been doing this for so long that the hours slipped away unnoticed; soon, night fell over the cabin like a heavy, suffocating shroud.

*Uncle Sam must be sleeping,* he told himself, eyes fixed on the basement the godforsaken basement, dark and forbidden. A place he was never allowed to enter. *Uncle Sam would never… he would never…*

A voice hissed in his mind, panicked and rising, echoing off the walls of his skull.

*He didn’t do it…*

*He didn’t do it…*

*HE DIDN’T DO IT!*

The words reverberated, vibrating through every nerve, until his thoughts became a hammering rhythm. His body tensed, his heart raced, and the storm inside him refused to relent, a tempest of fear, guilt, and something unnameable twisting him from the inside out.The boy tried desperately to drown out the terror clawing at the trenches of his soul. He stood, trembling slightly, and approached the basement. A black, suffocating darkness loomed before him, vast and unwelcoming. Each step down the rickety stairs was measured, cautious his toes testing the floorboards as though they could betray him.

*CREEEEK.*

The long, agonizing screech of a floorboard beneath his weight jolted him violently, sending sweat dripping down his spine and plunging him further into despair. Panic knotted in his chest as his eyes caught a thin, dangling string swaying silently in the darkness.

With tentative fingers, he tugged it. A weak, yellowish light flickered to life, cutting through the oppressive black like a trembling beacon. The light revealed a crudely fashioned door, embedded awkwardly into the side of the basement wall.Dust clung thickly to the concrete floor, coating his shoes in powdery gray. The wooden walls loomed like silent sentinels, empty yet whispering with the ghosts of forgotten things. The basement was barren, yet it seemed alive, holding its secrets close, daring him to uncover them.

The boy pushed the door open, letting it click shut behind him, and stepped into a dimly lit cell-like room. Shadows clung to the corners, bending and twisting in the pale light. He carefully descended the stone steps, each footfall deliberate, echoing faintly against the polished surface. Surprisingly, the room below was clean, almost meticulously maintained.

A small television sat in the corner, surrounded by stacks of DVDs. A bookshelf, orderly and unassuming, stood nearby. Yet the boy’s attention was drawn elsewhere a faint, almost imperceptible sound, a ripple of noise that didn’t belong to the hum of the TV or the quiet of the stone walls.

He scanned the room, heart pounding, trying to pinpoint its origin. Slowly, he pressed his ear against the bookshelf.

The sound that greeted him twisted something in his chest. A baby’s wail, sharp and raw, cut through the silence. Beneath it, there was something else a deeper, more guttural sound, violent and ragged. A sobbing voice, or maybe multiple voices, wracked with grief or agony, filling the space with a weight that pressed against his ribs, making it hard to breathe.The boy’s skin crawled. Every instinct screamed at him to flee, yet some thread of fear, or curiosity, kept him frozen against the shelf, listening, absorbing the unbearable sorrow that seemed to seep through the walls themselves.

The boy’s breaths began to overlap, shallow and rapid, each inhale and exhale colliding against the next. Sweat poured from his forehead, dripping to the floor like a leaking faucet, slicking the cold stone beneath him. Panic clawed at his chest, but a strange compulsion drove him forward.

He began yanking books from the shelves one by one, stacking them haphazardly, then returning them, over and over, his fingers trembling with urgency. Finally, a single book resisted the shelf, holding steady. He pushed against it, and half of the bookshelf swung open, revealing a dark, gaping entrance.

The cries hit him then shattering, raw, and unbearable. The sound seemed to tear at his chest, vibrating through his bones. Heart hammering, he stepped inside.

There, in the dim light, a woman appeared. Pregnant, familiar her face etched into his memory, yet horrifyingly altered by pain. She had six babies, each wailing violently, their tiny screams piercing the air. Her own sobs were loud, ragged, and unrelenting, each one a blade cutting through the room. Scars and bruises mottled her skin, maps of suffering and torment that spoke louder than words ever could.The boy froze, paralyzed between recognition and horror. The room seemed to shrink around him, every breath a struggle against the cacophony of cries, the weight of despair pressing on him like stone. He wanted to run, to scream, to tear the scene from his mind but something held him there, trapped in the undeniable reality of what he had found.

“Are you… Sam’s daughter?” the boy asked, his voice trembling.

The woman nodded, and her tears poured like an ocean from her eyes, spilling down her bruised cheeks.

“PLEASE… TAKE MY BABIES! PLEASE, GOD, TAKE MY CHILDREN! LET US OUT OF HERE!” she screamed, her voice jagged and raw, echoing off the stone walls.

The boy pressed a trembling finger to his lips. “He’s going to hear you… I’m… I’m so sorry. Just… please, whisper.”

“Please… take us. I’ve been here for years. I don’t even know how old I am… please,” she begged, her sobs rattling the floorboards.

Panic struck him like a hammer. Sweat poured from his temples and clung to his skin. He clasped his hands over his chest, feeling his heart hammer wildly, bouncing up and down like it wanted to escape. Anxiety carved itself into the tight wrinkles of his brain, making each thought scream louder than the last.

“I… I will,” he whispered, his voice strangled, deprived of air, each word clinging to his chest as if the very act of speaking might tear him apart. “I will come back. I promise.”

With trembling hands, he shut the hidden bookshelf door, retreating upstairs. Each step back felt heavier than the last, as if the weight of what he had seen followed him, rooting itself into his chest. Once in his room, he worked frantically to remove all evidence of the hidden chamber, shoving books back into place, trying to erase the nightmare he had uncovered.

The next morning, he sat at the kitchen table, cereal in front of him, fingers twitching nervously. Uncle Sam chewed loudly, oblivious, while the boy’s mind raced, haunted by the cries and the desperate faces of those he could not yet save.

“Hey, kid… you seen my pistol?” Uncle Sam’s voice sliced through the quiet kitchen like a knife.

The boy didn’t answer.

“Kid, my pistol! Where is it?” he snapped, the words snapping in the air like twigs underfoot.

“I… I can’t tell you that,” the boy stammered, his throat tight.

“Where is *my gun*?” The words hit harder this time, bouncing against the walls of the small kitchen.

Silence lingered, heavy and thick, pressing down like wet cloth on the boy’s shoulders.

“Upstairs… in my room,” the boy finally whispered.

“Where in your room?”

“The… closet,” he said, each word fragile.

Uncle Sam muttered under his breath but left it at that. Soon after, the two returned to their breakfast, the awkward tension dissolving only slightly into the sound of cereal being eaten. Uncle Sam scooped up a large, soggy handful and, between bites, said, “What do you think… some sort of badass or something?”

He laughed, a rough, booming sound, before shoving another bite into his mouth.

The boy hadn’t touched his cereal.

“What’s wrong with you? Eat your cereal it’s getting soggy,” Uncle Sam snapped.

“My bad,” the boy muttered, dipping his spoon hesitantly into the bowl.

Uncle Sam rolled up his sleeve, revealing a rectangular watch for a split second before covering it again. “I gotta go,” he said casually, walking toward the basement with the ease of a predator moving through its territory.

The boy’s gaze lingered over the dark shadows at the basement entrance, long and quiet, as Uncle Sam disappeared into the hidden cellular.Down below, the faint scent of dust and mildew clung to the air. Uncle Sam’s boots echoed softly against the concrete floor as he approached the bookshelves. His brow furrowed in confusion as he shifted one volume, then another, something had shifted.

Up above, the boy hovered in the doorway, cloaked in the delicate shadows, straining to hear.

POP! POP! The shots tore through the air like jagged lightning, rattling the walls and shaking the floor beneath him. The kid froze, a prickle crawling up his spine, his heart pounding so violently it felt like it might burst through his ribs.

He darted his gaze wildly toward the exit, the stairs, the shadows every corner a potential threat. His chest tightened, lungs burning as if the air itself were conspiring against him.

Panic clawed at his mind. He bolted upstairs, slamming the uncle sams bedroom door behind him, the echo of each shot still hammering through the house. His fingers shook uncontrollably as he yanked open drawers, tore through closets, desperate for a weapon anything to defend himself from the chaos downstairs.Below him, the floorboards groaned under the weight of unseen movement. The basement seemed alive, exhaling slow, menacing thuds that echoed through the house like the pulse of a monstrous heartbeat. Every creak, every whisper of movement was amplified in his mind, twisting the shadows into shapes that lunged at him.

A cold sweat ran down his back. His palms were slick, trembling over every surface, as if the walls themselves were closing in. The shots had stopped but the silence was worse, heavier, suffocating, broken only by the faint, deliberate scrape of something or someone moving far below, waiting.The kid’s breath came fast, ragged, slicing through the tense stillness. He felt trapped in a storm of fear, the house twisting into a labyrinth of dread. Every second stretched, stretched, stretched until it felt like the basement was no longer beneath him but everywhere around him, watching, waiting.

The kid cowered beneath the bed, pressed so close to the floor that every creak of the wooden planks sounded like the world itself was cracking apart. Dust motes floated in the slivers of light, but they were almost invisible to him, swallowed by the oppressive darkness. Each shallow breath felt like inhaling smoke, sharp and choking, as if the air itself wanted to crush him.The boots came first slow, deliberate, thudding against the floor with an intent that made the entire room vibrate. Each step was a hammer blow to the pit of his stomach. The walls leaned inward, dark corners stretching like claws, shadows thickening until they felt alive, crawling toward him.

“COME OUT!” Uncle Sam’s roar shattered the fragile silence. The sound didn’t just echo it slammed into the kid’s chest, rattling his bones and leaving a ringing in his ears that drowned out everything else. The floorboards groaned under the weight of Sam’s approach, creaking and whining like the house itself was warning the boy.

The kid’s pupils expanded to their limits, terror paralyzing him. Every instinct screamed to bolt, yet there was nowhere to run, only the narrow, suffocating prison of the bed.

Then the shadow fell. Uncle Sam’s looming figure stretched across the floor, immense and immovable. The kid could feel the cold brush of the rifle’s metal as it swung lazily, a silent predator, waiting. And then the teeth the great, unnerving white teeth, spread into a grin that radiated malice, gleaming even in the dim light, sharper than any knife.

A hand clamped down on the kid’s scalp. Iron. Pain. Terror. His scream ripped out, raw and wild, bouncing off the walls, swallowed by the shadows. The fingers dug in, lifting him off the floor with inhuman strength, as the bedframe groaned in protest beneath them.

“SHUT UP!” Uncle Sam bellowed. His face was close enough for the kid to see the cruel flex of muscles, the twitch of a vein on his temple, the gleam in his eye that promised absolute control. The room seemed to shrink around him, the air thickening, pressing against his chest, squeezing the oxygen from his lungs. The shadows stretched, elongated, coiling around the bedposts and walls, as if they, too, hungered for him.

The kid’s body quaked, every nerve screaming, fingers clawing at the floor, searching for anything, anything to hold onto. The house itself felt alive the walls breathing, the floorboards whispering warnings, the air vibrating with the echo of Uncle Sam’s fury. Every heartbeat pounded like a drum of doom, each second stretching, elongating, suffocating.

And all the while, that grin the white, predatory grin never left, as the kid dangled helpless, terror pouring into him like molten fire, filling every hollow of his being.

The room was no longer a room. It was a cage, a predator, a living nightmare and the boy was trapped inside, every inch of him consumed by the presence that could crush him without effort, that could end him with a flick of a hand.

The kid lashed out, fists hammering into Uncle Sam’s stomach, each strike met with a deep, hideous laugh that seemed to echo through the walls, bouncing like jagged shards of metal. Pain bloomed across the boy’s knuckles, burning and raw, but he refused to stop, driven by some impossible mixture of fear and defiance.

Then the cold, unyielding butt of the rifle slammed into his gut, and he crumpled against the floorboards. The wood groaned beneath their combined weight as Uncle Sam pressed him down, his immense body pinning the trembling boy in place. The kid flailed, arms and legs swinging like a headless chicken, each movement only tightening Sam’s grip, crushing him into the floorboards, forcing the air from his lungs.

“Why?” Uncle Sam’s voice cut through the chaos, sharp and ragged, almost pleading. “Why do you do this to yourself? Why does everyone trust me, yet I’m so lonely, so empty, no matter who’s with me? Why?” His hands dug into the floor beside the boy, bracing, every muscle taut. His eyes burned with something unnatural, a mixture of rage, despair, and hunger.

“Why do you want to trust me?” he continued, voice dropping to a low, dangerous rasp. “You know I’m not human. I don’t think I ever was. Everybody knew… nobody cared.”

The boy struggled beneath him, each breath a scream trapped in his chest, the floorboards splintering under the weight and fury of their collision. Fear, confusion, and something darker an understanding he couldn’t yet name twisted in the pit of his stomach. Every flail, every punch, was swallowed by the sheer, suffocating presence of Uncle Sam.

And in that crushing, unending moment, it became impossible to tell where the boy ended and the terror began.

Uncle Sam snarled, the sound tearing through the night like metal scraping bone. Then he smiled, and it twisted into a laugh a hideous, alien sound, more scream than mirth, echoing across the deadened landscape. The air itself seemed to shiver in terror at it.

The boy had reached the end of the road. The road that had carried him through fifteen short, shattered years had abruptly ended at the edge of a still, black lake. Every heartbeat pounded in his chest like a funeral drum, each gasp of air tasting like ash.

Without hesitation, Uncle Sam seized the boy, his massive hands unflinching, merciless. The cold night air bit at his skin as he hurled the boy’s naked body into the dark water. The lake swallowed him immediately, the surface rippling once before smoothing into an impenetrable black mirror. No scream lingered. No struggle remained. Only silence.The boy was gone. Forever lost, a shadow erased from the world, leaving nothing behind but the echo of a laugh alien, unearthly, and utterly final.

He never sleeps. Uncle Sam never trust him, kids. He’s not human, and he never was. He contains that of flesh and bones, but something deep within is anything but human. He never sleeps. He is there in the light and hides in the darkness. You may know him, you may not, but always remember: **Uncle Sam never sleeps.**

1muy4ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/askmanagers/comments/1muy4ek/dealing_with_a_terrible_manager/,Dealing with a terrible manager,"Hi,

Not sure if this is the right place to bring this up to but here it goes. I work for an MSP as a Project Coordinator. I'm going to get my PMP soon. It's a small to medium sized company. 

Technically my manager is the lead PM and then we both fall under the Delivery Lead. My issue is that they both suck. The delivery lead will retire next year so doesn't give a shit about anything and the lead PM is such a terrible PM. She does not communicate clearly or at all, passes of all the administrative tasks to me or the ones she doesn't want to deal with and she slacks off.

 I know she slacks off because she posts on Instagram being out for coffee or at the gym while she is supposed to be working (we WFH). And she has a lot of people from work as friends there so many people know. And I know management also knows.

What I don't know is if they are doing anything about it.

Anyway, I digress! Other than those 2 there is the CEO that is pretty approachable, 2-3 account managers and the COO that are higher than the delivery manager.

I like working there because it's not a stressful environment and there are opportunities to move up if you are good at what you do so I don't want to leave but having to work with these 2 is a nightmare.

What would you advise that I do here? I've tried talking to them but it didn't really change anything.

I've been trying to find another job for the past several months. I get my last paycheck for teaching soon and then I'll officially have no income. 

I've applied for all manner of jobs with no success. Been rejected from administration jobs because there's always another candidate with more relevant experience. Been rejected from grocery stores and coffee shops, presumably because I'm overqualified. I walked into town today and handed out my CV to a few local places, none of them said they're hiring currently. I have two degrees and I'm out here begging for minimum wage jobs.

I'm now realising that I've lived an incredibly sheltered and privileged life thus far. My parents are decently well off so I've never had to worry about money. I'm lucky that I'm living with them currently and can stay here until I find a job. But what if that wasn't the case? Getting a job feels impossible. If I was relying on it to survive- which I'm fortunately not right now- I can totally understand how I might end up on the streets or addicted to drugs just to cope with it. fuck, if I was homeless, I think I'd just walk into a police station and commit a crime in front of them, at least I'd have food and shelter if I was in prison. my other option currently is to go back to teaching, where I used to fantasise about getting hit by a truck on the way to work 😅",21,1755644702.0,recruitinghell,7,1.0,False

I’ve recently come to the conclusion im ready to find something real. I miss having a person to call my own. Someone to brighten my day. Someone I can’t wait to talk to. Someone whose attention is mine and I can’t have to love. Im open to the possibility but I’m not sure I’ll find that here.

So… I also miss having a best friend. I don’t think they’re mutually exclusive but I’m happy to settle for a friend to spend the lonely nights with. Someone to just talk about my day with. Someone to joke and sing with and just have time with. I’m pretty lonely lately and dealing with a great deal of feelings I rather ignore for the night. I don’t like texting but love voice chatting. Hopefully this time around I have some luck? 🤞

I’m 32 male and straight. Politically liberal. From nyc. I like to say I enjoy the gym but I enjoy the distraction from the mental mess. I like reading though I’m always up for recommendations. My music taste is very varied. I love sharing and talking about music. I love Italian and Mexican food and enjoy cooking it for others. I’m bipolar and actively working on the stuff that comes with it. I like going to live shows. I love dogs and miss having one. Don’t like avocados pickles or mustard. Love everything bagels. Don’t drink coffee. 420 friendly.  I talk a lot and I’m regularly available. 

I just want to build a real connections with someone who is also in need of some support and friendship. Perk of being my friend? I don’t sleep. I’ll always be around 😎

1muy2ns,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1muy2ns/explore_the_oxo_brew_9_cup_coffee_maker_review/,Explore the OXO Brew 9 Cup Coffee Maker review and its brewing precision!,"The OXO 8710100 Brew Coffee Maker, also known as the OXO Brew 9 Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker, has been brewing my mornings for weeks now. As someone who takes coffee seriously, I was eager to see how this highly-rated drip coffee machine stacked up to my expectations. It’s not just a coffee maker, it’s a piece of kitchen tech designed for precise brewing. Let’s talk about how it performs and a few quirks you should know about before making the leap.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Practical Design**  
The sleek silver stainless steel finish immediately caught my eye. It’s one of those devices that looks right at home on a minimalist kitchen counter, but its black and silver tones are versatile enough to match various styles. While the coffee maker might seem a little bulky with its dimensions (8.3""D x 15""W x 17.2""H), the design is deliberate. Every component serves a purpose, from the intuitive dial for programming cycles to the Rainmaker shower head which evenly disperses water over coffee grounds. Small design details, like the double-wall thermal carafe, aren’t just functional but feel premium. At 10.5 pounds, moving it around isn’t a breeze, but luckily, it has a solid, sturdy build that speaks to quality craftsmanship.

**BetterBrew Precision: The Coffee's Hot, But Is It Perfect?**  
This coffee maker touts BetterBrew Precision, and I felt like a scientist watching it control water temperature between 197.6–204.8°F with millisecond precision. The temperature consistency makes a noticeable difference in the coffee's flavor profile. The taste is robust yet smooth, no burnt aftertaste—fans of bold drip coffee will find this feature worth celebrating. However, while it does a phenomenal job at brewing larger quantities, I noticed it struggles slightly with smaller servings when compared to other single-serve brewers I’ve used.

[**Check OXO 8710100 Brew Coffee Maker price on Amazon.**](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00yeykk8u/)

**Convenient Yet Thoughtful Features**  
This coffee maker surprised me with its simplicity in operation. A single dial handles everything: number of cups, programming the wake-up timer, and selecting brewing options. Even my tech-challenged relative had no issues operating it (though they did appreciate a quick walkthrough). Pause-and-pour elevates its usability; simply pause halfway through the brewing process to grab a quick cup if patience isn’t your virtue. The freshness indicator on the carafe was a small touch but oddly satisfying to have, especially during those lazy Saturday mornings when I wondered if I made the coffee two hours ago or just one.

**Strengths of This Coffee Maker**  
- Consistent water temperature enhances coffee flavor.  
- Rainmaker shower head ensures even saturation for better extraction.  
- Sturdy, stainless steel thermal carafe keeps coffee piping hot for hours.  
- Fully programmable, making it ideal for early birds who need hassle-free mornings.

**Critiques Worth Noting**  
For all its brilliance, this machine does have a few quirks:  
- It's a bit noisy during the brewing cycle. I noticed this especially because I brew in the early morning when the rest of the house is quiet.  
- Paper filters are necessary, which may annoy those hoping for a built-in mesh filter.  
- Though programming is straightforward, the absence of smartphone integration feels outdated in this price bracket.  

**Peer Products in the Market**  
Comparing this coffee maker to competitors like the Technivorm Moccamaster and Cuisinart DCC-3200, the OXO Brew holds its ground well, especially with its superior temperature control and the internal mixing tube that offers consistent flavor to the last sip. The Moccamaster may edge out the OXO in professional-level brewing but comes at a significantly higher cost. The Cuisinart model offers better affordability but lacks the precision water temperature control you'll find with the OXO Brew. Depending on your priorities, the OXO might find the perfect balance of features versus cost.

**Price Worthiness**  
Speaking of cost-effectiveness, this coffee maker feels like it targets serious coffee enthusiasts who'd consider spending extra for features like SCA certification and thoughtful design touches. Is it a bargain? Not exactly. But it’s certainly worth the investment if you care about getting consistent, gold-standard coffee brewing at home. Those who aren’t super particular about specialty coffee might find better value with basic models, but this is definitely tailored for the discerning coffee-lover.

1muy2mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1muy2mj/does_the_oxo_9_cup_coffee_maker_review_reveal/,Does the OXO 9 Cup Coffee Maker review reveal ultimate brewing precision?,"The OXO 8710100 Brew Coffee Maker, also known as the OXO Brew 9 Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker, became a part of my daily coffee routine a little over a month ago. As someone who’s very particular about coffee, I was curious to see if this brewer could live up to the buzz it’s garnered online. Spoiler: It’s impressive, though not without its quirks. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that grabbed my attention was how sleek and modern this machine looks. The combination of silver stainless steel and black detailing gives it a premium feel. It doesn’t just look good; it feels durable too. At 10.5 pounds, it’s sturdy enough to inspire confidence without being a hassle to move. Its dimensions (8.3""D x 15""W x 17.2""H) make it more compact than some other drip coffee makers I've used, fitting easily into my kitchen. Also, the intuitive design of the dial for programming is a refreshing change. It’s simple, clean, and doesn’t feel gimmicky.  

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Brewing coffee with this machine is ridiculously easy. The single dial lets you set the number of cups, the automatic wake-up timer, and other basic functions. Even my sleep-deprived self on a Monday morning could operate it without resorting to the manual. The pause-and-pour feature quickly became my favorite, especially when I’m in a rush. Imagine staring at the brewing coffee and debating whether to wait or grab a quick cup — problem solved! On the downside, I realized that the paper filters needed for the coffee maker were not included. It’s not a dealbreaker but does feel like corner-cutting.

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
Where this coffee maker truly shines is in its brewing precision. Thanks to OXO’s BetterBrew technology, the machine keeps water between 197.6°F and 204.8°F during the brew cycle — an optimal temperature range. The Rainmaker showerhead is a genius little feature, evenly dispersing water over the coffee grounds for maximum extraction. This ensures that every cup is rich and flavorful, whether it’s two cups or a full pot. The internal mixing tube in the carafe ensures uniform flavor, meaning the last cup doesn’t end up bland or burnt tasting.  

**Strengths**  
- The thermal carafe is double-walled, keeping coffee hot for hours without compromising flavor.  
- Programmable wake-up timer makes mornings seamless.  
- Gold-standard brewing certification from the SCA is a big plus.  
- Consistently balanced flavor due to even water distribution and mixing tube design.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Small water reservoir opening makes refilling trickier than it needs to be.  
- No reusable filter included, which would have been an eco-friendly touch.  
- Freshness timer could use better visibility — minor gripe but worth mentioning.  

**Competitors**  
To compare it with other top-tier drip coffee makers like the Technivorm Moccamaster and the Breville Precision Brewer, the OXO Brew holds its own very well. It excels in simplicity and overall brewing quality but falls short when it comes to customization. While the Breville Precision Brewer allows tweaking nearly every aspect of brewing, the OXO Brew focuses more on automated quality. On the other hand, it’s notably more affordable than a Technivorm Moccamaster with similar performance, making it the middle ground between premium and practical.  

**Value for Money**  
The price-point of this brewer, while on the higher end of the spectrum, feels fair considering the quality of coffee it produces and its sleek, functional design. It’s not a budget pick, but if you care about consistently great coffee and excellent build quality, the investment feels fully justified. Plus, with its durability, you won’t need to replace it anytime soon, so in that sense, it’s a cost-efficient option.

The OXO 8710100 Brew Coffee Maker boasts a minimalist aesthetic with its silver stainless steel finish and sleek black accents. Sitting prominently in my kitchen, it strikes a perfect balance between elegance and functionality. It's not just good-looking but also practical. Its compact footprint of 8.3"" x 15"" x 17.2"" fits well on my counter without hogging space, yet it doesn’t skimp on capacity. This coffee maker doesn’t trade off style for utility—its colors, materials, and design tie together effortlessly.

**User-Friendly Interface and Settings**  
I always appreciate kitchen gadgets that I can use without needing a master’s degree, and this coffee maker gets it right. The single dial system simplifies controls, making operations like choosing cup quantity, programming brew times, and activating the automatic wake-up timer intuitive. The display is clear and thoughtfully positioned to easily glance at setup details. Moreover, the ""pause and pour"" feature has proven handy during my hectic mornings when patience isn’t an option.

[Check OXO 8710100 Brew Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00yeykk8u/)

**Advanced Brewing Technology**  
It’s not all about appearances; this coffee maker takes brewing seriously. The BetterBrew Precision Brewing feature fine-tunes water temperature (197.6–204.8°F) and optimizes brew cycles, ensuring that whether I’m making two cups or a full pot, the quality doesn’t waver. The Rainmaker showerhead evenly distributes water over the grounds, providing me with a consistently bold and flavorful coffee every time. The way it ensures even extraction is something coffee enthusiasts will truly appreciate.

**Thermal Carafe for Heat Retention**  
Having experienced lukewarm coffee from lesser machines, the double-wall stainless steel thermal carafe on this unit is a lifesaver. It genuinely keeps my coffee hot for hours. I do wish it came with a glass option for those who prefer to see how much coffee remains, but the thermal setup effectively preserves flavor and temperature across time.

**Advantages**  
Reflecting on my daily use, some key benefits stood out:  
- Fully automatic operation makes brewing seamless.  
- Certified by the SCA for gold-standard home brewing.  
- Freshness timer provides a quick visual on when the coffee was brewed.  

**Flaws**  
However, not everything about this coffee maker is ideal, and no product is free of drawbacks:  
- The paper filter might be a downside for those who prefer reusable options.  
- The brewing process takes slightly longer compared to more basic models.  
- It has a 120V voltage requirement, so it’s less versatile for international use.  

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing it with other drip coffee machines like the Technivorm Moccamaster and Breville Precision Brewer brings some interesting insights. While the Technivorm offers a handmade approach and exceptional durability, its design feels clunkier than the clean aesthetic of this unit. Breville’s model offers more customizable features, but the price point often leans higher. The OXO Brew hits a sweet middle ground, balancing premium brewing with user-friendly features at a relatively attractive cost.

**Bang for the Buck**  
With high-tech brewing, thermal carafe features, and smart user interfaces, the OXO 8710100 Brew Coffee Maker punches above its weight. It doesn’t come cheap, but its reliability and rich feature set make it feel like a sensible investment for coffee enthusiasts and casual drinkers alike. It offers a fair price-to-quality ratio, especially when compared to luxury coffee makers in the market.

So TLDR: basically the title; anyone else having blood sugar issues with all of this or is it a coincidence/bad luck?  
34 f, TT  with central and left modified radical neck dissections on June 16th, 2025, diagnosed via Bethesda VI fna biopsy with ptc tall cell variant with lymph node metastasis on May 23rd.  For whatever reason that I don’t fully understand it wasn’t tested for genetic mutations (I guess they don’t send it for afirma when it’s Bethesda VI) but the endocrinologist believes there may be (braff?) mutation involvement because of its quick growth. I had several neck CT’s and MRI’s for spinal issues, and even an ultrasound for swollen lymph nodes between February 2022 and July 2024 and there was nothing to be seen on imaging until April 2025. In April it was 1.3cm and by June it was 2.1cm. The surgeon, oncologist, and endocrinologist even went back to look specially for that out of curiosity after we found the nodule and had the positive biopsy and they didn’t see it. Before we do RAI the endocrinologist is trying to get insurance approval to run the biopsy sample and/or the tumor/cancerous lymph nodes themselves to check for mutations. 
Anyway, I’m off topic, sorry, I’m having a really hard time getting my tsh down. Before surgery tsh was .4 then it was 2 about 3-4 weeks after surgery.  They went ahead and increased the levo dosage because they want it suppressed to below .5 but preferably below .1. Five weeks later and it’s over 30. I have been having symptoms like extreme fatigue, my whole body is tired- I feel like I’m walking through quicksand, brain fog, forgetfulness, severe depression, little bit of weight gain, constant headaches, my whole body aches always, and much more so I knew something wasn’t right. I’ve also had episodes where I’ll just get so tired that I almost feel drunk or something, I’ll get kind of dizzy, and just feel really weird feeling. I thought it was all hypothyroidism but with my last labs my blood glucose was in the 50s at 3 pm. It’s important to note that this isn’t the first time it’s been pretty low but this time I know for a fact that I had eaten about 2.5 hours before they did labs. I actually ate really well too, I’ve had some issues with food (nausea, vomiting, constipation) and I have adhd so there’s a lot of times I’ll simply forget to eat or just eat a couple bites here and there because I’m afraid to get sick. But, the day in question I had eaten a whole roast beef sandwich, a few fries, most of an apple turnover, and a few sips of coke too. It’s not the healthiest thing but a significant portion for me. Blood sugar spikes 2-3 hours post meal so it should have been great or maybe even high. In hindsight, I think I’ve been having reactive hypoglycemia episodes for several months. I think that’s possibly been most of my issue with food. Has anyone had blood sugar issues with all of this or is it just more bad luck? I know the thyroid controls a lot more than we realize. 
Since I’m already rambling 😅, does anyone have any advice for helping the thyroid meds absorb better? 
I take it every morning at 5:30 am with a sip of water and lie back down for another 45 minutes, then get in the shower and dressed before I even have coffee. I don’t eat for several hours after. I do still take 2 tums twice a day but not until about 11-noon and again at about 6ish pm. I don’t think I’m doing anything wrong but I’m not sure. 
If you’ve made it this far, I appreciate your time and patience. 
Thank you all for everything.

1muy110,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1muy110/does_the_oxo_brew_9_cup_coffee_maker_review_prove/,Does the OXO Brew 9 Cup Coffee Maker Review Prove Worth the Hype?,"The **OXO 8710100 Brew 9 Cup Coffee Maker** entered my kitchen not long ago, and I've been putting it through its paces daily. It’s not often that I find myself testing something with ""9-cup capacity convenience"" while also scrutinizing the tiny nuances of coffee brewing. I can confidently say this machine offers plenty to love, but there are some quirks to note. Hang tight for the flavorful pros and bitter cons.

**Design and Build Quality**  
What immediately struck me was the sleek aesthetic. The silver stainless steel exterior gives it a modern, minimalist vibe that fits right into a contemporary kitchen. Its dimensions—8.3 inches deep, 15 inches wide, and 17.2 inches high—make it a bit of a counter hog, so plan your space accordingly. I found the build solid; it doesn’t feel flimsy like some lightweight machines. However, at 10.5 pounds, it’s not something you’ll want to move around often. It has a professional, durable build while still looking stylish.

**Ease of Use**  
The intuitive interface surprised me. There’s a single dial to manage everything—whether you want a single cup or to program the automatic wake-up timer. The learning curve is nearly flat. Even my coffee-averse significant other figured it out with zero complaints. The display shows the brew cycle progress and a freshness timer to monitor when coffee was made. This feature is a lifesaver for people who habitually leave their coffee sitting (hi, that’s me).  

**See OXO 8710100 deals on Amazon now.**  

**Performance and Brewing Precision**  
Performance-wise, this coffee maker seriously delivers. Its BetterBrew™ Precision ensures water is heated between 197.6 and 204.8 degrees Fahrenheit, which is exactly the sweet spot endorsed by coffee aficionados. The Rainmaker shower head feature evenly distributes water over the coffee grounds, ensuring flavor extraction throughout the brewing process. I enjoyed the consistency of my coffee every time—whether I made a two-cup mini-batch or filled the full 9-cup thermal carafe.  

Let’s talk about carafe performance. Thanks to the double-wall stainless steel thermal design, my brewed coffee stayed hot for at least an hour and warm for upwards of two. Plus, the internal mixing tube evens out the brew to ensure the last sip is as good as the first. I appreciate small touches like this.  

**Strengths**  
- Uniform flavor extraction from the Rainmaker shower head.  
- Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) certification backs its golden-standard performance.  
- Precise temperature control for brewing excellence.  
- Fully automatic and programmable with an easy-to-use dial.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Bulky for small kitchens; might struggle for counter real estate.  
- Weight at over 10 pounds makes it less portable.  
- It only works with paper filters, no reusable filter option.  

**Target Users**  
This machine seems tailor-made for coffee purists who care about consistency in their brews. Whether you’re brewing a mug for work-at-home mornings or filling the carafe for weekend brunch, it’ll handle it all effortlessly. That said, casual coffee drinkers scoffing at anything beyond a basic drip might feel it’s overkill. I genuinely found it to suit my lifestyle as someone perpetually chasing the ""perfect brew,"" with just a few hiccups for more space-challenged kitchens.  

**Competing Products**  
If I were to compare this coffee maker with its peers, two come to the forefront: the Technivorm Moccamaster and the Breville Precision Brewer. The Moccamaster offers a more handmade, retro experience with excellent brew quality, while the Breville dives deeper into customization for those wanting very specific coffee settings. However, neither matches the OXO’s straightforward simplicity. In terms of performance, it’s on par with both options but falls just short due to its heavy reliance solely on paper filters, whereas others might offer reusable filter compatibility.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Although pricing fluctuates, its value proposition holds strong. Considering the features—optimal temperature control, rain head design, thermal carafe quality, and SCA certification—the price feels justified. It’s for someone investing in both convenience and coffee quality rather than pinching pennies for an entry model. Budget coffee makers may brew your caffeine fix, but they won’t deliver coffee shop-quality results like this gem.

I have a male friend that is like a brother to me. At no time have we ever entertained or made an attempt to cross any lines…making that clear…he has been such a huge emotional support to me and my husband hates him. We have know each other since we were kids and grew up together. 

We often times work together often and each time I go to meet my friend for work or just coffee my husband has a full out hissy fit! I often feel like I’m treating my friend like a side dude because of house my husband reacts. My husband swears up and down that we secretly want each other when that can’t be farther from the truth. He becomes irrationally mad when my friend’s name is mentioned or in their presence he tenses up so bad it’s noticeable. My husband honestly doesn’t like most of my friends…but really can’t stand this one. 

But the crazy part is when my husband is around me he barely talks to me and looks at me like I’m gum on his shoe. We can go days without speaking at length if I don’t interact with him. But the moment someone else outside of the kids wants to spend time with me it’s a problem. Now my friend is no angel and is a single person that has had affairs with married women in the past, but once again there is nothing between us.

Something I love to do during my morning coffee, walks in the park, or when it’s slow at work.

Different people, discovering their own lives. It’s fascinating to me.

Usually I don’t remember anyone…only seeing them once. But you, I remember.

Sipping my morning coffee, I noticed you always slowed down during the spring to look at the blooming flowers. Admiring the emerging petals, excited to see what beautiful creation it would turn into.

Chrysanthemums.

Those were your favorite.

I never got mad when you picked them from my front garden, unlike my grumpy neighbors. You sang to old rock music, with a voice that even the bird would hang around too listen, while their  precious babies would be crying for food.

You picked up trash you had come across left from the reckless teenagers up the hill. Said hello to early morning joggers. Even brought your own treats to feed to the stray cats that hung around the corner.

You seemed so kind-hearted.

I always wondered where you were walking too, to your day job, I had assumed…

When I stopped seeing you, my first thought was you had quit to work some place else. Perhaps you found a better paying job more in the city.

I could see you working in the fashion industry, based off your unique choice of clothing.

Maybe you fell in love with someone and moved across the country…

That, I hope not. Because even though I never met you, it felt like I was falling in love.

The way you admired earths creations, the light hitting your eyes making it look like a pot of honey…the way you walked with confidence…

I wished the best for you, on whatever journey you were embarking…

I started to notice other things once you stopped coming around. A family of squirrels had a routine of grabbing nuts from the oak tree hanging above my porch. They would chase each other around until one got a stomach ache, then run back under my neighbors fence.

But nothing is as interesting as you.

I missed seeing you.

So I’ll write it here for now.

To remember.

When I saw you on the news, that’s the first time I learned your name.

Anna.

What a beautiful name…

From all the pictures, videos and comments I saw, I knew you were loved by many.

So this, I never would have expected.

It’s crazy that I saw you everyday, creating a narrative about you in my head. But this was never part of it.

I’m sorry Anna. I’m sorry I never once introduced myself to be your friend. I’m sorry this world is so cruel. I’m sorry I couldn’t save you from the harsh reality of what we call life. I’m sorry you didn’t get a fair chance for yourself to become happier…

I’ll promise I’ll collect all the Chrysanthemums I ever come across for the rest of my time, to honor you Anna.
