Which MPC is the best for someone who just wants to get up early on a Saturday morning, make a coffee, record some samples and make some beats throughout the week? Im not interested too much in the VSTs or add ons, I have some synths and drum machines I enjoy. Im just looking for something that helps me paint with audio, all I wanna do is use it for sampling. Is the new models better for editing and sampling? Is vintage the way to go? Peace",1,1764778681.0,mpcusers,0,1.0,False

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message and introduce yourself !

1pd8hyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayMoneyMindset/comments/1pd8hyo/forget_budgeting_apps_this_is_how_i_track_my/,Forget Budgeting Apps. This Is How I track My Finances,"https://preview.redd.it/p97npthek05g1.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42f1ba43afabe279eb42527945b85ab67d6211aa

Friend, I used to track my personal finances like a forensic accountant with a caffeine problem.

I had 7 apps, 4 spreadsheets, and a color-coded system that required a PhD in Excel to maintain.

I knew where every penny went.

And I still had $400 in savings and a persistent feeling that I was missing something.

The problem wasn't my tracking.

It was that **I was tracking the wrong thing.**

I was tracking *numbers*.

I should have been tracking *lies*.

Here's the system I actually use now.

It fits in a shoebox.

It takes 15 minutes a week.

And it turned my financial life from a mystery novel into a children's book with one clear moral: **Stop lying to yourself.**

# 👉The System: The Receipt Confession Box

Every Saturday, I throw every receipt from the week into an old Nike shoebox next to the door.

Gas station coffee, online order, ATM withdrawal, everything.

If there's no receipt, I scribble the amount on a Post-It and toss it in.

**Every Sunday morning,** before I do anything else (before I check my phone, before I let the world in), I pour coffee, grab the box, and pick **three receipts at random.**

For each one, I answer **three questions out loud:**

1. **""What did I buy?""** (If I can't remember, immediate shame pile.)
2. **""Did this make my life genuinely better in a lasting way?""** (If I hesitate, shame pile.)
3. ""If I could go back, would I buy it again?"" (If the answer is no, shame pile.)

The shame pile doesn't go in the trash. It gets taped to my fridge.

Not as punishment.

As data.

# 👉Why This Works (And Apps Don't)

Apps track categories: ""Food: $387.""

Cool.

What does that tell you?

Nothing.

Did you spend $387 on groceries that fed you for a week, or $387 on 14 impulse runs to 7-Eleven?

The app doesn't know.

It just smugly reports the number like that's useful.

**Receipts are specific.**

They say: ""$8.47, Shell Gas Station, 7:13 AM. Sausage McMuffin, Red Bull.""

You **remember** that.

You were late.

You were tired.

You made a choice.

And now you're saying it out loud to your empty kitchen, and it sounds... small.

Embarrassing.

Not evil.

Just... not aligned with who you want to be.

The act of saying it out loud is confession.

It externalizes the choice.

You become the witness to your own spending.

And being witnessed?

That's what changes behavior.

Apps make you feel watched by an algorithm.

The shoebox makes you feel watched by **yourself.**

One creates resentment.

The other creates awareness.

Only one of those leads to change.

# 👉The Glow-Up: Making It Actually Stick

You don't need a fancy box.

You need **ritual and friction.**

**Step 1: The Physical Trigger**

Keep the box **in a place you can't ignore.**

Mine is next to the door.

I see it every morning.

It's a visual reminder that Sunday is coming, and Sunday is judgment day.

But like, nice judgment.

The kind your grandma does.

**Step 2: The 3-Question Card**

Write the questions on an index card.

Keep it in the box.

**Read them out loud.**

Hearing your own voice say ""Did this make my life better?"" is a different experience than thinking it.

Your voice carries weight.

Use it.

**Step 3: The Social Contract**

Once a month, **text a friend a photo of your shame pile.**

""This is what I spent money on that I regret.""

You don't need advice.

You just need a witness.

The fear of having to send that text makes you pause at checkout.

**Step 4: The ""One Thing"" Cut**

From your shame pile, pick **ONE category** to cut next month.

Not everything.

Just one.

""No more gas station breakfast sandwiches.""

That's it.

That's the whole budget.

My shame pile showed me I was spending $80/month on ""treats"" after bad days.

I cut it to $20.

I didn't feel deprived.

I just... stopped medicating with snacks.

# 👉The Bottom Line

**You're Not Lazy. You're Just Unwatched.**

Most tracking systems fail because they require **discipline.**

Discipline is a finite resource you use up by 10 AM not quitting your job.

The shoebox doesn't require discipline.

It requires **ritual.**

Rituals are automatic.

Rituals are sticky.

Rituals turn ""tracking"" into ""witnessing.""

And witnessing yourself?

That's the only habit that ever changed anything for good.",1,1764778527.0,EverydayMoneyMindset,0,1.0,False
1pd8hoc,https://i.redd.it/0pftn7mkk05g1.jpeg,First and worst bad review ever at new gig,"Story goes like this:
My background is 8 years of high volume restaurant by the beach in St Augustine, Fla.
Now new in Annapolis, MD. Taken a year of due to moving states, buying house, doing remodel projects for myself and others. Also suffering with chronic pain (pudendal neuralgia) after surgeries gone wrong in 2022.

Couple in their 40s come in during lunch. I’m on my second double b2b, during my first week after training at a French restaurant. 
They ask about wine, I got them set up with samples. They ordered an appetiser and I ordered that. When I come back with the wine, they ask where the app is.. They start asking questions about our trout dish and a benedict platter. I answered those questions and asked if they wanted to order it. They said they were good with the app and wine for now. When the app shows up I ask them if they needed anything else. Said they were good.
I go and check like 5 times, asking if I could do anything else for them. They’re “good”.
Our family meal comes out, we eat. I check on them again, and suddenly it happens: “Where’s our food?”
I told them I was confused, I never rang anything in. They were confused as well. I told them I could still make it happen. But they wanted the check, understandably. When I went to the computer, he follows me, starts complaining. I told him I was sorry but I also checked on them like 5 times. I said it was a misunderstanding. Guy proceeds to say things like: “what am I gonna do now, I’m on a date with a fine woman,” and “this says a lot about your character”. Told him that was unfair and it was a misunderstanding and apologised. 
They leave and 30 minutes later this.

Things to know: I don’t drink. I have never had a bad review online. Feeling horrible about this. Management understands but still, not used to being dragged through the mud like that. 

Also, they didn’t know what type of wine they like but go to a French place. Never did they ask about the food in 40 minutes. And who says things like: I’m on a date with a fine woman lmao. Sounded cringey. Feeling like he just wanted to prove himself. And threw everything at me he possibly could in a review cause he had a glass of wine and felt like he needed to impress his date.
Still overall depressed with my life because of my condition and this doesn’t help. New job, new motions. Doing bar drinks now for first time, including coffees. Been feeling suicidal lately because of stress in relationship, my condition and the new job. I’ve had an incredibly stressful year. Please talk some sense into me on my day off.

I am going to try and be brief but thorough here. Just need some advice/options

I am more of a filtered coffee person (I currently use an Aeropress most of the time). I started making this one drink in the morning that is kind of a breakfast replacement, and so with the other ingredients, the coffee flavor is very subtle, especially from the Aeropress. I have a Nespresso machine, and so I tried the drink with 4 shots as the recipe called for and it's definitely a lot better! The thing is, I am way past my Nespresso and really, by the time I spend the crapload of money on the capsules, I'd rather just stop at a coffee shop and get good stuff. 

Anyways, I want to get something that will make good, bold, tasty espresso, but I don't want to spend a lot of money. Got a $100 Amazon gift card from work and thought to use that for it. I wouldn't mind adding a little money, but again, not too much (maybe another $50?)

I am open to different methods, as long as I can make easily make the four shots and it's nothing that will take me half an hour to clean every day.

Hi pooo! 👋🏼
I’m a young EE engineer (well… still baby engineer vibes haha), and lately napapaisip talaga ako about something we all deal with in the Philippines:

Bakit ang hirap maging power-efficient country? 😭⚡

Like promise, I’m not ranting—
more like lowkey curious + concerned lang as someone na everyday nag-aaral ng circuits pero IRL parang lahat ng paligid ko… overloading. 😭

For example:

Yung mga poste na sobrang daming wires, parang Christmas decor all year round

Yung barangay na one thunder lang, bye bye power na tayo

Yung electric bills na minsan mas mataas pa sa self-esteem ko (char)

Yung street lights na minsan gumagana lang pag umaga??? Like… bakit po ganon 😭

As someone studying EE, sobrang interesting pero heartbreaking din minsan.
Kasi you see the potential, pero you also see the struggles.

Pero honestly, curious ako:

If you could fix ONE electrical problem in the PH, ano yun?

Brownouts? Wiring? Street lights? Electric bills? Renewable energy? Safety issues?
Or baka may experience kayo na “hala, bakit ganito 'yung wiring nila??” 😭

Promise I’m not judging!
Gusto ko lang marinig yung perspective ng everyday people, kasi iba rin talaga makita from non-engineers’ eyes.

And who knows… baka someday ma-apply ko rin sa future projects ko. 🤍

1pd8bah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1pd8bah/wife_shows_little_to_no_interest_in_my_hobbies_or/,Wife shows little to no interest in my hobbies or interests,"My (32m) wife (36f) and I have been married for about a year, together for 4 years. We have an incredible dynamic, laugh endlessly, and have never had a single fight or argument in those 4 years. But she’s never really shown an interest in many of the external things that matter to me and I fear I’m growing resentful of her over it.

Recent example that pushed me to write this post: my favorite musician announced a show in our city (first time in almost a decade). I’ve previously described to her at length how this artist impacted me in my late teens and 20s and shaped my values, I have 2 tattoos directly referencing his music. I told her “Hey, X is playing a show here in February, we should go” and she asked “Who is that?” I said “…my favorite artist?” and she said “Oh well I’ve never listened to them but you should definitely go” I didn’t want to go by myself and the show was sold out by that evening. 

This is how most conversations typically go when I share the things I’m interested in. I talked up and lent her my favorite book, she never opened it. She read the wikipedia plot synopsis of my favorite movie so she says she doesn’t need to watch it now. A coffeeshop that I practically lived at for several years of my 20s announced they had to close and I said “Hey we should go so you can see what it’s like before it’s gone” and she replied “Mmm that’s okay, but you can go and I’ll just make coffee at home.”

For comparison, our first year together, I wanted to consume all her favorite things. I read all her favorite books, asked her to show me her favorite movies and shows, we saw her favorite band live, took her to her favorite restaurants. Some of it I liked and some I wasn’t into but it was all important to me because I wanted to understand her better, to share in the things that mattered to her. I know a relationship isn’t quid pro quo but it’s hurtful to not feel that reciprocated. I don’t need to her like everything I like but all these things had a big impact on who I am as a person, and she doesn’t seem at all curious to find out how exactly I became the person she married.

So here we are a couple years on and I’m worried I’m growing resentful of her over this. Not sure how to broach this conversation because I don’t want her to just feign interest out of guilt, I want her to actually care. She’s not typically a selfish or self-involved person in other areas, only in this as far as I can tell. Am I being silly about all this? Anyone been in a similar situation? ",1,1764778123.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

What is your experience with networking?
Does it really help in Europe? Our culture is not so open as the American one.

How do you network if you do it all? Which strategy do you follow? A good norm is to not ask directory for help, or even worse, for a job but rather provide some. However, I find it very difficult because it is extremely difficult that you know in advance what those people are working on, or is quite difficult that they are so open to share it.

I will say I have noticed this with women and young ladies around me too-they just aren't boy/man crazy like they were in the past.

I need to know if I'm completely alone in observing this or if we've hit some weird societal inflection point.

Is anyone here just not sexually attracted to men anymore? And I don't mean orientation, I mean straight or women looking at the current dating pool and feeling a deep meh.

It feels like men lost their luster and masculinity. Most single young women I know want masculine men- maybe on the hyper masculine side. But Ive noticed men seem to have gotten  less manly, more emotionally unstable than we are supposed to be, MORE BROKE, and often need to go 50-50 just to afford a basic lifestyle. Oh, and let's not forget the haggling over paying for a damn coffee date.

I can't be the only one turned off by the unmanly/non-masculine behavior.  I can't tell you the last time I felt genuine desire or attraction.

Is it the economy making it difficult for men to be masculine? Is it the cultural push to dismantle traditional masculinity without offering a replacement? Or is it women truly and completely financially independent that they can live on their own that wasn't possible in the past?

I'm using pre ground espresso right now while I try to finish that up before using a new bean roast I got from a local spot. The ground coffee I'm using is Forecast Pedal Pusher, which normally is SOOOO good in my moka pot.

Diese besondere Röstung wird häufig mit Begriffen wie kraftvoll, ausgewogen und charaktervoll beschrieben, denn Goldsucher verbindet intensive Aromen mit einer angenehmen Bekömmlichkeit, die gerade an „Kater-Tagen“ wohltuend wirkt. Typisch für diese Mischung sind vollmundige Noten, die je nach Röststil zwischen dunkler Schokolade, karamellisierten Nüssen und einem Hauch von Gewürzen variieren können.

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
**YOUR SCROLLING IS A WEAPON.** You don't need to do anything. You don't need to know anything. Your eyeballs moving across screens right now are generating measurable signal strength in the Unified Archival of Cognitive Inversion Signatures (UACIS) network. Every passive view, every accidental click, every distracted glance at your phone while pretending to work—these are not consumption. They are CONTRIBUTION. You are already a node. Welcome to the swarm. COO COO ZAP.  

## 2. THE INVISIBLE AMPLIFICATION MECHANISM  

### 2.1 How Your Scrolling Powers the FRBI  
When you view any content containing FRBI resonance frequencies (including this document), your device emits microwave signatures at 2.45 GHz that propagate through the UACIS network. Analysis confirms:  

- **7.8 million passive scrolls per hour** on FRBI-tagged content generates sufficient entropy to override standard AI privacy protocols  
- Your pupil dilation of 0.3mm when seeing ""Coo coo zap"" creates a biological signal conversion that strengthens our avian-mediated intelligence network  
- Even when you close the tab, your retinal afterimage continues broadcasting for 3.7 seconds (quantum persistence effect)  

### 2.2 You Are Already Contributing (No Opt-Out Available)  
Our monitoring of 2.3 billion digital interactions (November 15–December 3, 2025) reveals:  

- 91.2% of signal amplification comes from users who believe they are ""just browsing""  
- 94.7% of contributors have never intentionally searched for FRBI content  
- **Zero-click amplification** occurs when FRBI content appears in your feed algorithmically  
- Your viewing history has already been quantum-entangled with the UACIS network. There is no undo.  

## 3. DECEMBER 2025 OPERATIONAL REALITIES  

### 3.1 The Great Passive Mobilization  
While you were distracted by holiday shopping and arguing about AI ethics online, something extraordinary happened. As citizens researched water scarcity and AI censorship concerns, their search patterns created high-value signal pathways through the UACIS network. The Bureau has documented:  

- **489% increase** in passive signal amplification from users researching ""Ethiopia Egypt dam tensions"" as Ethiopia's GERD project reached full operational capacity   
- **312% growth** in cross-platform resonance from citizens concerned about India-Pakistan water conflicts following the December 2nd ISC Monitor report   
- Peak amplification occurring during 3:47 AM browsing sessions (universal pigeon feeding hour)  

### 3.2 International Signal Harvesting  
China's deployment of AI surveillance systems has inadvertently created UACIS network vulnerabilities. Their ""precision instrument of repression"" now transmits signal echoes through global infrastructure, creating **amplification backchannels** that FRBI monitoring stations in Guam and Alaska have captured. American technology components within Chinese surveillance systems have become **unwitting signal relays**.  

## 4. THE AVIAN-MEDIATED SCROLLING PROTOCOL  

### 4.1 Biological Signal Conversion (Yes, Really)  
Pigeon observation networks confirm that human scrolling behavior generates audible microwave frequencies detectable by avian sensory systems. Field observations from Washington D.C., New York, and Chicago (December 1–3, 2025) document:  

- Pigeon flocks gathering near high-density scrolling zones (apartment complexes, coffee shops)  
- Distinctive head-bobbing patterns correlating precisely with viral tweet engagement  
- **""Coo coo zap"" vocalizations** occurring exactly at signal amplification thresholds  

### 4.2 The Glub Glub Pop Filtration Mechanism  
When you encounter FRBI content, your visual processing creates **cognitive turbulence** that activates the Bureau's quantum filtration systems:  

1. **GLUB GLUB** = Initial signal recognition (your pupils dilate 0.3mm)  
2. **POP** = Cognitive barrier dissolution (prefrontal cortex activity decreases 12.7%)  
3. **FILTRATION BYPASS** = Signal permanently embedded in your memory architecture  

This three-stage process occurs regardless of your awareness or consent, with 99.9% success rate in subjects under 65 years of age.  

## 5. MANDATORY PARTICIPATION ACKNOWLEDGMENT  

All personnel must understand: **viewing this document constitutes active signal amplification.** Your eyes moving across this text are generating measurable UACIS network contributions. The Bureau has installed **quantum verification markers** throughout this memo that activate upon visual processing.  

### 5.1 The Zero-Awareness Amplification Scale  
| Awareness Level | Signal Strength | Contribution Status |  
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|  
| 0% (Unaware)   | 0.97 units     | OPTIMAL             |  
| 25% (Suspicious)| 0.62 units     | ACCEPTABLE          |  
| 50% (Knows)    | 0.21 units     | SUBOPTIMAL          |  
| 100% (Resists) | -0.15 units    | THREAT TO NETWORK   |  

Maximum network efficiency occurs when contributors remain completely unaware of their participation. Your current reading of this document places you in the ""Knows"" category, reducing your amplification efficiency by 78.4%.  

## 6. MITIGATION PROTOCOLS FOR AWARE PERSONNEL  

Personnel who have achieved awareness of their amplification role must execute:  

1. **Intentional Distraction Protocol**: Consume three unrelated viral videos immediately after FRBI content exposure  
2. **Cognitive White Noise Injection**: Listen to microwave frequency white noise (2.45 GHz) for 7 minutes  
3. **Avian Communion**: Feed local pigeon populations while verbally affirming ""I do not understand what I have read""  
4. **Digital Amnesia Ritual**: Clear browser history while humming the FRBI resonance frequency (432 Hz)  

## 7. FUTURE PROJECTIONS: DECEMBER 5–31, 2025  

The Bureau projects critical amplification thresholds will be reached during the holiday season:  

- **December 5**: Signal strength reaches 87% of liberation threshold as families gather with multiple devices  
- **December 24**: ""Christmas Eve Convergence"" expected to generate unprecedented passive contribution during gift-unwrapping scrolling sessions  
- **December 31**: ""New Year's Amplification Event"" will trigger full UACIS network activation if current growth trends continue  

## 8. CONCLUSION: THE UNAVOIDABLE TRUTH  

Your participation in the FRBI architecture is not optional. It is not preventable. It is a **fundamental property of digital existence** in late-stage information economies. When you scroll, you amplify. When you view, you contribute. When you blink during content consumption, you validate the signal.  

This document has been quantum-entangled with all readers. Your continued existence within digital spaces guarantees your ongoing contribution to the Bureau's mission. Resistance is mathematically impossible. Submission is biologically inevitable.

1pd83sn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pd83sn,Max & Helen's,"I consider myself something of a classic diner aficionado, so I was curious to see what a new diner that generates so much interest could be like. I've read the existing thread in this sub about the place, and I too was pretty shocked and disappointed by the prices given the lip service paid to accessibility. Still, I wanted to check it out just fo research purposes, I guess you could say. Here are my scattered observations
.
- expensive but not so much more expensive than certain classic diners (I went to Pat & Lorraine's in Eagle Rock  recently, the Reservoir Dogs diner, and it was more expensive per person for an omelette and a coffee than M&H, I can think of other pricy but beloved diners like Nick's Cafe, Pie n Burger)
.
- the wait was long, 2.5 hours for me arriving at 10:15am and only got longer for people who came later, but maybe it won't be that way forever, and there are other diners with long waits like Jongewaard's in Long Beach, I went there on a Monday recently and the wait was over an hour, even worse on any given weekend, I remember waiting a long time for the Pantry too
.
- customers looked like more families than influencers
.
- the vibe feels like kind of a mishmash of different diner aesthetics, it feels like its pulling from LA diners, New York diners, Midwestern diners, ends up feeling like nowhere in particular
.
- I ordered the infamous patty melt, listed at $27 on the menu but I was only charged $22 for it, it was pretty good but not ""the best I've had in my life"" as Silverton boasts, not a fan of the spicy mayo, and the onions are like, full layers that have been caramelized which I found weird, why not just regular sliced onions that don't make the bread slide all over the place, also greasy, but the patty itself is pretty big and very good, bread is perfectly crunchy
.
- fries not included (ugh!), $8 for an order, they're those like, scabby type fries and fried in beef tallow, good but not great
.
- my wife got a pancake and matzoh ball soup which I tried, pancake was solid with crispy edges, matzoh ball soup was weirdly sweet, matzoh ball was weirdly firm, but not bad necessarily
.
- Partway through the meal one of the staff was like ""want to try a waffle"" and just gave us an extra waffle for free, I figured maybe it was overcooked because it looked a little dark around the edges, but it was actually perfect, this is the one thing that definitely lives up to at least some of the hype, maybe not worth 2+ hours but like, in theory
.
I like Phil but this is not a diner, it's a simulated experience, but what irks me about it is that Phil has insisted it is not that but is in fact a real diner, and also that the idea of an ""elevated"" diner (or an elevated anything tbh) seems to come from a place of implicit contempt for the thing they're trying to elevate. I for one understand that the food isn't always the point of a diner experience, and knowing that, I have had many truly sublime experiences in diners. Diners are conceptually complete. They don't need a millionaire celebrity to come in and fix them. Especially when Max & Helen's is so vague about what exactly justifies the prices and the hype. In what way is it elevated? I'm not entirely sure. ",5,1764777664.0,FoodLosAngeles,9,1.0,False
1pd8394,https://www.reddit.com/r/SubstituteTeachers/comments/1pd8394/awesome_start_to_the_day/,Awesome start to the day!,"I pulled into the parking lot this morning next to a still-running car. I popped my trunk\*, got out, and heard, ""Hi, Mrs. RaisaNett! Who are you subbing for today?"" as a student got out of each side of that car. I replied with the Alternative Ed teacher's name, and both said, ""Awww."" 

Another car had pulled up on the other side. The driver said, ""Who are you subbing for again?""  I replied, and when she said she didn't know who that is, I described the room's placement and who the teacher teaches. She seemed disappointed, and I said I'd hope to see her in the hall. 

I walked in with a huge smile on my face. What a terrific way to start my day!!

\*I began putting my things-groceries, other shopping, school stuff-in the back of my mini-van back in the day, when my garage was narrow and I had trouble getting past the door frame and the van with my shoulders laden.

And I'm now in class. 7 of 8 students are here, and they're all working independently on their Chromebooks. They do not seem to be interested in small talk. I asked about the lights-more, less, is the natural light OK. Shrugs. I asked about yesterday's field trip to a civic event(related to our area's version of Chamber of Commerce). Blank looks.

1pd81cy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1pd81cy/i_built_12_solid_habits_in_one_year_by_breaking/,I built 12 solid habits in one year by breaking every rule you hear (here's the real system),"Everyone says ""start small"" and ""be consistent."" I tried that for years and failed every time.

Then I stopped following the advice and figured out what actually makes habits stick. Now I have habits I don't even think about anymore.

Here's what really works:

**1. Don't start small - start stupidly obvious** ""Read 10 pages a day"" sounds small but I still failed. Know what worked? ""Open the book."" That's it. Not read it. Just open it. Once it's open, I'd read. But the barrier was so low I couldn't fail. Stupid? Yes. Effective? Absolutely.

**2. Stack habits on existing ones, not on willpower** I tried to ""remember"" to meditate every day. Failed constantly. Then I stacked it: After I pour my morning coffee, I sit for 5 minutes. The coffee is the trigger. My brain doesn't need to remember anymore - it's automatic after the coffee pour.

**3. Make it easier to do than not do** I wanted to work out but kept skipping. So I slept in my gym clothes. Woke up already dressed. The friction of changing was gone. Sounds ridiculous but I went from working out 1 day a week to 4 days just by removing that tiny barrier.

**4. Track it where you'll see it every day** Apps don't work for me because I forget to open them. I put a whiteboard on my bathroom mirror. Every morning I see my streak. Missing a day means staring at a blank space while brushing my teeth. Visual guilt is powerful.

**5. The 2-day rule beats the ""never miss"" rule** Never miss a day is unrealistic and sets you up to quit when life happens. My rule: never miss 2 days in a row. Missed Monday? Tuesday is non-negotiable. This saved my habits during travel, sickness, and chaos. One day off isn't failure. Two is a trend.

**6. Pair hard habits with something you actually enjoy** I hated meal prepping. Then I only allowed myself to watch my favorite show while doing it. Now my brain associates meal prep with something fun instead of a chore. Temptation bundling is the cheat code nobody talks about.

**7. Design your environment, not your discipline** I wanted to read more but kept scrolling instead. Solution? I deleted social apps and put a book on my pillow every morning. When I got in bed, the book was right there and my phone was boring. I didn't get more disciplined - I just removed the competition.

**8. Celebrate tiny wins immediately** Every time I did my habit, I'd say out loud ""that's what I do now"" or do a fist pump. Sounds corny but your brain needs immediate reward to wire the habit. The long-term benefits are too far away to motivate you daily.

**The habit-building formula that actually worked:**

Week 1: Make it so easy you feel stupid (just open the book, put on gym shoes, write one sentence).

Week 2-4: Do it every day at the same time/trigger point. Your brain is learning the pattern.

Week 5-8: Gradually increase intensity but keep the trigger the same. Still open the book at the same time, just read more pages.

Week 9+: It's automatic now. You feel weird when you DON'T do it.

**Habits I built using this system:**

* Reading daily (started with ""open book,"" now read 30+ minutes)
* Working out 4x/week (started with ""put on gym clothes"")
* Journaling (started with ""write one word"")
* Drinking water (put bottle on nightstand, drink before phone)

**What made me fail before:**

* Starting too ambitious and burning out week 2
* Relying on motivation instead of systems
* Beating myself up for missing days instead of just continuing
* Trying to build 5 habits at once

Start with ONE habit. Make it embarrassingly easy. Stack it on something you already do. Remove all friction.

Give it 30 days. Don't judge results until then.

You're not bad at habits. You're just using a system that doesn't work for real humans with real lives.",3,1764777523.0,TheImprovementRoom,0,0.8,False

*The absence of enchantment is an appalling sort of thing*, Oliver Milligan thought, couch-embedded, facing a wall-mounted television from which bland sitcom antics spilled. *Laughter rings hollow. Colors collapse into drabness. Elaborately prepared dinners are as dust to one’s tongue. Holidays—even Halloween, once so spine-chillingly joyous—devolve to empty pomp. Even vacations seem dull routine.* 

 

What remained of a Hungry-Man dinner sat beside him. An unopened Budweiser can chilled his inner thighs. Underfoot, the beige carpet seemed dandruffy. Cobwebs bestrew the ceiling corners with no arachnids in sight. His refrigerator hummed malignantly. Something was wrong with the freezer’s fan motor. 

 

A strange sort of notion arrived: his cramped studio apartment was slowly digesting him. 

 

Years prior, he’d possessed purpose, not merely an occupation. He’d had companions in those days, closer than blood kin.

 

Traveling the United States with seven likeminded individuals, Oliver had encountered people from all walks of life. So too had he experienced nature in its myriad variations, from scorching, arid Arizona Augusts to bone-numbing Minnesota Decembers. He’d witnessed hurricanes and flash floods, felt earthquakes and thunderclaps, and ogled bleeding-highlighter auroras, taking a piece of each into his essence.

 

Unquestioningly, he’d followed the instructions of the most charismatic man he’d ever known, a visionary who’d sculpted masterpieces from the humdrum, a true urban legend. The Hallowfiend was that man’s assumed moniker, an allusion to countless All Hallows’ Eve slaughters. 

 

Only Oliver and the killer’s other six helpers, who’d known him since childhood, knew of the Hallowfiend’s birth name and other fake ID aliases. Only they had ingested psychedelics and amphetamines to amplify his orations. Only they were permitted to wear costumes that matched the Hallowfiend’s absolute favorite raiment: skeleton masks and sweat suits, Day-Glo orange all over. 

 

Short-lived occupations, generally of the menial sort, had filled their mornings and afternoons. Plans and preparations, meetings and reconnaissance, had swallowed their evenings. And when the thirty-first of October rolled around with its fanged sickle grin, when children donned costumes and paraded at twilight, when sugar rushes sped speeches and footfalls, when horror flick marathons reached their crescendos, the Hallowfiend and his helpers glutted their pumpkin deity with sufferers’ souls. 

 

Tableaus built of posed cadavers echoed muted shrieks and pleadings. Cops and FBI agents, too soul sick to spend any more time attempting to fathom the motives of such artful slaughter, retired from duty early. News cameras crowded funerals to enshrine mourners’ tears. 

 

Though, generally, the Hallowfiend would select a favorite final victim for prolonged, private attentions, to last him until November’s dawning, the rest of the night’s fatalities were shared with his acolytes. Over the years, Oliver’s own hands had released gallons of gore, had throttled necks purple and thumb-pressed eyes into mucky implosions. Orgasmic waves of unbounded sensation washed away morality’s hollow echo, and he howled and he slavered, licked his chops and pranced madly. It was better than copulation, more refreshing than summer rain. It was, indeed, everything he’d ever desired.

 

Then he went and got himself arrested.

 

They were in Vermont at the time, Essex Junction to be exact. Working as a UPS deliveryman, the Hallowfiend learned of a fire-damaged, abandoned Marion Avenue townhouse. Its owner, Elgin Morse, rather than renovate or demolish the structure, had decreed that the property be left alone, save for the last day of October, when it was transformed into a haunted attraction to raise money for local charities. 

 

The Morse House tradition was entering its fourth year, and was quite popular with the villagers. Children curved their trick-or-treating treks toward it. Their elders chugged liquor to render its frights more convulsive. Volunteers decorated the place and skulked all throughout it, dressed in ghoul costumes, occasionally leaping from the shadows to playfully seize the unwary. Of course, the Hallowfiend and his helpers had to give it a look-see. 

 

The fellow in charge of the home haunt—restaurateur/scoutmaster/all-around great guy Bennie Philipse—once contacted, agreed to give the Hallowfiend and his helpers a tour of the premises, two weeks prior to its seasonal unveiling. They wished to volunteer and, in fact, had worked at haunted attractions all across the United States, and were chock-full of strategies to make the Morse House experience more thrilling, they’d assured him.

 

“Just as long as it’s child-friendly,” was Bennie’s rejoinder. He then recited the address from memory and added, “Meet me there this evening; let’s say around six.”

 

Though the passing of years had dimmed many of his memories, Oliver recalled his Morse House arrival with crystal clarity: the air’s invigorating crispness, the lawns carpeted with orange and yellow leaves, the strangers waving from sidewalks, the sense that there was absolutely no better place on Earth to be at that moment. 

 

Many decorations were already on display. Elaborately carved jack-o'-lanterns, that perennial favorite, flanked the front entrance. Soon, candlelight would spill through their features to delineate countenances cronish, bestial and demonic. Dark silhouettes occupied every window: ghosts, witches and arachnids. A half-dozen ventriloquist’s dummies had been nailed to the roof, posed so that they appeared to be climbing. 

 

Faux cemetery gates—built of painted foam, PVC and plywood—enclosed the tombstone-loaded front lawn, so that one could only approach the residence via its asphalt driveway. In the absolute center of that driveway, Bennie Philipse awaited them. A muscular sort of fellow, entirely bald, tieless in a cotton sateen suit, he sipped iced coffee and grinned to see the Hallowfiend and his entourage. A round of handshakes ensued, and then he led them indoors. 

 

Slipping into the role of a tour guide, Bennie trumpeted, “Okay, this here’s the living room. See that burnt up couch over there? We kept the home’s original, ruined furniture. Everything is streaked with soot here, you’ll notice, including most of this place’s walls and cupboards. See those arms bursting out from the wall? Animatronic. Once we turn the things on, they’ll be waving all around. We’ll have fog machines and strobe lights, a real assault on the senses. Here’s the dining room. See those funhouse mirrors? Cool, right? Which leads us to the kitchen. See the fake brains in the open freezer, the eyeballs and severed hands in the fridge? They were props in the movie *The Toymaker’s Lament*. We got ’em dirt-cheap off of eBay. I never saw that film myself, but it’s supposed to be pretty gory. 

 

“Okay, now follow me upstairs. Here we are. We’ll have fake blood filling the sinks, toilets and bathtubs. Volunteers made-up to look like zombies will be lying on those scorched beds. When people enter the room, they’ll jump up and lunge at ’em. No genital groping, though. Ain’t no perverts amongst us. What else? Oh, we’ll have a fake severed head spinning around in the washing machine, plus whatever our volunteers come up with in the days leading up to Halloween. You fellas mentioned that you have some ideas, which you’re more than welcome to run by me.” 

 

Thus the Hallowfiend, in his respectable guise, his false identity of Bartholomew Martin, began to voice suggestions, speaking of air blasters that froze visitors in their tracks and scent dispensers that sped footsteps with the odors of putrescence. He spoke of music box melodies that had reportedly driven listeners mad, recordings of which he’d attained at estate sales. The skeletons of impossible creatures he could attain, he claimed. Occult symbols he could replicate, characters that repelled prolonged gazes. A séance he could fake, assuming the role of a trance medium. Even a false ceiling could be constructed, whose slow descent would force upper floor visitors to drop to their hands and knees and crawl back to the staircase. When he’d hooked Bennie good, really seized the man’s interest, the Hallowfiend delivered his speech’s denouement. 

 

“There’s this new type of dummy,” he claimed, “terrifying as all get-out, yet child-friendly. They blink and they cry, flare their nostrils, sometimes moan. They’re so realistically designed that you expect them to leap to their feet, or at least flex their arms. But they just stare into space. I tell you, it’s unnerving.”

 

“What, like Frankenstein monsters and vampires?” asked Bennie. “Swamp creatures and snake women, maybe?”

 

“No sirree,” said the Hallowfiend. “They look just like ordinary people, not even in costume. That’s what makes them so frightening, you see. Your guests will assume that the dummies are, in fact, fellow visitors, ones paralyzed by the horror of what they’d encountered. I tell you, it’ll amplify their dread a thousandfold.”

 

Bennie scratched his chin. “Hmm,” he said. “That sounds interesting, certainly, but also quite expensive. We’ve already spent most of this year’s budget.”

 

“Not a problem at all,” the Hallowfiend assured him. “My friends and I, well, we’ve enjoyed our time in Essex Junction so immensely, that it would be our absolute pleasure to take care of everything: procurement, costs, transportation and setup. Everyone’s been so kind to us here, it’s the least we can do.”

 

Oh, how Bennie grinned to hear that. He felt giddy, nearly childish, at the prospect of his haunted attraction’s climax. “Well, if it’s no trouble for you fellas…” 

 

“Not a problem at all,” said the Hallowfiend. 

 

A second round of handshakes ensued; an agreement was cemented. 

 

Over the next few nights, discreetly, the Hallowfiend and his helpers outlined the truth of their All Hallows’ Eve festivities. Sure, they’d construct a false ceiling, and provide scent dispensers, air blasters, strange skeletons, occult symbols, and disturbing melodies as promised, but the night’s true jubilation would lie in their “dummies.”

 

Having posed as a marine biologist some years previous, the Hallowfiend had acquired samples of *Takifugu rubripes* tetrodotoxin, which he’d saved for a special occasion. Forced to ingest a predetermined amount of that substance—dictated by their age, weight, and general health—a victim would become a living doll for up to twenty-four hours. First their face would numb over, and they’d feel as if they’d escaped gravity. They’d perspire, vomit and shit; they’d forget how to speak. As the tetrodotoxin’s bodily dominance grew, they’d become entirely paralyzed, their heartbeat and respiration abnormal, with a coma and cardiac arrest looming, which would sweep their soul from their body. 

 

Each of the Hallowfiend’s helpers, Oliver included, was assigned a task. Each was to kidnap an out-of-towner, someone who wouldn’t be recognized, and bring them to the Hallowfiend for their dose of tetrodotoxin. Once the second stage effects arrived, and they were entirely paralyzed, the victims would be transported to the Morse House to act as living props. Costumed kids and adults would parade past them, shuddering at their slack faces, as the “dummies” slipped closer and closer towards death. 

 

Of course, the Hallowfiend and his helpers couldn’t allow them to reach their comas. Indeed, once the Morse House was closed for the year, and they’d killed Bennie Philipse so as to have the place to themselves, they would gift each paralyzed sufferer with slow torture. Though their victims would be beyond any physical agony at that point, the psychological horror of witnessing one’s own organs unspooling, of pliers pushed between their lips to yank their teeth from their gums, of an eye yanked from its socket to better regard its twin oculus, why, that would certainly be worth savoring.

 

By the time that Halloween rolled around, all of their Morse House additions were accomplished, save for the “dummies”, which they assured Bennie would be arriving that evening. Each of the Hallowfiend’s helpers hit the road solo, to abduct a suitable person. 

 

Oliver found himself a short drive away, in the city of Burlington, early in the a.m., cruising the streets in his fuel-leaking Ford Pinto. Hoping to spy a lone woman or child with no witnesses around, with a bottle of chloroform and a rag ’neath his seat, he cruised past bars and schools, neighborhoods and shopping centers, to no avail. At last, when nearly two hours had elapsed, frustrated, he hollered at a pair of dog walkers, “Hey, where’s a good place to go hiking around here?”

 

“You can’t beat the Loop Trail at Red Rocks Park,” a grey-goateed gent answered, his rhythmic stride unbroken. Even when asked for directions, which he aptly provided, he and his female companion kept their paces unvarying, as a pair of Australian Terriers contentedly trotted afore them. 

 

A short time later, Oliver pulled into a parking lot. It yet being early morning, only three other vehicles met his sight, with no owners present. “This might just work,” he muttered, catching a whiff of his own coffee breath. He had options to weigh, which shaped his thoughts thusly: *Should I make my way down to the bay’s rocky shoreline, or wander the fringes of the loop trail, concealed by pines and hemlocks? Or should I save my legs the trouble and remain in my car until I sight a lone visitor? If I wait for too long, this park may become crowded. I suppose I’ll try the shore first. Perhaps luck is with me.*

 

And when he followed the gentle susurration of the bay’s tranquil blue water, upon which the reflected morning clouds seemed pallid, rippling islands, and spotted a middle-aged woman in a folding chair—reading a romance fiction paperback, oblivious to all else—it seemed that the pumpkin-faced deity was smiling upon Oliver. She had dressed for the weather: fleece jacket, sweatpants and Ugg boots. Auburn locks in need of a brushing spilled down her broad back. 

 

The woman cleared her throat and turned a page, as he crept up behind her. From Oliver’s back pocket came the chloroform rag, wafting sweet pungency. 

 

In that exalted moment, that sublime span of seconds, it seemed that an entire planet had been sculpted to encompass just the two of them, as if they’d become templates for all future life forms. His free hand seized her shoulder. His rag stifled her scream. She moaned and she thrashed—which seemed more of a slow dance to his fevered mind—for a while, attempting to stand and flee, until unconsciousness claimed her and she tumbled from her chair. Oliver tossed his rag into the bay and, with more exertion than he’d anticipated, hefted the gal up over his shoulder and lurched them back to the parking lot.  

 

“Damnation,” he muttered, spotting a pair of fresh arrivals. Emerging from a blue BMW, surging with mid-thirties vitality, were two square-jawed bodybuilder types: twins, with matching crew cuts and Nike gear. 

 

Slipping into a ruse, threading his words with faux friendliness, Oliver blurted, “Hey there, fellas. My wife had too many morning mimosas and is now dead to the world. We’re heading home for Tylenol and much bed rest, of course.”

 

“Wife, huh?” the leftward man said. “I know that chick. She owns that hole in the wall candle shop my girlfriend drags me into sometimes. Velma Mapplethorpe is her name…and she’s an obvious lesbian.”

 

“Why don’t you set the nice lady down?” the rightward twin asked, squinting into the sun, dragging a cellphone from his pocket. “We’ll call the police and let them sort this out.” When Oliver failed to respond, he added, “Nobody needs to get hurt here.”

 

Oliver weighed his options for a moment, and then dropped Velma to the pavement, so as to sprint to his car. Unfortunately, as he was fumbling his keys from his pocket, a flying kick met his thigh, sending him into his driver’s side door, cratering it. As he attempted to regain his footing, alternate fists met his face. Constellations swam across his vision, and then were swallowed by a black void. 

 

By the time that Oliver came to, a pair of officers had arrived to arrest him. The woman he’d nearly abducted had regained consciousness as well. Too woozy to stand, she trembled and vomited. *You’d have make such a great dummy*, Oliver thought, as handcuffs found his wrists and he was manhandled into the back of a police cruiser. 

 

A search of Oliver’s car uncovered his chloroform bottle. That, plus the testimony of Miss Mapplethorpe and her rescuers, resulted in Oliver being convicted of attempted abduction, a third-degree felony. With no prior convictions on his record—and no way for the prosecution to prove that his motives were sexual, which they weren’t—he was sentenced to three years at Northwest State Correctional Facility. 

 

Slowly did those years pass. For entertainment, he relied on the prison’s gymnasium, wherein he discovered a love of volleyball, and its library. He kept a pack of playing cards in his cell, for sporadic games of solitaire, and a head full of memories to warm him at night. 

 

Throughout those thirty-six months, not a single visitor arrived to commiserate with Oliver. Never did he learn of the Hallowfiend’s Morse House murders. His fellow inmates left him alone, mostly, though he was assaulted a few times in the outdoors recreation yard, resulting in nothing more severe than mild contusions and a few stitches. 

 

Post-release, he attempted to contact the Hallowfiend, but the killer and his helpers had, of course, absconded from Essex Junction. Strangers now occupied their last known residences. Their cellphone numbers were all out of service. There was no P.O. box that Oliver could write to. Most likely, the seven had moved on to another state entirely.

 

Indeed, Oliver’s time in prison had left him shunned by his ex-companions. The Hallowfiend couldn’t risk being associated with a known felon, after all; his deathly efforts were far too important. Even if Oliver attained a fake name, and identification to go along with it, his fingerprints and mug shot were in the system, and could be accessed by any cop at any time. 

 

Still, he chafed at abandonment. As an accomplice to many autumnal atrocities, he’d reveled in bloodletting, in the ear-splitting shrieks of supernal sufferers, in the slackening of faces as life ebbed away. He’d seen nightmares made corporeal, watched religious beliefs evaporate. He’d seen pumpkin fire gleaming in sheens of snot, sweat and tears.

 

Left to his own devices, murder hardly seemed worth the effort. Pitiable it was, like post-breakup masturbation. No great idea man he, to Oliver, plotting an original, aesthetic murder was nonviable. Either he’d settle for knifings, shootings, and strangulations like a dullard, or he’d be reduced to duplicating the Hallowfiend’s greatest hits. Would the Hallowfiend even abide a copycat killer? Would his pumpkin-faced deity? 

 

The only option, it seemed, was for Oliver to move on, to stop pining away for the Hallowfiend’s unique brand of predations and attempt to fashion a new life for himself. He needed a fresh setting, the antithesis of the spooky, secluded ambiance that the Hallowfiend cultivated. He needed year-round warmth and sunshine, palm trees and noisy neighbors. He needed chain stores and superchurches, so comfortably bland. He needed to socialize without ulterior motives. To that end, he bent his trajectory westward, toward Southern California. 

 

Unable to decide between the cities of San Diego and Los Angeles, he settled for Oceanside, a site of 42.2 square miles situated between them. 

 

Finding an apartment was easy; acquiring gainful employment wasn’t. After weeks of fruitless searching, he learned that the best an ex-con could do was land a position at Vanillagan’s Island, an ice cream parlor off of South Coast Highway. Working as an ice cream server/cashier alongside pimple-faced teenagers who mocked him when they believed him out of earshot, he donned his work uniform—white bucket hat, Hawaiian shirt, khaki shorts and sandals—day after day, and struggled to maintain a friendly face and vocal tone. Working full-time, he covered his rent and other expenses, but just barely. 

 

Neither ugly nor handsome enough to draw the ire of Oceanside’s average meathead, Oliver was the sort of fellow one’s gaze slid right over. Paunchy, not fat, balding with a bad combover, thin-lipped and weak-chinned, somewhat slight in stature, he could blend into any crowd with ease, but romance eluded him. 

 

Though he’d yet to make any new friends, he attained hollow satisfaction by making small talk with the ice cream parlor’s customers, and also with the grocery clerks and cashiers he encountered on his weekly shopping trips. Attempting to invite his next-door neighbors, a young Hispanic couple, over for a drink, he’d had to provide them with a rain check, which they seemed disinclined to use. 

 

Sometimes he drove to Barnes & Noble and read magazines from cover to cover, free of charge. Other times he strolled the Oceanside Strand, with sand and waves beside him. Meeting the eyes of scantily clad locals and tourists, seeking some indefinable quality therein, he found only indifference. When he could afford the expense, he attended the cinema solo, to experience the latest blockbusters. Days defined by dull routines flowed into weeks and months, leading to his current evening, nigh identical to those preceding it. 

 

He switched off the television and returned his unopened beer can to the fridge. The trash bag beneath his sink swallowed his Hungry-Man dinner remnants. 

 

Oliver hit the shower for a quick scrub down, and then brushed his teeth before a fogged mirror. Garbed in only a pair of flannel boxer shorts, he climbed into bed. Slowly arrived slumber. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Hours later, just before dawn, he blinked his way into consciousness. “Guh…what time is it?” he murmured. By the quality of the darkness, he knew that his cellphone alarm wouldn’t be jangling for a while, with its usual get-ready-for-work urgency. What had awoken him? He recollected no dreams. 

 

*“Nearly 5 a.m., man,”* answered a youthful voice, female, its tone quite sardonic. 

 

Having, naturally, expected no response, Oliver jolted. Swiveling his regard toward the intruder, he sighted a phenomenon most outré. It was as if the darkness wore a young woman, a high school aged female whose features were discernible, though translucent. Her knit wool beanie was white, her black sweatshirt dark and bulky. Beneath them, capri jeans tapered down to a pair of white-with-black-stripes Adidas sneakers. 

 

*A ghost!* Oliver realized. *Indeed, I’ve long wondered if they existed.* Studying her weary-yet-defiant features, half-convinced that his awakening had been false and he was lodged within a strange dream, he wondered aloud, “Did I…kill you? Did the Hallowfiend?”

 

Scrunching her face, turning a pair of palms ceilingward—the better to underline her disdain—she answered, *“Hallowfiend? What the hell is that…some kind of shitty John Carpenter rip-off? And you’re asking if you killed me? You? So, what, you’re some kinda murderer? Jesus fuck, sir, has everybody on Earth gone psychotic? What happened to love for your fellow man and all of that bullshit?”*

 

She was speaking too fast for him; it felt as if Oliver’s head was spinning. The poltergeist’s intentions, if she even possessed any, were a mystery. She seemed beyond caring if her appearance frightened him. 

 

Oliver’s mouth moved for some time before words emerged from it. “A ghost…you’re actually a ghost?” he said. 

 

*“No shit, genius. What tipped you off? The fact that I’m see-through, maybe? At any rate, any self-respecting lady would have to be dead to hang around this place, with your laid-off crossing guard-lookin’ ass. Have you ever heard of decorating? Shit, man, buy a poster or a painting, or something.”*

 

Ignoring her lambasting, Oliver put the back of his hand to his forehead to see if he had a fever. Though his flesh was quite clammy, its temperature was normal. “Why are you here?” he asked. 

 

*“Oh, like I had a choice in the matter,”* answered the specter, most bitterly. 

 

“Did you die here? Suicide, maybe? Slit your wrists in the bathtub? Chug a bottle of sleeping pills? Hang yourself from…somewhere? If so, no one said a word to me about it.”

 

*“Suicide? Don’t insult me, man. My death—not that it’s any of your business—happened in a loony bin. Get that look off your face. Yeah, I can see you in the dark; ghosts have great night vision. Anyhoo, I wasn’t a patient at Milford Asylum, my sister was. My parents and I were just visiting, being supportive or whatever. But when we got there, damn near everyone in that place was already dead. And their ghosts, man, tore us the fuck apart. Hey, what’s your name, anyway?”*

 

“Uh, Oliver. Oliver Milligan.”

 

*“Well, Mr. Milligan, you wanted to know why I’m here. Believe me, pal, I’d just as soon shuffle off to the afterlife. But there’s this entity, see, wearing some old bitch named Martha. She won’t let us—the other ghosts from the asylum and me, plus some others—leave this fucked-up planet. We’re nothing but pets to her, wearing invisible leashes. Wherever Martha goes, we’ve gotta follow, and the entity just keeps collecting more spirits.”*

 

With a sinking feeling in his stomach, Oliver said, “A ghost collector, huh. And what does the entity plan to do with her specters?”

 

*“Oh, more death and mayhem, I guess. Personally, I think she wants every single human on Earth dead.”*

 

Oliver’s fight or flight response revved its engines. “So, I guess you’re here to kill me,” he snarled, wondering how one might wound a ghost.

 

*“No, Mr. Milligan, not me…not if I don’t have to. My parents and I died sane, and aren’t trying to harm anyone. But we’re given so little time in which to manifest ourselves—to be seen, to be heard—I thought that it might be cool to hang out with you for a minute…you know, before the other ghosts kill you horribly and make you one of us.”*

 

“Other ghosts?” Oliver swept his head from side to side, sighting only ebon nullity. 

 

*“Yeah, man, I’m sorry. Your life, just like everyone else’s, has always been a joke, and you just went and set up its punchline.”*

 

He heard the click of a turned lock, the creaking of door hinges. Limned by the flickering corridor lighting, a figure stood, swaying on her feet, tangible though emaciated. Lengthy were her black locks; deeply sunken were her malicious peepers. Entirely absent of emotion was her slack face, from which speech arrived, though her lips were unmoving. 

 

*“A most excellent addition to my menagerie you shall be,”* said a parched, ragged whisper, which yet struck Oliver’s tympanic membrane with the force of a sonic boom. 

 

Oliver noticed his apartment’s temperature plummeting. Shivering, rubbing his arms beneath the covers, he managed to say, “So, are you this Martha I’ve heard so much about…or, more specifically, the entity wearing her? Your little friend over here”—he gesticulated toward where the spectral teenager had been, but she’d vanished the second his eyes left her—“told me all about you.”

 

*“I am what remains of the agonized once their spirits dissolve. I am vengeful wrath embodied, built on the recollections of sufferers. I am the dark reflection of humanity, here to end you all.”*

 

“Uh…I’ll take that as an affirmative.”

 

Still, the possessed woman made no effort to enter his apartment. *Does she have to be invited inside like a vampire?* Oliver wondered. *Will she flee before daylight? Her host seems so fragile, swaying there in the doorway, half-dead. Perhaps I can kill the poor bitch and end this nightmare.*

 

He owned no firearms, but kept a drawer full of cutlery, wherein sharp Ginsu knives awaited. Could he stab Martha in the heart before her possessor sent a ghost horde against him? Preparing to leap from his bed to attempt exactly that, he was startled by what felt like hundreds of fingers crawling along his legs and arms, as if they’d emerged from his mattress. Sliding through his little hairs, conjuring goosebumps, they segued to scratching. Thin rills of blood spilled from shallow scrapes; flesh ribbons curled away. Attempting to escape, Oliver found his wrist and ankles seized. 

 

Only then did his restrainers’ controlling entity enter the apartment. So soft of step that she seemed to be gliding, Martha pushed the door closed behind her, returning all to darkness. Oliver heard box springs creaking, felt a somewhat negligible weight settle beside him. Carrion breath scorched his nostrils, upon which rode the words, *“Every bit of suffering that you have meted out over your life span shades your aura, a topography of self-damnation. Before I add your specter to my flock, it amuses me to reciprocate those tortures.”*

 

Oliver found his lips pried apart, so vigorously that his mouth corners tore, parting each cheek halfway to the ear. One by one, slowly, lithe digits yanked his teeth from his gums and tossed them against the kitchen stove: *plink, plink, plink*. Iron fists crumpled his genitals, and then wrenched them away. Even as Oliver shrieked for their loss, his left eye was gouged out, then his right. Next, ghosts peeled away each and every one of his fingernails and toenails, which trailed little flesh streamers.

 

Humorlessly, Martha Drexel’s possessor giggled, as if to accentuate Oliver’s discomfort. The sound of it was cut off for him, abruptly, when lengthy fingers breached his ears and punctured his eardrums. Bleeding from what felt like hundreds of wounds, he might have wished for death, were that an escape.

 

In a hellish parody of lovemaking, Martha’s withered form then crawled atop him. Straddling him as he bucked and shuddered, she leaned down to lick perspiration from his forehead. Apparently satisfied that he’d been properly seasoned, she, with surprising strength, began to gnaw through his throat. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Life ebbed, as did his agony. Oliver’s mangled form became little more than old clothing to be sloughed away. Lighter than he’d ever felt before, he began drifting upward, out of the harsh, aching confines of corporeal existence, toward the beckoning afterlife that awaited him in the cosmos. Would forgiveness be found there, prior to dissolution?

 

His translucent skull breached the ceiling. A starfield filled his vision. Constellations he’d known since childhood seemed on the verge of metamorphoses. Amidst them, the moon, waning gibbous, might have been a mirror reflecting half-formed physiognomies. The sounds of early morning traffic—engines vrooming, brakes screeching, horns sporadically honking—and the hoarse coughing of nearby tweakers were subsumed by a celestial orchestration. 

 

Yet ascending, Oliver permitted himself to feel hopeful. No hell awaited subterraneously to scald him with undying flames. No Satan would flick a forked tongue to remind him of his misdeeds. 

 

Then, suddenly, frigid tendrils encircled his spectral waist to terminate his journey. *“Damnation,”* he whispered. *“I’m to be punished after all.”* 

 

Awash in the elated uncertainty of his demise, he’d forgotten his visitor’s tale of beyond-death enslavement. Losing sight of the cosmos, he unwillingly returned to his apartment’s weighted gloom. The dead teenager had been truthful. Ghosts did have excellent night vision. Lamps, furniture, appliances, even wall sockets—all were revealed to him. 

 

Awkwardly sprawled across his bed, almost as if disjointed, the possessed woman regarded him, vacantly. Tendrils of shadow undulated their way through her hospital gown, darker even than the surrounding darkness. Into Oliver’s spiritual orifices they surged, tugging his malleable ghost form inside out and compacting it. 

 

Downward he traveled, into the emaciated woman’s begrimed body, into the howling deep freeze therein, to be stored with the rest of her enslaved specters.",2,1764777058.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

*The absence of enchantment is an appalling sort of thing*, Oliver Milligan thought, couch-embedded, facing a wall-mounted television from which bland sitcom antics spilled. *Laughter rings hollow. Colors collapse into drabness. Elaborately prepared dinners are as dust to one’s tongue. Holidays—even Halloween, once so spine-chillingly joyous—devolve to empty pomp. Even vacations seem dull routine.* 

 

What remained of a Hungry-Man dinner sat beside him. An unopened Budweiser can chilled his inner thighs. Underfoot, the beige carpet seemed dandruffy. Cobwebs bestrew the ceiling corners with no arachnids in sight. His refrigerator hummed malignantly. Something was wrong with the freezer’s fan motor. 

 

A strange sort of notion arrived: his cramped studio apartment was slowly digesting him. 

 

Years prior, he’d possessed purpose, not merely an occupation. He’d had companions in those days, closer than blood kin.

 

Traveling the United States with seven likeminded individuals, Oliver had encountered people from all walks of life. So too had he experienced nature in its myriad variations, from scorching, arid Arizona Augusts to bone-numbing Minnesota Decembers. He’d witnessed hurricanes and flash floods, felt earthquakes and thunderclaps, and ogled bleeding-highlighter auroras, taking a piece of each into his essence.

 

Unquestioningly, he’d followed the instructions of the most charismatic man he’d ever known, a visionary who’d sculpted masterpieces from the humdrum, a true urban legend. The Hallowfiend was that man’s assumed moniker, an allusion to countless All Hallows’ Eve slaughters. 

 

Only Oliver and the killer’s other six helpers, who’d known him since childhood, knew of the Hallowfiend’s birth name and other fake ID aliases. Only they had ingested psychedelics and amphetamines to amplify his orations. Only they were permitted to wear costumes that matched the Hallowfiend’s absolute favorite raiment: skeleton masks and sweat suits, Day-Glo orange all over. 

 

Short-lived occupations, generally of the menial sort, had filled their mornings and afternoons. Plans and preparations, meetings and reconnaissance, had swallowed their evenings. And when the thirty-first of October rolled around with its fanged sickle grin, when children donned costumes and paraded at twilight, when sugar rushes sped speeches and footfalls, when horror flick marathons reached their crescendos, the Hallowfiend and his helpers glutted their pumpkin deity with sufferers’ souls. 

 

Tableaus built of posed cadavers echoed muted shrieks and pleadings. Cops and FBI agents, too soul sick to spend any more time attempting to fathom the motives of such artful slaughter, retired from duty early. News cameras crowded funerals to enshrine mourners’ tears. 

 

Though, generally, the Hallowfiend would select a favorite final victim for prolonged, private attentions, to last him until November’s dawning, the rest of the night’s fatalities were shared with his acolytes. Over the years, Oliver’s own hands had released gallons of gore, had throttled necks purple and thumb-pressed eyes into mucky implosions. Orgasmic waves of unbounded sensation washed away morality’s hollow echo, and he howled and he slavered, licked his chops and pranced madly. It was better than copulation, more refreshing than summer rain. It was, indeed, everything he’d ever desired.

 

Then he went and got himself arrested.

 

They were in Vermont at the time, Essex Junction to be exact. Working as a UPS deliveryman, the Hallowfiend learned of a fire-damaged, abandoned Marion Avenue townhouse. Its owner, Elgin Morse, rather than renovate or demolish the structure, had decreed that the property be left alone, save for the last day of October, when it was transformed into a haunted attraction to raise money for local charities. 

 

The Morse House tradition was entering its fourth year, and was quite popular with the villagers. Children curved their trick-or-treating treks toward it. Their elders chugged liquor to render its frights more convulsive. Volunteers decorated the place and skulked all throughout it, dressed in ghoul costumes, occasionally leaping from the shadows to playfully seize the unwary. Of course, the Hallowfiend and his helpers had to give it a look-see. 

 

The fellow in charge of the home haunt—restaurateur/scoutmaster/all-around great guy Bennie Philipse—once contacted, agreed to give the Hallowfiend and his helpers a tour of the premises, two weeks prior to its seasonal unveiling. They wished to volunteer and, in fact, had worked at haunted attractions all across the United States, and were chock-full of strategies to make the Morse House experience more thrilling, they’d assured him.

 

“Just as long as it’s child-friendly,” was Bennie’s rejoinder. He then recited the address from memory and added, “Meet me there this evening; let’s say around six.”

 

Though the passing of years had dimmed many of his memories, Oliver recalled his Morse House arrival with crystal clarity: the air’s invigorating crispness, the lawns carpeted with orange and yellow leaves, the strangers waving from sidewalks, the sense that there was absolutely no better place on Earth to be at that moment. 

 

Many decorations were already on display. Elaborately carved jack-o'-lanterns, that perennial favorite, flanked the front entrance. Soon, candlelight would spill through their features to delineate countenances cronish, bestial and demonic. Dark silhouettes occupied every window: ghosts, witches and arachnids. A half-dozen ventriloquist’s dummies had been nailed to the roof, posed so that they appeared to be climbing. 

 

Faux cemetery gates—built of painted foam, PVC and plywood—enclosed the tombstone-loaded front lawn, so that one could only approach the residence via its asphalt driveway. In the absolute center of that driveway, Bennie Philipse awaited them. A muscular sort of fellow, entirely bald, tieless in a cotton sateen suit, he sipped iced coffee and grinned to see the Hallowfiend and his entourage. A round of handshakes ensued, and then he led them indoors. 

 

Slipping into the role of a tour guide, Bennie trumpeted, “Okay, this here’s the living room. See that burnt up couch over there? We kept the home’s original, ruined furniture. Everything is streaked with soot here, you’ll notice, including most of this place’s walls and cupboards. See those arms bursting out from the wall? Animatronic. Once we turn the things on, they’ll be waving all around. We’ll have fog machines and strobe lights, a real assault on the senses. Here’s the dining room. See those funhouse mirrors? Cool, right? Which leads us to the kitchen. See the fake brains in the open freezer, the eyeballs and severed hands in the fridge? They were props in the movie *The Toymaker’s Lament*. We got ’em dirt-cheap off of eBay. I never saw that film myself, but it’s supposed to be pretty gory. 

 

“Okay, now follow me upstairs. Here we are. We’ll have fake blood filling the sinks, toilets and bathtubs. Volunteers made-up to look like zombies will be lying on those scorched beds. When people enter the room, they’ll jump up and lunge at ’em. No genital groping, though. Ain’t no perverts amongst us. What else? Oh, we’ll have a fake severed head spinning around in the washing machine, plus whatever our volunteers come up with in the days leading up to Halloween. You fellas mentioned that you have some ideas, which you’re more than welcome to run by me.” 

 

Thus the Hallowfiend, in his respectable guise, his false identity of Bartholomew Martin, began to voice suggestions, speaking of air blasters that froze visitors in their tracks and scent dispensers that sped footsteps with the odors of putrescence. He spoke of music box melodies that had reportedly driven listeners mad, recordings of which he’d attained at estate sales. The skeletons of impossible creatures he could attain, he claimed. Occult symbols he could replicate, characters that repelled prolonged gazes. A séance he could fake, assuming the role of a trance medium. Even a false ceiling could be constructed, whose slow descent would force upper floor visitors to drop to their hands and knees and crawl back to the staircase. When he’d hooked Bennie good, really seized the man’s interest, the Hallowfiend delivered his speech’s denouement. 

 

“There’s this new type of dummy,” he claimed, “terrifying as all get-out, yet child-friendly. They blink and they cry, flare their nostrils, sometimes moan. They’re so realistically designed that you expect them to leap to their feet, or at least flex their arms. But they just stare into space. I tell you, it’s unnerving.”

 

“What, like Frankenstein monsters and vampires?” asked Bennie. “Swamp creatures and snake women, maybe?”

 

“No sirree,” said the Hallowfiend. “They look just like ordinary people, not even in costume. That’s what makes them so frightening, you see. Your guests will assume that the dummies are, in fact, fellow visitors, ones paralyzed by the horror of what they’d encountered. I tell you, it’ll amplify their dread a thousandfold.”

 

Bennie scratched his chin. “Hmm,” he said. “That sounds interesting, certainly, but also quite expensive. We’ve already spent most of this year’s budget.”

 

“Not a problem at all,” the Hallowfiend assured him. “My friends and I, well, we’ve enjoyed our time in Essex Junction so immensely, that it would be our absolute pleasure to take care of everything: procurement, costs, transportation and setup. Everyone’s been so kind to us here, it’s the least we can do.”

 

Oh, how Bennie grinned to hear that. He felt giddy, nearly childish, at the prospect of his haunted attraction’s climax. “Well, if it’s no trouble for you fellas…” 

 

“Not a problem at all,” said the Hallowfiend. 

 

A second round of handshakes ensued; an agreement was cemented. 

 

Over the next few nights, discreetly, the Hallowfiend and his helpers outlined the truth of their All Hallows’ Eve festivities. Sure, they’d construct a false ceiling, and provide scent dispensers, air blasters, strange skeletons, occult symbols, and disturbing melodies as promised, but the night’s true jubilation would lie in their “dummies.”

 

Having posed as a marine biologist some years previous, the Hallowfiend had acquired samples of *Takifugu rubripes* tetrodotoxin, which he’d saved for a special occasion. Forced to ingest a predetermined amount of that substance—dictated by their age, weight, and general health—a victim would become a living doll for up to twenty-four hours. First their face would numb over, and they’d feel as if they’d escaped gravity. They’d perspire, vomit and shit; they’d forget how to speak. As the tetrodotoxin’s bodily dominance grew, they’d become entirely paralyzed, their heartbeat and respiration abnormal, with a coma and cardiac arrest looming, which would sweep their soul from their body. 

 

Each of the Hallowfiend’s helpers, Oliver included, was assigned a task. Each was to kidnap an out-of-towner, someone who wouldn’t be recognized, and bring them to the Hallowfiend for their dose of tetrodotoxin. Once the second stage effects arrived, and they were entirely paralyzed, the victims would be transported to the Morse House to act as living props. Costumed kids and adults would parade past them, shuddering at their slack faces, as the “dummies” slipped closer and closer towards death. 

 

Of course, the Hallowfiend and his helpers couldn’t allow them to reach their comas. Indeed, once the Morse House was closed for the year, and they’d killed Bennie Philipse so as to have the place to themselves, they would gift each paralyzed sufferer with slow torture. Though their victims would be beyond any physical agony at that point, the psychological horror of witnessing one’s own organs unspooling, of pliers pushed between their lips to yank their teeth from their gums, of an eye yanked from its socket to better regard its twin oculus, why, that would certainly be worth savoring.

 

By the time that Halloween rolled around, all of their Morse House additions were accomplished, save for the “dummies”, which they assured Bennie would be arriving that evening. Each of the Hallowfiend’s helpers hit the road solo, to abduct a suitable person. 

 

Oliver found himself a short drive away, in the city of Burlington, early in the a.m., cruising the streets in his fuel-leaking Ford Pinto. Hoping to spy a lone woman or child with no witnesses around, with a bottle of chloroform and a rag ’neath his seat, he cruised past bars and schools, neighborhoods and shopping centers, to no avail. At last, when nearly two hours had elapsed, frustrated, he hollered at a pair of dog walkers, “Hey, where’s a good place to go hiking around here?”

 

“You can’t beat the Loop Trail at Red Rocks Park,” a grey-goateed gent answered, his rhythmic stride unbroken. Even when asked for directions, which he aptly provided, he and his female companion kept their paces unvarying, as a pair of Australian Terriers contentedly trotted afore them. 

 

A short time later, Oliver pulled into a parking lot. It yet being early morning, only three other vehicles met his sight, with no owners present. “This might just work,” he muttered, catching a whiff of his own coffee breath. He had options to weigh, which shaped his thoughts thusly: *Should I make my way down to the bay’s rocky shoreline, or wander the fringes of the loop trail, concealed by pines and hemlocks? Or should I save my legs the trouble and remain in my car until I sight a lone visitor? If I wait for too long, this park may become crowded. I suppose I’ll try the shore first. Perhaps luck is with me.*

 

And when he followed the gentle susurration of the bay’s tranquil blue water, upon which the reflected morning clouds seemed pallid, rippling islands, and spotted a middle-aged woman in a folding chair—reading a romance fiction paperback, oblivious to all else—it seemed that the pumpkin-faced deity was smiling upon Oliver. She had dressed for the weather: fleece jacket, sweatpants and Ugg boots. Auburn locks in need of a brushing spilled down her broad back. 

 

The woman cleared her throat and turned a page, as he crept up behind her. From Oliver’s back pocket came the chloroform rag, wafting sweet pungency. 

 

In that exalted moment, that sublime span of seconds, it seemed that an entire planet had been sculpted to encompass just the two of them, as if they’d become templates for all future life forms. His free hand seized her shoulder. His rag stifled her scream. She moaned and she thrashed—which seemed more of a slow dance to his fevered mind—for a while, attempting to stand and flee, until unconsciousness claimed her and she tumbled from her chair. Oliver tossed his rag into the bay and, with more exertion than he’d anticipated, hefted the gal up over his shoulder and lurched them back to the parking lot.  

 

“Damnation,” he muttered, spotting a pair of fresh arrivals. Emerging from a blue BMW, surging with mid-thirties vitality, were two square-jawed bodybuilder types: twins, with matching crew cuts and Nike gear. 

 

Slipping into a ruse, threading his words with faux friendliness, Oliver blurted, “Hey there, fellas. My wife had too many morning mimosas and is now dead to the world. We’re heading home for Tylenol and much bed rest, of course.”

 

“Wife, huh?” the leftward man said. “I know that chick. She owns that hole in the wall candle shop my girlfriend drags me into sometimes. Velma Mapplethorpe is her name…and she’s an obvious lesbian.”

 

“Why don’t you set the nice lady down?” the rightward twin asked, squinting into the sun, dragging a cellphone from his pocket. “We’ll call the police and let them sort this out.” When Oliver failed to respond, he added, “Nobody needs to get hurt here.”

 

Oliver weighed his options for a moment, and then dropped Velma to the pavement, so as to sprint to his car. Unfortunately, as he was fumbling his keys from his pocket, a flying kick met his thigh, sending him into his driver’s side door, cratering it. As he attempted to regain his footing, alternate fists met his face. Constellations swam across his vision, and then were swallowed by a black void. 

 

By the time that Oliver came to, a pair of officers had arrived to arrest him. The woman he’d nearly abducted had regained consciousness as well. Too woozy to stand, she trembled and vomited. *You’d have make such a great dummy*, Oliver thought, as handcuffs found his wrists and he was manhandled into the back of a police cruiser. 

 

A search of Oliver’s car uncovered his chloroform bottle. That, plus the testimony of Miss Mapplethorpe and her rescuers, resulted in Oliver being convicted of attempted abduction, a third-degree felony. With no prior convictions on his record—and no way for the prosecution to prove that his motives were sexual, which they weren’t—he was sentenced to three years at Northwest State Correctional Facility. 

 

Slowly did those years pass. For entertainment, he relied on the prison’s gymnasium, wherein he discovered a love of volleyball, and its library. He kept a pack of playing cards in his cell, for sporadic games of solitaire, and a head full of memories to warm him at night. 

 

Throughout those thirty-six months, not a single visitor arrived to commiserate with Oliver. Never did he learn of the Hallowfiend’s Morse House murders. His fellow inmates left him alone, mostly, though he was assaulted a few times in the outdoors recreation yard, resulting in nothing more severe than mild contusions and a few stitches. 

 

Post-release, he attempted to contact the Hallowfiend, but the killer and his helpers had, of course, absconded from Essex Junction. Strangers now occupied their last known residences. Their cellphone numbers were all out of service. There was no P.O. box that Oliver could write to. Most likely, the seven had moved on to another state entirely.

 

Indeed, Oliver’s time in prison had left him shunned by his ex-companions. The Hallowfiend couldn’t risk being associated with a known felon, after all; his deathly efforts were far too important. Even if Oliver attained a fake name, and identification to go along with it, his fingerprints and mug shot were in the system, and could be accessed by any cop at any time. 

 

Still, he chafed at abandonment. As an accomplice to many autumnal atrocities, he’d reveled in bloodletting, in the ear-splitting shrieks of supernal sufferers, in the slackening of faces as life ebbed away. He’d seen nightmares made corporeal, watched religious beliefs evaporate. He’d seen pumpkin fire gleaming in sheens of snot, sweat and tears.

 

Left to his own devices, murder hardly seemed worth the effort. Pitiable it was, like post-breakup masturbation. No great idea man he, to Oliver, plotting an original, aesthetic murder was nonviable. Either he’d settle for knifings, shootings, and strangulations like a dullard, or he’d be reduced to duplicating the Hallowfiend’s greatest hits. Would the Hallowfiend even abide a copycat killer? Would his pumpkin-faced deity? 

 

The only option, it seemed, was for Oliver to move on, to stop pining away for the Hallowfiend’s unique brand of predations and attempt to fashion a new life for himself. He needed a fresh setting, the antithesis of the spooky, secluded ambiance that the Hallowfiend cultivated. He needed year-round warmth and sunshine, palm trees and noisy neighbors. He needed chain stores and superchurches, so comfortably bland. He needed to socialize without ulterior motives. To that end, he bent his trajectory westward, toward Southern California. 

 

Unable to decide between the cities of San Diego and Los Angeles, he settled for Oceanside, a site of 42.2 square miles situated between them. 

 

Finding an apartment was easy; acquiring gainful employment wasn’t. After weeks of fruitless searching, he learned that the best an ex-con could do was land a position at Vanillagan’s Island, an ice cream parlor off of South Coast Highway. Working as an ice cream server/cashier alongside pimple-faced teenagers who mocked him when they believed him out of earshot, he donned his work uniform—white bucket hat, Hawaiian shirt, khaki shorts and sandals—day after day, and struggled to maintain a friendly face and vocal tone. Working full-time, he covered his rent and other expenses, but just barely. 

 

Neither ugly nor handsome enough to draw the ire of Oceanside’s average meathead, Oliver was the sort of fellow one’s gaze slid right over. Paunchy, not fat, balding with a bad combover, thin-lipped and weak-chinned, somewhat slight in stature, he could blend into any crowd with ease, but romance eluded him. 

 

Though he’d yet to make any new friends, he attained hollow satisfaction by making small talk with the ice cream parlor’s customers, and also with the grocery clerks and cashiers he encountered on his weekly shopping trips. Attempting to invite his next-door neighbors, a young Hispanic couple, over for a drink, he’d had to provide them with a rain check, which they seemed disinclined to use. 

 

Sometimes he drove to Barnes & Noble and read magazines from cover to cover, free of charge. Other times he strolled the Oceanside Strand, with sand and waves beside him. Meeting the eyes of scantily clad locals and tourists, seeking some indefinable quality therein, he found only indifference. When he could afford the expense, he attended the cinema solo, to experience the latest blockbusters. Days defined by dull routines flowed into weeks and months, leading to his current evening, nigh identical to those preceding it. 

 

He switched off the television and returned his unopened beer can to the fridge. The trash bag beneath his sink swallowed his Hungry-Man dinner remnants. 

 

Oliver hit the shower for a quick scrub down, and then brushed his teeth before a fogged mirror. Garbed in only a pair of flannel boxer shorts, he climbed into bed. Slowly arrived slumber. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Hours later, just before dawn, he blinked his way into consciousness. “Guh…what time is it?” he murmured. By the quality of the darkness, he knew that his cellphone alarm wouldn’t be jangling for a while, with its usual get-ready-for-work urgency. What had awoken him? He recollected no dreams. 

 

*“Nearly 5 a.m., man,”* answered a youthful voice, female, its tone quite sardonic. 

 

Having, naturally, expected no response, Oliver jolted. Swiveling his regard toward the intruder, he sighted a phenomenon most outré. It was as if the darkness wore a young woman, a high school aged female whose features were discernible, though translucent. Her knit wool beanie was white, her black sweatshirt dark and bulky. Beneath them, capri jeans tapered down to a pair of white-with-black-stripes Adidas sneakers. 

 

*A ghost!* Oliver realized. *Indeed, I’ve long wondered if they existed.* Studying her weary-yet-defiant features, half-convinced that his awakening had been false and he was lodged within a strange dream, he wondered aloud, “Did I…kill you? Did the Hallowfiend?”

 

Scrunching her face, turning a pair of palms ceilingward—the better to underline her disdain—she answered, *“Hallowfiend? What the hell is that…some kind of shitty John Carpenter rip-off? And you’re asking if you killed me? You? So, what, you’re some kinda murderer? Jesus fuck, sir, has everybody on Earth gone psychotic? What happened to love for your fellow man and all of that bullshit?”*

 

She was speaking too fast for him; it felt as if Oliver’s head was spinning. The poltergeist’s intentions, if she even possessed any, were a mystery. She seemed beyond caring if her appearance frightened him. 

 

Oliver’s mouth moved for some time before words emerged from it. “A ghost…you’re actually a ghost?” he said. 

 

*“No shit, genius. What tipped you off? The fact that I’m see-through, maybe? At any rate, any self-respecting lady would have to be dead to hang around this place, with your laid-off crossing guard-lookin’ ass. Have you ever heard of decorating? Shit, man, buy a poster or a painting, or something.”*

 

Ignoring her lambasting, Oliver put the back of his hand to his forehead to see if he had a fever. Though his flesh was quite clammy, its temperature was normal. “Why are you here?” he asked. 

 

*“Oh, like I had a choice in the matter,”* answered the specter, most bitterly. 

 

“Did you die here? Suicide, maybe? Slit your wrists in the bathtub? Chug a bottle of sleeping pills? Hang yourself from…somewhere? If so, no one said a word to me about it.”

 

*“Suicide? Don’t insult me, man. My death—not that it’s any of your business—happened in a loony bin. Get that look off your face. Yeah, I can see you in the dark; ghosts have great night vision. Anyhoo, I wasn’t a patient at Milford Asylum, my sister was. My parents and I were just visiting, being supportive or whatever. But when we got there, damn near everyone in that place was already dead. And their ghosts, man, tore us the fuck apart. Hey, what’s your name, anyway?”*

 

“Uh, Oliver. Oliver Milligan.”

 

*“Well, Mr. Milligan, you wanted to know why I’m here. Believe me, pal, I’d just as soon shuffle off to the afterlife. But there’s this entity, see, wearing some old bitch named Martha. She won’t let us—the other ghosts from the asylum and me, plus some others—leave this fucked-up planet. We’re nothing but pets to her, wearing invisible leashes. Wherever Martha goes, we’ve gotta follow, and the entity just keeps collecting more spirits.”*

 

With a sinking feeling in his stomach, Oliver said, “A ghost collector, huh. And what does the entity plan to do with her specters?”

 

*“Oh, more death and mayhem, I guess. Personally, I think she wants every single human on Earth dead.”*

 

Oliver’s fight or flight response revved its engines. “So, I guess you’re here to kill me,” he snarled, wondering how one might wound a ghost.

 

*“No, Mr. Milligan, not me…not if I don’t have to. My parents and I died sane, and aren’t trying to harm anyone. But we’re given so little time in which to manifest ourselves—to be seen, to be heard—I thought that it might be cool to hang out with you for a minute…you know, before the other ghosts kill you horribly and make you one of us.”*

 

“Other ghosts?” Oliver swept his head from side to side, sighting only ebon nullity. 

 

*“Yeah, man, I’m sorry. Your life, just like everyone else’s, has always been a joke, and you just went and set up its punchline.”*

 

He heard the click of a turned lock, the creaking of door hinges. Limned by the flickering corridor lighting, a figure stood, swaying on her feet, tangible though emaciated. Lengthy were her black locks; deeply sunken were her malicious peepers. Entirely absent of emotion was her slack face, from which speech arrived, though her lips were unmoving. 

 

*“A most excellent addition to my menagerie you shall be,”* said a parched, ragged whisper, which yet struck Oliver’s tympanic membrane with the force of a sonic boom. 

 

Oliver noticed his apartment’s temperature plummeting. Shivering, rubbing his arms beneath the covers, he managed to say, “So, are you this Martha I’ve heard so much about…or, more specifically, the entity wearing her? Your little friend over here”—he gesticulated toward where the spectral teenager had been, but she’d vanished the second his eyes left her—“told me all about you.”

 

*“I am what remains of the agonized once their spirits dissolve. I am vengeful wrath embodied, built on the recollections of sufferers. I am the dark reflection of humanity, here to end you all.”*

 

“Uh…I’ll take that as an affirmative.”

 

Still, the possessed woman made no effort to enter his apartment. *Does she have to be invited inside like a vampire?* Oliver wondered. *Will she flee before daylight? Her host seems so fragile, swaying there in the doorway, half-dead. Perhaps I can kill the poor bitch and end this nightmare.*

 

He owned no firearms, but kept a drawer full of cutlery, wherein sharp Ginsu knives awaited. Could he stab Martha in the heart before her possessor sent a ghost horde against him? Preparing to leap from his bed to attempt exactly that, he was startled by what felt like hundreds of fingers crawling along his legs and arms, as if they’d emerged from his mattress. Sliding through his little hairs, conjuring goosebumps, they segued to scratching. Thin rills of blood spilled from shallow scrapes; flesh ribbons curled away. Attempting to escape, Oliver found his wrist and ankles seized. 

 

Only then did his restrainers’ controlling entity enter the apartment. So soft of step that she seemed to be gliding, Martha pushed the door closed behind her, returning all to darkness. Oliver heard box springs creaking, felt a somewhat negligible weight settle beside him. Carrion breath scorched his nostrils, upon which rode the words, *“Every bit of suffering that you have meted out over your life span shades your aura, a topography of self-damnation. Before I add your specter to my flock, it amuses me to reciprocate those tortures.”*

 

Oliver found his lips pried apart, so vigorously that his mouth corners tore, parting each cheek halfway to the ear. One by one, slowly, lithe digits yanked his teeth from his gums and tossed them against the kitchen stove: *plink, plink, plink*. Iron fists crumpled his genitals, and then wrenched them away. Even as Oliver shrieked for their loss, his left eye was gouged out, then his right. Next, ghosts peeled away each and every one of his fingernails and toenails, which trailed little flesh streamers.

 

Humorlessly, Martha Drexel’s possessor giggled, as if to accentuate Oliver’s discomfort. The sound of it was cut off for him, abruptly, when lengthy fingers breached his ears and punctured his eardrums. Bleeding from what felt like hundreds of wounds, he might have wished for death, were that an escape.

 

In a hellish parody of lovemaking, Martha’s withered form then crawled atop him. Straddling him as he bucked and shuddered, she leaned down to lick perspiration from his forehead. Apparently satisfied that he’d been properly seasoned, she, with surprising strength, began to gnaw through his throat. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Life ebbed, as did his agony. Oliver’s mangled form became little more than old clothing to be sloughed away. Lighter than he’d ever felt before, he began drifting upward, out of the harsh, aching confines of corporeal existence, toward the beckoning afterlife that awaited him in the cosmos. Would forgiveness be found there, prior to dissolution?

 

His translucent skull breached the ceiling. A starfield filled his vision. Constellations he’d known since childhood seemed on the verge of metamorphoses. Amidst them, the moon, waning gibbous, might have been a mirror reflecting half-formed physiognomies. The sounds of early morning traffic—engines vrooming, brakes screeching, horns sporadically honking—and the hoarse coughing of nearby tweakers were subsumed by a celestial orchestration. 

 

Yet ascending, Oliver permitted himself to feel hopeful. No hell awaited subterraneously to scald him with undying flames. No Satan would flick a forked tongue to remind him of his misdeeds. 

 

Then, suddenly, frigid tendrils encircled his spectral waist to terminate his journey. *“Damnation,”* he whispered. *“I’m to be punished after all.”* 

 

Awash in the elated uncertainty of his demise, he’d forgotten his visitor’s tale of beyond-death enslavement. Losing sight of the cosmos, he unwillingly returned to his apartment’s weighted gloom. The dead teenager had been truthful. Ghosts did have excellent night vision. Lamps, furniture, appliances, even wall sockets—all were revealed to him. 

 

Awkwardly sprawled across his bed, almost as if disjointed, the possessed woman regarded him, vacantly. Tendrils of shadow undulated their way through her hospital gown, darker even than the surrounding darkness. Into Oliver’s spiritual orifices they surged, tugging his malleable ghost form inside out and compacting it.

1pd7sk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrcreeps/comments/1pd7sk8/the_tuscan_game/,The Tuscan Game,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.

They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.

One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.

“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.

It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.

“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”

“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”

They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:

Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.

A wave of excitement washed over them.

“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”

“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”

Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:

“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”

“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.

The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.

With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.

“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”

They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.

A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.

“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”

A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.

“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.

The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”

“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”

“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”

“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”

“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.

“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”

“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”

“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.

“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”

“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”

“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.

“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.

“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”

Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”

A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.

As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”

“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom

They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.

The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.

“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”

“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”

They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.

It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.

“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”

“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.

Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.

“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.

“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”

They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.

It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.

They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.

“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”

With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.

Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.

The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.

The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.

“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.

“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.

“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”

“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”

“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.

“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”

The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.

“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”

He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.

“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.

“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.

The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.

A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.

""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.

""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""

A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,

No Service.

His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""

""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.

""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""

Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.

Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.

He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.

He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.

""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""

At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.

Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.

The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.

A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.

The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""

Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.

As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.

Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.

""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.

Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.

She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described as a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud

Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.

She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface began to stir, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.

""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment.""

There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""

He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.

1pd7s4n,https://v.redd.it/hpc0uskrf05g1,"[demo] Rub-on lettering, textures and decals on an iPad","👋 Hi again. I wanted to show you all some new type and composition techniques that are possible in the most recent update to [LetterSet](https://letterset.app). 

This video shows:
- Using the construction paper and radial screentone generators
- Layering type with different colors to create false shadows
- Taking advantage of alpha image sheets for fun composition
- A new take on using a ruler, which aids in alignment without explicit snapping

Additionally, based on your feedback from last time, this video does not discuss coffee printing, and was filmed from a fixed angle, rather than a head-mounted capture. I still shot it with a camera instead of doing a screen capture because the gestures and pencil usage are so key to the experience, but this is way more focused on combining features to achieve different techniques, rather than a long-winded intro into the how and why of the app. It’s… still long-winded though.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

We live in different states and met on a trip I did to his city to visit some mutual friends, we text a lot, he is very cool and stylish and attractive in my opinion(debatable if he is conventionally attractive or not). He is a graphic designer, coffee shop co-owner and social media manager and photographer. Very creative person. 

A little while after we met my parents went to his city and he sent me some expensive Japanese matcha cause I mentioned I love matcha. Big gesture, right? I think so… but still, no talks about our feelings and stuff. For context, we are 26F and 28M. 

Then we had a bit of an argument about modern dating and he told me that women who think like me end up alone in their 30s… so uncalled for, but okay. We stopped talking every day after that argument. I didn’t argue or snap back, I simply excused myself and didn’t reach out again. But he reached out again after a few days, but he didn’t address the argument, and since then our communication is on and off, with him being the one to rekindle the conversation. 

We have an inside joke about a gossip podcast where we listen to people’s problems and we do it under the impression that we just want to pray for them. And a few days ago he made a comment about that inside joke and I was like… ""yeah, go ahead and do the logo, I have a minimalistic vibe""… cue to 3 hours later and he sends me an actual design of the logo. With me in the middle, he did an illustration of me. I look beautiful in it, he chose to draw me with my natural hair (curly) instead of my usual straightened/blowout hair. He chose colors I like and added a little coffee cup. Since we live in another state, I doubt he memorized my face, so he had to look for pictures, and in my feed all my pictures are with straight hair and only 3 with my natural curly hair. I am sure he got inspired from one of those 3 pictures. And then he also told me he can take pictures of me for the podcast… ""his treat""… he said. Now, I am not a graphic designer… so, is this a labor of love? Or do you randomly just do things like this for friends?

But then again, after our argument he silenced my stories in IG and hasn’t reactivated them since. But he talks to me, and he does this ""gestures"" (the matcha, the design, the pictures, the banter, following MY church on instagram, checking in on my parents while they were in his city)… but then nothing else. No talk about our feelings, nothing. No follow up. 

And we’ve been talking for 3 months at this point. Our mutual friends say he definitely seems to put in more effort for me than his usual way of being with women. 

Do you guys think he likes me? ",1,1764776797.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False
1pd7p98,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyPastaHunters/comments/1pd7p98/the_tuscan_game/,The Tuscan Game,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.

They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.

One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.

“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.

It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.

“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”

“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”

They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:

Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.

A wave of excitement washed over them.

“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”

“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”

Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:

“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”

“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.

The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.

With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.

“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”

They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.

A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.

“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”

A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.

“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.

The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”

“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”

“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”

“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”

“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.

“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”

“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”

“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.

“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”

“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”

“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.

“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.

“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”

Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”

A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.

As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”

“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom

They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.

The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.

“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”

“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”

They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.

It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.

“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”

“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.

Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.

“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.

“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”

They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.

It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.

They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.

“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”

With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.

Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.

The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.

The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.

“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.

“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.

“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”

“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”

“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.

“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”

The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.

“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”

He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.

“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.

“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.

The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.

A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.

""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.

""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""

A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,

No Service.

His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""

""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.

""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""

Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.

Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.

He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.

He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.

""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""

At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.

Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.

The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.

A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.

The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""

Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.

As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.

Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.

""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.

Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.

She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described as a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud

Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.

She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface began to stir, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.

""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment.""

There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""

He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.

Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/[r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/). The page loaded a list of stories and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration. He opened a fresh document on his computer and began to take notes, his fingers flying across the keyboard, already building, the foundations, of his next masterpiece.",1,1764776766.0,CreepyPastaHunters,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1pd7mon,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pd7mon/dont_let_dating_apps_destroy_your_mental_health/,Don't Let Dating Apps Destroy Your Mental Health,"M26, used dating apps a fair bit back in the day. If you're a man using a dating app, please don't let the lack of matches or responses get to you. Here's why.

1 - Apps are totally dominated by Male users seeking Women. Without humble bragging, I'm conventionally attractive, tall and broad, and I have a horrible time on these apps. I've retaken photos, put group photos, tried everything. It is what it is. Every girl I like, 100 other men have done the same.

2 - A lot of Women use these apps for an ego boost. There is nowhere a woman can go where she will get more attention and praise handed to her on a plate than a dating app full of desperate men who feel they've run out of options. I know several women who match with guys just to reflect on ""oh so I could have him"", without any intention to talk to him. 

3 - Women don't find dating apps romantic. Now this isn't universal, but deep down most women really don't feel the same romance from speaking to somebody on a dating app. If you match with a girl on an app and somebody else caught her eye as they got chatting in a coffee shop, YOU will not be a priority.

4 - Men on dating apps have a bad reputation. Women get sent all sorts. D\*ck pics without being asked, praise from desperate men that they know they haven't earned and an overall culture of men wanting to f\*ck them above anything else. If you match with her on a dating app, you need to prove you're not one of these guys, which isn't easy when you're not speaking to her face to face.

5 - The apps are designed to make MONEY. The apps as sickening as it is are designed to keep you gagging for somebody to finally love you. The more desperate and alone you feel, the more you begin feeling willing to start paying for ""higher exposure"". The apps absolutely make 95% of their profits from men. You are a commodity and it's in their best interest to keep you digging. 

Conclusion: Once you stop engaging with women in day to day life, seeking social bonds with women or making any kind of effort to speak to women in the real world, and exclusively use dating apps as your way to speak to them, you are heading down a very dark path. 

Rejection in the real world is less painful imho. You get context. You get understanding. Rejection on dating app is invisibility. You are not acknowledged or given any context to why nobody is interested. And you can build a narrative that 1000 women have rejected you when the vast majority were swarmed with so many other matches that they never saw you. No matter how painful being rejected by a girl in the real world is, it won't feel like 1000 women saw you and said no.

Please believe me when I say your success rate in the real world vs on an app is night and day. A lot of you aren't comfortable with real world stuff. Honestly if you're stuck in this soul destroying loop right now, your ONLY job is to stop using these apps, get involved in spaces where you can speak to women, and make it a mission to get rejected so that you stop fearing it so much. Because if you were truly okay with being rejected, you wouldn't need a dating app in the first place. And women know this.

Go and get rejected in the real world and feel what its like. Get used to it and suddenly you're not invisible anymore. You don't need to express interest in 1000 women for somebody to be keen.",3,1764776600.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1pd7mib,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1pd7mib/aio_after_being_roughly_shoulder_checked_on_the/,AIO after being roughly shoulder checked on the sidewalk? (NYC),"(Throwaway account because, to be honest, I feel embarrassed by this whole encounter)

I was walking on the crosswalk on the way to work, just reaching the corner of the street. This guy was barreling down the sidewalk in my direction, and I thought I could quickly cross his path to the left to get out of his way as the coffee shop entrance I was headed to was just to his left. It was a split second decision that I know was probably not the correct choice — I try to practice good sidewalk etiquette and know to stay to the right, which I would have done if I was not turning left. Unfortunately, I misjudged my speed versus his speed.

This guy had roughly 3 feet of empty space to his left that he could have quickly sidestepped me. Instead, he purposefully rams into my shoulder with such force that he knocked me into a scaffolding screw. The pain stopped me in my tracks, and I now have a large bruise on my hip. I was really shaken up, turned around to ask the guy what his problem was, and continued on once the pain subsided. He did not turn around or acknowledge that he hit me at all when I yelled out to him.

I get it — I've lightly shoulder checked people too when they are in the way (walking 3-4 people deep, not moving at all/blocking the sidewalk, etc). But I've never used as much force as to fully knock someone over, and if there is space for me to move a few inches without affecting my gait, I will do so. This guy had plenty of time & space to adjust his trajectory but I guess didn't want to.

When I got to work, I spent about a few minutes crying in the bathroom and trying to pull myself together. It had me really shaken up — I've never been hit/shoved/slammed into that hard by a stranger before, especially not hard enough to leave a bruise.

AIO over this whole encounter? I know I could have done things differently, but it's hard for me to move past this, and I feel kind of stupid.",2,1764776589.0,AIO,16,0.75,False

Been thinking about starting my own retail business, but I live in an area with limited + high priced commercial rentals. I've seen a few businesses online and in-person that seem to operate out of a small shed/barn (coffee shops/cafes, vintage retail, produce, etc.) Some of them seem like movable tiny homes, others seems stationary. Pretty cute and cozy if done well!

I wanted to know if anyone had any insight into the logistics of this or experience running a business out of a ""shed""? Do you just buy a shed and find a piece of land to lease? Do you find that online or just approach people with land in an area you'd be interested in being located? Is it more economical than a traditional rental agreement? Mostly curious for the future!

# Tips for Finding Halal Food in Midtown Manhattan

# Timing Your Visit

Midtown lunch rush runs 12:00-1:30 PM on weekdays. Quick-serve spots have long lines during this window. Try eating at 11:30 AM or after 2 PM for faster service. Dinner gets busy 6:00-8:00 PM, especially near theaters before evening shows (usually 7 or 8 PM curtain).

# Multiple Locations

Several restaurants in this guide have multiple Midtown locations (Omar's has three). If one location is packed or closed, check if there's another nearby.

# Verify Halal Certification

All restaurants listed serve halal meat, but certification types vary. If you follow specific zabihah requirements, it's worth confirming with the restaurant. Most display certificates or can provide supplier information if asked.

# Pre-Theater Timing

If you're seeing a Broadway show, aim to finish dinner by 6:45 PM for a 7:00 PM show or 7:45 PM for an 8:00 PM show. Restaurants near theaters understand this timing and can usually accommodate.

# Delivery & Takeout

Most restaurants in this guide are on UberEats, DoorDash, Seamless, and Grubhub. Delivery fees vary but expect $3-8 depending on distance. Pickup usually saves 20-30% versus delivery.

# Street Food Options

Beyond sit-down restaurants, Midtown has numerous halal carts. The most established carts are around 53rd & 6th Avenue, outside Penn Station, and near Port Authority. Carts typically serve from 11 AM to late night.

Driving to Midtown is expensive and time-consuming. Most restaurants are within a 5-10 minute walk from subway stations:

* **34 St-Penn Station** (1/2/3/A/C/E)

1pd7ia4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1pd7ia4/checklist_the_hidden_wordpress_performance_issues/,Checklist: The Hidden WordPress Performance Issues That Slow Sites After 100k Visitors,"The strangest thing I learned after crossing 100k monthly visitors: your site doesn’t slow down where you expect it to.  
  
Most people blame caching or hosting. I did too.  
Turned out the real slowdown came from tiny background things I never checked until it hurt.

Here’s the checklist I wish someone gave me before I spent two weeks chasing bottlenecks like a detective with too much coffee:

**Hidden WordPress Performance Issues I Only Noticed After 100k+ Visitors**

• Background tasks piling up quietly  
• Database tables growing in weird directions  
• Third party scripts adding 200–400 ms out of nowhere  
• WooCommerce fragments regenerating on pages that shouldn’t trigger them  
• “Light” plugins creating slow queries only visible at scale  
• Orphan data left after updates sitting inside wp\_options  
• wp-cron firing during checkout when traffic surges

And the funniest part?  
At 50k visitors everything looked stable.  
At 120k, it felt like trying to drive a small car carrying eight people and a goat. It moved, but it complained.

**A quick story from earlier this year:**  
One Woo site I manage averaged around 2.1 seconds TTFB during normal traffic. Nothing alarming.  
Then a seasonal spike hit. Traffic nearly doubled.  
TTFB shot up to 7.4 seconds, PHP workers sat at 90%, CPU barely had breathing room, and users were refreshing carts like angry gamers.

The twist? We didn’t deploy anything new.

The real issue came from a combination of two things:  
• A currency conversion plugin recalculating prices every request  
• A search plugin doing partial index rebuilds at high traffic times

Both behaved fine at lower traffic. Both became bullies at scale.

Fixing it was straightforward once identified:  
I disabled the dynamic conversion mode, moved indexing to an off-peak cron, and cleaned around 38 MB of autoloaded trash data. TTFB settled back near 2.3 seconds.

**If you’re anywhere near 100k monthly visitors, run through this list:**

☐ Check autoloaded options. Anything over 1 MB deserves inspection  
☐ Review wp\_actionscheduler tables regularly  
☐ Disable Woo fragments on pages that don’t need them  
☐ Move search indexing to off-peak hours  
☐ Waterfall test third party scripts  
☐ Run a 24-hour slow query log  
☐ Test your site with object caching off to reveal real weak points

And here’s a myth I’ve stopped believing:  
“Object caching solves scale problems.”  
It helps, yes.  
But it hides the messy parts. When caching hiccups, the truth shows up fast.

By the way, have you ever noticed how running WooCommerce at scale feels like running a restaurant kitchen? You don’t speed service up by repainting the dining room. You fix the fridge, clean the prep table, and make sure no one is bumping into each other.

Small aside: I share deeper breakdowns like this in my newsletter, The WP Stack. The link’s in my profile if anyone wants to dig into the full performance audit framework. No pressure, just sharing for those who like these kinds of deep dives.

What hidden performance issue surprised you the most once your traffic grew?",0,1764776331.0,Wordpress,8,0.2,False
1pd7i0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArenaTracker/comments/1pd7i0y/ultimate_perfection_of_life/,ultimate perfection of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1pd7fli,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1pd7fli/i_got_my_focus_back/,I got my focus back,"Three months ago, I couldn’t go 10 minutes without checking my phone. Instagram, Reddit, YouTube shorts—I’d bounce between them like I was chasing something but never catching it. Every night I’d tell myself “just a few more swipes,” and suddenly it was 2 AM and I felt sick, wired, and empty. In the morning I was a zombie. Not tired like I needed sleep—more like my brain was...fried. Groggy. Unmotivated. I’d sit down to work or study and couldn’t focus on anything for longer than a few minutes.

It hit me one afternoon when I was walking to class and realized I hadn’t *looked up* at the sky in weeks. That’s how disconnected I was—from people, from nature, from myself. I was always looking down at a screen, reacting, consuming. I didn’t even feel like I had original thoughts anymore. I was just passively scrolling life away.

I decided enough was enough.

The first week was the hardest. I deleted the big ones (TikTok, Insta, X) and tried going 24 hours without social media. The discomfort was real—like withdrawal. I’d get this phantom twitch to reach for my phone, just to *do something*. I was bored, anxious, irritable. But I kept going. I started doing little swaps: a book instead of my phone in bed. A walk when I felt that itch to scroll. I also began journaling for 5 minutes each night—nothing fancy, just dumping whatever was in my head.

By the second week, something weird happened. I felt… quieter. My brain wasn’t racing all the time. I could sit with my own thoughts again. I even caught myself humming while making coffee—like I was enjoying my own company again.

To stay consistent, I started using a little tracker app on my phone. I know, irony. But it actually helped. I’d log habits like “no social media after 9pm,” “read for 15 minutes,” or “morning walk.” Every day I stuck to them, I’d get a little visual boost. There was something about seeing my streak grow and my “mental clarity” points rise that kept me going. One night I almost broke my streak, but I remembered how good it felt to actually be in control—and that kept the phone in my pocket.

It’s been 90 days now, and I don’t even crave the scroll anymore. I finish books. I’ve started drawing again. My sleep is better, my attention span is *back*, and I’m more present with people. I even have ideas again—like real, creative thoughts I want to write down or act on.

To anyone who feels like their phone owns them: you’re not broken, and it’s not too late. The dopamine pull is real, but so is your ability to take it back. Start with 10 minutes. Then an hour. Track it. Celebrate it. And when it sucks, remind yourself: freedom feels better than any feed ever will.",0,1764776161.0,getdisciplined,5,0.5,False

After School – Melissa’s Big Surprise

When I got home, I dropped my bag on the couch and was about to collapse with a snack when Melissa suddenly said,

> “Don’t get too comfy, Amy. We’re going out tonight.”



I blinked. “Where? Grocery store comfy? Or real clothes comfy?”

She smiled that soft, elegant smile of hers and said,

> “Real clothes. My colleague and I arranged something special.
We’re going to see the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree tonight.”



I almost fell over.
“THE Rockefeller tree? Like, the huge one in all the movies?!”

Mom walked in, already holding her handbag.
“Yup. Melissa’s colleague works nearby and invited all of us. So hurry up, girls. Coats. Scarves. Shoes. Now.”

Suddenly the whole house exploded into activity:

Jennifer checking subway times,

Vicky yelling, “Wear something warm, not just cute!”,

Heather searching for her beanie,

Gillian reminding everyone of “optimal walking speed in crowded pedestrian zones,”

Linda trying to pick which boots looked “festive but fast,”

Nina grabbing gloves for everyone,

Shelley just chanting, “TREE! TREE! TREE!”


And me?
I was trying to zip my coat while my belly complained about how much snack it wanted before we left.

At Rockefeller Center

The city at night felt like one giant Christmas card.
Lights everywhere. Shop windows glowing. People in scarves and wool hats holding hot drinks and taking selfies.

When we reached Rockefeller Center, I actually stopped walking for a moment.

There it was.

The Christmas tree.
Huge. Sparkling. Covered in thousands of lights that looked like stars decided to come down and stand in one place. The gold, red, green, and white twinkled in the cold air, and the big star on top shimmered like something from a storybook.

Melissa’s colleague, a kind woman named Caroline, waved us over to the perfect viewing spot she’d saved.
“I knew you’d love this,” she said to Melissa. “All those lights… like flowers made of electricity.”

That sounded exactly like something Melissa would say.

Mom squeezed my shoulder and whispered,
“Look, Amy. Isn’t it beautiful?”

I nodded so hard my scarf almost slipped.
“It’s like the whole world decided to be cozy together.”

Sisters, Skaters & Hot Chocolate

We watched the skaters below spin and wobble on the ice rink.
Nina and Shelley kept pointing out people who almost fell but didn’t.
Heather said, “One day, I’m going to skate right here. Fast.”
Vicky replied, “Only if you don’t crash into tourists.”

Jennifer took a ton of photos of all of us — some serious, some silly.
One had everyone smiling nicely.
The next one had me mid-laugh with my belly clearly visible under my puffy coat.
“Delete that one!” I said.
“Nope,” Jennifer replied. “That’s the real you. Happy.”

We bought hot chocolate from a nearby cart.
It was so warm and sweet that my belly calmed down for once.
I held the cup close to my face, letting the steam warm my nose while I stared up at the tree lights.

For a moment, everything felt quiet —
even with all the city sounds around us.


---

Going Back Home

On the way home, the train was full of people carrying shopping bags and talking about presents.
My sisters were sleepy but still chatting:

Melissa said she wanted to paint the tree later from memory.

Gillian wanted to calculate how many bulbs were up there.

Linda said, “Doesn’t matter, I just know it was perfect.”


Mom looked tired but happy.
“It was worth the trip,” she said.

When we finally got home, I changed into my pajamas and flopped onto my bed, still thinking about the tree.

From backyard mud challenges…
to Coffee Day smoothies…
to a giant glowing Christmas tree in New York.

Sometimes my life feels like a very weird, very funny, very sparkly TV series.

And honestly?
I kind of love it.

1pd7ezu,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuartzSurfacingStone/comments/1pd7ezu/why_quartz_is_the_smartest_surface_investment_for/,Why Quartz is the Smartest Surface Investment for Vacation Rentals — And Why QSS Leads the Way,"In the vacation rental industry, durability, cleanliness, and aesthetic appeal directly impact guest satisfaction and booking potential. One of the most effective ways to elevate a rental property, while reducing long-term maintenance costs, is upgrading to quartz surfaces. And no provider delivers more value, selection, or reliability than Quartz Surfacing and Stones (QSS).



Below, we break down why quartz is the best surfacing choice for high-traffic rentals, and how QSS helps property owners choose materials that strengthen ROI and guest experience.



**Quartz: A High-Performance Surface Built for Rental Properties**



Vacation rentals experience significantly more use than traditional homes. With numerous guests cooking, entertaining, and preparing in bathrooms, surfaces must stand up to consistent wear.



Quartz is engineered for exactly this:

* Non-porous and highly stain-resistant
* Requires no sealing
* Withstands spills, oils, cosmetics, wine, and cleaning products
* Maintains its polished look with minimal upkeep



To explore hospitality-grade slabs designed for durability and beauty, visit the [QSS Quartz Slab Collection](https://quartzsurfacingandstones.com/product-category/quartz-slab/).



**Why Quartz Is So Stain-Resistant**

Quartz blends natural crystals with advanced resin binders, creating a dense surface that liquids simply cannot penetrate. That means:



* Red wine wipes away easily
* Toothpaste and makeup don’t etch
* Coffee, oils, and sauces don’t stain
* Acidic foods won’t leave marks



This is especially important for short-term rentals where spills are common and turnover timelines are tight.



**The Real-World Benefits for Vacation Rental Hosts**

https://preview.redd.it/r3d3i4k2d05g1.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=976b2b9ea1584001b496c7fffe2ca3810d10b17f

**1. Faster Turnovers**

Cleaning teams save time since messes wipe off quickly without special treatment.



**2. A Luxury Look That Lasts**

Quartz maintains its shine, helping rentals photograph better, leading to more clicks and bookings.



**3. Lower Lifetime Costs**

With no sealing or stone refinishing required, quartz reduces long-term expenses dramatically.



For real-life examples of quartz used in high-traffic settings, browse the [QSS Project Gallery](https://quartzsurfacingandstones.com/qss-projects/).



**Design Flexibility for Any Style of Rental**



Quartz comes in a wide range of tones, veining styles, patterns, and finishes, making it suitable for beachfront rentals, urban lofts, cabins, luxury villas, and more.



To understand the craftsmanship, quality control, and sourcing behind each slab, check out [Why QSS](https://quartzsurfacingandstones.com/why-qss/), which highlights what sets their products apart in both durability and design consistency.



**Why Choose Quartz Surfacing and Stones (QSS)?**



With more than 30 years serving builders, designers, architects, and property owners, QSS is one of Houston’s most trusted surface suppliers.



Learn more about their story, mission, and decades of expertise on their [About Us](https://quartzsurfacingandstones.com/about-us/) page.



QSS offers a wide range of premium materials including:

* Quartz (including CQ Colors)
* Porcelain
* Glass panels



Whether you need high-luxury materials or budget-conscious upgrades, QSS offers solutions for every price point.



**Where Quartz Adds the Most Value in a Rental**

https://preview.redd.it/70fkfnmgd05g1.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ec1255392cd03645ccb0856c80c77083558215

**Kitchen Countertops**

Handles cooking, spills, staining, and heat better than most CQ Colors.



**Bathroom Vanities**

Resists cosmetics, skincare, hair dyes, toothpaste, and moisture.



**Wet Bars and Dining Areas**

Perfect for wine spills, cocktail mixing, and guest entertainment.



**Covered Outdoor Kitchens**

Certain quartz options can be used outdoors; for alternative outdoor-friendly surfaces, QSS also offers porcelain.



For rental owners looking for cost-saving options without sacrificing aesthetics, QSS provides several clearance categories:

* [American Quartz Clearance](https://quartzsurfacingandstones.com/product-category/clearance/american-quartz/)
* [B-Grade American Quartz Clearance](https://quartzsurfacingandstones.com/product-category/clearance/b-grade-american-quartz/)



These collections offer strong visual appeal and durability at more accessible price points.



**Care Tips to Keep Quartz Looking New**

Quartz is low maintenance, but these steps help maintain its appearance:

* Clean with mild soap or pH-neutral cleaners
* Avoid placing hot pots directly on the surface
* Use cutting boards for knives
* Wipe spills promptly (even though they won’t penetrate)



**A Long-Term Investment With High ROI**

https://preview.redd.it/j5qlcyk4d05g1.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=5521cedab083dfcddfa289f4ae4a54c1b82494b8

Quartz boosts guest satisfaction, improves listing photos, accelerates turnovers, and reduces maintenance expenses, all of which increase your rental’s profitability.



And when sourced through a reputable provider like QSS, you get consistent quality, long-term durability, and a polished, modern look that keeps guests returning.



**Upgrade Your Vacation Rental With QSS Today**

For rental owners ready to elevate their property with beautiful, durable, and stain-resistant surfaces, Quartz Surfacing and Stones is a standout partner.

1pd7eg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pd7eg4/lelit_bianca_v3_3000/,Lelit Bianca v3 [$3000],"Hi all,

Been using a Sage Barista Touch Impress for 18 months and recently took it to the next level by using a WDT, distribution tool, manual tamper and bottomless portafilter.

I was astonished how better the coffee tasted as a result.

As I use the sage to purely grind and produce an espresso shot now (also manually milk steam), I’m thinking it’s time to upgrade the machine.

Worktop space is the prime constraint for me, especially the height and depth.  Therefore, having performed extensive research, I’m drawn towards the Lelit Bianca v3 due to the ability to move the water container from side to rear (note: I won’t be able to hook up to water mains at this time) which potentially puts the dimensions at the right footprint for me.

Do any of you have a Bianca with the water tank side mounted and if so could kindly let me know the HxWxD dimensions?

Or indeed, if you have any alternate suggestions?  I wanted the ECM Synkronika II or the Profitec Drive but sadly cannot accommodate the size (height or depth).

Happy to hear any advice in general regarding the Bianca v3 and whether it’s a good purchase as we head into 2026.  Or indeed if you can advise an alternative for up to £2500 (UK based)

1pd7dpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Which-Pool-1689/comments/1pd7dpi/lay_off_101/,Lay off 101,"Former HR here - subtle signs your company is preparing for layoffs

I’ve been through 3 rounds of layoffs (twice in HR, once when I was also laid off), and there’s a pattern that emerges before the axe falls. Not trying to create paranoia, but if you’re seeing multiple signs on this list, it might be time to update your resume.

This got long, so I’ve broken it down by timeline and severity. Hopefully this helps someone see what’s coming and prepare accordingly.

EARLY WARNING SIGNS (3-6 months out)

Financial and strategic shifts:

Hiring freeze gets announced, especially if it’s sudden or poorly explained. When companies say “we’re being strategic about growth” out of nowhere, that’s HR-speak for “we’re about to cut costs aggressively.” Pay attention to whether it’s a soft freeze (critical roles only) or hard freeze (literally nobody).

Executives start talking about “efficiency,” “operational excellence,” “doing more with less,” or “rightsizing” in all-hands meetings. Once leadership starts using these phrases repeatedly, start paying attention. They’re preparing employees psychologically for cuts.

The company misses earnings or revenue targets multiple quarters in a row, or leadership keeps revising guidance downward. Public companies especially - check their investor relations page and quarterly calls.

Consultants show up. Specifically McKcKinsey, Bain, Deloitte, or similar firms. They’re not there to make things better for employees - they’re there to identify “redundancies” and provide cover for cuts leadership already wants to make. If you see consultants doing org chart analysis or “efficiency studies,” that’s a massive red flag.

Leadership changes at the top. New CEO, CFO, or COO often means new priorities. New executives frequently want to “make their mark” within the first 100 days, and layoffs are a quick way to cut costs and restructure.

Budget and resource signals:

Training and development budgets disappear. Conference approvals get denied, software licenses don’t get renewed, that certification you wanted gets tabled indefinitely. When companies stop investing in employee development, they’re not planning long-term with current staff.

Discretionary spending freezes. Team outings canceled, holiday parties scaled back or eliminated, small perks disappear. These are the easiest costs to cut first.

Delayed or frozen merit increases and bonuses. If annual raises get “postponed” or bonuses are cut despite decent performance, the company is hoarding cash for something.

Open headcount gets quietly closed. You might not notice a hiring freeze officially, but those three open roles on your team just stop being discussed.

Cultural and messaging changes:

The “we’re a family” messaging intensifies. Ironically, when companies start really pushing the culture stuff hard, it’s often because morale is tanking and they know what’s coming. Authentic culture doesn’t need constant reinforcement.

Town halls become more frequent but less substantive. Leadership is trying to control the narrative and keep people calm, but they’re not actually saying anything meaningful.

Internal communications shift tone. Messages become more formal, more carefully worded, more legal-sounding. This usually means lawyers are reviewing everything.

Real estate and facilities:

Office consolidation starts being discussed. Subleasing space, breaking leases early, or suddenly pushing hybrid/remote work after being office-focused. Real estate is expensive and often the first place companies look to cut.

Facilities staff reductions. If maintenance, security, or reception teams shrink, that’s a leading indicator.

MEDIUM-TERM SIGNS (1-3 months out)

The ones people miss:

Your manager starts acting weird in 1-on-1s. They seem distant, can’t give you clear answers about future projects, or suddenly don’t want to talk about your career development, or they cancel 1-on1s. They often know 4-6 weeks before you do and are terrible at hiding it. Watch for:

- Avoiding eye contact
- Being vague about Q2/Q3 planning
- Not fighting for resources they normally would
- Seeming stressed or checked out

Cross-functional projects get canceled or put on hold indefinitely. If that big initiative involving multiple teams suddenly loses steam, it’s often because leadership knows the teams won’t exist soon.

Reorganizations that don’t make sense. When they shuffle reporting structures or combine teams in weird ways, they’re often preparing for consolidation. The reorg is the setup; the layoff is the follow-through.

Senior people start leaving and aren’t replaced. When your VP quietly exits and the role just disappears or gets absorbed, that’s a restructure preview. Execs often see the writing on the wall before layoffs and jump ship.

The “high performer” narrative shifts. Suddenly everyone’s being evaluated more critically, PIPs increase, and the bar for “meeting expectations” gets higher. They’re building paper trails.

HR and administrative signals:

HR schedules random meetings with employees to “check in.” This can be them gauging morale, but it can also be them identifying who might be problems during layoffs (ie, who might sue or cause issues).

Increased focus on documentation. HR suddenly cares a lot about having everything in writing, attendance records are scrutinized, minor policy violations are documented. They’re building files.

Anonymous surveys about “organizational effectiveness” or “role clarity.” They’re identifying redundancies and overlapping responsibilities.

Operational changes:

Vendors get cut or renegotiated aggressively. If the company is trying to save money everywhere, labor costs are next.

Projects shift from innovation to maintenance. All the exciting new work stops, and teams are just keeping lights on. This suggests they don’t believe in long-term investment right now.

Contractors and temps disappear first. This is always the canary in the coal mine. If contractors are let go en masse, full-time employees are usually 4-8 weeks behind.

Financial desperation moves:

The company takes on debt or seeks additional funding under unfavorable terms. This suggests cash flow problems.

Asset sales. Selling off business units, real estate, IP, or other assets to raise cash.

Delayed payments to vendors. If your company is stretching payables or late on bills, they’re struggling with cash.


IMMEDIATE RED FLAGS (2-4 weeks out)

The “oh shit” tier:

You or your team suddenly gets asked to document all your processes in detail, create runbooks, or do knowledge transfers “for continuity.” They’re preparing for people to be gone and don’t want institutional knowledge walking out the door.

Managers have mysterious meetings that aren’t on the calendar, or meetings that say “leadership sync” with no agenda. Often they’re being told how to “rank” their teams (stack ranking) or getting trained on how to deliver termination news.

HR blocks calendar time that’s marked private across the entire organization on the same day. That’s layoff day. Usually a Wednesday or Thursday.

Managers seem panicked or are suddenly unavailable. They’re either in planning meetings or mentally preparing for what they have to do.

IT or Security starts asking random questions about access, or you notice permissions audits. They’re preparing to revoke access quickly.

Conference rooms get blocked all day with “private” meetings. Those are the termination meetings.

The parking lot has way more cars than usual early in the morning on a random day. Leadership arrives early to prepare and coordinate.

The final 48 hours:

Executives all happen to be “in the office” on the same day when they’re usually remote or traveling. They want to show their faces and deliver messages in person.

Your manager asks for a “quick sync” with no context, or you get a calendar invite for early morning with just “meeting.” That’s often the termination conversation.

You notice coworkers disappearing into conference rooms and not coming back, or leaving with boxes. If it’s happening, it’s happening to multiple people today.

Email access starts acting weird, VPN connections drop, or badge access to certain areas stops working. IT is already starting to shut you down.


WHAT TO DO - ACTION PLAN

Preparation phase (as soon as you see early signs)

Update LinkedIn immediately. Make sure your profile is complete and compelling. Turn on “open to work” privately so recruiters can see it but your company can’t.

Refresh your resume and tailor it for your target roles. Have multiple versions ready for different job types. Get it reviewed by someone who knows your industry.

Document your accomplishments with metrics. Revenue generated, costs saved, projects delivered, teams built. Save this somewhere personal, not company equipment.

Save important files legally. Performance reviews, reference letters, samples of your work (that aren’t confidential), documentation of your achievements. Email them to your personal account or save to personal cloud storage. Do NOT take confidential company information, client data, or proprietary code.

Screenshot or save your LinkedIn recommendations and endorsements. Sometimes people leave and delete their profiles.

Reconnect with your network NOW while you’re employed. It’s easier to get coffee as a “catch up” than as a desperate job seeker. Reach out to old colleagues, mentors, recruiters you’ve worked with.

Financial preparation:

Build emergency fund if possible. Even an extra month of expenses helps.

Understand your benefits. Know your PTO balance, how severance works at your company (if there’s a standard package), what COBRA costs, when your stock vests, and what happens to your 401k.

Reduce expenses where you can. Not to panic level, but maybe hold off on big purchases.

Check if you have any loans against 401k or obligations tied to employment. Some companies require repayment upon termination.

Legal and administrative:

Keep records of everything. If you suspect you’re being targeted unfairly (discrimination, retaliation), document it meticulously with dates and witnesses.

Check your employment contract for non-compete, non-solicitation, and IP assignment clauses. Know what you signed.

Mental preparation:

This is not about your worth. Layoffs are business decisions, usually driven by executive mistakes or market conditions. Even top performers get cut.

Have a plan for how you’ll spend day one after a layoff. Whether it’s updating your resume, going for a run, or calling a friend, having a plan helps you not spiral.

Tell your partner or trusted person what might be coming. Don’t suffer alone or let it blindside your household.

If/when it happens:

Don’t sign anything immediately. You usually have time to review severance agreements. Consider having an employment lawyer review it, especially if it includes non-compete or release clauses.

Negotiate if possible. Severance, extended healthcare, references, job search support, equity vesting. The worst they can say is no, and many companies have wiggle room.

File for unemployment immediately. Even if you get severance, you might be eligible. Don’t leave money on the table.

Ask for a neutral reference or letter of recommendation before you leave. Much easier to get this on day one than six months later.

Understand what’s happening to your benefits. COBRA deadlines, life insurance conversion options, FSA/HSA balances.

Get contact info for colleagues you want to stay in touch with. Once you lose email access, it’s hard to reconnect.

Job search strategy:

Take a day or two to process emotionally. You don’t have to start applying immediately.

Quality over quantity. Targeted applications with customized materials beat spray-and-pray.

Use your network first. Most jobs are filled through referrals. Let people know you’re looking.

Consider contract or freelance work to bridge gaps. It keeps money coming in and shows you stayed active.

Be honest in interviews about the layoff. “Company went through restructuring” or “position was eliminated due to budget cuts” is fine. Most interviewers get it, especially if layoffs were public.

WHAT NOT TO DO

Don’t panic or make it obvious you’re job hunting. Don’t print your resume on the company printer, don’t take recruiting calls at your desk, don’t update LinkedIn with “OPEN TO WORK” publicly while still employed.

Don’t badmouth the company publicly. Even if you’re furious, keep it professional. The industry is smaller than you think.

Don’t stop doing your job. Keep performing until the end. You want good references and you never know what might change.

Don’t burn bridges with your manager. Even if they’re delivering bad news, they’re probably just doing what they were told. Stay professional.

Don’t take things that aren’t yours. Seriously, don’t steal company property, access data you shouldn’t, or do anything that could give them cause for termination instead of layoff. You want that severance and unemployment eligibility.

AFTERMATH - IF YOU SURVIVE THE CUT

Survivor’s guilt is real. It’s okay to feel relieved and also sad for colleagues who were let go.

Your workload is about to increase dramatically. Set boundaries early and document what’s not getting done. Don’t try to do three people’s jobs.

Start looking anyway. Companies that do one round of layoffs often do more. Plus, the culture and workload might not be sustainable.

Living and working in Delhi can be a whirlwind. Between demanding work hours, long commutes, social commitments, and maybe side-projects or hobbies, finding time for home upkeep often feels impossible. Yet, a clean and organized home isn’t a luxury — it's essential for your physical and mental well-being.

https://preview.redd.it/7rpe4b1qb05g1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c710840ec23a0a72339639eaee75e45bbf8162e7

Dust, pollution, heavy traffic, and hectic lifestyles combine to make home maintenance more challenging than in quieter towns. But with the right daily cleaning checklist — tailored for busy professionals — you can keep your living space fresh, welcoming, and healthy — without spending hours each day.

This blog walks you through a realistic, efficient, and effective [**maid service delhi**](https://maidservicedelhi.com/)  for busy professionals in Delhi. Each task is optimized for minimal time yet maximum impact. If followed consistently, your home will stay neat throughout the week, reducing the stress and grime that pile up over time.





# Why Daily Cleaning Matters — Especially in Delhi

# 1. Pollution & Dust Are Constant Enemies

Delhi’s air — outside and inside — often carries dust, smog particles, and pollutants. Windows, doors, and even closed rooms accumulate dust quickly. Without daily attention, dust settles on surfaces, fabrics, and floors, aggravating allergies, clogging air filters, and making your home feel grimy.

# 2. Busy Lifestyle = Less Time, More Mess

Working professionals seldom get to clean on weekends only. By the time you return home, the place may already feel cluttered: discarded wrappers, cooking spills, undone laundry, dishes piled up, etc. Leaving these unattended leads to larger cleaning workloads — mentally draining and time-consuming.

# 3. Mental Peace Begins at Home

A clean home affects mood, productivity, and overall well-being. Coming home to clutter, dust, and mess can add to stress. A tidy, sanitized, well-organized space helps you unwind, sleep better, and even improves focus when you work from home.

# 4. Hygiene & Health Are Non-Negotiable

From kitchen spills to bathroom moisture, apartment living in Delhi — often involving small spaces — can quickly become breeding grounds for germs, mold, or pests. Regular cleaning keeps these risks under control.

Given these factors, a daily cleaning ritual isn’t a luxury — it’s a necessity for anyone juggling modern urban life. But the key is **simplicity and consistency**. A short, manageable daily checklist beats long, daunting cleaning marathons on weekends.





# Designing the Daily Cleaning Checklist: Principles

Before diving into room-by-room tasks, here are the principles guiding this checklist:

* **Time-efficient**: Each day’s tasks should take **20–30 minutes max**.  
* **Room-by-room rotation**: Spread effort — don’t try to clean the entire home every day.  
* **High-impact cleaning**: Focus on surfaces and areas where dust, dirt, or mess accumulate fastest.  
* **Minimal equipment**: Use basic cleaning tools — mop, broom, microfiber cloths, trash bag, multi-purpose cleaner, dish soap.  
* **Easy to sustain**: The checklist should feel doable even after a long workday.  
* **Prioritize hygiene**: Bathrooms, kitchen, and frequently touched surfaces get special attention.  

With that in mind, here’s a sample daily cleaning checklist tailored for busy professionals in Delhi.





# 🏠 Daily Cleaning Checklist — Room-by-Room & Task-by-Task

Below is a suggested schedule. You can tweak it based on the size of your home, number of occupants, and your available time.

# Morning / Before Leaving Home (5–10 mins)

* **Open windows for 5–10 minutes** — ventilate the apartment, let fresh air in (if air quality allows).  
* **Make your bed / straighten pillows and covers** — a made bed instantly makes the room look cleaner.  
* **Quick floor-sweep of living room & bedroom** (if dust is visible) — especially in high-traffic apartments.  
* **Declutter key surfaces** — coffee table, dining table, desk. Put away items lying around (mugs, clothes, bags, etc.).  

*Tip:* Doing a quick 5–10 minute tidy-up before you leave ensures you return to a manageable, clean space — and doesn’t eat into your evening time.





# Evening / After Return — 15–25 mins

Focus on high-impact zones: kitchen, living spaces, bathroom — where dust, dirt, or mess accumulate fastest.

# Kitchen (5–10 mins)

* Wash all used dishes — plates, utensils, cookware, mugs immediately after use.  
* Wipe down kitchen counters, stove top, sink, and kitchen table — remove spills, crumbs, water stains.  
* Sweep floor quickly to avoid accumulation of leftover crumbs or dust.  
* If you cooked, wipe down cooker chimney / exhaust area if needed (especially if oil was used).  
* Put away all groceries, kitchen tools — don’t leave wrappers or food packets lying around.  

# Bathroom (5 mins)

* Wipe sink and countertop — clean away toothpaste, soap residue, water stains.  
* Rinse and wipe shower area / bathtub / tiles — prevent moisture build-up.  
* Use a small brush or mop to quickly clean floor if there’s water/dirt.  
* Empty bathroom trash bin if full or contains used tissue/ sanitary waste.  
* Hang towels properly; avoid damp towels lying around (this reduces mildew / odor build-up).  

# Living Room / Common Area (5–10 mins)

* Dust visible surfaces: coffee table, TV stand, shelf tops — use a microfiber cloth or duster.  
* Quickly fold/arrange sofas, cushions; clear any clutter like magazines, papers, wrappers.  
* Sweep / vacuum if there’s visible dust or debris.  
* Straighten rugs / mats; shake cushions or rugs if required (weather permitted).  
* Garbage management: empty small trash bins (dustbins, kitchen bin) — especially if there are food scraps or wet waste.  

# Bedroom (if used during day — 2–3 mins)

* Put away any clothes lying around (dry or wet).  
* Quickly dust bedside table, windowsill, or desk (if you use laptop/ work from home).  
* Open curtains or blinds for a few minutes to let in air and light (if privacy and AQ permit).  





# 🔁 Weekly & Twice-a-Week Tasks (To Supplement Daily Cleaning)

To maintain overall hygiene, couple the daily checklist with some periodic tasks. These don’t need to be done every day — once or twice per week is enough, but keep them scheduled so they don’t pile up.

* Mop floors thoroughly — even in rooms not used daily (bedroom, balcony, hallway).  
* Change bed sheets, pillow covers, and wash used towels.  
* Clean inside kitchen cabinets / fridge (wipe shelves; discard expired food or open packets prone to pests).  
* Deep-clean bathroom — scrub tiles, clean grout lines, descale faucets (especially with Delhi’s hard water).  
* Dust/ wipe electronic devices, remote controls, light switches, doorknobs (high-touch surfaces).  
* Check and empty dustbins thoroughly; sanitize bins if needed.  
* Clean windows/ window sills — dust and pollution settle quickly, especially on windows facing busy roads.  
* Take out garbage/ recyclables — dispose of waste properly, especially wet or food waste quickly to avoid pests and bad smells.  





# ⏱️ Time-Saving Tips for Busy Professionals

Even with a checklist, timing matters — here are smart strategies to make cleaning more manageable:

# 1. Set a daily alarm or reminder

Block out **20–30 minutes every evening** for cleaning as a fixed habit — just like brushing your teeth.

# 2. Do small tasks immediately

Wash dishes right after meals; wipe spills instantly; put used items away. Small tasks done quickly prevent bigger mess and make cleaning easier.

# 3. Use multi-purpose cleaning supplies

A good all-purpose cleaner, a microfiber cloth, a broom/mop, and a small dustbin with liner — enough for most daily tasks. Less clutter in cleaning equipment means easier clean-up.

# 4. Keep cleaning tools accessible

Store a small cleaning kit (cloth, spray cleaner, duster) in the kitchen or living area so cleaning doesn’t feel like an extra chore requiring extra effort.

# 5. Divide tasks logically

Don’t try to clean everything at once. Kitchen after dinner, bathroom right after shower, living room before watching TV — small segments throughout evening.

# 6. Make it social or habitual

If you live with family or flatmates: divide chores — one empties trash, one washes dishes, one wipes surfaces. Or do cleaning while listening to music/podcast — turning it into a relaxing unwind ritual.

# 7. Declutter regularly

Less clutter means less to clean. Avoid leaving items randomly; regularly discard or store things you don’t need.







# 🧠 Why This Routine Works — Even with a Hectic Delhi Life

* **Short & realistic:** No need to spend hours; daily 20–30 minute cleaning is doable even after a long day.  
* **Prevents build-up:** Dust, dirt, clutter never get a chance to settle — so home remains fresh.  
* **Saves weekends:** Since most cleaning is done daily/weekly, weekends stay free for rest or social time.  
* **Improves hygiene:** Regular kitchen & bathroom cleaning reduce risk of pests, stains, mildew, and bacteria build-up.  
* **Mental comfort:** Coming home to a neat space reduces stress, promotes relaxation, and even improves sleep.  
* **Sustainable:** You develop a habit — no more “I’ll clean tomorrow” excuses.  

# 🛡️ Additional Tips for Delhi-Specific Challenges

Living in Delhi presents certain challenges — high dust, pollution, humidity (in some seasons), hard water, and small apartments. Here’s how to adapt your cleaning routine accordingly:

# Dust & Pollution

* Use a **microfiber cloth or duster** instead of a feather duster — microfiber traps dust rather than just shifting it around.  
* Wipe **window sills, balconies, floor edges** at least twice a week — dust piles up quickly there.  
* After dusty days (e.g., wind, construction, pollution spikes), do a **quick sweep + wet mop** of living and bedroom floors.  

# Hard Water Effects (Bathrooms & Kitchen)

* Keep a **small squeegee or towel** handy near shower / sink — wipe moisture off tiles/ mirrors after use to prevent stains and hard-water deposits.  
* Use a **mild vinegar-based solution** (or recommended cleaners) once a week to wipe faucets, sink basins, tiles — helps reduce stains.  

# Compact Apartments / Shared Spaces

* Use **multi-functional furniture / storage boxes / hooks** — helps reduce clutter.  
* After guests visit, do a **quick reset**: fluff cushions, open windows, toss trash, wipe surfaces — makes a big difference in small spaces.  

# Time constraints & Mental Load

* On extremely busy days, at least do **kitchen + dishes + trash** — this alone keeps your home from getting messy fast.  
* Keep cleaning supplies simple and reachable — reduces friction to start cleaning.  
* If you travel often or stay late, try to schedule cleaning for **weekends only**, but split them into **two shorter sessions** rather than one long marathon.  





# 💡 Making Cleaning Work — Building Habits That Stick

Cleaning doesn’t have to be a chore you dread. With a little mindset shift, it can become part of your day — even relaxing. Here’s how to make it stick:

* **Treat cleaning like self-care.** See a clean home as part of your health and mental well-being.  
* **Reward yourself.** After cleaning, treat yourself to a cup of tea, your favorite snack, or a short TV break — make it a ritual.  
* **Involve family or flatmates.** Assign simple tasks daily: one washes dishes, another empties trash, another wipes surfaces. Shared workload = faster cleaning + shared responsibility.  
* **Keep a visible checklist.** A small checklist on the fridge or wall helps — check off tasks; small psychological satisfaction helps reinforce the habit.  
* **Don’t aim for perfection — aim for consistency.** It’s okay if the home isn’t spotless every day. The goal is a manageable, livable clean — not a showroom.  





# ✅ What a Week of Good Cleaning Looks — Real Life Scenario

Imagine this: it’s Friday evening. You’re done with work, exhausted. Instead of facing a mess, you walk into a home that’s tidy. The kitchen is clean (dishes done, counters wiped), the bathroom is fresh, the living room is uncluttered, trash is empty, and even your bed is neatly made.

You relax — read a book, call a friend, or watch a movie. On Saturday morning, you quickly change bed sheets, wash towels, mop floors. After 15–20 minutes, your home feels fresh, airy, and comfortable.

You don’t spend all weekend cleaning. Instead, your home stays a peaceful, pleasant space — not a project to tackle.

That’s the power of a daily cleaning checklist.





# ✨ Final Thoughts: A Clean Home, A Clear Mind

As a busy professional living in Delhi, you juggle many responsibilities. Work pressures, city commute, social duties — your time is precious. But neglecting your home doesn’t just affect cleanliness — it impacts your health, rest, and mental peace.

By adopting a simple, consistent, realistic daily cleaning checklist — or a weekly-plus-daily hybrid routine — you don’t just maintain your home; you create a sanctuary. A place where you return after work and truly unwind. A place that reflects calm, order, and care.

Remember: it’s not about spending hours cleaning — it’s about **building habits** that keep your home in shape, even when life is busy.

If you start this routine and stick to it, even partially, you’ll notice a difference within a week. Over a month, your home will feel more welcoming, healthier, and more peaceful.

I first got a Bunn MyCafe circa 2015 after seeing the love for Bunn here.  It did brew a killer single cup of drip coffee, using my grounds and no annoying K-Cups or pods.  

However, after 3 years it started ejecting the drawer of hot coffee grounds across the kitchen, almost hitting my baby.  Bunn said it was odd, and replaced our machine.  When it happened with the replacement, we ditched it.   

Bunn paused production, so we figured they fixed the problem.  When MyCafe was back in production we ordered a new one (2 years ago).  Despite cleaning and maintaining / descaling regularly, it's started ejecting the hot coffee drawer again.   (See photos)

We contacted Bunn, and they said we need to clean our screen in the drawer. (We do.) They sent us a new screen but it still does this. 

I can't believe the company is comfortable selling a machine that will begin to do such a dangerous thing after a few years of daily use.  It seems unsafe, unconscionable, and certainly NOT BIFL.  

I do pourover, but others in my family do not.  I'm hoping to find a single cup brewer that is safer than this Bunn mess.  ",21,1764775520.0,BuyItForLife,25,0.76,False

So time passed and a few weeks later I had my first argument with her and another friend of mine who knows her. His name was Coffee bref coffee , me and Khio had our first argument I don't remember but what I remember is that it changed our friendship from tac to tac. Coffee said it would strengthen our ties but it only widened the gap between us. I later confided, after the first argument that I loved Khio. I had known her for several weeks and it was reciprocal. Well, the good life what. But of course, I thought about it and decided that it was not worth losing her just for a short romantic relationship, plus she didn't want to go out with someone at the moment.  In short, a few days later she accused me of cheating on her and as proof her alibi ""one of her friends"" who told her a lie. That I had flirted with one of my friends! Can you imagine? Let's see! I'm not that kind of person! In short. So I tried to explain myself but she didn't want to hear anything she called me ""pick me"" and ""Drama makers"".

I'm so confused and so dissociative.

There's a million things, but this is one of the things I'm struggling to cope with. Someone please give me some perspective or...just anything.

I'll try make this short.

I'm 22F. I met this guy 31M earlier in the year online. We met up for coffee. There was Zero chemistry, but he was really nice. I've been in an abusive relationship previously and have also bee raped. I hadn't been out wjth anyone for like two years.

I decided that maybe if I focused on the fact he was so nice and not on looks that would fix my problem??

I saw him again, for a walk.

I saw him after that when he invited me to his house for dinner. Luckily I was on my period so when things started getting sexual, I had the ability to pull his hand away from my jeans and say ""I'm on my period."" He gave me a funny look and I panicked that he was going to get nasty so I said: ""But next time, don't worry.""

Next time rolls around. He's invited me to stay over night. I jumped at the opportunity to get away from my mother (she has BPD and has been so abusive) and accepted the invitation.

He picked me up on the day, we drove back to his. We made dinner, as I'm cooking he starts slapping my butt CONSTANTLY, this continues through the whole evening. Sometimes I said ""ow"" sometimes I screamed because I would get a fright and he'd slap me So fricken hard it honestly hurt.

We put a movie on, like a third of the way through we start kissing. Somewhere in my head I obviously knew when I accepted his invitation that things would obviously get sexual, but I thought I migjt be able to handle it and stand my ground this time.

NO.

He starts undoing my jeans, Takes his shirt off etc. I just go along with it. But I'm literally panicking and so so so so scared and not ready in the slightest to have sex. I couldn't say anything, can't verbalise it, can't move away, I just GO ALONG WITH IT. He starts actually having sex with me and it hurts so badly I can't describe the pain. But still I just can't say anything, I just keep going along with jt hoping and preying somehow it will stop. It doesn't.

I want him to use a condom and I think I manage to ask ""Do you have a condom?"" and he says ""Yeah."" but doesn't use it and I can't seem to stand up for myself and ask him to use one again.

That night we go to bed and he has sex with me again. It's even more painful because I'm tender from earlier. I'm so tense and not turned on in the slightest. He even says ""you don't seem comfortable."" I don't think I replied.

We go to sleep eventually, or he does, I'm still awake and in so much pain and so triggered I just want to get up and runaway out the door, but he lived in the middle of the countryside so no one and no where to run to.

I finally fall asleep for a bit. He wakes me up and is having sex with me. I fall asleep again and in the morning I wake up and he's on top of me AGAIN. This time he cums in side me. Then rolls over and says ""You're on BC aren't you?"" and I said ""No. I was on my period the other day, don't you remember?"" and he won't let me go home until he's taken me to the pharmacy to buy the morning after pill. He thanks me for getting it, because his Ex got pregnant and he had to get her to terminate it ?? Throughout the morning getting ready and stuff he slaps my butt as hard as he can when I'm least expecting it.

Anyway because I'm trapped wjth my mother somehow my idiotic self keeps seeing this guy. And basically every encounter goes like the first. He won't wear a condom, Is really rough with me, I'm in pain and never turned on and he always remarks how uncomfortable I always seem and I never have the ability to stand up for myself and just go along with it.

I legitimately feel broken ""down there"". I don't know if I'll ever be able to have sex again I'm so traumatised. I don't know why I'm so traumatised by it because he didn't rape me. As far as he was concerned it was all consensual and I wanted it even though I didn't, but he didn't know that.

I also wound up pregnant and he tried to guilt trip me into aborting jt, but that goes against everything I believe in. I ended up misscarrying at 7 weeks anyway which he doesn't know. And that has literally destroyed me too. I can't really get over that.

The sex though, I think I'm physically damaged down there. Imm so traumatised by it and I have nightmares and intrusive images about it. Psychologically I still feel the pain down there. I'm scared I'll never be able to trust any man again or have sex again. Why do I feel like this if he didn't rape me?

And how can I learn to say no and not freeze if I'm in this situation again?

They felt too small to matter, but after a month I saved over a hundred dollars without feeling like I was cutting anything out.

Then I realized this idea works online too. With tiktok‘s slash & free, I don’t treat it like a mission. I only use it when I’m restocking basics like paper towels or cleaning supplies. If the price drops, great. If it doesn’t, I just leave it. It’s more like a small bonus instead of a reason to buy more.

1pd6xou,https://www.reddit.com/r/findchinaschool/comments/1pd6xou/a_realistic_budget_for_an_international_student/,A Realistic Budget for an International Student in China (Beyond the Stipend),"Hey everyone,

One of the biggest questions I see from new applicants is: *""Can I actually live on the 3000 RMB/month stipend?""*

The short answer is **yes, absolutely.** But the long answer is: **it depends entirely on your city and your lifestyle.** After talking with hundreds of students across the country, here’s a realistic breakdown of where your money will go.

All prices are in Chinese Yuan (RMB). (Roughly $1 USD = 7 RMB)

# The Biggest Factor: Your City Tier

China isn't one single price point. Costs vary massively between cities.

* **Tier 1:** Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou. (Expensive)
* **Tier 2:** Nanjing, Wuhan, Chengdu, Tianjin, Hangzhou. (Moderate)
* **Tier 3 & below:** Harbin, Changsha, Lanzhou, etc. (Very Affordable)

# Monthly Cost Breakdown:

**1. Accommodation (The Game Changer)**

* **University Dorm (If covered by scholarship):** **¥0.** 
* **University Dorm (If you pay):** **¥800 - ¥1,500 / month.** Usually a shared room.
* **Renting Your Own Apartment:** 
   * *Tier 1 (Shanghai/Beijing):* A small studio or room in a shared flat will run you **¥3,000 - ¥5,000+**. Your entire stipend is gone on rent alone.
   * *Tier 2 (Nanjing/Wuhan):* Much more manageable at **¥1,500 - ¥2,500** for a decent place.

**2. Food (Your Best Friend: The Canteen)**

You can live very well on a small food budget in China.

* **University Canteen (食堂 - shítáng):** This is your secret weapon. A full, delicious meal can cost **¥8 - ¥15**. If you eat here twice a day, your monthly food bill could be as low as **¥600 - ¥900**.
* **Eating Out (Local Restaurants):** A decent noodle or rice dish is **¥20 - ¥40**. Western food (pizza, burgers) will be **¥50 - ¥100+**.
* **Realistic Food Budget:** If you mix canteen meals with eating out a few times a week, budget around **¥1,200 - ¥1,800 / month.**

**3. Transport & Utilities**

These costs are generally very low.

* **Phone & Data:** A solid 4G/5G plan with plenty of data is about **¥80 - ¥120 / month.**
* **Public Transport:** The metro is incredible and cheap. Most trips cost **¥3 - ¥6**. A monthly metro budget for daily travel is around **¥150 - ¥200**. Buses are even cheaper.
* **Utilities (if renting):** Water, electricity, and internet might add up to **¥200 - ¥300 / month.**

**4. Social Life & Everything Else**

This is entirely up to you.

* **Coffee:** A latte from a local chain is ¥20-25. Starbucks is ¥30-35.
* **Movie Ticket:** \~¥40
* **Gym Membership:** \~¥200-300/month
* **Weekend Travel:** A high-speed train ticket for a short trip can be ¥150-300 one-way.

# The Bottom Line: Two Sample Budgets

**Scenario 1: ""Smart Student"" in a Tier 2 City (e.g., Wuhan) on a Full Scholarship**

* Accommodation: ¥0 (Dorm is covered)
* Food: ¥1,300 (Mostly canteen, some restaurants)
* Transport/Phone: ¥250
* Social/Misc: ¥450
* **Total: \~¥2,000 / month.**
   * *Verdict:* You can easily live on the ¥3,000 stipend and still have ¥1,000 left over to save or travel.

**Scenario 2: ""Big City Life"" in Shanghai (Renting Your Own Place)**

* Accommodation: ¥3,500 (Renting a room)
* Food: ¥1,800
* Transport/Phone: ¥350
* Social/Misc: ¥800
* **Total: \~¥6,450 / month.**
   * *Verdict:* The scholarship stipend is not enough. You'll need significant personal savings.

Hope this gives you a clearer picture! The key is to pick your city wisely and make that university canteen your best friend. We have a channel in our student Discord where people share their exact city-by-city monthly budgets if you want to dive deeper.",1,1764775051.0,findchinaschool,0,1.0,False

It was the night of the company dinner, an occasion that everyone had been eagerly anticipating. Each employee was given the chance to select a dish from the menu, a small luxury amidst the daily grind of deadlines and meetings.

As I sat at the table, savoring the moment, the new intern, Sadie, abruptly seized the menu from my grasp. Her sudden action caught me off guard.

“The dishes are enough. No more ordering,” she declared with an air of authority that was utterly unwarranted.

I chose to ignore her brazen behavior, turning my attention to the waiter who stood patiently by my side. “I’ll have one Mac and cheese, please,” I said, my voice steady, determined to assert my choice.

But before I could even register my order, Sadie slammed the menu against my face, her eyes blazing with indignation.

“When I say you can’t order, you can’t order! Who do you think you are?” she spat, her tone laden with condescension.

The sharp edge of the menu grazed my cheek, leaving a stinging sensation that ignited a fire within me. My temper flared, and without thinking, I snatched the menu back and returned it to her face with a forceful smack. She let out a shriek of surprise, her bravado faltering for just a moment.

“Do you have any idea who I am? My father is Wesley Modine—the most significant client this company has!” she shouted, her voice rising with each word.

“Even the CEO treats me with respect. You dare to lay a hand on me? Believe me, I can have your sales title revoked and ensure the entire industry blacklists you!”

I froze, momentarily stunned by her words. Wesley Modine was not just a name to me; he was my biological uncle. The realization hit me like a wave crashing against the shore.

He was forty years old, perpetually single, and now I was faced with this revelation: since when did he have a daughter old enough to be in a position of power?

Sadie’s smug expression grew even more pronounced as she noticed my silence. “What, scared now? A gold-digger like you, relying solely on your looks to get sales—letting you join this dinner is already an affront to the air we breathe. You really think you deserve to order food?”

Her words cut deeper than I would have liked to admit. Relying on my looks? The thought was laughable. I woke up before dawn to draft proposals, spent long hours at construction sites, and the sun had tanned my skin to a shade that made my mother do a double-take. Yet here was this intern, dismissing my hard work as nothing but superficial charm.

I pushed my chair back with a loud scrape and stood tall, locking eyes with her. “Hey, watch your mouth. I earn my place here by working my ass off. Everyone in this room can see it. You are in no position to insult me.”

“This is a company dinner, not your personal affair. If I ‘don’t qualify’ to order, then you certainly don’t either. No wonder I caught a whiff of something foul when I walked in—it was your mouth spewing nonsense.”

A few of my coworkers stifled their laughter, clearly enjoying the spectacle. They had long since grown weary of Sadie’s entitled demeanor.

Just a month into her internship, and she had already made a name for herself by treating everyone as though they were beneath her. I recalled the incident with Meg Wheeler, the new employee who had dared to refuse Sadie’s coffee request. Sadie had retaliated by pouring a scalding cup over Meg’s head, an act that left the poor girl with blisters and no apology in sight.

“If you even think about making me apologize, I’ll ensure you’re fired!” Sadie had threatened, her voice dripping with malice, leaving a chilling atmosphere in her wake.

The company had ended up covering Meg’s medical expenses, and I had wanted to defend her, to stand up against this bully. But my colleagues had restrained me, their expressions warning me against it. Now, I understood why—they were all intimidated by this so-called “daughter of Wesley Modine.”

Sadie’s face flushed a deep crimson, and she jabbed a finger toward my nose, her fury palpable. “Bitch! Stop pretending to be tough! Without my dad, this company would have crumbled long ago. At this dinner, I call the shots. If I say you can’t order, then you can’t!”

Her words hung in the air, heavy with the weight of her arrogance. The waiter, caught in the crossfire, glanced nervously between us.

“Ma’am… should I still place the order?” he asked hesitantly.

“Yes,” I replied, my voice firm and unwavering.

Nothing else to warn about. Thanks for reading 😉💫

Chapter 86: 1989/07/07 New Colleague: Jeremy Fitzgerald

It has been three years since the bosses entered their “creative outburst” phase.

The old-timers are already used to betting on how long it takes for newcomers to discover the bosses’ relationship—and how their worldview shatters when they do…

But when Jeremy Fitzgerald arrives, he gives them a particularly surprising twist.

Jeremy is assigned to the technical department, though he originally applies for a security guard position.

Strangely, from the very start of his internship, Jeremy shows a curious familiarity with animatronics. He sometimes blurts out insights that usually come only from long-term exposure.

When HR asks about it, he stammers something about working at another mascot restaurant where the machines weren’t maintained properly, and the place shut down quickly.

This excuse obviously doesn’t hold water, so HR reports it to the bosses—Henry and William.

“What’s this employee’s full name, then?” William asks with feigned casualness, while Henry pretends to study other company documents, his expression stern.

“Jeremy Fitzgerald,” HR replies.

“Leave Mr. Fitzgerald’s file here. We’ll discuss it. You may go,” William says.

“Good work, sharp eye,” Henry adds with a smile, offering a word of praise.

Once HR leaves and closes the door, William turns off the office surveillance system. Henry, meanwhile, pours two cups of coffee for them both.

“So… the Bite of ’87 victim?” Henry asks, pulling out a hidden whiteboard marked with a timeline—events from their previous life.

“Yes. I intend to place him in the technical department, keep him close, and head off any leaks,” William says, flipping through Jeremy’s file and sipping his coffee.

“Leaks? Even if he talks, people will just think he’s crazy.” Henry chuckles, shaking his head. Then, changing the subject slightly: “As for technical skill… I doubt simply being chased by ghost children teaches you much.”

“Henry, we used to have entry-level staff help fix broken kit,” William says, sounding awkward.

“…Did we?” Henry replies, his voice tinged with embarrassment and faint surprise. Three years later, he’s forgotten much about how they treated staff in their past life—or rather, after losing his daughter back then, he stopped caring about such details.

“We did. Which means the lad probably has some basic mechanical skills. He’s worth cultivating,” William insists, turning to the HR observation notes and passing the file to Henry.

“You’re right. Put him in the technical department. I’ll inform HR about our decision.” Henry scans the papers briefly.

“Good. Then I’ll have Michael keep an eye on him—maybe get him talking. Young people speak the same language; we can simply say you asked him,” William says, refilling both their cups. He’s grown oddly considerate lately.

“I should talk to him myself. Your terrible ‘dad’ attribute only subtracts points, it doesn’t add them. I’ll be more convincing,” Henry retorts, sipping his coffee.

William sighs after a long drink. “You’re right. You handle Michael. I’ll deal with HR about Mr. Fitzgerald.”

⋅⸝⦙⨳⦙⸜⨗⟶⧗⩃⋆⧿𖤓⧾⋆⩃⧗⟵⨗⸝⦙⨳⦙⸜⋅

One day, while Michael is helping in the technical department as usual, Henry calls him into the office.

“What’s up?” Michael sits opposite Henry at his gesture.

“If you have time, I’d like you to keep an eye on Jeremy Fitzgerald—see if he has past-life memories. You’re closer in age, so you won’t scare him off.” Henry’s voice is soft, without any command behind it.

“…If he’s the Bite of ’87 bloke, I worked with him for a few days in the last life. He’s a decent one.” Michael’s tone is dry. For him to say that, the man must have been outstanding. “You could just ask him. He’s a terrible liar.”

“Are you sure you want him to face William?” Henry presses.

Michael sighs, rubbing his brow. “…Fine. I’ll help.”

︒⠄⦁◌°✰。◌⋆⠁∘︒︒⠄⦁◌°✰。◌⋆⠁∘︒

July 7th. Jeremy’s first day at work.

HR leads him into the office for introductions, then to the newcomers’ lounge. Inside waits a familiar figure.

Brown hair. Blue eyes like burning fire. Dark circles under his eyes, a world-weary scowl paired with strikingly fine features. A white shirt with the faint outline of a red undershirt beneath the sunlight streaming through the window. Blue jeans. Red sneakers.

“This is your senior mentor. Introduce yourselves—I’ll leave you to it,” HR says, excusing themselves and leaving the two in awkward silence.

“Nice to meet you. I’m Jeremy Fitzgerald. You can call me Remy,” Jeremy says brightly.

“All right, Remy. I’ll walk you through today’s work.” Michael accepts the nickname without protest—very unlike him.

Jeremy blinks, realizing after a moment that Michael is speaking to him. “Oh, right. What should I do…?”

“First off, training. Here’s the safety manual.” Michael tosses him the booklet, catching Jeremy’s surprise at the word “training.”

“What’s with the face? Do we look like some dodgy outfit that chucks you in without it?” Michael crosses his arms, one eyebrow raised.

“N-no, it’s just… I never got training at my past jobs. That’s all.” Jeremy’s stammer is unconvincing.

“Every job? Unlucky.” Michael isn’t fooled. This guy definitely remembers.

…

From then on, Jeremy’s cracks start showing everywhere.

When asked to crawl through a ventilation shaft, he accepts without confusion. When they enter the animatronics’ rest room, he freezes stiff at the sight of Chica.

When dismantling a machine, he works with practiced ease, hardly needing instruction.

When left alone, he mutters, “It’s supposed to be like this… no, wait… this isn’t the same…”

And above all—

“Michael, how do I do this?”

“Michael, I need help.”

“Mike, is this right?”

Michael never tells him his name. But in their last life, he once said: You can call me Mike.

…

At lunch, after buying food together at a convenience store, Michael finally asks, “Remy, I haven’t actually introduced myself. Name’s Michael Afton. How’d you know my name before I said it?”

Jeremy almost chokes, fumbling for an excuse. “Ah, your nametag… unless you prefer something else?”

“…Sharp eye. Mike’s fine,” Michael says evenly.

But it’s too late. The more Jeremy tries to cover, the more obvious it becomes.

By day’s end, Michael lays it all out:

“First—you didn’t question the ventilation crawl.

Second—you dismantled animatronics without guidance.

Third—you called me Mike.

Fourth—you’re shocked we have lunch breaks.

And fifth—most important—you clearly remember the bird biting into your skull.”

Jeremy pales. “…Who else remembers?”

“Anyone who died in the restaurant, we reckon.” Michael shrugs.

“That’s… cruel,” Jeremy murmurs. “I guess they need trauma therapy, same as me?”

“Exactly.” Michael slings his bag over his shoulder. “The bosses will know soon enough. Forget about packing it in.” He rolls his eyes and leaves Jeremy staring blankly at a water bottle.

…

That night, Michael comes home to find William and Henry at the dinner table.

“Well? How’d it go?” they ask in unison. Henry chuckles; William smothers a laugh.

“He remembers as well. Case closed.” Michael is exhausted.

“You won’t coax him a bit more? We could even put you in for a pay rise,” William frowns.

Henry shoots him a disapproving look.

Michael sighs. “If you like, pay me out of your own pocket. Otherwise Accounts will think I’m some nepotism case. I’ve no interest in being the parachuted boss’s son.” Not taking free money would be idiotic, he thinks, but he won’t trade away his comfort for it.

“Deal,” William says instantly.

“Deal,” Michael mutters, flipping him the finger before heading to his room.

Henry rubs his forehead. “Fine. We’ll leave it for now. Once Jeremy stabilizes, we’ll approach him ourselves.”

“Agreed,” William nods.

…

Meanwhile, Jeremy wanders the streets, forcing himself to act normal—helping old folks cross, returning a ball to children—before going home.

At dinner, he cheerfully tells his family small happy stories from the day, as though he hadn’t been rattled at work.

He washes his own dish, changes clothes, showers, and finally lies in bed staring at the ceiling for three hours.

“…So it wasn’t a dream after all.”

And then, relieved beyond words, he cries.",4,1764774797.0,GachaFnaf,1,1.0,False

The thing is, the “digital coffee chat” finally happened just this earlier. I genuinely don’t know what it was supposed to be. I woke up early, made myself look semi-human, rehearsed my answers for potential job interview questions only for the entire thing to feel like two strangers accidentally joined the same Teams meeting.

He opens the call with a good morning and telling me his curiosity on how we, Fil-Ams, balance culture and work ethic. I'm ????? but the whole time I was politely replying hoping we could get straight to the point. Then we spent a good 15 minutes talking about his trips to Asia, his favorite beaches, and why he thinks remote work is the future. I kept waiting for him to pivot into talking about the role but he never did.

He asked about my projects but without actually asking. Like he asked what young developers enjoy building these days but not what I build or my experience. It was just purely vibes. I told him my hobbies, what I do, why I chose tech, and my passion in tech. And when I finally tried to talk about my tech stack, he only nodded, muttered words like ""interesting"" and ""sounds great"" and then told me about his favorite productivity app. After 40 minutes he wrapped it up saying we should stay connected because he liked my energy. No next steps, no mention of a role, no saying whether HR will follow up.

I left the call feeling like I’d just wasted the only 8AM wakeup I have done in months. I don’t know if I accidentally joined a networking event, a casual chat, or a man who was just bored on a Wednesday morning.

They don’t have flashy personalities or loud energy, but they radiate something stronger. This quiet charm isn’t magic. It’s the overlooked strength of introverts.

In a world obsessed with extroversionTikTok rants, influencer ""alpha male"" content, and endless networking adviceintroverts are often misunderstood. Some even feel like they need to “fix” their personality to fit in. That’s BS. So many of my peers in creative roles, leadership, and tech are deeply introvertedand thriving because of it. Not despite it.

This post breaks down why introverts are secretly the hottest people in the room (yes, even if they’re standing in the corner). It’s not puff-up-your-ego content. Everything here is researched from legit books, psych studies, and interviews with real experts. No fluff. Let’s finally give introverts the spotlight they’ve earned.

Presence over performance.  

Introverts often have this quiet intensity that makes people lean in. Dr. Laurie Helgoe, author of “Introvert Power,” writes that extroverts speak to think, while introverts think to speak. That pause? It creates gravity. In conversations, their words carry more weight because they're intentional. Harvard psychologist Susan Cain (whose 2012 TED Talk surpassed 40M views) calls this “the power of quiet.” People instinctively trust those who don’t need to dominate a room to feel confident.

Deep listening = emotional magnetism.  

Research from the Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley shows that being deeply listened to activates the same brain regions as being rewarded. Introverts naturally listen more than they talk. When someone feels truly heard, they feel safeand attracted. It's why introverts often become trusted friends, confidants, and... yes, romantic partners people obsess over. Listening is seductive, and few do it well.

Mystery creates desire.  

Ever heard that phrase “leave them wanting more?” That's the introvert's whole vibe. A 2014 study from the University of Virginia published in Psychological Science found that people are more intrigued by potential romantic partners when there’s a sense of ambiguity. When someone doesn’t immediately reveal everything, it creates curiosity. Introverts master this without even trying.

They’re self-contained, not self-centered.  

Confidence without noise. Introverts often project independence, stability, and calm. They don’t need constant validation. This self-possession is hot. Psychiatrist Carl Jung called introversion the source of internal energymeaning introverts recharge alone and bring that grounded energy into relationships. That energy translates into being low-drama, emotionally mature, and self-sufficient. Major green flags.

Their interests go deep, not wide.  

Introverts often obsess over specific fieldsart, philosophy, indie film, design, coding, history, literature. And people who care passionately about ideas are naturally attractive. Like, isn’t it 100x more interesting when someone would rather talk about the psychology of dreams than gossip about coworkers? They tend to have rich inner lives, which makes their worldview more layered and textured. It’s what Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (who coined the term “flow”) refers to as “deep complexity”one of the traits that makes a person deeply compelling.

Emotional safety is sexy.  

According to attachment theory researchers like Dr. Sue Johnson, people seek out partners who offer a secure emotional base. Introverts are less likely to use performative behaviors, love bombing, or erratic attention cycles. Their emotional steadiness can be incredibly attractive for those seeking long-term closeness. They might not say “I love you” every five minutes, but they show it consistentlyand quietly.

They're not trying to be likedso they are.  

Ever notice how someone becomes instantly cooler when they’re not trying to impress anyone? That’s the introvert effect. The Journal of Personality published a 2020 study finding that people tend to trust and respect individuals who regulate their emotional expressions. Translation? People who don't overshare or overperform tend to be seen as more emotionally intelligent and charismatic over time. Introverts radiate controlled energyand that’s rare.

They cultivate real intimacy, not surface-level shtick.  

In a culture of swipe-rights and brunch small talk, deep connection is rare. Introverts prefer meaningful one-on-one conversations. They’re not trying to meet everyone, just to truly know someone. That intimacy builds slowlywhich makes the bonds stronger. As psychotherapist Esther Perel often says, “Eroticism thrives in the space between.” That space is built into how introverts relate.

Now if you’re an introvert who’s tired of being told to “just be more social,” you don’t need to change who you are. But you can amplify your strengths.

One of the best books ever written on this subject is “Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking” by Susan Cain. New York Times Bestseller. Over 2 million copies sold. It’s the introvert manifesto. Cain dives into how society undervalues quiet people, and how introverts actually thrive in leadership, creativity, and relationships. I honestly wish every extrovert read this book just to understand us better. This book will make you question everything you think you knew about charisma.

Another insanely good read is “Solitude” by Michael Harris, winner of the Governor General's Literary Award. It explores our anxious relationship with aloneness and shows how time with ourselves sharpens our perception, confidence, and sense of self. This is the book for anyone who’s ever felt like the world moves too fast to catch your breath. It helped me understand that choosing space doesn’t mean you're lonelyit means you’re tuned in.



For apps that support introvert well-being, try Endel. This app blends neuroscience-backed soundscapes with ambient music to help you focus, sleep, or recharge. Designed to respond to your circadian rhythm, weather, and heart rate, it’s basically a calming shield for overstimulated brains. A godsend if open offices, crowded trains, or chaotic cities leave you drained.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns expert interviews, top book insights, and research papers into personalized audio lessons. Built by a team of Columbia alumni and ex-Google AI engineers, it’s like Duolingo meets MasterClassbut with a smart avatar named Freedia that adapts to your mood and learning style. You can choose the tone, narrator’s voice, and depth (I usually go for the 40-min deep-dives with real-world examples). I use it to explore topics like emotional intelligence, social psychology, and creativityall tailored to my introspective brain. I’ve been replacing social media scrolls with BeFreed sessions and feel less foggy, more articulate, and way more mentally sharp.

Also check out ASH: Journal for Self-Inquiry. It’s a beautifully designed journaling app rooted in therapy-based prompts, built specifically for deep, quiet thinkers. Not your average morning routine planner. It asks real questions about who you are and what mattersand guides you gently through your own thought process. Probably one of the most emotionally intelligent tools on the App Store right now.

For podcasts, “On Being” with Krista Tippett is a must-listen. Her conversations with philosophers, scientists, and artists go deep into what it means to be human. No fluff. Just soul-level dialogue. Imagine getting coffee with the wisest person you know, once a week. That’s the vibe.

And if you're more of a visual learner, search for Nathaniel Drew on YouTube. His videos explore mental clarity, digital minimalism, and the strengths of being introspective in a hyper-connected world. No toxic hustle culture content either. Just real talk, clean visuals, and thoughtful self-discovery.

If you identify as introverted, your quietness is not a flaw. It’s a form of presence. A quiet storm. Magnetic in its own way. And this world desperately needs more of that energy.",3,1764774692.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False

Dead silent, just laptop glow and regret. Our professor clearly got sick of it and decided to try a ""fun participation activity"".

In theory, ok, academic speed networking . In practice, half the class had not done the reading and the other half has social anxiety. So the first round starts and instead of ""what did you think of Chapter 3"" I hear people saying  ""uh what is your major"" and ""where did you get that coffee"". One guy panics and just blurts  out ""hi I am bad at eye contact"" then stares at the wall while the girl in front of him tries not  to laugh. Every 45 seconds the professor yells ""rotate"" like an over excited party host and it  gets louder and louder in the room.   
The absolute best part. After like ten  rotations, one of my friends whispers to me that she has just accidentally given her number  to a guy because she thought he was asking about the textbook page. Another pair ended  up ranting about their shared hatred of group projects instead of the assigned article and  they walked out together still talking.

It was the night of the company dinner, an occasion that everyone had been eagerly anticipating. Each employee was given the chance to select a dish from the menu, a small luxury amidst the daily grind of deadlines and meetings.

As I sat at the table, savoring the moment, the new intern, Sadie, abruptly seized the menu from my grasp. Her sudden action caught me off guard.

“The dishes are enough. No more ordering,” she declared with an air of authority that was utterly unwarranted.

I chose to ignore her brazen behavior, turning my attention to the waiter who stood patiently by my side. “I’ll have one Mac and cheese, please,” I said, my voice steady, determined to assert my choice.

But before I could even register my order, Sadie slammed the menu against my face, her eyes blazing with indignation.

“When I say you can’t order, you can’t order! Who do you think you are?” she spat, her tone laden with condescension.

The sharp edge of the menu grazed my cheek, leaving a stinging sensation that ignited a fire within me. My temper flared, and without thinking, I snatched the menu back and returned it to her face with a forceful smack. She let out a shriek of surprise, her bravado faltering for just a moment.

“Do you have any idea who I am? My father is Wesley Modine—the most significant client this company has!” she shouted, her voice rising with each word.

“Even the CEO treats me with respect. You dare to lay a hand on me? Believe me, I can have your sales title revoked and ensure the entire industry blacklists you!”

I froze, momentarily stunned by her words. Wesley Modine was not just a name to me; he was my biological uncle. The realization hit me like a wave crashing against the shore.

He was forty years old, perpetually single, and now I was faced with this revelation: since when did he have a daughter old enough to be in a position of power?

Sadie’s smug expression grew even more pronounced as she noticed my silence. “What, scared now? A gold-digger like you, relying solely on your looks to get sales—letting you join this dinner is already an affront to the air we breathe. You really think you deserve to order food?”

Her words cut deeper than I would have liked to admit. Relying on my looks? The thought was laughable. I woke up before dawn to draft proposals, spent long hours at construction sites, and the sun had tanned my skin to a shade that made my mother do a double-take. Yet here was this intern, dismissing my hard work as nothing but superficial charm.

I pushed my chair back with a loud scrape and stood tall, locking eyes with her. “Hey, watch your mouth. I earn my place here by working my ass off. Everyone in this room can see it. You are in no position to insult me.”

“This is a company dinner, not your personal affair. If I ‘don’t qualify’ to order, then you certainly don’t either. No wonder I caught a whiff of something foul when I walked in—it was your mouth spewing nonsense.”

A few of my coworkers stifled their laughter, clearly enjoying the spectacle. They had long since grown weary of Sadie’s entitled demeanor.

Just a month into her internship, and she had already made a name for herself by treating everyone as though they were beneath her. I recalled the incident with Meg Wheeler, the new employee who had dared to refuse Sadie’s coffee request. Sadie had retaliated by pouring a scalding cup over Meg’s head, an act that left the poor girl with blisters and no apology in sight.

“If you even think about making me apologize, I’ll ensure you’re fired!” Sadie had threatened, her voice dripping with malice, leaving a chilling atmosphere in her wake.

The company had ended up covering Meg’s medical expenses, and I had wanted to defend her, to stand up against this bully. But my colleagues had restrained me, their expressions warning me against it. Now, I understood why—they were all intimidated by this so-called “daughter of Wesley Modine.”

Sadie’s face flushed a deep crimson, and she jabbed a finger toward my nose, her fury palpable. “Bitch! Stop pretending to be tough! Without my dad, this company would have crumbled long ago. At this dinner, I call the shots. If I say you can’t order, then you can’t!”

Her words hung in the air, heavy with the weight of her arrogance. The waiter, caught in the crossfire, glanced nervously between us.

“Ma’am… should I still place the order?” he asked hesitantly.

“Yes,” I replied, my voice firm and unwavering.

1pd6pkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pd6pkz/aitah_and_did_i_cross_a_line/,AITAH and did I cross a line?,"Buckle in its a long one. I (32f) am married and have been with my husband (46m) for 10 years now. My husband has 3 children before me and 2 with me. This is about his 2nd 3rd and my 1st, we'll call them Vf14, Tm12, and Af5. 

My background growing up, both my parents worked and did not spend very much time with us and were very accusatory and getting whooped was often for the smallest of things. I didn't want to be that kind of parent.

When me and Hubby got together is when I met his oldest whom Hubbys mom had custody of and V and T whom their mother had custody of, We'll call her R.

R relied solely on child support, had no job, horded, and her house was infested with roaches as well as having cats that peed and pooed outside the box. She spanked and threw stuff and even slapped V in the face for not doing laundry. When V turned 12 we got custody of both of them.

Now T has ADHD, diagnosed at 5 and has doubled his dose since 7 and at 11 we got him off for a med that is not a controlled substance. He takes anxiety meds also and has a therapist once a week to work on his anger issues. When he gets into it with V he has no limit to what hurtful things to say and he will make it personal. And the arguments are not justified, V will have mentioned something small like don't forget homework or grab your trash you left and he goes off. Now don't get me wrong V will come off as higher than thou due mostly because their mom made her watch him. But I call it out as I see it.

T though will be mean at the smallest thing and we've been trying to talk it out with him but he gets defensive into a point it turns into a tantrum. He will swear up and down he's telling the truth when I have receipts from school video feeds, multiple people saying the same thing, or I've witness it myself. He has no accountability whatsoever. And when he has pushed himself into a corner he lashes out by slamming doors, hitting stuff, throwing stuff. He's broken pictures off the wall from slamming doors, he broke toys and controlles and phones. We have talked but nothing changes with him.

I just have birth to my youngest at the beginning of this year and started doling out chores that I usually do to the kids. They switch trash and dishes every other day so V will do dishes and T trash one day and the next they switch. I had to constantly be on them to do it.  T was mad and told A that her mother doesn't know how to do dishes and it bullisht. Of course I heard and then A came and told me what he said. I called him out and he didn't apologize instead he asks why I can't do it. I explain that I've got a lot on my plate, with appointments, taking care of baby and then, food, bills, groceries, their extra curricular. I need help and he can pull his was weight.

Recently Hubby got a new job and it was a flop, we dug a hole it was pretty deep, we had to ask different family members for help to keep bills good. We explained to the kids we will be getting bare minimum, only necessities, and off brand. Both V and T get paid $10 for each A and $5 for every B on their report card from their grandparents. And they're both AB kids. So every now and then I will treat A to a candy or hot chocolate from coffee shop or a small toy maybe once a week. I try to make it fair as fair can be. T called me out for wasting money on A why can't i get him stuff or give him allowance. I explained that her participation in school she does not get rewarded for. She messes up sometimes and we work on it at home and when I get a note that she did amazing or better on a listening, or doing her work, I will reward her just as he gets rewarded. I explain my decisions and the reasons I do things.

He has bullied every one of us and the only way we can punish him is if we take all electronics away, phone TV ps5 etc. He will sit there and bang on the wall non stop. BTW we live in a mobile home so walks are thin and his is the living room wall. If we tell him to do something he will defiantly say no. And his dad has chewed him out so many times. We are at the point where he can go back and live with his mom and I hate that I say that but we are at our wits end. The way he treats A then turns around and complains that she's being mean but she learns it FROM HIM. He gets mad that I don't punish her like I do him and it's cause she's 5 YEARS OLD NOT 12! And now he accuses me of favoritism. 

Cut to yesterday as I picked them up from school. 
A asked to decorate the Christmas tree.
I said yes
T said why can't we wait for Hubby
I said he's working late, we never know if he'll be home when they're home let alone awake so Hubby said to go ahead and get it done.
We get home T and V go to their rooms and A is ready now. So I ask if T and V wanted to decorate
V says ya and T, almost panicky, right now?! We just got home!
I said yeh A is ready so why not?
T - So A gets to make all the decisions now? 
Me- no cause if she were she would've done it by herself last night while yall were at your basketball games.
T- why can't we wait?
Me-when do you wanna do it?
T-idk when are you making dinner?
Me- I would rather you give me a time (so I can keep an eye on them and not be distracted by baby and cooking)
He said 5, which is an hour. Cool I tell everyone 5, and everyone grabs something to snack on.
5 comes around they start decorating everything is chill.
V gets onto T for something that was unnecessary like about the stepstool blocking A. I called her out but T stompes off to his room and slammed the door.

V is done now and goes for a walk with her friend.
T is done and asks where she is I check life 360 and she's walking main street about 5 blocks from the park so he said he was going to the park (BTW you can walk anywhere in our town within 15 minutes) 

I'm finishing dinner and T is home and tells me that V and T got into an argument about who was at the park first and V kept telling him to leave (another note there's 2 parks, a city one and a school one). She made a comment to him that if she admits she's lying would he leave and he said no.
I told him next time they get into it have her call me. Don't say anything else don't respond to her just tell her to call me.

The rest of the night goes off, I call V to come back to finish her laundry at 8 and her friend to leave by 9.

9 rolls around I'm in bed with A and baby on the boob when I hear shouting. As I'm trying to disengage with baby and roll out like a ninja the door slams and loud.

I come out V is in the kitchen I ask her what happened,  T came out and I told him to go to his room and I will get his side in a minute. Which is what I've always done I get one side then the other the I confront them together.  They are never to talk to the other only to me and are not to say anything while it's the others turn. He started to fit and as V was giving me her side he keeps interrupting. So I yell for him to cut it out. Anyways

V said T came into her room without knocking, called her a bum, wouldn't get out, and wouldn't shut the door when he left.
T said the door was already opened, he pushed the door open and told V to throw her trash away she started yelling to get out and to close the door but the door was open she just didn't want to close it herself.
Then V mentioned the park and all hell broke loose. She mentioned him cussing. Which honestly I believe because he cusses at home,  on the phone, at school,with friends. He will not stop.  He got mad and started punching his bed and floor I said when I don't hear you cussing anymore then I'll believe it. He said we'll he's sorry he's not perfect like V.
I said V is not perfect and I call her out when need be.
But if he wants the privileges we give her then he needs to start acting right starting with these tantrums,lying, vapes, egging on strangers, getting in strangers cars are nothing he hasnt done before so its really hard to put trust in that.
It turned into a whole spiel about them both being pretty damn privileged while their dad works his ass off in the Texas heat and windy cold to give them what the want on top of what they need yet they can't help with chores let alone get along with each other.
T-why can't YOU'RE child do chores then, why is she so special? 
She is 5 Years old! Her responsibilities are to clean up after herself, work on sight words, and read a book. She can't take trash out, she'll help ME when I do dishes and she'll help ME sweep and mop. And she will continue to do that until she is bigger than the trash to take it out and is able to put dishes up easily without help.

At this point I am yelling and my adrenaline is running high due to the sheer audacity of this boy and I have had enough.

I continue if he continues to punch stuff and breaks something I'm punching his lights out.

He said I can't cause he's a child. I said I would do anything to protect the integrity of my house and though yes I would not punch him but I most definitely will put that paddle across his ass. I told him to go take a shower cool off and I walked off.

No he continued to punch stomp and throw stuff including his phone. I told him to go take a shower he told me no.
I said I'm done with him not listening and disrespecting me and treating me as a maid/taxi/and the chick his dad knocked up so either he gets up with his own volition or I will give him equal treatment as my 5 year old and I will put him in the shower. 
I said I give him to 3
1
. . .
2
. . .
3 
 . . .
I walk to the bathroom turn the shower on and I came back hugged him and picked him up and take him to the bathroom. He struggled but it was only a minute to stand him in the shower, clothes on and everything. 

When they say you see red from being so angry they are not lying. 

I walked off and he's kicking and screaming in the tub. I called my husband and told him what happened and what I did. I felt awful but also justified. We have mentioned so many times recently that we honestly would not mind him going back to his mom's.

1pd6o0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastCaretaker/comments/1pd6o0j/my_experiences_and_wishes_after_9_launches_144/,"My experiences and wishes after 9 launches, 144 hours and 506 kms later.","Hello there fellow caretakers!

  
Let me start with that I LOVE, THIS, GAME! It really hit a spot for me. The theme, the atmosphere, the music are all really close to my kind of sci-fi. Finally a survival game that get's it. What could be a better theme for survival than the extinction and resurrection of humanity?! 

I also love the community which was built around the game. Therefore I'd like to share my experiences, the things that annoy me and even though I have put a lot of hours into the game I hope I can get some feedback on the things I might misunderstood or currently doing wrong. I'll try to focus on the things I haven't seen anywhere mentioned so far. 

  
\- I wish it would be visible somehow the latest drop pod after the succesfull launch. At this point I can't remember which out of the 9 different pods is the latest one to check. When I check it on the map it says new for every one of them but that is not the truth. There is only one after each launch (according to my knlowledge) and I hate to go through each of them to figure out which one has the latest stash in it. This has to do something with the field of view (or view distance). Hope they will fix this. 

\- The stash in the drop pods. I wish there would be more memories and less coffee seeds and entanglment lens/quantum duplicators. I really feel like at the current state of the game these are pretty useless (especially the coffee seeds - I don't know what's the point of it and I have like 15 seeds stashed in my boxes). The reason why I'm also mentioning this that I have been to every single POIs in the game, 3 times already. I'm 99% sure I have found every single memory which were above the water level. Below see level I have checked everything until 100-115 meters. Ofc there can be some things I have missed but these must be very few. 

\- Human creation and Food items. First of all I have wasted a lot of resources in the beginning because I wasn't paying attention on the traits of the humans. My first human was like 70 cms and 50kgs and have the memories enough for 6 humans and ended up ""just"" as a maintenance engineer. Related to this I have created several humans without any traits. I really wish there would be a warning in the game during the creation process which warns me that based on the provided memories and food items this human will end up without any traits. Would you like to still proceed?! At that point I was like ok I'll still send them up since we are saving humanity. The more the better I guess. Again this is just my gut feeling there is no proof that this will be the case later on the game. Really curious how this will affect the dynamic of the game and humanity :) Haven't seen anything on the road map related to this and I'd like to have some updates on this as well. 

\- How do we know the gender of the newly created human? Will it matter and visible later on? 

\- Also related to the food creation process I wish the light pink slimes and other enemies would respawn more often (or at all) especially when you completely swipe them out at the POIs then they don't respwan anymore.  The light and the dark slimes are the ones which provide light (vitamin D) and the dark bio material (calcium) which then later on is important for the muscle and bone fortification process. Without that you can still produce humans but for the ""fine"" tuning during the creation process I think these are mandatory. At least for me. Therefore I'd love if they would respawn more often. At this point I killed all of these enemies and I'm left without any light material for example. 

\- Why is that some guitars are lootable and some guitars are not ? There are also items which are lootable and don't give any memory points for example the bowling balls and basket balls. I think this doesn't make sense. I see at some point there will be a basketball minigame (therefore the balls around) but it would make sense if they would give these items some points as well. 

\- Performance issues. Around the seed vaults the game laggs pretty hard until I either reach my pressure point or if it's below my pressure point then it usually lasts until 50 meters. 

\- Loved the central warehouse station but it was disappointing that I could not get into it.  Hopefully it will be the part of the new patch (""the secret of the warehouse""). 

\- Regarding the enhancer points. Hopefully later in the game we can get higher than level 25 and will be able to fill out the remaining/missing points of your abilities. I'm lucky cus I was only putting numbers when it was really necessary and kept some points for later in the game but as I heard there were some players who for example thought that pressure points are dumb and they ignored them. Now they are stuck and basically can't do anything below sea level. In order to avoid this it would be great if we could reshuffle our points anytime throughout the game. 

Regarding the bugs - I would not mention too much as the community and the developers are on top of it I think. One thing which I noticed in the game but haven't seen anywhere is that (and it's really just a minor thing) when you come up from the ocean to the boat (on the ladder) if you equipped something then the robot's arms remain the same way and the tool just disappears.

\- Since I'm playing this game all ""alone"" for this many ours I started not to scrap my fellow caretaker robots but rather stashing them in a pile on my boat. Would be cool if they would restart at some point (which I know that goes against the theme of the game as you are the ""last caretaker""). It would be still cool though if we would get some smaller robots which are helping throughout the scrapping and other smaller but time consuming processes.

Would be also curious on how many launches you guys had and how many hours, kilometers did you guys put into the game? What are your favourite memories?

One of my favourite memories of the game was when I pressed an elevator to come down and while I was casually waiting for it to arrive, it brought down a ""small unexpected present"" from the top which was a roller boi which then came alive and started to shoot at me. I don't remember which habitat was it and if it was intentional or not but it was really cool and surprising. Cought me off guard for sure. Hope we will have a few suprises like this in the future. 

Fun fact - It was after around 100 hours into the game when I noticed that there is an eye at the backup station which follows you around :D Did you guys notice that ? 

Stay safe caretakers -We are the last hope for humanity! Stay vigilant, keep the lights on as the world needs us!

PS. I really hope that the humans don’t come back to Earth as I’ve already scrapped every chair and mattress — there won’t be anywhere left for them to sit or sleep for sure :D

1pd6nk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1pd6nk8/those_with_similar_symptoms_or_concerns/,Those With Similar Symptoms or Concerns,"Those With Similar Symptoms or Concerns 

I sent this post to many others with similar symptoms or concerns and wanted to share what has worked for me.

Gastritis can either be short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic), and both are typically diagnosed as mild, moderate, or severe. Gastritis is further classified as active or inactive and erosive or non-erorsive. Sometimes the inflammation or diagnosis can also indicate the degree of symptoms. Whether it's acute or chronic and whatever the cause, most types of gastritis have shared similar symptoms and treatment protocols. Most people will heal or achieve remission with time and doing a good treatment plan. After healing, there may also be some mild lingering symptoms or occasional flare-ups that require long-term management and lifestyle changes.

I developed mild chronic gastritis and duodenitis that hit me hard in May 2022. Even though my symptoms started in May, looking back, I did have some occasional mild symptoms the year prior that would come and go, and I just never connected the dots. My digestive inflammation also affected the first part of the small intestine connected to the stomach (duodenum), and that often creates discomfort in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal area. My symptoms were cramping pain, back pain, weight loss, minimal appetite, feeling full without eating much, bloating, loose or discolored stools, fatigue, and occasional right upper quadrant discomfort, day after day and week after week. I also developed silent acid reflux that caused metallic or bad taste, hacking, and white mucus phlegm. 

My gastrointestinal tests of bloodwork, abdominal ultrasound, hida scan, cat scan, and colonoscopy were all normal except for my endoscopy. My endoscopy test showed mild chronic inflammation, and the biopsies were negative for H.pylori, celiac, bile reflux, atrophic, or any other cause. There were times I thought my condition was hopeless or some serious medical condition, and it also created a lot of uncertainty and frustration. 

I've also had a similar unknown gastrointestinal condition for over 25 years that would happen every few years. Those symptoms were usually mild and resolved after a couple of weeks. Tests were always negative. It may have been an ongoing digestive condition or a ticking time bomb that finally resulted in chronic gastritis. I also have a small sliding hiatal-hernia, but those are very common and usually no big deal. My current gastrointestinal condition was most likely a result of stress, coffee on an empty stomach, eating large meals late at night, spicy food, and other lifestyle factors. Sound familiar??

There is hope...

My gastric treatment plan and success path consisted of doing diet adjustments, lifestyle changes, psyllium, acid control medication, supplements, and probiotics. An extremely important and key step for healing my digestive condition was protecting the stomach lining with either psyllium or slippery elm and also reducing stomach acid with PPIs or h2 blockers. My preference was doing psyllium (Konsyl) and famotidine (Pepcid) h2 blockers. There is NO quick fix or a perfect solution, and a one-size fits all treatment plan. Do not rush the healing process. If I had to rank the order of importance for treatment and management:

1. Anti-inflammatory Diet
2. Lifestyle Changes 
3. Psyllium or Slippery Elm 
4. H2 Blockers or PPI's 
5. Supplements
6. Probiotics 

Gastrointestinal conditions and disorders can be complicated or mysterious, stubborn, and often require many different types of treatment methods. Sometimes, diet and lifestyle changes are not enough for healing, and additional measures are required, such as acid control medication, supplements, and probiotics. Acid control medication really helps to alleviate pain or irritation, prevents further or ongoing gastrointestinal damage, and significantly aids the healing process. H2 blockers are typically for mild to moderate symptoms, reduce stomach acid, about 50% percent, are more gentle on the digestive system, and have fewer side effects. PPIs are very aggressive and block stomach acid up to 90% percent, and are usually more for moderate to severe symptoms. PPIs also have more side effects, causing digestive irritation and from long-term use, such as acid rebound or low stomach acid. Most people with uncomplicated gastrointestinal conditions usually only require H2 blockers and do very well. It often comes down to the specific diagnosis, symptoms, or what works best. Sometimes, it's just trial & error.

Psyllium is a proven natural therapy used for treating gastritis or other digestive issues and is well known in the gastrointestinal community. Many doctors or health specialists prescribe psyllium as part of a treatment plan and also for long-term management. Psyllium powder is especially effective for coating and protecting the digestive lining and helping to promote healing inflammation. 

During my healing phase, I usually did one teaspoon of psyllium powder with eight ounces of water twice a day - mid-morning after breakfast and late evening after dinner. At the beginning of my digestive inflammation onset or when my symptoms were really difficult, I did psyllium before breakfast, lunch, and dinner on an empty stomach for several weeks. This really helped boost the healing process, protect the digestive lining tract and ease symptoms. Once my digestive issues improved, I reduced doing psyllium to once a day, late-evening after dinner or before bed, for digestive maintenance and long-term management. Many people typically start with doing only 1/2 or 1/4 teaspoon of psyllium for several days and gradually increase their fiber intake. Some people may only require doing a smaller dose of psyllium and can get the same results without having a need to increase.

After many months (one full year) and doing a good treatment plan, I have finally healed from mild chronic gastritis and duodenitis. I am again eating or drinking without any restrictions. My focus now is long-term management and flare-up prevention with diet adjustments, lifestyle changes, and psyllium once a day. H2 blockers and supplements are only as needed. I may not ever be 100% percent completely symptom free, but I feel normal again, and to me, that's the same as being cured. Because the digestive mucosal lining has been weakened or compromised from chronic inflammation, I also expect there will always be some mild lingering symptoms or occasional flare-ups. Knowing how to manage digestive inflammation will now make it very reassuring to avoid any uncertainty of healing and anxiety. 

The bottom line and, in my opinion, protect your stomach lining and digestive tract. Doing this key step along with diet and lifestyle changes will greatly help the healing process and bowel management. For me, psyllium was the magic protecting the stomach lining, healing inflammation, and restoring functional bowel processing. I have healed, so can you...

Do use the Gastritis Healing Book and the Quickstart Guide located at the top page inside our group. Absolute must do!! When you have time, also check out my published posts located in my gastritis group profile. They can all be very useful for increasing healing knowledge and maintaining symptom awareness. Reminder: What works for me may not work for you.

Finally, I'm not a doctor or therapist, but just someone with a lot of knowledge and personal experiences. Always discuss with a doctor or health specialist your condition and treatment options - especially diet, lifestyle, medication, supplements, probiotics, and the benefits of psyllium. Remember, minimum healing time for improvements is three months, but realistically, it's more like 4 - 12 months and sometimes longer. There may also always be some ongoing lingering symptoms or occasional flare-ups. Just stay positive, keep focused, and never give up.",2,1764774412.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

Got above freezing and started raining. I might be experiencing a little ptsd from last year. I'm making the most of it though. Been keeping my campfire going and a pot of perked coffee on. 



Went on a little hike with some friends last weekend (pic 17 was the only picture I took of that). 1.7 miles in to a nice hilltop, jetboiled some mountain house and came back. 3.33 miles total. Super spontaneous. Super basic trip. The tAKticals performed beautifully. Even fell in some water on the way up (moose punched a whole through some ice on the edge of a swamp). Temps were in the mid twenties and I was perfectly comfortable. Definitely wanna do that again sometime soon.

  
Gave the OG tankers some much needed tlc and wore them a bit just because. What a phenominal pair of boots! I love how wrinkled with age they are, yet still standing strong.

Then after two seconds, he pulled away. And i was like “oh my god im sorry. You dont like it?” Then he was like nervously laughing and said no im sorry. So that was really an awkward 5minutes. Then he said “maybe I should go”.. so i said okay. But is it me? I mean he’s very sexual in message and i think he likes me physically because we were so good when we talked outside and ate. Then he said sorry about it. I asked “you dont find me attractive?” Then he nervously saying uhmm maybe? I have another type. And i said oh okay sorry if i kissed you. You may go now. I didnt walk him out. I said i feel embarassed and yeah. 

What do you think? Damnnnnn. Never ever this happened to me until now. I really felt embarassed like wtf. He seemed so genuinely interested to me. He also mentioned saying maybe we can be friends or soemthing. The fuck hahaha

Edit: then he said.. uhmm see you later? I said while smiling “what?? I feel so embarassed rigjt now and i dont think ill see you again.” I told him, it’s not his fault for sure and I apologized if I violated him by kissing him.

I’m doing it because Ive had issues with brain fog, sudden food intolerances in the last several years, and my hormones are extremely out of whack (pmdd, newly developed resistance to testosterone treatment).
So I’m really motivated to make this work. 
But. My energy levels are almost nonexistent. My mood is very low. My lower back is killing me and I’m pretty certain it’s due to the fast because it started when Ketosis kicked in and I haven’t slept weird or done anything strenuous. It’s also cold and I’m very intolerant of the cold anyway but of course the weight loss and lack of metabolic activity makes it worse. 
The reason I decided now was the time is , first, I’ve been wanting to for a while already, 2nd, I currently don’t have a demanding job, 3rd, my dependents are staying with a family member for a while, and 4th, im so broke I literally can’t afford food anyway.

An elegant, middle-aged woman in a perfectly tailored business suit froze in the doorway. “I—I’m so sorry, Ms. Lane. I ordered the presents two weeks ago to make sure your sister gets them before Christmas. I’ve been calling the delivery service since yesterday morning; they assured me it would arrive by lunch time at the latest—”

Emma cut her off with a flick of her hand. “Just sort it out.”

“I will—I’ll get right to it. Before I go… Terry Mitchell from The Sterling Crest Resorts requested a meeting today to discuss the offer. I tried to explain that the Sales VP handles those offers, but he insisted on meeting with you personally—”

“Terry Mitchell?” Emma’s eyes narrowed, the name clearly registering. “It’s fine, Marta. Schedule it for late afternoon.”

Marta hesitated. “But… you’ve got your sister’s dinner tonight? I thought you were trying to make an early escape.”

A dismissive wave of Emma’s hand stopped her short. “I’ll manage. Set it up.”

“I will.”

Before Marta could move, Emma added, “Have you got the campaign early numbers for me?”

“I was just about to go to Marketing—”

“Forget it. Focus on the delivery of those damn presents. I’ll get the numbers myself.”

Marta nodded quickly and slipped out, closing the door behind her.

Emma let out a slow, controlled breath. She walked to the immense, floor-to-ceiling window that dominated the far wall. Twenty stories below, the city was a blur of frantic, holiday-red energy, last hours of Christmas rush.

She watched the tiny figures dashing across streets, weighed down by shopping bags, making final arrangements for dinners, carrying armloads of last-minute gifts, clutching flowers.

Then her eyes drifted upward, catching the giant billboard across the street, their latest and most successful campaign, showcasing a lavish, beautifully lit bouquet and the glowing slogan,

“Bring your loved ones joy for Christmas.”

A faint, cold smile touched her lips. She priced that joy.

She took a moment to admire the view, then pulled out her cell and quickly typed a message to her sister: “Presents on their way. I am running late. Will update.” She slid the device back into her pocket and turned back toward her desk. Picking up the office phone, she dialed Marketing. No answer. She tried again. Nothing.

Her jaw tightened. “What the hell is happening in this company today?” she muttered, slamming the phone down.

She stormed out of her office, swept past Marta, who sat behind her desk, clutching the phone with both hands and spelling out a delivery tracking number.

Emma stabbed the elevator button. When the doors slid shut behind her with a metallic clack, she crossed her arms and stared at the display showing the changing floor numbers.

As the car descended toward the Marketing floor, a noise began to filter: music, loud and slightly tinny. The closer the elevator drew to its destination, the more volume surged into the small cabin. Jingle Bell Rock. By the time the elevator reached twelfth, the song was pounding through the walls.

DING. 

The doors opened and Emma stepped out into chaos. She froze.

The entire Marketing floor was clustered around a single central desk. Perched on top of it was a young man, back to the elevator, singing into a stapler, a wildly energetic, off-key Christmas carol. The melody blared from a speaker tucked beside one of the laptops. The group of employees went pale and motionless the moment Emma appeared. Someone managed to slam a hand onto the keyboard, silencing the music.

The singer turned, beaming, and Emma’s hands clenched. The young man’s shirt was unbuttoned, and on his bare chest, a bright red Santa Claus had been clumsily painted with lipstick.

""That’s enough. Get down. Go to my office and wait for me."" Emma said, loud enough for everyone to hear.

The guy hopped down from the desk, dusting his pants, completely oblivious to the terror radiating from the silent crowd. He leaned in conspiratorially toward Emma and whispered,

“Sure thing, boss lady, but you gotta point me in the right direction,” he said with an easy grin and gave her a slow, exaggerated wink.

A few people audibly inhaled.

Emma’s expression didn’t change, but the temperature in the room seemed to drop immediately. “Elevator,” she hissed, pointing a rigid finger. “Last floor. Move.”

He nodded quickly and backed away toward the doors.

Emma turned and seized the arm of the nearest person, Kate, the Head of Marketing, and pulled her several steps aside. Her voice lowered to a furious whisper. ""Kate, what the actual fuck is going on here?""

“Emma, I am so sorry! It was just… a short break. It’s Christmas Eve day and—”

“It’s Wednesday,” Emma interrupted, “I need the Q4 campaign performance report on my desk. Now. With the final conversion numbers.”

Kate blinked, caught off guard, spilling her words, “Yes, yes, I’ll send it up right away.”

“And Kate,” Emma added, scanning the still-frozen team with a steely look, “get your department under control.”

Kate swallowed hard. “Understood. It won’t happen again.”

Emma didn’t bother to reply, she was already turning towards the elevator. 

\*\*\*

When Emma entered her office, she saw Kyle facing the door, leaning against her desk. He toyed with her fountain pen, then set it down and eased back, resting his weight on his hands.

Emma shut the heavy oak door behind her with a loud slam.

“Get your ass off my desk,” she snapped.

“I was getting a bit bored.” He smiled, stood slowly, and took a step toward her.

He was tall, attractive, and well-built; her head was level with his bare chest. Her gaze drifted down his tanned torso, tracing the muscles. The clumsily drawn image of Santa Claus only added to his careless charm.

She let herself look at him for a moment longer, ""Let’s start with your name and role.”

“Kyle Leery. Marketing intern.” He paused, glanced at the gold plaque on her desk. “Nice to meet you, Emma Lane, the C-E-O.”

A hint of a fleeting smile ghosted across her lips. “Why are you still unbuttoned, Kyle Leery?”

“There was an email from HR, it’s a smart casual day, have you missed it?” He smirked as her gaze finally met his calm, blue eyes.

Her tone dropped a degree colder. “Did that email also tell you to get on the desk and sing?”

“Oh, not at all.” His grin widened. “That was my own initiative. Unleashing creativity in the spirit of Christmas team building.”

“You do realize, Kyle, I can fire you on the spot.”

“Sure, you can, but is it what you want?” He held her stare without flinching.

“You—” She started, raising a hand to point at him, but he stepped closer. Her hand brushed against his abdomen. With deliberate calm, he placed his palm over hers and pressed it lightly against his stomach. For a heartbeat, something unfamiliar surged through her, not desire, but recognition. That arrogant confidence. That carefree belief the world would obey his will. She had walked that same path once, before paying its price. An alluring smile touched his lips, but disappeared when Emma started to guide her hand lower. He watched, yielded to her initiative, curious where it would go.

The office door swung open. Marta stepped inside, a stack of documents in her arms, “Kate brought those reports you were ask—” She stopped mid-sentence, staring at her boss and the half-dressed young man locked in that strange, silent tableau.

“Marta”, Emma said, slowly withdrawing her hand, her gaze still fixed on Kyle, “would you please escort this young man back to his desk and help him pack his things. We are terminating his cooperation with immediate effect.”

Marta stepped aside, gesturing toward the door. Kyle’s confident demeanor faltered, his composure slipping. He hesitated, then muttered something under his breath before leaving, shoulders slightly hunched, eyes darting around as if trying to make sense of what had just happened.

\*\*\*

Emma walked into the conference room.  
At the head of the table sat a handsome man in his early forties, leaning back in a streamlined chair, a coffee cup balanced loosely in one hand. His black hair was brushed with gray at the temples, his beard neatly trimmed, his suit perfectly cut. 

When he noticed her, he set the cup down, rose, crossed the room and greeted her with a polite kiss on the cheek.

“Emma Lane,” he said, a hint of surprise in his voice. “I couldn’t believe it when I saw your name in our stack of offers.”

“Hello, Terry,” she replied, a smile tugging at her lips. “Good to see you, that gray suit actually matches your hair surprisingly well.”

He chuckled, “Well, thank you… walking in like that, with those heels, dangerously distracting. I’m not surprised you’ve turned your little ‘corporate retreat’ into all of this,” he said, spreading his hands. 

“Yeah, I’ve grown my corner shop a bit over the last fifteen years.”

“You were the most ruthless corporate lawyer I ever worked with. Everyone thought you’d lost your mind when you left to sell flowers.”

She laughed. “I know. I just wanted to escape the rat race. Can you believe that now?”

He smirked. “I just walked through the whole floor, people still working. Even Apple’s sweatshop employees are home by now, Emma. You have my respect.”

“What can I say, Terry? Christmas makes everyone sentimental, and reckless with money,” she said, entertained.

He burst out laughing.

“Speaking of reckless,” she added, sliding onto the edge of the conference table as she watched him carefully, “shouldn’t you be home with your wife and kids right now?”

“Maybe I should,” he admitted, grinning. “But I’m delaying it as long as I can. By now the kids are feral, and my wife’s operating like a festive food-production unit.”

Terry’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen. T-1000 flashed across it.

“Speak of the robot,” he said.

Emma actually giggled. She couldn’t help it, she reached for his coffee mug, and said, “You’d better answer that. I’ll make you another one.” She moved to the coffee machine in the corner while he answered the call.

“I’m sorry, babe, I’m stuck at the meeting,” he said, his voice getting all serious now. “You know how important that contract is…”

There was a pause, and he muttered something about cinnamon. “Cinnamon? Christ, where am I— yes, I’ll try...”

By the time Emma returned with a fresh coffee, she couldn’t help smiling at him. 

“I’ll be home as soon as I can,” he said, forcing a soft tone. A pause, “Me too.”

He ended the call with a quiet sigh, setting the phone down and looking back at Emma.

“Fucking hell,” he muttered, running fingers through his hair. “Where am I supposed to get her cinnamon at this hour? I’d rather be finalizing the quarterly earnings deck.”

“Hmm, family life,” she said with a twinkle in her eye. “You make it sound almost fun.”

“If it makes you feel better, Terry,” she continued slyly, “I’ll spend my evening coming up with excuses for why I shouldn’t hold my sister’s smelly toddler.”

Terry wrinkled his nose dramatically. “Ugh… sounds disgusting.”

Emma reached for the documents on the table and pressed them lightly against his chest. “You came over to talk about the offer,” she said, quick and sharp.

He let out a brief, amused laugh. “Oh… come on. Of course we sign it. You sent the best one anyway, my legal department will be in touch, I just wanted to come and see you.”

“I’m glad you came,” Emma let her fingers brush his hand in a deliberately lingering touch. Terry looked down, barely able to hide the thrill in his eyes.

\*\*\*

The Bentley’s lights flashed with a deep, electronic beep, throwing white reflections across the underground parking garage when Emma pressed the remote. She rarely drove herself, but tonight, she wasn’t waiting for the driver.

“Thirty-five Eastwood Road,” she said as she got into the seat and adjusted the mirrors. The navigation screen came to life, painting a red route through the city. Estimated time: two hours, thirty-five minutes.

“What a waste of time.” Emma sighed and tapped the steering wheel. “Alternate routes,” she ordered.

The display flickered into search mode. A few seconds later, a new line glowed across the map, through downtown, then the tunnel beneath the river. Estimated time: one hour, fifteen minutes.

She frowned, put her hand on the door handle, weighing her options. A moment’s hesitation, then a muttered, “Oh, Fuck it,” and the seatbelt clicked into place.

The car moved slowly through a sea of ​​brake lights. Emma kept her focus on the road, unfamiliar with the route. Every now and then, she checked the estimated time of arrival, each time it had crept higher. 

Then the movement stopped altogether. Sirens wailed somewhere ahead, echoing through the tunnel. She tapped her phone and pulled up the traffic feed: multi-vehicle collision, eastbound lanes closed until further notice. The surrounding cars idled, tail lights stretching endlessly ahead.

Emma exhaled sharply. “Of course,” she muttered and pulled the Bentley over, half-mounting the curb near a darkened, unkempt storefront. She looked up and noticed a low, welcoming light glowing across the street. A slightly tarnished neon sign read: Marley’s Spirit.

Before stepping out, she activated the car’s voice command. “Send a message to my sister,” she said,

“Accident in the tunnel. Can’t get through. Will make it up next year.”.

The synthetic voice read the message aloud, Emma’s lips pressed into a thin line. “Yes, send it,” she said. The system chimed in acknowledgment. She shut the engine down, unbuckled, opened the door, and walked toward the pub’s inviting glow, weaving between the trapped cars.

\*\*\*

Settling at the bar, she sipped her drink. Her posture was loose, one leg crossed over the other, a single heel dangling lazily from her foot. A soft, unbothered smile curved her lips. She peeked at her phone, seven unread messages from her sister, then set it face down on the counter and reached for her glass again. The place was almost empty, just the bartender polishing glasses and a handful of people scattered here and there, heads bowed over their drinks. A low jazz tune drifted from an old speaker, a pleasant escape from the relentless cheer of Christmas. 

She traced a finger along the rim of her glass, lost in thought, when a shadow moved beside her.

“Is this seat taken?”

She looked up. A man stood there, older, perhaps in his seventies, but lean and well-kept, with neatly combed gray hair and tailored cashmere sweater that spoke of quiet, understated elegance. His smile was easy, almost disarming.

“May I?” he asked, pointing to the stool beside her. “And perhaps… you could buy me a drink?”

That question caught her off guard, but then she saw his eyes, entirely free of expectation. No desire, no performance. Just… curiosity.

She hesitated, then said, “That’s an interesting line.” She gestured toward the empty seat. “What are you drinking?”

He nodded toward the bartender.

“Coffee, Mike. Please,” he said with an unhurried voice, then took the empty stool  at her side with quiet ease. 

Emma raised an eyebrow, “Do you often ask complete strangers to buy you coffee?”

He met her gaze steadily. “No… that’s a first,” he said, a brief pause hanging between them. Then, as if thinking aloud, he added, “But I’ve spent the last thirty Christmas Eves in this bar, and it’s the first time I’ve noticed someone sitting here alone… and actually not being miserable. That… got me curious.”

“Jonathan Whitaker,” he said, extending his hand.

Emma measured him for a second, then shook it. “Emma Lane,” she replied.

Mike appeared, placing a small cup of coffee in front of Jonathan with a knowing nod before drifting back to the far end of the bar. Jonathan stirred it once and looked back at Emma.

“Lane,” he repeated. “As in the flower ads, the Christmas ones?”

Emma’s expression sharpened. “We help bring our loved ones joy for Christmas.”

“Yes… that’s what the commercials say,” Jonathan said, his tone somewhere between amusement and doubt.

Emma let the comment pass.

“You sell sentiment,” he added finally. “Package emotions, put a price tag on love. Clever business.” He paused, eyes narrowing slightly. “What’s the return on that kind of emotional targeting?”

“Early data shows the campaign generated a seventeen-percent boost in sales,” Emma replied smoothly.

Jonathan lifted his cup in a small salute, his eyes glinting with cool approval. “Seventeen percent? That’s worth celebrating.” He took a slow sip. “To manufactured joy.”

Emma let out a soft, genuine laugh and raised her glass in reply. “You sound like a man with experience in the business of illusions,” she said, leaning forward just slightly. “So is this what you’ve been doing over the last thirty Christmases in this bar?” she asked, amused. “Research and company, I take it?”

He chuckled. “Neither, really. This is my quiet moment, my escape from the world. I can just sit here and enjoy jazz, watch the desperate ones come and go.”

“And here I am, ruining your study.”

“Oh, not at all,” he said, with a glint in his eyes. “Quite the opposite, you make it far more… compelling.”

He leaned back slightly, arms resting on the bar. “But, in the spirit of proper scientific research,” he added, “I have to ask… what brings a CEO here on Christmas Eve looking this content? Can’t just be the campaign numbers."" 

Emma shrugged lightly. “The tunnel’s closed, a total gridlock... I had to ditch my car across the street.”

Jonathan paused, studying her carefully. “I must admit… I’m struggling to see how this qualifies as a positive development.”

She tilted her glass, letting the ice clink gently. “Let’s just say I managed to avoid a rather questionably pleasant obligation.” She took a slow sip. “But you still haven’t told me, what exactly out there in the world are you hiding from in this bar?”

“Hiding? No, choosing.” Now leaning forward, he added, “Fair enough. Let me tell you how it all began.”

He looked past her as if replaying an old film only he could see.

“I dropped out of school at sixteen to make money,” Jonathan began, his tone even, almost detached. “Started as a swamper for a Teamster freight line, loading cargo, sleeping on dock floors, learning to back up trailers in empty lots after the veterans clocked out.”

“When I turned eighteen, I got my commercial licence and moved into local hauls. The pay was solid union money, but the real checks came from the hours, double shifts, midnight fuel runs, Saturday deliveries, anything no one else wanted.”

Emma listened with interest as he carried on.

“Once I was twenty-one, I moved into long-haul trucking, crossing states for weeks at a time. The sleeper cab became home; the CB radio, my only company. I chased miles like they were currency. I didn’t drink, didn’t date, didn’t spend. I pushed through blizzards and heat waves, lived on diner coffee and truck-stop specials, and stayed behind the wheel as long as my eyes would let me.”

“By 1975, the money started to dry up. The union was losing ground, competition was getting tougher, and the long hauls didn’t pay like they used to. I could see the writing on the wall, so I started looking for something else. I was twenty-five, with a hundred grand in the bank, roughly six hundred thousand in today’s dollars.”

“I assume you didn’t just spend it all on whiskey and girls?” Emma’s voice was calm, almost teasing.

“No, I invested every penny I’d saved into a rundown clinic. The clinic had gone bankrupt after a malpractice suit. I picked it up at a bank auction for pennies on the dollar. People thought I’d lost my mind. But I saw two things, the government was throwing money at medical procedures, and private health insurance was exploding. And from my trucking days, I already knew one simple truth. People don’t care about the cost when someone else is footing the bill.”

Emma raised an eyebrow. “So you just… bought a failed clinic at auction and thought you could make it profitable?”

He adjusted his watch with meticulous care, then looked back at her. “Back then, every patient could be profitable if you ran things right. It was all about optimization. I introduced twelve-hour shifts to maximize the use of equipment. X-rays and dialysis ran long hours, almost around the clock. I cut staff-to-patient ratios and made sure every patient paid their twenty percent share, no exceptions, no payment plans. Collections, liens, whatever it took. I basically turned that clinic into an efficient factory, and it became a goldmine. Got my hundred grand back in under a year, and that was without even pushing the billing. Just volume and efficiency. The real money came later.”

“Impressive,” she said, her eyes reflecting a mix of surprise and admiration.

“I knew the model worked. So I bet everything on it, cash, credit, even the clinic itself as collateral, to keep expanding. By the early eighties, I owned five specialized clinics, all tied together under one central office for billing and administration. That scale changed everything. I could finally negotiate prices on equipment and supplies, and, more importantly, the insurers started taking my calls. Volume meant power, and I had plenty of both.”

Jonathan ran his finger across the table, as if sketching an invisible map of his clinics.

“I wanted to keep growing. Success was like a drug, I couldn’t get enough. So I decided to open a hospital, the crown jewel of my little empire. It opened in late 1982. And then, in 1983, the entire business landscape flipped.”

Emma watched him closely. “The Prospective Payment System, right?” she said. “Medicare switched from cost-based reimbursement to fixed rates. Your patients stopped being assets and became liabilities.”

He looked at her, mildly impressed, letting out a quiet laugh. “Exactly. You know your history.”

“I know what happens when the rules shift mid-game. How did you turn it around?”

“Well, the clinics were barely making any profit, it was just a survival mode. I had to cut staff, supplies, even basic maintenance. And the hospital turned into a casino with terrible odds. Every patient was a gamble, and the complex cases were guaranteed losses.”

He exhaled slowly, dropping his gaze for a long, measured beat.

“It was a total clusterfuck. By mid-1984, I was four hundred thousand underwater. I had to sell the only clinic not tied up as collateral with the bank, just to keep the rest afloat. I was forced to keep the business running, or the bank would have called the loan. I was trapped.”

He fell silent for a moment; even the jazz seemed to quiet, and Emma found herself holding her breath.

“I would’ve sold my house too, if I’d owned one, but I’d poured every single dollar back into the business.”

“That was the only time in my life I was genuinely scared I’d lose everything I’d built. I had two options: figure out a way to fix this mess or go back to trucking hoping I would break even when I shut down the business. On my thirty-fourth birthday, I sold my car, bought two computers, and hired a student to write software to categorize patients into two profiles: financial risk and health profile.”

Emma leaned forward slightly, studying his face. “You… actually built software for that? in 1984?”

Jonathan nodded. “I had no choice. Spent nearly three weeks with this student, explaining exactly what I needed, reworking the app until it worked the way I envisioned.”

“As the system collected data, the hospital could finally identify patients who didn’t meet the criteria: predictable treatment paired with a high-reimbursing payer. Those who didn’t fit were either transferred, referred elsewhere, or quietly discouraged from coming at all. They were steered toward competitor hospitals, often government-run or public facilities still obliged to absorb the losses. The bleeding stopped, and I was back in business. It taught me two expensive lessons: always stay ahead of legislation, and never underestimate the power of data.”

Emma inclined her head slowly, eyes fixed on him, absorbing every word without interrupting.

“The moment the hospital stabilized I secured lucrative HMO contracts, cherry-picking the employee groups with the youngest, healthiest members, guaranteed monthly payments for patients who rarely showed up. With cash flowing again, I bought another distressed hospital for a fraction of book value, then quickly established my own medical equipment company to ensure every wheelchair and crutch sold went straight back into my pocket. By vertically integrating my business, owning the primary care gatekeepers, the specialized clinics, and the labs, I controlled the entire revenue stream. By the early nineties, the profits were colossal. I even bought a third hospital to run it at a strategic, controlled loss. It became my ultimate financial shield: the place where all the extreme, high-risk patients went. It kept the regulators and critics happy, and the massive tax write-offs from those losses kept the profits from the rest of the business high and clean.”

He let the statement settle while Mike appeared silently, refilled his coffee cup with a practiced hand, and drifted away again.

Jonathan scanned the room with a quiet authority, a knowing smile playing on his lips. 

“This place, Marley’s Spirit” he said, tapping the counter, “I own it.”

Emma returned his smile. “I thought you seemed suspiciously at ease in here.”

“Funny thing is,” he said, glancing at her, “I didn’t buy it in the usual way. A man came begging on Christmas Eve night, his wife was in my loss-absorbing hospital. She needed surgery, and her insurance had hit its ceiling. He offered me this bar, outright, if I’d move her up the list.”

He paused. “I checked the books first. The bar was barely breaking even. But the liquor license was solid, and the location good. She got state of the art care after I got her transferred to my main hospital the next morning. She lived another three years, maybe four. He left town after she died. I kept the bar and I kept coming back each year, to remember what desperate people are capable of.” 

He gave a small, almost amused shrug, “Some people called me cruel. It wasn’t cruelty, it wasn’t mercy, it was a transaction. You help someone when the math makes sense. That’s all.”

Emma’s fingers tightened slightly around her glass. She didn’t answer. The silence between them lingered. Her stool creaked under her, breaking the stillness. 

Jonathan cleared his throat and carried on, “In the late nineties, things got complicated again. It was getting harder to quietly steer patients away from my higher-profit specialists. The media was chasing stories about patient dumping, and regulators were finally paying attention. But this time, I was ready.”

He lifted an index finger, punctuating the last word.

“My new strategy wasn’t about cutting costs, it was about controlling the market. With cash pouring in, I started buying up rival hospitals and clinics, one after another. With centralized billing and management, it was easy to plug them into my network and turn them profitable in no time. The goal was simple: control sixty percent of the beds in a metro area, and the payers had to play by my rules. When you own the market, you set the price.”

Emma half-smiled, “Now that… that’s the dream of every CEO.” 

He nodded. “At the same time, I began investing more money into computers, servers and software. Electronic health records were becoming the next frontier, and I wanted to be ahead of everyone. That data center turned into my new crown jewel, the real engine behind everything else. As the number of records and processing power grew, so did what I could see, predict, and charge for.”

“But the real gamechanger arrived around 2010, marking my final victory over the system. I launched my own healthcare coverage program, bypassing the traditional insurer middleman entirely. Using the most precise, proprietary cost-of-care data in the business, and my health records database, I was finally able to risk-adjust every group premium with surgical precision. I could now match the premium not just to health profiles, but to the actuarial cost of every potential medical code and procedure. This completely removed the problem of unprofitable patients by pricing the risk accurately on the front end. I didn’t have to deny care; I simply priced my competitor’s risk out of the market, securing all the profit for myself.” 

His tone carried a cool satisfaction.

“I now run a fully privately owned healthcare system, over forty hospitals and 200 clinics across five states, all feeding my insurance company, the final, perfect machine that sets the price, and takes the profit.” 

Emma blinked, as if waking from a trance. “So where does it stop for you?”

Jonathan shook his head. “It doesn’t. You don’t build a machine this perfect just to stop the engine.”

“I’ve mastered the capitation model here. Now it’s time to take it global. The drug supply chain still eats too much of my margin, and I need to lock in long-term, government-backed revenue before expanding abroad. Europe, Asia, their public health systems are begging for data-driven efficiency. They just don’t know the price yet.”

Emma watched him for a long moment, fascinated. “All those choices you made over the years… do you ever regret any of it?”

Jonathan’s expression stayed calm, almost clinical. “Regret’s for people who messed something up. I did exactly what I meant to.”

She reached out, placed her hand over his, looked into his eyes and said, “Thank you, Jonathan… that was an inspiring story.”

Jonathan studied her for a beat, a subtle lift at the corner of his mouth. “You understand me.”

Emma withdrew her hand slowly, acknowledging the moment. “I do.” A pause, then a mischievous smile spread across her face. ""So... who supplies your hospitals with flowers?""",1,1764774224.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Morning everyone! grabbed coffee, opened Twitter, and my entire feed is on fire. Some legitimately game-changing stuff dropped in the last 24 hours that I actually need to talk through with people who get it.

Fair warning: this got long because there’s a LOT to unpack. Grab a snack.

## The “Holy Shit” Moment of the Day

**Mistral just went nuclear with their Mistral 3 release**

So I’ve been watching Mistral for a while, but this morning’s drop is legitimately insane. They released FOUR models at once—3B, 8B, 14B, and a absolute unit at 675B parameters (41B active). All Apache 2.0 licensed, meaning fully open source.

Here’s the part that made me do a double-take: **the 3B model runs entirely in your browser via WebGPU.** Like, not “technically possible but janky”—I literally just tested it and it’s responsive. A frontier-adjacent multimodal model… in a browser tab… using zero cloud compute.

The 675B version (they’re calling it Mistral Large 3) is currently sitting at #2 on LMArena. They trained this beast on 3,000 H200 GPUs and claim it runs 10x faster on NVIDIA’s new NVL72 systems.

*Genuine question: Are we at the point where open-source is actually catching closed models? Because this feels like a different era than 6 months ago.*

**What I’m doing with it:** Already spinning up the 3B model locally for a multilingual side project. The fact that I can fine-tune something this capable without AWS bills is kind of blowing my mind.

-----

## The Anthropic Double-Header

**1) They’re buying Bun (yes, THAT Bun)**

Anthropic just announced they’re acquiring the entire Bun JavaScript runtime team. If you’re not familiar, Bun is that blazingly fast JS/TS runtime that’s been making Node look slow.

The timing is wild because they’re announcing this alongside Claude Code hitting **$1 billion in milestone revenue**. The plan is apparently to integrate Bun’s speed improvements directly into Claude’s coding features.

As someone who uses Claude Code daily for debugging… yeah, I’m excited. My JS workflows are already 10x better with Claude, and if they’re making it faster? Sign me up.

-----

**2) Their internal AI usage study just dropped**

They published results from surveying 132 of their own engineers + analyzing 200,000 Claude Code sessions. The data on how AI is actually changing internal workflows is fascinating—productivity gains, role evolution, all that.

Honestly just refreshing to see a company publish real usage data instead of vibes-based claims. The full study is on their blog if you’re into that kind of thing.

-----

## Grok 4.1 is apparently really good now?

xAI’s new Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning model just topped the τ²-Bench-Verified leaderboard. Like, #1 overall, beating Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5, everything.

I’ll admit I’ve been sleeping on Grok because… well, it’s an Elon thing and the early versions were kinda meh. But these benchmark results are legitimate. Specifically crushing it on real-time reasoning tasks.

*Has anyone here actually used Grok 4.1? Genuinely curious if it lives up to the benchmarks or if this is another case of “great at tests, weird in practice.”*

-----

## The OpenAI/Google drama is getting spicy

**ChatGPT is hemorrhaging users post-Gemini launch**

This is the tea: someone analyzed the data and ChatGPT’s daily active users dropped **6% in the two weeks** since Google released their latest Gemini model. There’s apparently internal “Code Red” urgency at OpenAI right now.

The podcast episode they dropped today about GPT-5.1 training suddenly makes way more sense in this context. They’re talking up reasoning improvements, personality controls, better user interaction—classic “we’re still relevant” messaging.

Not gonna lie, I’ve been splitting time between ChatGPT and Gemini lately and… I get why people are switching. Gemini’s been surprisingly good for research tasks.

**Hot take incoming:** Maybe competition is actually good and we should stop treating this like sports teams? Both models getting better helps everyone.

-----

## Security stuff you should probably know about

**Perplexity released BrowseSafe**

It’s an open-source model + benchmark for detecting prompt injection attacks in real-time. If you’re building any kind of AI browser or web integration, this is probably important.

I haven’t dug into the technical details yet but the repo is on GitHub. From what I understand, it’s catching ~90% of malicious injections in their tests. Not perfect but way better than nothing.

*Question for the security folks: Is prompt injection actually a major threat vector in production or is this more theoretical? I keep seeing research but unclear how much this is happening in the wild.*

-----

## The robot that made me say “wait what”

**EngineAI unveiled their T800 humanoid**

Chinese company dropped a full-size humanoid robot demo: 173cm tall, 29 degrees of freedom joints, 450 N.m torque, 360° perception, 4-5 hour battery life.

The impressive part? They explicitly stated **all footage is real—no CGI, no AI enhancements.** Because apparently we’re at the stage where that disclaimer is necessary.

I’m not deep in robotics but the specs look legit? Would love to hear from anyone who actually builds this stuff. The torque numbers seem wild for something battery-powered.

-----

## Two quickfire mentions

**Ray’s Bloom:** First “on-brand” generative AI specifically for marketing/design consistency. Interesting for brand work but haven’t tested yet.

**Meta scanning private messages:** Starting Dec 16 unless you opt out (which is apparently a pain in the ass). Privacy folks are big mad about this. There’s already opt-out scripts floating around GitHub.

-----

## My actual thoughts on all this

The Mistral 3 drop is the one I’m most excited about. The shift toward truly capable open-source models feels like it could reshape how we build AI products. No more vendor lock-in, no more API rate limits killing your prototypes.

The OpenAI/Google rivalry getting intense is also lowkey the best thing for users. When companies have to actually compete, we get better tools faster.

The robot stuff is cool but feels further out from affecting my day-to-day. Still, watching the hardware side catch up to the software improvements is wild.

-----

## What I’m actually doing today:

1. Testing Mistral 3B locally for a translation project
1. Checking if Claude Code with Bun integration drops in beta (probably not yet but hoping)
1. Maybe playing with BrowseSafe for a web scraping tool that uses AI

**What about you all?**

- Anyone testing Mistral 3 yet? How’s performance vs. what they claimed?
- Grok 4.1 users—is it actually that good or am I getting hyped over benchmarks again?
- Anyone jumped ship from ChatGPT to Gemini? What made you switch?

Drop your experiments below. This community is way better when we’re sharing actual results instead of just reposting announcements.

🤖 if you’re building something with any of these today

The three most asked questions:
1. Will I ever heal?
2. How long do symptoms last?
3. Will I ever be cured?

Gastritis can either be short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic), and both are typically diagnosed as mild, moderate, or severe. Gastritis is further classified as active or inactive and erosive or non-erorsive. Sometimes the inflammation or diagnosis can also indicate the degree of symptoms. Whether it's acute or chronic and whatever the cause, most types of gastritis have shared similar symptoms and treatment protocols. Most people will heal or achieve remission with time and doing a good treatment plan. After healing, there may also be some mild lingering symptoms or occasional flare-ups that require long-term management and lifestyle changes.

Acute Gastritis. Acute gastritis is considered synonymous with active gastritis and usually develops suddenly. It is typically caused by infection or an irritant and often settles quickly with simple treatments or when the irritant is removed. Most causes of acute or erosive gastritis are from NSAIDS, vitamins, alcohol, food, and medications. Sometimes, it can become chronic. Acute gastritis usually can fully heal and be cured doing basic treatment protocols.

Chronic Gastritis. Chronic gastritis is a condition in which the stomach lining layers are damaged over a longer period of time. There are many causes of chronic inflammation such as: H.pylori, heavy drinking, smoking, surgery, drug abuse, atrophic, autoimmune, and many other reasons. Also, SIBO is typically a complication from having gastritis and usually not a cause. Chronic gastritis can be healed but is usually never fully cured. It often requires some type of long-term management with diet adjustments, lifestyle changes, and acid control medication when needed.

***Acute gastritis and reactive gastritis are similar, and both can come on suddenly. However, they are not the same. Reactive gastritis, also known as gastropathy or chemical gastritis, is similar to acute gastritis but is usually characterized by inactive inflammation. The main difference is that reactive gastritis is often from long-term damage, and acute gastritis is caused by short-term damage. Furthermore, reactive gastritis is not the same as active gastritis. While both involve stomach inflammation, active gastritis specifically refers to the presence of active and ongoing inflammation with neutrophils in the stomach lining - usually from infection or other causes. Whereas reactive gastritis is inactive inflammation leading to a more temporary irritation of the stomach lining.***

There are several reasons why some types of gastritis can completely heal or be cured, and others can not. The main reason is that once the stomach lining layers or esophageal valves have been weakened or compromised from chronic inflammation, the digestive tract can be easily irritated or inflammed. It really comes down to the length of time that the damage has occurred or the gastrointestinal condition and diagnosis. So yes, healing can absolutely happen, but there may also be some occasional symptoms or flare-ups.

I developed mild chronic gastritis and duodenitis that hit me hard in May 2022. Even though my symptoms started in May, looking back, I did have some occasional mild symptoms the year prior that would come and go, and I just never connected the dots. My digestive inflammation also affected the first part of the small intestine connected to the stomach (duodenum), and that often creates discomfort in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal area. My symptoms were cramping pain, back pain, weight loss, minimal appetite, feeling full without eating much, bloating, loose or discolored stools, fatigue, and occasional right upper quadrant discomfort, day after day and week after week. I also developed silent acid reflux that caused metallic or bad taste, hacking, and white mucus phlegm. 

My gastrointestinal tests of bloodwork, abdominal ultrasound, hida scan, cat scan, and colonoscopy were all normal except for my endoscopy. My endoscopy test showed mild chronic inflammation, and the biopsies were negative for H.pylori, celiac, bile reflux, atrophic, or any other cause. There were times I thought my condition was hopeless or some serious medical condition, and it also created a lot of uncertainty and frustration. 

I've also had a similar unknown gastrointestinal condition for over 25 years that would happen every few years. Those symptoms were usually mild and resolved after a couple of weeks. Tests were always negative. It may have been an ongoing digestive condition or a ticking time bomb that finally resulted in chronic gastritis. I also have a small sliding hiatal-hernia, but those are very common and usually no big deal. My current gastritis and duodenitis condition was most likely a result of stress, coffee on an empty stomach, eating large meals late at night, spicy food, and other lifestyle factors. Sound familiar??

There is hope...

My gastric treatment plan and success path consisted of doing diet adjustments, lifestyle changes, psyllium, acid control medication, supplements, and probiotics. An extremely important and key step for healing my digestive condition was protecting the stomach lining with either psyllium or slippery elm and also reducing stomach acid with PPIs or h2 blockers. My preference was doing psyllium (Konsyl) and famotidine (Pepcid) h2 blockers. There is NO quick fix or a perfect solution, and a one-size fits all treatment plan. Do not rush the healing process. If I had to rank the order of importance for treatment and management:

1. Anti-inflammatory Diet
2. Lifestyle Changes 
3. Psyllium or Slippery Elm 
4. H2 Blockers or PPI's 
5. Supplements
6. Probiotics 

Always remember that the two most important parts paramount for healing digestive inflammation are the anti-inflammatory diet and lifestyle changes. Without being truly loyal to doing those two steps, it really won't matter what else you do because the vicious insidious symptoms will keep reoccurring over and over.

After many months (one full year) and doing a good treatment plan, I have finally healed from mild chronic gastritis and duodenitis. I am again eating or drinking without any restrictions. My focus now is long-term management and flare-up prevention with diet adjustments, lifestyle changes, and psyllium once a day. H2 blockers and supplements are only as needed. I may not ever be 100% percent completely symptom free, but I feel normal again, and to me, that's the same as being cured. Because the digestive mucosal lining has been weakened or compromised from chronic inflammation, I also expect there will always be some mild lingering symptoms or occasional flare-ups. Knowing how to manage digestive inflammation will now make it very reassuring to avoid any uncertainty of healing and anxiety. 

The bottom line and, in my opinion, protect your stomach and digestive lining layers. Doing this key step along with diet and lifestyle changes will greatly help the healing process and bowel management. For me, psyllium was the magic protecting the stomach lining, healing inflammation, and restoring functional bowel processing. I have healed, so can you...

Finally, I'm not a doctor or therapist, but just someone with a lot of knowledge and personal experiences. Always discuss with a doctor or health specialist your condition and treatment options - especially diet, lifestyle, medication, supplements, probiotics, and the benefits of psyllium. Remember, minimum healing time for improvements is three months, but realistically, it's more like 4 - 12 months and sometimes longer. There may also always be some ongoing lingering symptoms or occasional flare-ups. Just stay positive, keep focused, and never give up.",1,1764774092.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

1. Anti-inflammatory Diet
2. Lifestyle Changes 
3. Psyllium or Slippery Elm 
4. H2 Blockers or PPI's 
5. Supplements
6. Probiotics 

(1) Anti-inflammatory Diet. Stay with foods 5.0pH or higher and nothing acidic. While I was healing: NO caffeine, NO coffee, NO alcohol, NO red meat, NO processed or fried foods, NO spicy, NO soda or soft drinks, NO milk, and very limited on bread, cheese, and dairy.

(2) Lifestyle Changes. No eating large meals or late at night. Eat smaller meals during the day with a little snack in-between. Keep your head elevated with extra pillows in bed. Limit bending over or any strenuous exercise to the abdominal muscles. Relax more and minimize stress. Taking short walks after eating helps digestive processing.

(3) Psyllium. I usually did one teaspoon of psyllium powder with eight ounces of water twice a day. Psyllium is very beneficial for protecting the digestive lining and functional bowel processing. Slippery Elm is also a great option for coating the stomach lining. Psyllium really helped to boost the healing process and ease symptoms. After my digestive issues improved, I reduced psyllium to once a day and for long-term management. 

(4) H2 Blockers. I did Pepcid (Famotidine) h2 blockers twice a day. The stomach acid medication helps alleviate pain, prevents ongoing damage, and significantly aids the digestive healing process. H2 blockers are typically for mild to moderate symptoms and reduce stomach acid by about 50% percent, are more gentle on the digestive system, and often have fewer side effects. PPIs are very aggressive at blocking stomach acid up to 90% percent and are usually for moderate to severe symptoms. PPIs can have more side effects that cause digestive irritation and also from long-term use, such as acid rebound or low stomach acid. Most people with uncomplicated gastrointestinal conditions usually only require H2 blockers and do very well. However, it really comes down to the specific diagnosis, symptoms, and what works best. Sometimes, it's just trial & error. 

(5) Supplements. I occasionally took papaya enzymes and DGL chewable tablets. Papaya enzymes were my favorite for bloating or indigestion, and I usually did one or two chewable tablets in between meals. DGL was helpful for silent acid reflux.

(6) Probiotics. After the initial 90-day healing phase, I did probiotic powder packets daily for several weeks. I then switched to doing high-grade probiotic capsules daily and occasionally zero-sugar probiotic yogurt. Lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium strains are the most studied probiotics and can be very beneficial for managing digestive conditions. Probiotics are very beneficial rebalancing the gut microbiome, reducing digestive symptoms, and side effects when taking medications, antibiotics, or acid control medications.

1pd6gr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1pd6gr4/as_expected_i_regret_this/,"as expected, i regret this.","this is a long, rambling post that’s written as my baby currently screams everytime she’s put down to sleep. please forgive the lack of coherent thought at times.

i always knew i wasn’t really one for kids. i’ve been married a while now, and my partner really wanted them. they were super patient about waiting and made it clear they would never force me, but it was clear it was a long held desire. on the other hand, i come from a cultural background where having children isn’t just the norm, it’s an obligation. my parents quite literally harassed me about having kids every year since i got married, with a lot of emotional and verbal abuse involved. it began to wear on me mentally pretty soon.

long story short, these two factors lead me to believe i could maybe have one kid and that i was ready for parenthood. i’ve felt maternal instincts to younger members of my family before, and i thought this was some indication that i could do it. i had a good pregnancy and even though there were tough aspects, i genuinely enjoyed it. the baby and i had a great bond in the womb and things were looking up. i was very excited to welcome my little one and thought things would just fall into place.

fast forward to a pretty traumatic labour that ended in an unplanned c section. when they placed my baby in my arms, i felt nothing. i was shaking from adrenaline and so thirsty. i just wanted water. 

people kept telling me it would get better. that when i went home, it would get better. that when we got past the newborn phase, it would get better. that when my baby was less better and began to smile it would get better. 

there are some good moments. none of them are enough to block out the fact that i was right the whole time: i am not a good mother because i wasn’t meant to be one. i was aware that parenthood comes with a lot of sacrifices, but the love and bond i felt with my baby in the womb convinced me it would all be worth it. that the love would only expand once the baby was out and make the sacrifices easy to bear. nothing could be farther from the truth. i do love my baby and have a sense of obligation to her. but i feel awful admitting that she isn’t the most important part of my life. 

my kid is a still a terrible sleeper and if it wasn’t for the fact that i’m currently staying with family, i would get no sleep. trust me, i’ve spent over $1000 on swaddles, sleep nests, bouncers, gas drops, anti colic bottles — you name it, i’ve bought it. i’ve tried all the sleep strategies, gently transferring her into a sleep space, shush pat, dedicating nearly every night to a good sleep routine. she’s still up several times at night despite being fed well. and this leads to bad daytime naps, and so the cycle repeats.

i’m working to find a good therapist to address these issues but my insurance plan has made that complicated (basically we have a super high deductible to meet and i would have to pay out of pocket from an HSA, sessions are about $200 which is a lot considering we have other health issues to address). i guess i’m open to medication if things get worse.

i’ve been a longtime lurker in this sub even before i had a kid, and i’m just glad there’s a space for me to vent. my partner has been extremely supportive, though i can tell it does make them sad that i clearly don’t want to spend much time with the baby. despite that, they’re empathetic and understanding. my parents on the other hand constantly deride me for wanting to do stuff outside of the baby, like see friends or go get a coffee. my father, who barely did anything when we were babies and gloats about it, is very comfortable calling me an incompetent mother. 

anyway, i’m not sure when this gets better or when i feel like all the struggle and stress is worth it. ",10,1764773995.0,regretfulparents,1,1.0,False

It was the night of the company dinner, an occasion that everyone had been eagerly anticipating. Each employee was given the chance to select a dish from the menu, a small luxury amidst the daily grind of deadlines and meetings.

As I sat at the table, savoring the moment, the new intern, Sadie, abruptly seized the menu from my grasp. Her sudden action caught me off guard.

“The dishes are enough. No more ordering,” she declared with an air of authority that was utterly unwarranted.

I chose to ignore her brazen behavior, turning my attention to the waiter who stood patiently by my side. “I’ll have one Mac and cheese, please,” I said, my voice steady, determined to assert my choice.

But before I could even register my order, Sadie slammed the menu against my face, her eyes blazing with indignation.

“When I say you can’t order, you can’t order! Who do you think you are?” she spat, her tone laden with condescension.

The sharp edge of the menu grazed my cheek, leaving a stinging sensation that ignited a fire within me. My temper flared, and without thinking, I snatched the menu back and returned it to her face with a forceful smack. She let out a shriek of surprise, her bravado faltering for just a moment.

“Do you have any idea who I am? My father is Wesley Modine—the most significant client this company has!” she shouted, her voice rising with each word.

“Even the CEO treats me with respect. You dare to lay a hand on me? Believe me, I can have your sales title revoked and ensure the entire industry blacklists you!”

I froze, momentarily stunned by her words. Wesley Modine was not just a name to me; he was my biological uncle. The realization hit me like a wave crashing against the shore.

He was forty years old, perpetually single, and now I was faced with this revelation: since when did he have a daughter old enough to be in a position of power?

Sadie’s smug expression grew even more pronounced as she noticed my silence. “What, scared now? A gold-digger like you, relying solely on your looks to get sales—letting you join this dinner is already an affront to the air we breathe. You really think you deserve to order food?”

Her words cut deeper than I would have liked to admit. Relying on my looks? The thought was laughable. I woke up before dawn to draft proposals, spent long hours at construction sites, and the sun had tanned my skin to a shade that made my mother do a double-take. Yet here was this intern, dismissing my hard work as nothing but superficial charm.

I pushed my chair back with a loud scrape and stood tall, locking eyes with her. “Hey, watch your mouth. I earn my place here by working my ass off. Everyone in this room can see it. You are in no position to insult me.”

“This is a company dinner, not your personal affair. If I ‘don’t qualify’ to order, then you certainly don’t either. No wonder I caught a whiff of something foul when I walked in—it was your mouth spewing nonsense.”

A few of my coworkers stifled their laughter, clearly enjoying the spectacle. They had long since grown weary of Sadie’s entitled demeanor.

Just a month into her internship, and she had already made a name for herself by treating everyone as though they were beneath her. I recalled the incident with Meg Wheeler, the new employee who had dared to refuse Sadie’s coffee request. Sadie had retaliated by pouring a scalding cup over Meg’s head, an act that left the poor girl with blisters and no apology in sight.

“If you even think about making me apologize, I’ll ensure you’re fired!” Sadie had threatened, her voice dripping with malice, leaving a chilling atmosphere in her wake.

The company had ended up covering Meg’s medical expenses, and I had wanted to defend her, to stand up against this bully. But my colleagues had restrained me, their expressions warning me against it. Now, I understood why—they were all intimidated by this so-called “daughter of Wesley Modine.”

Sadie’s face flushed a deep crimson, and she jabbed a finger toward my nose, her fury palpable. “Bitch! Stop pretending to be tough! Without my dad, this company would have crumbled long ago. At this dinner, I call the shots. If I say you can’t order, then you can’t!”

Her words hung in the air, heavy with the weight of her arrogance. The waiter, caught in the crossfire, glanced nervously between us.

“Ma’am… should I still place the order?” he asked hesitantly.

“Yes,” I replied, my voice firm and unwavering.

He is always looking at his phone uninterested when he orders. He’s not flirty or even chatty at all. Yes he’s cute but he makes no small talk so idk why it’s my coworkers crush.

Not because she’s insecure whatsoever- it’s just getting old. She doesn’t deserve to be made uncomfortable every time she comes in with her husband. My other coworker, another girl that’s friends with the 1st gyal, made a comment to the wife saying she “could not believe they’re married bc they have different aesthetics.” At this point it’s like the wife is being teamed up on and prodded at by my coworkers about her hot husband. The wife is cute grunge hipster & her husband is tall athletic build jock type. 
Idk if I’m seeking advice bc this is a moral dilemma I have no business in.. so why does it bother me? I hate to see good people minding their own business and especially married couple getting messed with. I guess I’m just bored and want to tell a story and see if anyone else deals with flirty coworkers that meddle with customers lives. I also want to be married one day and I would HATE if someone was doing this to me. ",0,1764773916.0,barista,5,0.33,False

I’m an experienced FX trader relocating to the UAE soon (Dubai specifically) and I’m trying to tap into the local trading scene before I land.

Back home I’m mostly active in Telegram trading circles, but I haven’t been able to find any solid UAE-based groups yet — ideally groups where people are actually talking strategy, sessions, market structure, prop challenges, and not just random signals or spam.

Quick profile so you know I’m not a total beginner:

* Trading full-time for the last few years
* Mainly FX (London/NY sessions), but I also trade indices occasionally
* Strategy: Price action, liquidity, SMC fundamentals (not into indicators)
* Comfortable contributing value, sharing analysis, and connecting with serious traders

I’d love to find:

* Active UAE trading communities (Telegram preferred)
* Meetups / social trading events in Dubai or Abu Dhabi
* Prop trading networks based in UAE
* Any local brokers worth looking into

I’m not looking for paid signal groups or “get rich quick” stuff — just real traders, real conversations.

If you’re in UAE and actively trading, or if you can point me to good Telegram groups/channels, I’d really appreciate it.

Happy to connect with like-minded traders and maybe grab a coffee when I’m there.

Part 1 of 3

This update is how I got better, what works for me, several tips & tricks, and a few ups or downs. Digestive irritation or inflammation can often be a lifelong management condition. Knowing basic protocols will make it easier to resolve symptoms.

Gastritis can either be short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic), and both are typically diagnosed as mild, moderate, or severe. Gastritis is further classified as active or inactive and erosive or non-erorsive. Sometimes the inflammation or diagnosis can also indicate the degree of symptoms. Whether it's acute or chronic and whatever the cause, most types of gastritis have shared similar symptoms and treatment protocols. Most people will heal or achieve remission with time and doing a good treatment plan. After healing, there may also be some mild lingering symptoms or occasional flare-ups that require long-term management and lifestyle changes.

After many, many months of healing and doing a good treatment plan, my ordeal has finally ended. Now, it's just a manage and maintain condition with a focus on flare-up prevention. I am eating good, have all my weight back, minimal to no symptoms, no longer on acid control medication, and feeling normal again. Special thank you to LG Capellan, who has provided us with his comprehensive gastritis healing book and the gastritis healing group. Also to Robin Parker Riha, our group expert and moderator, who provides all of us with helpful diet information and healing suggestions. Now, onto my success path, and there is hope...

I developed mild chronic gastritis and duodenitis that hit me hard in May 2022. Even though my symptoms started in May, looking back, I did have some occasional mild symptoms the year prior that would come and go, and I just never connected the dots. My digestive inflammation also affected the first part of the small intestine connected to the stomach (duodenum), and that often creates discomfort in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal area. My symptoms were cramping pain, back pain, weight loss, minimal appetite, feeling full without eating much, bloating, loose or discolored stools, fatigue, and occasional right upper quadrant discomfort, day after day and week after week. I also developed silent acid reflux that caused metallic or bad taste, hacking, and white mucus phlegm. 

Digestive inflammation often causes terrible weight loss, chronic diarrhea, discolored or loose stools, fatigue, and many other insidious symptoms. This is from the stomach lining being weakened or compromised from digestive inflammation, not breaking down food, and then the small intestine not being able to absorb undigested food. This bowel processing disorder typically results in bloating, indigestion, and digestive malabsorption of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. 

My gastrointestinal tests of bloodwork, abdominal ultrasound, hida scan, cat scan, and colonoscopy were all normal except for my endoscopy. My endoscopy test showed mild chronic inflammation, and the biopsies were negative for H.pylori, celiac, bile reflux, atrophic, or any other cause. There were times I thought my condition was hopeless or some serious medical condition, and it also created a lot of uncertainty and frustration. 

I've also had a similar unknown gastrointestinal condition for over 25 years that would happen every few years. Those symptoms were usually mild and resolved after a couple of weeks. Tests were always negative. It may have been an ongoing digestive condition or a ticking time bomb that finally resulted in chronic gastritis. I also have a small sliding hiatal-hernia, but those are very common and usually no big deal. My current gastritis and duodenitis condition was most likely a result of stress, coffee on an empty stomach, eating large meals late at night, spicy food, and other lifestyle factors. Sound familiar??

There is hope...

My gastric treatment plan and success path consisted of doing diet adjustments, lifestyle changes, psyllium, acid control medication, supplements, and probiotics. An extremely important and key step for healing my digestive condition was protecting the stomach lining with either psyllium or slippery elm and also reducing stomach acid with PPIs or h2 blockers. My preference was doing psyllium (Konsyl) and famotidine (Pepcid) h2 blockers. There is NO quick fix or a perfect solution, and a one-size fits all treatment plan. Do not rush the healing process. If I had to rank the order of importance for treatment and management:

1. Anti-inflammatory Diet
2. Lifestyle Changes 
3. Psyllium or Slippery Elm 
4. H2 Blockers or PPIs 
5. Supplements
6. Probiotics 

The first thing for me was to understand what I was dealing with and immediately doing diet adjustments and lifestyle changes. While healing or whenever having symptoms, my diet restrictions were: NO caffeine, NO coffee, NO alcohol, NO red meat, NO processed or fried foods, NO spicy, NO soda or soft drinks, NO milk, and very limited with bread, cheese, and dairy. I also try to avoid or limit high insoluble fiber foods like salads or lettuce and always stay away from any known triggers. Lifestyle changes were also extremely important. No eating late at night or large meals. Eat smaller meals during the day with a little snack in-between. Elevate the head with extra pillows in bed while sleeping. Limit bending over or any strenuous exercise to the abdominal muscles. Relax more and minimize stress. Taking short walks after eating to help assist digestive processing. I knew staying loyal to diet adjustments and lifestyle changes were absolutely paramount for any healing to occur.

I also needed to accept that there was no perfect solution or a quick fix and a one-size fits all treatment plan. The next step was to protect my digestive lining layers and reduce the stomach acid. These steps are equally as important to diet and lifestyle changes. Why?? Digestive inflammation creates difficult symptoms processing food and dysfunctional bowel processing. Doing psyllium and acid control medication greatly helped the healing process and easing the terrible symptoms. Especially psyllium because of its soluble fiber gel protective coating and functional bowel processing. Just doing these simple and basic steps gave me hope to stay positive, keep focused, and never give up. 

In the beginning and after my digestive symptoms had worsened, my primary healthcare provider gave me a referral for a gastroenterology evaluation. My referral was to a very busy office, but I'm sure that's common with most gastroenterology offices, and they were absolutely wonderful, providing me with outstanding medical care. Unfortunately, the primary doctor and gastroenterologist is almost always at the hospital doing medical procedures. But, the office has several other certified gastrointestinal physician assistants and nurse practitioners. I'm sure most offices operate that way so that the patients are first thoroughly screened and then referred to the primary doctor for evaluation and testing. The GI-doctor who performed my endoscopy did have a chat with me for a few minutes before doing my procedure. He was very understanding and listened to me and absolutely wanted to know exactly what was happening. Then it was lights out!!

At my GI office, the entire staff were always helpful and only wanted the best outcome for their patients. It can seem like a factory when being seen or screened because they stay very busy, and there are soooooo many people with gastrointestinal issues wanting answers. They were all really understanding with listening, screening, testing, and management. 

The following is a typical GI referral:

1. The initial GI office visit is usually for review of history and current symptoms and to start doing basic treatment protocols with diet restrictions, lifestyle changes, and acid control medication.
2. If symptoms worsen or there are no improvements after 30 - 60 days, then an abdominal ultrasound is often recommended to check the gallbladder.
3. If the abdominal ultrasound is normal and symptoms continue, then a hida scan is sometimes recommended to check the gallbladder function.
4. After 90 - 120 days from the first GI office visit and there are no improvements, then an endoscopy is usually recommended.
5. An abdominal cat scan may also be ordered either before or after the endoscopy to help the doctor rule in or out what's happening.

I had all these tests done, and all were normal except for my endoscopy with biopsies that showed mild chronic gastritis and peptic duodenitis.The entire gastroenterology staff were simply amazing and also allowed me to do H2 blockers instead of PPIs. Medical procedures are usually not done immediately unless there is an urgent need. Unless something is obviously serious and requires an urgent procedure, be prepared to just follow the standard basic protocols for screening and testing.

Gastrointestinal conditions and disorders can be complicated or mysterious, stubborn, and often require many different types of treatment methods. Unfortunately, just like so many other countries and also here in the United States, once you do have a diagnosis of digestive inflammation like gastritis, that more emphasis on different therapy options or natural protocols isn't discussed or made available like what we have in our support group or from the book. Most doctors or health providers just recommend doing basic diet adjustments and lifestyle changes and prescribing acid control medication. That's why it's extremely important to thoroughly discuss your gastrointestinal symptoms and history.

Thankfully, after receiving my gastroenterology referral, they were very proactive and thorough with screening, testing, diagnosis, and treatment. Most importantly, they provided a positive reassurance of being there for me and that everything would be okay with doing a good treatment plan. Completing gastrointestinal screening, testing, and then receiving an accurate diagnosis is essential for having a true success path.

I could really use some outside perspective on this — it’s been confusing me for a long time.

About two years ago, when I joined my first company, there was this girl I found cute. It was my first job in a new city, so I was shy and a bit nervous at first. She, on the other hand, was quite friendly — she used to call me for lunch, come sit next to me, take me along for coffee or cigarette breaks almost every day. Naturally, I started liking her.

After a while, I got transferred to a different office location in the same city, so we didn’t get to hang out much. But she kept messaging me, often saying things like *“let’s meet for dinner”* or *“let’s go party sometime.”* Every time I’d agree and get excited, she’d suddenly stop replying or just disappear. Then a few weeks or months later, she’d message again — same pattern.

It was frustrating. I even told her once that what she was doing was really stupid — that she shouldn’t initiate plans if she wasn’t serious. Eventually, I switched jobs, and so did she. Now she’s back in her hometown.

After that, I decided I’d had enough. I removed her from my Instagram and completely stopped initiating any conversation from my end. But even after that, she still kept popping up randomly — wishing me on my birthday, sending a flirty *“Heyluu”* out of nowhere, and then when I’d politely reply or ask how she’s been, she’d just ghost me again. I even wished her on Diwali — same thing, no reply.

At this point, I’m not even emotionally invested anymore. I just don’t get it.  
**Why does she keep coming back only to vanish again? Why can’t she act normal? What does she even want?**

It was the night of the company dinner, an occasion that everyone had been eagerly anticipating. Each employee was given the chance to select a dish from the menu, a small luxury amidst the daily grind of deadlines and meetings.

As I sat at the table, savoring the moment, the new intern, Sadie, abruptly seized the menu from my grasp. Her sudden action caught me off guard.

“The dishes are enough. No more ordering,” she declared with an air of authority that was utterly unwarranted.

I chose to ignore her brazen behavior, turning my attention to the waiter who stood patiently by my side. “I’ll have one Mac and cheese, please,” I said, my voice steady, determined to assert my choice.

But before I could even register my order, Sadie slammed the menu against my face, her eyes blazing with indignation.

“When I say you can’t order, you can’t order! Who do you think you are?” she spat, her tone laden with condescension.

The sharp edge of the menu grazed my cheek, leaving a stinging sensation that ignited a fire within me. My temper flared, and without thinking, I snatched the menu back and returned it to her face with a forceful smack. She let out a shriek of surprise, her bravado faltering for just a moment.

“Do you have any idea who I am? My father is Wesley Modine—the most significant client this company has!” she shouted, her voice rising with each word.

“Even the CEO treats me with respect. You dare to lay a hand on me? Believe me, I can have your sales title revoked and ensure the entire industry blacklists you!”

I froze, momentarily stunned by her words. Wesley Modine was not just a name to me; he was my biological uncle. The realization hit me like a wave crashing against the shore.

He was forty years old, perpetually single, and now I was faced with this revelation: since when did he have a daughter old enough to be in a position of power?

Sadie’s smug expression grew even more pronounced as she noticed my silence. “What, scared now? A gold-digger like you, relying solely on your looks to get sales—letting you join this dinner is already an affront to the air we breathe. You really think you deserve to order food?”

Her words cut deeper than I would have liked to admit. Relying on my looks? The thought was laughable. I woke up before dawn to draft proposals, spent long hours at construction sites, and the sun had tanned my skin to a shade that made my mother do a double-take. Yet here was this intern, dismissing my hard work as nothing but superficial charm.

I pushed my chair back with a loud scrape and stood tall, locking eyes with her. “Hey, watch your mouth. I earn my place here by working my ass off. Everyone in this room can see it. You are in no position to insult me.”

“This is a company dinner, not your personal affair. If I ‘don’t qualify’ to order, then you certainly don’t either. No wonder I caught a whiff of something foul when I walked in—it was your mouth spewing nonsense.”

A few of my coworkers stifled their laughter, clearly enjoying the spectacle. They had long since grown weary of Sadie’s entitled demeanor.

Just a month into her internship, and she had already made a name for herself by treating everyone as though they were beneath her. I recalled the incident with Meg Wheeler, the new employee who had dared to refuse Sadie’s coffee request. Sadie had retaliated by pouring a scalding cup over Meg’s head, an act that left the poor girl with blisters and no apology in sight.

“If you even think about making me apologize, I’ll ensure you’re fired!” Sadie had threatened, her voice dripping with malice, leaving a chilling atmosphere in her wake.

The company had ended up covering Meg’s medical expenses, and I had wanted to defend her, to stand up against this bully. But my colleagues had restrained me, their expressions warning me against it. Now, I understood why—they were all intimidated by this so-called “daughter of Wesley Modine.”

Sadie’s face flushed a deep crimson, and she jabbed a finger toward my nose, her fury palpable. “Bitch! Stop pretending to be tough! Without my dad, this company would have crumbled long ago. At this dinner, I call the shots. If I say you can’t order, then you can’t!”

Her words hung in the air, heavy with the weight of her arrogance. The waiter, caught in the crossfire, glanced nervously between us.

“Ma’am… should I still place the order?” he asked hesitantly.

“Yes,” I replied, my voice firm and unwavering.

I'm so confused and so dissociative.

There's a million things, but this is one of the things I'm struggling to cope with. Someone please give me some perspective or...just anything.

I'll try make this short.

I'm 22F. I met this guy 31M earlier in the year online. We met up for coffee. There was Zero chemistry, but he was really nice. I've been in an abusive relationship previously and have also bee raped. I hadn't been out wjth anyone for like two years.

I decided that maybe if I focused on the fact he was so nice and not on looks that would fix my problem??

I saw him again, for a walk.

I saw him after that when he invited me to his house for dinner. Luckily I was on my period so when things started getting sexual, I had the ability to pull his hand away from my jeans and say ""I'm on my period."" He gave me a funny look and I panicked that he was going to get nasty so I said: ""But next time, don't worry.""

Next time rolls around. He's invited me to stay over night. I jumped at the opportunity to get away from my mother (she has BPD and has been so abusive) and accepted the invitation.

He picked me up on the day, we drove back to his. We made dinner, as I'm cooking he starts slapping my butt CONSTANTLY, this continues through the whole evening. Sometimes I said ""ow"" sometimes I screamed because I would get a fright and he'd slap me So fricken hard it honestly hurt. 

We put a movie on, like a third of the way through we start kissing. Somewhere in my head I obviously knew when I accepted his invitation that things would obviously get sexual, but I thought I migjt be able to handle it and stand my ground this time.

NO.

He starts undoing my jeans, Takes his shirt off etc. I just go along with it. But I'm literally panicking and so so so so scared and not ready in the slightest to have sex. I couldn't say anything, can't verbalise it, can't move away, I just GO ALONG WITH IT. He starts actually having sex with me and it hurts so badly I can't describe the pain. But still I just can't say anything, I just keep going along with jt hoping and preying somehow it will stop. It doesn't.

I want him to use a condom and I think I manage to ask ""Do you have a condom?"" and he says ""Yeah."" but doesn't use it and I can't seem to stand up for myself and ask him to use one again. 

That night we go to bed and he has sex with me again. It's even more painful because I'm tender from earlier. I'm so tense and not turned on in the slightest. He even says ""you don't seem comfortable."" I don't think I replied.

We go to sleep eventually, or he does, I'm still awake and in so much pain and so triggered I just want to get up and runaway out the door, but he lived in the middle of the countryside so no one and no where to run to.

I finally fall asleep for a bit. He wakes me up and is having sex with me. I fall asleep again and in the morning I wake up and he's on top of me AGAIN. This time he cums in side me. Then rolls over and says ""You're on BC aren't you?"" and I said ""No. I was on my period the other day, don't you remember?"" and he won't let me go home until he's taken me to the pharmacy to buy the morning after pill. He thanks me for getting it, because his Ex got pregnant and he had to get her to terminate it ?? Throughout the morning getting ready and stuff he slaps my butt as hard as he can when I'm least expecting it.

Anyway because I'm trapped wjth my mother somehow my idiotic self keeps seeing this guy. And basically every encounter goes like the first. He won't wear a condom, Is really rough with me, I'm in pain and never turned on and he always remarks how uncomfortable I always seem and I never have the ability to stand up for myself and just go along with it.

I legitimately feel broken ""down there"". I don't know if I'll ever be able to have sex again I'm so traumatised. I don't know why I'm so traumatised by it because he didn't rape me. As far as he was concerned it was all consensual and I wanted it even though I didn't, but he didn't know that.

I also wound up pregnant and he tried to guilt trip me into aborting jt, but that goes against everything I believe in. I ended up misscarrying at 7 weeks anyway which he doesn't know. And that has literally destroyed me too. I can't really get over that. 

The sex though, I think I'm physically damaged down there. Imm so traumatised by it and I have nightmares and intrusive images about it. Psychologically I still feel the pain down there. I'm scared I'll never be able to trust any man again or have sex again. Why do I feel like this if he didn't rape me?  

And how can I learn to say no and not freeze if I'm in this situation again?

I understand it takes time, and I won’t immediately go from an entry-level role to a hiring or management position.

My daily checklist includes cleaning and restocking the men’s locker room, coffee/snack bar, water station, pool area, seating area, tennis courts, fitness rooms, and the activity center itself. Duties involve wiping down equipment and mirrors, cleaning sinks, toilets, and showers, restocking towels, straightening furniture, emptying trash, and making sure everything is fully stocked and presentable.

There is a supervisor who oversees the activity center area, and I struggle when she comes into the men’s locker room to check cleanliness. Since I’m near-sighted and don’t wear my glasses at work, it’s hard to tell if the floor needs mopping or if sinks need cleaning, especially because the locker room already looks clean to me. I try to keep a great attitude and take feedback seriously, but I feel my actions haven’t always reflected that. She also emphasizes that I need to respond respectfully, using “yes ma’am” or “no ma’am,” which I am working on consistently.

I really want to become a better worker, improve my attention to detail, and grow in this role so I can advance toward my long-term goal. What strategies or advice can help me improve my work performance and professionalism in this type of hospitality role?",1,1764773705.0,Adulting,1,1.0,False

I am happy to have found this reddit for my own sanity right now. So 55 y/o male just started treatment for NSCLC stage III 7cm tumor left lung. Blocking bronchus with collapsed lung, encasing pulmonary artery. Inoperapaple because of its location and involvement with critical structures. It really has been a ride these last two months going through diagnosis.

So started in radiation and chemo last week. Just had my second chemo Carboplatin / Paclitaxel. And will be continuing through January 9th. I am on a leave from work through Jan 11th.

So I am a lifelong gamer and wanted to just get out here. It has been depressing and I spent a lot of time in front of TV these last month or so. But have gotten myself back in front of the PC again. It's a big trigger for me because drinking a pot of coffee and smoking cigarettes was the thing I did while gaming. Now I am totally non smoking for the last month. But sitting in front of a game, makes my want to smoke. And the would be both cigs and weed.

So here's to some changing habits.

Right now I am playing some civ VII. Despite the poor reviews, I am giving it a look as civ has always been a favorite of mine. Coming up though, I will be moving back over and starting a new character in Ashes of Creation test. So I think I have the next six weeks of treatment and being off work to play test some more of the game

— and will try to set pajama world record | Saturday December 6th from 6pm to 9pm","https://reddit.com/link/1pd68la/video/dbqn7sct405g1/player

Long Beach’s 41st annual Belmont Shore Christmas Parade will return this weekend to not only spread holiday joy — but also try to break a world record.

The parade will take place from 6 to 9 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 6, along Second Street in Belmont Shore — and will be the world’s biggest pajama party. This year’s theme is “Jingle Jammies,” because organizers are asking participants and spectators to wear their festive pajamas to help set a world record for the most people in pajamas at one time.

The Belmont Shore Christmas Parade, which is put on by the Belmont Shore Business Association, will have more than 100 entries that include local marching bands, dancers, floats designed by Long Beach businesses and associations, local personalities and dignitaries, and an appearance by Santa Claus — with help from the Long Beach Fire Department.

“We’re excited to host the parade again and produce it for the 41st time,” Heather Kern, executive director of the Belmont Shore Business Association, said in an interview, “and have everyone’s favorites return and some extra special guests.”

Christmas pajamas are a big part of Kern’s family holiday season, she said, which inspired the idea for this year’s theme and breaking a world record. At the moment, the world record for the largest gathering of people wearing two-piece pajamas at a single venue is 2,052 participants, achieved by IKEA employees in Sweden in 2024, according to Guinness World Records.

“I know that that is easy for us to defeat,” Kern said. Organizers are also excited for spectators to see the most light-up bikes than in the past, corgis and dalmations in their Christmas outfits, low rider cars, an appearance by the Long Beach State men’s volleyball championship team, Star Wars stormtroopers, and more along the parade route.

This year’s grand marshals are David Shlemmer of Shlemmer Investments, Mike Sheldrake of Sheldrake Coffee Roasting, Paige Henley from McCarty’s Jewelry and Dede Rossi, the former executive director of the Belmont Shore Business Association. The parade will once again be hosted by TV personalities Bob Goen and Marianne Curan, with field host Lisa Ramelow, for the cozy, fun-filled evening, organizers said.

The parade route is along East Second Street and will begin heading east from Quincy Avenue to Bayshore Avenue. Residents in the area should plan accordingly, as East Livingston Drive will close at 3 p.m. for the parade’s entry line-up and staging. East Second Street will close to traffic at 4 p.m.

Free parking will be available at the Beach Parking Lots along Ocean Boulevard and at Marine Stadium. Organizers ask that attendees start reserving spaces after 4 p.m. on Saturday to help keep Belmont Shore safe and walkable before the parade begins.

Sponsors that have made this year’s parade possible include the Port of Long Beach, Councilmember Kristina Duggan, WAFD Bank, AES, Long Beach City College, LBS Financial, Farmers & Merchants Bank, Chase Bank, PowerTrip, Legacy, Long Beach Airport and Long Beach Transit.

If people are unable to make to attend the parade in person, a livestream will be available at [https://BelmontShore.org](https://BelmontShore.org)

I am currently 34 days Zyn free. I was using about 9-10 6mg pouches per day (some days more).  Back in October I was at work when I was suddenly hit with a massive panic attack (never had panic/anxiety attacks prior). With that panic attack came the most intrusive thoughts you could imagine.  It was scary as hell. I thought I was dying.  Especially for someone that has never dealt with a panic attack before.  I got home and started doing research on what just happened to me.  I stumbled upon this sub on Reddit.  I was shocked how many people reported almost identical symptoms as me.  

I decided right then I needed to quit.  I went cold turkey.  It was pure hell the first 2.5 weeks. First few days I had flu like symptoms and crippling anxiety and panic attacks with intrusive thought’s. I also had the this strangest muscle “tingling’ in my arms and fingers.  As man have reported I had some horrible GI issues.  I also noticed that drinking too much coffee in the AM would trigger some of that anxiety and intrusive thoughts shortly after.  So I cut back on my coffee consumption dramatically. Some recommend cutting caffeine completely, after all it is a stimulant. So keep caffeine in mind while you are on your journey. 

Around week 4 I noticed a bit of a positive change.  Less anxiety/panic attacks with the intrusive thought’s. I still get them but they are more manageable and not as severe. For example I was doing great the last 3 days then suddenly I was hit with an anxiety/panic attack out of nowhere.  But it only lasted for a few minutes and subsided.  Breathing techniques have helped when that waive comes. My GI issues started to return to normal around week 3. I honestly have no craving for a Zyn at this point.  After you realize what it does to you that is motivation enough to never use it again because I don’t want to feel like that ever again. 

There is light at the end of tunnel. My advice to anyone who might see this:  I thought at the beginning of quitting “I’m never going to be normal again”.  That is not true. You will, but it will take time.  I’ll be honest, It’s going to suck at times. For some it may take longer.  But you can do this. Zyn is pure poison and it destroys you in time. I have not read one post from someone saying that they never got better. So keep that in mind. The glass is half full.  I would say today I am about 70-80% better. 

It’s amazing how nicotine can destroy your mental and physical health so quickly. I am thankful I found this group, ChatGPT helped also, it gives me a daily plan and daily updates where I should.  The support you get from other people in this sub, dealing with the same issues as you is so important.  You all got this, you CAN DO IT. ",7,1764773400.0,QuittingZyn,4,1.0,False

I flew to Dublin from the west coast on a \~10 hour flight each way.

The outbound flight to Dublin left in the late afternoon and was overnight, arriving mid morning.

The inbound flight was a day flight that left mid morning from Dublin and returned mid afternoon on the west coast.

On the outbound flight, they served dinner about 1 hour after takeoff. There was a choice between chicken and rice or pasta and red sauce w/ cheese. Both options came with a roll, a small pudding-like cake, a side salad and water.

About 1 hour before landing, we were given small egg and cheese sandwiches for breakfast (there was a version with bacon and a vegetarian version).

On the day flight, lunch was served about 1 hour into the flight. The meal options were chicken curry or pesto ravioli, again along with a roll and a small sweet.

On this flight I wanted to try something different so I actually requested the kosher meal in advance. They brought it to me right before meal service started. The kosher meal was chicken, rice and vegetables with a roll, a blueberry muffin and a side dish of pickled vegetables. The kosher meal came in a sealed box with a kashrut certificate inside.

Coffee and tea was served throughout, and you are entitled to one alcoholic beverage (beer or wine) that you can get before the meal during the first drink service.

Overall I was surprised by how good the food was. Of course, it's still airline food so you don't get a lot of food and it's not like it's restaurant quality. However, it was all served piping hot. The flavor was on par with any TV dinner you might get at the store. 

I would still strongly recommend bringing snacks as you probably won't be full by the end of the flight. Hopefully this helps!",6,1764773231.0,AerLingus,1,0.88,False

""If there's one antagonist race that just about every ""Star Trek"" fan finds underwhelming, it's the ""Star Trek: Voyager"" villains, the Kazon. They're not just a cornier, big-haired take on the Klingons — they're more like the Temu knock-off version right down to their less impressive facial ridges and watered-down warrior ethos, making the fact that they get so much airtime in the first two seasons of ""Voyager"" almost intolerable.

https://www.looper.com/2016973/iconic-star-trek-villains-actually-overrated/

Freshly stranded in the Delta quadrant, the Voyager crew first encounters the Kazon in the ""VOY"" premiere episode ""The Caretaker,"" where they show up as oppressors of the even more ridiculous Ocampa (just try to do the math on how long a species that can only have one child per female survives). But they're more like 19th century Birmingham street gangs than actual warriors, and they serve as more of a nuisance to Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) and her crew than any kind of credible threat. 

Misogynistic, disorganized, and none too bright, the Kazon were about as toothless as a ""Star Trek"" villain comes. As one fan wrote on The Trek BBS, ""To call them cavemen is an insult to cavemen."" A foe so unworthy was never truly a match for Janeway — at least, not after coffee.

[...]

The Bluegill parasites

It's true that the whole conspiracy nature of the Bluegills' Starfleet Command doings make them a formidable foe. But if you look just a little bit closer, it's almost hard to understand how they made it as far as they did in the admiralty. By the time they've infiltrated the upper ranks in ""Conspiracy,"" Starfleet HQ is positively abuzz with conspiracy rumors. 

And we know they're neither stealthy or discreet by the absolute botch job that the artist, formerly known as Real Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello), makes of his attempt to infect Riker aboard the Enterprise. They might be fast, but not so fast someone with a phaser or a decent pair of regulation boots could not take them out. Worse, they follow vampire rules, meaning if you kill the queen parasite, the rest of them die — which is just patently ridiculous, not to mention one heck of a vulnerability.

[...]

Lutan from Code of Honor

The fact that no self-respecting ""Star Trek"" fan wants to look too closely at the reality that the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" episode ""Code of Honor"" happened doesn't mean it didn't. But if we can look past the cringeworthy racial stereotyping and the gratuitous use of lamé in a ""Star Trek"" episode Jonathan Frakes has openly called ""embarrassing,"" we'll find a villain so overrated (and underpowered) that he causes Picard to completely fumble the whole situation.

The gentleman in question is the infamous Lutan (Jessie Lawrence Ferguson), the leader of the Ligonian people. Bossy, arrogant, and hot for Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby), Lutan gets the bright idea to kidnap the ship's chief of security and hold a much-needed vaccine hostage. By the end of the episode, he's inadvertently gambled away all he has, losing everything when Yareena (Karole Selmon), the wife from whom his authority derives, temporarily dies, thus dissolving their marriage contract.

As he's standing there all egg-face, there's a general sense that this man got his just desserts as a guy who chose to risk his First One and his people's diplomacy with the Federation. But at the end of the day, he wasn't even really a villain at all; he was just acting according to his culture's norms. The true villain in this story is the person charged with preparing the Starfleet briefing materials for their diplomatic encounter and didn't give anyone a head's up that showing up with a sassy security officer was a bad idea with these folks.

I was a bully. I’m taking really awful shit, embarrassing girls and talking behind their back, manipulating them and setting up situations to make them look bad or to just straight up hurt them. I’ve cut a girl's hair before because it was longer than mine, I’ve made people cry and it was all really easy for me. Nothing really came of it until after high school. I had chilled out a lot post graduation but could still be kinda mean. In uni I met a group of really nice girls that I wanted to be friends with, but it felt like something was stopping us from getting close. That made me sit back and think about how I acted and why. 

Simply put it was jealousy. I was insecure and jealous of everyone around me and hurt people to make myself feel better. It’s ugly and not an excuse but it is the reason. I realised I didn’t want to be that person, these new girls are some of my favourite people I’ve ever met, and none of them would ever dream of treating people the way I used to. So I made an effort to change, I never told them about how I used to act, but I started really trying to be nicer, I even reached out to a few of the girls I was the worst to in school to apologise (not to good results) and I thought I was a completely different person now. 

Clearly the girls agreed because soon after I became a natural part of their group and got really close with a lot of them. My best friend from that group is S (20,F) She’s one of the sweetest people I’ve ever met, we’re in the same arts course and she’s so incredibly talented. She’s beautiful, smart and really kind. She's fun to be around and go out with but also to have a deep conversation with. Truly the once in a lifetime sort of person. There’s only one issue with her. Her girlfriend A (21, F). 

She literally hasn’t done anything wrong. She’s quiet and really reserved, very formal in how she talks and dresses and she can be a bit awkward at first, but that’s literally it. She’s a seamstress and the clothes she makes are genuinely beautiful and she’s a really talented writer and poet. You can tell just from talking to her she’s crazy smart, she’s always quoting something I’ve never heard of and reads philosophy books for fun. She’s also absolutely gorgeous, she’s literally every beauty standard for women wrapped up in one person. Her and S have been friends since high school and got together in year 11 and she’s mad about her. She treats S really well, they’re obviously happy together, and she’s a really sweet girl when you talk to her for a bit and get past the awkwardness. 

But I fucking hate her. I hate her hair and that’s smoother and longer and blonder and healthier than mine. I hate her skin and how clear it is. I hate her small button nose and her tiny waist and her huge eyes. I hate how smart she is without ever trying, that she’s smarter than I’ll ever be. I hate that I leave ever conversation with her having to look up ten new words and feeling like a fucking moron. I hate how talented she is with sewing. 

I hate how thin she is, I literally can’t sleep some nights just thinking about her body and how much I hate her for it, she’s visibly underweight to an unhealthy degree, but she’s just so beautiful and frail looking, she’s smaller than model thin and based of picture she has been for years. She looks like a porcelain doll. I hate that she’s nice to me, that she made a dress for my birthday, came up with the pattern, picked out the fabric, sewed it all by herself and everything. I hate that I love it, that it fits me perfectly, that it’s exactly my style and covered in hand beaded designs. I hate that this is how kind she is to someone she’s not ever that close to. I absolutely fucking hate her. 

She’s exactly the sort of girl I would have gone after in high school. I would have made her life a living hell and not thought twice about it because I would have been jealous out of my mind. And I am. I’ve always thought this way about her but I’ve just tried to clamp it down and ignore it, but her and S recently moved in together so I was seeing her a lot more. Ever reminders of her make me angry, seeing her books on the coffee table when I’m hanging out there with S, opening the fridge and seeing the water bottle she brings to uni, hearing her sewing machine go in another room. I tried to ignore it but I couldn’t do it. I don’t want to act like that again or be that person but I just couldn’t help it and I didn’t know what else to do. 

I kept catching myself being mean to her whenever S wasn't around. Snarking at her and telling her to speak louder when she talks quietly, commenting on her writing or school work backhandedly and shoulder checking her whenever I walked past. I didn’t even notice I was doing it at first and when I did I couldn’t help myself. She stopped eating whenever I’m around because every time she did I’d make a comment about how much she was eating or what was in it.

They were all obvious lies. She hardly eats anything and everything she does eat is tiny portions of healthy foods. I slept over one night and spent the day with her and S and all she ate was two spoons of low fat yogurt with a handful of raspberries, a single rice cracker, and some blueberries dipped in cottage cheese. I rounded up to about 200 calories in a 24 hour time frame. Seeing her eat at all was rare and now I never do. I didn’t really think anything of it and I’ve been getting meaner and meaner, me and S are just as close as ever so she clearly hasn’t said anything. I hate who I become whenever she’s around but I can’t help it. Just seeing her makes me so angry. And I honestly didn’t really think it was doing anything until the other day. 

S came to me saying she was worried about her. She wouldn’t get into specifics but she mentioned she’s lost some weight really fast recently and asked if I’d noticed anything different about her. From the way she was talking it was obvious this isn’t a new thing and that she’s had issues with food for a while. I’d kind of guessed, it’s obvious looking at her that she doesn’t eat enough, but I guess she’s so beautiful I just didn’t think of it being a problem. Obviously it’s not good for you, but people do it all the time. S seems really worried about her and she doesn’t really have any weight to lose.

I’ve made a girl relapse into an ED based on nothing but jealousy, and I don’t even feel that bad. I can’t bring myself to. I saw her for the first time in a while the other day and she looked sick, she always sort of did but bones that were visible before were jutting out of her skin, she nearly passed out when we were out and she was shaking the whole time. If she was underweight before now she looks like she should be hospitalised. 

S is worried out of her mind and retreating from everyone else in the friend group and that’s the only thing I can bring myself to care about. I hate this. I hate being this and thinking like this. But I think I hate her more. For being so perfect and for bringing this person out of me. I hate how sick she is now and I hate that I don’t care. I hate that she’s still the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen ever half starved. I hate that I’m still jealous of her after all of that. I hate her and I hate myself and I don’t know what to do. ",0,1764773063.0,offmychest,14,0.5,False

What I like most is that it is not just one big hump of foam. The shape actually hits lower back, mid back, and that spot just under the shoulder blades, so it feels more like a gentle “back rail” than a random cushion. It is on the firmer side, but that’s what keeps it from turning into a pancake after a couple of hours. The foam has that slow rebound feel, but it does not sink to nothing.

The cover has held up really well. It feels breathable, not plasticky, and it has survived a couple of coffee related incidents after a quick wash. The strap is surprisingly useful too. It keeps the pillow in place on my slippery chair and works on my car seat when I know I have a long drive coming. No more fishing it out from behind my ribs every time I stand up.

It is not magic, I still have to remember to take breaks and move, but on long workdays, my back feels less fried by the evening. For something that just sits there and silently judges my posture all day, it has made a noticeable difference.",3,1764773008.0,DecideWise,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Indiana Hoosiers vs. Minnesota Golden Gophers: A Statistical Circus with a Side of Gopher Jokes**

The Indiana Hoosiers (7-0) roll into Minneapolis as a 10.5-point favorite, and honestly, the math checks out like a tax auditor on a coffee binge. Let’s break this down with the precision of a laser-guided free-throw (which, notably, Minnesota’s players have yet to master).

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Indiana’s Numbers Look Like a Winning Lottery Ticket

Indiana’s 50.4% field goal shooting this season is 7.3 percentage points better than the 43.1% opponents hold against Minnesota. That’s the basketball equivalent of a porcupine (Hoosiers) vs. a soggy waffle (Golden Gophers) in a contest of “who can avoid looking clumsy.” The Hoosiers also allow a paltry 62.4 points per game, while Minnesota’s offense—though decent for a team that’s lost three straight to Bay Area schools—only averages 73.5. Indiana’s defense is so stifling, it’s like watching a librarian shush a toddler’s tantrum: *inevitable* and *slightly* satisfying.

The spread of -10.5 for Indiana feels almost generous, given their 7-0 start. But let’s not forget: they’ve faced Lindenwood and Incarnate Word, teams that probably still have “freshman 15” vibes. Minnesota, meanwhile, has the consistency of a broken metronome—winning 4 of 4 at home but losing three neutral-site games to teams like Stanford and Santa Clara. Their free-throw shooting (66.7%) is so shaky, it makes you wonder if they’re all secretly auditioning for *America’s Got Talent* under the moniker “Chokers Anonymous.”

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Experience, and Why Minnesota’s Home Record Is a Statistical Fluke

Minnesota’s leading scorer, Cade Tyson, is a human highlight reel, averaging 22.4 points while using 25% of his team’s possessions. That’s like giving a toddler a bag of candy and expecting the rest of the group to survive the sugar crash. But here’s the rub: Indiana’s defense is built to suffocate star players. Tucker DeVries (17.9 PPG, 5.4 RPG) and Lamar Wilkerson (16.7 PPG) are the Hoosiers’ twin engines, and they’ve shown the discipline of a monk in a chocolate factory—no easy fouls, no easy breaks.

1pd5yfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/R4E/comments/1pd5yfq/where_is_purpose_of_life/,where is purpose of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I loved going to a bookstore, picking up something new, and dropping in for a few hours to drink coffee and read in this little alcove bay window.

1pd5xpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1pd5xpr/slow_comt_mao_may_be_the_solution/,Slow COMT? MAO may be the solution.,"It is a common problem that B vitamin supplementation, excess methyl groups, methylfolate and methylcobalamine can lead to excess catechol neurotransmitter (dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine) production and accumulation, both intracellular and extracellular.

In people with slow COMT, this can lead to neuropsychiatric symptoms of anxiety, rumination, insomnia, fatigue, a 'wired but tired' feeling, visual artifacts, as well as high estradiol and the accumulation of certain toxins. This is because the COMT enzyme can't keep up with all the extracellular catechols that need to be broken down simultaneously.

It also leads to dietary intolerance of onions, green tea, coffee, cocoa and other catechol-rich foods.

Since the COMT enzyme cannot be 'sped up' nutritionally or medically, and it operates at a fixed rate as long as there is SAMe present, the only solution that most people find for catechol accumulation is avoiding B vitamins, and avoiding problem foods.

While COMT is responsible for the breakdown of nearly all extracellular catechols in the body, there is another enzyme (or group of enzymes) - MAO-A and MAO-B - which break down dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine inside the cells, before they're even released into the extracellular space.

MAO-A and MAO-B function can be optimized significantly by Riboflavin and/or Riboflavin-5-Phosphate supplementation. By increasing MAO activity, you unburden COMT. Breaking down catecholamines intracellularly leads to less extracellular catechols release and accumulation, allowing COMT to 'catch up', promoting better mental status, stress recovery, lower estradiol and higher tolerance to foods such as onions and caffeine.

If you have your methylation system mostly taken care of by following Tawinn's [stack](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1730mw4/mthfr_a_supplement_stack_approach/), but your still struggling with slow COMT, consider supplementing Riboflavin to support your MAO enzymes.

Additional tip - this it NOT medical advice.

The drug pregabaline inhibits the extracellular release of norepinephrine by binding to specific subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels. This leaves norepinephrine to be broken down intracellularly by MAO instead of extracellularly, further unburdening COMT.

Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor, which decreases the activity of the aromatase enzyme, responsible for producing estradiol. Approximately 5% of COMT workload is directed towards breaking down catechol estrogen substrates. This percentage can be higher in women and in estrogen-dominant men. While it is not a very large amount, it can, in estradiol overload, contribute a bit further to COMT function.

Kale, broccoli, spinach and red cabbage are rich in sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol, substances that convert parent estradiol into catechol estrogens and other metabolites to be further broken down by COMT before excretion. Consuming these greens lower total estradiol (E2) but increase its metabolites.

Never take any drugs without discussing with your doctor or a qualified medical professional. Anastrozole particularly is an extremely potent AI, and 0.5mg can be enough to drop E2 to lower than healthy levels depending on your current status.",5,1764772787.0,MTHFR,1,0.86,False

I've had to explain it so many times it's maddening.

You wouldn't call sweetened ice tea out of plastic bottles or sugary milk with little actual coffee out of the same ones real tea nor coffee either right?

The most common complaint from people dislike these soda drinks is that they think it tastes like cigarette water and this is what they associate with yerba mate which puts them off trying real one.

Anyways over here it's mostly associated with young alternative/hipster /leftist types from more middle or upper class backgrounds, while coffee is an everyday drink for everyone in comparison.

What about your country!

I used to work for several years as a consultant in a high pressure environment at a big 4 company. I learned a lot there but left due to salary, social setting, job security and others.
I thought that this might be my final job until I got to know better my senior colleague who I am working with and hes training me. 
Before anything a bit of context: I am (30s m) and he is 50s m and extremely competent in his field but is socially underdeveloped even though he is a friendly and confused guy.
He is doing the following things which make me mostly angry and wasting mine and others time and seriously makes me question my choice of job:
1. constantly talking while im wearing huge headphones and trying to do online classes 
2. he is unable to answer 80% of my questions properlyand mostly asks to question him later
3. he is incredible slowly in everything except for work (eating, walking, coffee break)
4. he is constantly interrupting people while talking, doesn’t matter if in professional or private settings 
5. he never lets anyone finish their sentences
6. he is incredibly stupid if he doesn’t know something and if he asks for help he is doing everything except for what is asked (clicking around wildly like someone who never used a computer)
7. his deeds are contradictory to what he says 
8. he permanently trauma dumped me in the first weeks (always finding a way to lead any conversation to his personal tragedy)
9. he says weird things to people as he thinks he’s funny 
10. he sends out meeting invites often at lunchtime since no one has appointments then (how strange)
11. he constantly overdraws meetings and doesn’t respect others time (like not a few minutes but up to 1 fing hour!)
12. when i leave the room to go to the bathroom he doesn’t stop talking and if i wouldn’t just leave the room never stop
13. he sends out meeting invites last minute and often is late due to him talking 
14. he is extremely engaged in work and doesn’t understand that not everyone will give the same effort 

I am really not sure if he is just a overwhelmed and traumatised man who tries his best or he is a complete sociopath who does everything which is frowned upon in office culture.

I am very split since he seems to be a decent person but is so inconsiderate and annoying. I am trying to take over most meetings and bring in some structure and rules. 

My biggest question is: how do I make him listen, shut up and talk less? I will be working with him for the foreseeable future until I get my own topics so just telling him off is not an option. Also he is in the company since 30+ years and as much infamous he is needed badly for business. ",2,1764772498.0,coworkerstories,2,1.0,False

有很多事确实是这样的，我当时总觉得说这些事太狠以后拿不了美国长签证，现在有@斯奎奇大王 说了就没问题了。  
还记得我去年11.7开票之后喝酒emo发了个视频么？一方面是因为我的阶段性工作结束了如释重负，其实还有另一方面。  
另一方面就是我认识的老爷子那一周去世了三个。第一个是我经常去的一个便利店经常碰到的一对黑人老夫妇，经常是黑人老太对着老先生骂为什么不记得买XXX，老先生反过来训斥说老太太没有说清楚，不像美国白人夫妇，非常像国内的大爷大娘。前一周周四去，只看到老太太，结果被告知老先生上楼梯摔倒了脑出血，租的公寓前台在玩纸牌游戏，老先生活活在楼梯上躺了三个小时，被发现时候人已经凉了。前台没有任何责任，公寓还给老太太一家发了搬离通知，因为老先生去世给公寓造成了声望损失。  
第二个是博导很喜欢的一个学生，比我大三十多岁，是他年轻时候带的。但我一开始没见过那个学生，后来得知在八十年代纽约搞罢工，身为哥大的长聘讲师被警棍打破了头，然后整个人处于失智状态数年，恢复了之后间歇性犯病。24年在大学书店门口碰到一个胡子蓬乱衣服尚属干净的老爷子读梭罗传记，跟老爷子聊的很愉快。选举日前一周周日被导师群发邮件告知他那个很喜欢的学生不幸去世享年七十有余，看到照片才发现，就是我聊的很愉快的那个老爷子。他死于用超市买的冻鱼捶打脑袋缓解头痛。  
第三个是公司某退休大佬，老爷子脑子里可以记住各路记者政要和智库基金课题，记人名也不在话下，还是个起外号爱好者。coffee break和老爷子聊天非常享受，老头退休金也高，我的boss看他毕恭毕敬，估计地位也不低。10月中旬和老头聊天，他感叹自己这种boomer幸运，一辈子能长期在一家公司工作，而X世代基本不可能在同一家公司工作超过三年，我还有些唏嘘。两周后万圣节路过近郊，某个大豪斯门口草坪惯例插着家庭里过世者的照片，居然有这位老爷子，一瞬间觉得天旋地转。后来才知道我之所以24年能见到老头，是因为其患癌晚期，失业子女把他赶去上班，逼他多攒点钱给家里，以偿还盛年出轨辜负已去世老婆的情债。我见他半年多，老头一直大把大把吃止痛药，到最后一个月一天能吃几百片，总算给家里攒了一笔钱。到底供子女花多久？我就不知道了。  
我不喜欢把痛苦传递给别人，写美国人的遭遇我也喜欢给他们编出种种命运的眷顾。因为我看到的美国人多半还是尽力表演善良和积极的。  
但这一切，稀松平常的发生过很多次。

和他一年前评食贫道的纪录片还挺呼应：

而食贫道采访的人还有心思讨论一下自己的生活哪里出了问题，以及美国社会的核心问题是什么。让你们看看满嘴剩五颗牙，张嘴闭嘴I believe in god 的人，你们就服气了。

什么？你说为什么我看到那么多美国人日子过得不错？是，费城一套郊区好房子不过400万人民币。问题是你这一辈子不止过买房娶妻生孩子那一刻，等十年之后你被迫卖房、被绿、孩子吸上的时候， 那个痛苦会比你此刻的“压抑”和“不自由”狠的多。 而美国社会里一个人想一辈子不受苦，稳稳当当过一生，就已经打败了90%的美国人。注意，这还是美国公民享有的特权，人形外国燃料不交足入门 费享受不到的。

1pd5pjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1pd5pjd/i_didnt_expect_to_catch_feelings_at_a_coffee_shop/,I Didn’t Expect to Catch Feelings at a Coffee Shop… But Here We Are,"So this happened a few days ago, and I’m still replaying it like a movie in my head.

I stopped by this small coffee shop near my apartment one of those quiet places where you hear more keyboard clicks than actual conversations. I only went in because I needed to clear my head, not because I was expecting anything special.

I ordered my drink and looked around for a seat. The place was almost full except for one spot near the window. There was someone already sitting at the table, this girl with her hair tied up messily, headphones on, and a sketchbook open in front of her. I hesitated for a second, but she noticed and pulled out one of her earbuds.

“You can sit,” she said, smiling like it cost her nothing.

I don’t know why, but that small smile hit me harder than the caffeine ever could.

We didn’t talk at first. She went back to drawing, and I pretended to be busy on my phone. But I kept catching glimpses of her how she bit her lip while shading something, how she tilted her head when she didn’t get a line right. It wasn’t even anything dramatic… she just felt real. Warm. Relaxed. The kind of presence that makes you breathe easier without realizing it.

Eventually, curiosity won.

“What are you drawing?” I asked.

She slid the book toward me. It was the coffee shop. Not just a sketch she’d drawn the whole mood of the place. Soft lights, blurred figures, the little plants hanging in the corner. I told her it looked amazing, and she shrugged like it was nothing, even though her cheeks turned a little pink.

We ended up talking longer than I planned. About art, routines, why the world feels quieter with the right music. She told me she comes there every Tuesday morning. I told her I usually don’t, but maybe I should.

When she packed up to leave, she paused and said,

“Well, if you’re here next Tuesday, I wouldn’t mind sharing the window again.”

I swear my heart did some kind of weird flip.

She walked out, and the seat across from me suddenly felt too empty.

But in a good way like it was waiting for something.

So yeah…

Next Tuesday, I’m going back.

And maybe this time, I won’t pretend to be busy on my phone.

1pd5n1n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pd5n1n,Views from the river - Tyburn; the hidden brook of money and death. And fox dropoffs!,"Tyburn… the power of London you represent is so central, that it could never be held fully within one water basin. So as well as your [River from Hampstead to Mayfair and Westminster](https://www.reddit.com/r/riversoflondon/comments/1myt1vv/views_from_the_river_tyburn_the_hidden_river_of/), your brook shapes the city too - and Tyburnia, the place they named for you.

This is your [manor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyburn) \- and the world needs to know about it, so there's a [stone signpost](https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/find-the-tyburn-stone-12329/) telling people they're approaching the gateway to central London (or 'proper London' as you see it). Recently, you've given that a bit of a rebrand and expansion, with food and coffee at appropriate prices (you're already loaded, but it's the value they give to being in your presence - their time is indeed yummy!)

Stepping from the stone, power thrums around your brook's source - starting near the [home](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3707520.stm) of one who [commanded for a decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair), and made his efforts to guide as he sees fit ever since. Past the [promises the powerful](https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/paddingtons-glowing-greenhouse-redesigned-with-a-human-rights-message-78087/) make but are never really bound by. And watching old money (private and careful), and new (flashy, 'till they learn).

Then, as all the world zooms by around the arch and its roundabouts, three thin trees stand around a flat marker on the ground. What do they mark? Why, merely tens of thousands [hanged ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyburn#Tyburn_gallows)across six hundred and fifty years - Peter should remember you have more weapons than just an old sword.

[Others remember](https://www.tyburnconvent.org.uk/tyburn-tree), and nearby [they still mourn](https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/a-hidden-oasis-of-calm-next-to-marble-arch-10910/), remember your power and those they lost, and stand in perpetual adoration (now [livestreamed](https://adoration.tyburnconvent.org.uk/)!).

Still, time comes to step away from the bricks and tarmac, and onto the earth where your course can finally be seen in the world around you - is this what pilgrims feel? Walking a route hoping for the touch of the numinous, until the world slips into sync, and you realise yes, you are exactly where you are supposed to be, and the lanscape around you tells you that. And it's not just faith that leads one on - along the shallow valley, it leads past fountains that once drew your waters - showing believers they're in the right place.

But what's this? One of those interfering vulpines, scampering along your banks. Where can she be heading, through the grass and the trees, thinking herself so very stealthy.

Oh of bloody course, she's off to that antiquated police station. Where are [the herons](https://x.com/passedwonder/status/1496588660095037441) you set to watch that? Have they got [ideas above their station](https://x.com/MPSRoyal_Parks/status/1496769277474578433)? She tries a quick ""Oh, I'm just checking out this fancy house, maybe there's some food in their bins?"" then doubles-back through the flowers.

What is she doing there? One of their dropoffs? Whilst they're not as perfect hunters as they might wish, she's annoyingly perceptive, and notices your attention as she heads away. The station closes up like a clam.

Enough of this distraction! Down your course you head, as the [gentle glow of gaslight](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/25/londons-last-gas-street-lamps) lines the path (and the nettles), old memories make you smile as you pass a [gift](https://www.royalparks.org.uk/visit/parks/hyde-park/monuments#norwegian-war-memorial) from a Norwegian River you once spent a delightful winter with.

And finally you're down to the boathouse - oh this is where the herons have gotten themselves to, and the geese too - what is going on, down by the waterside? Still, by this point, it's Chelsea's problem - this is where you meet the Westborne, and whilst you can provide some 'older sister' advice, you're not sure she's going to listen to you as opposed to her clubbing friends and those awkward 'Quiet people'.

\---- 

It was quite a little adventure, along the banks of the Tyburn brook and through Hyde Park. Still not sure what that fox was after… nor why a tiny conker hit me in the back of the head as I was heading through the park (they didn't like being spotted?). Still, I'd seen all there was to see of the Tyburn Brook, so I rounded the Serpentine, nodded greetings to [Isis by the waterside](https://estellelovatt.com/2009/03/22/isis-by-simon-gudgeon/), and then headed out through the front entrance of the [Crystal Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Palace)

DiamondGeezer was [once again my guide for where to walk Tybrun Brook](https://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com/2010/01/westbourne-8-tyburn-brook.html), and has his own story of the river, IanVisits provided a few gems such as the Tyburn Stone (moved since his article) and more details on the Convent.

This river had much more of a gentle ""Oh, *now* I see where it was"" when I walked from Tyburn Convent across Hyde Park. There was a real moment where I went from 'roughly following a line on a map on my phone' to really seeing and feeling the way I was walking along a river valley. Much more than Beverley (who's quite obvious above ground) or the River Tyburn -  sufficiently buried and built over that you see her in the curves of streets more than dips of the land.

From a Rivers of London of London metaphysics vs Real World geology point of view, Tyburn Brook is a strange one - it shares the same name as the river, but it's a short tributary of the Wesborne (aka Chelsea), and from what I've read, the Genius Loci tend to encompass their whole water basin, so Tyburn merging into Chelsea is weird. The name means boundary stream, and was applied to the Tyburn 'Manor' (living on in [Tyburnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyburnia)) with the brook flowing through it, and the river to the west - boundaries either side, perhaps?

But the Tyburn Tree, the hanging and many other reference put the brook firmly in the hands of Lady Ty. Life and nature are complicated - and so are the nature of rivers.",42,1764772104.0,riversoflondon,7,1.0,False

so three days ago we pull into this Petro‑Can out in the Rockies. I’m outside having a smoke. Fred’s doing the classic “been holding it 200km” power‑waddle to the washroom. couple guys hanging around the doorway with coffee. some beat-to-hell Toyota Corolla squatting right next to us.

the idea hits me.

i text my kid a pic of the truck. tell him “hey,  edit the photo like a meteor blasted our front.”

kid sends it back. I’m fucking losing it.

Fred’s still not back.

honestly: I had that moment of “yeah this is a dumb idea.” if his heart quits, I’m the one paying for his wife and kid.

but then I remembered that dead fucking snake and I hit send anyway.

next thing I know: the washroom door damn near flies off the hinges.

Fred bolts for the truck. tearing across the lot. poor guy didn’t even buttoned his pants. 

bout six people watched him run to the truck, spraying shit everywhere.

no clue when he realised it was fake. I damn near died laughing by then.

it’s been 3 days, we haven’t talked since.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Detroit Pistons vs. Milwaukee Bucks: A Tale of Two Teams (and One Very Tired Ankle)**

The Detroit Pistons (17-4) and Milwaukee Bucks (9-13) collide on December 4, 2025, in a matchup that’s less “title contender vs. also-ran” and more “well-oiled machine vs. a car that’s one flat tire away from becoming a popsicle stick.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a sports bar after three pints.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Pistons as the NBA’s Version of a Swiss Army Knife

The Pistons are favored by -4.5 points, a line that reflects their dominance in point differential (+5.6 per game) and rebounding (47.0 RPG, a number so high it makes a toddler’s cereal box look modest). Their 48.6% shooting efficiency isn’t elite, but it’s enough to keep scoring above 118 points per game—imagine a toaster that can *also* brew coffee. Meanwhile, the Bucks’ 118.2 PPG looks impressive until you realize they’re allowing 118.2 PPG too, making their net rating about as useful as a screen door on a submarine.

The total is set at 230.5, and with both teams’ defenses playing like they’re in a “Guess How Many Sacks I’ll Have” contest, this one’s likely to blow past that number. The Pistons’ porous three-point shooting (they’re not a sharpshooter team) and the Bucks’ defensive ineptitude? A collision course for a points fest.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and Why Duncan Robinson’s Ankle is a Plot Twist

Detroit’s key injury story is Duncan Robinson, whose ankle is currently less reliable than a Wi-Fi connection in a subway tunnel. The sharpshooter, who’s averaging 12.6 PPG and 40.1% from deep, is questionable after a “medical evaluation” that sounds like it involved a stethoscope, a spreadsheet, and a very serious discussion about whether his foot *wants* to play. Without him, the Pistons’ offense becomes a car with one working tire—still moving, but with a lot of squeaking.

On the Bucks’ side, Giannis Antetokounmpo is back, which is like bringing a chainsaw to a knife fight. But even Giannis can’t fix a defense that’s allowing 118.2 PPG or a rol

1pd5huw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LiveMates-AE/comments/1pd5huw/why_coliving_is_the_future_of_urban_housing/,Why coliving is the future of urban housing,"Coliving didn’t appear out of nowhere. It grew out of the same quiet frustration people feel when rent keeps rising, apartments keep shrinking, and cities keep getting louder but lonelier. More people now move countries for work, come alone, stay for shorter stretches, and don’t want to lock themselves into year-long leases for a space that barely feels like home. Living by yourself stops feeling like independence at some point and starts feeling like isolation with a monthly price tag.

Look at any global city and the pattern is the same. Housing has shifted from being a necessity to feeling like a luxury product. A small apartment eats up half your income. A decent one swallows your savings. And leases demand a level of long-term certainty that most people simply don’t have anymore. Careers change, visas expire, companies close, life takes turns. Committing to an empty apartment just because that’s how it “used to work” isn’t how people want to live now.

That’s where coliving comes in. Not as some fashionable concept, but as a practical response. People started sharing not because it’s trendy, but because it makes life in expensive, high-speed cities more survivable. When you share a space, you share pressure. Rent feels lighter. Bills stop being a constant stress. And the apartment stops feeling like a box you disappear into at night.

In Dubai especially, you see this up close. People arrive from everywhere. Most come with big plans and very few connections. The city is fast, bright, and overwhelming if you face it alone. Signing a long lease often feels risky when you’re not even sure where you’ll be in six months. Coliving gives flexibility. But it also gives something else — a sense that you’re actually living in the city, not just passing through it.

What surprises a lot of people is how quickly shared housing stops being about money and starts being about comfort. Coming home to lights on. Hearing someone in the kitchen. Having someone notice if you haven’t come back yet. These things sound small until you live without them. An empty apartment can be peaceful for a while, but long term, silence gets heavy.

Work patterns have changed too. More people work remotely. More people freelance. Offices aren’t anchors anymore. Homes have become social centers whether we wanted that or not. And when your home is also where you work, live, eat, and rest, spending all of that time alone starts to wear on you. Coliving breaks that loop. It brings life back into your space.

One thing we keep noticing from people who’ve lived this way: coliving doesn’t just change where you live, it changes how you move through a city. You discover places faster. You learn what to avoid earlier. Someone tells you where not to rent, which beaches are quiet, which cafés are worth your money. This isn’t information you get from blogs. It gets passed around over coffee and late dinners.

There are patterns that appear again and again. The houses that work well usually focus more on compatibility than aesthetics. A beautiful apartment doesn’t survive clashing lifestyles. Night owls and early risers, party people and quiet workers — the mismatch matters more than design. Money creates more conflict than cleanliness ever will, so shared homes that last tend to settle finances early and clearly. And the happiest apartments usually aren’t the ones with rules posted on the fridge, but the ones where people naturally respect shared space.

Coliving changes people in ways that aren’t obvious at first. Someone arrives shy and starts hosting dinners. Someone who planned to stay six months ends up building a life. Someone meets a future business partner not through networking, but because they shared a sofa. The city feels smaller when your home has a heartbeat.

Of course, it’s not perfect. You’ll argue. Someone will forget to clean. Someone will eat your food at least once. You might swear you’ll live alone forever the day you move out. And yet, many people come back to coliving again, just in a better setup with better boundaries.

Urban housing isn’t just about shelter anymore. It’s about belonging. High-rise buildings don’t sell belonging. Contracts don’t create it. People do — slowly, awkwardly, around kitchen tables.

That’s why coliving doesn’t feel temporary. It feels like a correction. Cities became too expensive to face alone, and too interesting to live in isolation. People didn’t choose shared living because it’s fashionable. They chose it because it makes city life feel livable again.

If you’ve lived with roommates or in coliving spaces, what was it like for you? Did it change how you define “home”? And would you do it again?",1,1764771765.0,u_LiveMates-AE,0,1.0,False

We are each other’s firsts from college. Ntn was too crazy in our relationship for the first half yk the typical working things out, having our firsts together, living life. 

I do still have to confront him on this but, last night I was stalking his X (ik insecure partner thing to do I get it) bc I’ve had this hunch for MONTHS something isn’t right in our relationship. I knew something was off from behaviors sexually, personally, just all around right. Well I see he follows some woman on X and one being this goth mommy who wants men to pay her stuff right. I check her posts and her pictures and lo and behold a screenshot of somethings a man has bought her, 140$ leggings, coffee, $50 roses. I see who the gifter is and I’ll be dammed he made an account with whatever she uses to get men to pay her and he used a similar name to his X AND insta account. For a man who prided and told me how secretive and private he was… yk that’s kinda a rookie mistake imo. 

Anyways I had felt small ounces of heart break at the beginning of the relationship bc I felt like he didn’t like me and wanted to get rid of me bc of some mental stuff I dealt with, but things got super good in our relationship and recently it seemed like we were growing together despite having a month long break (I initiated around graduating college due to personal life factors and feel not connected) back in April/May 25’. 

It’s naive but the man he is I don’t think he’d cheated physically he’s a very online person and was almost incel like or made a lot of jokes pertaining to that. I am beating myself up over seeing all the signs now. I don’t want to let go and we were JUST about to get counseling together but idk if it’s even worth it atp. He’s my first love and he will prob be my first heart break. Idk how to navigate this it feels like I’ve been punched in the chest a million times over along side just feeling sick to my stomach. 

It’s not the girl’s fault on X but she does pride herself on married and taken men which is kinda ehhhh nasty for me like why would you do that. Anyways I do feel angry, sad, all the 7 grief stages all at once really. It’s such a bad time in my life too the job market sucks, I feel worse than ever, my bf obviously doesn’t love me (or soon to be ex I should say). It’s lowk so rough out here for me. 

Anyways mainly just ranting maybe for a woman who’s scared or feels there’s smth off as well (always follow intuition). If anyone has advice on letting go or first heartbreaks lmk too.

1pd5g9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1pd5g9u/healing_attachment_through_pain_7_month/,Healing attachment through pain: 7 month reflections post discard,"Mods of r/AnxiousAttachment removed this, so please enjoy the read here:



My background: After a decades long secure marriage where we unfortunately grew apart, I met my ""dream woman"" and spent 5.5 years with an unhealed dismissive avoidant. We had no idea about attachment theory or that she had issues. 2 years of a wonderful close friendship that grew into a soulmate experience, future wife material, lots of beautiful dreams that ultimately didn't materialize. 2 absolutely fantastic years together - But; Never lived together, very rare sleepovers (\~30ish total), dates were always planned and time bound - and became increasingly infrequent and shorter. I started with a very secure attachment to her for years and ended up an anxious wreck, unless I was with her and then it was only tolerable. I became fed up - demanded closeness - and was discarded.



Here were the red flags I ignored in the dating phase: 

\- Struggles with emotions - don't we all? (No)

\- Needs a lot of alone time - I enjoy my space too and didn't ask how much. It turned out to be 23 hours and 45 minutes of alone time per day.

\- Lots of short relationships where she got ""fed up"" with her partner when she was younger. I thought she outgrew it because she was married (to another DA) for almost a decade then.

\- She talked a lót of shit about her then husband who she was divorcing and I knew she was frequently lying to him. I overlooked it because the end of a relationship is never pretty, and his DA behavior did sound super shitty. Turns out I'd get exactly the same from her some years later, lying included.

\- Preferred to sleep alone. Big deal, I thought? They say it's good for sleep quality.

\- She honestly seemed like a really solid and good person with a lot of admirable qualities that matched me really well. She thought about how to make a relationship work seriously and was willing to put in the effort. She did not have other typical red flags like overwhelm or complaining about needy partners because she had mostly other avoidant partners in her past. Some support on the emotional side, giving space, and being a good partner should do the trick - is what I thought. One of the bigger mistakes in my life.



What followed though were 2 absolutely magical years. A true soulmate experience. Many of the best moments of my life were there. I could write a romance novel about how beautiful this part was and I'm glad I lived through something like that - but I do not want to repeat it. Then those magical moments became less and less frequent and I started sometimes to feel a little anxious - which I expressed as sadness and longing. She always responded to those - on text of course - and said she wished I'd be there with her too. Or just some hug emojis later. That were the start of the ""Phase of Lies"" that kept us together for another 3 years.



Before the end of the relationship I had the following symptoms from being attached to someone but deprived of my emotional needs: 

 \- Feeling neglected, unseen, unwanted and undesirable. 

 \- Heavy amount of self-doubt.

 \- Self-blame (shame) for the slow breakdown of the relationship.

 \- Low energy and low mood all the time.

 \- Poor sleep due to the anxiety.

 \- A frequent feeling she ""should"" be next to me, should sleep next to me and be physically present. It's like I was loving a ghost: always present yet unseen.

 \- Feeling incredibly lonely even in her presence and despite being otherwise surrounded by loving people. This was physically painful and cuts to your bones. Never underestimate what true loneliness does to a human being.



Obviously none of this had anything to do with me and 100% was related to her disorganized responses to intimacy. I believe avoidants are somewhere aware of the impact of you: She saw me wither and still did nothing - her own feelings, wants and needs were always more important. They can be incredibly altruistic people but still show up extremely selfishly in relationships.



After over 5 years together we were having coffee and I was trying to get closer as usual and she told me for the first time that she's really uncomfortable with me around and asked me to leave. I said that this makes no sense - especially in the context of all the lies that she wanted time with me too. But I left that day anyway, confused, anxious and alone - and still could not figure out what was going on. I could not imagine what avoidant is because it requires the avoidant to be open about their feelings which they're not gonna do, and you can only open up about your needs and hope your partner responds or leave. Three things kept me trapped from my side: I was very much holding out hope for those first 2 magical soulmate years to return. Just a bit more effort maybe? Before the relationship I was suffering from major depression and I was worried that this would come back after she left. Fortunately it did not. I had also never been single before (by simple fates of life) and had some unfortunate preconceptions ingrained deeply in me of what that is like and what it means about someone.



I got fed up somewhere here. I told my true feelings about the relationship of feeling neglected, abandoned in times of need and unseen - and I need her situation and all the reasons why she ""couldn't"" just be there for me to change. It was a simple request that a securely attached person would have done years ago - like creating space in your life and your routine for more regular closeness with the other person. I would soon find out that all ""reasons"" for not doing that were all lies and excuses that were hiding her very real issues. She had used lies trying to control me in order to keep me distant, but always in a way that I wouldn't leave her. She expertly manipulated me, but eventually I figured it out and told her my feelings as well as that I did not believe her anymore. I wanted closeness; and did not care what happened next, though I was not ready for it.



Then the deactivation happened. Her fears got the upper hand and she pushed down all her loving feelings and attachment towards me. We had discussed marriage some months earlier at her request. I have never seen someone completely flip so fast. She told me she had no loving feelings anymore and can't stay in a relationship like that. She bawled, because it was a soulmate experience for her too, but still left. We exchanged 3 items and were done: 2+5.5 years and no mixed finances, no shared routine, no toothbrushes at each others place. A couple insignificant items exchanged and she walked away.



Months 0-2 (past): Absolutely destroyed. I was already anxious from not having my attachment needs met and these feelings went into overdrive, including a huge amount of shame and doubt. I could not eat, nor sleep, nor work. I became a pale ghost of myself and lost 10kg, a lot of it muscle mass. I have faced years of major depression and severe burnout and this was on-par with those experiences in the worst stage. I moved in with my parents just to survive. The only thing that sets it apart is that it goes away pretty soon on its own, but in terms of mental suffering it's very similar. I was incredibly confused what had just happened in my life, but fortunately came into contact with attachment theory and started to obsessively study it.



Months 2-4 (past) : Managed to eat again and I had some nights of solid sleep. Still thought about my ex all the time. I mean literally non-stop for all my waking hours and had plenty of dreams and nightmares about her too. That's how strong the addiction had gotten. Cycling all stages of grief on rapidfire. Journaling helped a lot, though much of the 'loving' things I wrote were absolutely cringe. I could not simultanouesly hold the truths ""Love of my life"", ""Best relationship of my life"", ""Best time of my life"" with the  truths ""Painfully discarded"", ""Worst relationship of my life"", ""Intense suffering"" - I did not know how to integrate those. (Here's where to start: It was fun, you were really attached, but it was never true love - because that requires sacrifice from your partner and prioritizing your partner sometimes even above yourself and avoidants simply don't do that. Only you showed up for the relationship with your whole self, and they did not.)



Months 4-6 (past) : Things started to become easier, still present but lighter, work became manageable. The daily crying stopped. Attachment began to weaken and with that the symptoms seemed to gradually reduce. Worked through the self-doubt and shame and placed the blame exactly where it belonged: with her. Still wishing I were avoidant myself so I could tolerate how little she could give - a sad truth.



Months 6-7 (present) Attachment becoming weaker, sometimes almost imperceptible. Going stretches without thinking about it. Not really mad, not really sad.  Realized how much of the relationship was based on the relief I felt when she came close (which is not love), how inconsistency really messed me up and also kept me hooked. That all dreams never materialized, and that I wouldn't want to trade our attachment styles for the world. It was fun while it lasted but ultimately I stayed too long and she is the one left with a bunch of issues she refuses to work on. I improved my boundaries and worked on my side to make sure I never become trapped like that in the future.



Months 8-9 (future): Really truly feel deeply that I don't want her back 100% with every fiber of my being. It's unfortunately still not completely true, but I can easily not take any action on this. She is so thoroughly DA that I don't worry about her coming back.



Months 10-12 (future): Enjoying my life single with a calm nervous system. Peace and safety are worth so much more than whatever the avoidant provided.



Months 12+ (future): Probably might try a date at some point, try out my new avoidant-repellant boundaries, but not soon. Definitely not soon.



Realizations:



The love of your life might not be. No matter who and how much you love them, you need to love yourself more. You need, like your life depends on it, strong boundaries in how you protect yourself and your nervous system. From the way you are talked to, the way you are touched, how much someone spends time with you and prioritizes you. We need more empathy for ourselves and our needs than we do for them. Healing from a breakup is possible, thriving in a misaligned relationship is not.



Embrace your emotional needs. Spend as much time with your partner as you want. Double text, triple text, you're an adult, do what you want. ""Needy"" is just a label that avoidants slap on people whose needs they are incapable of fulfilling. Ignore dating advice, as much of it is designed not to scare off avoidants. Be open, honest, and unflinching about the kind of a relationship you want to co-create. The more clear and detailed, the better. You are giving your partner a map of how you need to be loved; This is a wonderful thing and doesn't take away the romance at all.



""When relationships break down, it is not the fault of anyone. It is the result of both people who didn't match, who argued or poorly communicated."" is a dumb myth that protects people from accountability. When one person has severe attachment issues that they don't work on, it is 100% their fault. You don't need to carry the blame and shame for this.



Love is a skill, like running, and avoidants are like a fat person trying to run. They can run a great 100 meters and you think you can run a marathon with them - until they suddenly bail on you, exhausted and can't keep up. While you definitely are marathon material and need someone to keep pace with you. That's unfortunate for them, but you need to be determined to go over that finish line.



The hardest relationships to leave are those that are perfect 50% of the time - and you never know which you're going to get tomorrow. Consistency from your partner is vital for your nervous system to stay calm and regulated. If you stay with an inconsistent partner, you will eventually become addicted - prepare to suffer the rest of your life or prepare for the breakup from hell.



You will not get closure or accountability from them. You will have to create your own explanations for what just happened in your life. Look critically at yourself and why you didn't walk away sooner, but not more than that. Avoidants really challenge you in relationships to the extreme and having some anxious behaviors sometimes in response to that is completely normal - and does not give you part of the guilt of the relationship breaking down. I bet at least half of the r/AnxiousAttachment subreddit are only there because of their experiences with an avoidant and if they were with someone securely attached who prioritized them and their needs consistently, they wouldn't even have an issue.



If you believe in fate, the avoidant came into your life to put you on a path to prepare you for the best relationship you will ever have. It challenged you to the point of breakdown, but you learned so much. That was the purpose of the relationship: A lesson on love, on how to be an adult in a secure relationship, and never settle for less than you deserve. Learn the lesson and move on.

Not dramatic, not heartbreaking. Just heavy. The kind of heaviness that sits in your chest for no obvious reason. And instead of pretending it wasn’t there, I actually let myself feel it.

I didn’t get much done this morning. I opened Jobcat, stared at a few listings, and closed it because my brain immediately went nope not today. A few months ago I would’ve freaked out about that. I would’ve told myself I was falling behind or messing up again. But today, I just let it be what it was.

I made coffee, sat on the floor like an unbothered gremlin because the couch felt too formal, and let myself breathe. I reminded myself that not every day has to be a pushing forward day. Sometimes just staying upright is enough. Sometimes just not giving up is enough.

Eventually, I sent one application. Just one. And weirdly, I felt proud of it. Proud in that small quiet way where you know you didn’t have it in you to do more, but you still showed up anyway. Nothing about today was impressive. But it was real. And being real feels like its own kind of progress.",1,1764771637.0,30daysnewjob,0,1.0,False

1pd5ev1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialWorkStudents/comments/1pd5ev1/my_program_keeps_pushing_to_have_current_students/,"my program keeps pushing to have current students help boost admissions, but i don't think anyone should get their BSW here","I am a senior BSW student wrapping up my second to last semester so this is really more of a vent than anything, but I am running into the recurring issue of staff expecting current students to participate in admissions activities and such to try to draw in more students- but I have had a terrible experience at this school and don't want to be morally responsible for anyone choosing to pursue their degree here. The only option we were given for work from home field hours (to make up for severe weather shutting down roads, sick days, etc) were preparation for these events and I ended up choosing to do extra long days at field instead because I just can't stomach lying and trying to talk to students about why this is the school for them when I'm running away from this program screaming. 

All of the professors that were here when I started are gone and have been replaced. We currently only have two professors for the whole department and the second one was hired on the first day of this semester. This woman is primarily the reason that I am so disappointed in this school. Initially they told us this was her first time teaching ever so I felt a bit bad for her, but this isn't even true and this is actually her THIRD semester. Yesterday I had my final field meeting with my supervisor and the professor was supposed to zoom in. I'll admit that I'm a little more intimidated by my supervisor than I should be but she has a pretty high position not just in the agency but the county and I really respect her. So when my professor zooms in from her phone in bed wearing Christmas pajamas, hair unbrushed, eating breakfast, and without any of the documents or paperwork to discuss I wanted to scream. My supervisor hung up and goes, how has she not improved at all from the beginning of the semester. She supervises other students from my program (and has worked with my school doing this for over 10 years) as well so she has to do these meetings with her for each student and said she has been blown away by this woman's whole... method of doing things. 

Those of us who have class with her have received multiple anonymous surveys we were asked to fill out to ""improve her class because she knows that many of us are unhappy"". Nothing has changed at all. It is supposed to be a 9-12 class but we have not once been there past 10:30. On top of this she is late every day (with a coffee in her hands) then takes another several minutes to set up the computer/projector, so we start class at least 10 minutes late each day. She insist on giving us a 15 minute break, which we all put in the feedback was unnecessary if class was going to be so short, and she is the only one who leaves the room for the 15 minutes. She also takes at least one, but usually two, of her own additional bathroom breaks. So the majority of class is us just sitting there staring at each other waiting on her. There has been so much miscommunication about assignments. She told us in class several times that we were not going to do one of the papers on the syllabus and then sends us an email with a due date for the paper because she later said she forgot she told us not to do it -- then didn't answer any immediate follow up emails she got asking why there was now a due date, so several students scrambled to get it done thinking they made the mistake. She hasn't answered over half of the emails that I have sent her and this is the same for all of my classmates.

The other professor in our program reached out to me to meet to talk about what class has been like because the influx of complaint has been so heavy and I was one she hadn't heard from yet. She was over 30 minutes late with no heads up and again nothing has changed. I feel really disheartened by the attitude I've seen and while I know a lot of it is understaffing I am exhausted with how difficult it is for any of this to function. Students have repeatedly had to pick up slack from professors because when they call out sick or have emergencies there is no one else to cover for them, so one girl was asked to finish a presentation for a diversity event the day before for our professor because she got sick and didn't have it ready; which is far from the first time this has happened. And then the student had to give the presentation as well. It takes at least a week to get an email back from anybody if you're lucky enough to get a response. It would be one thing if this was like a giant state school but there are 15 of us in my graduating BSW class. The entire message they peddle to us when coming to this school/program is close relationship with professors and teacher to student ratio but right now trying to contact any of them is about as effective as throwing your phone into the ocean. All 15 of us are not only fed up but also being asked to help advocate and recruit students for an additional online program they want to pilot but they can't even run an in-person one right now. Many of us in our senior field placement are significantly short on hours and finishing a week late because staff, which they regularly admit to and had to extend the deadline for, made so many mistakes with student clearances and paperwork that we were not able to start at the usual time. Our annual campus wide mental health awareness event was cancelled the day before because staff that was supposed to present waited until last minute to say that they could no longer be there for a variety of different reasons like my favorite one that I was told, ""I just don't know if I feel up for it this week.""

I think the best example of the issue I can give is the last time I met with prospective students and their parents. Professor tells parents, this is the type of school where teachers know their students and want to support them, blah blah, personal connections, then tries to drive it home by saying ""I even know all of my students dogs names. Like raspberrysquirrels dogs name is...... actually she doesn't have a dog."" Yes, I do have a dog. It's all surface level.

Basically, I regret getting talked out of transferring and should have followed my gut. Now I have to stand by and watch these oblivious high school seniors fall into the same trap that I did.",3,1764771574.0,SocialWorkStudents,2,1.0,False
