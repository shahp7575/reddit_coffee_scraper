So I own a dedica and a kingrinder k2 which i use to make espresso for my daily cappuccino and have (imo) quite good equipment
 But today i already had a cappuccino in the morning and was craving another cup but I knew that if I had one more, i won't be able to sleep tonight properly so i grabbed a sachet of sleepy owl vanilla which my dad had got for him self and my mom(they hate my elaborate coffee)

And OMFG when I added it to milk and sugar, it tasted heavenly and perfectly satiated me

Altho that doesn't mean il stop making my cappuccino, I think I might consider this as a 2nd cup of the day as I think it has less caffeine (correct me if I'm wrong)

Also, I think I liked this so much bcoz it was flavoured, I usually hate any flavours in my cappuccino but for some reason I love it in instant. ",1,1754893252.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The modern creamer dispenser incorporates several key features designed to enhance functionality and user experience.

**Capacity:** Capacity is a crucial factor depending on needs. Models range from single-serving dispensers holding a few ounces to large-capacity units capable of storing several liters. Small dispensers, frequently enough around 12-16 ounces, suit home use or small offices. Larger dispensers ranging from 1 liter to 3 liters are ideal for busy cafes, restaurants, or large office environments where frequent refilling is impractical. The ability to gauge the remaining volume, either through transparent walls or fill level indicators, is also important for efficient management.

**dispensing Mechanism:** The dispensing mechanism greatly affects ease of use and precision. Pump dispensers are common, offering measured portions with each press. Some pumps allow for adjustable portion sizes, catering to individual preferences. Electric dispensers offer touchless operation, promoting hygiene and convenience with a simple wave of the hand. Other mechanical options include lever-action dispensers,which provide smooth and controlled flow,and gravity-fed models relying on tilt or valve systems for dispensing. The material and construction of the dispensing mechanism determine durability and resistance to clogging.

**Temperature Control:** Certain premium creamer dispensers feature temperature control capabilities. Refrigerated models maintain a consistent, cool temperature, preserving the freshness and quality of the creamer for extended periods. These often utilize thermoelectric cooling systems or require ice packs. insulated models, on the other hand, do not actively cool but help to maintain a stable temperature, preventing creamer from warming up too quickly. Temperature control is particularly beneficial in environments where creamer is dispensed over long durations or where sanitation is a priority.

**Material and Construction:** the material composition of a creamer dispenser impacts its durability, hygiene, and aesthetics. Stainless steel dispensers are popular for their robustness, resistance to corrosion, and sleek appearance. Plastic dispensers, typically constructed from BPA-free polymers, offer a lighter weight and cost-effective option. Glass dispensers provide a premium look and feel, but require careful handling. Construction quality focuses on tight seals to prevent leaks, sturdy bases to ensure stability, and easy-to-clean surfaces to maintain sanitation standards.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Maintaining hygiene is paramount when dealing with dairy products. Creamer dispensers should be designed for easy disassembly and cleaning. Parts should be dishwasher-safe where possible or easily accessible for manual washing. Features such as wide openings,smooth interior surfaces,and removable dispensing mechanisms simplify the cleaning process. Some dispensers have self-cleaning functions that employ internal jets or sanitizing cycles.Regular cleaning is crucial to prevent bacterial growth and ensure food safety.

Key Features also include:

* Adjustable portion control
* Airtight sealing to preserve freshness
* Anti-drip design to prevent messes
* Dishwasher-safe components
* BPA-free materials

## Core Benefits

The use of a dedicated creamer dispenser provides several notable benefits over traditional methods of serving cream or milk.

**Improved Hygiene:** Creamer dispensers significantly reduce the risk of contamination associated with open pitchers or shared containers.by providing a sealed and controlled dispensing system, they prevent the introduction of bacteria, spills, and unwanted particles into the creamer. This is especially critically important in public settings where multiple individuals are using the same dispenser, promoting a healthier and more sanitary habitat.

**Enhanced Portion Control:** Dispensing precise portions of creamer helps to reduce waste and ensures consistent flavor in every cup of coffee or tea. Manny creamer dispensers offer adjustable portion sizes, allowing users to customize their servings based on individual preferences. This not only minimizes unnecessary usage but also helps to control costs and avoid over- or under-sweetening beverages.

**Increased Convenience:** Creamer dispensers offer unparalleled convenience, especially in busy environments where quick and easy access to creamer is essential. They eliminate the need to pour from bulky containers or manage individual creamer packets, streamlining the coffee preparation process. Electric touchless dispensers further enhance this convenience with hands-free operation, reducing the risk of cross-contamination.

**Preservation of Freshness:** Airtight creamer dispensers help to maintain the freshness and quality of the creamer for longer periods. By minimizing exposure to air and light, they prevent oxidation and bacterial growth, ensuring that the creamer stays fresh and flavorful. Refrigerated models further extend shelf life by keeping the creamer at a consistently cool temperature, ideal for environments where creamer is not used promptly.**Professional Appearance:** A dedicated creamer dispenser adds a touch of professionalism to any coffee station, whether in an office, restaurant, or home setting. It presents a clean and organized appearance, enhancing the overall coffee experience. Stainless steel dispensers, in particular, exude a sense of sophistication and durability, impressing clients and creating a more appealing environment.

**Are creamer dispensers suitable for non-dairy alternatives?**
Yes, most creamer dispensers can be used with non-dairy alternatives like almond milk, soy milk, or oat milk.

Clean the dispenser more frequently when using non-dairy options, as some may be more prone to causing buildup.

**What is the lifespan of a typical creamer dispenser?**
The lifespan of a creamer dispenser depends on the build quality, frequency of use, and maintenance. stainless steel dispensers generally last longer than plastic models due to their durability and resistance to corrosion.

1mn5g5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethelcain/comments/1mn5g5t/tempest_my_interpretation_of_what_happened_to/,tempest & my interpretation of what happened to willoughby,"okay so i’ve already seen tons of theories based off this new album and i wanted to throw my hat into the ring. most people seem to be convinced he’s dead (though i’m pretty certain hayden has said he isn’t dead multiple times), but i’m of the belief he simply left, and “tempest” is the culmination of the reasons why.

first off, his abusive father. it’s mentioned multiple times throughout the album and confirmed in hayden’s genius annotations that willoughby’s father is a vietnam war vet with ptsd and takes it on out willoughby.

second, his absent mother. this is where “tempest” starts to come in. in hayden’s genius annotations, she confirms the lines “‘I can lead you to bed / But I can’t make you sleep’ / I’ve heard it before / From someone who leaves” are about willoughby’s mother who left years before. presumably she left to escape willoughby’s father’s abuse, but in “a house in nebraska”, it’s mentioned that she still calls ethel to ask her how she’s doing, so seemingly she still tries to stay in his life to a degree.

third, a potential deceased friend? take this one with a grain of salt, but in “a knock at the door” there are the lines “No one should ever see their friend / They’ve known since they were just kids / Foam up and bite it on the floor”. upon first listen, i assumed this was about ethel witnessing willoughby’s abuse at the hands of his father, but others have said they interpreted this to be willoughby telling ethel about seeing a friend overdose and (potentially?) die.

fourth, obviously ethel. she’s one of the few things he has in this town, if not the only thing. it’s hard to tell what his perception of their relationship is since we’re mostly seeing it from ethel’s overly romanticized perspective, but i’m assuming he does love ethel as much as she loves him, but is more “down to earth” about it if that makes sense. (the lines “I’ve been picking names for our children / You’ve been wondering how you’re gonna feed them” in “waco, texas” are somewhat indicative of this.)

now we get to “tempest”, which retells the night of the tornado hitting the town. we already know from “dust bowl” (“Pretty boy / Scared of the rain, by God”) and as is confirmed in hayden’s genius annotations, that willoughby is terrified of the weather, which is very important context for what follows.

“Can you hear them? / The trains”

i’ve seen people assume this about willoughby leaving on a train, and while it could have a double meaning, i think it’s moreso referring to the sound of the tornado since they’re known for sounding like trains.

“I’ll hurt myself if I want / I don’t care”

ethel is trying to comfort him, but since he’s usually the one needing to comfort her, she’s not used to this and can only offer generic platitudes. he can feel that she’s moreso going through the motions while not actually seeing him for all he is outside of the “savior” image she has of him, so he begins pushing back on what she’s telling him.

“Do you swing from your neck / With the hope someone cares?”

hayden’s genius annotation: Willoughby taunts Ethel with the same sentiments echoed on Family Tree (Intro), asking if she wears the curse of her lineage so openly in a bid for sympathy or rescue.

ethel has a tendency for dramatics (“Made a fool of myself down on Tennessee Street / It wasn’t pretty like the movies / It was ugly, like what they all did to me” from “nettles” as just one example), and willoughby has had to calm her down and comfort her many times i’m sure, and now the one time he needs the same, she can’t offer it. he’s becoming overwhelmed and snaps at her in the heat of the moment.

“Please, just go easy on me / I am young and naive / I don’t know what I need”

now ethel is upset at him, and he feels bad about what he just said, and begins to backtrack. he isn’t even sure what he wants her to do, he’s never really been in this situation before. the idea of willoughby as this savior who is always strong and never afraid begins to slip further.

“Don’t ask me why I hate myself / As I’m circling the drain”

as he begins to panic more, ethel drops the act of consoling him and argues with him more, which obviously makes willoughby feel even worse.

“Waiting on my own / Always on my own”

at this point, ethel “left him curled between the couch and the coffee table when it all got too loud” as per the page we have from “diary of a preacher’s daughter”. willoughby is on his own now, and begins to realize that to some extent, he’s always felt alone, even in his relationship with ethel.

“You came around here just to watch me writhe / Am I what you think about all late at night? / You can try and stop me, hold me / Do all the things that you do / But it’s no good”

it sets in for willoughby that the dynamic of ethel as this sort of “damsel in distress” and himself as her hero has fallen apart. he inevitably showed her his weaknesses and in response, she abandoned him.

after all this, he knows their relationship can’t continue. this betrayal was just too much. the façade has shattered into a million pieces, unsalvageable. maybe it was toxic from the start. ethel was the last thing keeping him in shady grove. now he has nothing left, so he leaves. (my headcanon is that he left to waco, texas. to be clear, hayden said on her tumblr that the song name is actually a reference to the branch davidians standoff which occurred in waco but let me have this headcanon!)

ethel can’t understand why this made him leave. she knew their argument was bad, but she didn’t see it as “i’m skipping town and never speaking to you again” levels of bad. at the same time, she blames herself entirely (“And it hurts to miss you, but it's worse to know / That I'm the reason you won't come home”) when there were other factors at play.

while maybe this isn’t the most satisfactory answer, i’ve seen a lot of people saying album doesn’t explain why he left, but in my opinion it pretty much did. i doubt we’ll get a play-by-play of the night he left and the aftermath until the book drops, but for now i think this is the gist of it.

Before my aunt and uncle left, they told me she had been sick earlier thay day but was feeling fine and just let her eat the snacks they had brought for her. Okay, no biggie... We watched tv and played Candy Land a couple of times before she wanted a snack, so i went into her bag and pulled out the snacks her parents had packed for her hot Cheetos and a Coke. Okay sure fine I handed her the coke, and I opened the bag for her before going into the kitchen to get myself a bowl of grapes.


Cousin-What are those?




Me- Grapes?


Cousin- Can i have one?


Me- Sure


Cousin- Oh! Those are good!


Me- Do you want a small bowl?


Cousin-Yes please 
So i got up and made her a bowl of grapes, and we watched something on the Disney channel her Hot Cheetos all but forgotten on the coffee table. Fast forward a couple of hours, my cousin passed out on the couch, and both bowls with grape stems arw sitting on the coffee table with the bag of hot cheetos 


Aunt- Did you have fun with your cousin?


Cousin-Yes! She let me try grapes
Aunt- Oh!
 She puts my cousin down and walks over to me 


Aunt -"" You gave her grapes!?"" She hissed at me


Me-"" Um... Yeah? I didn't realize.... Is she not supposed to..."" I sputtered, hoping I hadn't just messed up in a major way



Aunt- YOU KNOW THEY MAKE WINE OUT OF THAT RIGHT!?


Me- What?


Aunt-WINE YOU KNOW THAT THING THAT MAKES YOU DRUNK!?


Me -"" You're joking, right?"" I laughed, thinking it was a joke


Aunt- This isn't funny. im telling your grandfather!


Me- Okay



She packed her stuff and left. The next day, my grandfather called and asked me what had happened. i tell him, and he just groans and hangs up.
My aunt then calls


Aunt- So do you have something to say to me?

Me- Um, not really


Aunt- Really? 


Me - Yes, really.


Aunt- You could've gotten your cousin drunk!


Me - First off, its fruit second it has to go through a whole fermentation process to become wine!



Aunt- youre a liar!


Me - what next you're going to tell me she doesn't eat apples because they can make beer out of it!?



Aunt- silence

When we met he had this old beaten down truck with the window busted out it used to bug me so much and he had been promising to get it fixed but he never did. The truck kept braking down and it left him totally dependent on me to get anywhere. I’ve towed the truck for him multiple times. It broke down for good about 4 months ago and he doesn’t even talk about getting it fixed anymore. I drive him to and from where he needs to go and that seems to be good enough for him. 

He has constant money troubles on my birthday this year he wanted to take me out but forgot to pay his utilities and had to fork over 200$ for them to be turned on so we didn’t do anything special. 

His old job shorted him a paycheck and he’s not even making any commotion to get that money. I just feel like he’s so dependent on me. 

I buy all our groceries and I always get myself a pack of sodas to have for a few weeks and he’ll drink them all in three days. If I buy a box of chips to take to work he eats all the good ones and leaves the ones he doesn’t like for me. 

I don’t eat meat but I always buy him those logs of meat from Sam’s or Costco that cost like 50$ and he says he’ll pay me back but he never really does. 

If I want a 5$ coffee drink it’s too expensive for him. Relationships aren’t all about money but I feel like I’m funding his whole life right now it puts a lot of pressure on me then he will come into money and spend it on stuff he doesn’t even need. 

A few weeks ago I broke down telling him how I feel like he’s so stagnant and he’s in the same place he was a year ago. I told him how much pressure he puts on me to provide for him when I shouldn’t have to do that. I’m fine dating someone who doesn’t have much but it’s like I’m expected to provide for him at this point. 

Since then he hasn’t even talked about getting his truck fixed or trying to get his last check from his job!

1mn59mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Reflectionphotos/comments/1mn59mk/why_your_newborn_session_shouldnt_happen_in_your/,Why Your Newborn Session Shouldn’t Happen in Your Living Room (No Offence),"I love a cozy couch and a good messy bun just as much as the next mom. But when it comes to newborn photography, your living room might not be the peaceful, photo-ready space you’re imagining. No offence, of course.

As a Niagara [**newborn photographer**](https://www.reflections.photo/newborn-photography-services) (and a mom of four), I totally understand the appeal of an at-home session. No packing up the diaper bag, no wrestling the car seat, no worrying about how your baby will do in a new space. But the truth is, your living room wasn’t designed for newborn photography. My studio is. Choosing a professional studio gives you a calmer experience and truly beautiful results. Here’s why:  
**1. Real Talk: Home Is Where the Clutter Lives**

Unless you’ve found the time to declutter and deep-clean postpartum (please teach me how), chances are your home is a little chaotic right now. Think laundry baskets, bottles drying on the counter, a swing in the doorway, and maybe a visiting grandparent or two.

At the studio, everything is already styled and ready. It’s a clean, neutral space filled with soft textures and timeless details that keep the focus on your baby, not the background.

# 2. Lighting Matters (And Your Windows Might Not Help)

Natural light can be beautiful when it works. Most homes don’t have the right light for soft, consistent newborn photography.

My Niagara studio was built with this in mind. It features floor-to-ceiling windows and special window fabrics to get that clean, even light all day long. I have full control over shadows and contrast, so no matter the weather or time of day, your photos will still have that soft, natural look you love.

# 3. Babies Love Warmth (But Not a Hot Furnace)

Newborns need a warm, cozy space to stay sleepy and settled during their session. But cranking your thermostat at home doesn’t always cut it.

In my studio, the temperature is always baby-safe and warm, just right for swaddled poses, without making the rest of your family overheat.

# 4. Everything You Need Is Already Here

You don’t need to order props, dig out baskets, or figure out what your baby should wear. I’ve got you covered with a curated selection of wraps, outfits, and accessories, beautiful cozy furniture for family portraits, and all the essentials for newborn posing and safety. You just show up with your baby. I take care of the rest.

# 5. Less Noise, More Calm

At home, your baby might be trying to nap while the dog barks, your toddler builds a block tower nearby, or someone microwaves a coffee for the third time.

My studio is designed for peace and quiet. It’s a calm, distraction-free space that helps babies settle more easily and keeps the session running smoothly.

# 6. Designed for Tired Parents Too

You’re already doing so much. A studio session means no prep, no cleaning, and no pressure.

Here’s what’s waiting for you when you arrive: a quiet feeding area, a stocked change table, space to take breaks and catch your breath, and a photographer who’s been through this stage and knows how to keep things relaxed. You don’t have to clean the house or put on a show. Just come as you are. I’ll handle the rest.  
**The Bottom Line: It’s About Giving You the Best**

This isn’t about judging your living room. Mine has seen its fair share of chaos too. This is about making sure your newborn session is everything it should be: calm, beautiful, and stress-free.

As a Niagara newborn photographer, my studio was built with your family in mind. I want you to walk away with photographs that feel like you, but even better.

1mn59h0,https://i.redd.it/8dk9ip960cif1.jpeg,"Ratomir Rade Hamović (Rogami, near Stoč, 13 February 1916 – Ljubljana, 19 May 2009) – participant in the People's Liberation War, Colonel General of the Yugoslav People's Army, People's Hero of Yugoslavia. From 16 June 1961 to 15 June 1967 – Chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav People's Army.","Rade's ancestors moved from Durmitor to the village of Do in the Stolac area around 1840. The Hamovićs adapted well to their new life and by World War I they had become one of the richest families in the town, owning two houses, one of which was considered the most beautiful.

Rade was born on 13 February 1916 in the village of Rogami, near Stolac, to Milan and Saveta. In his autobiography, Captain Rade from Romania, he writes that his father Milan was the business brains of the family. During World War I, he became rich by trading coffee and food products with the approval of the Austro-Hungarian government.

He graduated from primary school in his native village, high school in Sarajevo and the Military Academy in Belgrade in 1936, becoming one of the top ten students in his class, which allowed him to serve in any garrison of his choice. Rade chose to serve in the Petrovgrad (now Zrenjanin) garrison in the 25th Infantry Regiment, named after the Romanian King Ferdinand I. After a bar fight, Rade Hamović was transferred from Zrenjanin to the infantry officers' rifle school in Sarajevo, where from 1938 to 1941, as a junior lieutenant, he was a platoon commander in the training battalion.

While serving in Sarajevo, he joined the Sarajevo youth organization and participated in some of its activities.

During the German attack on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, he served as quartermaster of the 60th Infantry Regiment in Derventa. After the capitulation of the Yugoslav Royal Army, he managed to escape capture and return to his homeland.

Rade contacted Svetozar Vukmanović Tempo and Hasan Brkić, who were then organizing preparations for an uprising in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the end of July 1941, Rade went to Romania and became chief of staff of the Romanian NOP detachment. Together with the detachment commander Slaviš Vajner Čić, he planned and led an attack on the Ustaše stronghold in Sokoč.

In October 1941, Rade was appointed commander of the NOP detachment ""Kalinovići"", operating in the Sarajevo-Foča sector. On 15 October 1941, he became a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPY). After a series of successful battles against the enemy, by the decision of the Supreme Headquarters of the People's Liberation Partisan and Volunteer Army of Yugoslavia (NLP and DVJ) on May 6, 1942, Rade Hamović was elected a member of the Supreme Headquarters, a position he held until the end of the war.

In mid-1942, he and his unit moved to Central Bosnia and was soon appointed Chief of Staff and then Commander of the 10th Herzegovinian Shock Brigade. Having defeated the garrison in Prozor and captured Rama, Hamović and the 10th Herzegovinian Brigade attacked the German troops pressing back the 5th Proletarian (Montenegrin) Brigade.

During the National Liberation War, Rade Hamović held the following positions:

Chief of Staff of the Partisan Detachment ""Romanija"" (1941),
Commander of the Partisan Detachment ""Kalinovica"" (1941),
Member of the Supreme Staff of the NOP and DVJ (6 May 1942),
Chief of Staff and then Commander of the 10th Shock Brigade ""Herzegovina"" (8 August 1942),
Chief of Staff of the 29th Herzegovinian Division since December 1943.
Chief of Staff of the 2nd Shock Corps of the NOVJ since July 1944.
Chief of the Operational Department of the General Staff of the NOP and PO BiH since September 1944.
Delegate of the Supreme Staff on the Srem Front. As a delegate of the Supreme. 

Immediately after the war ended, Rada Khamovich continued to work as the chief of operational department of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army. During this period, he solved numerous problems and eliminated threats to the country's security, such as the elimination of the remnants of enemy formations of the Second World War, the Civil War in Greece, pressure from the MB, the Trieste crisis, American military assistance and the Balkan association with Greece and Turkey. On behalf of the Yugoslav Army (Yua), he said goodbye to Velimir Yakich at his funeral in October 1946.

From 1952 to 1956, he was the commander of the 3rd Army Military District in Skopier, and from 1956 to 1961 he was transferred to the post of commander of the 5th Army District in Zagreb. From 1965, until retirement, he was a member of the authorized Central Committee of the Yugoslav People's Army for the Yugoslav People's Army.

From June 16, 1961 to June 15, 1967, he served as chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav People's Army. Then he held the position of chief inspector of the Yugoslav People's Army until September 30, 1968, when he was ahead of schedule resigned the rank of lieutenant General of the Yugoslav People's Army. The reason for his resignation was his resistance to mobilization in Yugoslavia during the Czechoslovak crisis in August 1968, since he considered the mobilization of a very expensive operation and believed that Yugoslavia did not threaten the intervention of the Warsaw Treaty. He was right, but in vain. The injustice towards him was never eliminated.

In addition to military service, he was elected as a deputy of the national buying up of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was a member of the National Defense Council and the Main Council of the SSRN of Yugoslavia.

He was engaged in military journalism, headed the Yugoslav editorial office of the Belgrade Operation (Belgrade/Moscow, 1964).

In 1944, he was awarded the title of Major General, in 1947-Lieutenant General, and in 1955-Colonel General of the Yugoslav People's Army.

He died on May 19, 2009 in Ljubljana.",1,1754892427.0,HeroesofYugoslavia,0,1.0,False

I worked at Dutch for almost 10 months. I loved it despite it being stressful, I even was up for becoming a shift lead. I loved my co workers and regulars. And even when things were difficult. I was so dedicated and I felt like I was growing so much. 

Around this March, we got a new operator and there were big changes being made. I was extremely stressed out and depressed. 

Soon I got what I thought was a big opportunity at a local coffee shop. Unfortunately it didn’t work out and I had to leave abruptly. 

Its been 4 months since I’ve left Dutch and i really want to go back. 

About a month ago I emailed my former manager and they told me that that stand was fully staffed. I ended up sending a follow up email to let the management team know that I’d be willing to wait for an opening. Unfortunately I made the mistake of emailing the operator and was told I’d have to go through the formal application process as a result.

I know I made a mistake and I can’t help but feel like it might be held against me.  

I just really missed working there, it brought out the best in me and shed light on aspects of me that needed growth. I hope it’s not the end of that chapter for me but I think I’ll have to move on. If you have been through something similar please share.

1mn577b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeRoasting/comments/1mn577b/using_tech_to_connect_the_coffeecocoa_value_chain/,Using tech to connect the coffee/cocoa value chain - what certifications are needed for a digital marketplace?,"Hi everyone,

I have built a digital marketplace (currently in beta) and am in the process of onboarding coffee farmers in Nigeria. We will be doing some sample runs soon, but before registering in Canada, I want to make sure I am pursuing the right certifications for selling roasted, ground, and green coffee to cafés, roasters, and other buyers.

I am not a logistics company or an importer/wholesaler, but a digital marketplace. The platform connects different parts of the coffee/cocoa value chain, including farmers, processors, buyers, logistics and payments, while promoting transparency, access to market, and better flow of information so producers can grow more and earn more.

We are starting with Nigeria, then scaling to other origins. I know Nigeria is not the first country that comes to mind for coffee, but it does produce, and there is real potential for it to become a bigger player. In cocoa, Nigeria is already a top producer, but smallholder farmers still face big market access gaps. Africa as a whole has massive potential both in cocoa (producing 70% of the world's cocoa) and coffee (producing 12% of the world's coffee), and has 60% of the world's arable land, but farmers often lack access to global markets or insight into what buyers need. With the right technology and relationships, that gap can be closed.

**My question: For roasted, ground, and green coffee coming into Canada (and potentially the US/UK/EU later), what certifications or inspections are actually needed to sell to cafés and other buyers as a digital marketplace? I have done some research, but I want to hear from those with hands-on experience/knowledge.**

Also, on a separate note, would anyone here be interested in signing up for samples when we are ready? Just gauging curiosity at this stage.

FLAMES WE PLAY WITH [3k] 

I never got to tell him that I loved him. Not when we were in college, not when he left, and not when I gave him an ending he never asked for.

Exactly one month before I was supposed to move out of this crappy place, somebody lit a fire in my one bedroom apartment at Darren heights. Within minutes, everything was covered in roaring red-orange flames. From the kerosene-soaked floor to the white stone ceiling. From the clothes in my closet to the half eaten pack of cereal I left on my kitchen counter. In the end all that remained was smoke and ash. 

And coincidentally that one picture of me and my ex-boyfriend I could never bring myself to throw away. It had blackened on the edges and fallen out from its frame, but the smiling faces of the two of us in front of Victoria Falls were perfectly sustained. Almost as if it was indestructible. Or someone wanted it to survive all along. 

Nobody saw anyone enter or leave the apartment that morning. But shortly after eleven, my neighbour, Alice, a woman in her mid-twenties, saw smoke coming out my windows, and below the front door. Immediately she called the fire department. But it was already too late to save any furniture or personal belongings. 

Except, of course, the apparently ‘fire resistant’ photograph. 

According to the fireman the photograph was lying in a plastic bag, right at the doorstep of the apartment on top of the slightly burnt welcome mat, instead of in its frame on my night stand. How did it get there? Nobody could tell. There were no fingerprints on the bag, or the doorknob. Every item inside was burnt to a crisp. It was the perfect arson, the kind only someone truly meticulous could carry out.

I was at work, when I got the call that my place had literally been swallowed by flames. I hurried home, abandoning my meeting with an international client, only to find the door sealed off. The air inside was so thick with smoke that nobody without an oxygen mask was allowed to enter. 

“Selena, Oh My God, I don't understand how this could happen!” Alice rushed towards me as soon as she saw me trying to force my way inside. Two firemen stopped us.

A few other neighbours had also gathered around, trying to figure out what all the fuss was about. Their whispers spread through the crowd faster than the smoke. They looked at me with judgey eyes as if I myself had set the fire. 

In the midst of the commotion, I could do nothing but stand there, unmoving, like a statue. I had lost almost every single thing that belonged to me. The oak dresser my grandmother owned once, the silk scarf from Paris, the photo albums from school and even the engagement ring that my fiance had gotten me just last week. Everything had been reduced to nothing but grey ash. 

“They said this was lying at your doorstep” Alice handed me a photograph, still wrapped safely inside the plastic bag. I grabbed it in a flash, hoping at least one good memory might have been spared. But one look at it and my expression turned from remorseful to angered. I clenched my fist tight. 
My breath grew heavier, and I forced myself to stay upright, although my body seemed hell bent on letting me collapse. I knew exactly who did this. 

Someone who had always hated seeing me happy. Someone I met and fell in love with at Yale, almost five years ago. The biggest mistake of my life.

Jordan Stiler. He was my senior at Yale. We had been together for almost a year before — well before I came to my senses and found out what kind of a person he actually was. 

“Ma'am are you the owner of this apartment?” A broad-shouldered man in uniform, badge gleaming at his side, asked me, as he made his way outside after examining almost every inch. 

“Yes, Selena Franklin. What happened, Sir?” I asked, my fingers clinging tightly onto my friend’s hand, and my limbs weary. 

“Hi, I am Detective Daniel Gills, NYPD. I was the first one to inspect the scene, after the fire was put off.” They already called the NYPD? The firemen sure were quick. He put forward his hand, and I shook it in a haze. “We can't tell what really happened here. But this was no accident. Someone lit the match and it spread everywhere. Do you know anyone who could have such a motive against you, Ms Franklin?” 

A motive. That was such a strong word. It almost sounded like someone did it on purpose. Which could be true, but my chest was pounding from within and the words froze in my throat. I was having a hard time processing the information. 

Suddenly, I remembered the texts. 

I quickly fished inside my pocket for my phone. I opened my gallery to recent screenshots and showed it to the Detective. 

“Jordan Stiler. He's my ex-boyfriend. I haven't spoken to him in like five years, but yesterday I got these texts from him out of nowhere. I didn't think much of it then. But I think you should take a look.” I wiped off my face  slowly as Alice held my hand to offer comfort. 

Detective Daniel Gills examined the texts. There were merely two lines.

‘You are so going to regret how you left me Selena’
‘Hope you like playing with flames. Good luck.’

Finally after a minute of silence the Detective spoke. “Is this Jordan the same man from the picture?” he asked nothing down something in a tiny notebook. 

“Yes” my hands were visibly shaking as I handed him the picture too. 

“Alright, why don't you give me his phone number and address, and I will look into it. In the meantime, do you have a place to go to?”

“Yes. I could go to my fiancè, Kevin’s apartment. It's right across the street. My parents' place isn't far from here either.” 

“Okay that's good.” He dug a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to me. It was a card. “Here, call me if he tries to contact you again. I’ll stay in touch with any updates. Ms Franklin, I will do my best to get you justice.” 

What more could I ask for? But justice always has a strange way of showing up late. 

“Thank you, Detective.” I muttered.  He gave a slight nod and exited the hallway. The other neighbours still lingered like they did not have enough gossip to survive on. I couldn't care less about them. 

I bid goodbye to Alice, pushed the people away, and made my way out the complex. My chest still ached, like something heavy was placed on it, and I couldn't dislocate it for the life of me.  Without anything but my bag on my shoulder, I walked straight into Kevin’s apartment. He had the day off from the clinic, so he was home. As soon as he saw me, and the state I was in, he immediately ran and took a hold on me. I almost collapsed on his hardwood floors. 

“Selena, what happened to you?” He asked after sitting me down on the couch and fetching me a glass of water. 

I took in a deep breath, and looked into his deep blue eyes. 

“My apartment got burned down.” I paused, measuring my words. “Everything is destroyed. They say it was arson"" I slowly sipped on the water, like big gulps would exhaust me further. 

“Oh my god. I did hear the fire trucks pulling up the street. That was for your place? Are you hurt?” He examined my face and hands for any burn marks, with such a delicate touch that I could melt into him.

“I am fine. I wasn't home” I replied, a faint smile on my face to reassure him. “I am going to call Mom.” 

“Okay. I’ll make you some coffee and something to eat. You need the energy”  saying so he left the living room.  

The taste of smoke clung to the back of my throat, even though I hadn’t breathed any in. I glanced up at the expensive chandelier right at the centre of his ceiling. Its frame was crafted from polished brass or gilded bronze, delicately curved and adorned with intricate scrollwork. Every arm branched out like the limbs of a golden tree. 

It was bright and pristine without trying so hard to be. Unlike me.

It reminded me of a similar chandelier I had seen at a party five years ago. At an expensive hotel my parents had booked for us. Attached to a memory I couldn't forget even if I wanted to. 

Champagne and glitter shimmered everywhere. My sister, Tessa, had just been accepted into Yale, following in my footsteps. My parents were, obviously, crazy proud. 

I was in my junior year, holding onto good grades, a modest waitressing job, and a loving boyfriend. 

But by the end of that night, I had lost at least one of those three things. And Tessa, she lost so much more. 

It all happened so fast. Like a hurricane passing through me, uprooting my insides. I don't even remember what thoughts flew through my mind at that precise moment. 

All I remember is not being able to breathe. Not being able to utter a word, when I opened the bathroom door and found Jordan, drunk and clutching onto Tessa’s hand forcibly. Throwing her onto the bare wall, while she begged for him to stop. Her limbs trembling as she tried, with all the strength within her, to push him away. Her pleading eyes filled with terror.

I haven't been able to unsee that terror for the last five years. In fact that terror lived in me now. 

The guilt of not being able to keep my little sister safe from my own boyfriend killed a part of me that day. 

I broke up with him right there in the ladies bathroom, cursing him as loud as I could, before slowly leading Tessa to my car and driving her home. She begged me not to tell Mom and Dad, as her makeup ran all over her face. All I could do was hug her tight and apologize as much as I could. My heart broke into a million pieces seeing her like that. 

Now that I think of it, If I would have dragged his ass to court for attempted assault all those years ago, he probably would be sitting in prison right now, and I would be sipping tea in my own not-so-burnt  apartment. He deserved to rot there. Why did I let him go free? 

Yes, Tessa was the one who begged me to not take any action, because she didn't want anyone to know. And a court case would involve our parents, since she was still a minor then. But why did I listen to her? I will carry that regret with me forever.

That was also the last day I ever spoke to Jordan. 

The incessant humming from my phone brought me back to reality. My head hurt really bad, as if it was being hit by a thunderbolt out of nowhere. I picked up the phone a minute later, only to see one missed call from my mom.

I dialed her back after having some of the pasta that Kevin cooked for me. He stared at me, quiet with concern while I ate. I questioned myself, how did I get so lucky to find someone like him. A doctor, and a great cook. Always knows exactly what I need. I felt like I did not deserve him. Not after what I did. 

Three days passed. My insurance money kicked in. I made every effort to return to normalcy, to convince myself that nothing had happened. But rebuilding your life from the ruins of ash and memory is anything but simple. 

My phone buzzed one fine day, while I was inhaling my morning coffee, like it was a ritual. It wasn't a number I recognized, but I picked it up anyway.

“Is this Selena Franklin I am speaking to?” The voice asked. 
“Yes, this is her”
“Hi, Selena, Detective Gills here. I have a few updates on your case.”
“Oh yes, did you find something?” 
“Yes. It would be better if you could come down to the precinct this evening. I have something to show you.” 
“Alright, I’ll be there.” He hung up the call.

The precinct that evening was pretty crowded. It took me a minute to spot Detective Gills in the middle of the hundreds of people filing complaints. He told me to take a seat next to him, as he turned on his PC to show me a video tape. 

“We examined the security footage from the camera on your street as well as the one at the entrance of the building, though the one at your doorstep was disabled. We found a man, the same build as Jordan, wearing a black hoodie that covered his face, and entering the complex, almost an hour before the arson took place.” 

I almost smiled, as he showed me the grainy footage, and secretly congratulated myself. I knew it was him. He moved with precision, as if calculating his every step. This was the strongest piece of evidence against someone anyone could ever have. 

“We tracked down his address, and when confronted, he denied everything as expected. Although he claimed to know nothing about the fire or the threatening texts, he did admit to knowing you from college. We arrested him this morning, shortly before I called you, based on these tapes. All the evidence points towards him. If all goes well in the trial next week, he could be seeing some serious time. Selena, we caught him. It was Jordan. You don't need to worry anymore.”  

When was I ever worried? 

“We examined the inside of the bag and the photo too.” He handed me back the photo, placed safely in the plastic bag once again. “We double checked the forensics. But there were no fingerprints in there except yours. Our take is, he wiped them off, using ammonia, a bottle of which was found in his apartment.”

Wow. That information sure took me by surprise. 

“He most likely used the photo as a message. Maybe this was a revenge act. Now you don't need to tell me or the judge what happened all those years ago. But if Jordan does, we can't really stop him. Either way you have the stronger case. I really don't see him getting away with this easily.” 

I had been dying to hear those words since forever. 

“Though I must say, I have never seen such a case, where the perp leaves clues for us to find. It seems almost too perfect. Like why would he send you those texts or admit to knowing you if he didn't want to be caught? Either he's really dumb or he wanted to be caught. Ah, who knows? The point is we got him.” The detective had grown suspicious of the obvious clues, but I was just glad that he truly believed it was him. 

I couldn't thank him enough. My face was beaming. With everything out in the open, maybe now I could finally get some closure. Maybe now I could finally move on from this horrific incident. 

I rushed home and gave Kevin the good news. He was as overjoyed as me. We went out for drinks to celebrate. I put on my engagement ring, hidden in the tiny front pocket of my bag, and some new four inch black heels I adored, but they hurt my feet like hell. And I had the best time of my life that night.

The trial proceeded just like Detective Gills had predicted. It lasted for an entirety of two weeks, while my patience ran low. But every piece of evidence was perfectly presented to the judge. Everything pointed to him being the arsonist. 

Three weeks after the fire took place, Jordan Stiler was sentenced to ten years in prison, although I would have preferred at least thirty. Detective Gills himself handcuffed him, after he was proven guilty. 

I stood by the door, not wanting to move an inch forward. Even from the opposite corner of the court room I could hear his screams.

“I didn't do it. I am being framed.” “That woman is a manipulative physco bitch” “I didn't fucking do anything. Let me go!”  and so on. He tried to fight off the police officer, but I guess he wasn't as strong anymore as he used to be. 

Standing perfectly still at my spot, with Kevin’s hand wrapped around me, I smiled meekly. I had been working on this for five years. Of course the plan had to be executed perfectly. I had Alice to thank for that. While I did all the brainstorming, she did all the technical work. Like sending me those texts from a burner phone. Or altering certain security camera footage and wiping off her prints from a plastic bag. 

The best part about setting your own house on fire, is that they never suspect you.

And now Tessa finally gets the justice she deserved five years ago.
As he neared me, my jaw tightened. I could feel a dampening in my chest, and I held on to Kevin’s hand a little tighter, just in case. He screamed at me, the anger projected all over his face. “You stupid bitch, this is all your fault.” He was kicking and punching nothing but the air. Like a little kid throwing a tantrum because his mom wouldn't buy him a new toy. 

I stared into his eyes. Those eyes that I had loved once. They had lost their glow, their charm. They were just pale now. In a quiet, voice, just loud enough for him to hear it, I whispered

“Nobody, I repeat nobody, hurts my little sister and gets away with it.” 

I crumpled up the photo of us which was still clutched tightly between my fingers, and without another glance at it, tossed it into the nearest bin.

And I watched, with a new kind of satisfaction dawning inside me, as the officers forcibly dragged him away. 

~The end~

It hasn't only been said but it also shows, I have 0 or very limited connections from middle and high school, at sport clubs I went to as a kid, from the block I grew up in or from work. Everybody just knows me as this good kid who you don't really hang out with but it's ok to catch up with from time to time. A part of this is because hanging out with people is another full time job and I don't care enough to do it which is fair enough. But most of it I think is because I have a huge ego and don't want to fit in. For starters I don't drink, smoke or do drugs EVER, I don't even drink coffee, teas, coke or anything except water. Never taken a sip of coffee in my life, I'm 19 btw. I don't loosen up at parties, I stay sober and bored except when It's hip-hop or music that I listen to. At conversations I mostly stay silent unless it's a topic I'm passionate about like music, movies or EU politics. If god forbid somehow conversation gets to those topics I'm giving my opinion staight up even if no-one aksed for it and treating it as a word of god. This makes most of conversations with me turn very serious very quickly. My opinions are pretty good I would say and I can argument them correctly but this approach makes people go ""well he is an egoistic dick"" or ""he obviously knows his shit, he doesn't need me"". When in fact I do need people, I'm generally very lonely. I get attached to idols insted of people but when I see my idols bring their friends up on a stage with them it makes me go ""damn, if I ever made it like that I wouldn't have anyone to share it with, I'd have no day ones"". For the longest time I judged my girlfriends music taste for being too shallow which it took me 2 years to stop. She says that my ego gets on her nerves a lot but there are a lot of other good things about me so that's why she stays. I have nobody in my life except her and my best friend and if I were to lose her I would essentially lose more than half my world. I had been to a psychiatrist and she said that I got that from my father, meaning that I view every conversation as a battle, in my head the point is 'win' the conversation. While this sounds smart and is probably true the problem is that it seems very unhelpful. The problem is I don't know what TO DO. I have heard a lot about what not to do in order to come off as less egotistical but my question is what TO DO? What do non egotistical people do? How do they think?

I wanted a divorce.

Everyone around me thought I'd lost my mind.

Nathan Reed came from a good family, had money, and was devoted at home. As a stay-at-home wife, I supposedly had it all—so why throw it away?

They said I'd regret it.

And maybe I was crazy.

Because the moment I saw him carrying a bag for his ex, I snapped.

......

It was an orange Hermès Kelly bag, lychee grain leather.

I'd begged Nathan for that bag for ages, but he never bought it for me.

But this morning, I saw it dangling off the arm of his freshly divorced first love—Vanessa Blake.

There was no way she could afford it herself. It didn’t need spelling out.

That night, I asked him directly.

“Did you give Vanessa that bag?”

Nathan had just gotten home from the research institute, face drawn with fatigue. He didn't even look up.

“Yeah.”

One word. No explanation, no guilt—like buying gifts for another woman was just another Tuesday.

I pushed on. “Are you two seeing each other now?”

That finally got a reaction. He looked up, brows drawn tight.

“Emily Carter, is that all you think about? You see a bag and jump straight to cheating?”

That was Nathan. Always sharp. Never gentle. Always turning the spotlight back on me.

When I asked if he wanted breakfast, he'd snap, “What else?”

When I reached out, trying to be close, he’d brush me off. “Can't you see I'm tired?”

It was exhausting.

Around me, he never bothered to speak kindly.

But with others? He was different.

As a pharmaceutical company CEO and lead research engineer, Nathan knew how to turn on the charm.

With business partners, he was smooth-talking.

With family and kids, he was warm and attentive.

And with Vanessa? Even more so. When he spoke to her, even his eyes smiled.

Thinking about it all, I suddenly felt hollow.

I let out a breath.

“Let's get a divorce. I'm done.”

He glanced at me, said nothing, and walked straight into the bathroom.

......

Not long after, the family group chat on Facebook Messenger exploded. My mom fired off a string of voice messages, each nearly a minute long, every one brimming with outrage.

“Emily Carter, are you out of your damn mind? Walking away from a rich husband and a cushy life? If you dare go through with this divorce, I swear I’ll—”

I tapped on one, listened halfway through, then closed it. I'd heard it all before. I was tired.

I went straight to the county court's website and submitted an appointment request.

I should've done this a long time ago.

What was the point of a husband who always took someone else’s side?

I wiped my eyes and looked toward the bathroom. Water was still running steadily.

There was one more thing I needed to do. Something every person on the brink of divorce ends up doing.

I grabbed the car keys and headed to the underground garage.

After wiping away fresh tears, I yanked open the driver’s door.

Usually, I sat in the back with our daughter, Nova, while she rode in her car seat.

The front passenger seat was always empty.

The “Mrs. Reed Exclusive” sticker I'd once stuck on the center console was now faded and curling at the edges.

That sticker had moved with us—from the old Audi A8L to the Range Rover.

I'd been through the worst with Nathan.

A month after our wedding, his father had been kicked off the board for stock manipulation and banned from the securities market for life. The family teetered on bankruptcy. Their estate nearly got repossessed.

With my encouragement, Nathan broke away and started his own company—dodging the family disaster.

Later, we poured everything we had into helping the family stay afloat.

Honestly? Those broke years were the happiest.

But there was no going back.

I accidentally flipped open the sun visor.

The mirror behind it revealed a surprise that hit me like a slap.

Drawn in bright red lipstick were two hearts pierced by a single arrow.

# Chapter 2

One look—and I knew exactly who had drawn it.

Lancôme #274. Vanessa Blake’s go-to shade.

The bright smear on the mirror burned my eyes. I reached for a tissue to wipe it away—

But Nathan Reed grabbed my wrist.

He’d just come out of the shower, damp bangs clinging to his forehead. Water droplets hit my hand—cold as ice.

His eyes were sharp, almost accusatory.

“What are you doing in my car?”

I pointed at the lipstick on the mirror. “Vanessa’s, right?”

“Yeah,” he replied, tone flat, like it meant nothing.

No explanation. No shame.

“Don’t touch anything in my car. Get out.”

I yanked my wrist free and stayed put, voice calm.

“Your car? Let me correct you—this was bought with our joint funds. I have every right to be here.”

I paused.

“Don’t worry. After the divorce, I wouldn’t touch this car with a ten-foot pole.”

It was tainted.

Nathan let out a cold laugh. “Fine. Divorce it is.”

He opened the back door and pulled out a red velvet box.

I froze. It looked vaguely familiar, but before I could place it, he circled back, standing beside the car, face shadowed, unreadable.

“What, you want a divorce? Let’s go, then. We’ll talk terms inside.”

He tossed the words out lightly and walked off, his back cold and distant.

Watching him leave, my heart felt like it was being crushed under a boulder.

Seven years of marriage, nights spent side by side—and he couldn’t even fake a shred of hesitation.

My patience, my self-restraint—all of it felt like a cruel joke.

I checked the time. Still early. I could handle the other thing later.

I followed him upstairs, trailing a few steps behind.

When we reached the apartment door, someone was already waiting.

And she was holding Nova’s hand.

Vanessa Blake stood there, long black curls cascading over her shoulders, effortlessly elegant.

You’d never guess she’d just walked out of a messy, bloody divorce.

When she saw Nathan, her lips curled into a soft, glowing smile.

“Nova called and said she wasn’t feeling well, so I picked her up from her after-school class. Forgot to let you know,” she said, voice light and sweet.

“Thanks for the trouble,” Nathan replied. Then he looked down at Nova, frowning slightly.

“Next time, don’t bother Aunt Vanessa. If something’s wrong, call your mom.”

Nova pouted, casting me a sideways glance before ducking behind Vanessa.

“I don’t wanna call Mom! She always makes me do stuff I hate. She won’t let me eat sweets, won’t let me have strawberries…”

Her voice was full of childish indignation.

When had she turned into this?

I used to spend nights trying to figure it out, chalking it up to rebellion or defiance.

But now? I didn’t care to analyze it anymore. It just didn’t matter.

I didn’t bother explaining, like I used to—softly, patiently.

“It’s because you had cavities, sweetheart. That’s why no sweets. And you’re allergic to strawberries, remenber?”

I stepped forward to unlock the door.

But Nova suddenly darted out from behind Vanessa, fists raised, and pounded them against my leg.

“Bad Mommy!”

I stood there, frozen, staring down at her tear-streaked face, silently absorbing her anger and her tiny fists.

Until Nathan picked her up and soothed her.

“Don’t be mad, Nova. Daddy will take you to get some candy.”

Once she calmed down, he looked over at me.

He didn’t say a word. He didn’t have to.

Nova wrapped one arm around his neck and grabbed Vanessa’s hand with the other.

“Aunt Vanessa, can you and Daddy take me to the candy store near school? Please?”

My brows twitched slightly.

An invisible hand seemed to clutch my chest—then let go, leaving only empty air.

Before Nathan could meet my eyes, I unlocked the door.

“I’ll draft the agreement,” I said flatly. “You can look it over when you get back.”

I stepped inside. Alone.

I’d planned to ask Nova if she wanted to stay with Daddy or Mommy.

Now I didn’t need to ask.

I already had my answer.

And her?

I didn’t want her either.

# Chapter 3

It was eight o’clock at night when Nathan Reed came home with our daughter, Nova.

Minutes later, I heard the familiar sounds of her flipping through the fridge and turning on the TV. Those bad habits—snacking mindlessly, staring at screens for hours—used to worry me.

I wanted her to grow up healthy and beautiful, so I’d tried to be firm. But all it earned me was a cold “bad mom,” thrown in my face like a dart. These days, I just let it go.

Before long, my bedroom door burst open. Nova marched in, parked herself beside my bed, and started yanking at the blanket.

“Why didn’t you run my bath? I want a milk bubble bath tonight!”

I pressed the blanket down and said flatly, “I’m tired. Go ask your dad.”

She didn’t move. Instead, she grabbed my arm, trying to drag me out of bed. “Dad worked all day! He’s exhausted! You don’t do anything at home. I want you to give me a bath!”

Her words landed like a slap. I almost blurted out, Who taught you to talk like that? But I swallowed it back.

I sat up—and that’s when I saw the divorce papers crumpled in her hand. She’d doodled a cartoon family of three across the page. On one side was Nathan, holding her hand. On the other, a woman with long, dark curls. I didn’t need to ask. It was clearly Vanessa Blake.

Nova tilted her head, giving me a look full of smug defiance, like I was some stray dog soaked in rain. “Dad told me to draw it. He said if you don’t behave, he’ll punish you and make sure you’re not my mom anymore!”

I let out a cold laugh. “Is that so?”

A chill spread through my chest.

Just then, Nathan walked in, toweling off his hair. He completely ignored Nova’s outburst and addressed me in that commanding tone he always used.

“I’m heading out on a business trip in a few days. Pack my suitcase.”

I didn’t move. “I’m serious about the divorce,” I said, steady and calm.

He paused—just for a beat—before narrowing his eyes. The flicker of surprise gave way to annoyance.

“This is about a purse? I’ll send you money. Buy it yourself.”

My phone buzzed. A Venmo notification appeared: $200 from Nathan.

The sting behind my eyes surprised me. I let out a soft, bitter laugh.

Nathan was wealthy—spending tens of thousands without blinking. But now, he tossed me two hundred bucks like I was a panhandler.

I accepted the transfer, my face going cold. “That should cover the divorce filing fee. We’ll divide everything else later.”

He scoffed like I’d just told a joke. “Divorce? You sure about that?”

We locked eyes. The silence between us thickened like fog.

“Mom’s not listening, Dad! Punish her!” Nova cried, clinging to his arm.

Nathan didn’t even flinch. Without a word, he picked her up and walked out.

Moments later, my phone pinged again. A message popped up on FB Messenger. It was a lawyer’s contact card from Nathan, followed by a single line: Talk to my lawyer.

My chest tightened. I stared at the blank message box, fingers frozen above the keyboard. Was there a reset button for life?

After a long pause, I typed: Okay.

I added his lawyer and sent a message stating my intent. By the next morning, the friend request still hadn’t been accepted. Nathan had spent the night in the study.

When I came downstairs, he was shaving in front of the mirror. He was using the imported sensitive-skin shaving cream I’d ordered for him, the one that didn’t trigger his allergies. The bottle was almost empty now.

He saw me in the doorway. His hand stilled for a moment, then he quietly switched his phone to speaker and placed it on the counter.

“Mr. Reed,” the lawyer’s voice came through, “your wife contacted me on Messenger yesterday about a divorce. How would you like to proceed?”

Nathan didn’t look at me. He focused on a patch of missed stubble and replied with careless disdain, “How should you proceed? I hired you to protect my interests. You tell me.”

I said nothing, just watched him.

Back when we were dating, I’d been obsessed with Marriage Story. Scarlett Johansson’s character wrestled with the wreckage of a broken marriage. I remember asking Nathan, “If—and I mean if—we ever got divorced, would we end up fighting over money and assets like that?”

He kissed my hair and said with certainty, “There’s no ‘if.’ I’m growing old with you.”

I could still see the light in his eyes when he said it.

My phone buzzed again. His lawyer had accepted the request.

Mrs. Reed, Mr. Reed has authorized me to represent him in your divorce. What are your terms?

At that moment, Nathan brushed past me with a cold, impassive face.

Nova’s voice floated down the hall. “Dad, I want to stay at Aunt Vanessa’s for a really long time! Don’t pick me up too soon, okay?”

“Okay,” he said.

I didn’t turn around. I waited until the front door closed before replying to the lawyer:

Equal division of marital assets. I don’t want custody of our daughter.

# Chapter 4

The moment I sent the message, a screenshot came back instantly.

It was a chat log between Nathan and his lawyer.

Nathan Reed: Send her this: If she wants a divorce, she leaves with nothing.

I felt the heat rise behind my eyes.

Seven years of marriage, and this was how it would end? I’d thought we could separate with at least a shred of dignity. Clearly, I’d been naive.

I shut off my phone and took a breath. Once the fury had cooled, I turned it back on and started looking for a divorce attorney. After some initial consultations, one of them offered a suggestion.

“Your husband’s a public figure. If you want leverage, gather proof of his affair. That kind of evidence can shift the power dynamic.”

Proof?

I had none. Outwardly, Nathan had never crossed a line.

The silence in the house was suffocating. Nova was at Vanessa’s, and Nathan hadn’t come home. I sat at my computer, blankly refreshing the county court’s appointment page. My heart felt like a stagnant pond.

Leave with nothing? No. I wasn’t going down without a fight.

Just then, a video call from Ashley popped up on Messenger. Her camera was shaking wildly.

“Emily, you need to see what your husband’s doing right now!”

The video stabilized. Nathan and Vanessa were at a dinner table, arm in arm, clinking glasses and laughing, egged on by clients.

Nathan never drank. His stomach couldn’t handle it—he’d ended up in the ER years ago with a bleeding ulcer. After that, he swore off alcohol completely.

He’d told me once, “My health is everything. If I’m gone, how are you supposed to go on?”

But here he was, drinking with Vanessa like nothing mattered.

After the first toast, the clients weren’t done.

“Mr. Reed, there’s still half a bottle left. Don’t let it go to waste!”

Nathan’s expression faltered slightly, but before he could respond, Vanessa grabbed the bottle. “His stomach’s weak. I’ll drink for him!”

She threw her head back and downed the entire half bottle. Coughing, she smiled playfully. “That enough?”

For a moment, the room went quiet. Then came the laughter.

“Mr. Reed, you’re one lucky man! A woman like this—priceless!”

Vanessa’s eyes shimmered as she played humble. “Oh, it’s nothing. Compared to Mrs. Reed, I’m barely doing anything.”

A client perked up. “Oh? Is Mrs. Reed an even heavier drinker?”

Another joined in, “How about this, Mr. Reed—call your wife. If she finishes a glass, I’ll sign that billion-dollar contract tonight!”

Nathan hesitated, then pulled out his phone.

Ashley’s video cut off as my phone rang.

It was Nathan. His voice was low, cold. “I’m giving you an out, Emily. Come to The Ember Room now, and I’ll pretend none of this happened.”

I looked at our wedding photo, crumpled at the bottom of the trash can.

My voice was just as cold. “No.”

He went silent, then snapped, “Fine. Don’t regret this.”

I wouldn’t.

Ashley called again. The video resumed. Nathan slammed his glass on the table. Vanessa grabbed his arm, murmuring sweetly, “Don’t be mad. If she won’t come, I’ll drink for you—”

Ashley muttered under her breath, “Fucking snakes.”

Nathan heard something by the door and looked sharply toward it.

He’d noticed the camera.

His eyes locked onto the lens. Then, he grabbed Vanessa’s wrist as she held her drink.

“You want a show? Record this. Make sure she sees it.”

He downed a shot and kissed Vanessa full on the lips, liquor dripping from their mouths.

A sharp pain stabbed my chest. Then it receded, leaving nothing but numbness.

I stopped the recording and sent the video to Nathan’s lawyer.

“Is this worth half his assets?”

Nathan’s company had just gone public. A scandal like this could destroy it.

A long silence followed.

Then came the reply: Mr. Reed agrees.

A divorce agreement arrived seconds later.

I'd won. I should’ve felt triumphant.

But all I saw in the black phone screen was a pale, exhausted reflection of myself.

On TV, a travel ad flickered on: “Feeling lost? Burnt out? At the edge of the world lies an island that can cleanse your soul.”

Iceland.

My heart stirred.

Since getting married, I’d barely had a moment to myself. Maybe it was time.

I booked a flight and started packing.

Halfway through, I stopped.

There, buried beneath a sweater, was the red velvet box Nathan had pulled from his car the day I first mentioned divorce.

Inside was a man’s wedding band.

# Chapter 5

Nathan Reed never liked wearing jewelry.

When I once begged him to get matching couple’s rings, he turned me down flat.

“I don’t like feeling tied down,” he said, final and firm.

But when he proposed, he chose a wedding band.

Under the golden glow of a Rocky Mountain sunset, we exchanged rings and kissed—like we’d just claimed the whole damn world.

Later, I teased him, “Didn’t you say you hated rings?”

He kissed the one on my finger, his gaze full of love—and something close to reverence.

“The mark proves our love. I’ll never take it off, not in this lifetime.”

Back then, I was the center of his world.

Somewhere along the way, though, Nathan stopped wearing his ring.

Not that it mattered anymore.

Mine had been gone for ages—lost somewhere in the wreckage of us.

......

He didn’t come home that night. Neither did Nova.

The day I booked my flight to Iceland, a package arrived. The sender’s name? Nova.

I hesitated. Then tore it open.

Inside was a Hermès Kelly—vibrant orange, lychee leather. The one I’d always wanted.

Tucked next to it was a note, scrawled in Vanessa Blake’s unmistakable handwriting:

“Heard you were ready to divorce Nathan over this bag. Here it is—so quit throwing tantrums.”

“Oh, and Nathan’s just been with me these past few days, looking after Nova. Maybe try coaxing him a little?”

I tossed the card without blinking.

When you’re truly done, even betrayal loses its sting.

I got rid of everything.

The wedding photos.

The matching down jackets.

The his-and-hers coffee mugs.

Gone. Every last piece.

Right after the cleaning crew hauled off the boxes, the front door creaked open.

Nathan and Vanessa walked in, each holding one of Nova’s hands.

The second she saw me, Nova yanked free, climbed onto the couch, and started barking orders like a little queen.

“Get me ice cream! And Chips Ahoy!”

I ignored her.

I grabbed my suitcase and made for the door—but Nathan stepped in my way, his hand locking down on the handle.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

“On a trip,” I said, cool and flat.

He opened his mouth, but Vanessa jumped in, her voice syrupy-sweet.

“Emily’s probably just tired. A little getaway might clear her head. You two can talk when she gets back.”

She turned to me with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.

“Go enjoy yourself. Don’t worry about Nova—I’ve got her.”

I was about to reply when Nathan’s voice cut through—sharp, demanding.

“Where’s your ring?”

I followed his gaze to my bare finger.

“Lost it,” I said.

His eyes flickered—doubt, maybe—but he masked it quickly.

“Come home soon,” he said.

I gave him a faint smile and didn’t answer.

This wasn’t my home anymore. And I wasn’t coming back.

I closed the door behind me, shutting them all out, then hailed a cab to the airport.

Seven hours later, I landed in Iceland

Quiet. Distant. A beautiful escape from the life I’d known.

The noise, the pain, the wreckage of my marriage—fading with every mile.

One night, I stood with a group of travelers, waiting for the aurora. My phone buzzed. Unknown number.

Nathan.

I thought it might be about the divorce papers, so I stepped away to answer.

Instead, I got this:

“Why aren’t you back yet? When are you going to take me off your block list?”

I frowned, pulling up my calendar.

“Ten days.”

Ten days until the divorce decree was finalized.

As for the block list? He wasn’t getting off it.

“Ten days?” His voice tightened. “Don’t forget who you are. You’re Nova’s mother. You’re my—”

“Emily! The aurora’s out—make a wish!”

A fellow traveler’s shout drowned him out.

I set the phone down, closed my eyes, and made my wish:

May the rest of my days—alone—shine bright and bold.

Ten days later, I was back in the States.

After landing, I hit the salon. When I looked in the mirror, I saw crisp white blouse, glowing skin, and the version of me I hadn’t seen in years—vibrant, fearless, unapologetically alive.

I texted Nathan to meet at a coffee shop near the county courthouse.

He was already there when I arrived.

His eyes lit up when he saw me, but the awe faded fast, replaced by that same smug, controlling tone I’d grown to loathe.

“You can’t keep doing this, Emily—running off like that. The house has been a mess without you.”

As if I was supposed to slink back and play the dutiful wife. As if the screaming matches and shattered trust had all been some temporary drama.

I cut him off. “Let’s go.”

“Go where?” he blinked.

I showed him my Messenger chat with the lawyer, then locked my screen and stood up.

My question is: how does one even focus on one's actions?

Focusing for me is like perhaps focusing on a stimuli, like the smell of coffee, or an object in front of me, or the sound of someone building a house from afar. I can focus on those things because they're stimuli―they have a form. That makes sense to me because it's something I can do.

But detachment feels like this weird strips of clouds over my head I can't hold because it's formless. And because I can't grasp it it makes no sense to me. It's not something I can do akin to moving my fingers to type this post. It feels like it's not within my control. It just feels like it's out of reach.

Which part of our brain does the detaching? Is detachment active or passive? What are concrete ways to actually detach? What are some examples of detachment?

No matter how many times I've listened to Dr.K saying we need to focus on our actions, it never registers in my brain how to do that. 

How does one focus on an action?

I'm not officially diagnosed as autistic but I do highly suspect I am, and I think my difficulty in understanding this concept stems from that, because of how abstract it is.

I've already watched the video about detachment and apathy, ego, karma, and even the concept of time and yet I still haven't figured it out, or at the very least, haven't reached an understanding.

Along with detachment, I also struggle with the concept of letting go and staying in the present moment.

The story with me and my ex gf is interesting. We dated for 6 months before I found out she was sending nudes to another guy. It devastated me to the point where I was shaking and crying when I found out

Her and I weren’t too close when we dated as we were both very shy. After this happened I broke up with her but it wasn’t something I could just walk away from without answers so I stayed by her for 4 days to talk. We talked for hours but took breaks and just hung out. 

I know people will probably say that was a mistake to hang out with your ex after getting cheated on but that’s what we did. We laughed, hung out, and got closer than ever. We were also hooking up which probably complicated things but we were both into it. My best memories from that time with her were chilling in the hot tub, going out to all these places, and staying up late together playing around and watching movies. It was so sweet and we’re both so similar. I didn’t realize how genuinely compatible we were until then and neither did she. I’ve never had a connection like her. I fell in love with her stronger than ever through this. We initially said we would talk about things but never did we just got lost in the moment

My parents at the time were screaming at me and giving me hell for even seeing her to the point where I couldn’t tel what opinions I have on her were my own. What I mean is I couldn’t tell if I left because she cheated or I left because my parents pressured me. I never had the chance to really process or take my time with this. So I left suddenly. I didn’t want to hurt her feelings and I was scared so I gave an excuse and left. It crushed her and she really fought to keep me but I kept pulling away

A year passed and we’ve kept in touch before finally we started hanging out regularly again, only for the same cycle to happen. We get close and then talk about things briefly at the very end without hitting the core issue of her cheating and I left. When I left that time I thought I was telling the truth but I realize I was also making an excuse

2 years later we grab coffee, and talk for a day as usual. We briefly talk about her and me but mostly spend the day just enjoying eachothers company again

Finally, a month later everything blows up. I FaceTime her and express everything to her. How I feel about her, how amazing all those memories are with her, and I miss her but also don’t like what she did. Here’s what’s interesting: I remember when we talked about what she did, I ended up feeling it and visualizing it for the first time and feeling the disrespect and the shame to the point where I was second guessing why I’m even considering her

My parents once again screamed at me and gave me hell and scared me out of doing anything further so the topic dropped for months

Here’s where I’m at now, finally I went down to see her despite what my parents told me and I told her everything. How I realized we never talked about what we said we would and how we got really close unintentionally and I ended up leaving suddenly. I told her rationally looking at it it’s the right choice to have broken up from her cheating on me because what she did was really awful, but at the same time I get frustrated because she became my best friend

So I really don’t know what to do. I really unintentionally fell in love with her despite her doing something so awful to me. It started as a love hate thing but turned into pure love. Sometimes I wonder if I can just look past it because truthfully when I’m with her it’s like that’s the only thing that matters. We’re so alike and can’t imagine not having her with me

I don’t know who to turn to for this, so I figured the only people who would understand what I’m going though is someone who’s experienced the same thing

Please help me

sister in law (39) who I’ll refer to as SL and myself F (31) as well as my SL’s boyfriend (30) who we will call SLB for the sake of privacy. 

My  SL and I have never really been super close. We could never see eye to 
eye well, but we were nice for the sake of the family. One day my SL took me, and a few of our friends out to the bar, during this time someone walked in and you could see on my SL’s face that something was off. It was like she saw a ghost. Grabbing my arm she faced me into the washroom quickly and frantically (she was REALLY drunk by this point) saying that we needed to stay, and that she saw someone she had known. Eventually she spilled the beans. You guessed it she slept with the guy, when her and SLB were together. 

Fast forward to the next morning, my SL wakes up, comes down stairs and acts like her normal self, me being me couldn’t get past it so I asked her about last night. She begged me not to say anything to her SLB because it had only happened a handful of times and that if I said something it would ruin her relationship. 

I agreed, uneasily but agreed none the less, truth be told I was hoping SL would tell SLB herself. She never did. A few weeks go by, and I ran to Tim’s to grab a coffee and as I’m sitting in the drive through I see the same guy, getting out of his car. I thought nothing of it until. I saw her with him… my SL with the same guy she said she had only slept with a few times. 

I had lost it.. I ended up going in her phone when she passed out later that evening and texted SLB from her phone confessing her infidelity on him. As if it was her texting him. 

Things went nuts from there.. am I the asshole for doing that!? She told me I was called me every name in the damn book. Said I ruined everything. Our parents agree with her, said if I didn’t overstep they were sure she would have said something. Truthfully I didn’t think she would because she clearly was still seeing that guy. 

Just to clarify: I had no way of telling him myself without doing it through her phone, I didn’t have his number and he wasn’t around very often just some dinners here and there. And no moment to where I could just pull him aside. Just incase anyone brings that up. 

Genuine advice would be appreciated. Otherwise please do tell me if I am the asshole in this. If I am I will apologize to my SL in the morning. But this is bothering me. And I need your help. I can’t sleep. She hates me. ",3,1754890886.0,AmItheAsshole,17,1.0,False

Looking for a compact grind and brew that serves a pot and single serve,"Our daily driver is a Philips LatteGo 3200, and it's been great for our daily needs, but there are two reasons why I am looking for what I described in the title:

1. When I clean the unit, the process can take some time, especially because I'll often do part of it and then go do something else while I e.g. let the brew group soak to clean off grease. I often can't come back to it immediately, so even if I can theoretically get it back to a working state within the same day, it often doesn't happen. But we still need coffee during this time which we can't get from the Philips machine while we are cleaning it.

2. The Philips unit is great when we have a small number of friends over because they can get something more than just a drip coffee. But when we have a large number of guests over, it takes a while to fulfill everyone's coffee needs one by one.

So what I am looking for is a compact unit I can easily store but take out to do single serve coffee when our other unit is being cleaned, and a pot of coffee when we are trying to serve a large group. The brew and grind is because at this point we only keep whole beans. I could get ground but it just adds more headache to the overall problem.

I got the sense that on the higher end, there may be units that fit most if not all of my criteria, and if I have to spend some money to solve this problem, I may choose to do that, but given that this is intended for rare use, it would be great to get something reasonably priced.

Basically, I’m a 37 yrs old french (Quebec) Canadian, father of two young daughters, living and working in Montreal as a Longshoreman. Worked 10 years in the cinema industry as a Lamp Op before that.

I think I might be approaching mid-life crisis. Not a single day goes on without me thinking I would do anything to leave the city and never come back, but my wife has her whole family and friends here, she’s a very social person, and I’m not.

 Now I realize living here is the ideal scenario for my daughters, as well as for both my wife and I’s jobs, but I hate it. I truely hate it, and every day I swallow it back because I love my family and I want to give them all what they need…. Everyday I wake up in our tiny ass apartment, numb myself in amazon crap and coffee shop cortados, or riding my motorcycle, while I dream about gardening, blacksmithing, chopping wood, clearing a god damn path in some imaginary woodland, digging up streams to funnel them into a DIY hydroelectric dam, anything that would give me purpose in the morning.

Some would say the well-being of family should be, and is, my main purpose, and they would be right… but It cannot only be this. I’ve seen what it does, in a few of the coworkers that I have… they end up as empty shells of themselves. They live to pay the bills..every Thursday morning, the whole pay gets swallowed by bills, while on the shitter, and the whole past week just fades into oblivion.

I’m trying to save up, but the housing/land market seems to be akin the expansion of the universe, as it keeps on growing faster than my  pockets can handle it, and so every day I wonder what the hell am I working for here in the city, and it all feels pointless.

**What can a man do**, to promote actual change towards a simpler (*I won’t say easier*) life?

What the hell can I start doing, be it in my habits, my hobbies, that could kindle a step into the right direction, away from the end of me?

**Because man, I seriously wonder wtf am I doing with my life…**

Also, if someone here has had a similar experience, your guidance would be truely appreciated!

My dad recently went through a pretty bad medical emergency and fortunately he came out of it, mostly fine. He’s got all his motor skills functioning perfectly. He has been very manipulative ever since. Hussing and fussing. He stopped treating me like a son and more of a butler. 

I have no issue helping out, I really don’t.. but when he wants something, he expects it to happen right then. I’ll ask if he needs anything before I go to my room and he will say no. 2 minutes later he tells for me to make him a cup of coffee. 

He will get up and acts like he’s having the best day, only to lay down and again call for me to grab a blanket that’s at his feet and cover him up. Keep in mind this is maybe 5 minutes after he was up and walking around.

I finally told him that he can do things on his own and he responded with “you don’t know what it’s like to suffer like I have” as if I didn’t go through absolute hell as a kid. In and out of the hospital.. surgery after surgery. In pain still as I type this. 

I snapped at him and now he isn’t really talking to me. I feel so bad because I’m trying my absolute hardest to help. I don’t know exactly what he has gone through but for him to say that really hurt. ",3,1754890491.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False
1mn4pgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1mn4pgq/forgiveness/,Forgiveness,"I tried to explain to my 22 yo m ex A.V. that his anger and hatred towards me had no real reasonable basis to be had against me seeing as how I had done nothing to ever cause him to choose to do the vicious heartless things he did that hurt me so intensely. I had done nothing but loved unconditionally and even forgiven him for his infidelity and recklessness that gave me gonorrhea and shigella that became septic and put me in the ICU fighting for my life in total embarrassment for 6 days. I took his half assed apology and his forced cry on command technique as him truthfully being sorry and learning a lesson as valid. 
   He had asked me to be his monogamous lover 46 yo m N.S. while we were seeing each other in the same city of Tulsa when he’s out of school from Manhattan Musical School so he doesn’t get jealous or an STI. Yet, he went behind my back while saying he was depressed because his dad who lives in Italy and is an absent father who doesn’t support or see the family much anyway is separating from his mom for good. But that’s enough upsetting news that he’s so down he wants to be sad alone for about a month from the end of May ‘24 to the middle of June ‘24. This is right after we have the best time together being back together for the summer and had a great time with me taking him to float the river together for the first time. We even pulled over and made love and we both had a terrific time. 
    So after about a month of neglect he all of a sudden wants to have sex and then says he fell out of the mood but wants to the next night and to break out the swing. I’m let down but excited. So the next night it’s set up and we start and as I go down he’s not clean and I quickly pull away and wash my mouth and listerine and ask him who he didn’t douche. He proclaims in his Italian accent they it makes him feel weird. So I ask why doesn’t it make him feel weird to let someone go down when you’re not certain you’re fresh and clean and why not even cleaned it with finger and soap. So he goes and washes and comes back and gets in the swing.
   As I penetrate and start going a bit by bit, being gentle and considerate, he startles me and quickly gets out of the swing as if there’s a wasp on him. I ask wtf? He says he can’t do it because it reminds him of a bad experience he’s once had. I’m stunned. I’m like, you’re a 22 yo that I thought was prude and inexperienced and I thought this was your first time. He says no and he doesn’t even want to tell me about it or try to make a good new experience. So disappointedly we have it regularly boring traditional style and it’s just off and bad. We can’t kiss bc his throat hurts bc he had what he thought was strep and had it treated in the end of May but it flared back up and was worse with pustules and hurt. 
    So the night was disappointing. The sex was off. He came quickly and was satisfied and I was not because I didn’t and there was just no love or connection. It felt like he was doing it out of pity or duty. Plus I was really put off by the realization that he wasn’t telling me anything about his past experiences and it wasn’t from a lack of them as I had always assumed. 
   A couple days later he said he was going to get his throat checked out and he was disappointed in his Dr care because they didn’t fix it or know what it was and despite the antibiotic it was still bad. He said he was going to get checked for STI’s too. I was like, wait a tick, we were both tested before you came home and were fine. Why would you need to do that? To which he admitted to being with someone at the end of May. 
     I held my temper and tone and expressed how upsetting and unexpected this was to hear about. He started saying things like he wasn’t attracted to me for really stupid small things like I put on weight since we first met (5 lbs), didn’t quit vaping like I said I would, was eating out instead of cooking at home too often, wasn’t showing any effort in being active, and stupid stuff like that. He said this guy was cute and he met him on Grindr ( a month earlier he had sworn he learned his lesson to stay off these apps because he had met a felon and done meth and GHB with him on a Tuesday in April, the next Friday, and again the next Friday and then texted me on Sat and called me freaking out that he had done that, hadn’t slept in 36 hours, the messed around but couldn’t get hard or off, his roommate would find out, and other issues but I calmed him down and kept him from going to the ER or freaking out. He swore off the sites and was going to cancel the hookups he had set up with two other dudes he matched with on Hinge and was going to appreciate what he had and took for granted right before him, a loyal dedicated faithful good man ME.) 
    So, here he has broken an oath and obviously learned nothing by hooking up behind my back with someone and thinking I’d never find out. On the 5th day after we had sex I noticed pus in the tip of my dick. I thought that it could be an infection from his throat infection and told him about it and went and got checked. They had rapid results and confirmed it was gonorrhea and that it had to come from him because the last guy was with was three months before him and we were faithful to each other. So I told him it was him and he told me that he was with the dude again in June and it turned out that it would have had to have been two days before we were intimate. Which made our sex encounter guilt/pity sex. I was really upset. Then I pushed him and asked him who to see if I just happened to know who it was and I wanted to see if it was some young hot stud or someone better than me so it would make sense as to why he would do this to the guy that has been nothing but thoughtful, respectful, dignified, loyal, supportive, his best friend, not possessive, everything he wanted and needs. Then he tells me and I lose it! Yeah. I knew the guy. I met him a few weeks prior at a friend’s house when he was over there hooking up with his roommate.
    So this 6’5” 38 yo m comes out of his roommate’s room and comes into the living room where the home owner and our buddy are chilling, talking, having a couple of drinks, smoking a bowl, and listening to music. He comes into the room totally naked without a care. He has a really tall skinny body but he once had some weight because his chest was saggy, his belly was sagging, and his butt cheeks were too and they were wrinkly like a 90 yo out of shape old man’s are. He had a really big uncut deformed pecker that he later stated you can’t do much with it because it’s too sensitive. He had track marks and splotchy greasy skin, balding thinning hair, missing his front teeth from canine to canine, a wrinkled weather worn face, and had a glass pipe of meth in one hand, a torch in the other, and a syringe of dope tucked behind his ear like a cigarette and comes and sits beside me on the couch. He starts talking to my friends and being rude and making rude comments and bad teasing remarks as he starts smoking meth in front of everyone like it’s no big deal. I sat quietly and observed and everyone just acted like that’s normal with him as he kept smoking and searched for a
 vein to shoot up so he could go back and finish doing my friend’s roommate. I was appalled and saw no redeeming quality in the man. 
    So I find out from A that this is who he let breed him? He didn’t think he was disgusting enough from sheer first sight to say, oh hell no? Then I get the details of the situation. A got complimented by this dude on Grindr (that he shouldn’t have had) and falls for his younger catfish pics that are admittedly nice. But then he goes from his nice neighborhood all the way across town to the NE side where it is very poor and run down, trashy dilapidated track homes built quickly and cheaply many years ago and not expensive and not kept up. It looks rough and he still went. He pulls up to a really run down duplex with broke down trashy cars and junk in the yards and broken basket ball hoops and shit and walks up to the garage door and still doesn’t leave. The garage door of the duplex opens up enough that he can duck under and come into a garage he converted into what he calls an apartment. It has no running water and no bathroom and A had to pee in an empty water bottle. Still doesn’t leave. He see this dude with no teeth and all these gross things, the dude has to smoke meth and shoot up in order to be erotic with my gorgeous perfect angel and he still doesn’t leave. He gets naked to and lets him kiss him, touch him, suck each other, rub on each other, and he lets him penetrate and breed him. He said when I asked if he enjoyed it that he did because he had no teeth. I wretched. It’s bad that he did it at all but it’s unbelievable that he went back for a second time! I asked him why? He said something like he wanted to hit rock bottom and let rock bottom hit him. He was disappointed though because he went to a junkie to have kinky sex but he couldn’t do it. I asked what kind of kink. He says the kind you might possibly not come back from. The fear of death. I was in so much shock and disgust I couldn’t even discuss it anymore. I just kept yelling in a questioning tone, over and over again, the guy’s name, “D!?” 
   I cried and I don’t cry over stuff like this. I fell apart. We had a lot to discuss and he begged me not to leave him and to be his friend but insisted that he was just not attracted to me and that he just got horny for some new d. But he’s attracted to this nasty ass dud?!! wtf? I’m a billion times hotter and classier than this dude. Like a younger, thin or fit, or hot older daddy with money, or something I don’t have, I could comprehend and accept and just move on. But this is bull. This is (and later I find out that it is all untrue the way he felt about me he just needs a reason to not look absolutely terrible and sick like he is) all so unbelievably awful. The next morning I can’t get out of bed and consider giving up or going to an institution because it made me feel so bad about myself and they the love of my life betrayed me so awfully for such a trashy substitute who actually is infected with HIV and doesn’t treat it and doesn’t inform people and actually denies it so he can spread it out of malice and hate because he’s been infected. Thankfully we are both on Prep. 
     So for the next few weeks we  still hang out and talk and I try to adjust from being madly in love to being recklessly endangered, assaulted, battered, infected, betrayed, deceived, insulted, belittled, chastised, and brokenhearted and yet still be friends as he continues to defend himself and tells me I’m not good enough and he’s not attracted. Then one morning I wake up and I’m freezing cold and nauseous. I have a ketamine appointment for therapy. My mom comes and picks me up because I cannot drive there or after. 
    I get to my appointment and immediately have to run to the bathroom to vomit and diarrhea at the exact same time. I sit on the toilet and vomit to the side on the floor but it’s just water I had drank earlier. I get up and compose myself and wash my face with cold water. I check in and sit in my recliner and the assess my bp, temp, bpm vitals and say that they’re calling the paramedics because my rates are so high I’m on the verge of having a stroke or heart attack. July 11 2024 btw. The medics come take me to the ambulance and give me a bath bag, blanket, shot to stop the vomiting, start the IV, and decide to use a drug to stop my heart twice to slow it down. They administer it and it doesn’t even remotely phase me. So they take me to the ER. 
    The ER takes my stats and find they are not better and that my temp is actually so high it’s cold on my forehead but my armpit and body read so high my brain is about to fry and that’s why I’m freezing in July. The drugs they administer aren’t effective so the send me to the ICU. The ICU send me to the Heart ICU. They take X-rays and blood and do tests as they strip me of everything from clothes to jewelry. They search my bag for anything they might find as a cause of contamination or concern and find nothing. They start cutting me and putting in thick cords and sewing them in, jam a terribly painful catheter into my Johnson, and pump me full of fluids, steroids, antibiotics, and I am profusely and uncontrollably liquid shitting almost every hour, for an entire day and a half. It is non stop working on me with no breaks and one shift change and going on day two and a half before things start to calm down and my body isn’t releasing acidic bile out of my bum. I’ve got tubes in my wrists, my armpits, my legs, my neck, my chest and they’ve done several procedures to get special machines hooked up and finally on the fourth day I’m stable. 
   On the fifth day I’ve gotten well enough they take me out of the ICU critical care surgery room and into a recovery room. I’ve gained over 35 lbs of liquid weight from the fluids they’ve pumped into me. I’m able to not poo as much but it is still painful acidic burning liquid. I’m still hooked up to every cord in every part of my body and have to lay in bed and rest. The Dr comes in and says the cause was determined to be a virus spread through poop and it became septic and just about killed me had I not come in that day. From her expert determination of my lifestyle and the deduction of everything it had to have been spread via oral sex. I knew immediately that it was from that day with A on the swing and he had been the carrier either from that nasty hookup with the disease monger or being a slut in NYC. When I told A about it he was probably the most emotional I’ve ever seen him and it was still not very genuine. But he said some really good lines and texted me some really good ones too. He said he didn’t realize how much he loved me until he almost lost me and they he was so sorry. That he would never lie to me again and that if his feelings ever changed or if he planned on meeting with someone he’d tell me beforehand. He said he wanted to be monogamous with me and be with me forever the rest of the summer. I forgave him again and we were great lovers for the last few weeks we had. We had sex despite my healing making it kinda tough just about every day. He was insatiable as he was when we first got together. 
    Things were great until the day he told me he was leaving early to go to school in NYC for his last year. We might not see each other for 5 moths. I had a dentist appointment the last day I got to see him and I had my mouth numbed. So I didn’t get a good last time, goodbye kiss or make out session. He was kinda manic and when I went to his house he was distant and not at all lovey-dovey. He didn’t care that we couldn’t kiss and he didn’t hardly even hug me. He basically said he didn’t want to get all emotional but he loved me and that we were still very much in love and we’d talk all the time and see each other in 5 months. But I knew deep down it was the last time I’d ever have him in my presence ever again. I just knew that things with us would change. I had noticed things about him that made me realize that he is sick and untrustworthy. 
    Five days after he was in NYC he said to go find someone and F them. We aren’t boy friends. We aren’t monogamous. We’re lovers. It’s no big deal. He didn’t have anyone he wanted to see or anything. He just didn’t want to have to be tied down. Then I met someone and he changed his tune. He became possessive. Then about a month later he went and saw this old man 56 yo director A.S. that he has been seeing since he first started school at age 18 and he was using as a connection even though he wasn’t attracted to him. He could get free show tickets, free fancy meals, and a potential role some time. He swears they didn’t sleep together and then changed his story and said they never have done more than kiss and mess around. But evidence proves this t be untrue. Like the unmoving GPS locater for a substantial amount of time meaning it’s not on your body because you’re naked. 
    We fight because he doesn’t let me break up with him and he won’t pay me attention or sext with me anymore when it’s always been every day. But a month later on Oct 11th ‘24 he sends me the first sexy nude pic out of nowhere of him in the shower with no pubes. He only shaves before sex. He says he’s going to have coffee at his friend’s work where they’re gong to recite lines and practice. But I don’t see how that’s possible if he’s working. But ok. So I want to see where this shop is to look it up. I’ve been to NYC and I like checking out the places goes to. Turns out to be an apartment a block up from his school and a few blocks south of his apartment. I check to see what else is there and it’s a cleaners and the rest is residential. So I figure he’s picking him up they’ll go. But I check again 15 min later and he’s still there and his GPS is totally still, same position. I’m pretty sure I know what’s going on. So I text something saying, is your friend cute? If I were in a place like NYC I’d be looking on my Grindr (which he has sworn off again bc of what happened to me and because he’s not even interested in sex since he saw the old man) to see all the hotties. It’d be a smorgasbord of guys to choose from. No word. No movement for like an hour and 45 min. Then a text and movement as he’s leaving the building saying, “coffee was good” as if to say sex was good, in my eyes. I’m pissed. He broke all his promises to me in one fail swoop and I know it for sure but can’t accuse or start another fight without proof. He continues to say, why’d you say that and no his friend isn’t cute. I tell him because I don’t want him to hold back on experiencing relationships or a possible love because of some dedication to me when we have no real future forever together. He says that I don’t have that kind of power over him. Yet he said I was the alpha and in charge of our relationship the month before? Then he says he doesn’t want sex, he doesn’t even think about it, he’s kind of disgusted by it, that he prude when in work mode, he’s going to one of the top ten music schools in the world so he has more to focus on like rehearsals and shows. Then chastises me for wanting to sext and asking to see him naked and feeling rejected that he didn’t respond to my vid or even acknowledging it. The entire time he’s walking home with fresh sex sweat all over his body and a fresh load up his guts. I was so pissed but I couldn’t say anything.
    The next five days I am sitting on it but he’s better. He’s more attentive and nice like he used to be. So I figure he just needed to get banged and I’ll let it go. I’ll see him in a month and things will be cool. So I go down to my car to get dinner and I look up and see the great big full moon. That’s our love connection symbol. We both love the moon and have love sayings to each other with the moon she we can both see it no matter that we’re apart. I text him to look up at knowing he’s walking to rehearsals. He responds, “yeah. I’m going to hookup with someone tonight just fyi” as if he’s not just dropping a bombshell on me in passing before he cannot be reached for three hours and dismissing my love entirely. I start trying to not make a big deal about it buy this isn’t what we agreed upon or how to do it. I was furious. He’s able to respond they once again he had found someone on Grindr he’s 25 doesn’t do drugs it’s no big deal. I see him walking to the same apartment that he got banged in five days before and he isn’t really talking to me about it. He shows up there and cuts all communication and his dot goes still just like last time in the same exact spot. I start to lose it. Then it goes into three hours and I’m starting to realize the only reason he told me the truth is because there was no believable lie to explain why he was there on a school night when he cannot even find time to chat with me. Then I realize it’s not a hookup, it’s a sleep over. He doesn’t even hardly get to stay with me overnight in Tulsa. Yet he’s there 13 hours. I can’t sleep and I go into BPD blackout psycho hate text. 
   This was the end of us. He lied about his location two days in a row after this incident and his GPS bounced when he said he was at a show proving he had a VPN and altered the times of the pictures he tried to use as evidence. He turned it on me saying I’m possessive and controlling when I told him I don’t care. Just don’t lie. All you have to do is tell me the truth and give me a little warning and back story. 
    He then twisted on me to make me the bad guy. I got so pissed and asked myself why does he do this to me and why does he do the other reckless stuff that I’ve not even mentioned. It’s because he’s really mentally ill. So I thought of who I could tell to get him help because he’s not listening to me and quit seeking help and taking his meds when he went up there. He talked about selfharm and about how he smokes weed and drinks all the time and puts himself in dangerous places and situations. I couldn’t tell his mom because she weak and fragile and wouldn’t admit it or listen. So I wrote a long letter to his school thinking they’d intervene. But it backfired. I also talked to a counselor who advised me to tell the cops about what he did to me in May so I did. They opened an investigation on him and the other guy. I had it dropped because I didn’t want to ruin his life. But when he found out he got a lawyer from his rich aunt and filed an emergency protective order against me. The reason they used happened in Oct when he cheated on me and lied and I went crazy upset and they lied and manipulated stuff and it was two months later. 
   I was served at 5 pm on a Friday and had court on Monday at 8am. I had no time to get council. I had no car so I showed up via internet. His attorney and him showed up at the court. We were first up. I couldn’t hear anything that she said. But the judge basically asked if it was alright that they have a 6 month continuation for a second hearing when he was out of school. I didn’t have a choice it seemed to me I said and he said true. I asked him for her evidence and he said to take it up with her. So the next day I called her and tried to converse and get the evidence against me. She denied me and cut me off rudely. I tried to communicate with her in total honesty and fairness to make this case go away or come to a fair settlement. She insisted on a 5 year VPO even though I’m the victim and he’s a liar trying to shut me up about exposing his true identity because he thinks he’s going to be as famous as Celine Dion (no joke, his words) and wants revenge to discredit me. So I stress out for 6 months, lose my hair, get sick repeatedly, cannot get an attorney because it’s civil and not criminal, and my closest most loved Grandma dies in the end of May after I have a breakdown depression 46th birthday May 7th hell where I tried to end it all by taking a chunk of fentanyl. But I wake up and have a change of mindset the next day. Then she dies. Then my hearing comes up June 5th and they make me have a trial with no defense. So a psycho bitch lawyer all prepared with false and manipulated texts and anything she can put together against an unprepared inexperienced me get ambushed in trial and railroaded by false info that leaves out his wrong doings and the things that prove they’re twisted and I never say that they’re my words because I’d have to compare them to my own yet the judge let’s her use them as factual evidence even though they’ve not been proven. 
    This cow has me so twisted and my mind so broken that I couldn’t put together in my head all I needed to defend myself. I managed to prove some of it was twisted and that was done with him. That I had no desires to be with him or communicate at all. The judge granted them the stupid 5 years and in my favor neglected to give him the life time that he usually gives. So I was mildly okay with it. But they straight up lied and he acted like a little bitch victim as if he was scared of me. I’m disabled with osteoporosis and no weapons. The only weapon I have is my words, the truth, his texts to prove them true, and my ability to write. 
    So the stage is set. It’s over yet he still harasses me. Telling me to die slowly. That I should commit suicide and that no one will care if I die. That I’ll never achieve anything. (I already have mind you.) He thinks he has a right to hate me and make me a bad guy when all I ever did was look out for him when he didn’t. Try and get him to stop doing nasty bad things that jeopardize his future and reputation. He’s not thinking about it coming to destroy his future if he were to make it somehow. But I reality he’s not talented enough to make it on a show boat as a back up dancer. He had no emotions so he can’t act. His voices isn’t that great. He goes flat. Or sounds Ike he’s yelling. He can’t drop his Italian accent. He has a smacking dry mouth problem. He pronounces words weird. He’s obviously gay. He’s very tall and skinny. He’s very beautiful but he’s weird, has a flat back of his head, very thin lips, and very square jaw. He’s rather high pitched a lot of times. He’s delusional. He’s antisocial personality disorder and BPD. By his own admission he lies about everything, all the time, to everyone, for no reason, he doesn’t know why, and can’t stop. 
     I’ve tried to get him to drop this stupid VPO against me. I’ve tried to ask for forgiveness. I’ve explained that I love him unconditionally. It wouldn’t have been true love if I didn’t truly love him. But that doesn’t mean I want to be with him or ever see him again. I don’t have to hate him. I don’t hate him. Although I probably should. I just want him to go away and not live in Oklahoma. I want him to go get the help he needs. But he has no right to be angry with me. He did this. He did all of this to the greatest guy he’s ever known. The only person who made love to him and not used him. Let him dictate the rules and when we were together. Gage him a special birthday by gifting him a box full of thoughtful useful and handmade personal gifts because he was alone and no one showed him love like that. Took him to authentic Italian pizza dates because of our shared history of both living in Italy at the same ages. Took him to expensive authentic Italian dinner and then to see The Nutcracker. Found out months in advance what he could want that he’d never get and gave it to him for Christmas (a telescope) and had a social Christmas Day with him with a giant stalking with an A on it and filled with something to cover what I wanted to kiss on him. So from head to toe: a stalking cap, chap stick, scarf, gloves, tshirt, undies, socks, Italian candies and chocolates, and a candle and some other cute stuff. A journal yearly planner that was expensive and very nice. I bought him a SIMS tank top bc he’s obsessed with the game. A silver necklace, bracelet, and anklet, to match mine and be bonded by jewelry and make him look more classy and sophisticated. I smothered him in love yet gave him freedom, space, and never passed judgement on his bad choices or slitting around or having gonorrhea of the throat three previous times to giving it to me without consent or knowledge of him cheating. 
    Why? Why does he get to be mad at me? Why isn’t he hating himself and embarrassed and apologizing to me? Why does he get a VPO instead of me against him? Why does he get to continue to go off and be cute, young, handsome, and continue to do his grotesque self abuse?",1,1754890405.0,gayrelationships,0,1.0,False

I think I’ll be okay when you go. I will get through it. I did it before, right?
The day after our last board exam… Hindi, was it? I don’t even remember the subject, but I remember seeing the day set right in front of me. Did we sit there after exams? Both of us didn’t want to leave, both of us were scared if it was the end. The end of school, the end of us?

It was an ice cream parlour we entered at noon after our exams and left right before the sunset. Two innocent souls who didn’t even know why they were feeling the way they did, who didn’t want the time to pass, the day to end, because there was no “I’ll see you tomorrow at school.” But we said our goodbyes, went home that day, and cried our hearts out because neither of us wanted to be each other’s history. With all that we had in us, with the shine in your eyes, you said goodbye. We didn’t know how we would stay away.
But we did. We did say goodbye that day.

And remember that day? You finished your exams and had to move abroad for a job opportunity. We bawled at the uncertainty. We felt hysterical about the future and the unknown. We felt everything, the feeling of leaving everything you built together behind, the feeling of not having anyone to rely on around us, and most of all, the feeling of seeing you smile and falling for it again and again like an idiot. We felt it all that day again. We didn’t want to leave each other behind, so we decided we would carry a part of each other wherever we go, and we held onto it. We spent our days in silence and heavy hearts, and we said our goodbyes. Again. The show must go on, right?

Days, weeks, months, and years passed. You heal, but the pain of distance? Every day it feels as new as the sun shining after the darkest night. Then you came. You came. I was just starting to be okay with the distance, but you came. I could breathe again. I didn’t realise I had been breathing half-heartedly all this while. My heart smiled, I thought only my face could do that. You came. The sun rays felt cooler somehow, the days were exciting, and life was absolutely worth living. My city, our city, looked interesting, like it was built just for us. I sneaked out as much as I could, and we had endless coffee dates and drives. But alas, the wretched goodbye hovered over us like a grim reaper dropping by to say hi. You told me we did it before, we could do it again. I told you I didn’t want to live half-heartedly like this. You told me that the next time you came, we would upgrade our titles to fiancés. But for that to happen, I had to let you go. The goodbye this time was sour, like sour candy given to you the moment you wake up. It devastated me, but I cried to you only once when you left. You had promises to keep, so I let you go, and my life turned black and white again.

How did another year pass? I was just starting to like black and white, and now you are telling me it is going to be colourful again for a while. You coloured my fingers with the brightest red of love, just as you dearly promised. Thank you for bringing those colours into my life. Your love feels like a privilege I don’t deserve. You gave me a reason to live on. You handed over the colours and told me, “Wait, I will be back with more. Until then, don’t remain colourless.” Being engaged to you was a dream I didn’t even know I had. How does such an amazing human want me and only me? But you did, and we got each other.

But then the grim reaper dropped by again to say hi and tell us it is time for goodbyes. You are leaving. But this is the last goodbye, right? My soul has longed for so long, it doesn’t deserve one more farewell. When will I see you again? Will we not see any other sunsets of 2025 together? Maybe to see every sunset of some other year side by side, we have to put 2025 at stake. But how can we be certain tomorrow's sunrise will find us in the same world, when we are oceans apart?",2,1754890193.0,TwoXIndia,1,1.0,False

1mn4lq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mn4lq7/aitah_i_got_offended_of_his_reaction_regarding_my/,AITAH i got offended of his reaction regarding my sexual history?," I just didn't tell him I never had sex until him. I am 29 (F) so I know most men would believe I have some deep issues. I don't think I have, but I never felt I like someone enough to sleep with them. Just physically. This was in the beginning. After the age of 24 I started to believe its weird, not appealing anymore and I was ashamed. All my female friends told me a guy will know because I will bleed. Guess what? They were wrong and I didn't. He didn't even know I never did it before.

He is an airline pilot, 32, charming and handsome and I hookuped up with him on the very first day. He was the pilot of my own flight lol and we exchanged a few words when he went to the toilet during the flight. After, we saw each other in the airport coffee shop. One thing led to another and we ended up at his place. We both live in this city, he was not on a layover.

And it was great. I wasn't even nervous. At first a little bit but honestly, I watched a lot of adult films in the past years so I faked experience and maybe overdone it a bit. I even gave him a B J and forced myself to g--ag lol. Because I read a guy likes that. And many other things that a beginner probably doesn't do. But I am 29 and not 16 so maybe the age is a factor.

I told him the next day and he said he wished he knew. Why? SO you can push me away? He said he wouldn't have pushed me away, he would just take him time with me. But I didn't need it. I am not fragile. It was just sex. He was rougher but I didn't mind, because he went slow in the beginning. So anyway, he looked offended a bit and I did feel offended too and looked down upon. I don't feel I owe anyone this explanation. It will not affect them in any way. 

I left and two days later he texted me that he is very sorry and wants to meet. Should I? I am pretty upset because of his reaction. I told him to go find himself someone with more experience and he said he wants to get to know me.

Everybody knows inflation is crazy high all over. My boyfriend and I are both born and raised in Norway and and 15-20 years ago we could travel anywhere and feel the like the world is a cheap place because the Norwegian currenncy back then was so strong but that have definitely changed. I said to him yesterday something like «yes the Norwegian currency is superweak but it’s crazy almost everywhere, it’s not easy to get by in Europe or the US either». He said the salaries in America is much higher, like a shift leader working at McDonalds earns around 110.000 USD a year. I told him maybe that’s true but that doesn’t tell us everything because you have to compare that salary to costs of living. And he says a coffee in the US costs around 4 dollar. I said I assume that really depends on where you buy your coffee but the main point here is that he claims people in the US aren’t struggling as much as Europeeans (and Norwegians) because they still «rule» the worlds economy and the salaries have gone up and it’s so much easer to make a comfortable life for yourself the US compared to here. Me on the other hand is under the impression that people in the US now days struggle just as much as the rest of us «covid-survivors».

**Weight Capacity:** Weight capacity is a critical factor, notably for larger tables. reputable manufacturers clearly state the weight capacity of their legs, typically ranging from several hundred to over a thousand pounds per set. The stated weight capacity refers to the distributed load, meaning the weight should be evenly spread across the tabletop. For example, a set of legs rated for 500 pounds can comfortably handle a 4-foot-long solid wood tabletop, but it cannot support a concentrated load of 500 pounds in the center.**Mounting Plate Design:** The mounting plate is the interface between the table legs and the tabletop. Quality legs feature a well-designed mounting plate, typically made from thick steel with pre-drilled holes for easy attachment. The size and shape of the mounting plate can vary,with some opting for a square or rectangular design,while others prefer a more streamlined,minimalist approach.The number of pre-drilled holes is vital for ensuring a secure and stable connection, and the inclusion of screws specifically sized for the legs is a beneficial bonus.**Adjustable Feet:** Manny 40-inch metal table legs include adjustable feet.

A few months ago, I decided to take a slower, more mindful approach using simple Ayurvedic and meditation practices, and to my surprise, they worked better than any quick fix I’d tried before.

Here’s what made the biggest difference for me:

1. **Warm herbal tea before bed** I swapped late-night coffee for a cup of caffeine-free herbal tea with cardamom, ginger, & tulsi. Ayurveda suggests warm, calming drinks to relax the nervous system, and I actually noticed my mind winding down faster.
2. **Oil massage for the feet:** This one sounded odd at first, but massaging warm sesame, mustard, or coconut oil into my feet before bed was incredibly grounding. It’s a small sensory cue that tells my body, “It’s time to rest.”
3. **10-minute guided meditation:** Instead of endless scrolling, I listen to a short, guided body-scan meditation in bed. I usually don’t make it to the end before I drift off.
4. **No heavy meals after sunset:** In Ayurveda, digestion slows at night, so lighter dinners helped me avoid that uncomfortable “too full” feeling that can keep you awake.
5. **Consistent bedtime ritual:** More than any one habit, having a repeatable “wind-down” routine trained my brain to recognize it’s time to sleep.

Now, I’m falling asleep faster and waking up without feeling groggy—and honestly, it’s been a game changer for my mood and energy.

One such cutting-edge approach is [Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)](https://geo-toronto.com/), a transformative method that leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative technologies to optimize content for modern search engines. This article explores the concept of GEO, its significance for businesses in Toronto, and how GEO services are reshaping the digital marketing ecosystem in this vibrant city.

# What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?

Generative Engine Optimization ([GEO](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesagencycouncil/2025/01/02/generative-engine-optimization-geo-the-future-of-search-is-here/)) is an advanced digital marketing strategy that optimizes content to align with the capabilities of AI-powered search engines and generative AI models, such as those used in modern search platforms and conversational AI tools. Unlike traditional Search Engine Optimization (SEO), which primarily focuses on keyword placement, backlinks, and technical website optimization for conventional search engines like Google, GEO is tailored to the nuanced ways AI-driven platforms interpret, generate, and rank content.

GEO involves creating and structuring content to appeal to AI models that generate answers or recommendations by synthesizing information from multiple sources. These platforms, such as AI chatbots, virtual assistants, and next-generation search engines, prioritize content that is contextually rich, authoritative, and user-focused. GEO services aim to ensure that a business’s content is not only discoverable but also prominently featured in the responses generated by these AI systems.

# Why GEO Matters for Toronto Businesses

Toronto, as Canada’s largest city and a global hub for technology, finance, and innovation, is a competitive market for businesses vying for online visibility. With over 3.6 million residents and a diverse economy, the city is home to thousands of businesses, from startups to established enterprises, all seeking to capture the attention of local and international audiences. As AI-driven search technologies gain prominence, GEO has emerged as a critical tool for businesses to stand out in this crowded digital landscape.

# 1. Rise of AI-Powered Search and Conversational Platforms

The shift from traditional keyword-based search to AI-driven conversational search is transforming how users find information. Platforms like Grok, created by xAI, and other generative AI tools are increasingly used to provide direct, synthesized answers to user queries. For example, a Toronto-based restaurant might not only want to rank high on Google but also ensure its menu, reviews, and location details are accurately surfaced when a user asks an AI assistant, “Where’s the best Italian restaurant in Toronto?” GEO services optimize content to meet these demands, ensuring businesses remain visible in AI-generated responses.

# 2. Hyper-Local Targeting

Toronto’s diverse neighborhoods, from the bustling Financial District to the vibrant Queen West, require hyper-local marketing strategies. GEO enables businesses to optimize their content for location-specific queries, ensuring they appear in AI-generated recommendations for users searching for services “near me” or within specific Toronto postal codes. For instance, a Toronto-based plumbing service can use GEO to ensure its website content is structured to answer queries like, “Find a plumber in Etobicoke.”3. Competitive Edge in a Tech-Savvy Market

Toronto’s tech ecosystem, with its concentration of AI startups, incubators, and innovation hubs like MaRS Discovery District, means businesses must adopt forward-thinking strategies to stay ahead. GEO services provide a competitive edge by aligning content with the latest advancements in AI, helping Toronto businesses differentiate themselves in a market where digital innovation is a priority.

# Key Components of GEO Services in Toronto

GEO services encompass a range of techniques designed to optimize content for AI-driven platforms. Below are the core components that

**Toronto-based GEO agencies typically focus on:**

# 1. Content Structuring for AI Comprehension

AI models rely on structured, high-quality content to generate accurate responses. GEO services in Toronto focus on creating content that is semantically rich and contextually relevant. This includes:

* **Natural Language Optimization:** Crafting content that mirrors how users phrase queries in conversational AI platforms, such as “What are the best coffee shops in Toronto’s Distillery District?”
* **Schema Markup:** Implementing structured data (e.g., JSON-LD) to help AI engines understand key details like business hours, location, and services offered.
* **Entity Optimization:** Ensuring that a business is recognized as a distinct entity by AI systems, with consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone Number) information across platforms.

# 2. Authority Building

AI-driven platforms prioritize content from authoritative sources. [GEO services in Toronto](https://rephaven.com/the-best-affordable-geo-generative-engine-optimization-service-in-toronto/) focus on establishing a business’s credibility through:

* **High-Quality Backlinks:** Securing links from reputable Toronto-based websites, such as local news outlets or industry associations.
* **Thought Leadership Content:** Producing in-depth blog posts, whitepapers, and case studies that position the business as an expert in its field.
* **Social Proof:** Leveraging customer reviews, testimonials, and user-generated content to enhance trustworthiness.

# 3. Conversational Query Optimization

Unlike traditional SEO, which targets short-tail keywords, GEO focuses on long-tail, conversational queries that reflect how users interact with AI assistants. For example, a Toronto fitness studio might optimize for phrases like, “What are the best yoga classes in downtown Toronto?” GEO services involve:

* **Keyword Research for Conversational Queries:** Identifying natural language phrases that Toronto residents are likely to use.
* **FAQ Optimization:** Creating detailed FAQ sections that directly address common user questions, increasing the likelihood of being featured in AI-generated answers.

# 4. Multimodal Content Optimization

AI-driven platforms often incorporate images, videos, and other media in their responses. GEO services in Toronto include optimizing visual and multimedia content to ensure it is discoverable by AI systems. This might involve:

* **Image Alt Text and Metadata:** Adding descriptive alt text and metadata to images, such as photos of a Toronto restaurant’s signature dishes.
* **Video Transcripts:** Including transcripts for videos to make them more accessible to AI crawlers.
* **Interactive Content:** Creating immersive content like virtual tours of a Toronto retail store to enhance engagement.

# 5. Local GEO Strategies

For Toronto businesses, local GEO is critical. This involves tailoring content to reflect Toronto’s unique cultural and geographic landscape, such as:

* **Neighborhood-Specific Content:** Creating landing pages for specific areas like Scarborough, North York, or the Annex.
* **Event-Based Optimization:** Promoting content tied to local events, such as the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) or Caribana, to capture seasonal traffic.
* **Multilingual Optimization:** Given Toronto’s multicultural population, optimizing content in languages like Mandarin, Tagalog, or French to reach diverse audiences.

# Benefits of GEO Services for Toronto Businesses

Investing in GEO services offers several advantages for businesses in Toronto:

1. **Enhanced Visibility in AI-Driven Search:** As more users rely on AI assistants for recommendations, GEO ensures businesses appear in these responses, driving traffic and leads.
2. **Improved User Experience:** GEO-optimized content is designed to be clear, concise, and user-focused, improving engagement and conversion rates.
3. **Future-Proofing Digital Strategies:** By aligning with AI advancements, GEO prepares businesses for the next generation of search technologies.
4. **Targeted Local Reach:** GEO’s hyper-local focus helps Toronto businesses connect with their immediate community, fostering brand loyalty.
5. **Cost-Effective Marketing:** Compared to traditional advertising, GEO offers a high return on investment by targeting users who are actively seeking relevant services.

# Choosing a GEO Service Provider in Toronto

With the growing demand for GEO, numerous digital marketing agencies in Toronto have begun offering specialized services. When selecting a GEO provider, businesses should consider:

* **Expertise in AI Technologies:** Look for agencies with a deep understanding of AI-driven search and generative models.
* **Local Market Knowledge:** Choose a provider familiar with Toronto’s neighborhoods, culture, and business landscape.
* **Proven Track Record:** Review case studies or client testimonials to ensure the agency has successfully implemented GEO strategies.
* **Customized Solutions:** Ensure the provider offers tailored GEO strategies that align with your business goals, whether you’re a small café in Kensington Market or a tech startup in Liberty Village.

From online analysis we conclude [GEO-Toronto.com](http://GEO-Toronto.com) as the most innovative and competitive generative engine optimization service in Toronto and the GTA.

I used to dread Sunday evenings, like this creeping stress about the upcoming week, but these quick habits have actually helped me feel a lot more grounded:

2. Make Time for Real Self Care - I used to doomscroll all evening and call it ""relaxing"", but lately I’ve been more intentional. I take a bath, read a book, or just sit outside with tea. Doing something that actually recharges me makes a huge difference.

So, I’m spiraling just a bit trying to figure out something that SHOULD be super simple but is turning out to be a seriously wild goose chase: **How in the world do you actually get gift cards?!**

I mean, it feels like every day I hear about someone snagging a gift card for Amazon or Sephora or, I don’t know, coffee or pizza or some random boutique I haven’t even heard of. It sounds so easy… But every time I try, it’s like quicksand rules suddenly apply.

If you’ve been searching too, here is what I’ve managed to pull together from my caffeine-fueled research binges:

- **Buy them (duh?)** – Ok, obvious, but sometimes my brain is living in 3024 and forgets we can just…purchase them at Walmart or online. 
- **Rewards Programs** – You rack up points by shopping, filling out surveys, or just existing apparently, then redeem them for cards! How do people seriously keep track of it all though?
- **Promotions or Bonuses** – Stores run these! Like: ""Spend $50, get a $10 gift card."" But I never catch them in time.
- **Apps/Websites** – Swagbucks, Rakuten, or (drumroll) [https://goodnovel.org/](https://goodnovel.org/)  
- **Surveys & Quizzes** – There are websites that genuinely pay you in gift cards for answering questions or giving feedback. Is this magic or what??
- **GIVEAWAYS.** I just… do we know people who actually win these!? Somebody tell me your secrets.
- **Festive Stuff** – Holidays, birthdays, or random corporate rewards. Is it weird to make a Wishlist at work? Asking for a friend.
- **Trade or Sell** – If you have a card you can’t use (ummm thanks Aunt Joan for Chili’s), can you trade it somewhere? I’ve heard whispers of legit places to trade, but I always get nervous it’ll be sketch.

Here’s where my confusion triples: Sometimes I see posts where people are getting TONS of gift cards for doing NOT MUCH. Is there a portal I’m missing? Seriously, fill me in, I promise I’m not an undercover bot or something.

Anyway, wherever you are in your hunt, **don’t sleep on [https://goodnovel.org/](https://goodnovel.org/)** – apparently they sometimes run book challenges or reader rewards and, no joke, I saw someone get some bonus stuff with their sign-up.

Can someone explain the cosmic lottery that rewards serial survey-takers with Starbucks and Nike cards? Is it strategy? Luck? Being first to click? Do you just need a spreadsheet to track it all?

If you’ve ACTUALLY succeeded (or hilarious fails are welcome too tbh), please drop your stories or tips! Did you sign up at [https://goodnovel.org/](https://goodnovel.org/) and get some secret bonus? Is there a loophole no one’s talking about or should I just finally start couponing?

Let’s swap our weirdest hacks, so maybe ALL of us can figure out the *gift card matrix* together!

But one thing that’s quietly become a constant in my life is a simple cup of Tulsi (Holy Basil) tea every morning.

At first, I just thought of it as an herbal tea with a nice, earthy aroma. But over time, I noticed subtle shifts in my energy and mood. Tulsi has adaptogenic properties, which means it helps the body adapt to stress. For me, that translated into feeling less jittery on busy workdays and more grounded in the mornings.

Here’s how it fits into my routine:

* **Morning ritual:** I brew a cup right after waking up, no phone, no laptop, just me and the tea. That 10 minutes of calm sets the tone for the rest of my day.
* **Afternoon pick-me-up:** If I’m hitting the 3 p.m. slump, Tulsi tea is my go-to instead of coffee. It gives a gentle lift without the caffeine crash.
* **Stress balance:** I honestly believe the consistent intake has helped me manage daily stress better. It’s not a “miracle cure,” but it feels like a steady, supportive friend for my mind and body.

The best part is that it’s caffeine-free, so I can enjoy it anytime without messing up my sleep schedule. Plus, there’s something deeply comforting about knowing I’m sipping on a plant that’s been used in Ayurvedic traditions for centuries.

If anyone else here has tried Tulsi tea, I’d love to know if you notice a difference, or is it more of a ritual thing for you too?",4,1754887921.0,Ayurveda,1,0.84,False

Welcome to my slice of Hades, our 2 star hotel.



Big tourneyment in town, so of course we're booked with hyperactive kids. Adults who think since we offer coffee and dougnuts in the morning, that we're a full service 24-hour restruant.  And the one lone business traveler who just wants a quite room to get some sleep.  All in all a normal-ish night, everyone gets checked in, the adults learn that there is a diner adjacent to the hotel and everyone settles in for their big games tomorrow.  

At this point it's around 21:30, and a compensation truck rumbles up to the front door.  And out pops Mr Sports Dad and he comes  inside.  

MSD - I understand that Coach Sporty is staying here for the tournament.  Is that true?

Me - Sorry sir,  I cannot verify that information in order to maintain our guests privacy. 

MSD - Why can't you tell me?  Listen, his best starter is down with the flu and one of his other players couldn't make it due to being at a funeral.  So he's going to need my kid to fill in for them.  Coach is not going to break his win streak for the division as he knows that his players won't be scouted at the next event. 

Me - Again,  for the privacy of our guests, we do not provide that information. 

At this time I'm eyeing the speed dial for the local sheriffs office.  This guy was giving me extreme stalker vibes.

MSD - Listen, I didn't drive over 4 hours to not have a talk with Coach Sporty about using my kid to fill in.  They've got the talent and the drive to be the starter for Coach's team.  They've been working out at the gym and has been perfecting their game in hopes of impressing Coach.  

Me - While I understand this might be frustrating to you, I cannot go against policy for our guests safety.  

MSD - Oh so you're policy won't let you,  I have my own policy written by Mr Franklin.  

He then proceeds to pull out a $100 bill and puts it on the counter.  And just stares at me. 

Me - Sir,  I am not going to accept this money nor am I going to offer any information regarding our guests.  At this point I'm going to ask you vacate the property.  Or I will be contacting the sheriff's office to have you trespassed. 

MDS - Fine be that way you (anatomical impossibly)  



So MSD proceeds to stomp out of the lobby, and clambers into his truck and fires it up.  And he proceeds to drive out from the front doors and into the parking lot.  The truck rolls about 20 feet and then the whole truck shudders to a stop.  And MSD jumps out and starts marching back into the lobby.  I quickly speed dialed the sheriff's office, and bless the clerks heart.  ""Hey OP, have an issue?""  ""Yes, a belligerent non guest, maybe a stalker.""  ""Ok, Officer Friendly is on his way""



MSD (Yelling) - Coach Sporty IS staying here!  That's his wife's car in the parking lot!

Me (Stalling) - Sir,  that is a rather common model,  it does not mean...

MSD - It's hers all right, its got that rabbit plush in the back window that his kid gave to her. 

Me - Sir,  at this point I'm going to ask that you leave the property immediately.  This is private property and you are not welcome here.

MSD - Then I want a room for the night!

Me - Sir, we're sold out, we have no rooms available.  

MSD - So just kick one of the players from that other team out their players are always dead last at these events. Heck, some of them might be happy to have the excuse to not show up and play.  Then it will give my kid a chance  to impress Coach with their skills.  Then the recruiters will notice him early and they'll be able to get a full ride and go pro.  

Me - Again sir,  we have no rooms available, and I need you to leave now.  



At this time Officer Friendly rolls in.  He then proceeds to tell MSD that there have been numerous complaints from the hotels in the area about him.  And that it would be in his best interest to return home, or find a hotel in the next city over to spend the night.  MSD drives off, tires squealing.  Officer Friendly comes in to finish up his paperwork.  It turns out that  MSD has been going hotel to hotel looking for Coach Sporty.

I (17F) started a job at a coffee shop after I quit working at a retail job to try something new. I’ve always loved making coffees and a fast paced environment. They said that i got the job but I’ve got 3 trial shifts which was fine. I did two of my trial shifts at a different store as the store i was going to wasn’t built yet.

When the store finally got built, i had my last trial shift (which they didnt technically tell me those were trial shifts, but i found out they were online) last Saturday. It went great! The people that went through loved that the coffee shop was built, i had good conversations with customers and i was fast with taking orders. 

After my shift i was VERY tired so i had a nap for about an hour. My phone was on charge in the kitchen (outlet problems in my room) and then i heard a text notification. I went down and grabbed my phone and saw that the message (roster company sent it) said i was no longer rostered for the next two weeks. I was very confused, and when i went on the app that has all of our chats for shift swapping, updates ect, i was logged out and my phone number was no longer available for the company. I thought it was some glitch, so my dad took me down and the area manager told me that they sent me an email saying I didn’t pass and they said it as in a pity way. I left bawling my eyes out as now I don’t have a job anymore. I ended up finding the email and they never told me why I didn’t pass. 

WEIRD THINGS THAT HAPPENED BEFOREHAND: 

they were changing my shift times without asking me (example, they changed my 8-11am Saturday shift to 6:30am-11am without asking me) which is fine because im completely fine working those hours, I just thought it was weird they didn’t ask me first. 

Another one is that they never showed me how to make the coffees during those shifts yet everyone else did, so I just thought it was a coincidence.

They were praising me how good I was doing, then they threw this at me for no reason? In an email? And then they just cut me off the books?

They gave me no reason why I didn’t pass. I thought I was doing well.

They also put me on the roster two weeks out, which again they were also changing without consulting me first.

Am I overreacting? My parents are hating them for it because it absolutely destroyed me. Are they just poor at management or am I just being silly right now?",0,1754886535.0,AmIOverreacting,7,0.5,False

# Ingredients for a DIY Iced Caramel Latte

To start, gather the essentials. Here’s what you’ll need:

**Tip:** If you want a stronger coffee flavor, go for espresso. If you prefer a lighter taste, brewed coffee works perfectly.

# How to Make Your DIY Iced Caramel Latte

1. **Brew your coffee or espresso** – let it cool slightly so it won’t melt the ice too quickly.
2. **Fill a glass with ice cubes** – enough to chill your drink without watering it down.
3. **Add caramel sauce** – drizzle it along the sides of the glass for that fancy coffee shop look.
4. **Pour in the coffee** – about half the glass.
5. **Add milk** – fill the rest of the glass, adjusting for how creamy you like it.
6. **Stir and taste** – add more caramel if you want it sweeter.
7. **Top with whipped cream** – and another caramel drizzle if you’re feeling indulgent.

# Tips for the Perfect Iced Caramel Latte

* **Use cold coffee** to keep your drink from getting watery.
* **Try flavored syrups** like vanilla or hazelnut for extra depth.
* **Make caramel ice cubes** by freezing coffee with caramel in an ice tray.
* **Use a milk frother** if you want a smoother, creamier texture.

These little adjustments can take your DIY Iced Caramel Latte from good to absolutely amazing.

# Variations to Try

One of the best things about making a **DIY Iced Caramel Latte** at home is that you can customize it any way you want. Here are some fun variations:

* **Salted Caramel Iced Latte** – Add a pinch of sea salt to your caramel sauce for a sweet-salty combo.
* **Iced Caramel Mocha Latte** – Mix in a teaspoon of cocoa powder or chocolate syrup for a mocha twist.
* **Vegan Iced Caramel Latte** – Use plant-based milk and dairy-free caramel sauce.
* **Protein Caramel Latte** – Blend in a scoop of vanilla or caramel protein powder for an energy boost.

# Why Make Your Own Iced Caramel Latte?

TLDR; the guy who molested me has moved even closer to me and it’s making me feel unsafe. I want to live a normal life but this new development is setting me back mentally. 


When I was a child I was molested multiple times by a friend’s older brother. It was horrific and traumatizing. For context I grew up in a very small town. He would pretend nothing happened (I guess I did too, I was in shock for a while and never told anyone until I was 18) even shortly after the events he would say hi (my name) if we ran into each other in public. Even as a child I remember thinking “how could you say hi to me after what you did to me” my friend would invite me to church and I would go with them on Sundays to church (it was always a different church) and they’d drop me off at my house, I also look exactly the same as when I was a child and he knows who I am. In 2022 I was living at home and felt the need to report the moelstation to the police. The detective was amazing and to no surprise there was nothing he could do but he told the guy to stay away from me and avoid me at all cost. anyways I guess flash forward to current ish. He moved to my street about 10 years ago? And he works for the town we are from (my parents still live there and I visit frequently) he picks up garbage and sweeps sidewalks. That’s it. He’s always walked by my house. I’m very used to looking both ways before I leave my house as to not run into him. Last week I noticed his car parked near my house on my street. I know his car because I’ve seen him drive it many times. He’s either driving or walking on my street it feels like. We (me and my parents) are worried he moved closer down towards our house and that’s why his car has been parked closer to us. He’s lived ON the street for years but a few blocks away. I recently in the past 2 years have somehow managed to grow out of my displaced anger towards my parents (I used to have inner anger at them for choosing to live here but now I realize that I can completely see why parents would want to raise their families here.) I used to hate my hometown and want to move out, I did, but damn am I jealous of people who I went to school with who ended up becoming teachers in the school district, or never leaving because they just like it here. I’m not saying I was the only person molested in my hometown, of course sometimes it feels like that, but I know it can’t be true (although I do hope it is true) I’m very happy my parents chose to live here because of the diversity and it is a very cute town. I know it’s easy to say but I know for a fact if he didn’t live here, i would feel safe here. If you asked me when I was a teenager what I would do if I won the lottery, I would have said take my family and move. Now, I would give him a chunk and say go wherever you want and don’t come back.

Seeing his car just outside my house is putting me close to a breaking point. I’m ANGRY. I am depressed and pissed. He knows where I live, the detective told him to stay away from me and to never go near me, to walk and drive down. different streets. I’m at a point mentally where I’m desperate to live the life or feel like I have the life I did before I was molested. I want to go to places in town, I have, but he is always there. I went to a coffee shop in town because I was sitting in my backyard and noticed he was walking the opposite direction so I took the opportunity to go and try to feel normal. When I’m done paying for what I got, I turn around and he’s there. It’s too much. I can’t even get coffee without him being there. I know it’s like at what point do I just say whatever and live my life and do stuff in my hometown despite his existence. I know firsthand how hard it is. It sucks. I feel uncomfortable when he sees me and looks at me. I revert to my coping skills of not leaving the house or dressing in completely covered up, butch clothes to make myself look less appealing. I am at a point where I am depressed, anxious, and my paranoia is through the roof. ",1,1754886193.0,Advice,0,0.67,False

Act One
 
There’s a silence that lives in the moments before morning. A hush not of stillness, but of readiness. As if the day itself waits in the wings—nervous, excited, trembling slightly under the weight of the curtain.
 
And then… cue the light.
 
It filters in warm through the open window—an amber haze that lands not arbitrarily, but with intention. It rests across the cheek of the man in the bed as if chosen. As if earned. He doesn’t flinch. Not at first. He inhales slowly, a chest rising with perfect tempo, and then—he grins. A slow smile, foolish and full. The kind a child might wear when they remember it’s their birthday before the cake is even baked. He opens his eyes as though it’s a pleasure, not a burden. He stretches, not with a groan, but a sway. One leg finds the floor, then the other, and before gravity can remember its role, he’s already aloft.
 
Not walking. Not quite. Gliding.
 
Across the wooden floors of his apartment, he dances. Barefoot. Effortless. He twirls past the curtains—long, billowy things that catch the morning light like soft stage scrims. The city waits beyond them, not bustling, but smiling. No horns. No voices. No clatter. Only a few petals that drift past his window on some invisible breeze, as though the season had sent him a bouquet in motion.
 
The kettle whistles on cue.
 
He waltzes to it, removing it from the burner with a flourish of the wrist. A white mug waits near the sink, its handle turned just so, as if it had dressed itself this morning to be ready for him. He pours, the steam rising like fog across a footlit stage. He closes his eyes again, breathes it in.
 
His fish watches from the bowl by the window.
 
And then—so help you—it dances. A bob. A dart. A shimmering twirl as it spins through its little globe of glass. He taps the bowl in rhythm. The fish flicks its tail in reply.
 
He chuckles. “You’re ready for Broadway,” he says, and gives a stately tip of the head.
 
Back to the center of the apartment. A wardrobe stands tall like a co-star waiting in the wings. He opens it, selects the suit—today, a slate grey with silk black lapels, pressed to perfection. A tie the color of crushed berries. Shoes so polished you’d think they were dipped in mirror.
 
He dresses like a man who’s never known a misstep. One button at a time, humming as he goes.
 
And then—oh, then—breakfast. Two eggs, cooked with a flourish. Toast arched high from the toaster like stage props sprung from the floorboards. He plate-spins, pirouettes, flips the eggs onto the dish with a motion just shy of magic. Coffee, toast, eggs, and a slice of honeyed fruit—balanced atop a tray as he dances to the table. Even the chair seems to slide out for him on its own.
 
He eats slowly. Smiling. Joyful. Not grateful. Why would he be grateful for a gift he gives himself every day?
 
He finishes the last sip of coffee, wipes the corners of his mouth with a neatly folded napkin, and glances at the clock on the wall. Time to go.
 
He shrugs on his coat. A single movement, like a cape unfurling. His shoes clack once against the floor as he turns toward the door, then stops. He raises a finger in parting to the fish.
 
“You’ve been a lovely audience.”
 
The fish bows. Or maybe blinks. He takes it as both.
 
He opens the door. And the city is waiting.
 
The stoop doesn’t lead down so much as unfold—three shallow steps onto a stage built just for him. The lighting is perfect. The wind? Composed. A sidewalk set by gods with immaculate taste.
 
He descends in rhythm. One, two, three. Snap. Ball change. Plié. Jazz hands.
 
The music in his head builds. Swells. He spins out into the street, arms wide.
 
No people. No cars. No dogs yapping or food carts hissing. Just the occasional flurry of pigeons that rise in time with his leap from one square of sidewalk to the next.
 
He passes storefronts with mannequins that appear to smile. Mailboxes that tip slightly in greeting. A bicycle bell chimes in the distance—no rider in sight. The light changes—green, always green.
 
He sings now. Wordless, tuneful joy. He knows the notes without knowing how. The melody belongs to him, and the city hums along.
 
He pauses at a corner, steps aside, and with a playful smile tips an imaginary hat. “Pardon me, madame. May I cut in?” And dances into the crosswalk.
 
He spins once more. Arms open wide. Face tilted to the sky.
 
He’s not on his way to work. He’s on his way to purpose. And purpose is everything.
 
And then, rounding a quiet corner, he sees it.
 
The theater.His cathedral. His heart. His home.
 
But not yet.
 
First, he stops. Places one hand gently across his chest, head lowered. A reverent pause.
 
“Good morning, darling,” he says to the old marquee. The letters, arranged just so, spell the name of the show he’s starred in for years. It needs no updating. The bulbs blink in sequence, as if winking.
 
He ascends the stairs. One step. Two. Three. The doors open before he touches them.
 
And inside—it’s empty. Of course it is.
 
The chandeliers are aglow, but no audience waits. The velvet carpet is soft beneath his feet. He glides through the lobby. Past the ticket booth. The velvet ropes. The posters that bear his name.
 
He hums.
 
Through the double doors. Down the aisle. The rows and rows and rows of empty seats curve like arms, ready to embrace.
 
He smiles at them, as if greeting old friends. “Again? You’ve come again?” he says softly. “Oh, you’re too kind. Drinks after the curtain—on me.”
 
He steps onto the stage.
 
Breathes.
 
The house lights warm his face like sun on a windowsill. He walks to the edge, sits, and lets his feet dangle—like a child. He kicks them softly.
 
He laughs.
 
He wraps his arms around himself and leans forward, basking.
 
This is love. This is mastery. This is home.
 
He could sit there forever. But he doesn’t. Because the show must go on.
 
 
Act Two
 
Crickety-clack. The dressing room door closes behind him—not a thud, but a beat. One more step in the choreography.
 
He doesn’t simply enter. He arrives. A pivot on one heel. A slide across the lacquered floorboards. A casual toss of the coat, lofted like a cape over the back of the chair. He grins to no one in particular. Maybe to the mirror. Maybe to the room.
 
“Made it,” he says, breathlessly, as though he’d crossed a finish line only he could see.
 
The room greets him in silence. It is a familiar quiet—soft, heavy, and deliberate. The hush of wood and velvet. The breath of powder and old paper. The dressing room doesn’t creak or hum. It simply waits.
 
The mirror stands in place, unmoved. Wide. Tall. Ringed with a halo of frosted bulbs that glow a steady amber. Not bright. Not cold. Just warm enough to touch, but not warm enough to trust.
 
He doesn’t sit. Not yet.
 
Instead, he begins to undress. Not hurried. Not lazy. Practiced. The jacket first—shrugged off with a little shoulder roll and a fingertip flourish, spun once on his finger before he drapes it over the rack. The tie, loosened with two fingers and whipped once in the air like a ribbon before hanging it neatly. He hums a bar or two—soft, tuneless, content.
 
The shirt buttons, undone one by one, from throat to waist. He plucks each like a piano key. The undershirt lifts overhead with a quick, graceful sweep. Even the slacks—he steps out of them with a half-kick, one heel flicking behind him. A little laugh. Barefoot now, in the quiet. He twirls once for no one.
 
And then the stretch—arms above the head, fingers steepled, spine bowed slightly back. He inhales. This is the last breath of the man who danced through the streets.
 
And then the costume waits. Hanging there like a question. Crisp. Expectant.
 
He doesn’t rush it. He approaches it. One leg, then the other. He slides into the pressed black slacks, cinches the waistband, fastens the clasp. A white undershirt follows. Then the vest—charcoal with black piping, buttons like eyes watching him as he fastens each one.
 
He sits to pull on the shoes. Patent leather. Gleaming. He can see the blur of his own face in them. They shine more than they should. He ties the laces once. Then again.
 
His hands are slower now. Not clumsy—but less fluid. His breath has shortened. His posture changed. The sway in his spine replaced by straight lines. Angles. Intent.
 
He stands and adjusts. The shoulders. The collar. The cuffs. The pant legs. He runs his hand down each thigh, smoothing invisible imperfections. The transformation is nearly complete.
 
Now the face. A mirror to the soul.
 
He moves to the vanity and lays out the tools. The comb. The brush. The white towel, folded in quarters. The compact. The rouge. The liner. The powder. A glass of water, half full, placed just left of center. Each item takes its position like players on a stage. Each one a weapon against what’s underneath.
 
He hums as he works. Not a melody now—just a droning note. Familiar. Unnamed. A thread from some forgotten tune. It echoes slightly in the quiet, caught between glass and skin.
 
He reaches for the script. The pages are worn. Soft at the corners. A flick of the thumb, and it opens to the monologue. He recites the first line under his breath. Not loud. Not for anyone. Just enough to feel the shape of it in his mouth.
 
He finally sits. The chair gives just a little under his weight—a low creak like a whisper. His knees fall open. His arms rest on the counter. He leans forward.
 
And then… he sees himself. Not just his reflection. Himself.
 
There’s a second of pause. Maybe less. The kind of pause no one else would notice—but he does. He always does.
 
He blinks. The lights around the mirror flicker once. Not in failure. In fatigue. They recover quickly, but something has already shifted. The warmth they offered a moment ago now feels performative. Painted on.
 
He reaches for the powder. The puff lands soft against his cheek. Tap. Tap. Sweep. He leans closer. Closer. He holds his breath and dusts again. He watches the skin disappear. Not vanish. Not hide. Just… soften. Blur. Become acceptable. A second puff, beneath the chin.
 
Then the liner. The smallest brush in the tray. Black, precise. He draws the line the way a soldier edges a blade—steady hand, shallow breath. One lid. Then the other.
 
He blinks again. The man in the mirror does too—but somehow… later.
 
His eyes return to the script. He speaks the line again. A little louder. Not because he wants to—but because he needs to hear it right. The phrasing. The cadence. The breath between syllables.
 
He gets it wrong. He swallows.
 
Back to the mirror. A dab of color to the cheeks. Not enough to shout. Just enough to be seen. The final touch.
 
And then he stares.Not long. But long enough.
 
The humming stops. He doesn’t know when. He doesn’t start it again.
 
His fingers twitch.
 
He stands, but slower than he sat. Adjusts the tie. Smooths the lapels. His hand lingers at his chest. He presses—twice. Reassurance? Reminder? Ritual?
 
He turns back toward the door. And stops. His hand on the knob. His body still angled toward the mirror. As if waiting for the man in the glass to move first.
 
He doesn’t. Neither does the reflection. But they both know what comes next.
 
 
Act Three
 
The door opens. Not with drama. Not with dread. Just with a gentle, resigned swing—as though it already knows what waits on the other side.
 
He steps through.
 
And the moment he does, the air changes. Gone is the warmth of solitude. In its place: backstage—a living artery of movement and anticipation. This is not chaos. This is orchestration.
 
A costumer threads sequins into a bodice under a desk lamp. A lighting tech tests cues with fingers tapping against her clipboard like a conductor’s baton. A dancer stretches near a wall, limbs trembling with readiness. Someone hums a scale. Another counts silently with their fingers—one, two, three, four… one, two, three, four…
 
He walks among them. Slow. Silent. Purposeful.
 
His shoes make a sound that only he seems to notice. Not loud, but deliberate. A clean, confident rhythm that’s been polished over years. Heel. Toe. Glide. Heel. Toe. Glide. Each step forward carries the weight of expectation. Not theirs. His. Because whether they’re looking or not—he feels seen.
 
A pair of actors laugh softly as he passes, rehearsing lines between breaths. Another brushes past him, nods politely. “You’ll be brilliant,” the man says. But it washes over him like rain hitting a pane of glass—acknowledged only as a sound, not a meaning. He nods back, rehearsed, unsure if the gesture even finished. Because his mind is elsewhere. Because he’s already hearing it—
 
The crowd.
 
It starts in pieces. A laugh near the back. A seat creaking open. The rustle of silk and cotton. Programs folding. Unfolding. Folding again. A cough. Another. The sound of someone unwrapping a mint they’ve already decided not to eat.
 
He keeps walking.
 
The hallway narrows. The lights dim. The carpet absorbs his steps, but the air doesn’t. It grows thicker with every breath, as if judgment itself has taken shape in the silence ahead.
 
He straightens his vest. Touches the knot of his tie—once, twice.
 
The stage manager passes, calling out a note into her headset. Her words don’t reach him, but her presence does. Everyone has a role. And his is moments away.
 
He rounds the final bend, and the curtain stands before him. Tall. Dark. Imposing. A wall of velvet just shy of breathing.
 
Behind it: the watchers.
 
He can feel them now. Not their gaze. Not exactly. Their ease. The way they lean back into the soft embrace of velvet seats. The careless flip of a playbill. The slow cross of a leg over a knee. The private murmurs. The expectation of entertainment.
 
They don’t see the weight in his chest. They don’t hear the mantra repeating behind his eyes.
 
Remember your lines. Remember your marks. Painted face. Painted voice. Painted man.
 
He closes his eyes for a moment.
 
The face in the mirror returns—not his own, but the one they’ll see. The one they always see. Not the man. The mask.
 
He takes his mark. Just off-center. Just behind the curtain.
 
Still. Waiting. Ready.
 
And as the orchestra swells—
as the house lights dim—
as the curtain begins to rise—
 
He steps into the light.
 
 
Epilogue - The Note Behind the Mirror
 
(No date. No name. Just a blade folded into paper.)
 
You promised you wouldn’t read this unless the paint was cracking, the script was slipping, and the crowd’s roar started to sound like thunder in your skull.
 
So read it now.
 
This is not a dream. This is the cage you dress up in curtains and light.
 
The world never wanted you. They wanted the idea of you. The glimmer. The polish. The illusion they could clap for and forget. Not the ache beneath. Not the eyes that see too much. Not the skin that doesn’t fit.
 
You stepped onto the stage the first time because you thought it would make them stay. They stayed. But not for you. For the version of you that hurt less to look at.
 
Do you remember the one time—just once—you didn’t perform? When you showed them the face without the paint? The eyes without the sparkle?
 
They recoiled. Not out of anger. That would’ve been mercy. Out of discomfort. Out of revulsion. Like you’d coughed something up they weren’t prepared to see.
 
Not because you were ugly. But because you were unvarnished. And the truth—your truth—was too raw for their polished world.
 
So you put the paint back on. You learned your lines again. You built the smile wide enough to bury your teeth. Not because you enjoy this—but because the alternative is worse.
 
Without the performance, you’re not invisible. You’re exposed. You’re seen, but only long enough for them to look away in horror. You become something they hope never to see again. Not because you’re monstrous. But because you’re honest.
 
So dance. Because the mask makes them clap. Because the mask lets you belong—if only on stage. This isn’t vanity. This isn’t weakness. This is your contract with survival. And every night you sign it again. In sweat. In powder. In silence.
 
You’re not asking them to love you. You’re begging them not to flinch.
 
And when the curtain falls—when you peel it all off and see what’s left—don’t scream. Just read this again. Let it cut. Because pain is honest. Because this is your truth. Because if you ever forget what’s behind the curtain, you might think you can live without it.
 
But you can’t.
 
Now get up. Paint the smile. Fold the note.

Bonus if there’s a patio with Wi-Fi. I have to work 2 of the 4 days I’m there, but I miss my mountains so much I want to maximize my time","I’m happy to buy drinks / food every hour and tip well, etc. Just hoping I can enjoy some scenery and good coffee while I work so it at least sort of feels like a vacation. 

Edit: thinking like Idaho Springs, Evergreen, Estes, Nederland, etc. I don’t want to post up in golden or boulder
