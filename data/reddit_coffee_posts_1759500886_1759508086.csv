I moved to the UK when I was 18 so pretty much spent all of my adult life here. However, despite working full-time (not remotely) this entire time, as well as going to college to learn a trade for 3 years, I do not have a friend I can just meet weekly/biweekly, for example for a coffee or a drink at the pub. I chat to lots of people at work/college and we are at friendly terms, but very very rarely we would meet up outside of work. I probably meet up with a few people that live 3 hours away like twice per year. 

  
Since I moved to the UK, I've lived in Hertfordshire and London. For 2 years I put myself out there going raving, gym, library, swimming, pubs, golf etc. I'm a girl in my mid twenties and most people compliment my appearance. I've had no issues with getting into a relationship and finding partners. The thing is I've been in relationships this entire time, and my partners friends always become ""my friends"" and then when we break up, the friendship disappears, because it's awkward. 



Just wondering if this is a normal experience not having any local friends at all? If anything, I find getting into a relationship/having a partner a lot easier than finding actual friends. I have no issue with it, because I'm used to the lack of genuine friendships and treat my partner as my best friend.

1nx3bkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/coralisland/comments/1nx3bkm/coral_island_adviced_needed/,Coral island Adviced needed.,"1) How do you guys manage the time in a day? As well as have the Stamina for everything?

I don't have a kitchen yet or Cooking Utensils, but the only 3 ways I've seen possible solutions for food right now are either (A) Buying Food, (B) Crafting Seeds, Goo, Or Seaweed into Food in Inventory, or (C) sleeping off each day and ignoring Healing back Energy with food.

I've seen guides where people said the coconut drinks from the Traveling Sea Salesperson were a focus, but then also the Donuts from the Coffee Stand were also good energy. If I had a spreadsheet on me with all the food I could buy, I would compare, but money for food is Expensive, I've seen, and the only Item I've used so far for cash was my housing furniture, Bug, and Forageables. Fish, I believe I was able to eat some; otherwise, I kinda sold them and rarely used them as food.

2) I know people prefer the Mines first for tool Upgrades, then the Ocean for other tool upgrades and overall work on the Museum and Alter throughout the season, but still, I don't think I want to focus heavily down that path right now.  
  
I just want to clear my farmland right now, and I don't know what all I need to do that effectively. I've heard Bombs, I've heard Silver Axe and Bronze Pick, I've heard Leaving it for self expansions little by little, but overall, the feeling of clearing the land of clutter keeps making me feel at ease.

3) I know there are MANY ways to play the game and MANY Objectives to work towards but for me, I just want to focus on Alters and Museum (and Clearing My Farmland for designing later) then Income and eventually Automation.  
  
I don't know what that all looks like in my future other than hearing of Autochests, SFH Sprinklers, and Computers, so I am over here just trying to Plan out smaller goals to reach there and dont know where to start or order a list for this game. Ive seen MANY Playthroughs up to spring day 28 just to compare what could I do but all playthroughs are of 1.0 or 1.1 and each playthrough is different cause they are mostly blind playthroughs.

So I kinda need some advice from someone that went down that approach on what would be some objectives to focus on so by the time the roadmap has an update to the game, I can be ready.

  
Hopefully you guys can help give me some advice. it may be a challenge getting used to this game but just know I Really do love this game, I am just always in the mindset of Optimization as a end goal which can sometimes skew with the relaxing feel of the games I play from the Cozy Genre early on due to researching or asking for advice (which I dont mind, I like being Planned and Prepared anyways).",1,1759507651.0,coralisland,1,1.0,False

1nx35c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nx35c3/the_great_dishwasher_debate/,The Great Dishwasher Debate,"I was lowkey ready to lose it over the dishwasher. For real, it’s not that hard, right? You press a button, it cleans, then *someone* needs to empty it. But in our urban apartment, that ""someone"" usually ended up being me. I’d walk into the kitchen, coffee already brewing, and there it would be – a glistening monument of clean dishes, untouched, while the sink accumulated a small mountain of dirty ones, silently judging me.

My roommates, Liam and Chloe, are awesome humans, tbh. Liam’s super chill, always down for a late-night chat about conspiracy theories or whatever new indie game he’s obsessed with. Chloe, my other roommate, is this incredible artist, constantly bringing home new canvases and smelling faintly of turpentine. They’re good people, but when it came to the dishwasher, it was like they had collective amnesia. I tried the passive-aggressive notes, like, ""Clean dishes inside, just saying!"" (No cap, I actually wrote that once.) Chloe just doodled a tiny happy face next to it. Liam probably didn't even see it. I even left the clean dishes in there for three days once, just to see what would happen. What happened was we ran out of clean plates. I broke first.

It wasn't just the dishes, though. It was the feeling of being the default planner, the silent keeper of the household peace. I found myself sighing more, my mental tally of ""who did what"" growing longer by the day. One evening, after a particularly long day at work, I walked in to find both of them sprawled on the couch, laughing at some TikTok, while the dishwasher was, you guessed it, full and gleaming. I just kind of… snapped. Not yelled, just a quiet, ""Hey guys, can we talk about the kitchen for a sec?""

They both looked up, a little surprised, probably sensing the vibes were off. I explained, as calmly as I could, how I felt like the dishwasher duty kept falling to me, and how it was actually starting to get on my nerves. Liam, to his credit, looked genuinely apologetic. ""Dude, I'm honestly so bad at noticing stuff like that,"" he said, running a hand through his hair. Chloe chimed in, ""Yeah, I just get so focused on my art, then I totally space. My bad, Maya.""

We ended up having an actual conversation, sprawled out on the living room rug. Chloe suggested we try a chore app she’d seen, something that rotates duties and sends reminders. Liam, ever the tech guy, was immediately on board, suggesting a specific one he knew. We decided to give it a go, starting with the dishwasher, then adding a few other recurring tasks like taking out the trash and cleaning the bathroom once a week. It wasn't a magic fix overnight, but honestly, it was a massive improvement.

It sounds small, but that honest conversation and the decision to try a system changed the whole vibe of our apartment. We still have our moments, sure, but now there’s less unspoken resentment and more proactive communication. It taught me that sometimes, you just gotta voice what’s bothering you, even if it feels awkward. And that a shared living space isn't just about sharing rent, it’s about sharing responsibility and building a little community where everyone feels seen. We’re still figuring things out, but we’re doing it together. And for real, we haven’t had a dishwasher debate since.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

The job I was recently hired for started off well but after a while I noticed that my boss, the director of the company, has major issues in terms of communication and respecting rules/boundaries (personal and professional). He has no experience in a kitchen and knows nothing about how it is run, yet comes in and does as he pleases, which is a major source of stress for me. 

One such thing he keeps constantly doing is coming into the kitchen and spending extended time there standing, leaning, trying to talk to us when we are running around like crazy during the busy hours. The issue here is that he does all of this in his outside clothes, so it is a MAJOR health and safety concern. We brought it up to him multiple times gently, and told him to speak to us out the front of the kitchen when it is busy and he keeps ignoring us, i actually ended up having a major argument with him over this the other day and he told me he does what he wants in the kitchen.

Few other things that really wound me up recently about him is he keeps not doing things I tell him he should do or let me handle a situation and just completely not doing anything about it after saying he is going to handle it. We nearly lost an employee because he absolutely refused to call them and get to root of a problem that they had at the time.


Finally he just keeps acting rude and entitled. Last week I had another argument with him because he keeps asking me to make him coffee with my instant coffee I bring from home and he refuses to have anyone else’s. I told him he can make his own coffee for himself, the following day he handed me a whole jar of instant coffee and told me to make it for him, I obviously said no. 

Honestly I have so many more of these stories of him just acting unprofessional and ignorant man. I am not sure how I should approach this situation to put him in his place, especially regarding the first issue with outside clothes, i don’t suppose HR can do anything about it, I’m considering threatening to report his actions to the FSA if I need to but I don’t want to resort to that.

* **Monetize your skills** if you want to host something (like teaching yoga or a skill workshop).

Most profiles are verified, so you know you’re talking to real people.

Belong is already used by over a million people worldwide, with thousands of meetups happening every week, and we’re excited to start building that same energy in Mumbai 🌆

I used a chat, of the gpt, kind to generate the scene and locked the main image and had my team message me where they wanted to hide their penny before the meeting started so I could hide them behind cropped spots of the image.

1nx2v2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1nx2v2n/it_happens_all_the_time/,It Happens All The Time,"This story isn't mine to tell, it was told to me by my best friend. Derek probably wouldn't even want me to tell this story, but I feel that it needs to be told. I got a call from Derek late one night from the hospital. ""I have something I have to tell you."" He sounded desperate, frantic even. 

Derek hit an all-time low point in his life a while before this. This is the kind of trauma that manifests itself in the form of self-destructive tendencies. Being plowed into by a drunk driver shortly after getting married can do that to a man. He lived, she didn't. Needless to say, it drove him into a level of despair that can't be described in words. 

When I arrived at his room he was staring off into space with a blank, distant expression. As he turned to me I realized just how bad he looked. His eyes were bloodshot with bags under them. After a few moments his numb, emotionless demeanor changed into frantic sobs, Without saying a word I wrapped him in a hug and tried to console him. He eventually calmed down enough for me to sit and talk. ""What happened man?"" I asked, as delicately as possible.

He looked at me once again, a pained expression on his face. When he spoke his voice sounded shaky. This is the story he told me.

I guess you could say it all started when she died. I kind of lost motivation to continue the same routine I was used to. I started missing work, shut out my family, and started drinking heavily. After a month or so of the same routine, I subsequently lost my job. Things only got worse. Pills, then eventually heavier drugs took hold. And then this...

My first memory of this experience was being in a stupor one night, the kind that makes you forget where you are momentarily. The room was cold, not uncommon for a seedy motel. I heard a knock at the door, I stood to turn the light on, the dull yellow bulb casting a glow that reminded me of an old sepia-type movie, but as I went to look through the peephole I saw nothing. I opened the door, scanning the breezeway... Nobody was there. 

Shaking my head I shut the door and I walked my way over the cold floor to the bathroom. I had a very strange feeling, like the room around me felt lifeless.

I flipped the switch on the wall, immediately I saw that the bathroom took on the same eerie tone. My reflection stared back at me, making me realize just how exhausted I looked. I took a moment to splash water on my face to clear my thoughts. Suddenly I thought I'd heard something. I stood stock still. I could've sworn I'd heard the shuffling of feet. The bathroom light suddenly turned off.

I was becoming Ill with fear. The light from under the door began to flicker with a strange buzzing sound. I cautiously peeked around the door, like a child with an overactive imagination. 

I had barely peeked around the door when suddenly the light turned off, and now both lights were out, plunging the room into darkness. Just before the light went out I thought I saw a figure in the corner of the room. Creeping cautiously toward the light chain, I fumbled for it in the darkness. I pulled on it and to my unease, nothing happened. I stood motionless, completely freaked out. 

I jumped with a start when the white noise and grey glow of the TV came blaring on again. Then I thought I'd heard something else. Beneath the white noise was a different sound. I stopped and listened. 

The sound was mostly drowned out but it was there. Holding my breath I inched closer to the screen, and as I did so the sound became clearer. Fading in and out was… some sort of screaming. It seemed as though there were dozens of them wailing. I stood there, hand outstretched toward the power button, the sound of agonizing screams rose and fell within the white noise.

Just as I was about to unplug the tv, it turned off on its own. The screen went black. It was too quiet. It seemed as though the silence was even more unnerving than the noise. I slowly inched back toward the light chain. I didn't take my eyes off the TV even though it was pitch black. I was shaking but doing my best to convince myself it was just a faulty tv.

""Piece of shit.""  The sounds of screaming were most likely a horror movie on a channel with a bad signal. I reached for the chain still shaking slightly, praying it would work this time. I sighed with relief as the light came to life. Just as I turned towards the bed, I was met with the breath of something inches from my face.

His complexion was sickly pale, almost matching his gray hair. the face was sunken and emotionless. It was a brief first encounter but I'll remember that face for eternity. At that moment I felt like I was staring death in the face “Don't worry, that happens all the time.” he said. I looked down, in his right hand was a knife, covered in blood. 

Just then the tv came blaring with those awful screams. I can only describe the man in front of me as being a shell of a human, an unbelievably ancient-looking man whose grey hair was long and stringy.

I stood paralyzed as I looked into the black pit where his eyes should be. Suddenly I was aware of another sound, the heavy footsteps of something large could be heard somewhere beyond the door, accompanied by an inhuman wail. Just as soon as I was aware of it, I bolted upright in bed, almost falling off of it… I was at home… 

My heart racing as well as my breathing. My jaw hurt as if I'd been grinding my teeth. It was clearly a nightmare. 

The feeling, though, even now that I was awake in my own home, seemed to linger. I was no stranger to bad dreams, but as far as I can remember, before she died I had never had nightmares such as these.

I swallowed hard realizing my mouth was dry and went downstairs for a glass of water. I racked my brain for any memory that involved the motel In the dream. It felt familiar in a way couldn't grasp as I walked back to my room. 
 
I lay awake thinking about the nightmare,  I couldn't stop thinking about the eyes of the man, or the lack thereof. Other thoughts crept into my mind and eventually drifted toward abstract thoughts as sleep took over. Suddenly the sound of something invaded my eardrums, and for the second time I found myself back in the motel room.

I was immediately aware of the fact that I could only move my eyes as I looked toward the direction of the sound, whatever it was seemed to be coming up the stairs. I could hear several thumps reverberating from the metal stairs. I listened, paralyzed and terrified as I heard the sound growing in volume as it made its way up the stairs, sounding as if it were crawling, accompanied by what could only be described as the cracking and popping of bones. 

As it got closer I could hear the sound of deep gurgling and wheezing, like that of a sickly and choking creature. It stopped just a few feet before the window as I still couldn't see any shadow beyond the curtain, and the light outside my door started to flicker. I heard the sound of a door handle turning, I lay paralyzed in fear,  but as I heard a door creak open I realized that it was coming from the direction of the neighboring room. I still could only move my eyes as I stared toward the flickering light. 

My ears were met by the muffled sound of moaning and confused shouts from the voice of a man through the wall behind me. The shouts evolved into terrified shrieks. I could still hear the thing breathing, only seeming to get more excited. My heart pounded as I could do nothing but listen as the terrified cries turning to muffled screaming, and then gurgled choking accompanied by cracking and wet crunching. 

All sound went quiet aside from the heavy breathing of the thing as I lay in silence still struggling to move. Once again I heard the footsteps of the thing as it seemed to leave the room. I prayed silently that it wouldn't come my way. 

My eyes were shut tight for what seemed like an eternity until I realized that everything was silent. Opening my eyes I looked first toward the window, still unable to move my body, the light was no longer flickering beyond the curtain. 

I looked to the edge of the bed, and to my horror, there stood the old man, illuminated only by the light from the breezeway. ""Don't worry, that happens all the time."" That's when I heard a tapping, slowly looked in the direction of the window and saw a silhouette that was unlike anything I'd seen, humanoid in shape, yet it was anything but human, it looked as though it was standing, only with its back hunched over. It was standing at an angle where I could see an unnaturally long neck with it's head seemingly facing toward me.

Something smashed against the window with a crunch, leaving a dark splatter on the other side. I would have screamed if only I had the ability. With another sickening splat, I could make out the form of what was being slammed into the window… The shape of a human head was being held by the hair. ""Please stop"" I prayed silently. 

Almost as if the thing reacted to my thoughts, it immediately stopped. In a raspy, distorted voice, the thing spoke ""you couldn't imagine the things he will do to you."" Dropping the mangled head, it moved away from the window, and towards the door to my room. I laid paralyzed as the handle twisted. 

I was awake almost immediately, woken by the sound of thunder. I reached over to turn on the bedside lamp, to realize that it wouldn't turn on. ""Of course"" I'd said aloud. The storm had knocked out the power. All was silent except for the sound of rain and thunder. I looked at my phone to find that it was 3 a.m.

I rubbed my eyes trying to shake the residual sense of unease. Sitting in the darkness wasn't helping at all, so I decided to go downstairs and to the front porch to see if the other houses had lost power. 

I sat on the porch and watched the rain as it poured, all other houses were dark. What struck me as odd was that all of the houses seemed vacant, no cars in the driveways. And then I looked down the street towards the end of the block. I noticed the vague form of something in the road. 
The sky was a dark with storm clouds, the only illumination was that of the moon behind the thick clouds, casting an eerie glow upon them. With a flash of lightning I caught a glimpse of a figure standing at the end of the block in the middle of the road. I squinted to try and make out any details. It looked to be the figure of a very tall man. 

After a few moments of squinting into the dark wall of rain I began to turn back towards the door, but just as I did a flash once again illuminated the figure in the road, only much closer. It seemed like the only way for him to be that much closer was as if he was sprinting down the road toward me. 

I took a few steps back, my hand finding the door knob, still staring in the direction of the figure. My eyes were trained on the spot I'd last seen the figure, and as another flash lit the sky I saw nothing. I turned the knob and went inside, locking the door behind me. 

I wiped the rain from my face with a sigh, feeling the weight of exhaustion. I sat on the couch and laid my head back, staring through the darkness. I thought of my wife, and the last time I'd seen her face. I didn't like the darkness, nor the quiet, for fear of being left with my thoughts. I felt like I had to keep moving, at least until the power came back. Maybe I was afraid of the nightmares to creep their way back in.

I don't know how long I'd paced until I decided to call the electric company. It rang a few times before being forwarded to a message, ""if you're experiencing a power outage, please be patient, we're in the process of fixing the issue."" Just as I took the phone from my ear I thought I'd heard something. ""Don't worry, it happens all the time"". I put the phone back to my ear ""Power outages are common during this weather, we will have your electricity restored as soon as possible.""

As eerie as it was to hear those words, I had to chalk it up to a coincidence. I sat down on the couch in the dark, with only the flashing of lightning illuminating my surroundings. My eyes were heavy. Thoughts began to blur together as sleep took me despite my attempts to prevent it. 

I found myself walking down a road, on either side were nothing but tall trees. The woods were thick and rarely were there any breaks to seeing you much of anything beyond the treeline. The road stretched on and on with no end in sight. Looking to my right I realized my wife and I were holding hands. 

She gazed straight ahead smiling, I couldn't take my eyes off her. It was lightly raining, reminding me of the walks we used to take. Suddenly she stopped walking and her smile faded, her expression turning serious. “You need  to wake up.” I followed her gaze. 

Down the road about a football field away I saw a figure. It looked familiar, like the one I'd seen on the lightning-lit road. Freakishly tall and emaciated, its arms were longer than any human, as were the legs. As terrifying as it was, I didn't want to leave. “I don't want to wake up.” I said a bit choked up. “No I mean really... wake up.” She said. 

Looking ahead again I was startled by the fact that the thing was noticeably closer. Its head cocked to one side and its torso contorted at an inhuman angle. “I don't…” I trailed off. Looking left, I found that the trees were gone, and in their place was the familiar motel building from my previous nightmare.

There was only one building and had only twelve rooms for each of the two floors, rusted metal stairs led up to the second floor. The only other building was the dilapidated office. 

My attention was caught by the windows of the eerie place. The curtains were drawn to reveal the darkness,  but I could see the faint silhouettes of someone or something. It seemed as though they occupied every window of the building. 

A flicker of yellow light flashed from within a room on the second floor, the faint flash illuminated the same man from my dream. His eyeless gaze focused directly on me, as I looked forward again, the creature was maybe 50 yards away now. I stood terrified as it emitted an inhuman wail. It seemed like a blanket of darkness followed it. I looked back at my wife, suddenly her mouth opened, emitting a loud sound of white noise. My eyes snapped open. 

The sound of my phone ringing woke me. It was my brother. I hesitated, I wanted to talk to someone, to anyone, but how do you explain to someone that you may or may not be insane?

After a few moments, the ringing stopped and I sighed. I stared at my phone, contemplating whether or not I should call back. Just as I reached for the phone it rang once more, making me jump.

""hey bro what's going on?"" I said. ""Oh same shit different day, just thought I'd call and see if you were still alive."" Something about what he said made me feel uneasy. ""Yeah um… yeah I'm ok, just taking it day by day,"" I responded. ""You sound tired, are you sure everything is ok?"" He asked. ""Yeah, just a bit annoyed, the power is out and I've been waiting for it to come back on."" He chuckled at that one. ""Don't worry, that happens all the time."" He said. My blood went cold. ""What did you say?"". ""Awe what's the matter, are you scared of the dark?"" His voice was warped. 

I dropped my phone as the sounds of white noise and the familiar screams filled the air. I jumped up and ran up the stairs as the sounds seemed to follow me. I slammed the door and huddled in the corner with my eyes shut tight and my hands covering my ears, I could feel the floor shake as if something monstrous was coming up the stairs. Then after several seconds passed I realized that they were gone. I dared not move, worried that somehow I might once again hear the horrible noises that filled my ears only moments before. Several minutes passed, and I finally managed to stand, still shaken. 

The way things were going, the nightmares, the noises, the whole experience seemed impossible to comprehend in any sane manner. 

I headed down the stairs and into the kitchen, opening the fridge I squinted, and spotted the six-pack on the top shelf in the dark, as I closed the refrigerator door I stopped, something was odd. Opening it I was met with the odor of spoiled meat.  ""What the fu-"" I trailed off. How was it that the contents of the fridge had already gone bad? How long has it been without power? 

Had it been long enough for it to spoil everything? Ultimately I tried to convince myself that it must have been acting up before the power outage. I sighed, practically dragging my feet over to the couch. 

The rain was still coming down heavily, not letting up for an instant. The lightning was still the only source of light, I just stared at nothing. The events of the night were weighing heavily on my mental state, even if it was just my sleep-addled brain causing these things they were nevertheless bothering me. I finished my beer and went to grab another. 

After doing so I suddenly remembered dropping my phone, so I walked over to where I was standing and squinted through the darkness. I felt along the floor for a minute or so to no avail. Upon standing back up I happened to glimpse something on the coffee table. It was my phone. 

I considered calling the electric company again but decided that nothing I could say would make any difference. Not to mention I was paranoid of what I might hear. I went to grab another beer. I felt a bit cooped up so I went to sit on the porch.watching the rain as it poured endlessly. Even though it knocked out the power, I loved thunderstorms, and despite everything, I started to relax a bit. 

Ever so often I'd still get the eerie feeling that I'd once again see the figure in the street, but thankfully I saw nothing save for the torrents of rain and lightning. 

Still staring in the direction of where I'd seen the figure I saw what seemed to be the flickering of a street light.

I stood to my feet. In hope that this may be a sign that the power was being restored, I turned around and stepped into the house to see if they worked. I was immediately met with confusion, I was back in the motel room. I turned to find that the door wouldn't budge. 

I could hear some conversation coming from beyond the wall behind the bedpost. Someone was talking in the next room over. The muffled exchanges sounded like the mundane conversation of two friends. 

As I crept closer the verbal exchanges became strange, gradually morphing into something else entirely.
  
I was slightly able to hear bits and pieces of the conversation, though jumbled together as if they were both speaking at once. Then everything went silent for a moment as I stood still. ""He doesn't think we know he's listening."" They both spoke at once, their voices warped into one inhuman tone. ""And he doesn't know he's coming, very soon."" 

I stood frozen as I heard movement from the other room, I felt sick. The two voices whispered incomprehensibly, both giggling in their warped voices. Then strangely the two voices started humming. Some haunting melody that was made all the more creepy by the inhuman voices. 

I noticed that the humming was moving closer, and soon I heard scratching on the other side of the wall, only a couple of feet away. The voices abruptly stopped… tap….tap...tap. then “why not invite us in?” I then heard scratching again. Only this time it scraped along the wall, moving toward the conjoining door. 

I instinctively scrambled to the closet in the room. I prayed silently that the door to the conjoined room was locked. To my horror, I heard the knob turn slowly. The old door creaked open loudly.  Bare feet were heard slapping against the floor as the creature crept toward the closet door, stopping just feet from it.

I could hear ragged breathing as the thing stood at the door. My blood froze in my veins as I heard the knob slowly turn and the closet door creaked open.

A flash of lightning illuminated the room, and standing just inches from me was so",0,1759506652.0,horror,0,0.33,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around some tables and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. 
If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.

1nx2p0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RelativeAd6727/comments/1nx2p0f/writing_sample/,Writing Sample,"The following excerpt is from one of my roleplays, chronicling the story of a blind Japanese violinist and her romantic interest, a Ukrainian immigrant police officer, set against the backdrop of 1960s Paris.

*Backstage at the Palais Garnier, Artem lingered in the narrow shadow behind the heavy red curtains, his eyes fixed on the stage. Grand gestures and dramatic words were not his way, but his presence was steady, unwavering, even if unnoticed. The audience roared, enraptured by the performance, yet Artem’s attention remained on Yuki. Her fingers danced across the violin strings with a precision that belied her small frame, a power only he seemed to fully grasp. The crowd admired the artist, but Artem admired the woman herself, for simply existing as she was. Even after months away from the spotlight, Yuki commanded every gaze. She had changed so much since that first day, struggling up the theater stairs with her cane, frustration tempered by resolve. That determination had always been there, now honed and undeniable.*

*The memory of that day brought a faint smile to his lips. She had resisted his help at first, independence both shield and necessity. But when she finally allowed it, it had led to a closeness neither had anticipated. Six months into living together, they had settled into a quiet rhythm, one unspoken but deeply understood. Questions from the world, the whispered “Why aren’t you married?” or “What will people think?” slid past them like water on stone. Their understanding required no words; it ran deeper than rumor, deeper than any scrutiny.*

*Tonight mattered to Yuki. After a year away from the stage, she was reclaiming her brilliance, her music shining as brightly as ever. Yet Artem knew her well enough to sense the tension beneath her posture, the subtle hollow in her notes. She was seeking him in the audience, unaware he would not be there. Yet, he had not been idle. A last-minute assignment had placed him on her security detail, a few well-placed words to his superiors ensuring proximity without attention. Rumors of a mysterious man in the theater had already begun circulating. Artem had no intention of fanning gossip; Yuki’s image was too carefully managed. He stayed in the shadows, close enough to watch, to protect, but hidden enough to remain unseen.*

*As the final note of her violin lingered in the air, Artem drew a slow, steady breath. Crowds and clamorous applause were not his element, yet here he was, pulled into the grandeur of the moment by her alone. He watched her bow gracefully, the audience’s cheers rolling over her like waves. Somewhere in the crowd, her mothers were present, their approval unspoken but felt. Yet their presence could not fill the small void she would feel when she did not find him in her line of sight. He could already picture the soft curve of her lips, the searching of her eyes, the silent question of his absence. He would be ready to meet her with quiet truth and steadfast reassurance. He had never left her side, not tonight, not ever.*

*The applause continued as she lingered in her final bow. Artem shifted slightly, staying in the shadows, close enough to see the stage without drawing notice. She was radiant, but he saw the toll of her brilliance — the long nights composing, the self-doubt, the quiet anxieties she rarely voiced. He had been there through it all, the steady hand in her life, caring in the ways he knew: making sure she ate, that she rested, that she never felt alone. Rising early to make her coffee, slipping small treats into her path while she was lost in thought; these were his offerings, silent but enduring.*

*As soon as the concert ended, Yuki made her way backstage, her emotions swirling inside her. She stormed toward her dressing room, her mind racing, knowing her mothers would arrive to meet her in about five minutes. The thought of seeing them eased her tension slightly, but not enough to calm the storm in her heart. Her footsteps were quick and purposeful, but then, something stopped her in her tracks. A familiar scent. It was subtle at first, but unmistakable: the cologne Artem always wore. It filled the space around her, causing her to halt abruptly, her heart skipping a beat.*

*Her breath caught in her throat as she lowered her head, her voice soft but hopeful, “Artem? Is that you?” She couldn’t pinpoint where he was, but that scent — his scent — surrounded her, enveloping the room. She strained her ears, trying to listen for any movement, any sign that he was there. “I don’t know many people who wear Soviet cologne, so you tell me.”, he replied with the slightest smile, his undeniable accent and familiar voice being all the proof she needed to know that it was none other than him. “I’m sorry I wasn’t at the seat you reserved for me, I know those tickets aren’t cheap… But still, I had a very nice view.”*",1,1759506269.0,u_RelativeAd6727,0,1.0,False

The Fellow Opus absolutely sucks! I was one of the suckers that I believe fell into marketing hype.. The reason i personally got it was because a lot of YouTubers recommended it and it had a sleeker less eye sore design for my counter top.. 

  
Oh boy was I wrong.. I've been sucking it up for like a year but now I just can't stand to use it anymore.. I've been buying pre ground coffee and chugging down espresso sludge to avoid using my opus from how much I hate it. I WANT TO THROW IT AWAY SO BAD. Its Cursed. 

  
Issues: 

Insane retention.. you have to basically be an abusive 1950's husband to your opus every morning and smack it.. idk about y'all but I don't want to have to do all that first thing in the morning

Difficult to clean.. as I mentioned the retention problems just clog the whole thing up

Coffee sprays everywhere 

Dials suck and are easy to accidentally push 

Now the burr is stuck probably from how often I take it out to clean it.. so I can't even clean it.

  
I need advice.. see I don't have a huge budget (why i bought the opus in the first place) and I do not want to gamble on some YouTube chilled product that is $500 like I cannot afford that right now.. oh and don't suggest i buy the add on for the opus cause that shit is not going to work I can tell you right now.

Any other ""budget"" grinders y'all recommend? I know you're mostly going to say hand grinders and I guess I'm open to anything that would make my life less miserable every morning.

I read The Discontented Little Baby and liked it a lot, and the approach worked well until my baby hit what is often called the four-month regression at exactly 16 weeks. It happened basically overnight with no change to our routine. We are still out and about during the day but she will no longer nap in the stroller (I have better luck wearing her but it’s still rough) and she’s up every hour at night. Wake up is consistent at 7:30 and dad takes her out to the coffee shop right away. I’ve tried putting her to sleep later but she is so exhausted from little day sleep that I can’t keep her awake much past 8pm. I guess my question is: do I just keep doing what I’ve been doing and hope it gets better? Or should I adjust during this period? I’ll admit that I’ve done a few naps in our slightly darker bedroom just because she seems so upset and tired (they are contact naps and they last between 30 and 40min). I couldn’t find anything in the book or on the website about this period, so I’d appreciate any tips or experiences! ",1,1759506191.0,PossumsSleepProgram,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **""Delaware vs. Western Kentucky: A Hillarious Battle of Brains, Brawn, and Maybe a Few Sacks""**

**The Matchup:**  
The Delaware Blue Hens (-2.5, -142 ML) host the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers (+2.5, +120 ML) in a Conference USA clash. Delaware’s 3-1 record and 2-0 home dominance make them favorites, but their ATS ledger is as shaky as a QB under pressure: 0-1 as a home favorite. Western Kentucky, meanwhile, is 4-1 SU but 0-4 ATS in their last four as underdogs—though they’ve somehow managed to go 4-1 SU by pulling off upsets like defeating Nevada.

**The Numbers:**

* **Money Line Implied Probabilities:** Delaware \~59%, Western Kentucky \~45%.
* **Spread:** Delaware -2.5 (even money at most books).
* **Total:** 61.5 points (Over/Under odds hover around 1.91).
* **Model Magic:** SportsLine’s simulations predict Delaware covers in 69% of runs, but the model’s projected score (54 total points) makes the Over a baffling +62% favorite. Either the Hilltoppers are about to break out, or the model’s coffee intake needs adjustment.

1nx2kr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nx2kr0/does_the_waterdrop_wdd6rf_filter_truly_deliver/,Does the Waterdrop WD-D6RF Filter Truly Deliver? Comprehensive Review Inside!,"The Waterdrop WD-D6RF filter, compatible with the WD-D6-B Tankless Reverse Osmosis System, caught my attention because of its impressive features on paper and its relatively high praise online. I decided to give it a thorough test to see if it lives up to the hype. Having used this replacement water filter for a while, I’ve formed a pretty balanced opinion about its performance, ease of use, and the little quirks you should know before diving in. 

**Ease of Installation and Design**  
The cartridge design of this filter is incredibly user-friendly. With its twist-and-lock mechanism, it takes just a couple of seconds to replace the filter—literally. No tools are needed, and trust me, if you’re someone like me who dreads pulling out the toolbox, this is a blessing. The 14 x 6 x 5-inch dimensions make it compact enough to fit neatly under the sink without crowding the area. 

**Highlights**  
- Twist-and-lock installation in just two seconds.  
- Slim, compact design perfect for tight under-sink spaces.  
- Eco-conscious carbon block made 100% from Sri Lankan coconut shell.  

[View Waterdrop WD-D6RF price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0d2vzj4qn/)

**Filtration Strength and Performance**  
The advanced 6-stage filtration technology here is more than just fancy terminology. With a pore size of 0.0001 microns, this filter is thorough. During my tests, it significantly reduced chlorine, sodium, lead, and an expanse of other contaminants like atrazine and PFAS. The double coconut carbon block layers do a fantastic job of improving water taste and smell, while the layers of PP cotton take care of sediment and rust. I even noticed a difference in coffee—the flavor seemed fresher. My coworker compared two glasses of water from different systems during their visit and instantly guessed which came from this filter setup. 

**Benefits**  
- Multi-layered filtration for cleaner, better-tasting water.  
- Removes contaminants as small as 0.0001 microns.  
- Clear improvement in taste, especially noticeable in beverages like tea and coffee.  

However, if you’re someone with a serious sensitivity to coconut products, you’ll need to keep in mind that the carbon block is derived from coconut shells, which might make this filter less appealing to you.

**Shelf Life and Longevity**  
With a shelf life of 12 months or 1,000 gallons (whichever comes first), this filter offers decent longevity. For someone with average water usage, this is perfectly adequate. However, for a larger household or if water consumption is on the higher side, you might find yourself replacing it before a year is up. That being said, the straightforward replacement process softens this impact.

**Downsides**  
- Shelf life may not be sufficient for heavy water users.  
- Coconut-derived components might not suit everyone.  

**Competitors**  
This filter competes with similar products in the premium water filtration space, including brands like APEC and iSpring. Compared to some of these rivals, the Waterdrop WD-D6RF scores higher in ease of installation and compact design. My neighbor’s system required more effort to change filters, which made me appreciate the simplicity here. However, a competitor like the iSpring offers slightly better filtration stages for higher water usage, which may cater better to a larger family. Still, when it comes to water taste and overall refinement, this filter holds its ground exceptionally well. 

**Smart Spending**  
Is the price justified for what you’re getting? While the initial investment might feel a little steep if you’re on a tight budget, the product’s filtration performance and quality stand out. If you value convenience and clean water with minimal hassle, the cost feels surprisingly fair. Compared to others that might have similar features but come with complicated replacements or pricier cartridges, this one seems like a smart buy for its efficiency.

1nx2kgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyShine/comments/1nx2kgu/can_the_paula_hansen_lip_liner_and_gloss_combo/,Can the Paula Hansen Lip Liner and Gloss Combo Really Last All Day,"Testing out the Peel Off Lip Liner Stain Tattoo was a surprisingly fun and unique experience. I’m someone who cares about how my lips look throughout the day, and I was excited to try the blend of a peel-off lip liner and lip gloss combo being showcased here. The product brings something different to the table with its promise of long-lasting color and a nourishing finish.

**Smooth and Silky Texture**  
Sliding the lip liner across my lips was one of the most satisfying parts of using this product. Its silky texture felt incredibly smooth, almost like brushing on a layer of velvet. I’m used to lip liners that tug at the edges of my lips, but this one not only applied beautifully but also seemed to have a moisturizing effect during the process. The accompanying lip gloss didn’t disappoint either. It had this lightweight feel that didn’t leave my lips sticky, which is an absolute win in my book.

**Long-Lasting and Waterproof Formula**  
One of the standout features was how well the peel-off liner stayed in place. You’d think that a product you peel off might feel gimmicky, but once set, the color lasted all day. I ran it through my unofficial tests like drinking from a coffee cup, taking a walk in the wind, and even having a meal while out with friends—it barely budged. I wasn’t constantly checking my compact mirror, which was such a relief. The waterproof aspect also held up surprisingly well when I accidentally splashed my face with water while washing my hands.

**Special Lip Combo for Versatility**  
This product stood out not just for its formula but for the clever pairing of the brown peel-off lip liner and clear gloss. On its own, the liner gave my lips a defined, natural look, perfect for subtle daily wear. Adding the gloss transformed the style into something more glamorous with a plump, juicy appearance. For quick errands, I’d use just the liner. For night-outs, layering on the gloss made my lips stand out beautifully in photos. The switch between a light and a bold makeup look with one set felt like a handy option I didn’t realize I needed.

**Multi-Usage Effects**  
One of the things I loved playing with was the difference between thin and thick applications. Thinly applying the gloss gave that understated, barely-there glassy feel, while layering it on created a vibrant, fuller lip effect. This versatility added to the fun; it felt like I had multiple products in one compact size. Plus, I appreciated how easy it was to carry around for touch-ups (not that I needed too many).

**Perks**  
- Smooth, velvety application  
- Stays in place despite water or meals  
- Offers versatile makeup options from subtle to glamorous  
- Lightweight, non-sticky gloss formula  
- Nourishing and moisturizing texture  

**Caveats**  
- The peeling-off step might not appeal to everyone.  
- Color range could be expanded for those looking for bolder shades.  
- Packaging design is a little understated and could use some flair.

**Competitive Options**  
Looking at other lip liners and glosses on the market, many fail to combine longevity with comfort. Compared to high-end brands, this product holds its own but at a more accessible price point. Competing products from big names might offer a wider color palette or fancier packaging. However, they often come with issues like drying formulas or needing frequent touch-ups. This set managed to bypass both problems. Drugstore brands might be more budget-friendly but often miss the innovative features like the peel-off aspect or multi-usage. There’s a balance here between high quality and affordability that’s quite rare to find.

**Quality for Price**  
This product felt like an excellent value for what it delivers. While not as extravagant as luxury alternatives, it competes by focusing on functionality and feel. Honestly, the long-lasting formula alone is enough to justify its cost. Add the nourishing gloss into the mix, and it feels like one of those discoveries you rave about to friends. Whether you’re someone testing new styles for fun or need a dependable go-to for busy days, this product fits nicely in both scenarios.

For me, the Ciloa 501 perfectly fills the niche of:

* **Fun Beater Watch:** You can wear it without fear.
* **Solid Design:** The finishing and details far exceed its price point.
* **Value-for-Money:** Great value with zero pretensions.

It seems seems like days where I work I stay up much later at night for whatever reason (probably from drinking a ton of coffee as well as being stimulated from work). On my days off, I typically fall asleep earlier than when I’m working (definitely from drinking beers and doing activities which actually tire me out). For context here we’re in our late 20s.

My girlfriend wants me to stay up later so we can hangout longer which I totally understand. We hung out yesterday all day and typically do on our days off. 

I made a comment while playing a board game we can play 2/3 (implying I was going to win the first game) which set her off because she had that minutes before but I didn’t hear her say it. We normally have really good banter this was just a miscommunication from my perspective that brought out her competitive side.

On days where I’ll work she will sometimes fall asleep hours before me, which I’m 100% okay with as I know the feeling of being tired and wanting to go to bed. I typically wake up later than she does too so it kind of balances out.

Last night around 11;45pm, I started to doze off and she got upset and a little emotional starting to cry a little bit because she wanted to stay up until 1:30pm. I feel horrible and try to stay up later, give it my best efforts but when your body wants to sleep there isn’t much you can do at that point. This has probably happened like 5-6 times of dating throughout a year. 

I feel guilty because she wants to hangout longer and I can’t stay awake, she gets a little emotional sometimes when I’m falling asleep. This is typically between 1030-1130pm at night, never before or later.

Am I the asshole?

I can say more blah blah blah and drag it out with meaningless repetition, like typing random thoughts that nobody cares about just to get to the quota. Words piling up with no added clarity, no better explanation, just noise. I could repeat myself endlessly, circling back to the same frustration about word counts, about fake rules, about making things longer instead of sharper. I could rant about how it feels pointless, how the extra padding adds zero value.

1nx2cs8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nx2cs8,Ciloa 501 “Expreso”: The “Decaf” Watch That Gives You A Jolt (Full Review),"Hey, Guys! I just posted a review of a piece that, despite its simplicity, has me totally hooked: the **Ciloa 501 “Expreso”**.

I’ve nicknamed it the **""decaf"" watch** because, yes, it's the simplified (and much more affordable) version of the model it pays homage to (**Brew Metric Retro Dial**). But trust me, this watch is like that unexpected morning coffee: **simple, reliable, and gives you just the right energy** to start your day. It’s pure fun on the wrist.

In the video, I thoroughly analyze why I believe this Ciloa 501 offers a **killer value proposition**, especially for the enthusiast looking for an everyday automatic without the stress of a **grail watch**. It doesn't have the complexity of high-end Swiss movements, but it definitely has the charm and the **feeling** of a very smart purchase.

For me, the Ciloa 501 perfectly fills the niche of:

* **Fun Beater Watch:** You can wear it without fear.
* **Solid Design:** The finishing and details far exceed its price point.
* **Value-for-Money:** Great value with zero pretensions.

What do you look for in a **budget watch**? Do you prefer a well-executed and fun **homage** like this, or would you always save up for a more expensive original model?

You can watch the **full, honest review** and see how it looks on the wrist here!

1nx2amc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nx2amc/explore_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_bonavita/,Explore the Best Drip Coffee Maker Bonavita Connoisseur BV1901TS,"Testing out the Bonavita BV1901TS coffee maker over the past couple of weeks has been an enlightening experience. I love coffee—probably too much, if I’m being honest—and a reliable machine that combines simplicity with efficiency is what I’m always on the lookout for. The compact size and brushed stainless steel design caught my eye right away, but how does it hold up in daily use? Let’s dig in.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker has a sleek, minimalist aesthetic that fits perfectly on a small kitchen counter, even if you’re tight on space. The stainless steel finish not only looks modern but is also easy to wipe clean, which is a major plus. Its dimensions (16.5"" x 8.1"" x 14.6"") mean it doesn’t dominate your countertop the way bulkier machines do. Like most coffee drinkers, I value not just function but also form, and this one scores well on both. An added detail I appreciated was the thermal carafe, which feels durable and keeps coffee hot for hours.

**Ease of Use**  
Coffee makers can sometimes overcomplicate things, but the Bonavita BV1901TS keeps it refreshingly simple. A single-touch operation is all it takes to brew. If you’re groggy during those first moments of the morning, like me, you're probably not in the mood to wrestle with a dozen confusing buttons. Within six minutes, this machine delivers a piping hot 8-cup brew. The audible signal indicating the brewing is done is an underestimated convenience, especially if you get distracted mid-morning like I often do.

[Check Bonavita BV1901TS price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b076pfmrgx/)  

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
What sets this coffee maker apart is its focus on brewing quality. The built-in 1500-watt heater ensures that water consistently reaches the ideal temperature range (194°F–205°F). For someone who’s picky about taste, that’s a huge deal. The showerhead feature evenly saturates coffee grounds, while the optional pre-infusion mode (or ""blooming"") pre-wets the grounds to unlock all those complex flavors. Using fresh, finely ground beans, I found the resulting cups consistently smooth and rich—on par with my favorite local café! 

**Advantages**  
Here’s what stood out most positively to me about this coffee maker:  
- The thermal carafe retains heat for hours without needing a warming plate, meaning no more burnt-tasting coffee.  
- It’s surprisingly fast—an entire 8-cup carafe in just 6 minutes.  
- Optional pre-infusion mode brings out nuanced flavors, perfect for coffee snobs like me.  
- Dishwasher-safe components like the filter basket and showerhead make cleanup effortless.  

**Limitations**  
No product is flawless, and the Bonavita coffee maker does have some quirks worth mentioning:  
- The carafe lid design makes it slightly tricky to pour the last cup without tilting it steeply.  
- While the one-touch operation is wonderfully simple, it might feel too basic for someone who prefers customizable brewing options.  
- The machine lacks a built-in grinder, so you’ll need pre-ground coffee or a separate grinder for fresh beans.  

**Competing Brands**  
How does it stack up against competitors like the Technivorm Moccamaster or the Breville Precision Brewer? While those models offer more bells and whistles like customizable brew strength and built-in grinders, they’re also priced considerably higher. The Bonavita BV1901TS focuses on nailing the basics—optimal temperature control, even saturation, and speedy brewing—all at a more affordable price point. Plus, its thermal carafe is a win over machines that rely on glass carafes resting on heating plates, which can lead to scorched coffee after an hour or two. For minimalists or budget-conscious coffee lovers, this machine is hard to beat.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Given its consistent brewing quality and ease of use, this coffee maker represents excellent value. While it doesn’t have extensive settings or luxurious add-ons, it more than compensates with reliable performance. Compared to premium alternatives, it delivers nearly café-quality coffee at a significantly lower price tier. The dishwasher-safe components and BPA-free materials also add to its functional value. If you're hunting for a no-frills coffee maker that gets the job done well, this might just be the one.

1nx2ah0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nx2ah0/evaluate_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_breville/,Evaluate the best drip coffee maker Breville Precision Brewer worth it,"**Tested Experience of the Breville BDC400BSS Precision Brewer**  

I've been using the Breville BDC400BSS Precision Brewer daily for a few weeks, and it truly redefines the coffee-drinking experience for any enthusiast or casual coffee drinker. This sleek stainless steel drip coffee maker is not just about brewing coffee; it’s about crafting coffee as an art. The first thing that strikes you is its solid, brushed stainless steel exterior that screams premium quality. Its compact yet functional design sits perfectly on my kitchen countertop without hogging unnecessary space. The inclusion of a glass carafe adds a touch of elegance while being practical for serving multiple cups.  

**Customizable Brewing Options at Your Command**  

The variety of preset brewing modes stole my attention as soon as I started using it. This coffee maker boasts six distinct brewing presets, from Gold Cup to Cold Brew, tailored to meet the needs of every coffee aficionado. Having the “My Brew” option was an added bonus, allowing me to tweak parameters like bloom time, brew temperature, and flow rate. I experimented with everything, from a bold morning cup to a light fruity-flavored coffee in the evening. It’s worth noting how the precise digital temperature control (PID) and Thermo Coil Heating System contribute to maintaining consistent brewing temperatures—a feature that’s hard to find in most other coffee machines.  

[View Breville BDC400BSS Precision Brewer sale info on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b07dmbyh4s/)  

**Strengths**  

• Versatility shines through its six preset modes, satisfying different brewing styles seamlessly.  
• Adjustable brewing parameters, especially with the “My Brew” setting, truly elevate coffee-making to a personal journey.  
• Thermo Coil Heating System ensures cleaner water compared to traditional systems that often use aluminum.  
• Dual filter baskets, both cone and flat-bottom designs, ensure any coffee ground type works perfectly.  
• The patented Steep & Release valve amazed me with its ability to optimize smaller brews when the carafe isn’t positioned.  

**Areas for Improvement**  

• The coffee maker leans on the heavier side, making it less portable for those who frequently move.  
• The complexity of options might feel overwhelming initially to someone who prefers a simple press-and-go design.  
• While it excels at brewing smaller batches, pouring from the carafe can introduce a slight chance of spillage if not done carefully.  

**Design with Performance in Mind**  

The appliance is intuitively designed not just for aesthetics but efficiency. The interface comes equipped with easy-to-understand buttons that make navigating through functionalities straightforward. It isn’t one of those designs that baffle users and require endless manual readings; once I played around for a bit, everything felt intuitive. What’s worth mentioning is the dual-filter basket system included in the packaging. I found it helpful to switch between the flat bottom and cone filters depending on my mood for bold or nuanced flavor profiles.  

**Peer Comparisons with Competitive Products**  

When compared to other respected brands like the Technivorm Moccamaster or the OXO Brew 9-Cup, this product holds its own in versatility and programmability. The Moccamaster excels at keeping coffee hot for longer durations but lacks the advanced temperature controls and multiple brewing profiles found here. The OXO Brew 9-Cup offers precision and convenience but cannot compete with this brewer’s ability to handle cold brews or iced coffee. If customization is important for your brewing rituals, the Breville BDC400BSS Precision Brewer definitely leads in this area. However, those looking for simplicity might lean towards competitors with fewer programmability options.  

**Quality for Price**  

Looking at all the features, the coffee maker delivers exceptional quality for its price bracket. The build quality is robust, and the inclusion of thoughtful components like the pour-over adapter compatibility justifies its cost. Is it an investment? Yes. Is it a worthwhile one for coffee lovers who want premium results without depending on overpriced café options? Absolutely. Its versatility, in particular, is rare at the price point, and the results it delivers are every bit as professional as advertised.

He built our house himself. Woke up at 5AM every day of my childhood. Never cried. Never talked about feelings. He wasn’t cruel, just distant. The kind of dad who showed love by checking your tire pressure or fixing a loose step, not by saying anything out loud. (Watch [husband Feminization stories](https://www.youtube.com/@crossdressing-story) here)

I grew up thinking there was no room in our house for softness.

Especially not *this* kind of softness.

I kept it hidden my whole life. I’d try on things when no one was home — tights, slips, a lipstick I bought at a corner store and kept in a ziplock under my mattress. I told myself it was just stress, just a phase, just curiosity.

But the truth was… I felt like *me* in those moments. Like everything I repressed finally had air.

Then my mom passed.

It was sudden. A stroke. I moved back in to help my dad — not because he asked, but because I didn’t know what else to do. We were strangers in a house full of silence and old furniture. We barely spoke unless it was about groceries or bills.

One night, maybe two months in, I couldn’t hold it anymore. The grief, the loneliness, the buried part of myself. I waited until he went to bed. Then I went into Mom’s old closet.

I picked a long navy dress with little flower patterns. It was soft. Old. Still smelled like her lavender dryer sheets. I put it on. Then a light touch of lipstick. Just enough to feel that echo of something I didn’t have a name for.

And I just… stood there in the hallway. Breathing.

Then I heard a floorboard creak.

I turned and saw him — my father — standing at the edge of the dark kitchen.

He didn’t say anything.

I braced for it. The look. The disgust. The rejection.

But he just nodded.

One slow, quiet nod.

Then he said, “That was her favorite dress.”

I couldn’t speak. I just started crying — full body, shaking, the kind of cry you don’t come back from the same.

He walked past me into the kitchen, opened a cabinet, poured two glasses of water. Then handed one to me.

We sat in silence at the table.

He didn’t ask questions. He didn’t need to.

After a while, he looked at me and said, “You look like someone who’s tired of pretending.”

I nodded.

Then he said, “We’ve got enough sadness in this house. You don’t need to add yourself to the list.”

I don’t remember what I said after that. I just remember that I didn’t feel ashamed anymore.

And I haven’t worn that dress since — not because I’m hiding, but because it’s folded now. In a box he helped me pack. My own clothes. My own style.

Mine.

And he still makes coffee every morning. Still doesn’t talk much.

But when he refills my cup, he smiles now.

Like maybe, just maybe, he sees me.",1,1759505141.0,Feminizationstories09,0,1.0,False
1nx26wk,https://v.redd.it/try8q8o4zwsf1,Solo dev shipped a free Steam demo (arcade racer) — “100 wishlists = two coffees” — advice on turning ‘adds’ into actual players?,"Hey solo folks! I’m a one-person dev who finally shipped a free Steam demo of my low-poly arcade racer, *Virtuoso GP Race-On*. I focused on feel over looks: bespoke physics, EXTEND TIME checkpoints, instant restarts, global leaderboards (no ghosts), and a new Analog steering option. FPS: 30 / 60 / unlocked.

Why I’m posting (and what I learned):

* Build → Sell → Ship (…anxiety edition). I can code features all day, but pressing “Post” takes two. Last time I shared the store page, people argued about 30fps. This time: demo’s live, with framerate options and analog steering.
* Numbers (first days): \~391 free licenses, 12 unique players, 80 wishlists (+20 after demo). Either Steam’s stats lag… or I’ve built a very comfy funnel where people click “Add to library” and never launch. 😅
* What I tightened already: default build + launch options OK; installs clean from a non-dev account; toned down skid SFX; lowered music default; tuned checkpoint timers on the first track (Sakura) so you can go almost flat-out with one real brake.

Questions for the hive mind:

1. Any solo-friendly tricks to convert “add to library” → launch? (Shorter first boot? Smaller download? On-store copy like “Download \~XXX MB / 1-click to race”?)
2. Best place for an in-game wishlist CTA that isn’t annoying? (Exit screen? after first PB?)
3. Posting cadence that won’t fry an AUDHD brain? I can't do one short clip/day + two replies,  long campaigns melt me.
4. Steering: I emulate a cabinet with a ramp-to-full-lock, but added Analog for pads. Any pitfalls to avoid (deadzones, curves) you’ve found?

Stack / scope:  
Unity + [Steamworks.NET](http://Steamworks.NET); custom vehicle physics; 2 tracks (Sakura Coast & Giza); 1 car; global leaderboards; instant restarts. Very small demo scope to actually finish something.

If this reads like procrastination disguised as productivity… it absolutely is. Thanks for any pointers—if I hit 100 wishlists, that’s two coffees in the fancy part of town (not counting the Steam fee).",1,1759505139.0,SoloDevelopment,0,1.0,False

Does not work for apocha. Been there, done that.They don't come. Because they don't know.

I have been working in the software industry for 25 years, both as an employee and as a freelancer. During that time, I have held almost every job title at least once, from junior developer to cloud architect to CTO.

Now I am a solo founder.

* Backend: my home turf
* Frontend: not really
* Marketing: what's that?

IMHO\* apocha is one of the best money management software available. Let's start marketing\*\*.

\* biased  
\*\* I have no clue how to do that.

Some years ago I've tried several money manager and budgeting apps, Excel spreadsheets, and so-called expense trackers. For me, the effort to enter data as detailed as I wanted was always far too high. They often look nice and are easy to use on the surface.

But things get complicated when you need to enter a large grocery haul, for example. I don't want to just write down ""Supermarket, $220.70"" or ""Groceries, $220.70"".

The idea was born: automatically analyze a photo of a receipt with software. After a lot of trial and error, tinkering, and programming, it worked quite well and was perfect for my needs.

**Current status**: The app started as a side project and has been released for 2.5 years while I was having contract work more than full-time. Almost no additional work went into the app. Nevertheless it grew to \~150 paying customers (CAC $0, ARPU $3.5, CLTV $100, MRR $500). With these numbers, I decided in to go all. I finished my last freelance project in June and released a completely redesigned version last month.  Now I want to bring apocha to at least $5000 MRR within a year.

**The challange:** apocha is invisible today: a simple website, no followers on any social media platform, no one talks about apocha on the internet. I need to change that now.

**What I offer**: I offer the expense tracker app apocha. Compared to other expense tracker apps apocha has several advantages:

**Support of multiple currencies** with calculation of the conversion rate. This is important e.g. if one is on vacation and pays in local currency A with your credit card which gets debited in currency B. In order to have the receipts with the expenses in currency A in sync with your bank statements in currency B and expense tracker app must be able to do the calculations.

**Detailed automatic categorization**: apocha automatically categorizes all receipt and invoice line items into one of 5000 hierarchical categories. See https://apocha.info/. So T-Shirts go into the category ""Apparel & Accessories > Clothing > Shirts & Tops > Shirts"" instead of just ""Shopping"" as used by many other expense trackers. This enables analysis at all aggregation levels.

**Matrix like settings**: In addition, users can define tags as a filter vertical to the item categories. In other expense trackers you can put only one category on one entry, e.g. being on vacation and going to a restaurant can either have the category Restaurant or Vacation. So the users can only see how much they spent on vacations or on dining out. With apocha, the items on the receipt of the restaurant get categories like Restaurant > Beer or Restaurant > Salad. In addition, the users can add a tag ""Vacation"" to the receipt. This opens the possibility of very detailed financial analysis because now the users can see how much the spent on e.g. beer in restaurants during their vacation.

**Import receipts and invoices by email**: The users can send digital invoices by email to their apocha account. Event better, they can automate that for receipts and invoices the receive by email. They can create forwarding rules so that these receipts and invoices are forwarded to their apocha account automatically. (see https://apocha.info/docs/guides/import-receipts-by-email/settings/send-receipts-by-email-settings/)

**Recurring transactions**: With apocha it is very easy to create and manage recurring transactions with different billing intervals such as rent, subscriptions, insurances, and so on.

**Spending pattern detection**: In case you forgot some subscriptions the spending pattern detection widget will find it for you, just like your daily coffee to go or the weekly lottery ticket you've never won with.

**Full text search and advanced filtering**: apocha offers a Google-like full-text search for all your receipts. Search, filter, and drill down into every transaction. This enables you to find everything, e.g.: How much did that nice-smelling soap cost and where did I buy it? And what was the name of that restaurant where I had that delicious monkfish 2 years ago?

**ICS calendar export**: apocha offers the creation of multiple calendar profiles, each with multiple reminder rules. That way it is e.g. possible to export a calendar ICS file for all receipts, invoices, or transactions of the coming 12 months with a minimum total of $1000 filtered by bank account and keywords. The calendar can then have multiple reminders, e.g. a reminder 2 days ahead for transactions up to $2000 and 5 and 3 days ahead for all transactions over $2000. It's also possible to set alarms after the transaction date. This is convenient e.g. for reminders the a free test period or a warranty is about to expire. These calendars can be imported into the users' calendar app via the apocha API.(see https://apocha.info/docs/guides/settings/calendar/)

**Multiple highly configurable widget based dashboards**: The users can create multiple individual and personalized dashboards. Each dashboard can contain multiple widgets such as asset overview, savings rate, net worth development, recurring transactions, income vs expenses, expenses by category etc. Each widget can be configured by a lot of settings and filters, e.g. date interval, parent category, keyword filter and so on.

**Hierarchical financial accounts**: With apocha the users can create a hierarchy of financial accounts of types like cash, bank accounts, crypto currencies, real estate, credit cards, valuables, precious metals, consumer loans, mortgages and so on. With such a hierarchy of accounts the users can model their real accounts or can use virtual accounts to create a budgeting system, e.g. envelope budgeting with 4 accounts for the weeks of a month, accounts for spending categories, sinking funds to save for the next gadget and so on.

**apocha is a browser based Progressive Web App**: Running in the browser, no downloads, always the newest version, data sync between all devices, share your account with you partner or family members. Snap on iPhone at the store, analyze on your MacBook at home, and review with your partner on Android.

**Excel download:** You can download all your data as an Excel file for further analyses. In that case please tell me what you do in Excel so that I can put it on apocha's **list for voting on the next features to be implemented**.

**REST API (coming soon):** Access all your data via a well-defined REST API or even develop your own app for that.

I'd love your feedback! As a software engineer, I made the classic mistake of building first and marketing never. I'm changing that now.

1nx23xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WebApps/comments/1nx23xw/travel_planning_is_broken_im_building_an_ai_to/,Travel planning is broken. I’m building an AI to reinvent it.,"# Hey reddit fam,

I'm Kunal, and I've always been fascinated by a paradox in travel. We travel to feel present, to discover, and to experience new things. Yet, so much of our precious vacation time—both before and during the trip—is spent staring at our phones, figuring out where to go next or if a place is even worth visiting.

The experience of travel itself is often fragmented by the constant mental load of planning.

I believe we can change that. I'm building **Travique** to create a more seamless, intelligent, and enriching travel experience from end to end.

Our vision is simple: **Experience more, plan less.**

**Travique** is an AI-native platform that acts as your personal travel intelligence. Instead of you doing all the work, our platform learns your unique style and builds a complete, bespoke journey from the ground up. We're focused on delivering a fundamentally better travel experience through four key pillars:

**🧠 Deep Personalization:** The AI creates a truly logical, day-by-day itinerary with an interactive map that is 100% tailored to you.

**💎 Uncovering Hidden Gems:** We have a dedicated AI that scours data to find authentic local restaurants, secret photo spots, and unique experiences that most guidebooks miss, weaving them directly into your plan.

**✨ A Seamless Experience:** The entire journey, from the initial idea to the final plan, lives in one beautiful, clean interface.

**🗣️ The Future is Conversational:** On our near-term roadmap is an integrated AI chatbot. Soon, you'll be able to modify your plan with simple commands like ""make tomorrow more relaxed"" or ""find me a good coffee shop near the museum.""

We're in the final stages of polishing the platform before our official launch, and the feedback from this community of builders and early adopters would be absolute gold. We've just opened up our waitlist for those who want to be the first to try it.

**You can check out our landing page and join the waitlist here:**

**You can also view sample travel plan generated by our platform here, to see what all it can do -**

I'm here all day to answer any questions and would be incredibly grateful for your thoughts.

My questions for you are:

1. What's your single biggest frustration with the current way you plan trips?
2. We're thinking of a ""pay-per-trip"" model (unlock a full itinerary for a one-time fee) instead of a recurring subscription. Does that resonate with you?
3. Looking at our landing page, does our value proposition come across clearly?
4. What's one ""killer feature"" you wish your dream travel planner had?

Thanks for your time and insight!

Cheers,

1nx23t1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nx23t1/could_replacement_pitcher_water_filters_from/,Could Replacement Pitcher Water Filters from Joogto Improve Water Quality? In-Depth Review,"The Joogto Filter Replacement for LS Home water filter pitchers and dispensers came into my life at a time when I was seriously considering investing in bottled water due to persistent issues with taste and clarity in my filtered water. With its impressive claim to remove over 30 contaminants, including microplastics and PFAS, I decided to give it a shot. It’s safe to say, I was intrigued—and a little skeptical.

**Exceptional Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed when unboxing this filter was its compact and lightweight build. Weighing just 6.7 ounces, it doesn’t feel bulky or cheap despite its lightness. The materials, a blend of carbon, coconut shell, and plastic, are food-grade, lead-free, and BPA-free, which gave me peace of mind about the safety of the water I’d be drinking. The unique use of 100% Sri Lankan coconut shell carbon is not something I’d seen before, and it adds an eco-friendly touch that aligns with reducing single-use plastics. The fit with my LS Home Glass Pitcher 7 Cup was snug and seamless, with zero hassle during installation.

**Verified Performance**  
Having read that these filters are tested by independent labs and remove 97.9% of chlorine, I had high expectations. True to its word, the metallic undertone of my tap water disappeared almost immediately, leaving it odorless and refreshing. A surprising bonus: my morning coffee started tasting significantly better without hints of strange aftertastes. The membrane microfilter and activated carbon exchange system really do their job, enhancing both the taste and aroma of drinking water. 

**Pluses**  
- Exceptional purification from coconut shell carbon.  
- Versatile across multiple pitcher models like LS Home Glass Pitcher 7 Cup and Dispenser 18 Cup.  
- Improves the taste and clarity of water noticeably.  

[Check Joogto Filter Replacement price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0c5c1v5jd/)  

**Durability and Longevity**  
What stood out for me is the lifespan of these filters. The microfilter can handle up to 1,000 liters per year, while the activated carbon portion lasts up to two months or 150 liters. With daily usage filling about three to four pitchers full, I found this claim accurate. It’s a huge relief not having to replace filters constantly.

**Ease of Use and Compatibility**  
Installing the filter took less than a minute. It snapped securely into my pitcher without excessive fiddling or frustration. This product accommodates a variety of options, including the LS Home 18 Cup Dispenser and 10 Cup Plastic Pitcher. It’s reassuring to know I can swap between pitchers or dispensers seamlessly if I upgrade or downgrade models later. However, I do wish the packaging included a comprehensive installation guide for first-timers.

**Drawbacks**  
- Packaging could be more user-friendly for new users.  
- Initial water flow-through was slightly slower compared to older filters, though it improved with use.  

**Industry Competitors**  
Having tested other pitcher filters like Brita and PUR, it’s worth noting where Joogto excels and falls short. In terms of chlorine and contaminant removal, it’s neck and neck with the leading brands. The eco-friendly carbon feature might tip the scale for those aiming to reduce their carbon footprint. However, Brita filters tend to have a more widely available replacement system, making them easier to grab in a pinch. PUR’s rapid flow design also slightly edges out Joogto when speed is a top priority. Still, Joogto's focus on broad compatibility and longevity makes it a strong contender in its category.

**Money's Worth**  
From an affordability standpoint, this filter wins. The durability ensures fewer replacements, and its filtration quality means I’ve saved a significant chunk previously spent on bottled water. Sure, similar filters might seem cheaper initially, but hidden costs add up when you need replacements more frequently. This product more than justifies its price.

You get free stuff often. Women are direct about your attractiveness instead of subtle. These men are unicorns and rare to find.

A Tier - very attractive - you get approached every time you go out once or twice a night at a bar or a club type setting, may get approached during daytime setting every now and then but not common. Women may initiate physical touch. Probably 1%-2% of men are in this category.

B Tier - Attractive/ above average - you get approached by strangers once around maybe every 3 or 4 times of the time you go out. Will be easy to have a successful dating life. You don’t stop a room. Women will give you subtle signs to approach much moreso than them approaching you outright. Top 10-20%

C Tier - Average, you get cold approached by women once in a blue moon, if at all, but you aren’t bad looking and still can find success dating.

D tier - Below average/unattractive - you have never been approached, but you still have a chance with dating but it will be harder. Bottom 10%

Tier 1 places are my all-time favorites, Tier 2 shops are also very very good and are in my regular rotation. Most of the shops in Tier 3 I find aren't as good, OR are good, but not my personal preference (like florin having a more fruity profile), but okay enough that I will still go out of convenience. Tier 4 cafes, I personally wouldn't really go there as the coffee is not great. Tier 5, I would avoid as the coffee is NOT good. These are just my personal opinions though, but hopefully this is a helpful reference for anyone looking to try some good coffee/matcha in the city!

But seriously, this is just a drop in the ocean for what is yet to come. Bitcoin and ETH have also already responded well with them being up around 6% and 10% respectively...yet again this is only a drop in the ocean for what is yet to come.

October is always a good month for crypto and you can probs make money investing in majority of things rn, but you will make the most money by investing in projects that will perform well whether its October or not. Now is the time to get in though, up 70% already and things are just gonna heat up more and more and more, imo and this is NFA Kendu will not be below 100 million market cap by the end of this month. I couldn't tell you how high we will go because it's impossible and would just be a guess. Things move very very quickly in crypto and you are about to find out if you are brand new. For example Shib 1000x in 36 days, going from 22 million to 22 billion market cap. You could have literally turned $1000 into $1,000,000 in just over a month...

Kendu rn is arguably the best small cap to invest in, a lot of signs point to in terms of 2021 price action, Kendu being the next Shiba Inu or the next Doge. From Kendu being number 1 on Capitoday, to Kendu having the strongest Reddit and Stocktwits presence with a very strong X presence, Kendu is really setting new levels to what a community can achieve. We are doing all of this whilst also revolutionising the way memecoins will build in the future with an insane catalogue of IRL efforts.

Here is the list of them:

* Kendu Energy

* Kendu Coffee

* Kendu Merch

* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida

* Kendu animation 

* Kendu Board Game

* Kendu Creator

* Kendu Jewellery

* Kendu Beer

* Kendu Video Games

* Tattoos 

* Murals

* Kendu Entertainment

* KenduSTREET

* Kendu Vapes

* Kendu Plushies

* Kendu Vendu

* Kendu Press 

* Kendu Hand Cream

* Kendu Discs

* Kendu Sneakers

* Kendu Spice

* Kendu Radio Show

* Kendu Unleashed

This is absolutely insane, all done from the average community member too. All of this below 20 million market cap, Kendu is genuinely unmatched and this **Proof of Humanity** will carry a lot of weight once retail comes.

My husband and I just booked a 5-night all-inclusive stay at Hilton Tulum Riviera Maya in December 2025, and I’d love to get some recommendations from anyone who’s been recently — especially on restaurants, beaches, cenotes, and things to do on free days. First time at an inclusive resort so every piece of advice helps. 

Here’s our rough itinerary so far:

🌞 Excursions Booked:
• Day 2: Tulum Ruins, Sea Turtles & Cenote Swim Adventure (early start, 6 AM)
• Day 4: ATV, Zipline & Cenote at Extreme Adventuring with Tulum Adventures (1:30 PM start)

🗓️ Free Days:
• Day 1: Arrival afternoon — probably just want to relax at the resort or walk the beach.
• Day 3: Open.
• Day 5: Open.

What we’re into:
• Beaches with clear water and minimal crowds
• Cenotes that aren’t overly commercial
• Authentic local food (especially tacos, seafood, and good coffee)
• Cool photo spots / jungle vibes
• A nice mix of relaxation and adventure

Questions:
• What are some good restaurants that are a must go to in the resort or near Tulum? 
• Are there any hidden gems or must-see spots you’d suggest on our free days?
• Best transportation options to get around outside the resort?

100% emotional guarantee. No refunds. (AUDHD developer version)","**1)** What does 100 wishlists mean?  
An empire. And by “empire” I mean two coffees in the fancy part of town. ☕️☕️  
(As long as you don’t count the $$$ Steam charges to let you upload the game.)

**2)** INDIE 10X™ Method: Build • Sell • Ship on time.  
AUDHD translation: Build • Sell (think about it without leaving the room) • Procrastinate with style.

**3)** BUILD  
– Design 50 features.  
– Cut to 2.  
– Result: 4 half-finished features. Success. ✅

**4)** SELL (without leaving your room)  
Close the door. Lower the blinds. Repeat: “I’m a shark.”  
Open socials.  
Forget the plan and watch cat videos.  
Refocus and type: “Free demo • Wishlist.”  
Hover over Post.  
Close socials. Open and close them a few times to make sure you didn’t post by accident.  
Spend 48 hours with anxiety.  
Repeat.

**5)** CALENDAR  
T-10: “Today I post.”  
T-9: Deep research (watch 23 other people’s trailers).  
T-8: Logo redesign.  
T-7: Redo the HUD.  
T-6: “Tomorrow for sure.”  
T-1: Post at 03:12. Zero likes.

**6)** Premium branding (MBA edition):  
Call the polygons “handcrafted”, the physics “bespoke”, and nostalgia “curated.”  
Guru translation: slap EXTEND TIME on screen in 120pt and blast through a checkpoint.  
If someone asks about FPS: “Now with 100% more frames—30/60/Unlocked.” Boom. Confetti.

**7)** Copy that converts (because it says so):  
“Not just retro-looking, it DRIVES like back then.”  
Say it in ad voice with a serious face. Adds +0.0004 WL every time.

**8)** Anatomy of the perfect post:  
– 10s video (drift → clock at 00:01 → “Play the demo”).  
– Epic one-liner.  
– No link in the text.  
– Think about putting the link in the first comment.  
– Don’t.  
– 24h anxiety.  
– Post the link the next day. Too late. The post is dead. It’s fine—no one saw it anyway.

**9)** Creator outreach:  
Subject: “FREE DEMO (no key)”.  
Body: 3 lines.  
Attachment: 700MB of screenshots in a zip called final\_final\_NOW\_really.zip.  
Close the email before sending.  
Anxiety +24h.  
Send.  
Glorious silence. (*You’re selling.*)

Day 1: +3 WL (your alt and two bots).

Day 3: +17 WL (someone said “Sega vibe”).  
…  
Day 185: you hit 100 WL thanks to bots.  
Celebrate with one coffee (paid with hope).

**11)** Secret metric of success:  
Did you press Post even once? You won.  
Did you think about it for two days and not post?  
Welcome to the Mindfulness Marketing Club.

**12)** Shameless CTA: Free demo (can’t get cheaper):

1nx1w4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1nx1w4o/smoking_husband/,Smoking Husband,"My husband has been smoking cigarettes since he was a young teen. It never really bothered me. Sometimes his breath was not great but that was also cuz of coffee addiction as well. Now that we have a baby I really want him to quit smoking. I know I can't force him but I'm just so frustrated. Let me be clear that he never smokes around the baby when he smokes. He is outside in a full jumpsuit and hat and when he comes inside all of those clothes go into a box near the door and then he washes his hands, face, and uses mouthwash. He used to smoke in his car but since we had the baby he stopped and we paid around $400 to get it deep cleaned with steam cleaning and ozone. It's not perfect but it is genuinely the best we can do until we can actually afford a new car. But even so all of this is not enough. I really want him to quit smoking. I don't care about him smoking weed. It's just cigarettes. I want him to quit. I wish he would even just switch to vaping at this point. I know that still has third hand smoke too, but I'm just like I said I'm so frustrated. Around 12 years ago he tried patches, lozenges and Chantix. None of them worked. He said that the patches and lozenges made him too nauseous and chantix gave him very vivid nightmares. He even got hypnotized which actually worked but then he pushed through it because he didn't like the idea of something telling him not to smoke that wasn't coming from him. I guess I don't really know.
He suffers from complex PTSD from childhood abuse as well as from being in the army and fighting in Iraq. Since baby has been born he said it around 3 months and around 6 months that he wanted to quit but has taken no actual steps. He won't schedule an appointment with his doctor. Won't schedule appointment with his therapist. Won't try anything. 
I'm at my wit's end. I can't force him to quit but I just I need hope that he'll quit. I don't know. He said he would be open to try cytisine so we ordered some online. We'll see. I don't know if he'll even actually try it or he'll try it enough to tell me it's not working. 
Does anybody have any words of encouragement or can share a similar situation? I just feel alone and upset. We had a big fight about it again this morning. Our baby is only 7 months and I don't want her to associate smoking with my husband. ",2,1759504466.0,Mommit,10,1.0,False

He is very particular and things usually have to be his way.  I’ve never been in a relationship where someone makes me cry so much and I’m starting to feel like I’m crazy and maybe it’s just me.  But the things he says and does are so hurtful and when I bring it up he says I’m not thinking of his feelings and it’s not fair.  

For example, he is not a morning person but I am.  I usually try to wait and talk to him in the morning until he’s been up a while and gone to his office.  He likes to have his coffee first.  The other morning I came down after he had been up for almost an hour and didn’t realize he hadn’t had his coffee yet.  I asked him if he could help me with something later that day and he said he would need to check his schedule and he needed to have his coffee before we talked about it further.  I went upstairs and came back down and he started the conversation again so I thought we were good.  I said a few more comments about the task I needed help with and he got very irritated and said “I told you I needed to have my coffee first”.  

I got upset and started to cry because it felt like he was irritated at me for asking him for help and I went upstairs.  He texted me like 30 min later saying his schedule was free and he could help me.  When I spoke with him about my feelings, he said it was unfair for me to get upset when he gets irritated.  That I didn’t respect his wishes to talk about it after his coffee.  He said he should be able to get irritated at me and it not upset me because his feelings were valid and me getting upset made it seem like his feelings were disregarded.  His irritation was that I kept talking to him when he needed coffee first not about the task.  He did apologize for starting the convo back up and confusing me because he said he didn’t realize he did that.  I guess I just don’t understand this and wanted some other people to weigh in.

I wanted to share my experience with something that's become an absolute game-changer for my outdoor adventures - a portable mug warmer. If you're like me and can't start your day without a hot cup of coffee, especially during those chilly morning camping trips, you're going to love this.

I recently discovered this amazing mug warmer (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) that's completely transformed my camping experience. Let me tell you why it's worth every penny.

First off, it's super compact and lightweight. I can easily slip it into my backpack without taking up much space. The best part? It works with any flat-bottomed mug or cup, so you don't need to buy special containers.

Here's how I use mine:
- Set it up on any flat surface at your campsite
- Place your mug on top
- Press the simple on/off button
- Enjoy hot drinks for hours!

The temperature control is what really impressed me. Unlike those basic warmers that just heat everything to blazing hot, this one maintains your drink at the perfect temperature. No more burnt tongue or lukewarm disappointment!

Battery life is another huge plus. On a full charge, it keeps going for about 4-5 hours, which is perfect for those long morning sessions watching the sunrise or evening stargazing with hot cocoa.

What really sets this particular warmer (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) apart is its durability. I've accidentally dropped mine a couple times, and it's still working perfectly. The waterproof design means morning dew or light rain won't cause any issues.

Some pro tips I've learned:
- Bring a power bank for extended trips
- Clean the surface after each use to prevent sticking
- Use mugs with flat bottoms for best results
- Keep it in a zip-lock bag when not in use to protect from dust

Safety-wise, it has an auto-shutoff feature that kicks in after 4 hours, so you don't have to worry if you forget to turn it off. The non-slip base is also great for uneven surfaces at campsites.

The energy efficiency is remarkable. It uses minimal power while keeping your drinks at the perfect temperature, which means it won't drain your portable power bank too quickly.

I've used mine on numerous camping trips now, from quick overnight stays to week-long adventures. Whether it's coffee, tea, hot chocolate, or even soup, it's never let me down. It's become as essential as my sleeping bag or flashlight.

For anyone who loves camping but hates cold drinks, this is definitely worth checking out. Trust me, once you try it, you'll wonder how you ever camped without one!

Let me know if you have any questions about using a mug warmer for camping. I'm always happy to share more tips and tricks!",1,1759504075.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

My breakfast consists of 4 eggs, two pieces of whole wheat toast, two hash browns, coffee w/ cream, handful of cherry tomatoes/or half an avocado based on mood, couple tbsps. smart balance butter, usually falls around 900-1100 calories. This is the breakfast that works for me to help me get decent protein and feel sated until dinner. 

I feel like I'm overeating. It's a lot of food. And after I eat it I feel bloated.

Around the noon/2pm time is when I feel hungry and have to push myself to not eat until dinner. Dinner is different from night to night - it's not always the best nutrient diverse meal - it's often a mix of protein and carbs, but I stay under the 1100 calorie size, even then it feels like I'm over-eating.

That’s a *big deal*, because RTINGS doesn’t hand out perfect scores like candy. Most good ANC earbuds hover around the 8–9 range, and even top over-ear headphones like Sony’s XM6s or Bose QC Ultra Headphones don’t hit a clean 10.

What makes this crazy is that Apple managed to nail cancellation across the whole frequency range. Usually ANC is really good with low rumbles (like airplane engines) but weaker with mid/high noises (voices, clinks, random background stuff). The Pro 3s somehow cover it all—so whether you’re on a plane, in a coffee shop, or walking down a noisy street, they block it out better than anything else tested.

**Bottom line:** the AirPods Pro 3 just set the new gold standard for ANC. If noise cancelling is your top priority, nothing else out there right now measures up.",27,1759503941.0,headphones,27,0.74,False

1nx1mcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1nx1mcj/you_should_get_fined_for_being_bad_at_your_job/,YOU should get fined for being bad at your job.,"I'm sick of NBA fans saying that the refs should get fined for making bad calls. This may sound logical because NBA players get fined all the time but it is not. NBA players get fined for things like violating league rules through actions like criticizing officials, excessive technical or flagrant fouls, resting healthy players, and off-court misconduct. Notice that they do not get fined as a performance review.

If Ben Simmons got fined for losing a playoff series to the Hawks, that would be outrageous. Being bad at his job impacts his future prospects and his next contract. That is how he is punished for bad performance.

You may argue that NBA refs are not held accountable given that bad refs are still allowed to ref and that is fair. But if you think fining the refs is the solution to this, you've lost the plot. Therefore if you believe this, you should get fined for messing up at your job. Too long of a bathroom break? $100. Spilled coffee? $20.

Edit: I should have clarified that refs should obviously be demoted for poor performance but not fined.",0,1759503858.0,nba,61,0.4,False

Did I run afoul of the great click counting & timing lords in the land of Microsoft?  
Am I being denied the promised manna and, mead, and milk called the card discount?  
What do I need to sacrifice to the overbearing lords upon high to resume my earing and redeeming, a small farm animal? A domestic pet? Perhaps a virgin? Or shall it require my own sacred blood be spilt upon thy alter of benevolence Master Gates?  
No, no, I see the light through the clouds now, once the reins are removed, I shall cash out, bolt from these withering pastures, and never look back upon this damned land that once ran with gold and manna, blue skies, and clear water, for it is cursed, corrupt evil, and poisoned beyond my peasant understanding.  
I shall leave for the greener Arcadian pastures, be it Google, Yahoo, even Yandex, I shall find brethren like me to rejoice in the fall of the corrupt and sanctimonious AI overlords of the land of Microsoft and watch as their once mighty temples burn and fall into disarray, becoming a forgotten corner, no longer relevant in this world.

1nx1k43,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nx1k43/aitah_for_only_choosing_only_food_for_my_birthday/,AITAH for only choosing only food for my birthday menu that I know my friend won’t like?,"I, 24f, am turning 25 soon and want to host a birthday café-like party at my place. I kinda stopped celebrating my birthday for 4 years because I don’t really like throwing parties and only started celebrating again last year, so I thought a chill Sunday morning with coffee and some food would be lovely.


Over the last 1-2 years I started noticing problems in one of my friend groups. It got to a point where out of the 5 of us, me and another friend (26f) were always left out. They didn’t invite us for a surprise day trip for one of them, completely ignored the fact that I graduated from college until the other friend organized a little surprise for me and overall frequently proved that they are not there for me if I really need them. 


I always knew the three others are closer among themselves because they’ve known each other ever since they were toddlers. But me and the other friend joined the group over 10 years ago as well.


In any case, I’m currently working on my birthday café menu and I noticed that one of the three others (25f) probably won’t like a single thing there. I‘m planning on having 3 different cakes and 2 savory snacks, most very inoffensive and normal (focaccia, sandwiches, different dips, chai cake, almond cake etc.) but 25f is a very picky eater. I also didn’t choose any of this just to spite her, I actively chose things that I know I would like, since I’m a people pleaser who wants to change her ways.


The other day said friend 25f sent me a recipe for a birthday cake and wrote “can you make this for your birthday and invite me?” Which truly stunned me. She was always the type of person to use my people pleasing tendencies for her advantage but I just now started seeing those. I only replied that I’m still workshopping my menu.


But this really made me realize that she might not find anything she likes. A part of me wants to make something else just for her, but the other part is telling me to absolutely not do that because everything has been revolving around her forever and I’m tried of it. My boyfriend 26m is telling me not to invite them at all, but that’s also not that easy. Even though they hate any kind of birthday that doesn’t involve getting drunk and won’t have fun anyway, we are still a friend group and breaking it up after over 10 years feels unnecessarily difficult. Once I move I will probably never hear from them ever again anyway.

	•	A 20-foot DIY bridge over a seasonal brook

	•	A small hillside deck built on unstable fill ground



I’m not a pro carpenter, just a long-time landscaper who needed better access (and a place to sit with coffee 😅). The video below isn’t a tutorial — just a real-world build showing how I figured it out, adjusted, and made it work.

I’ve been climbing for a few years now, and I always struggled to find a good pre-workout for longer sessions. Most of what’s out there is made for bodybuilding, super high caffeine, artificial stuff, and it never felt right for climbing.

That led me to experiment with making my own. With the help of a nutritionist friend, we put together a mix that’s only organic fruits and veggies for performance, plus natural caffeine from yerba mate and green coffee beans. My friends and I have been using it before climbs and noticed we can go for longer sessions, feel more steady energy, and don’t get that crash you usually get from heavy stimulants.

Long post ahead, my apology in advance.

To put it simply, me and my bestie have been friends for over 7 years, very close friends for 4.

We first knew each other on the internet and after we went to collage in a same city, we bonded deeper. Despite our differences and up-down moments, our friendship was tight and she is the kind of friend where I can see myself help raising her future children as the typical ""alcoholic uncle"" lol. We went through everything together: out most heart-wrenching breakups, our tough final-sem university projects, even had a started-up bakery business together, nothing big but it was a beautiful thing. Things seemed to go well even after we stopped the baker business to focus on our main career, she got a corp job while I still freelancing. I still pick her up from work, take her to coffee hangout and we frequently have dinner/lunch together a few times per week; until some recent incidents.  
Being her close friend, I might not be her closest one but I spent enough visits to her house for her family to know and acquaintance with me, and a few weeks ago, her mom asked my bestie if we were dating. That shocked us to the core. I'm trans-masc and ace, she's bisexual but definitely we would never date each other, so being put in such situation just feels so weird. But I was never the ""open type"" so her mom probably thought I'm some kind of masc lesbian, giving my androgynous appearance. Her mom seemed to react negatively towards the idea of us dating, and my bestie being anxious about both of us being closeted lgbtq+, just refused it briefly and never quite clarified about it. When she told me and our friends group about the situation, we took it light-heartedly, joke around so she won't have to think about it so much (she tend to be an overthinker), but deep down I know shes still fed up about it, since she started refusing my visit to her house, afraid that ""her mom might get skeptical"". I respected and understand her decision, honestly.  
The second incident is the most recent one and also is the reason we are not communicating at the moment. A few days ago, a typhoon approached our city and caused huge floods, strong storms and wrecking winds. I was safe at home, while my bestie was still at work, i messaged her saying that the streets around her house is heavily flooded and she might not be able to go home nor catch any cabs in this weather, which could result in her having to stay overnight at the office. I couldn't come get her either since my area was also heavily flooded too. And she took my words as some kind of ""misfortune whispers"", saying that I was ""cursing her to not be able to go home"" and that she wished ""lightning struck right above my head and I went perish"".

I was speechless. She did not meant it as casual joke by all mean, she went on about it for a while and said something like I ""deserved it for pissing her off."" Out of all people who death-threated me or prayed for my downfall, never in my life I would expect those kind of words to come out from her mouth. And she said that with full intend to hurt my feelings, knowing I'm seriously suicidal and just recently had a relative who lost his whole life-saving, his house and business due to fire hazards from lightning strikes. Definitely not a joke matter.  
After I confronted her if she really meant it, and did she carefully think though before saying that to me, she took a few hours to respond, not via our private DM but through my discord server chat channel, with a short apology that I didnt feel like she reflected on herself. After that I just stop interacting with her both online and irl for being so hurt. She continue went on her life like the usual, also stopped interacting with me, not even add-on affirmation if I have read her apology and how did I feel about it, as if her apology was just something she spoke out so she won't have to feel guilty, and only made it after she hanged out with other friends to lift up her mood.  
I don't know. When I toss and turn at night thinking about my value in her eyes as a friend, for everything that we been through, questioning if I ever were someone she respected or care enough; she still having fun. Her friends and coworkers still hang out with her, giving her gifts and presents, she still goes to shopping and self-care trips, update them on her socmed; while also not saying a single word to me. I would like to think that maybe shes distancing herself for feeling guilty, but her avoidance feels different from other times where we fought or argued. She feels more ""cold-hearted"" this time, I can no longer sense that warm, comforting feeling I used to have when I'm with her. If she can spurt out such words so easily, do I really matter in her social circle anymore?  
Now, I'm just idling by days, try not to think about it since i had friendship fallouts before, but they were the ones that wronged me, but this time its different. I can't help but feel so heavy of losing someone I used to considered as my ""safe"" person.

1nx12rf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nx12rf/whats_the_1_mistake_most_saas_founders_make_after/,What’s the #1 mistake most SaaS founders make after launch? My journey from 0 users to getting my first breakthrough,"Two weeks ago, I was staring at my analytics: 0 users, 0 signups, and way too much coffee. Every post, tweet, and cold email felt like shouting into the void. But instead of quitting, I switched my approach—here’s the honest breakdown:

* **I stopped pitching** and started sharing *value*: Instead of “Try my product!” posts, I shared the actual *problem* it solved and the pain points behind it.
* **Built in public, for real**: I posted behind-the-scenes updates, bug fixes, and failures—not just wins. This built trust with lurkers.
* **Asked for feedback** (not sales): Swapped pushy CTAs for “Would love your honest feedback, even if brutal.”
* **Joined conversations**, not just threads: Engaged with other founders’ questions and offered help, rather than dropping links—this actually brought curious clicks back.
* **Promised real value**: Offered a no-strings-attached exclusive (discount, free trial, whatever) for Reddit users willing to test and critique.

I’m still nowhere near product-market fit, but finally started getting signups last week—and some golden feedback that I’d have never gotten on my own.

**Would love to hear:**

* What tactics helped you go from 0 to 10, 100, or beyond?
* How do you stay motivated when nobody’s biting?
* Any feedback or savage advice welcome—roast away, or comment with your journey!",1,1759502607.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

I am 31. Had bloods done roughly 7 weeks after and my cholesterol was measured. It was 6.4mnol/l -  247 mg/dL. Don’t have a breakdown. I ate breakfast and coffee before the test as I didn’t know it was being measured but my husband said that shouldn’t inflate it. 

My doctor said not to consider it as my cholesterol a year ago was 4.4mnol/l and my body is just having trouble breaking down fats after pregnancy/loss/stress. Back then I was exercising 5-6 times a week and now I can only manage walking and Pilates. However I’m still worried and a bit of health anxiety at the moment! Does this sound ok and it will go down in time? Gave me a fright and I’m now eating better which I’m sure is a good thing anyway.

1nx11ki,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nx11ki,Built a miniature architectural model of Dupont Circle,"Wanted to share these pics of a personal art/hobby project that I completed last year, a miniature 1:430 scale model of Dupont Circle and its environs. It's the largest in a series of related projects that I'll be showing off at Heurich House this evening 6-8pm as part of the Dupont Circle First Friday ArtWalk. Come visit and take a look! 

I started this Dupont Circle piece last Fall as the weather was turning cold, and I was looking for something to do with my hands while listening to NPR / sipping coffee in the mornings. I'd estimate that it took somewhere in the ballpark of 400 hours to complete in total. This was a totally new medium for me so there was a lot of trial and error which extended the timeline. I started by creating the initial massing for each building using foamboard and then clading those with styrene sheets to form smooth white cuboids. Windows, columns, and other three dimensional detailing was meticulously added on in successive layers. Every element was individually fabricated by hand using an ever expanding toolbox of specialized equipment, including rulers and calipers in various sizes, dozens of razor blades, superglue, hot glue, fine grit sandpaper, and tweezers. Completing some of the larger and more detailed buildings could span across maybe 5-10 working sessions.

The final piece can either lay flat on a table or hang on the wall vertically. I've placed it on the wall above my computer monitor and enjoy looking at it everyday. Hope you enjoy!

Every sentence feels profound, every metaphor a gift to humanity. I lean back in my chair, bleary-eyed, thinking, “This is it. This is the chapter they’ll quote at my funeral.” 

Spoiler: no one’s quoting it, unless the eulogy needs comic relief.

The morning after is always the crime scene. I open the document with the cautious optimism of a gambler checking a lottery ticket. And there it is: 1,500 words of incoherent rambling, accidental rhymes, and dialogue that reads like a bad soap opera written by a drunk raccoon. My “hauntingly poetic” description of the night sky? Turns out it was just the word *dark* repeated nine times in different fonts.

Editing this mess is like cleaning up after a blackout party I don’t remember hosting. Half the sentences don’t even have verbs. Characters are crying in one paragraph and breakdancing in the next, with no explanation. 

I spend more time trying to figure out what Past Me was *trying* to say than actually fixing the prose. Past Me, of course, is an idiot who should have been in bed. Present Me is left holding the shovel, digging through the wreckage.

And yet, I’ll do it again. Because the curse of the writer is believing that maybe—just maybe—the next 2 a.m. session will actually birth genius instead of garbage. It won’t. But it’s comforting to think so, and besides, I’ve already got the coffee ready.

As the title says, I just moved from West Philly to East Falls. I’d lived in West Philly for about 5 years with my wife. We love it there, but after having our first baby decided we wanted a little more space and quiet. 

I’m already missing my old block. East Falls seems great but I’m worried that it’s going to be too quiet for my liking. Neighbors seem friendly, a lot of the streets are lovely for walking, and it’s nice that in walking distance to a couple coffee shops. 

Has anyone here made a similar move and could speak to your experience? I know I need to give it some time (it’s been 3 whole days haha).

1nx0rj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nx0rj6/how_does_simpure_y7_replacement_water_filter/,How does SimPure Y7 Replacement Water Filter Review Compare to Other Top Choices?,"**My Experience with the SimPure Y7/Y7P Series 6-Month Replacement Filter Pack**  

A few months ago, the SimPure Y7/Y7P Series 6-Month Replacement Filter Pack for the Y7, Y7P-W, and Y7P-BW models landed on my radar. Being someone who takes water quality seriously—especially with a family to care for—I couldn't resist testing this product myself. Mentioning as accurately as possible, the SimPure Y7/Y7P Series Filter (model: B0D1FV5N8B) certainly holds its ground in the water filtration category, but—as with everything—it’s not perfect. Here’s how it measured up in my daily routine.  

**Design & Tool-Free Installation**  

The first thing I noticed unpacking this replacement filter set was its simplicity. With its twist-in design, replacing the filters is shockingly easy. No tools, no stress—perfect for someone like me, who's moderately handy yet always short on patience. I swapped the filters in less than five minutes; that’s faster than I make my coffee most mornings. The anti-counterfeiting feature built into the packaging also gave me peace of mind about its authenticity.  

[Check SimPure Y7/Y7P Series 6-Month Replacement Filter Pack price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0d1fv5n8b/)  

**Effective Filtration Performance**  

Using this system daily, I immediately appreciated its filtration quality. This carbon-fiber-based filter ensures enhanced water purity, and every sip tastes noticeably crisper. My family, who can be discerning when it comes to water (read: picky kids!), didn’t complain about odd tastes or odors—always a bonus. The RO filter technology works fabulously, making the water suitable not just for drinking but also for cooking and even filling my espresso machine.  

However, it’s worth noting the slight variability. Water quality depends heavily on your feed water conditions. In my area, which doesn’t have heavily mineralized water, the results were superb. For those in places with higher contaminant levels, keep in mind the performance may differ.  

**Smart Indicator Light**  

The inclusion of a smart indicator light is one of those details you didn’t know you needed until you have it. It’s a lifesaver for someone absent-minded like me. Once the filter’s six-month lifespan is up or its performance dips, the light turns on, giving you a heads-up. No last-minute panic to replace your filters after realizing your water tastes off!  

**Highlights**  
- Hassle-free installation process thanks to twist-in technology.  
- Reliable filter replacement reminders via the smart indicator light.  
- Improved water taste and clarity, noticeable from the very first use.  
- Includes anti-counterfeiting features to ensure product legitimacy.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Performance can vary based on water quality in your area.  
- Might feel a bit pricey for those on a tight budget, though the value is undeniable.  

**Market Rivals**  

When pitted against its competitors like Brita’s under-sink water filters or Culligan’s countertop RO systems, this SimPure product holds its own. The quick installation process significantly outpaces Brita filters, which often require extra tools or maintenance checks. In contrast to Culligan’s systems, SimPure filters excel in taste retention and clarity without sacrificing convenience. However, Brita’s filters might win on accessibility for those living in areas where water quality is more stabilized and requires simpler filtration.  

**Cost Efficiency**  

Considering the ease of use, durability, and water quality outcome, this filter set offers notable financial value. Unlike some cheaper alternatives, this filter feels more like an investment in cleaner, healthier water. Over time, the effortless filter swaps save costs on professional assistance, and the durability stretches out its value proposition. If you're eyeing a balance between price and performance, this hits a sweet spot.

1nx0pyl,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/10/02/italys-collapsing-birthrate-is-destroying-la-dolce-vita/,Italy’s collapsing birthrate is destroying la dolce vita,"I love Italy. I love almost everything about the place. I love the taste of gelato in the sun in Calabria, I love the sweetly sad mistiness of Venice in winter. I love Ragusa, Palermo, Lecce, Genoa. I love the northern fringes where Italy melds with Germany and the Slavic world, creating the strangeness of Trieste, Bolzano, Gorizia.

I also love Italians, and whenever I go there, which is quite often as a lucky travel writer, I marvel at the general smiling charm of them all. Italians seem to be born two Aperol Spritzes ahead of everyone else in their genial and ebullient good mood, and they have a near unique gift of putting you at ease. Also, the food rocks, the girls are pretty, the art and architecture is peerless, the landscapes are often divine and the Italians instinctively understand the correct usage of coffee.

All of which makes it sad that I have to say, after a slew of recent trips all over the country – to Florence, Naples, Sicily, and others – I have realised that Italy is dying. And it is dying in a way that has some profound lessons for the rest of us.

This observation came to me in Sardinia, last week. I was on assignment to Barbagia, a haunted, epic, lush, storied corner of a remarkable island. My itinerary took me to little villages perched on impossible cliffs gazing out at the glittering Tyrrhenian Sea. It took me to whispering vineyards where they’ve been growing vines for millennia. In ancient forests I found shepherds speaking Sardinian, probably the nearest language to Latin. Talking to these men is as linguistically close as you can get to talking to Cicero or Caesar. In short, Sardinia was as beautiful as I expected, but in one way it was entirely shocking.

Why? Because it is so old and there are so few children. The numbers back this up. Sardinia had just 0.91 children per woman in 2023. That means the island has the lowest fertility rate in Italy, itself one of the world’s least fertile nations. Every single Sardinian province now has a fertility rate below one child per woman, with women becoming first-time mothers at age 33.2 years, the oldest in the country.

The ageing crisis is equally dramatic. The average age has risen to 48.8 years. For every child, there are now 7.4 elderly people, compared to just one elderly person per child in 1951. Emigration only adds to these problems as young Sardinians disappear, creating a doom loop where the exodus of young people shrinks the customer base and stifles economic vitality.

What’s more, you can feel this ageing and this childlessness. When the beach crowds vanish and the mainlanders fly away, Sardinia is like one giant, if lovely, care home for oldsters. As I drove through town after town, I kept seeing those normal gaggles of old men you get in dusty Mediterranean squares, playing cards, gossiping, necking wine at 9am. Except in Sardinia the gaggles have become armies, great platoons of pensioners, like the birds multiplying on wires in Hitchcock’s The Birds. And there are barely any children.

Is this all reversible? One hopes so, naturally. The Italian government is doing its damnedest to boost the birth rate. But if it fails, and if the Italians don’t start making more Italians quite soon, then the most charming people in the world will fade away to oblivion. Which is quite a sobering thought for the rest of us, as birthrates around the world copy the Italian pattern, the way we once copied their cooking, their art and their enviable way of life.",4,1759501782.0,demography,1,1.0,False

Hey Maximizame crew,

Ever feel like you're operating at 90% capacity? Like that ""ultimate self"" is just around the corner, but you can't quite figure out the final turn to get there?

The secret isn't some massive life overhaul. It's about small, smart optimizations. It's about working with the life you *already have* and making it just a little bit better, every single day.

Here are a few simple ideas that have made a huge difference for me:

*   **Embrace the 1% Daily Upgrade.** Forget ""I'm going to read 50 books this year."" Instead, try ""I'm going to read for 5 minutes before bed."" Instead of ""I'm going to start a business,"" think ""I'm going to brainstorm one idea today."" These tiny, almost-too-easy wins compound like crazy. It’s the magic of marginal gains. 📈

*   **Conduct a Weekly 'Joy Audit'.** Seriously. Take 10 minutes every Sunday and ask yourself: ""What one small thing brought me genuine, uncomplicated joy this week?"" Was it that first sip of coffee in total silence? A song you rediscovered? A 5-minute chat with a friend? Identify it, and then figure out how to intentionally schedule more of *that* into the next week. It's proactive happiness. 😊

*   **The Two-Minute 'Mind Dump'.** When your brain feels like a browser with 50 tabs open, grab a pen and paper. For two straight minutes, write down *everything* on your mind. Worries, to-do's, random ideas, grocery lists... get it all out. Don't edit, don't judge. This simple act frees up an incredible amount of mental RAM.

Sometimes, the biggest hurdle isn't a messy to-do list, but the emotional static behind it. Getting your systems in order is one thing, but getting your head and heart aligned is the real game-changer. If you're feeling stuck in that part of the journey and need a more structured way to navigate those feelings, I've found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to be incredibly helpful for creating a personal emotional support plan.

Remember, it's all about small hinges swinging big doors. We're all on this path together, just trying to level up one day at a time.

So, what’s one simple ‘life optimization’ you’ve tried that's made a real difference for you? Let's share some ideas in the comments. 👇",1,1759501522.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Hi guys,

So this started as a side project out of pure curiosity. I wanted to see if it was possible to go from an idea → to a full personalized book in minutes.

After a bunch of late nights and way too much coffee, I ended up with something that actually works: an AI book generator that creates custom books on literally any topic you feed it.

I’ve been testing it with friends (one made a “Dad jokes survival guide,” another did “AI investing 101”), and the results have been pretty wild.

I’d love some feedback from you all—what kind of book would you generate if you had the chance?

1nx0gwr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nx0gwr,About John’s trip to Iceland in 1997.,"John went to Iceland on 8/9/1997 and stayed for five days. He went with three of his friends and they called their group the four ‘J’s. It was John (Kennedy), another John, James Alden, and Josh Tager. Here are some details from his trip written in an Icelandic newspaper. It’s translated so it might read a little weird.

John F. Kennedy Jr. went on a five-day trip through the Westfjords with three of his companions. When the companions arrived in the country, they requested to be left alone from the media and other intrusions, and their journey has therefore been very secretive. The four call themselves ""The Four J's"" or J-in mórður. They go on kayaking trips to exotic places once a year and have, for example, been to the coast of Alaska and rowed from Sweden to Finland. In this country, they traveled through the Ultima Thule tourism company in Reykjavík, which was responsible for providing them with the necessary equipment and giving them a tour guide.

According to the newspaper, the companions stopped at Hotel Fiókalundur in Vatnsfjörður where they had a meal. They went directly from Keflavík in a rental SUV that went to Hotel Flókalund in Vatnsfjörður. There they also picked up two kayaks, but they themselves had brought two collapsible boats with them and then set off on adventures in Jökulfjörður and around Ísafjarðardjúp. ""They sailed around Jökulfjörður and then along the way they went to Sandeyri in Ísafjarðardjúp. From there they sailed over to Seyðisfjörður and stayed in a hut by Folafót,"" said Konráð Eggertsson, captain, who assisted the companions on the journey through the northern Westfjords.

Kayaking at Kambsnes Two employees of Bæjarinn besta in Ísafjörður, Jón Oddur Guðmunds-son and Halldór Sveinbjörnsson, had heard that the foursome were expected in Súðavík after noon on Sunday and rowed their own kayaks to meet them. Halldór, the photographer, said that the weather had been bad that day, 7 wind speeds and the vessels were quite rough.

""When we arrived at Kambsnes between Seyðisfjörður and Álftafjörður and saw the entrance to Seyðisfjörður, we intended to turn back, as we assumed that they had paused their journey because the sea was so bad. As we were about to turn back, I saw two men carrying kayaks in the rocky area of Kambsnes and we went ashore. Not far away was the third man, but John F. Kennedy was still out at sea. He came ashore and the companions discussed what to do next, but then decided to accept our guidance into Súðavík."" The Americans went too close to land, where there was a risk of rocks and shallows causing them to capsize. ""I signaled them to go outside. Then it became clear that one of them was quite tired, although not Kennedy. I tied the tired kayak to the back of mine and pulled him past Kambsnes. When we arrived at the headland, it was easy to get to Súðavík. They were in no danger, although they agreed to be in the same raft with us and had no words to express their pleasure at sailing around Jökulfjörður, as the weather the previous days had been very good.""

Upon arrival in Súðavík, the four Js thanked the workers by giving them kayaking suits as a gift. When they were said goodbye, the companions headed for Ísafjörður to the home of Konráður Eggertsson. Mixed rhubarb porridge, skyr and cream ""They came to our house and ate rhubarb porridge and skyr and just liked it. John F. Kennedy is the first man I have ever seen eat rhubarb porridge and skyr with cream together. I tried this on Monday and I can tell you that this is a great meal - this together here. There were people eating here earlier and they tried this and liked it. They were absolutely exceptionally normal people, polite and pleasant,"" said Konráð.

Two BB employees met the companions at Kambsnes, between Seyðisfjörður and Álftafjörður, around noon on Sunday and sailed with them to Súðavík. Upon arrival there, they were given a place in the newspaper's vehicle to change clothes and then thanked the staff by bringing them kayaking jackets as a gift. When they were dismissed, the companions headed for Ísafjörður to Konráð Eggertsson's home.

""They came to my husband's house and ate rhubarb porridge and skyr and they just liked it. John F. Kennedy is the first man I have ever seen eat rhubarb porridge and skyr with cream together. I tried this since today (Monday) and I can tell you that this is a great meal. I will definitely be eating this together again in the future. ""There were people here for dinner earlier and they tried it and liked it. They were extremely normal people, polite and approachable,"" said Konrad.

According to the newspaper, John F. Kennedy stopped at the Gullaugi store in Ísafjörður, where he purchased a gold ring with an Icelandic stone for his wife, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. From Ísafjörður, the companions headed to Flókalund where they returned the kayaks, then took the Breiðafjörður ferry Baldur over to Stykkishólmur and stayed overnight in Borgarnes. Baldvin Kristjánsson of Ultima Thule said that the foursome had been very humble and easy-going. ""They found our travel service on the Internet, where we specifically promote kayaking trips in the Westfjords. We only took care of providing them with equipment, directions and a ride across the Deep. Our trips have attracted attention in the United States, as they are fully comparable to other kayaking trips.

Lilja Osk (little girl in the picture) and Lilja Ósk's mother, Bergþóra Reynisdóttir, said that they had been on a group trip with the Icelandic Tourist Board around Hornstrandir.

Lilja recalled ""I was in Grunnavík, Hornstrand, with my mother for a seven-day tour. There was a regular boat with us, and one time I heard the captain say that John Kennedy Jr was on a similar track as we were on a kayak trip"". Lilja was only ten years old and did not know who this man was but noticed that all the women in the group got excited with the news.

""We just happened to be at the same crazy isolated place at the same time! We were hiking in a place in Iceland called Hornstrandir (west part of Iceland) and it is just pure nature and no phones, no electricity or nothing. One afternoon we were out walking, sitting in the beach relaxing and warming coffee and baking peanuts from the porridge which was left over from the morning. All of a sudden we saw four kayaks coming in front of the mountain Máríuhorn. We went down to the beach and waved and shouted. They came ashore and we invited them in for coffee. The group of friends called themselves The Four J's because they were named John, Jim, Josh and John and they were so polite .JFK jr. even washed up his dishes! We baked for them pancakes and oat porridge dumplings. ""John was very impressed with the dumplings and ate a lot of them, I had recently moved back from England at that time so my English was fluent. I sat next to him and we talked for a while about the schools in Iceland, We talked about a lot of things, for example, I told him I had a cat and he said he had a dog and a cat. He said his wife Carolyn was not that into kayaking and it was just a boys trip. Before they left they all took a shot of the strong Icelandic drink called Brennivín (40-50% alcohol) and he had to drink a lot of water afterwards! it was just pure joy spending the afternoon with them.

Bergþóra got Kennedy's permission to take a few photographs, including of him and Lilja.

Lilja Ósk said that she had known who John F. Kennedy was. ""I asked him what his name was, but he just said his name was John. Then I asked what his last name was and he smiled and said his name was John F. Kennedy. He was very nice and fun to talk to."" Before Kennedy and his companions continued their journey, the Icelandic travelers took turns singing a few Icelandic songs for them. They thanked them and wrote kind greetings in the house's guest book. ",16,1759501198.0,JohnAndCarolyn,2,0.95,False
1nx0fv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anemic/comments/1nx0fv9/feeling_lousy_after_supplements/,Feeling lousy after supplements,"I recently started an iron supplement every other day with vitamin c in the morning on an empty stomach 2 hours before coffee - due to really low ferritin and iron saturation. Iron I take is 65mg (325 mg ferrous sulfate)

I also started vitamin d (w K2) and b12 bc my numbers were very low there too. 

On days I take the iron, I just feel sluggish all day and by the evening my hips start aching and I have a headache like I’m hungover or something (no alcohol consumed) Is this expected and something my body will move through to start feeling better?

1nx0dph,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nx0dph/she_broke_up_with_me_now_im_lost/,She Broke Up With Me Now I’m Lost.,"
I apologize for the long vent.

I feel like each day is on repeat. In the mornings, I feel terrible— all I can do is think about her. She’s not next to me, and my apartment feels empty. But throughout the day, I rationalize and put myself in a better place, only to wake up and feel the same the next day. She broke up with me this past Monday. 

We had been together for just under two years. About three weeks ago, she went on a week-long trip with her dad and a family friend; I wasn’t able to go. When she got back, I went on a work trip, and while I was away, things felt different. Our communication felt distant. She told me she felt homesick. I tried my best to show compassion and let her know I was there for her.

For context, we live in a city where both our families are two hours away in opposite directions. Nothing really keeps us tied to the city other than our jobs.

When I got back from my work trip, we went on vacation to Florida. It was more of the same — things just felt off — but I told myself it was fine, that I was just overanalyzing. I asked if she was okay a couple of times, and she said she was just tired.

When we got home from vacation, it was still a lot of the same. We would be in bed, and she would be on her phone with her back to me. I would reach out to touch her, to let her know I was there, but she ignored me. I’d just say good night and go to sleep.

The next two days, she went to work while I was still off. I tried to be as supportive as possible—making sure chores were done, dinner was ready, etc. I’d ask how her day went, and she would just say, “I don’t want to talk about it.” I knew she had been off for two weeks, and with the stress of a new supervisor structure at work, I didn’t want to push it.

The next day, while we were eating dinner, she asked me what keeps me at my current job. I explained my reasons: good pay, not being micromanaged, and it allows me to work on my passions. She acknowledged my answer and then told me she intends to move to a different city closer to her family when her lease is up, and that she would like me to come. She also said she had no intention of a long-distance relationship.

I was shocked. It came out of nowhere. She went on to say she wants to be closer to her family, that she has no consistent friends where we currently live, and that she doesn’t like her job with all the change that has happened. She said the only reason she stays is because of me. That conversation turned everything upside down. The rest of the night, we barely talked.

I couldn’t sleep. I tossed and turned, eventually going to the living room to lie on the couch. I didn’t sleep at all. The next morning, she got ready for work and walked out the door without saying a word. When she got home, it was much the same. We didn’t really talk.

The next day, I asked her to have dinner with me so we could discuss everything. I spoke with my parents, my therapist, my best friend, and someone I look up to for honest feedback. I had decided that I would make the move for her because that’s how much I cared and loved her, even though I knew I was being given an ultimatum.

I waited at home for her to get back from work. She came in, barely talked to me, and stayed distant. She got changed, and we went to dinner.

I asked if she was still in love with me, and she said yes. I felt I needed to know that before telling her my decision. I explained to her that I was willing to make the move with her but that we needed to make a plan. We couldn’t just up and leave and quit our jobs. The conversation seemed productive at first. But as we were talking, she said she wanted to talk about finances.

Throughout our relationship, she had pressed this. I’m not going to say I was perfect—I bought stupid stuff—but my bills were paid and I never had to beg for money. I have some debt from bad decisions earlier in life, but we had sat down and made a plan for me to be debt-free within a year to a year and a half. It felt like telling her that wasn’t enough.

While we were talking, she mentioned taking my paycheck and giving me an allowance, which I said no to. I felt it wasn’t her place — I wasn’t asking to see her finances or questioning her unnecessary purchases. I knew when we got to the point of marriage, we’d have that conversation, but I didn’t think now was the time when we were trying to work through moving. I asked her to table the finances conversation until the end of the year. If we were going to move, we’d start looking for jobs and places to live at the beginning of the year. She was hesitant but agreed.

The conversation continued, and while I shouldn’t have done it, I told her how appreciative I was of her for pushing me to do therapy. I explained the growth and understanding I’d gained and asked her if she would consider going herself, given how the past couple days had went. She flat-out said no. It hurt, because I wanted to see that growth in both of us. I know there are things in her past—just like all of us—that could be beneficial to talk through in therapy.

Fast forward to us getting back home. We pulled up in the driveway and she said, “Don’t expect things to just go back to normal.” It came out of nowhere. I asked her what she meant, but there wasn’t a clear answer other than, “Don’t expect the intimacy to be the same.”

We walked into her apartment, and I decided to go back to mine for the night. We hugged and kissed. She seemed concerned, asking if I had toiletries and clothes there. (I had moved into her apartment about five months into our relationship.) I left, let her know when I got home, and told her I loved her and to have a good night. She responded, “Love you too, sleep well.”

The next morning, I texted her hoping her day would go well. There was no response. I was at her apartment waiting for her to get home. When she came in, she was distant again, giving short responses. She was preparing to go spend time with her dad at a show he does—something we’d talked about before everything happened. She said she was running late. I asked how I could help. She said she didn’t know. I asked if she wanted me to get her duffle bag. She said she didn’t know what she was going to use.

I walked out of the bedroom, thinking she wanted space. Shortly after she  walked past me, got her duffle bag, and went back to the bedroom. I was dumbfounded, trying to figure out what I did. Shortly after, she came into the dining room where I was, put her shoes on, and said, “We need to talk about finances when I get back.”

She was about to walk out the door, and I told her to stop. I asked her what was going on. All the things we’d talked about, and that’s what she was stuck on? I let my frustration out, explaining to her that I pay my bills, I’m handling my debt, I don’t know what more she wants. I broke down. I’d hit the end of my rope trying to stay positive. It felt like I knew what was coming and she just wouldn’t say it. She reached in for a hug and I hesitated, since I had just broken down. She moved back in shock, and then I pulled her in for a hug. She walked out the door.

I didn’t hear from her again until Monday morning when she said we needed to talk. I knew what was coming. I went to her place, and she said she loves me but she wants to break up. I broke down. She didn’t really give me a reason that, in my eyes, called for such an extreme decision.

I packed most of my stuff, filled my car, and she gave me a long hug. I was confused and wrecked at this point. The next day, I went back to get the rest of my stuff. We talked again and she said she loves me and I’m her best friend. She said I’m an amazing guy. I tried to be careful with my words, but I asked if there was still a chance because I didn’t want to lose her. She looked at me and said, “You have lost me.” But then she said if I still move to the other city, there’s a chance, and that she’d like to meet for coffee in a couple of weeks. Will that happen? I don’t know.

Our relationship had been good, with just a couple of disagreements we worked through. I love this girl to death. She was special to me, and I really thought she would be my wife. I had even begun looking at engagement rings. It all just turned on its head without any real reason that I can see. I look at myself and blame myself for this ending. But I tried I can’t blame myself. 

It hurts. I want to speak to her, but I know it gets me nowhere. She’s made her decision. I still feel alone, lost, and like a failure. I feel like I lost the best thing in my life. I hope it gets easier, but it’s hard to accept.

And real question what the hell does let’s get coffee in two weeks mean? 

Thank you everyone in this group. The love and encouragement here has helped me know I’m not alone in the hurt. Again, I apologize for the long story. I just needed to get it off my chest. ",3,1759500987.0,BreakUps,1,0.81,False
