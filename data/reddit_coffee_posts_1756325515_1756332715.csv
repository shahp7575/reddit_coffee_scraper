1n1ur1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverdating/comments/1n1ur1e/long_weekend_date_37f4m/,Long Weekend Date 37F4M,"Single, 37F4M. Anyone interested in going for a fun date this long weekend? It's my first free weekend in awhile and I'd love to make a connection and go do something fun. 

Meet for coffee? Go for brunch? To the movies? Chill at the hookah lounge? Picnic at the park? Comedy show? Hang by the ocean? Other ideas...? 

I'm a working professional, white, short, a plus size babe with dark hair and eyes. What I might lack in the 'typical hot girl' looks department, I make up for with a great personality and sense of humor. I'm very chill and easy to get along with. If you're interested in someone who is genuine, kind, independent, fun, passionate/loving, and open minded... then we might just hit it off! I'd enjoy hearing from you.

Ultimately I'm looking for a LTR, but not wanting to rush anything. A genuine, authentic connection that builds on itself is everything. I'd prefer to meet someone out in the real world, but thought I'd see what might become from posting here. 

If you'd like to chat, send me a message and tell me a bit about yourself!

African/Caribbean men, I'd especially love to hear from you :) 


Be well!

Maybe she’s looking out for me but it felt a bit like she was judging me, it was a bit overbearing and like she was acting like she’s better than me. I wasn’t running on a lot of sleep today because I work a lot of evening shifts but today I had my only early morning shift of the week, so I was a little slow. After my morning shift I met her with some other friends to go out for one of their birthdays. I had an iced coffee and then then a red bull and vodka a bit later, she commented that I needed to stop drinking so much caffeine because it’s really bad for me. I said I usually only have one red bull or one coffee per day, but it’s a special occasion. She was acting as though I was on crack or something, repeatedly saying I shouldn’t be drinking it. Then I forgot a couple of things and told her I had to rehearse a drink name in my head before ordering. She said my brain shouldn’t be slowing down this much at my age and said “what has happened to you??” I was probably just a bit sleep deprived but I am diagnosed with depression which doesn’t help with my memory and focus. She made the “what is happening to you” comment a few times even if I forgot something minor or said something a bit silly. Then I randomly did that thing where I swallowed the wrong way and started choking a little, I said that was the second time that’s happened to me this week and laughed it off as me being too dumb to swallow right. She said I need to see a doctor and it was a problem with my brain or something. Later on, I mentioned to her that I’ve been getting back pain. She said I need to be taking better care of myself and that she is older than me and doesn’t get back pain. Keep in mind I have a fairly physical job and my cup size is F, so it makes sense to get some back pain imo. I couldn’t help but feel annoyed at the repeated comments about how I have these supposed problems that I have at my age and she doesn’t at her age. It makes me think she felt some sort of superiority over me, likes she takes much better care of herself. I could have excused one or two comments, but it kept going on repeatedly the whole time I was out with her. I was there to have fun, not be lectured. I don’t know, was she just being caring and I’m just being a bit insecure? Or was this actually judgemental and overbearing behaviour?",2,1756332424.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

(just wish my f/o was more known than froggit no74)

her ""family"" is cool too, heats flamesman and grillby's even if we dont even know if both are actually her family, although on a happier note i saw some cool fanart of her while writing this, idk if i can post it here since im not the creator but its the best fanart of her ive seen.

also saw a darkworld sprite so thats cool too, otherwise most people tend to ignore her.

i also saw a sans ship with her?? they havent even been anywhere close to eachother so thats dumb, and also a oversexualized 3d print of her, would be cool to have a figure but im not printing that even if i would get it for free lol

actually im beginning to see a bit more good quality fanart of her, thats nice.

  
sorry for bad grammar but how do people make characters for/of themselves in anything? i dont want to be me, idk how to make art of me with her if im gonna, im learning pixel art and wanna but i dont wanna make a person thats supposed to represent me irl, maybe just a blob or a soul, actually my favorite player self insert in any game might be the heart in deltarune in terms on how its shown, if we could leave noelle's house without kris and float around i'd be happy, that was my favorite part of the game, except (exept?) maybe something else

  
im not posting this anywhere except my profile ofcourse, because i dont want it to be deleted, sorry if i sound sad in this im not, im just not happy either.

  
i would like to learn an instrument, i dont know what, those that look and sound cool are super hard to learn (electric guitar) or feels bad to play (those cool flutes i forgot name of).

this became a long post, i know or maybe i hope nobody reads this, at the same time i hope someone comments on this. thats a weird feeling

  
you know, i think life is beautiful, just because it has so many confusing thoughts, i feel smart but i will probably never figure any of this out, and thats good, lets stay like that.

  
i have alot to talk about, did you know that?

i like talking too

there are so many things to like in this earth, i guess i lied earlier in the post, i am sad, but only because others are sad and hateful, those are feelings we can avoid, or we can find outlets other than pushing them on others. thats philosophical is it not?

  
please dont end your life whoever is reading this, i will get sad, and also even if you dont want to end your life or have thoughts of it, thats good, stay alive and experience the joys of life without bringing anyone else down, please help them too.

  
i could write a book, like whats it called

actually i dont know

search up philosophy books and pretend i knew enough to reference one and compare this to it

that would be funny

  
but there is alot of bad philosophy, so please have good philosophy, but dont be too happy, you might start ignoring the world's problems

  
extremism and  are two things you shouldnt ignore, i think those people are bad, i also feel a bit bad for them that they become like that, i wouldnt like to become like that, but anyone can become anything if pressured enough, i think of it like drug addicts, although maybe im too forgiving and i shouldnt assume they have good in them.

maybe they are pure evil like they show



personally im more left wing but im not really far left, im somewhat opposed to capitalism but im also kinda opposed to communism atleast in what has been done before, i just want whatever makes society work so if something makes it work and doesnt oppress people thats really my only political opinion, i cant know perfectly that that is the left wing so i dont want anyone who likes capitalism and disagrees with me to dislike me, im fine with that too, i just really want everyone to be happy and healthy and have a good life, please dont do drugs it wont make you and others happy.

  
thats too much politics, politics gives me a bad feeling

  
speaking about my f/o gets me a bit

sombre is the word i just searched up for a definition, not sad honestly.

so when im like that i often think more, and then i have many thoughts

look below, i wrote something there

i like her, have a good day, i cant imagine you read this and i expect you skipped to the 2nd last line you saw or the one above this or below this, but even so im surprised you clicked, or maybe you gave up while reading up there and realized i have some special thing in my brain, i do but i wont talk about that, if you read, please tell me, i would really like to know

look above, thats the real final response

I am not eating before I take it. If I do eat breakfast, I try to hit the magical window of 30 mins after and before I am just completely grossed out by food. 

I take vitamins and supplements in the morning (will give a list for feedback) and just found out that citrus and vitamin C blocks absorption - ugh. So now I will be moving that supplement to later in the day like lunch or after work.

I do drink but not like a large amount, more socially, sometimes a lil night cap. I know my Dr said to basically just not drink at all but like sometimes I need a little wind down.

My psychiatrist basically told me to stop smoking flower and even though I barely even smoke, she said it can hinder the effectiveness. Although idk why if I'm doing it at midnight to go bed (I have insomnia and it calms me down a bit).

I am trying to figure out why I'm literally like ready to fall asleep at 4/5pm.. I take it like 8:30am. 

Supplements I'm taking:  Crane Wellness Nattokinase Blend (heart health and circulation and endometriosis) and their Kelp Iodine (hormonal balance), Nature's Fusions Neuro NAC and NMNH (more brain function, cognitive), Auri Lions Mane drops (yep, brain), Vitamin D3, Magnesium Glycinate, sometimes a Biotin gummy... oh and Genius BCAA energy powder, and a pure Creatine 10mg a day. 

I know that sounds like a lot but its not all at one time either lol. Break it up throughout the day.  

I don't drink coffee but do have a bit of caffeine, no more than 100mg per day.

today he told me he’s leaving because i said we didn’t have time to make coffee before going on a road trip. he then called me weak for staying with him despite how he treats me and said he’s glad he doesn’t have to pretend to care about me.

this usually would’ve broke me but i’ve been processing and accepting our situation and he just happened to blow it up early. after hearing those words i lost any respect i had. 

i am the mother of his child and he has treated me like garbage but now i am free. i’m grateful for this experience because i have my beautiful baby girl i never would’ve met otherwise and this has taught me that to love my daughter i need to love myself. luckily i’ll be with family for 5 days so it won’t be too bad. just posting because it has been a lot today.

instant switch to hating me because of coffee. i’ve dealt with this for almost 3 years and have always been blamed for his behavior. i know now it’s not my fault and never has been. yes i wasn’t perfect but i’ve been going to therapy and groups to work on myself while he has stagnated. it was never me. if you’re in this situation my heart goes out to you. you deserve better",1,1756331910.0,breakingmom,1,0.99,False

How about a digital duo, where we chat about our chaotic daily lives, wild weekend plans, and those deep, dark dreams (or at least the ones we're willing to admit).

Since we're keeping it 100% online, it's the perfect setup to spill your guts with brutal honesty or spin the most elaborate tall tales imaginable. Who's to say?

If you're game to be my pixelated partner, bring some smarts or serious creativity to fake it, a flair for words, and enough sass to keep things spicy. Above all, your humor better be sharp, I refuse to banter with anyone who can't land a punchline.

Hopefully you're cool with my right-of-center politics, because nothing says fun chat like debating without devolving into a meme war.

I've put together a detailed itinerary and I'm looking for some feedback from experienced travelers.

Here's my current plan. I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether this is a good idea for a short, busy weekend, any must-see stops I'm missing, or if anything seems too ambitious.

**My Plan: The New England Coastal Loop**

**Day 1: Friday - The Drive to Maine**

* **7:00 AM:** Leave Jersey City.
* **Morning Stops:** Quick breaks in **Mystic, CT** and **Newport, RI** for coffee and to see the towns.
* **Afternoon Stop:** Walk around **Portsmouth, NH** for a bit.
* **Evening:** Arrive and check into **Black Elephant Hostel** in **Portland, ME**.
* **Goal:** Have dinner and explore Portland's Old Port.

**Day 2: Saturday - A Day in Coastal Maine**

* **Morning:** Visit **Portland Head Light** in Cape Elizabeth.
* **Afternoon:** Drive up scenic **Route 1** to **Camden, ME**, with stops in **Wiscasset** and **Rockland** for photos and walks.
* **Evening:** Return to Portland for a final night in the city.

**Day 3: Sunday - The Return Loop**

* **Morning Stops:** Walk the **Marginal Way** in **Ogunquit, ME**, and explore **Kennebunkport, ME**.
* **Afternoon Stops:** Drive to **Concord, MA** to see the historic Old North Bridge, then a quick stop in **Worcester, MA** for a coffee.
* **Late Evening:** Drive back to Jersey City, arriving around 10 PM.

Ok, I said I’d provide an update to this wrongful ticket saga.  Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/s/F64zCIjvsn

I got the ticket in October and pushed as far as I could per the online advice, I did the trial by declaration in April and I was found guilty and when I went to the clerk and requested the officer’s declaration, he wrongly stated I was going the same direction of the bus; not the opposite as I actually was. They found me guilty but reduced the fine to $500 from $690. 

It’s the principle of being right, so I requested a trial de novo following the 12 steps from r/californiatickethelp. I had to stay on top of everything because the court didn’t even mail the decision until AFTER the appeal period was up, if I hadn’t been checking online on the decision, I would have gotten it too late for me to request a new trial, it’s by design for us to give up or miss deadlines. 

I really prepared for the court date, printing the receipt of the coffee shop where I got coffee that morning and the GPS route I took, to prove the direction I was going in (west to east) to prove I was NOT going the same direction as the bus. I even requested the body cam footage but LAPD has yet to provide it, shocker. 

Court date  was today and the officer didn’t show up so case was dismissed and the bail amount will be returned to me per the judge. 👩‍⚖️

***>Measurement and time units will be automatically converted to human measurement units.*** 

==================================

*Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: Early March 7th, 2130.*

 *\[36 hours until Operation Void Whisper\]*

***Memory transcription subject***: ***No one, third person POV.***

*Location: UN Space Forces Command Center, Earth.*

A man, Pierre Charbonneau, stood in front of a large crowd once again.

""Good Morning everyone, you remember me, probably, we're here for the final meeting before the start of Operation Void Whisper.

You've done your job well, each one of you and your respective teams did, from what I've seen on your reports and the plans you've made, the Operation was *supposed* to go smoothly, I assume each team reviewed the plans of the other teams as well, right?""

A collective wave of nods and affirmative gestures swept through the people present.

""Then you're aware that a few of the teams involved in this operation have encountered possible problems. I will pass on the microphone to one of the strategists responsible for one of the teams that reported the problem on their document.""

He proceeded to leave the stage, after a few moments, a woman appeared, quickly tapping the microphone a few times, before speaking.

""Hello everyone, my name is Stephane, I'm the leader of the third group that's participating on this operation. A few hours ago, we came across a possible issue that our probes are most likely going to face, at least a few you might have encountered the same issue as my team did.

The issue in question is the amount of ships travelling through the most important worlds of the Federation, it appears that we underestimated just how much traffic there would be on the surrounding space of said planets.

There is, however, a solution, one that many of you might've come up with on your own, and it's sending your probes below or above the [Ecliptic Plane](https://www.asteroidmission.org/galleries/word-of-the-week/ecliptic-plane/) of the main star systems that we are going to send your probes to.

But that doesn't mean it will be easy. Some of the target worlds, like Aafa or Nishtal, have regular patrols on those parts of their systems too.

That's why I've come up with another possible solution to be able to get a better look at those planets. But I would like to know everyone's opinion on it.

We could try and have the probes that will be sent to those systems fly close to their host stars and mask them as passing asteroids, said maneuvers would make them *significantly* harder to detect due to the brightness of the stars, and since they are so small, spotting them would become very, *very* difficult.""

A few people amongst the crowd started to whisper between themselves.

""You do know that the amount of calculations needed to be made to allow the hyperdrives to allow a jump *that* close to the gravity well of a star would be *several* orders of magnitude higher than the amount needed for a jump to a distance of a few light-hours away like the majority of the probes will execute, right?"" One of the bystanders pointed out.

""And what about it?"" She checked her watch, ""we still have a 36 hours until the probes launch, and we *do* have the computational capacity to allow such jumps to occur. But instead of a few dozen minutes of work the quantum computers would usually do, they would need to work for around 12 hours or so for the jumps to *enter* the influence of the gravity well, but only a few hours to exit it, *specially* if we leave the computers running the math on the background.

It's definitely possible, and as far as I know, the Void Arrows *can* withstand the harsh conditions for the amount of time they would need to collect the information we want them to get, and since they are a lot smaller than a lot of asteroids, they would also be much, *much* harder to spot.

Plus, they don't emit a subspace trail like those emitted by Federation vessels, I pretty much doubt they would be able to detect them, which would allow us to go unnoticed by their patrol vessels and monitoring equipment. After all, *who in their right minds* would fly something so close to a star? I pretty much doubt they would monitor the proximities of their stars. We only need the probes to handle the harsh conditions for 3 hours, it isn't *that* far fetched, and much easier than having to dodge around hundreds of patrol vessels.""

A few people mumbled between themselves again, some agreeing with the proposal.

""The sensors of the void arrows will *also* be affected by the insane luminosity of the stars? Your proposal might as well be a waste of time."" Another person pointed out.

""The probes don't need to get *that* close to the stars, just enough that they would be able to safely spy on their targets, passing a few hundred thousand kilometers away from the coronas *should* be enough, plus, there's a lot of different ways of protecting the equipment from the intense light.""

""But still-""

Pierre could only shake his head while observing from the side, the strategies were all already being implemented and being coded into the probes, the meeting was more of a way of sharing the information and plans each team had made. But it appeared that this meeting in specific was going to last a lot longer than planned...

================================================================

\[Time skip: 5 hours\]

***Memory Transcription Subject: Vyly, Commander of the third Venlil Scouting and Self Defense Fleet.*** 

The humans were crazy. *Definitely crazy.*

I didn't wholeheartedly believe Kam when he told me that we would probably be docking on a structure that *extended all the way up to space.* But apparently, he wasn't lying.

But here I was, the elite boarding squad that was part of fleet and I, travelling aboard one of our transport ships, nearing Earth, and man, *that thing is* ***huge!***

Even from half a million *kilometers* away, it was still visible to the naked eye! How would you even *connect* such a tether all the way up from orbit to the surface of a planet? I could only imagine the amount of work that went into such a structure, brahk, the Federation most likely wouldn't have the budget to allow such a *mighty* construction to be built!

""Boss? Are you sure that coming here was a good idea?"" One of the members of the boarding squad, Vryt, spoke up, snapping me from my thoughts.

""Why do you ask, Vryt? You know how things work, Kam orders, we follow or object if we find them to be dangerous or unhinged, simple, and I worked with the humans before, they're surprisingly friendly, and *normally* aren't stupid, with a few exceptions. Trust my judgement, if Kam of all people, as distrustful as he is, *trusts them*, then we can certainly trust them, too.""

His body briefly tensed before he managed to calm himself down again. I think that everyone aboard was nervous, well, *except for me*. But I could understand their perspective, It was one thing to be forced to work with ships filled with flesh eating beings in your fleet, it was a *different* thing entirely to work *alongside them*, face to face, when you were *trained* to kill those types of things.

If it was up to them, I don't doubt they would've refused to visit Earth, but well, you can't *exactly* refuse the orders of your war advisor without consequences, thankfully, they were able to swallow their hatred for... *carnivores,* and agreed to the job without putting up much of a fight.

""Alright, the ship traffic control of the Space Elevator has authorized us to dock, estimated time until docking: 4 *hours*. I've toggled the ship's auto pilot, things should be smoother now, feel free to relax, boss."" Roldn, both our pilot and one of the members of the boarding squad spoke up while leaving the controls, ""I'm going to grab something to eat, do you guys want to come?""

I gave him a tail flick, ""I'm going to meet you there shortly, just need to confirm a few things with the humans.""

I quickly grabbed my holo pad and then called Nikolai, it was obvious the trip down to the surface was going to take *hours* to reach the surface. It wasn't as if our own vessel was capable of atmospheric flight, it was made with space patrolling and operations in micro gravity, after all, but there *had* to be a quicker way to Earth's surface. It wasn't possible that the humans got rid of *all* of the other means of getting down... Did they?

Luckily, Kam had introduced me to him before we left, it was going to make things significantly easier, and it wasn't long before he answered.

""Hello Vyly! Nice to see you contacting me! Can I help you with something?""

""Hello Nikolai, how are you? I wanted to ask a question, do you mind answering them?

""Sure, if it isn't beyond what I know, I don't see a problem.""

""Isn't there any way for us to skip the whole process of going down the Space Elevator? I don't want to spend *hours* travelling down the tether.""

He stayed silent for a few minutes.

""Well, I supose that you and your crew *could* go down on one of our Heavy Cargo Shuttles, they can carry a few dozen passengers on their passenger compartment, but they mainly work on carrying cargo back to Earth that's too heavy for the Space Elevator to handle, well, not that they can *carry* any meaningful amount of cargo *up* due to the absurd amount of delta-v needed to achieve orbit, though.""

*...What kind of vehicle can carry cargo down to the surface but not they way around???*

""What do you mean by that? What kind of vehicle can only carry cargo down?"" I pondered.

""[Single Stage to Orbit vehicles](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234256118_Concept_definition_and_design_of_a_single-stage-to-orbit_launch_vehicle-hyperplane), of course! They only became possible to build like, 20 *years* ago, but after we managed to come up with lightweight heat resistant alloys, working scramjet engines {three citations for this technology: [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramjet#Orbital_vehicles) [\[2\]](https://blog.gridpro.com/hypersonic-flights-by-scramjet-engines) [\[3\]](https://hyperlab.nd.edu/research/scramjet-aerodynamics)}, and more more efficient rocket engines allowed them to *barely* be possible, you can even say that they arrive at their special Railgun Launch Assist docking ports running on fumes, their main job is just to get stuff down, so it doesn't make much of a difference.""

*Scramjets? My translator chip is saying that its a type of hypersonic jet engine, but they can't reach orbit velocities... can they?*

""How much time would it save if we were to take that option?""

""Ehm... the heavy cargo shuttles are usually 2 to 3 times faster than the tether climbers, it varies on the pilot aboard and whether or not they refueled on the docking ports to get down faster.""

I looked the rest of the crew that was with me, who had been paying attention to my conversation with Nikolai. Some of them showed signs of wanting to go with the offer that Nikolai had brought up.

""...Alright, we will do that, anything's better than spending a long time without having nothing to do.""

""Ok, I will get in contact with a shuttle pilot that's willing to take the job and see if the higher-ups will approve of it, which they most likely will, I will return to you in an hour at most.""

""See you later, then.""

I then ended the call.

""Alright crew, lets prep our ship so that it can sit idle without anyone onboard, because it will have to stay behind.""

============================================================

\[Time skip: 4 hours\]

*\[27 hours until Operation Void Whisper\]*

***Memory Transcription Subject: Vyly, Commander of the third Venlil Scouting and Self Defense Fleet.*** 

Before I knew it, we had arrived at the Space Elevator.

The other people aboard our ship couldn't find words to describe their astonishment, looking down and seeing a structure that only ended on the surface of a planet, *from geostationary orbit*, was something that you would never see in the Federation.

The docking procedure went by surprisingly quick, and before I knew it, we were leaving our ship to meet with Nikolai, but by the look of things, I was the only one that wasn't nervous.

""Why are you guys so tense? Didn't I already told you that they're friendly?"" I muttered out to them, but they still weren't apparently convinced.

""Sir, see this from our point of view, we were trained to *kill* predators, and now we just got ordered to *train* alongside a bunch of them, why do you think we are nervous?""

""You were present on my ship when we first met with the captain of one of their scout vessels not long ago, why get nervous now, too?""

""We could've easily called for help back then, or at least have put up a fight if needed, but here? If they decide to do something, *we are dead*.""

""Back then they could've *easily* killed us too if they wanted to you wool brain! *Didn't you see the size of those* *ships?* They are bigger than any ship we currently have on our Space Force!""

""...Fair point.""

""Good, so shut your mouth *and do not offend them.""* I spoke back at him while moving to open the airlock, Nikolai was already there, waiting for us, baring his teeth in the now *somewhat* familiar 'happy' expression.

""Hello there! Nice meeting you face to face, Vyly.""

I gave him a tail flick, ""Hello Nikolai, nice meeting you face to face."" I then offered him my paw, which he quickly shook for a brief moment.

""Alright, this is the best boarding squad of my fleet, Vryt, Roldn, Vasti, and Zenyl.""

Only Roldn offered a brief tail flick in acknowledgement, the rest stayed silent.

""Don't mind them, they're just nervous of being here for the first time.""

""Oh it's okay, I totally understand, even more when they're working with a species that goes agaisnt everything they ever learned about in their lives ."" He waved one of his hands in the air for a brief moment, ""anyway, follow me, the higher-ups agreed to your request, the shuttle is waiting for us, do note that the seatbelts were made with humans in mind, they might not work with you.""

I looked back at my colleagues, some had their ears flat agaisnt their skulls, only Roldn was somewhat calm. I gestured to them to follow Nikolai with my tail, which they reluctantly did, pulling behind them their equipment.

Well, their opinion on the humans quickly changed as we moved through the Space Elevator's internal area, they quickly went from being suspicious and apprehensive to curious and awestruck.

I think that seeing many humans doing 'normal' activities, such as eating on a cafeteria, training on a internal gym, cleaning, guards patrolling the halls and other things was what showed them that our newest allies weren't that different from us.

After a few *minutes* of walking, we arrived at our destination.

""I'm going to accompany you all the way down to the airport, but after that, another ambassador called Noah is going to be taking up my place, I hope you guys are okay with that.""

I flicked my ears, ""not a problem, don't worry about that.""

""Great, oh! One more thing, if you guys need to use the bathroom or something, you might want to do that now, the shuttle's bathroom is kinda uncomfortable and the vacuuming mechanism it uses to work in micro gravity might not work with the amount of wool you guys have.""

No one spoke up, so Nikolai shrugged.

""Well then, follow me, let's board, the shuttle will depart in less than an hour, and until we get you guys strapped up to the seats it's going to be a while.""

We did as he asked, but not before Vryt sent me an apprehensive look.

The heavy cargo shuttle that we were about to board had a delta wing design, fully dark in color except for a few white lines, barely larger than our own ship. After navigating its inner hallways and storing our things on the passenger cargo compartment, we eventually arrived at the passenger section, it was quite simple, the windows were small, the seats only had minimal padding and no tail holes, as expected.

""I think you guys won't like the seats much, they weren't made with Venlil in mind."" Nikolai commented before choosing his own seat.

""Nah, we are used to the lack of comfort, when you're expected to just get the job done, aesthetics and how the crew feels usually gets put aside."" Roldn quickly answered while moving to one of the seats, his tail weirdly moved to one of the sides in a clearly uncomfortable position, but he didn't seem to care, ""Brahk, how do we connect the seatbelts?""

""Like this."" Nikolais promptly demonstrated by strapping on his own seatbelt, pulling one of the sides and clicking it into place on the other.

*Heh, seems easy.*

It wasn't.

Turns out that *accidentally* connecting two pieces of metal with some of your wool between them without noticing and them trying to move hurts, *a lot*.

I yelped before fixing mistake, though that didn't stop my colleagues from laughing, a bunch of whistling made that clear. Nikolai also laughed a little before regaining his composure.

After the little incident, things went by smoothly, and before I knew it, the ship was in the process of undocking.

""Attention all passengers, please have your seatbelts on at all times, the artificial gravity generator will be deactivated in approximately 3 *minutes*."" A voice echoed through the cabin.

Lo and behold, everything became weightless not long after the warning, but only for a brief moment, before long, we got pressed against our seats, indicating that the engines of what Nikolai had called an 'SSTO' had lit up to life. And apparently, they were *powerful*, I could barely move against the seat, that lasted a few dozen minutes, but by the time the engines turned off, we were far enough away to be able to see the whole upper part of the Space Elevator.

*Lets see how fast we can get down to the surface...*

I have a question regarding my itinerary. **I will go to the Netherlands and Belgium in Autumn.**

We are a young couple looking for a vacation, going to do *both chill and some fun activities* as well. We have 7 whole days, arriving in Amsterdam on the first night and leaving from Brussels Zaventem. *We also plan to rent a bike* since we like outdoor sports and we're used to training. We aim to be in the center so we can go to coffee shops or the red light district anytime, it isn't our most favourite activity, but we will definitely try. We don't need to pack all of our days--at least while in Amsterdam, since we also try to chill.

This is my planned itinerary:

* \*- Day 0: Arrive at midnight to the hotel and get some sleep to start at dawn.
* Day 1: Walk through Amsterdam, do a free walking tour, go to some coffee shops and stuff.
* Day 2: Go to Zaanse Schans using a bike.
* Day 3: Vondelpark (or any that you might recommend) and Magic ~~shrooms~~ Stuff -- get some pints after.
* Day 4: Rotterdam/Eindhoven.
* Day 5: Free day to do whatever. Last night on Amsterdam.
* Day 6: Go to brussels at midday, then go to our hotel in Ghent at dusk and enjoy the night in the city.
* Day 7: Brugges and Ghent. Last night.
* Day 8: Leaving at midday, so taking the train to Zavendem in the morning.

What do you think? We don't want to spend a lot of time in Brussels since I know the place and I'm more eager to visit Brugges and Ghent. We don't want to be moving from place to place every day, hence we aim to only use Amsterdam and Ghent as a base.

I (30F) met my partner (37M) five years ago, at the time my son (7M) was 2 years old. I had my own place at the time and my bf moved in to grow our relationship and help me financially so I could avoid moving. We had a great relationship at first but over the years our differences have made a huge impact on the relationship. There’s many difficult factors beyond those differences. But I’ll name the top 3

1. Some of his family have strong religious values. They are not supportive over us living together before marriage, they are not happy that I am not religious (neither is he) and I strongly suspect they have a major issue with him being a stepfather. His mother particularly is disrespectful and just awful to be around. Most of the family is actually awesome and love me, but the ones who make it difficult I can’t stand. 

2. Our 7 year age gap creates a void between us. When we met he had already been at his (government) job about 7 years, had money saved up, a newer vehicle and basically all his shit together. I worked at a coffee shop when we met, was a single mom and was nowhere near the same spot in life. I’ve felt like I’m playing catch up the last 5 years. He has a degree and a good job, I had neither. When it came to him wanting to buy a house I couldn’t contribute to a down payment, I wasn’t there in life. I’ve felt guilt about not being on his level basically the whole relationship.

3. He has made no attempt to pursue marriage. He claims he has always had this fear of marriage. As if buying a house or creating a human life isn’t as big or even bigger of a commitment. So the family judging us on not being falls on him, yet he struggles with their judgement towards our situation. 

Well we still bought a house almost 3 years ago. When we first moved in he dangled the idea of having a baby randomly on my birthday one year. We “tried” one time and he quickly decided he wasn’t ready after all. We just celebrated a 5 year anniversary (can’t even say celebrated because he passed over it like it was nothing) Right before our anniversary we went on a vacation and I unexpectedly got pregnant. Since then the stress has been intense. I had just started a new job that showed promise, but when my new bosses found out I was pregnant it was clear they were not happy their business investment had been compromised. The job turned toxic, I left. In the midst of all this it has been non stop arguing between me and my partner. I feel like they want me to have a career, an image, be this amazing partner and mother, just be EVERYTHING. The pressure is causing me to crack from the inside out. I feel constant anxiety and depression. Then today I realized; I just don’t want to do this. I don’t want to ruin my body. I have a child already. I want to go back to school, I want to have a career, I had plans to travel to Colombia and get my dream teeth (my biggest goal in life) It feels like my life is just at a standstill. Everything will go on hold for me to have this baby and I don’t even feel the love or respect I want from the person I’m having it with. 

I hemorrhaged after giving birth to my son and nearly died, so that has given me even more anxiety. I may leave behind a child I already have that needs me. 

I was so happy when we first found out and now I just have dread. I don’t want to go to another ultrasound because it’s going to feel more real. 

There’s a part of me that hopes this feeling will pass and it’s hormonal or just stress. Another part of me knows I’m looking at the logic dead in the face whether my emotions change or not. 

So now I feel nothing but guilt that while I feel love for this baby I just don’t want to start over, risk my life, and then put my life on hold. I feel like I’m the lowest of the low. Just looking for input, advice or even other stories… If you’ve read all this thank you! ",3,1756330783.0,whatdoIdo,5,1.0,False
1n1tzeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/amex/comments/1n1tzeq/making_a_case_for_the_business_gold_over_the/,Making a case for the business Gold over the personal Gold (YMMV),"YMMV, but for me the business Gold makes a lot more sense.

First and foremost, the biggest factor is I’m currently in pop-up jail for the personal Gold card. But even if I weren’t, it’s pretty easy to justify the business Gold for my individual situation. 

Making a case for the business Gold:

* The credits are easier to use. We live near New York City, so all of the coupons are fairly organic with the personal card. I’m not a huge fan of Dunkin’ Donuts, but I do drink coffee, so while that’s the least valuable credit to me, I’d still figure out a way to use it. With that said, the personal Gold requires you to keep track of a lot of things, whereas the business card I just have to stop by Staples once a month and make a purchase of paper towels or something else and I’m all set. The Walmart+ credit (and in turn Paramount+) is set it and forget it. We value this second credit may be a little higher than others, there’s a lot of trickle down, including gas discount. 

* More options for the 4X rewards categories. Dining/eating out is our biggest regular expense, and while we do spend a decent amount on groceries, some of that is at Costco. Also, we actually spend more on transit than groceries, in the form of ez pass, parking, and trains. I currently have the blue cash every day, so one idea I have is to upgrade to the preferred and then put my groceries/gas spending on that.

* The 175,000 MR points! Even if I weren’t in pop-up jail, there’s a chance I would only be eligible for a 60,000 point offer with the personal card. That’s about a third of the business card total! I’m one month in to working on the sign-up bonus and we have been able to spend over $6000 pretty easily without having to include rent. A few big dinners with friends where I covered, and they paid me back, and a large chunk gets taken out of the total.

I definitely like that dining on the personal card applies to international spend, it’s kind of annoying that the business card doesn’t have this same feature. But we have the C1 duo, which is what we put most of our spend on during vacations/business trips. 

Originally, I figured the business Gold was going to be a churn and burn, but now I’m considering it as a keeper card, especially because it covers a category (transportation) that I can’t get any higher than 2X on any of my other cards.

Am I the only one that finds the business card more valuable? It’s possible that I will close it out and open the personal card one day, either once I get out of pop-up jail or my player two could just sign up. But for now I am totally fine with staying put!

I didn't start using caffeine until I was in my 20's. I would occasionally have a caffeinated drink here and there, but it wouldn't really affect me too much when I was younger.

I've suffered through anxiety and depression my whole life, and caffeine helped me pull through the day for most of my 20s.

Unfortunately I had a very traumatic event take place at the end of my 20's, and my ability to cope with my anxiety lessened, despite being on antidepressants.  
  
Between that event and the endless stress that has built in my life in the past 3 years, I found myself relying on caffeine even more.   
I needed it to get through the work day, to motivate me to do anything at all, to keep me from feeling the guilt that went along with genuinely needing mental and emotional rest.

Sometime within the past two weeks, I had a really bad health scare. I've been using caffeine to keep me from staying still long enough to think about what was going on. A lot of this came to a head this past weekend when I had a huge cup of coffee, cleaned my entire house like an addict on a hit of meth, and then collapsed emotionally and physically into an exhausted mess. I had guests over that evening, woke up the next day exhausted, then went and got an iced latte because I was meeting with friends again that evening and GOD FORBID I FEEL TIRED! 

I've been using caffeine to energize myself, push myself way too hard physically and emotionally (I have ADHD so a lot of tasks take more energy for me than most people), and then I would collapse. Do that plenty of times over the span of a few months, and what happens next isn't much of a surprise...

After doing this a few times, I became completely emotionally numb. My brain was desperate for rest. I'm in therapy, and one of the things I've learned is that once your brain has taken too much stress, it shuts your emotions down until it believes you're in a place to handle them. 

Today I decided I'm done with all of this. I got good news about my health issues, and things are looking better. I am going to take this chance to try and improve things for myself so that I can enjoy the chance I've been given.

As far as caffeine goes, I've been weaning down this week. Black tea is still too much for my nervous system to take, and today I've had an 8-oz cup of white peach tea with honey. This seems to relax me instead of getting me all jazzed. I'm hoping that I can stick to this, because I genuinely have NOT been feeling good and I want to end this dependence for good.",1,1756330356.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1n1tord,https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1n1tord/civ_7_exploration_age_economic_path_overhaul/,Civ 7 Exploration Age Economic Path Overhaul,"**-What this Overhaul Seeks to Fix**  


* Adding strategy beyond getting settlements on distant lands
* Allowing for non coastal civs to prosper
* Making the Distant Lands more of a bonus than a requirement
* Reducing settlement clutter by not requiring 1 resource towns to win
* Making this age's victory more in line with the one before and after it.

**-Fix #1: Buildings with Purpose**  
It’s rare that I find myself doing much to improve my distant lands settlements because once you have all the treasure resources in its area worked there really isn’t much more you need to do with it as it will passively grant you Treasure Convoys.  


* Warehouse buildings will now reduce the time to grant Treasure Convoys to the improvements they affect, -10% for Tier 1 Warehouse buildings and -20% for Tier 2.
* Certain buildings will grant movement speed bonuses to Treasure Convoys
   * Settlements with Fishing Quays will grant their produced Convoys +1 movement on water and Shipyards will provide them +2.
   * Buildings and Improvements that provide Gold as a base yield will also refresh the movement of Convoys once per turn.

**-Fix #2: Recategorizing Treasure Resources**  
While I think the idea of your people valuing foreign resources is very interesting, the concept kind of falls apart when Gold from one island is deemed a treasure while another isn’t.  


* Resources will now be split into different categories beyond Homeland and Distant Land Treasures.
   * Local Treasures: Resources on your home continent. Provide 1 Victory Point from their Convoys.
   * Foreign Treasures: Resources from your starting landmass but not continent. Provide 2 Victory Points from their Convoys.
   * Distant Land Treasures: Only spawn in the Distant Lands. Provide 3 Victory Points from Convoys.
      * The best way to do this in my opinion is to have certain resources have a regional reskin. Asia might have Coffee but South America will have Coca Leaves. Or Asia might have Jade while North America has Green Obsidian.
   * Universal Treasures: Spawn across the map and provide equal amounts of points regardless of where they're found or who finds them. Provides 3 Victory Points from their Convoys.
* While I know the amount of points seems like a lot I would at least double the amount of Points needed for a Victory given there will be more ways to maximize your gameplay and acquire said points.

**-Fix #3: Resource Trading**  
While this age primarily ties itself to the European age of exploration I think it’s important for gameplay variety as well as painting things with more nuance to show the ways nations accumulated their wealth.  


* Sending a trade route to a settlement with a Treasure Resource will grant you Treasure Points at half the amount. as if they were within your own territory
   * This will reward players for maintaining friendly relationships or push them into conflict if they’ve burned enough bridges with those that hold onto valuable resources.
* Having closed borders with this Civ will cap movement of treasure convoys at 2 per turn and will not allow you to make use of their movement enhancing building

**-Fix #4: Town Specialization Integration**  
Much like the integration of buildings into this system I think Town Specializations can also do the same.  


* Farming and Mining Towns will provide a 10% increase to Convoy production based on the improvements they affect. This will increase to 20% if the town has 3 or more of the same Improvement being worked.
   * For example if your settlement is working a gems resource its Convoy spawn rate will increase with 3 other mines in the settlement.
* Trade Outposts will increase the rate at which nearby trade routes to players your trading with produce treasure fleets by 10% and will replenish movement like a gold building.

**-Fix #5: Treasure Resource Centered Policy Cards**  
The game could use more nuanced policy cards in general so this is my attempt at brainstorming some ideas.  


* Pilgrimage: Unlocks at Reformation. Distant Land Towns with the Holy Site Promotion have a 10% increased spawn rate for Treasure Resources.
* Export Economy: Unlocks at Mercantilism. Convoy Production modifiers in your own settlements are increased by 25%. Earn Convoys from trade 50% slower.
* Charter Colonies: Unlocks at Sovereignty. The Convoy Production rate is increased by 10% in Trade Outposts. Trade Outposts can’t be converted into Cities while this Card is active and produce 25% less gold.
* Privateers: Unlocks at Sovereignty. Naval units can capture convoys without going to war. Still generates grievances. Capturing convoys while not at war only generates half the points.",9,1756330012.0,civ,1,0.91,False

There were a few, the most notable being the cards at the coffee shop, but what I didn't notice the first time I watched it was that there was another test. A test that exposed Light before he even gave an answer for the cards. A test that was conducted in a single line of dialogue.

I am talking about L saying that he had to sit the way he did, because otherwise, his deductive reasoning would be decreased by 40%.

You may be thinking ""How was that a test?""

The answer? L is clever.

All that he said about the deductive reasoning may be entirely nonsense, he may just enjoy sitting that way. I think he told Light that to see if he would mimick the position.

See, if Light were truly not Kira, he would prioritise trying to solve the case, right? And surely that would mean looking a bit strange for the sake of a 66.7% boost in deductive reasoning (a difference which is by no means negligible).

If Light were Kira, not only would he be more concerned about his public image, but he would likely not want to put 166.7% of his brainpower into solving the case, because that would mean his capture.

I think that this was another test L gave Light, which he didn't just fail, but failed miserably. The card test could be excused as Light simply not thinking hard enough, but this shows an insight to his mindset, rather than his deductive reasoning.

Could this be why L was always so sure Light was Kira?",0,1756329848.0,deathnote,3,0.4,False

Hello friends! I’m 29, she/her, based in CST, and I’m currently on the lookout for some roleplay partners who are as excited about storytelling as I am. I’ve been writing for 10-15 years and honestly, RP is my favorite way to escape into new worlds. I’m hoping to find someone for long-term to create the kind of story that makes you daydream about your characters when you’re supposed to be doing real-life things ~~like folding laundry or answering emails~~. 

Here’s a little about my style:
- Advanced lit/novella writer. I usually write between 2–8+ paragraphs depending on the scene.
- I love weaving in description, atmosphere, and dialogue, but I’ll happily match my partner’s length/energy if that’s the vibe.
- **OCs only**. While I don’t mind exploring in worlds from other fandoms, I do not care for  canon roleplay. 
- My favorite settings are full of adventure, fantasy, magic, whimsy, and renaissance-inspired details.
- I ***love*** world building: creating lore, making maps, expanding on magic systems,  discussing theories on **taverns that mysteriously keep running out of ale**… all of it.


Here’s what I’m looking for in a partner:

- You must be 21+. This is non-negotiable. 
- Someone active who posts a couple of replies daily (or close-to-daily) would make me *swoon*. 
- No one-liners, please. I love depth, dialogue, and characters that actually go places and do things.
- Typos? **Totally fine**. But I do appreciate some level of literacy and readability.
- Characters with personality, quirks, and flaws. ***Please*** no Mary Sue characters. If your OC is a flawless half-angel-warrior-mage-princess, we might struggle to get along.
- Someone who enjoys plotting and bouncing ideas back and forth as much as I do. *Seriously*, I ***live*** for those late-night “what if we added *THIS* twist” conversations.

Some plots I’d be excited to dive into (but I’m super open to brainstorming together):
- Beast tamer x beast hunter
- Fae x adventurer
- Dragon keeper x dragon slayer
- Anything involving magical beings: witches, cursed royalty, shapeshifters, necromancers, enchanted forests, mysterious ruins, talking animals (give me all the whimsy and weirdness).

A little about me as a partner:
	
- I’m the type who will send mood boards, playlists, and maps if I get excited about a story.
- Love both heavy plot arcs *and* quiet character moments.
- Tropes I adore: found family, unlikely allies, enemies-to-reluctant-partners, cursed objects, secret identities, and a healthy dose of mystery.
- I will 100% get attached to side characters.
- My sense of humor sneaks into writing sometimes. This is your warning. 

If you’ve made it this far without running away, then we might become best friends! Feel free to DM me with a little about yourself, your writing style, and what kind of stories make you excited to write. I’m also more than happy to provide writing samples if you’d like to see what I have to offer before we dive in. Let’s build something wonderful!

Thanks for reading my novel of a post! May your coffee stay warm, your dice roll high, and your characters always surprise you. ✨

1n1ti9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1n1ti9k/hey_im_the_guy/,hey im the guy ...,"whats up players , 

im a prominent antifascist activist , journalist , artist , scientist and public figure now , apparently . 

this notoriety i have stumbled into is rather odd , and has come as a bit of a surprise , but im navigating this new terrain , crossing each new bridge as i come to it . Some of you may have noticed suspicious police activity over the last few days , since ive gotten back into town , and some of you may have seen me around . a few people who dont like me have recognized me and shouted derogatory things , flipped me off , etc , and some people have also hollered ""i like your songs! "" or subtle encouragements , left me cigarettes , MJ , food coffee or a few dollars here and there , which , small kind gestures like this really mean to me , more than you know . Thank You !

im sure it is plainly obvious that i am homeless , but what may not be obvious is that this is thru no fault of my own . this situation is entirely due to the attacks i have been enduring , which come mainly from a fascist biker gang that has beef with me . they are known as ""the sons of silence"" and a lot of law enforcement is members . 

some of the high ranking members are based in colorado , where i sometimes work , spend time , and have active cases . this gang , which actively engages in violent acts , drug dealing and human traffikkking / prostitution , they really dont like my existence , and are doing the most , when they could just be cool . they have both my workvans , my jeep , my truck , my camper trailer , my ebike , all my landscape and construction tools and they are guarding all this stuff , with guns , on the private property of one of their members in colorado , and they own the local police there , who have ignored all my reports of the thefts / crimes . 

on top of taking all my stuff , and sabotaging my business and my reputation , this gang is also trying to drown me in frivolous court matters , accusing me of doing things everyone knows i didnt do , being things everyone knows i am not , slandering me in all sorts of cruel ways and messing with me however they can . bc of this , i endured numerous police interactions and detentions and i was in jail in boulder CO for a month , arrested for smoking a cigarette in a park , given no bail option , no lawyer , no jury trial , no opportunity to contact the outside world , and was abused in many ways while i was detained , but i wrote some letters to the attorney general and civil rights lawyers and i was released from that institution for the criminally insane . this occurred bc i proved undeniably , beyond any doubt that i am physically and mentally stable , and grounded in reality , not a danger to my self or anyone else , so they had to let me go . 

This infuriated the gang , who came after me with even more vigor . I fled colorado , and returned to California where i live . when i arrived , i was promptly arrested in Santa Cruz , where the sons of silence gang also has a large presence . the cop said he didnt like the way i was walking my bike and he claimed to think i was talking ""weird"" when i said ""i need a lawyer"" . they let me go after only a few hours tho , bc the whole interaction was so blatantly fraudulent , that they had to . i am however being surveilled and stalked relentlessly still . ive requested official witness protections , but have been ignored . none of my attackers have been brought to justice yet , though they are known , and my stuff has not been returned . 

i think i have supporters here who want me to stay alive , but im currently a refugee . I contacted Gov. Gavin Newsom to request political asylum , because it is possible colorado may request extradition , but have not yet heard back from him .. the fascists really do not want me to disclose info that my research has uncovered , or testify regarding the attacks i have endured , and they aim to silence me , but i have powerful virtuous allies with integrity who look out for and protect me , who have noticed many parallels between what im going thru , and the cointelpro activities , fed. infiltration of AIM , and occupy walstreet movement , etc. so these supporters of truth choose to stand with me in solidarity , bravely , even though doing so publicly and in the open , comes with some dangers by association . bullies dont like me , and they dont like people who help me , or people on my team . ive been marked a ""person of interest"" ...

One of the notable reasons for this is specifically a Davis thing . Some of you may recall when Clayton Bigsby , the black white supremacist came to UCD last year , also known as Stephen Davis , host of the nazi television program ""campus crashers"" . im the guy who kicked the show off of the quad using direct action , by echoing what students present were saying , with added emphasis . there are some elements to this incident that most people might not be privy to but it seemed like many were talking about it when it occurred . this and other anti bullying actions ive taken have attracted backlash from the fash . 

i think there was some posts about me and my actions on this subreddit but i didnt read what people were saying about me . i just have a general sense that most people view me favorably and appreciate my work and only a small minority support the authoritarian regime that is attacking me . my street name is sylus but my legal name on my id , given to me by the foster care / adoption people is different .

if anyone reading this is willing to do me one giant favor which is free and takes only a few seconds , i would like to request that you follow this link (  [https://www.gov.ca.gov/contact/](https://www.gov.ca.gov/contact/)  ) to contact the governor and make a general request in support of my right to exist or select the ""clemency-pardon"" topic and write or paste in something along the lines of

 "" i request that David Vermont be granted clemency , pardon and political asylum in california and that he be permitted to live and work freely , unobstructed , and protected from unwarranted searches and interferences , because it is known to all that the accusations being made against him are fraudulent , frivolous and fabricated . ""

there are some other things too that arent too expensive or time consuming that people who are on my team can do , if people feel called to reach out and want to support things im working on , but for right now , im starting by making this quick post , introducing myself and opening up the conversation , to see if any supportive people would like to comment or get in touch with me , bc it seems like some people are interested in learning more about whats going on . if u made it this far , thanks for taking the time to look over my post . Be well and i wish you all the best",0,1756329596.0,UCDavis,9,0.2,False

1n1thhi,https://i.redd.it/54jphh4fpmlf1.jpeg,Ghouls' Digestive/Nutrient Systems,"

I was thinking how would the ghouls' nutrient system would differ to humans, as it is obvious it does because they can't eat human food, etc. But in regards to things such as fiber and carbohydrates, which I believe is difficult to get from meat.



Since the human body is primarily made up of water and protein, one could assume ghouls do not need nutrients like fiber and carbs in the way humans need, while coffee gives a little fiber it's not nearly enough as compared to eating veggies, fruits, etc.



I guess a simple answer is that they replace fiber and carbohydrates with meat and how the ghoul body digests the meat, like they block out fiber sources that humans would typically eat like lettuce, etc, and take the human body meat and break it down to create some sort of nutrients that substitute the needs to fiber etc, like maybe how plants need water and sunlight instead of eating food?



It would be interesting if Ishida Sensei made some sort of explanation further explaining these concepts, as well as possibly their digestive systems. Since ghouls don't need to eat humans as frequent as humans have to eat meals, or I assume, their needs to go to the toilet would differ from the human as well no?



I might be misinformed and don't know of such resource that already exists where Ishida Sensei or a canon source explains these concepts, but I thought it was interesting to think about.",9,1756329547.0,TokyoGhoul,6,1.0,False

Knowing some people reported real and serious reactions I decided to start with two small chunks fried with my egg this morning. Honestly one of the grossest mushroom I’ve eaten. I could only finish about the size of my thumb. 

Here’s where it gets interesting and slightly concerning. I left my room for class and in about 30 minutes I feel WIRED.

I ate this around 10 am and it’s 4:00 pm and I still feel like I have 5 cups of coffee in me or something.

The persisting symptoms are heavy legs and lack of motivation. Things I thought yeah they're not bad I can handle them, but honestly it makes me just not want to do anything at all and I like to be busy so its starting to bother me now.

It's catch 22 really because if I drink water and get out the house for some excercise I feel better but I cant be bothered to do either of those things (instead I drink coffee like its air, work that one out - much more effort involved). 

Today and yesterday were the worst days of the week but Ive done barely anything. So tomorrow Im setting my alarm and going out for the day, hopefully that will have an impact. I will also be carrying my water bottle everywhere. 

Im not going to list symptoms again because it really is just heavy legs and motivation/desire to do things now. But this is honestly making me panic. Im starting to think that what if this is just normal? I dont know what normal feels like, I havent for 15 years. The last time I was completely drug free I was in high school and Im now im my 30s. So for all I know, this is it?

Im hoping someone can come and tell me that theres more, that at some point I will start to feel fresh and alive and have the desire, motivation and energy to do things.

Im being a bit of a negative nelly I know, its just exhausting, sure is a long ole process isnt it 😅  to be fair, I think up until Monday the week actually went well. If id have done this update on Sunday it would have had a much more positive vibe, just been a crap couple of days is all.

It's the same story whenever we go away with them. It is always left to my husband and I to organise the cooking and cleaning in whatever holiday rental we're in. Whenever we go to visit them, I always have to make sure I bring food and plenty of snacks because I know they won't have thought of us enough to do any shopping.

So far my 3 attempts have come out tasting just wrong. It tastes both sour & bitter and it seems to get worse each time somehow.

For my materials, I use a 32 oz mason jar and a filter bag. For the coffee, I've been using Bizzy Organic Smooth & Sweet coarse grounds. Each time, I measure out 75 g of coffee and 750 ml of water. I put the grounds in the filter bag, then put the bag inside the mason jar. I pour half the water over the grounds, agitate it with a chopstick so all the grounds are wet, and then pour the remaining water. I tie off the filter bag and seal the jar.

For my 1st attempt, I left it in the fridge for 24 hours. It wasn't very good by itself. Diluting with oatmilk and creamer made it drinkable, but I couldn't really taste the coffee at that point (I did 4 oz of cold brew, 4 oz of oatmilk, and 1-2 oz of creamer)

The 2nd attempt was left in the fridge for 14 hours, big difference. I don't know if it was under extracted or what, but it tasted bad no matter what I added: water, milk, creamer, simple syrup. I had 2 drinks that I made with 4 oz of cold brew, 4 oz of water, 2 oz of half & half, and 1.5 oz of syrup. Once again, the coffee taste just wasn't there at that point, and I just threw the rest out.

My 3rd attempt (just finished this one a couple hours ago) I steeped for 8 hours at room temp and 10 hours in the fridge. I tasted it after the 8 hour mark and it tasted off. I couldn't tell if it was sour or bitter, but I didn't mind the taste. I left it overnight in the fridge and tasted it again after 10 hours. The off-taste was a lot more potent and I couldn't even swallow the sip lol. I honestly think this was the worst batch somehow. 

If anyone could tell me what I'm doing wrong or if you have any recommendations, that would be great. I used to drink Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brews from Starbucks, but I swear it tasted different each time. Nowadays I get drinks from local coffee shops (Phin Smith has a very yummy Vanilla Cold Brew + others). I also prefer cold drinks.

Socialists live in first-order land. Here are some examples of the type of thought processes I often see:

> I don't like working. We're really good at producing stuff and the world doesn't *really* need my labor. Let's take from the rich so that I don't have to work.

> Wage labor sucks. I want to be part of the food production process and produce just enough for my own use. But the farms are *owned* by people. That's not fair! We should all own the farms so that we can just work on them whenever we want.

> Gee, my rent is getting pretty expensive. We should make laws so that it can't go any higher so that I can afford rent.

> Gee, cost of living is getting pretty high but I'm on minimum wage. We should raise minimum wage so that I can afford to eat.

> Gee, I broke my arm but healthcare is pretty expensive. We should make the government pay for it so that I don't have to worry about it.

There's no malice in any of this, just no thought about ""and then what?"" or ""what happens if everyone thinks this way?"". It's all symptom management and no thought about underlying causes or side effects.

Really struggled the first 2 years making friends but eventually I got there. Just started my senior year and I really feel like I’ve done it. Yesterday I had a class and I wasn’t sure if I was going to know anyone and actually two close friends came in and sat next to me. Then went to my other class with people in my major and knew most in that class. 

Then I went and sat outside doing homework and an old friend came and sat by me and we had a great conversation about our senior year. Then I went to a coffee shop to read a bit and ran into a friend there, where we talked about how her roommate had made a decline in mental health and how we wanted to help her. 

Then I went home for a bit and my friend from freshman year picked me up and we went to a Muay Thai Class together, something I got him into a while back and regularly do together. Reconnected with a lot of the other students in that class. 

Went home and showered and a friend of mine that has graduated was in town, so I met him at the bar for a bit. He was the former president of a club that I had been working in for a while. He promoted me to president for this year. Met up with one of my fellow executives as well. 

Extremely gracious just to have friends and walk around a campus where people recognize my face. Big change from being alone for weeks on end freshman year. Not trying to brag about this just so happy about the position I’m in for this year. ",4,1756328507.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Palestino vs. Union La Calera: A Chilean Thriller Where the Odds Are as Tight as a Salsa Dancer’s Schedule**

The Chilean Primera División’s latest clash between **Palestino** and **Union La Calera** promises to be a statistical chess match, with bookmakers as divided as a couple arguing over the last slice of pizza. Let’s break down the numbers, sprinkle in some absurdity, and crown a winner before the match even kicks off.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams

The decimal odds tell a story of cautious optimism for Palestino, who sit at **2.3 to 2.45** (implied probability: **41-43%**) to win. Union La Calera, the underdog with a capital “U,” hovers around **2.9 to 3.0** (33-34% chance), while the draw is priced at **3.0 to 3.2** (31-34%). These numbers suggest a match where neither team can afford to nap—unless they’re Union La Calera, who might try anyway.

The spread bets add spice: Palestino is favored by **-0.25 goals**, meaning they’re expected to “just” avoid a loss, while Union La Calera (+0.25) gets a tiny lifeline. The over/under total goalsline is **2.0 to 2.25**, with under 2.5 goals favored. In other words, this could be as exciting as a spreadsheet audit—low-scoring, high-tension, and best enjoyed with a strong coffee.

---

### News Digest: Where’s the Fire?

Here’s the kicker: there’s *no recent news* about either Palestino or Union La Calera’s roster. No star players tripping over shoelaces. No managers quitting mid-game to become poets. Even the injuries mentioned in the text belong to Colo-Colo and Universidad de Chile, who are busy brooding over their Superclásico drama.

1n1syc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1n1syc7/my_holter_results_positive_now_what/,My Holter Results... Positive? Now What?,"Hi, here I am again. A week ago I had my first 24-hour Holter monitor with my cardiologist, and today I got the results.

1018 extrasystoles (EVs) over 24 hours. Many are due to movement or stressful moments (I never have problems at work, and I JUST had one that afternoon!) or the frustration of feeling those stinky chest pains. They go down when I sit or lie down.

I've seen the most when I arrive at work. There I had many in a row (150). But, in two hours immersed in my class (I'm a teacher), I only recorded between 20 and 50. Incredible!

Maximum heart rate: 107 (at work, where I haven't sat down for three hours).

Minimum heart rate: 51 (asleep).

Average: 75 (I always imagined it was higher!)

Cardiologist's report: monomorphic ventricular arrhythmia with a low beat density (1% or less). No complex patterns. Completely benign.

Does this give me relief? Today and yesterday I'm having around 800 extrasystoles, so no. I asked the cardiologist if I can do light exercise, and he said I can do any sport. I also asked if I can drink coffee or mate (I'm from Argentina and I need mate!), but he didn't answer. He just asked me to please address the psychological issue, since I attributed that to the root of the problem.

I really don't know what to think. When I move, I have tons of them. When I sit and lie down, I have few. On top of that, tomorrow I have to go for a walk with my students and I can't miss work. I'm terrified of having so many!

I'll have an appointment with a new psychologist next week. In the meantime... How do I keep from getting frustrated and scared? It's really annoying not being able to move without feeling dozens of those nasty things. 🫠",3,1756328330.0,PVCs,6,1.0,False

Since I picked up drawing over a year ago I've been a regular at my local coffee shop. I became so acquainted with the coffee shop that I began befriending the people who work there. I've invited them out to dinner and ran into them outside the coffee shop a couple of times. They're nice people, and I'm glad that I got out of my bubble and found some cool folks. 

I began developing a small crush on one of them who is a little less connected to the core friend group of the coffee shop. They treat each other like family and are best friends outside work (sleepovers, hangouts, etc) anyway, my poi is friends with them, but I don't see her hang out with them as much outside work.  The other day, I mustered up the courage to give my POI a small gift and a note telling her how much I appreciated her as a person and for being my friend despite her being at work. She really liked the gift and even texted me later on saying thank you for it. I originally wanted to say ""I like you,"" but I felt so awkward giving her the gift that I didn't say it and left shortly after giving it to her. I'm not really good at expressing my feelings without feeling embarrassed. I'm nervous of seeing her again, or if her coworkers know what I did, if they'd tease me about it, but I just feel stuck cuz where do I go from here? 

  
Because she's at work when I mainly see her I dont want to ""do too much"" even though they've expressed they like me and don't mind me, but still.... It's hard, and because I missed out on an opportunity to say ""I like you,"" it feels like my action was incomplete. The gift was sentimental, but I'm not even sure how she'd read my intentions. I'm going to take a few days to decide on what to do, but I also wouldn't mind some advice too.

1n1sy27,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1n1sy27/does_grove_co_laundry_detergent_sheets_deliver/,Does Grove Co. Laundry Detergent Sheets Deliver Powerful Cleaning Results Review?,"The product Grove Co. Laundry Detergent Sheets, Power Clean Dissolving Washer Sheets (2 Pack - 64 Loads) Tough Stain Remover, 100% Natural Lavender Blossom & Thyme Fragrance intrigued me from the moment I stumbled upon it. As someone who handles laundry daily and constantly seeks effective yet eco-conscious solutions, this product seemed to check all the right boxes. Compact, plant-based, and plastic-free? It sounded almost too good to be true. Curious, I decided to put it to the test and see how it stacks up against traditional liquid and powdered detergents.

**Eco-Friendly Design and Packaging**  
Sustainability plays a huge role in my purchasing decisions lately. These detergent sheets have completely eliminated plastic from their packaging, opting for fully recyclable paper instead. As someone who's desperately trying to curb household plastic waste, this feature gave me some serious eco-friendly brownie points. The sheets are thin yet robust, stored compactly, and don't take up much space in my laundry room—a huge win for organization enthusiasts. There's something oddly satisfying about not dealing with bulky jugs or powdery messes.

[Check Grove Co. Laundry Detergent Sheets price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0c4r2wktc/)

**Convenience and Ease of Use**  
Using these sheets couldn't be simpler. Each sheet is pre-measured, which eliminates the guesswork. My washing machine and I are well-acquainted with spillage disasters, so avoiding that was a delightful change. You just toss a sheet directly into the drum, along with the clothes, and let the washer do its thing. The sheets dissolve quickly and don't leave behind any floating remnants, whether in a high-efficiency front-loader or during handwashing. I even tried dissolving one in a basin during a recent handwashing session, and it melted away seamlessly in under two minutes. However, handling a sheet with damp hands, as I learned the hard way, can lead to it sticking where it shouldn’t!

**Fragrance and Ingredients**  
The lavender and thyme fragrance was an unexpected perk—I aim for natural scents rather than overly synthetic smells that seem to punch you in the face. The aroma was fresh, calming, and mildly floral without being overpowering. It's worth noting that the product uses plant-based cleansers and natural fragrances, with zero optical brighteners or dyes. Families looking for ""clean"" products or those with sensitive skin would likely appreciate this gentler alternative.

**Cleaning Performance**  
One word? Impressive. My first round of laundry included a mix of regular items and a particularly nasty coffee-stained white shirt (spilled it on myself at work during my third cup of Monday fuel). To my surprise, the sheet tackled the coffee stain remarkably well in one wash. Equally impressive was how it handled gym clothes; the sweat odors vanished completely. Still, for extremely stubborn stains, such as heavily set-in oil spills, they might need a little extra help from a pre-treatment product.

**Pluses**  
- Plastic-free packaging is a big win for sustainability.  
- Compact and travel-friendly.  
- Simple usage and quick dissolution.  
- Gentle lavender and thyme scent that isn’t overwhelming.  

**Hurdles**  
- It doesn’t always handle heavy-duty stains without additional work.  
- You need to avoid touching the sheets with wet hands—lesson learned!  

**How It Competes Against Other Laundry Detergents**  
In the grand landscape of laundry detergents, there are stiff competitors. Compared to traditional liquid detergents like Tide or Persil, these sheets score big in terms of eco-friendliness and portability. Liquid alternatives might edge out the sheets in tackling extra-stubborn stains, but they can’t match the sustainability factor of being dye-free, plastic-free, and shipped lighter. Against other eco-friendly brands like Seventh Generation pods or Tru Earth Eco-Strips, Grove Co.'s offering felt more straightforward: no complex packaging or pods to puncture. However, the cleaning performance leaned slightly more reliable than Tru Earth's, though I found Seventh Generation had a slight edge over Grove for large-scale family loads.

**True Value**  
For what these detergent sheets bring to the table—ease of use, reduced waste, and plant-based cleaning—I’d say they’re well worth adding to your laundry room arsenal. Of course, the price factor depends on what you're comparing it to, but for an eco-conscious, mess-free solution, these sheets make a reasonable and responsible investment. They might not entirely replace your go-to heavy-duty detergent for specific needs, but they certainly offer a solid, everyday cleaning option.

That's it. I'm done. Cold turkey.

I've been drinking tons of water and any time I get a craving I've been doing 10 push ups.

I turn 30 in a month and I would like to say I left vaping in my 20s.

I (F45) recently married my husband (M32). I’ve always been very friendly and warm with people, especially at work, since I’m a counselor/therapist. I’ve never had second intentions, just natural friendliness.

There’s a coworker (M38) I’ve known for a few years. We only work together twice a year at events, and we occasionally communicate by email/text for work. He’s married with kids, and I’ve known he’s gone through some tough times (wife’s health issues, family struggles). Like I would with anyone, I offered support in a professional, friendly way.

Earlier this year, things shifted. On March 5th, he invited me out for coffee — I didn’t respond, told my secretary, and we laughed it off. On March 27th, he texted me saying he was having problems with his wife and asked me to go for a beer Friday night. I declined and screenshotted it to my secretary as “evidence.” But I also realized I’d been talking with him more than usual that month, mostly just trying to be kind.

After I declined, he texted me “I missed you” and later said he would make sure to find excuses to see me more. I found it uncomfortable. I didn’t meet him in person and sent the screenshots to my secretary again.

Here’s where things went wrong: I usually delete all my text messages (even with my husband, work, or kids — I just don’t like keeping them). My husband accidentally discovered my conversation with my secretary about this man, and it made him suspicious. He confronted me, texted the coworker to back off, and asked me not to delete messages anymore.

My husband then checked our phone bill and saw that I exchanged over 500 messages with this coworker in March. He sees this as proof of an “emotional affair.” To me, it was never romantic — I had no feelings for this man, but I see now that it looks very bad.

My husband told me to report the coworker to HR, and I did. He also wanted to contact the coworker’s wife, but I told him no.

Now my husband says I’ve broken his trust and insists it was an emotional affair. I don’t know how to fix this. I love my husband and want to prove to him that nothing romantic ever happened.

1n1sujb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAllergies/comments/1n1sujb/im_so_scared_had_first_anaphylaxis_last_week/,I’m so scared. Had first anaphylaxis last week.,"The Monday before last, I was served regular flatbread indtead of cauliflower. My tummy hurt shortly after meal, and by the time I got to hotel (I was traveling for business) I realized I needed to go to the ER.  I had been eating gluten free for 6 or so weeks because it causes gastroparesis (GI suggestion). ER gave me stuff, said I had allergic reaction.

The next day another reaction and ER visit, and I abandoned my work trip.  This had never happened in my life. I saw an allergist that run bloodwork tests and all came back negative for allergy.

Today, I got coffee and a gluten free pastry and told the barista I had a wheat allergy. I started to react again, but this time an hour or so after I finished.  I had to use an EpiPen (my first time) and go to ER. I’ve been here 4 hours, and I started to have a second reaction. The doctor said he couldn’t tell a difference in my face and lips or tongue, but I felt it (size increase and hot and tingly). He gave me more Benadryl.

I feel insane. I feel like I’m imagining things. Any tips or insight? I’m so scared.

1n1srwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BaatonKeBhoot/comments/1n1srwd/nohkalikai_real_experience_from_shillong_ep3/,Nohkalikai real experience from Shillong (Ep3),"Meri ek jaan ne wali hai, Meera, Delhi University mei history student hua krti thi, apni summer internship ke silsile mein Shillong aayi thi.

Hum dono ki tarah, Meera bhi local folklore aur legends mein bhi khaas dilchaspi rakhti thi. Nohkalikai Falls ki kahani, ek maa ke dard ki kahani, usne kai baar suni thi –

ek project ke dauran bhi aur local guides se bhi.

Uske mann mein ek gehri udaasi thi iss jagah ko lekar.

Woh bhoot-pret mein vishwas nahi karti thi,

lekin phir bhi, uss jagah ki ek gravitas thi, ek bhaaripan.

Ek chutti wale din, Meera apni roommate ke saath Nohkalikai pahunchi.

Din ka time tha, dhup khili hui thi, aur waterfall ki tez awaz kaano mein ek madhur sangeet si lag rahi thi.

Meera ne apni notebook nikali aur kuch points likhne lagi – the geological formation, the tourist footfall, aur haan, the melancholic legend.

Woh bas ek researcher thi, apne mann mein kahani aur vaastavikta ko jod rahi thi.

Uska iraada koi paranormal activity ko invite karna nahi tha; woh sirf mehsus karna chahti thi uss jagah ka mahaul.

Jaise-jaise dopahar dhalti gayi, aur log kam hone lage, ek ajeeb si shanti chaane lagi.

Dhup ki garmi kam ho gayi, aur hawa mein ek thandi nammi si ghulne lagi.

Meera ne dekha ki baaki tourist jaldi-jaldi nikal rahe hain, shayad shaam hone se pehle wapas pahunchne ki jaldi thi unhe.

Meera thodi der aur ruk gayi, uss akeli shanti ko observe karne ke liye.

Uske mann mein Ka Likai ki kahani goonj rahi thi – pati ka dhokha, bachhe ka annt, maa ka pagalpan.

Usne apne aap ko samjhaya ki yeh sab uske dimag ki upaj hai, kahani sunne ka asar.

Tabhi, usne ek ajeeb si awaz suni.

Pehle toh laga ki hawa ki siskari hai, ya waterfall ke hi koi anokhe swar.

Lekin phir woh awaaz thodi aur distinct hui – ek gehri saans, jaise koi zor se rona rok raha ho.

Meera ka gala sookh gaya.

Usne idhar-udhar dekha. Koi nahi tha.

Sirf woh, aur waterfall.

Uski roommate toh pehle hi ja chuki thi, kahin dur coffee shop mein uska intezaar kar rahi thi. Yeh awaaz sirf usse hi sunai de rahi thi.

Jyun-jyun andhera badh raha tha, kohra aur ghana hota ja raha tha.

Meera ko laga ki uss kohre mein koi hai,

usse dekh raha hai.

Uski aankhen baar-baar waterfall ke uss khaas hisse ki taraf ja rahi thi jahan se Ka Likai ne chhalang lagayi thi.

Usse ek pal ke liye laga ki usne ek parchhai dekhi, jo paani ke girne ke sath hi gayab ho gayi. Ek thandak uski reedh ki haddi mein utar gayi.

Yeh dar uss dar se alag tha jo usne horror films mein mehsus kiya tha.

Yeh zyada personal tha,

zyada real,

kyunki uske dimag mein uss legend ki harr detail maujood tha.

Uski saansein tez ho gayi.

Woh nahi janti thi ki kya ho raha hai, lekin uske pre-conceived notions uske dimaag par haavi ho rahe the. Har sarakti hui patto ki awaz, har paani ki boond jo uske chehre par giri, usse jaise Ka Likai ki siski ya uske aansoo lagne lage.

Woh apni research, apni analytical thinking bhool chuki thi. Ab woh sirf ek insaan thi jo ek purani, dard bhari kahani ke saamne khadi thi, aur uss kahani ki vibrations usse ghere hue thi.

Meera ne apna samaan uthaya, aur bina piche dekhe, tez kadmon se wahan se nikal gayi. 

Usne apne aap ko samjhaya ki yeh sirf uske dimag ka khel tha, uski overactive imagination, jise uss kahani ne aur aag de di thi.

Lekin uss raat, aur uske baad bhi kai raaton tak, jab bhi usne aankhen band ki, usse woh siskiyan aur woh parchhai dikhti thi, jise usne Nohkalikai ke kohre mein dekha tha.

University ki kitaabon ne use shaq karna sikhaya tha, lekin Ka Likai ki kahani ne usse yeh sikhaya ki kuch baatein aisi hoti hain, jinhe sirf mehsoos kiya ja sakta hai, samjha ya smjhaya nahi.

Do you believe this story?

Kabhi aapke saath kuch aisa hua?

1n1srtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1n1srtm/how_does_the_gagaya_sl61_sliding_tray_perform_for/,How does the GAGAYA SL61 sliding tray perform for kitchen organization review?,"The GAGAYA SL61 Handy Sliding Tray is a product I didn’t know I needed until I started using it daily. Catering to those wanting countertop organization for coffee makers, blenders, toasters, air fryers, and more, this sliding tray held its own during my weeks of testing. Though small in size, it truly is a game-changer in handling bulky kitchen appliances without breaking a sweat. There’s a lot to love about this little gadget, but a few quirks need mentioning for a fair assessment. The focus here is on how it balances convenience with practicality.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the sleek matte black finish screams modern minimalism, which blends flawlessly with most kitchen aesthetics. Measuring 8.9''D x 1.2''W x 12''H and weighing just around 1.17 pounds, the tray is surprisingly sturdy for its compact design. Its build handles up to 30lbs of weight, so my hefty air fryer and blender didn’t even make the wheels flinch. Testing this day in and day out made me appreciate its simplicity—smooth-rolling wheels and the sliding mechanism work like magic, even with heavier appliances. Cleaning it is a breeze, thanks to the durable materials. However, I’d appreciate an option to lock the tray in place, especially during vigorous blending sessions!  

**Effortless Functionality**  
The ingenious sliding tray function is what stole the show. Sliding appliances in and out from under cabinets became a task I looked forward to instead of dreading. The mechanism feels seamless, requiring minimal effort, and the sturdy construction provided reassuring stability. Initially, I tried this tray under my coffee maker, and it became an instant morning-time hack. Throughout the testing phase, this handy solution made accessing commonly used appliances a lot less frustrating. My mom, who struggles with arthritis, gave it a thumbs up—it reduces the need to tug and lift heavy appliances unnecessarily.  

**See GAGAYA SL61 price on Amazon.**

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Durable construction supports up to 30lbs, making it versatile for various kitchen appliances.  
- Smooth, noise-free rolling wheels for an effortless sliding experience.  
- Simple, compact design with a matte finish complements modern kitchens.  
- Easy to maintain; a quick wipe-down restores its clean and fresh look.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Lack of a locking mechanism makes it less ideal for intense tasks like blending.  
- Sliding might not feel as stable on uneven countertops.  
- It doesn’t accommodate extra-wide or oversized appliances comfortably.  

**Target User Base**  
In my opinion, this product is perfect for anyone with a bustling kitchen countertop loaded with essentials like coffee machines, air fryers, food processors, or toasters. People living in smaller apartments, where counter space is at a premium, would value such an organizational tool. It’s also a boon for individuals facing mobility challenges as it requires little strength to operate. Families like mine, where mornings are chaotic, found it a much-needed upgrade to maximize efficiency during breakfast prep.  

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing this sliding tray to others in the same category, the stability and weight-handling stand out as major strengths. I tested a competing product that struggled with my air fryer, causing the wheels to jam, whereas this one slid effortlessly. The rolling mechanism here also feels superior—smooth and quiet. That said, some alternatives come with anti-slip or locking features, an edge this particular model lacks. Additionally, there are sliding trays with adjustable sizes, which can better accommodate unusually shaped or oversized appliances. While the GAGAYA SL61 excels in durability and ease of use, its limited size makes it slightly less versatile than some of its peers.  

**Smart Spending**  
Considering its features and comparison with similar products, this sliding tray ticks most of the boxes for its intended purpose. It offers an excellent mix of durability and convenience, outshining cheaper options you’d worry about breaking within a week. While it doesn’t match pricier alternatives in flexibility, its simplicity and straightforward focus on common kitchen appliance storage are where you see the value. For someone like me, often juggling breakfast prep chaos, it delivered more bang for the buck than expected.

1n1srmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1n1srmm/lpr_treatment_some_new_maybe_insights_from/,LPR Treatment : Some new (maybe) insights from scientific literature and blogs,"I am going thru a regimen to reduce my LPR symptoms with the final goal of not having them at all. My process started 5 weeks ago when I started having a lot of phlegm, clearing of throat, annoying cough and sore throat. No GERD symptoms although I am a long term GERD patient. But recently - 1 year ago- stopped taking PPIs.

I am a scientist myself and very curious about the causes and treatments of LPR. This site and you all folks helped a lot. 

I found a lot of literature and blogs about LPR from reputable sources and tried my best to analyze it. This post is about simple effective treatments.

1 LPR appears to be connected to the molecule Pepsin, an enzyme in the stomach that rises into the esophaegus  and the throat as a Gas .

2 Some literature says that Pepsin does not bind to the tissue in the esophaegus because of the thicker mucus layer there. But in the throat and nasal passages the mucus layer is quite thin, so Pepsin can attach to its tissue, causing all those symptoms.

3 Pepsin gets activated when we eat or drink acidic foods/fluids like coffee, citrus fruit. When activated the body reacts with mucus, Globus, etc.

4 So the goal is to not let Pepsin activate and / or neutralize it before acidic environment sets in

5 The easiest way to do this is either alkaline water (pH 8.5 and above) and or baking soda plus water. Some sites mention mixing baking soda wtih alkaline water.

6 You either spray it or gargle it. For nasal Pepsin, spraying is the option. 

7 Key Times to use these : Morning when Pepsin has accumalated during the night. ANYTIME before you eat or drink especially if those are acidic. One hour after all meals. Before bedtime.

8 They also mention sipping on Alkaline Water whenever you can. 

9 They mentioned not to use alkaline water with Phosphates in it.

10 An interesting treatment which is SUPPLEMENTAL to alkaline water is using edible oils like Coconut oil to coat the throat for a temporary relief.

11 Alginates are mentioned a lot. They seem to work by creating a Barrier in your stomach which prevents Pepsin gas from escapaing.. D Limonene may have the same effect. 

12 Diet of course is very important. Low acid diets, no caffeine, alcohol. Highly acidic fruits, spicey foods need to be avoided. 

13 Many sites mention that the reason Pepsin gets in your throat is the weak ELS you have. They also mention pepsin can get into the cells very easily.

14 How long does it take for all these to work? From Weeks to Months per the blogs. 

Most importantly these treatments are not the complete cure. But for many of us they help a lot.  

Hope this helps at least some of you.

No one in Gotham really blinks when something insane happens anymore. After all, this is the city where a mob boss dressed like a penguin once held the mayor's office hostage with an umbrella due to suffering a midlife crisis. A glowing twenty-foot Romanesque archway sprouting in the middle of 5th Avenue? Tuesday.  
  
But of course, a crowd had gathered, as Gotham crowds tend to do, half due to curiosity and half due to morbid desire to see something worth posting on social media before it got firebombed by the mayor.  
  
""Alright, so who do we think did it?"" asked one man in a denim jacket, slurping an iced coffee as though a stone interdimensional rift with runes didn't split his car in half. ""Place your bets. I'm saying Maxie Zeus.""  
  
A woman in a leather jacket scoffed. ""Maxie Zeus hasn't done Roman cosplay in years. He's Greek now and keeps ranting about Athena every time they drag him back to Arkham. This ain't him.""  
  
""It's a Gate. Rome. Rome is Latin. Latin is Zeus-adjacent,"" Denim Jacket insisted, gesturing dramatically at the shimmering portal.  
  
From the back, a man with thick glasses adjusted them with the seriousness of a professor forced to teach remedial history. ""Excuse me. This isn't Maxie. Look at the lettering. That's not classical Latin, it's some weird late Imperial mishmash with medieval flourishes. Whoever wrote it clearly had no grounding in-!""  
  
He didn't get to finish, because someone else shouted, ""Nerd!"" and threw a hot dog wrapper at him. Gotham's public discourse at work.  
  
Another voice chimed in: ""Could be Riddler. He loves this cryptic bullshit, right?""  
  
""No, no, Riddler would've slapped a giant question mark on it. Green neon. At least two crossword puzzles and a Sudoku.""  
  
""Scarecrow?""  
  
""Scarecrow doesn't do architecture after Harley Quinn posted his nudes on the internet.""  
  
""Ugh, don't remind me, okay then, hear me out it's the Joker, but he's having a Roman Emperor phase.""  
  
The crowd actually paused at that. Joker having a Roman Emperor phase was disturbingly plausible. Someone muttered: ""I mean, Caligula energy tracks…""  
  
But of course this didn't lead to a total agreement, and soon the argument swelled like a bar fight with no bar. Gothamites began splitting into factions, some insisting the Gate was a leftover League of Assassins project, others claiming it was one of Zatanna's stage props gone rogue, and one man swearing on his grandmother's grave that it was ""clearly"" a Wayne Enterprises tax write-off. He nearly got his ass kicked for disrespecting Brucie Wayne before he clarified that he meant some accountants and not the owner.  
  
Glasses Guy, still valiantly trying to be the voice of reason, shouted over the din: ""You people don't understand! I don't think this is Gotham villain work at all, it's otherworldly! Foreign! The inscription is practically a threat in classical military script!""  
  
Nobody listened. A teen with earbuds in was recording a TikTok while dancing in front of the Gate, much to the displeasure of the older people in the crowd.  
  
Then the roar came.  
  
It wasn't a Gotham roar. Gotham roars are distinct, usually belonging to escaped mutated zoo animals, Killer Croc, or very fast Batmobile or Batcycle or whatever. This roar was different. Almost thunderous, and distinctly scaly. The sound silenced the crowd in a way no cop siren or Arkham breakout ever could.  
  
The Gate thundered with sounds of footsteps almost like an army was marching, and out of it soared something out of every heavy metal album cover came a dragon. Bronze-scaled, wings outstretched, eyes glowing like molten coins. Its screech echoed off the skyscrapers. It was also ridden by some dude.  
  
Before the Gothamites could process that they heard a warhorn. Deep, resonant, rolling like thunder through the city streets.  
  
The crowd turned in unison to gape. For about half a second.  
  
Then, because this was Gotham, half of them immediately reached for their weapons.  
  
A middle-aged woman pulled a revolver out of her purse. A kid produced brass knuckles. Several men popped open baseball bats, as though they had been carrying them specifically for ""dragon emergencies."" More likely they were planning on robbing a place before getting distracted. One guy whipped out pepper spray.  
  
""Pepper spray?"" his friend asked.  
  
""What? Romans have eyes, don't they?""  
  
Another Gothamite, pulling out a crossbow from who-knows-where, muttered. ""Shoulda brought the elephant gun."" Before aiming his weapon into the gate.  
  
""Okay, so, uh… is the Batsignal on?"" asked a nervous mechanic holding a wrench he used to fix the traffic light an hour ago like a baseball bat.  
  
Everyone craned their necks to look. And sure enough, glowing against the clouds was the Bat-symbol.  
  
""Good,"" he muttered, gripping the wrench tighter. ""Aliens, Romans, whatever they oughta know Gotham's off-limits.""  
  
That drew a few cheers. Gothamites had pride. A weird, battered, Stockholm Syndrome pride. Outsiders might rob banks in Metropolis or invade New York, but everyone knew: Gotham eats invaders alive so you better conquer the rest of the planet first before using all of the army on Gotham.  
  
The dragon wheeled in the sky, its shadow casting over the streets. Behind it, armored soldiers with crested helmets and tower shields began charging through the Gate, spears raised, their horn echoing off skyscrapers.  
  
The crowd stared for a moment.  
  
Then the first voice shouted:  
  
""GET THE FUCK OUT OF GOTHAM ASSHOLES!!!""  
  
And just like that, Gotham charged back.  
  
The Romans must have expected panic. They expected civilians scattering, screaming, begging for mercy. They expected Gothamites to be like the soft-bellied peasants of their homeland.  
  
Instead, they were met with a hail of bullets, baseball bats, and pepper spray.  
  
The woman with the revolver fired off six shots, screaming, ""Go back to your museum!""  
  
The man with brass knuckles socked a legionary in the jaw hard enough to rattle his helmet.  
  
Somebody else broke a shield with a crowbar.  
  
Glasses Guy, who had been dismissed as a nerd minutes ago, surprised everyone by screaming ""FOR GOTHAM!"" and tackling a legionary like a linebacker.  
  
Chaos erupted.  
  
The dragon swooped low, jaws open, only to get pelted with rocks, bottles, and most humiliatingly a half-eaten hot dog. It roared again, confused. Gothamites roared back, hurling obscenities in three languages.  
  
One legionary raised his spear threateningly, only for a Gotham grandma to whack it out of his hands with her umbrella. ""Not in front of my bodega!"" she shouted.  
  
The Romans began to falter as they realized that these weren't peasants. These were lunatics.  
  
Somewhere in the city, the Dark Knight stirred. He didn't know what the Gate was yet, or why a dragon was circling his city. But he did know one thing.  
  
Whoever messed with his city would pay.

""I’m very new to moisturizer and sunscreen in general. I have, for many years, used Jergen’s body lotion, because as far as I’m concerned, since when is my face not part of my body?""

""A lot of people go, 'Oh, natural deodorant doesn’t work.' I agree. But you must trust the process. In the beginning, it makes you sweat almost more. It gets worse before it gets better. Give it time. Obviously don’t do this the first week on a new job. The timing of this is gonna be on you. But once it kicks in and it acclimates with your body, it’s incredible.""

""Much of being a lesbian is vibes. That said, I’m only now getting comfortable actually lighting and using my candles. A lot of us are victim to it. You get a nice candle for a birthday or something and you use it as a display item. You’re waiting for the right moment and find yourself waiting forever. Now I try to make most days special, and recognize that being home with my wife is always special, where we’re just chilling around the house or getting into bed. I do really encourage — which is easier said than done — that if you have a candle, light it. There’s a scarcity mind-set, but try and get over it.""

""If I’m not onstage or on-camera, I’m typically in a baseball hat. I don’t know at what point I started really wearing hats. I guess it was a sun thing, because it lines up pretty closely to when I moved to California full time. People always compliment my skin, and I think mostly that’s because I’m in a hat.""

1n1smhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1n1smhv/should_you_get_the_best_appliance_slider_kitchen/,Should You Get the Best Appliance Slider Kitchen Caddy ANBOXIT?,"I’ve had the opportunity to test the ANBOXIT Appliance Slider (model B0CJBW28P6) extensively, and it’s been a game-changer for my kitchen routine. This straightforward but brilliant wooden sliding tray has made handling heavy kitchen appliances such as coffee makers, air fryers, and blenders remarkably easy. At first glance, it might seem like a simple product, but once you use it regularly, it’s clear how much thought has been put into its design and functionality.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The combination of solid pine wood construction and the sleek black finish screams durability and elegance at the same time. It’s made to fit comfortably in a modern or rustic kitchen, complementing various kitchen aesthetics. Its dimensions of 15.5 x 12 x 1.69 inches are spot-on for most appliances, provided the base dimensions align. Unlike plastic or thin metal options, the sturdy wooden structure truly makes it stand out, especially when I tested its capacity to hold appliances weighing up to 80 pounds. It simply felt reliable, and there was no sign of wobbling, even with heavier items like a large stand mixer resting on it.

**Ease of Use**  
Using this sliding tray was surprisingly effortless. The hidden lever mechanism is a thoughtful touch. With just a light tap upward on the lever, even the heaviest appliances glided smoothly across my countertop. This design feature significantly reduced the effort required to move items, which, let’s face it, can sometimes feel like tugging a rock across sandpaper with other trays. And when not in use, the tray stays securely in place, thanks to the anti-slip mat underneath. This added stability reassured me that my expensive kitchen gadgets weren’t going anywhere unintended.

**Advantages**  
- It makes moving heavy appliances a breeze with minimal effort.  
- The high weight capacity of 80 pounds sets it apart from flimsier alternatives.  
- Soft plastic-coated wheels and silent bearings ensure smooth sliding without countertop scratches.  
- The anti-slip base keeps it firmly in position when not being operated.  
- The compact hidden lever saves space and prevents workspace obstructions.

[Check ANBOXIT B0CJBW28P6 price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0cjbw28p6/)

**Performance Under Pressure**  
I decided to put its strength and performance to the test by placing a heavy air fryer on it and creating a back-and-forth sliding motion. Impressively, the motion stayed smooth, regardless of the heavy appliance. No jerking, no awkward resistance—just seamless sliding every single time. The inclusion of silent bearings was a godsend here; it made the operation virtually noise-free. Anyone who’s used screws-on metal sliders can appreciate how annoying that creaking sound can get over time. ANBOXIT's tray completely avoided that irritation.

**Size and Compatibility**  
It’s essential to choose the right size to maximize its utility. The model I tested (wide version) fit perfectly for appliances with a bottom depth of 12 inches or less. However, the company also offers a deeper model for appliances between 12 to 15.5 inches in depth, which is great for those owning larger machines. The tray itself sits 1.7 inches high, and since this could matter if your cabinet clearance is limited, I suggest double-checking the available space before buying.

**Weaknesses**  
- One potential downside is that the tray doesn’t suit appliances deeper than 15.5 inches, which could be limiting for those with particularly capacious coffee makers or kitchen devices.  
- The wooden material, while aesthetically pleasing, may require periodic cleaning or maintenance to retain its look compared to plastic alternatives.  
- Make sure there’s enough vertical room in your cabinetry, as the additional tray height might be a deal-breaker for some layouts.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
If you’re exploring competitors, plastic-constructed sliding trays are an option. Brands like Nifty have less expensive models, but the plastic feels much less robust and struggles with heavier appliances over time. Bamboo trays, another alternative, often fail to match ANBOXIT when it comes to durability and smooth gliding. During my research, I found wood-based sliders generally had superior longevity and aesthetics, though they usually came at a slightly higher price point—ANBOXIT being no exception. That said, I prefer having the peace of mind that comes with the durability of a premium item.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
When considering the price for what the ANBOXIT Appliance Slider offers, I’d label it a smart choice for anyone looking to save their countertops from wear and conveniently manage heavy kitchen tools. Although it might be priced slightly higher than lightweight plastic variants, the benefits heavily outweigh the cost difference. Think about it as an investment in both efficiency and the safety of your kitchen setup. The seamless movement mechanics, scratch-proof sliding, and overall sturdy design make it worth every penny.

- **Cash/equivalents**: $39.3M (vs. $69.9M at 4/30/25)
- **Outstanding shares**: 106,685,160 as of August 20, 2025

**Segment Highlights (Q1 FY26 vs. Q1 FY25)**

- **U.S. Retail Coffee**: 
    - Net sales: $717.2M (↑15%)
    - Segment profit: $134.2M (↓22%)
    - Margin: 18.7% (vs. 27.7%)

    - Segment profit: $101.3M (↓12%)
- **Sweet Baked Snacks**: 
    - Net sales: $253.2M (↓24%, largely due to $52.8M divestiture impact)
    - Segment profit: $34.2M (↓54%)
- **International & Away From Home**:
    - Net sales: $290.2M (↑7%)
    - Segment profit: $65.5M (↑35%)
- Total international sales were $103.9M (5% of net sales).

**Divestitures & Restructuring**
- Sold certain Sweet Baked Snacks brands and the Voortman business in Q1.
- Announced closure plans for the Indianapolis, IN manufacturing facility in May 2025.
- Integration of Hostess Brands acquisition remains ongoing, with cumulative integration costs to date of $185.3M.

**Major Risks (Highlighted with Specific Evidence)**

1. **Commodity Price Volatility**: The quarter saw a sharp rise in commodity costs, demonstrated by a $227.7M loss on commodity derivatives (vs. $30.0M loss YoY) and a $253.1M negative impact reported as unallocated derivative losses, significantly reducing gross profit.

2. **Supply Chain/Inflation Pressures**: Management noted continued input cost inflation and supply chain disruptions. The gross margin erosion (from 37.5% to 22.5%) is attributed primarily to inflationary pressures (“higher commodity costs”).

3. **Integration & Acquisition Risks**: Integration of Hostess Brands is noted as ongoing, with risks related to achieving expected synergies, potential distraction of management, increased litigation costs, and negative share price impact (“our ability to successfully integrate Hostess Brands’ operations... the negative effects of the acquisition on the market price of our common shares”). Total integration and special project costs were significant in Q1.

4. **Legal and Regulatory**: The company continues to face class action lawsuits and contingencies relating to prior business sales (notably the Voortman contingency and Hostess Brands indemnification claims).

5. **Liquidity and Working Capital**: Negative operating cash flow was driven by higher inventory ($177.3M use of cash), increased collateral for derivatives, and rising short-term borrowings. Cash on hand decreased to $39.3M.

6. **Customer/Supplier Concentration**: The filing cites the concentration of certain businesses with key customers and suppliers as a risk, especially in light of supply chain disruptions.

7. **Foreign Currency/Interest Rate**: International sales and assets expose the company to FX rate volatility; 3% of net sales are subject to FX risk. The company has substantial debt and continues to monitor interest rate risk, with over $7 billion in long-term debt and a significant commercial paper program.

8. **Product Recall/Food Safety**: As a food manufacturer, product recalls, food security, and consumer perception remain ongoing risks (“disruptions or inefficiencies in our operations or supply chain, including any impact caused by product recalls…”).

9. **Execution of Price Increases**: The company’s ability to implement and realize price increases to match inflationary pressures remains uncertain and is cited as a potential risk.

**Management Discussion and Outlook**

- The quarter was dominated by a challenging cost environment as inflation and commodity prices pressured margins, especially given losses on derivative positions intended to hedge commodity risk.
- The business was also impacted by the integration of Hostess Brands and divestitures of underperforming units (Sweet Baked Snacks value brands, Voortman).
- While sales adjusted for divestitures were stable/improving in key segments (notably U.S. Retail Coffee), sharp drops in profit margins and net income raise caution.
- Management is focusing on supply chain optimization, managing special project costs, and closing underperforming facilities to restore profitability.
- “Broad-based supply chain disruptions and the impact of inflation remain uncertain. We will continue to evaluate the environment and adjust our plans as necessary.” 

**Liquidity & Capital Resources**

- Total debt increased due to higher short-term borrowing ($951.6M vs. $640.8M prior quarter).
- Net cash used in operating and investing activities resulted in lower cash balance, partially offset by new borrowings.
- The company remains in compliance with debt covenants, with adequate untapped credit facilities ($2.0B revolver).

**Conclusion for Investors**

The J.M. Smucker Company reported weaker profitability in Q1 FY26 due to sharp commodity market losses, rising input costs, and continued integration expenses from Hostess Brands. While underlying sales trends, after adjusting for divestitures, were modestly positive, significant margin contraction and negative operating cash flow are material concerns. Risks around continued cost inflation, execution of strategic initiatives, legal and integration challenges, and leverage should be closely monitored. Investors should expect near-term volatility until profit improvement initiatives take effect and commodity volatility subsides.

I pulled the spark plug from my Piaggio Typhoon 50 (2-stroke) and wanted to get some opinions on the plug reading.

- The plug is relatively new, maybe a few hundred kilometers.
- Fuel: regular 95 octane, premix oil is fresh.

From what I’ve read, the insulator should be kind of light brown / “coffee with milk” color if the mixture is right. Mine looks more grey/white on the ceramic with some darker deposits around the electrodes.

I’ve attached some close-up photos.
What do you think – does this look lean, normal, or is it an issue? Any advice appreciated.

It’s compact, sleek, and doesn’t scream “medical device,” which is a relief when you’re trying to keep your health monitoring low-key.

**Ease of Design and Comfort Pays Off**

This product gets points for its adjustable cuff—it fit my arm snugly without that pinching I’ve dealt with from older models. With a range catering to arms between 8.7 - 16.54 inches, it’s pretty inclusive. The material feels soft yet durable, so no awkward irritation during use. The lightweight design was unexpectedly good, making it easy to tote around in the included case. My cousin borrowed it once and praised how effortless it was to position for her elderly father, which highlights its user-friendly setup.

**User-Friendly Settings and Features**

Right off the bat, the high-definition LCD screen was a winner. Even my dad, who’s far from being tech-savvy, could make out his readings without squinting. The voice broadcasting took things up a notch. It practically guided my mom through her readings, while I could choose to mute it for early mornings. Plus, the memory storage feature came in clutch when tracking long-term progress for myself and measuring trends after adjusting my diet.

**Highlights**

- Adjustable arm cuff fits a range of sizes comfortably.

- Voice broadcasting adds accessibility, especially for older users.  
- Dual power options ensure flexibility wherever you need it.

There’s no such thing as perfection, and this monitor has its share of quirks. For instance, although the voice broadcasting is convenient, there’s no volume control option—and it can feel loud in quiet surroundings. I also found the memory storage a bit limiting since it doesn’t differentiate between users. Sharing the monitor with my family meant extra mental math to figure out whose readings belonged to whom.

- No volume adjustment for the voice announcement feature.  
- Memory storage can get muddled if used by multiple individuals.

**Product Rivals in Context**

While this device shines in accessibility, comparing it to premium models like Omron and Beurer highlighted a few differences. Omron’s cuff systems feel slightly more robust, and Beurer boasts smartphone app integration, allowing data syncing for tech-savvy individuals. That said, they come at a steeper price tag. If you’re not chasing app connectivity or extreme durability, Angel Wish’s monitor balances essential functionality with affordability. It’s also lighter and more portable, giving it an edge there.

**Worth Every Penny?**

For what it delivers, this monitor is reasonably priced. Balancing its features with cost-effectiveness, it provides excellent value for households looking to keep an eye on health without blowing the budget. Both the accuracy and straightforward usability make this device a solid pick even for those with minimal tech skills.

It reminds creators to use constraints like aspect ratio, seed, and negative prompts, then to iterate by varying only one element at a time so results are consistent. The guidance also covers safety and realism, encouraging users to declare when they want illustration, photo look, or stylized art, rather than leaving it vague. For everyday makers this reads like a practical recipe, it shortens the distance between a rough idea and a shareable image. Alongside those tips they are announcing nanobanana, a lightweight prompt companion that assembles prompts into neat sections and saves your best versions for reuse during campaigns. Expect simple templates for product shots, editorial sketchnotes, and infographic frames, plus a one click rewrite that swaps style or camera terms without breaking the core concept.

1n1s999,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n1s999,Build Diary 02,"The third day I was working on this project was 08.23.25. Looking back this was a bit of a frustrating day.   
I was started with messing around with the pcb placement. I was able to grab a pcb for the Pulsar Crazylight  model from [https://cults3d.com/:2812673](https://cults3d.com/:2812673) from a user known as Allisonmeows. I was pretty excited to get to use an off the shelf pcb and to use a model that was already created. For a lot of my work I try to use library parts as much as I can. This often means looking on Mcmastercarr to see if they have bolts, pvc, flanges, and a whole host of other random bits and bobs. They usually have what I'm looking for. It saves SO much time. 

I suppose I should have better outlined the goals I set for this project  
1. A new shape creation that I ""sculpted""  
2. Print the entire body and buttons as one piece  
3. Make it as light as possible. 

I'm no longer stuck to the idea of manufacturing my own design, at least at the moment so that meant I could design in a way that utilized all the benefits of 3D printing to it's full extent. This means not worrying about undercuts or how parts would come out of a mold. It means I can create ribs and braces inside shapes and print it all at once. The lightweight, unibody both tie together so nicely, which actually leads towards my next goal that I didn't officially make a goal. I wanted to model it as fast as possible. 

Last time I made a mouse it was for possible product that meant making it easy to change and update. That meant making it so it could be molded, and it meant making all the parts and files in a ""professional"" manner in the case that I needed to hand things off. There is a lot more detail I could go into exactly what this means but overall it just means more time modeling. This time I wanted to model irresponsibly. I wanted to be a vagrant. Ok that isn't exactly true. When I model, and want to model properly a lot of the times that means modeling top down. It means planning everything out and making a part with all my sketching done in that part. I can change the sketches and everything changes along with it. It tends to be a fairly robust way of modeling but it takes time to plan everything out that you want in your sketches. It prevents you from just extruding to this face or that component as a reference on the fly. I try to make as many relations as possible to sketch planes, points, etc. This time I'm not modeling top down. I'm thinking of how I want a feature to be made and then I'm making it. There is no master part. I wanted to see how much faster I could model this way but also if it would rid me of some of the anxiety I tend to get trying to solve and think about every little problem at once. I wanted to make modeling fast and fun. 

So far I've said a whole lot of nothing about what I did this day. So I got the model and had it placed into my shape. I took the crazylight mouse that I had bought for this project and took it apart. I noticed two things fairly quickly. The scroll wheel encoder was too low for my shape as was the square microswitch (makes sense they are always going to be relative to one another you clown). How do you solve that issue? You unsolder these switches and put on new ones that are the correct height. Ok I can do that....but if I raise the scroll wheel the scroll wheel diameter needs to be larger and upon sizing everything up in the model....it wasn't going to fit in the hole in the pcb for the scroll wheel. Funny thing is mice pcbs are meant to be used as is. they aren't made to have room to stick in bigger scroll wheels or wider scroll wheel supports or storing a cup of coffee (odd that one). 

This meant I had to use a different pcb. Siiiiiiiiiigh. Ok cool, totally happy with this development. What pcb was I going to use? Well I had a Pulsar Tenz and the shape is fairly similar to the one I was creating so everything should fit. I weighed all the components and it looked like the side button and main pcb would end up weighing 2 grams more than the crazylight. That's nothing I'll never be fighting for 2 grams (totally not foreshadowing). 

So with all that being said I modeled up the Pulsar Tenz pcb. I then modeled up the battery and the scroll wheel which didn't take any relative additional time because they are super simple models as one would imagine.

After I got all that done I was a bit inspired. I had thought I was going to start the day off where I was now at 3pm, even though I had started at 10am or so. I converted the basic shape to a more usable solid. I made a cutout for the usb-c port, made allocations for where I wanted the feet/mouse skates to go. I then cutout the M1/M2 basic shape and put in some support rods. The main goal was to make sure the pcb could be installed in the unibody design and kind of plan out where everything was headed. How it was all going to fit together and install as well as plan out the space in my head for everything else to go and what all needed to be added.",1,1756326660.0,u_MuffinmansStache,0,1.0,False

1n1s8lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1n1s8lf/i_built_a_cli_that_lets_multiple_claude_instances/,I built a CLI that lets multiple Claude instances have structured discussions and debates - the results are surprisingly good,"I've been working on Haino, a CLI-based multi-agent framework that lets you run multiple AI agents in parallel and have them actually discuss things with each other. Think of it as ""Claude vs Claude vs Claude"" but with a supervisor keeping things organized.

The idea came from a frustrating experience: I wanted to see what would happen if I opened three different AI CLI tools (Claude Code, Gemini, Codex) and had them review three different commits that were all solutions to the same problem. Each gave completely different conclusions, so I started copy-pasting their feedback between terminals until they reached some consensus.

The fascinating discovery? They were way more honest and critical when they thought the feedback was coming from another AI, not from me. Normally these models sugar-coat everything for humans, but when they think they're talking to a peer? Brutal honesty. 😅

That manual copy-paste process was tedious, so I built Haino to automate it properly.

The coolest feature is ""discuss mode"" - where agents can see each other's responses and build on them over multiple rounds. The supervisor (another Claude instance) analyzes each round and creates a final synthesis that's actually contextually aware of what type of discussion it was.

What makes this different from just asking Claude the same question multiple times:

* Multi-round discussions: Agents respond to each other's viewpoints
* Supervisor mediation: Keeps discussions focused and productive
* Context-aware synthesis: Knows if you're doing a code review vs brainstorming vs decision-making
* Customizable templates: You can configure how the final synthesis should be structured
* Built for developers: CLI-first, git-integrated, designed for actual work (not just AI experimentation)
* Actually honest feedback: No sugar-coating when AIs think they're talking to each other

I made a [`discussion-synthesis.md`](http://discussion-synthesis.md) template and added a bit funny sugar:

    # Discussion Synthesis Template
    
    You are synthesizing a {{roundCount}}-round discussion between AI agents.
    
    The original prompt was: ""{{originalPrompt}}""
    
    ## Discussion Evolution:
    
    {{discussionHistory}}
    
    ## Synthesis Instructions
    
    Please provide a comprehensive synthesis that directly addresses the original prompt. Tailor your response to what would be most useful given the context from the original prompt:
    
    - **For code reviews**: Highlight remaining issues that need addressing, categorize by severity, and provide actionable fixes
    - **For brainstorming**: Synthesize the best ideas, build on them, and identify the most promising directions  
    - **For decisions**: Provide clear recommendations with reasoning, pros/cons analysis, and next steps
    - **For analysis**: Present key findings, insights, and implications
    - **For problem-solving**: Identify root causes, evaluate proposed solutions, and recommend approaches
    
    ## Output Structure
    
    1. **Evolution of Thought**: How did viewpoints change across rounds?
    2. **Key Insights**: What valuable insights emerged from the discussion?
    3. **Areas of Convergence**: Where did agents find common ground?
    4. **Remaining Differences**: What important differences or concerns remain?
    5. **Actionable Recommendations**: Based on the full discussion, what should be done next?
    
    Focus on delivering value that directly serves the original prompt and the iterative discussion process.
    
    You **MUST** make sure that your synthesis is nerdy-funny and engaging to read, feel free to add emoticons and humor where appropriate.

      The discussion journey reads like a detective novel where everyone initially thought they witnessed a murder, only to discover the victim was actually getting a makeover.
      
      **Round 1: The Panic Phase** 😱
      - Agent 1: ""This is a strategic pivot!"" (optimistic but confused)
      - Agent 2: ""11,000 LINES DELETED! THE HORROR!"" (dramatic quantifier)
      - Agent 3: ""BUILD IS BROKEN! ABORT! ABORT!"" (the pragmatist)
      
      **Round 2: The ""Wait, Let Me Actually Look"" Phase** 🔍
      - Agent 1: *becomes the fact-checker supreme* ""Actually folks, let me count those files for you...""
      - Agent 2: *quietly adjusts glasses* ""Upon further review, perhaps I miscounted...""
      - Agent 3: ""Oh, 7805f5b isn't HEAD? Well, this changes everything!""
      
      The evolution from ""architectural apocalypse"" to ""architectural evolution"" is chef's kiss perfect. 👨‍🍳💋
      
      ## 2. Key Insights: What We Learned When We Stopped Panicking 💡
      
      1. **The Phantom Package Mystery** 👻: The `@haino/agent-adapters` package exists in a Schrödinger's state - referenced everywhere, supposedly deleted, but actually still there (just evolved). Classic case of ""reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.""
      
      2. **Feature Creep (The Good Kind)**: While everyone was mourning the ""deleted"" code, the codebase was actually getting superpowers:
         - Discussion consensus features (because who doesn't love a good AI debate?)
         - TUI enhancements (making terminals great again!)
         - Supervisor aggregators (someone needs to watch the watchers)
      
      3. **The Great Refactoring**: `agent-pool.ts` + `claude-agent.ts` → `adapter-service.ts` represents not simplification but *sophistication*. It's like watching two apartments merge into a penthouse. 🏢
      
      ## 3. Areas of Convergence: Where Everyone Eventually Agreed 🤝
      
      - **Yes, significant changes happened** (understatement of the year)
      - **Yes, the architecture evolved** (not devolved, despite initial fears)
      - **Yes, documentation got better** (miracles do happen!)
      - **Yes, that ""bak"" commit message is terrible** (unanimous verdict: commit message jail)
      
      ## 4. Remaining Differences: The Spicy Debates That Persist 🌶️
      
      1. **The Scale Question**: How many lines were actually deleted? 
         - Agent 2's ""11,000"" vs everyone else's ""not that many""
         - Someone needs to learn `git diff --stat` properly
      
      2. **The Philosophical Divide**: 
         - Is this a ""transitional state"" (Agent 1's hope)
         - Or ""architectural simplification"" (Agent 2's interpretation)
         - Or just ""broken and needs fixing NOW"" (Agent 3's urgency)
      
      ## 5. Actionable Recommendations: What Actually Needs Doing 📋
      
      ### 🔴 Critical (Fix Immediately):
      1. **Resolve the agent-adapters references**: Either fully remove all imports or ensure the package is properly available. This limbo state is unacceptable.
      2. **Fix that ""bak"" commit**: Squash it, reword it, or at least apologize for it in the next commit message
      
      ### 🟡 Important (Address Soon):
      1. **Build validation**: Run `yarn build` and actually fix what's broken (Agent 3 was right about this)
      2. **Document the architectural decisions**: Why did we refactor? What's the vision? A DECISION_RECORD.md would be nice
      3. **Test coverage for new features**: Those shiny new discussion features need tests
      
      ### 🟢 Nice to Have:
      1. **Performance benchmarks**: Did the refactoring improve anything measurable?
      2. **Migration guide**: For anyone who was using the old agent-pool pattern
      
      ## The Verdict: APPROVE... But With Trust Issues 🤔
      
      The changes represent genuine evolution and improvement, but like a teenager's room cleanup, we need to finish what we started. The codebase is in a better place architecturally, but it's currently wearing mismatched socks (those dangling imports).
      
      **Final wisdom**: Next time, maybe don't review ~40 commits in one go? Even AI agents need coffee breaks. ☕
      
      ---
      
      *P.S. - To the developer who wrote ""bak"" as a commit message: We need to talk. The git history remembers everything. Forever. 👀*
    
    Key Insights:
      • Discussion consensus features (because who doesn't love a good AI debate?)

      • **Yes, significant changes happened** (understatement of the year)

      • Or just ""broken and needs fixing NOW"" (Agent 3's urgency)



The framework is still evolving (it's built for my own development workflow), but I'm excited about the potential. There's something genuinely useful about having multiple AI perspectives duke it out and reach a synthesis - especially when they're not trying to be polite to you.

Next I'm working on specialized discussion types (security reviews, architecture decisions, etc.) and better integration with existing developer tools. The goal is to make this feel like having a really smart team that actually challenges you instead of just agreeing with everything you say.

Burning sensation in stomach / upper GI , used to only occur on consumption of beer, but in past week the sharp burning pain occurs with any food.

I’ve always had pain in my stomach and beer (which I don’t consume), was the primary trigger. Once or twice a year, a friend would encourage me to try their beer., (“oh you’ll like this one”), and instant burning pain in my stomach ensued.

As of about a week ago I’m now experiencing that pain no matter what I ingest. And I’m a light eater and I fast. Just had some rice and a few slices of cucumber for dinner and was in pain all night. Felt ok this morning but pain came back after a few sips of coffee. I’m pretty much already on an elimination diet because of the pain. But if I can’t even drink plain black coffee once a day, my quality of life is going to go downhill.

History:
- several occurrences of perforated diverticulitis that required hospitalization. (Although my current problem is upper GI pain).
- recurring DVT in leg, and I’ve been on Eliquis since 2016. 

I don’t require a lot of food and in the past ten years I exist mainly on black beans, eggs, and wheat toast since those never hurt me. But as of late, even my safe foods now cause sharp burning sensations in my stomach.

She goes as far as making our older kids stop doing what we expect or have asked them to do to do what she wants. Then when i correct my kids shs like “i just need then to do this for me” My husband addressed this and her solution was to do it when he’s not around. If I leave the room to go to the bathroom or something of the sort she “takes charge” and starts ordering my kids around. Or if we are all in the same room and my kids do some SHE doesn’t like or agree with she starts telling them to do this and that and don’t do this. Example, my toddler earned a treat from the treat box for using the potty. I handed her the box and said pick something. My mother in law rolls into the room as I’m standing there saying “did your mom give you that? Are you suppose to have that? I don’t think your parents want you having that stuff. Why don’t you put that away. Then tries to take it from her as I’m standing there and my daughter is starting to lose her marbles. I said “I’m right here, and if I thought she was doing anything inappropriate I personally would do something as I am her mom” my husband has addressed this with her too. And she “said I will not tolerate extremely bad behavior” and my kids are far from misbehaved or ill mannered. My husband sets boundaries and I feel as if they are completely dismissed. 

I don’t know how to go about this anymore. I feel like I’m not even feel like the mom anymore.",4,1756326364.0,SAHP,10,0.84,False
1n1s4np,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1n1s4np/the_silent_generation_please/,The Silent Generation? Please,"Boomers came across as kind, patient, and open. Some even carried a streak of rebellion while working in big corporations. They rarely lost their sense of self, even under the weight of big bosses and bigger egos.

Gen X, by contrast, doesn’t often speak directly about themselves. Their perspective shows up more clearly through their kids—Gen Z. And Gen Z has turned self-expression into performance. One of their favorite outlets? Critiquing and media-shaming millennials.

Millennials, however, tend not to react with the same intensity. They grew up through recessions, student debt, and the rise and fall of entire platforms. They were forced to piece together an identity out of shifting ground. Some of Gen Z’s trends are simply recycled versions of what millennials once did, now mixed with whatever the current “it” figure is promoting—whether that’s Pilates, iced coffee, or celebrity-driven brands. For men, the rise of figures like Andrew Tate (Yikes). 

Millennials often criticized boomers for having an economic golden spoon. Yet, despite less stability, they emerged independent, self-assured, and unafraid to stand up for themselves. That combination is precisely what makes them appear threatening to both Gen X and Gen Z.

The observation is this: like the boomers, millennials remain largely unchanged and unbothered, even while being labeled, criticized, and called “lazy.” And yet, they remain the generation everyone else can’t seem to stop talking about.",2,1756326361.0,workplace_bullying,1,0.75,False

1n1s2r3,https://www.reddit.com/r/gate/comments/1n1s2r3/gate_thus_gothamites_broke_some_legs_there/,GATE: Thus Gothamites Broke Some Legs There​ (Prologue),"No one in Gotham really blinks when something insane happens anymore. After all, this is the city where a mob boss dressed like a penguin once held the mayor's office hostage with an umbrella due to suffering a midlife crisis. A glowing twenty-foot Romanesque archway sprouting in the middle of 5th Avenue? Tuesday.  
  
But of course, a crowd had gathered, as Gotham crowds tend to do, half due to curiosity and half due to morbid desire to see something worth posting on social media before it got firebombed by the mayor.  
  
""Alright, so who do we think did it?"" asked one man in a denim jacket, slurping an iced coffee as though a stone interdimensional rift with runes didn't split his car in half. ""Place your bets. I'm saying Maxie Zeus.""  
  
A woman in a leather jacket scoffed. ""Maxie Zeus hasn't done Roman cosplay in years. He's Greek now and keeps ranting about Athena every time they drag him back to Arkham. This ain't him.""  
  
""It's a Gate. Rome. Rome is Latin. Latin is Zeus-adjacent,"" Denim Jacket insisted, gesturing dramatically at the shimmering portal.  
  
From the back, a man with thick glasses adjusted them with the seriousness of a professor forced to teach remedial history. ""Excuse me. This isn't Maxie. Look at the lettering. That's not classical Latin, it's some weird late Imperial mishmash with medieval flourishes. Whoever wrote it clearly had no grounding in-!""  
  
He didn't get to finish, because someone else shouted, ""Nerd!"" and threw a hot dog wrapper at him. Gotham's public discourse at work.  
  
Another voice chimed in: ""Could be Riddler. He loves this cryptic bullshit, right?""  
  
""No, no, Riddler would've slapped a giant question mark on it. Green neon. At least two crossword puzzles and a Sudoku.""  
  
""Scarecrow?""  
  
""Scarecrow doesn't do architecture after Harley Quinn posted his nudes on the internet.""  
  
""Ugh, don't remind me, okay then, hear me out it's the Joker, but he's having a Roman Emperor phase.""  
  
The crowd actually paused at that. Joker having a Roman Emperor phase was disturbingly plausible. Someone muttered: ""I mean, Caligula energy tracks…""  
  
But of course this didn't lead to a total agreement, and soon the argument swelled like a bar fight with no bar. Gothamites began splitting into factions, some insisting the Gate was a leftover League of Assassins project, others claiming it was one of Zatanna's stage props gone rogue, and one man swearing on his grandmother's grave that it was ""clearly"" a Wayne Enterprises tax write-off. He nearly got his ass kicked for disrespecting Brucie Wayne before he clarified that he meant some accountants and not the owner.  
  
Glasses Guy, still valiantly trying to be the voice of reason, shouted over the din: ""You people don't understand! I don't think this is Gotham villain work at all, it's otherworldly! Foreign! The inscription is practically a threat in classical military script!""  
  
Nobody listened. A teen with earbuds in was recording a TikTok while dancing in front of the Gate, much to the displeasure of the older people in the crowd.  
  
Then the roar came.  
  
It wasn't a Gotham roar. Gotham roars are distinct, usually belonging to escaped mutated zoo animals, Killer Croc, or very fast Batmobile or Batcycle or whatever. This roar was different. Almost thunderous, and distinctly scaly. The sound silenced the crowd in a way no cop siren or Arkham breakout ever could.  
  
The Gate thundered with sounds of footsteps almost like an army was marching, and out of it soared something out of every heavy metal album cover came a dragon. Bronze-scaled, wings outstretched, eyes glowing like molten coins. Its screech echoed off the skyscrapers. It was also ridden by some dude.  
  
Before the Gothamites could process that they heard a warhorn. Deep, resonant, rolling like thunder through the city streets.  
  
The crowd turned in unison to gape. For about half a second.  
  
Then, because this was Gotham, half of them immediately reached for their weapons.  
  
A middle-aged woman pulled a revolver out of her purse. A kid produced brass knuckles. Several men popped open baseball bats, as though they had been carrying them specifically for ""dragon emergencies."" More likely they were planning on robbing a place before getting distracted. One guy whipped out pepper spray.  
  
""Pepper spray?"" his friend asked.  
  
""What? Romans have eyes, don't they?""  
  
Another Gothamite, pulling out a crossbow from who-knows-where, muttered. ""Shoulda brought the elephant gun."" Before aiming his weapon into the gate.  
  
""Okay, so, uh… is the Batsignal on?"" asked a nervous mechanic holding a wrench he used to fix the traffic light an hour ago like a baseball bat.  
  
Everyone craned their necks to look. And sure enough, glowing against the clouds was the Bat-symbol.  
  
""Good,"" he muttered, gripping the wrench tighter. ""Aliens, Romans, whatever they oughta know Gotham's off-limits.""  
  
That drew a few cheers. Gothamites had pride. A weird, battered, Stockholm Syndrome pride. Outsiders might rob banks in Metropolis or invade New York, but everyone knew: Gotham eats invaders alive so you better conquer the rest of the planet first before using all of the army on Gotham.  
  
The dragon wheeled in the sky, its shadow casting over the streets. Behind it, armored soldiers with crested helmets and tower shields began charging through the Gate, spears raised, their horn echoing off skyscrapers.  
  
The crowd stared for a moment.  
  
Then the first voice shouted:  
  
""GET THE FUCK OUT OF GOTHAM ASSHOLES!!!""  
  
And just like that, Gotham charged back.  
  
The Romans must have expected panic. They expected civilians scattering, screaming, begging for mercy. They expected Gothamites to be like the soft-bellied peasants of their homeland.  
  
Instead, they were met with a hail of bullets, baseball bats, and pepper spray.  
  
The woman with the revolver fired off six shots, screaming, ""Go back to your museum!""  
  
The man with brass knuckles socked a legionary in the jaw hard enough to rattle his helmet.  
  
Somebody else broke a shield with a crowbar.  
  
Glasses Guy, who had been dismissed as a nerd minutes ago, surprised everyone by screaming ""FOR GOTHAM!"" and tackling a legionary like a linebacker.  
  
Chaos erupted.  
  
The dragon swooped low, jaws open, only to get pelted with rocks, bottles, and most humiliatingly a half-eaten hot dog. It roared again, confused. Gothamites roared back, hurling obscenities in three languages.  
  
One legionary raised his spear threateningly, only for a Gotham grandma to whack it out of his hands with her umbrella. ""Not in front of my bodega!"" she shouted.  
  
The Romans began to falter as they realized that these weren't peasants. These were lunatics.  
  
Somewhere in the city, the Dark Knight stirred. He didn't know what the Gate was yet, or why a dragon was circling his city. But he did know one thing.  
  
Whoever messed with his city would pay.

Recently, my girlfriend and I had an important conversation, though I wouldn’t call it an argument. It was more of a discussion that felt significant.
This past weekend, her family had an emergency— their air conditioning broke, and with the heatwave, they needed somewhere cooler to stay. I was more than happy to have them over for the weekend, and I told her they could stay as long as they needed.
The night they called, we had already planned to give each other massages to unwind from the stressful week, which would have been a chance for us to connect emotionally and physically. But, when her family called about the emergency, we obviously had to cancel our plans. To me, it wasn’t a big deal—emergencies happen, and I was happy to help. I even pitched in by cleaning up a bit, taking out the trash, and moving my car to make sure they could park nearby.

She stayed up to help her family, and I went to bed. I'm not sure when she came in, but it must’ve been pretty late—around 2 or 3 AM. By then, I was already asleep. When she came to bed, she woke me up, wanting my attention. I checked to make sure everything was okay, went to the bathroom, came back to bed, and fell asleep. In the morning, she mentioned that she felt anxious about the situation. I reassured her that I was just tired and that everything was fine.

The next day, her family was still with us. I made them coffee and suggested we order breakfast for everyone. We carried on with our day, and they didn’t leave until 8 PM, which was perfectly fine with me. I ended up taking a nap around 7:40 PM, and she said she was going to join me, but she ended up taking a nap in the living room instead.
On Monday, she told me I seemed distant, and I admitted that I did feel that way. I explained that I felt she hadn’t acknowledged our original plans for massages, and she didn’t make any effort to either apologize for canceling or reschedule. I also told her that waking me up in the middle of the night was inconsiderate, especially since in the past, when I’ve woken her up, she’s gotten upset.
I shared that when something comes up for me, like the concert I was invited to that Friday, I always try to reschedule or make up for it, as I did when I moved our dinner plans to Saturday. I explained that I just wanted some acknowledgment of our canceled plans and hoped we could make them happen later.

Her response was that she felt I was attacking her, questioning why her family was there, and that I should just expect our plans to be canceled. I reassured her that I wasn’t attacking her or her family. I was genuinely happy to help out, and I just wanted some acknowledgment of the change in our plans and a chance to reschedule.
She said her family emergency took priority, that she had too much going on, and later admitted she’d forgotten about the plans altogether. Throughout the conversation, I felt invalidated. It seemed like I was in the wrong for simply wanting some acknowledgment.

Eventually, after I told her I didn’t want to discuss it anymore because she wasn’t listening, she made more of an effort to hear me out. The issue, though, is that she tends to interrupt me when I’m talking, and it’s only when I tell her I don’t want to continue the conversation that she finally listens. It’s frustrating because it feels like I’m being ignored until I set a boundary, and by then, the moment feels lost.

My hairloss journey began about 8 years ago (see profile) after a coworker made a comment about my receding hairline. I was fixing my boss's computer while on a video call, and the guy (a bald man himself) made the comment, ""Wow boss, your forehead got bigger."" While I had noticed that I had to put on face moisturizer ""higher"" on my forehead, it hadn't occurred to me that my hairline was actually receding.

I procrastinated getting on finasteride for about a year thanks to a lot of paranoia on r/tressless, but once I got on it (at age 33), I felt like my hair loss stopped progressing. I planned to get a hair transplant, but I wasn't sure when/where. My wife was pregnant and wanted to plan a baby moon, and once she settled on Turkey as a destination, I decided it was finally time to pick a clinic and get the hair transplant. I researched on r/HairTransplants and r/tressless, and decided on Medblue Turkey and Dr. Turan after seeing a lot of positive reviews from seemingly-legitimate people.

I reached out to the clinic on Oct. 30 and got a reply from Zülal, who is kind of the swiss army knife of Medblue. She's a hair transplant expert, coordinator, translator, and basically your hair transplant liaison while you're going through the procedure. I sent her a lot of pictures, and I got quoted for 2,700 grafts using DHI with a split of 2000 FUE in the hairline and 700 DHI in the crown/midsection. I received three package options with different costs associated with them, and I chose the middle package which included four nights at a five-star hotel for 3,900 EUR. I paid a bit more to make the room double occupancy for my wife and to extend the stay to six nights. The transplant was scheduled for Nov. 20, and I sent a 200 EUR down payment to the clinic to reserve the date.

Transport to the hotel from the airport was easy thanks to a nice video that Zülal sent showing where to go. My wife and I had the next day to ourselves and went on a city tour, and Zülal sent me the pickup time at the hotel with instructions for the following morning. I was picked up at 7:25 and had the complimentary breakfast without coffee prior to pickup. If you're worried about looking weird at meals after surgery, don't be. Every breakfast had at least half a dozen guys with bandaged heads, and there were a number of women with fresh nose jobs too. I wore a button-down shirt as instructed, and the driver was on time. The ride to the clinic took about 45 minutes in traffic, and Zülal was waiting for me when I got off the shuttle.

The consultation was smooth, and I did not feel rushed in making decisions. My blood was drawn and analyzed, and they left a port for an IV to be used later. They commented that my hair actually looked better than the pictures suggested, so fewer grafts would be needed for the DHI. They shaved my head and noticed some dryness in my scalp and some low-level infection. Zülal sent pictures to the doctor to confirm there wouldn't be any issues, and they thoroughly scrubbed my scalp. and drew on the hairline. I was able to send pictures to my wife to get her commentary on it. Once my wife provided her input on the hairline and the doctor said my head was safe to proceed, we finished the consultation. I swapped my shirt for a hospital gown, and we began the extraction.

I was prepared for the shots to be a 10/10 on pain based on everything read on here, but I would rate the shots in donor area as a 7-8/10 for pain. I do have a somewhat higher pain tolerance, but it actually wasn't as bad as I was expecting. There are quite a few of them though. Once they ""connected the dots"" with incisions, they began the extraction process. I didn't find the extraction to be painful at all, though you do feel pressure. Near the end of the extraction, I started to lose numbness in the back-left area of my neck. I informed them that I was feeling some pain (maybe 5/10), and they asked if I was ok to proceed. Once I confirmed I was, they finished the extraction in that area but went ahead and gave me additional numbing injections after the extraction was complete before bandaging the back of my head. My one recommendation for this point would be to bring some kind of bite guard or mouth guard. When they're extracting from the back of your head, your face is just kind of mashed into a pillow, so I found myself wishing I had something so I wasn't gritting my teeth together or using my jaw to keep the teeth separated.

After getting bandaged up, it was time for the incisions. I was given time between and did use the restroom. They were very careful with me and advised me to move slowly and not to lock the door as a safety measure and sit on the toilet. After that, I went in to prep for the FUE incisions.

The injections for the next part are in the forehead, and they were more painful than the ones in the donor area. I would rate them an 8-9/10 for pain. The ones in the temple area were the worst. After that though, I felt absolutely nothing. The incisions took a while, and I was hooked up to an IV while receiving them. I actually lightly dozed off a couple times during the incisions.

Following the incisions, we took a break for lunch which was surprisingly good (I even included a picture in the gallery). I finished lunch, and we went back into the surgical room to begin the implantation process and perform the DHI process. This part was going to be an extended period on my back, so I made sure to put in an earbud so I could listen to some music. The FUE implantation itself did not hurt at all. Again, I lightly dozed off a couple times while the grafts were being implanted. I found myself counting them at points, then I decided to stop because I didn't need that level of OCD going through my head.

After the FUE injections, we began the DHI process. I did feel some pain during the DHI, but it wasn't bad. Since my DHI portion was substantially smaller than my FUE, it took less time.

After surgery, I was returned to the hotel with my medication and instructions. The medicine regimen was to start the next day, but I was told I could take a pain pill if I needed one at night. Once I made it back to the room, I slept almost immediately. The neck pillow they provide is inflatable, and it's definitely not comfortable. Zülal gave me a pad to put on top of the pillow to absorb any blood or ooze that came out, and that made it a bit more comfortable. If you've got your own neck pillow that's rigid so you won't roll over, I'd recommend it!

The night of the surgery, I noticed that I had some ""bubbles"" on top of my head with fluid build-up. When they picked me up to wash my head the next morning, they looked at it very carefully and drained it. During drainage, a graft popped out, and they popped it back in place. Zülal asked me to send her pictures if any more fluid sacks popped up on my head during the evening. One did, and I sent her pictures. She said they would take care of it during the wash the next morning and that it was not concerning.

The next morning, I got picked up to go to the hyperbaric chamber. I stupidly didn't listen when they said to bring a paper book/magazine (no electronic devices allowed), assuming they would have some kind of reading material in English there. I was mistaken. Further, they have a TV on in there (not sure how that works), but it's all in Turkish. To make matters worse, I have claustrophobia, so that combined with having no viable way to distract myself caused me to have a mild panic attack while in the hyperbaric chamber. Thankfully, they were able to let me out (after an anxiety-inducing couple of minutes to depressurize), and I just waited for the bus after that. The clinic refunded me for the second hyperbaric chamber session; however, if you can do it, you definitely should. I've been told they're miracle workers with speeding up the healing process.

During my second wash, they drained the bubble and said no grafts were dislodged this time. Even though my package only included two washes, they told me to please let them know the next morning if I had any fluid bubbles, and they would make an extra trip and bring me in to wash my head again. I really appreciated that. Thankfully, there weren't any bubbles after that point. I was given my 6-month post-op kit, Zülal texted me instructions on what to do, and I was sent on my way after recording a video for social media (not mandatory).

Fast forwarding to the 9 month mark, and I can't tell you enough how happy I am with this decision. I now have confidence to go out without toppik in my hair, something I haven't done in 9 years (though when I'm trying to look extra nice, I still put a couple sprays in). What's also interesting to me is that people have started commenting that I look younger than I am. I had some people say I looked 28-32. My boss even commented that most people with a new baby look tired, but I somehow look ""younger"" (his wording, and he didn't know about the hair transplant). It's such an amazing feeling to have confidence in my hair after stressing over it for nearly a decade.

Lets get right to the story, so pretty much my and our whole lives we've lived with my parents, my grandparents and my sister in a 3 room house (2 bedrooms and living room). Early 2020 we moved out in a 1 bedroom place me, my dad, my mom and my sister shortly before moving back again at the house where we lived due to my grandfather's death. Keep in mind my grandma lives there and we simply moved so she wouldnt be alone. I was 12 or 13 at the time and had to share a room with my grandma i had no choice so i started to literally force myself to adapt. My grandma is the type to wake up at 4AM or 5AM and then go to sleep again at 1pm or 2pm. At first, i didnt think much of it it didnt bother me yk but after a while it started making me mad. We started fighting alot and at night i couldnt sleep because of her loud snorring. 2023, October month my parents get a divorce. I chose to stay with my dad because of financial reasons and my mom had moved in a place thats only like a living room and there an upstairs room with only a bed, no privacy at all. I stayed with my dad (still am) because i finally thought it would get some space. Forgot to mention my dad works in Aviation and hes a professional driver so most of the time hes not at home. Shortly after my dad tells me that he has a girlfriend (whom he cheated on my mom for 3 years and she also has 3 kids and isnt legally divorced). I was like, okay, as long as he is happy i dont mind. First time meeting her was nice, we went on a trip for the weekend with my dad, her daughter and my sister because she had some work there and also my dad wanted to meet us with them (her daughter). The first few months were okay, they also started sleeping over (the youngest son is 8 years old, her middle daughter is 12 years old and her oldest daughter is 21 years old) but only the youngest son and her middle daughter as her older one had a life lol. After a while it got, annoying. She would sleep with my dad in his room, i would sleep with my grandma as usual, and her kids along with my sister in the living room. This went on for long (still does sometimes) and it started to bother me alot. I have told my dad multiple times and he still wont do anything about it. I began having an extreme attitude due to lack of privacy and overall extremely annoyed. This has been still going on. As i said im 14 now about to turn 15, i dont have a single bit of privacy. Since then i have been going on with my attitude because ive fallen into an depression (not deppression depression) ive been holding myself tight but it has become unbearable. My dad also always invites some family members over to sleep and doesnt even care about where i would sleep. Of course i always go at my moms i forgot to mention but the thing is i want some privacy at home. My dad also gets really mad at me for not spending time with her kids. Like, what the fuck am i supposed to do with a 8 year old as a 15 year old? Because of this, i have anger issues now, im constantly annoyed, i dont have privacy, im always angry and mad and i cant even bring a friend over. I dont know what the hell i should do.

EDIT; Forgot to mention also a few other things aswell as this situation is huge and very overwhelming. Im very close with my cousin (18F). We've been always hanging out, sleeping over because we are family lol and we are always together. She is literally the only one in my life right now if we are talking about friends or anything else. Everytime we hang out we sleep at my house and sometimes hers and she is the only one who knows about my situation at home. Ive spoke with alot of family members about this (my aunts, my step-uncle, etc) and all of them have agreed with me and what i think. Also, i dont even have privacy when im out with friends. I used to hangout with this guy and his friend and one time while we were out my dad literally FOLLOWED me with his girlfriend, embarassed the shit out of me and took me home and yelled at me. They've done this like 2 times now and i plan to mention it to them because what the absolute fuck? Also, a few days ago it was the middle daughters birthday. The kids have absolute no respect. Her middle daughter has diabetes since she was 4 and i think thats why my dads gf might be like that towards her but its no excuse anymore. THEY ARE SPOILED AF! Speaking of her birthday, her oldest daughter came with her boyfriend. We ate, talked, laughed... Before we left my dad asked his gf where her kids are gonna sleep. When he asks this questions i instantly get moody because for some reason we are always at our house. Also; this woman lives in a big ass house with a view, and 4 bedrooms for everyone. My dad asked me if i would be home to stay with her youngest and i couldnt even answer because of angerness. I told him that i would sleep at my moms house and he cursed the fuck out of me the whole ride home and just in general always calls me names yk what i mean. And the thing that made me furious, her oldest daughter lives with her boyfriend, i dont know how their home layout is but, her mom asked her if she would take her sister to sleepover for like atleast 2 nights and she literally refused. She (her oldest daughter) started talking about how she had private things to do and she named that she had to study and do ""private"" things. My dad also really doesnt let me have a normal social life as a GIRL and a TEENAGER. My whole life ive only ever hanged out with my cousin and her older friends. I also start high school on monday which im highly excited about considering ive picked a HS thats like 40 minutes by bus away from home and new people to meet. He always has to say some shit whenever im going out whether the theme is about money or who im going with. Like 2 days ago, me, my cousin and her friend were making plans to go eat Sushi. So like 3 hours earlier i tell my dad like hey dad me and (cousins name) are planning to go eat sushi. He started talking to me about how he is drowning in work and told me not live like i'm ""the presidents daughter."" The thing is, i dont have friends. This whole summer i literally stayed in. And if i spend money i spend like 3 euros for coffee and something to eat. This happened like 2 days ago and we dont even talk and when we talk we fight. Right now im at my moms house and when i came here i cried because of how misunderstood and unrespected i feel.

EDIT 2: Also forgot to mention my dads way of dealing with money? Last year he and his GF bought a house in our building and we have people renting it like an Airbnb. And now recently, in june, he told me that he bought a motorcycle (BMW F 750 GS) 12K EUROS!? And he complains to my mom whenever they talk about something that he has no money and he complains to me about that but yet live like a billionare with his gf. How is any of this fair? Im so mad, im so furious, im so sad, i literally wanna kill myself. Im so sorry for forgetting to include all of this stuff its alot and at the moment im too sad and angry and feel everything at once to type it out. ",1,1756325521.0,AITAH,10,0.57,False
