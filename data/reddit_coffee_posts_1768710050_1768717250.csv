1qg0w6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1qg0w6s/weight_loss_injections_and_work_stress_why_this/,Weight loss injections and work stress – why this combo feels tougher than expected,"This is something we see all the time, but people rarely connect the dots.

They start weight loss injections, things are going well, weight is coming off… then work ramps up. Deadlines, staffing issues, long hours, pressure, poor sleep. Suddenly the medication feels harder to tolerate, energy drops, nausea creeps in, or weight loss stalls.

It’s not that the injections have stopped working. It’s that stress changes how your body responds to everything.

Why work stress hits harder on weight loss injections

Stress already affects appetite, digestion, sleep, and hormones. Weight loss injections also affect appetite and digestion. When both are happening at once, the effects stack.

Here’s what’s usually going on.

Stress suppresses appetite in the short term  
When work is intense, people forget to eat. On injections, hunger signals are already muted, so it’s very easy to under-eat without realising.

Cortisol stays elevated  
Chronic work stress increases cortisol. High cortisol can slow weight loss, increase fatigue, worsen sleep, and increase water retention, which makes people think progress has stalled.

Sleep quality drops  
Late emails, early starts, poor switching-off. Poor sleep worsens nausea, fatigue, anxiety, and hunger regulation, even when calorie intake is low.

People rely more on caffeine  
More coffee, less water. Caffeine tolerance often drops on injections, so jitteriness, reflux, palpitations, or anxiety can appear.

Common things people notice during stressful periods at work

These are very typical comments we hear:

• “I’m losing weight but I feel exhausted”  
• “I feel nauseous when I try to eat at work”  
• “I forget to eat all day, then feel awful”  
• “My weight has stalled even though I’m barely eating”  
• “My anxiety is worse since work got hectic”

Most of the time, the medication hasn’t changed. The environment has.

Does work stress reduce how well injections work?

Indirectly, yes.

Stress doesn’t cancel the medication, but it can interfere with:

• Regular nutrition  
• Adequate protein intake  
• Hydration  
• Sleep quality  
• Consistency

If those slip, side effects feel worse and weight loss may slow or plateau temporarily.

This often leads people to think they need a higher dose, when what they actually need is better support around stress and routine.

Under-eating is a bigger problem than people realise

One of the biggest issues we see during stressful work periods is accidental under-eating.

People assume:  
“I’m stressed, I’m eating less, surely that helps weight loss.”

In reality, too little intake can cause:  
• Fatigue and brain fog  
• Dizziness  
• Nausea  
• Poor concentration  
• Muscle loss  
• Hormonal disruption

None of that supports sustainable weight loss.

Why nausea often shows up at work

Work stress activates the sympathetic nervous system. Add appetite suppression and slower gastric emptying, and suddenly eating feels uncomfortable.

People then stop eating during work hours altogether, which worsens things later.

Light, planned intake usually works better than waiting until hunger appears.

How we approach this at Keltoi

At Keltoi, we see weight loss injections as one part of a much bigger picture, especially for people in high-pressure jobs.

During periods of work stress, we focus on:

• Preventing under-eating rather than pushing restriction  
• Protecting protein intake  
• Adjusting dose titration if side effects flare  
• Timing injections away from peak stress days  
• Managing caffeine and hydration  
• Normalising short stalls during high-stress periods

We’re much more cautious about dose increases when someone is clearly under pressure at work.

Practical tips if work stress is high

What usually helps in real life:

• Eat something small and protein-based before work  
• Don’t rely on hunger cues alone  
• Keep simple snacks available  
• Drink water alongside caffeine  
• Avoid injecting right before major deadlines or long days  
• Accept that progress may slow temporarily

Trying to “power through” stress while eating very little often backfires.

When to check in with your clinician

If work stress coincides with:

• Persistent nausea  
• Ongoing dizziness  
• Severe fatigue  
• Anxiety or palpitations  
• A sudden stall that doesn’t resolve

It’s worth checking in. Often small adjustments make a big difference.

Final thoughts

Weight loss injections don’t exist in a vacuum. Work stress, sleep, routine, and mental load all matter.

If things feel harder during stressful periods at work, that doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong. It means your body is under more pressure.

The goal isn’t just weight loss at any cost. It’s weight loss that fits around real life, real jobs, and real stress.

If work is intense right now, support your body through it rather than asking it to cope with less and less fuel.",1,1768716870.0,KeltoiWellness,0,1.0,False

1qg0vgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1qg0vgo/i_wish_i_knew_less/,"""I wish I knew less.""","Striza prided herself on her knowledge of humanity. With how widespread they had become since joining the Federation, human studies has become a rather important subject to learn. Striza having graduated at the top of her class, was ready to flaunt her knowledge at this new academy.

John was an average student. He had a small circle of friends, only caused trouble in class once or twice, and was a solid B student. He was seated at his desk, drinking his morning coffee, a beverage that spread like wildfire through the Federation thanks to it's mind focusing capabilities, when Striza walked in.

The two locked eyes for a moment, at that was all it took. John choked on his coffee, and Striza saw her chance. By the time he had recovered, she had made her way up to his desk, loudly boasting each statement, showing off her knowledge set.

""Coughing from a human can be caused by several things. You show no symptoms, so sickness can be ruled out. Air quality is carefully controlled, so allergies can be ruled out as well. Conclusion, you were coughing due to unintended inhalation of your drink."" She spoke each sentence with enough ego to make a narcissist blush.

""Reasoning for such an action can vary as well, but given the timing of the event, you must have been surprised when you saw me. You have no doubt seen a variety of species since enrollment, so we can exclude seeing an extraterrestrial for the first time. And as we have never met before, you must be surprised by my personal appearance."" Her tone showing no sign of lowering.

She didn't even skip a beat before continuing. ""Humans often use facial expressions to convey emotions to one another. In this case blushing is used as a sign of attrac...."" She suddenly stopped mid sentence. She took a step back, realizing just how close she had gotten. Another fact had chosen to cross her mind, at the worst possible time. That humans are compatible with a disturbing number of species across the galaxy, hers included.

Quicker than she had gone up, she ran back down the rows of desks, and back out the door, passed a rather confused professor. The professor turned toward the direction she came, locking eyes with John. ""Now John, I know you, and I know bullying is beneath you, so what exactly just happened here."" Before John could speak, his obnoxious friend who had witnessed the whole thing, spoke up. ""I think John just got himself a girlfriend.""

The professor, who admittedly, knew very little about humans, blew this off as just another form of ""friend"". A term he actually was familiar with. ""Just so long as you talk things over after class."" The professor said, completely oblivious.

Striza, who hadn't even begun to calm down, was full on panicking now. She had prided herself on her knowledge of humans, but this, this was beyond her. ""What do human relationships even look like?"" She cried out. This sort of information wasn't widely taught, or even understood. Humans tended to keep their relationships private, and if her imagination, which was now running wild, were to be believed, quite intimate.

Just as she walked around the corner, there stood John. Striza should have expected this, humans were known to be terrifying persistence hunters capable of tracking their targets for miles.
""What kind of animal tracks down a desired mate?"" She thought to herself.

Just then, John reached behind him, Striza expecting some kind of weapon or trap, was surprised when he showed her her backpack, which she forgotten in the class, with her dorm room marked on the front, which, sure enough, was where he waited.

Striza, now less panicked, was about to speak, when John spoke first. ""You know, it's a bit rude to end a conversation without saying goodbye. Did they not teach you that?"" Striza, completely slipping back into her know it all side, retorted, ""There are various other ways of ending a conversation besides goodbye, such as ""so long"" or ""farewell"". Some cultures even slap their upper legs as a sign for unwanted company to depart.

John laughed, ""Well I certainly didn't hear any of those either. You seem to know almost everything, except how to use it."" Striza now remembering the earlier encounter responded timidly. ""Today was the first was the first time I wish I knew less.""

John, not wanting to crush her eagerness to learn about humanity, spoke softly, ""How about I teach you how to properly use that knowledge, and in return, I get to know about you."" Striza, now fully composed, answered, ""I'd like that. How about over some coffee, just so long as you don't choke on it this time?""",2,1768716806.0,HFY,2,0.75,False

1qg0sfo,https://i.redd.it/manwoim8n1eg1.png,Creating a guide for peak windows in coffee varieties,"Hi all,

I wanted to start the process of creating a resting guide for myself based on coffee variety separate from roast profile. Out of laziness and convenience, I've drifted towards having a rough guestimate approach to opening any particular bag of coffee based on expected roast level from roasters that I am familiar with or heard about, but I was inspired to come up with this chart after a recent experience of a truly beautiful tasting coffee - Sey Elora Lot #156 Ethiopian Landrace - suddenly going stale 34 days off roast halfway through the bag (opened 28 days off roast). I've enjoyed having a much more data driven approach to brewing coffee these days, so I hope some of the information I've gathered in the last 6 years while making and drinking pourovers are of some use. I also hope to gather good information from all of you as well. 

Some caveats and qualifications:

1. This is not a ""**guide**"". I am nowhere close to being knowledgeable enough to create a guide. This post is more a step towards creating a guide collectively. 
2. The ""data"" I've gathered is of course highly anecdotal based on personal experience, and some of the ""data"" is manipulated purely based on intuition. But most of it is based on notes I've taken along the way and using the average days off roast for when the bag was opened, when I deemed coffee had peaked, when I first detected staleness, and when I deemed it undrinkable. It's also not exhaustive since I have not tried every variety of coffee. 
3. This is not a discussion about roast level or roast profile, but as a baseline, I am assuming light roast (not UL or medium) and how a single roaster would approach all of the varieties. Some roasters have drastically different profiles for each varietal and process, but I think most have similar approaches for each different varietal. I'm not ignoring that there is a large spectrum of what is called ""light roast"", but I think that's a discussion for another time. 
4. Assume Washed process for each variety. Natural or other more interventional processing methods create too much noise for this discussion. 
5. Processing defects, infusions, transportation defects, storage defects, and roast defects all may influence how a roasted coffee bean ages, but for this discussion, I am assuming each coffee is theoretically free of defects. 
6. Under-rested is much harder to define or quantify than stale coffee, so I am not going to as it could also be highly dependent on brewing method. Some may choose to open a bag 2 weeks off roast and enjoy it for 2-3 months and some may choose to open that same bag 4, 5, or 6 weeks off and drink it all in 1 week, but what I am interested in is when any given coffee may peak and when it has become oxidized beyond recognization. Some peak window days are shifted forward to accomodate anticipated staling. 
7. The peak window chart is presented as a spectrum. From the least resilient to time to most, and the specific number of days off roast are maybe not quite as important. I am generally assuming 2-3 weeks for peak window (and window of consumption) from the start of a bag of coffee being opened to the coffee becoming stale, but I think some varieties have a much larger windows. Some pink bourbons (not UL) have tasted phenomenal at 3+ months off roast and for an additional month after opening. 

We should also probably discuss what staling tastes like as well:

* Usually identified by sudden or gradual drop off in taste with water, recipes, and storage methods kept the same. 
* Flat or muted aromas and flavor, hollow mid-palate, drying finish, unsupported acidity

I'm certainly expecting a lot of disagreement, but all thoughts are welcome!",8,1768716527.0,pourover,0,0.9,False

Right now I'm using a De'Longhi Arte 885 with a TimeMore C3S Pro manual grinder.  
I make about one cappuccino a day (up to 3 in a row if I have guests).  
I'm not crazy about coffee, my current setup gets me a better tasting coffee than a local cafes.  
but I do want something reliable, high quality, that will last me decades hopefully without any issues, with great brewing, and manual milk steaming for latte art, that can save me time in the morning, and save me money in the long run compared to buying coffee from local cafes.

I'm considering buying one of this machines:

1. De'Longhi La Specialista Arte EC9155
2. De'Longhi La Specialista Arte Evo EC9255
3. Breville Bambino Plus + Varia VS3 (2nd gen)
4. Breville Barista Express 875

It's important to note that I have 51mm accessories, so upgrading from De'Longhi to Breville will also add the cost of the accessories (like bottomless portafilter, needle distributor, tamper, puck screen etc') - around 150$/200$.

How do heal?","I (F) joined my current organization in 2023. My manager (""MF"") was a former colleague I’d been friendly with in the past. When I started, I was at the most vulnerable point of my life: I had just lost my dream job and ended a 9-year relationship. I was in total despair.

MF’s wife was pregnant and living in another city at the time. Being alone for the first time, he used my vulnerability to completely take over my life. He forced himself into every waking second of my day and would become angry or ""emotionally punish"" me if I tried to set boundaries.

He followed me to breakfast every morning, skipping his own meetings to wait for me. He’d get angry if I invited anyone else\*\*.\*\*

He’d book meetings during lunch to prevent me from eating with other colleagues. He’d visit my desk multiple times a day to force me to go for walks or coffee.

He sent ""Good Morning"" and ""Good Night"" texts every single day on my personal number. If I didn't reply, he’d confront me the next day and in my 1.1 discussions, saying he was ""really angry.""

He pressured me to invite him to my house (where I lived alone). I had to invite me once and he forced to come on my birthday and then refused to leave also he move from a chair to my bed and starting touching my leg while talking.

On business trips, he’d force physical proximity, he would force me to sit next to him (thighs touching on flights). He forced me to go on walks with him every night even if I told him I was tired and needed to rest. He insisted on post walk hugs, and would get angry if I refused.

He called me humiliating and sometimes sexual nicknames in the office bay for everyone to hear. I begged him to stop everyday for 1.5 years but he would refuse to stop and just laugh it off.

While doing all of this, he simultaneously blocked my promotions and put me in impossible project situations. He made sure I stayed dependent on him. He would orchestrate projects such that I would be put in difficult situations with my colleagues and they would see me as a threat, like making me lead of projects of my seniors. If he sees anyone getting nice to me he has to sabotage that relationship asap.

**R**esult is that My office has a high-gossip culture. Because I am firm and vocal in professional meetings, people assume I ""allowed"" this or was ""romancing"" a man with a pregnant wife. I am being labeled a ""who\*e"" by proxy. I have no friends at work because MF has climbed the ladder, and people don't want to associate with the ""boss’s girl.""

I have lost almost all my outside friends because he drained my ""social battery"" so completely that I isolated myself. My self-hatred is at an all-time high. I feel like I have no backbone, I let this happen to me because I am weak weasel.

I’m now experiencing depersonalization and thoughts of self-harm. I feel like my reputation in this small industry is permanently damaged. Meanwhile, his life is ""perfect"" promotions, a healthy baby, and a happy wife while I am left with the wreckage.

of these things have stopped because he has been propoted and they would make him look bad to his seniors. However, I am still isolated and not allowed to talk to anyone.

I cannot leave my job right now because the industry is bad and I am going through a tough personal situation and need the job and money.

I don't know how to move forward. I feel trapped, humiliated, and broken. How do I survive this predator?

1qg0liu,https://www.reddit.com/r/womenintech/comments/1qg0liu/my_manager_groomed_and_harassed_me_during_a/,"My manager groomed and harassed me during a vulnerable time, and now my reputation is ruined. How do heal?","I (F) joined my current organization in 2023. My manager (""MF"") was a former colleague I’d been friendly with in the past. When I started, I was at the most vulnerable point of my life: I had just lost my dream job and ended a 9-year relationship. I was in total despair.

MF’s wife was pregnant and living in another city at the time. Being alone for the first time, he used my vulnerability to completely take over my life. He forced himself into every waking second of my day and would become angry or ""emotionally punish"" me if I tried to set boundaries.

 He followed me to breakfast every morning, skipping his own meetings to wait for me. He’d get angry if I invited anyone else**.**

He’d book meetings during lunch to prevent me from eating with other colleagues. He’d visit my desk multiple times a day to force me to go for walks or coffee.

He sent ""Good Morning"" and ""Good Night"" texts every single day on my personal number. If I didn't reply, he’d confront me the next day and in my 1.1 discussions, saying he was ""really angry.""

He pressured me to invite him to my house (where I lived alone). I had to invite me once and he forced to come on my birthday and then refused to leave also he move from a chair to my bed and starting touching my leg while talking.

On business trips, he’d force physical proximity, he would force me to sit next to him (thighs touching on flights). He forced me to go on walks with him every night even if I told him I was tired and needed to rest. He insisted on post walk hugs, and would get angry if I refused.

He called me humiliating and sometimes sexual nicknames in the office bay for everyone to hear. I begged him to stop everyday for 1.5 years but he would refuse to stop and just laugh it off. 

While doing all of this, he simultaneously blocked my promotions and put me in impossible project situations. He made sure I stayed dependent on him. He would orchestrate projects such that I would be put in difficult situations with my colleagues and they would see me as a threat, like making me lead of projects of my seniors. If he sees anyone getting nice to me he has to sabotage that relationship asap. 

**R**esult is that My office has a high-gossip culture. Because I am firm and vocal in professional meetings, people assume I ""allowed"" this or was ""romancing"" a man with a pregnant wife. I am being labeled a ""who\*e"" by proxy. I have no friends at work because MF has climbed the ladder, and people don't want to associate with the ""boss’s girl.""

I have lost almost all my outside friends because he drained my ""social battery"" so completely that I isolated myself. My self-hatred is at an all-time high. I feel like I have no backbone, I let this happen to me because I am weak weasel. 

I’m now experiencing depersonalization and thoughts of self-harm. I feel like my reputation in this small industry is permanently damaged. Meanwhile, his life is ""perfect"" promotions, a healthy baby, and a happy wife while I am left with the wreckage. 

of these things have stopped because he has been propoted and they would make him look bad to his seniors. However, I am still isolated and not allowed to talk to anyone. 

I cannot leave my job right now because the industry is bad and I am going through a tough personal situation and need the job and money.

I don't know how to move forward. I feel trapped, humiliated, and broken. How do I survive this predator? I cannot sleep because I keep thinking of what has happened to me and how this would follow me for the rest of my life because a hor\*y a\*\*hole wanted fun. How do I live with myself and how do I reduce the impact on me?

1qg0jof,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qg0jof/the_psychology_of_getting_dangerously_motivated/,The Psychology of Getting DANGEROUSLY Motivated (Science-Backed Tactics That Actually Work),"You know what's wild? I spent months researching peak performance, combing through neuroscience papers, interviewing high achievers, and reading every dopamine-related study I could find. And I discovered something that completely changed how I approach motivation. Most people are chasing it wrong. They're waiting to ""feel motivated"" before taking action. That's backwards. That's why you're stuck.

Here's what actually works, backed by science and real world results.

**1. Your brain runs on dopamine hits, not vague dreams**

Stop setting fuzzy goals like ""get fit"" or ""be successful."" Your brain literally cannot compute that. Dr. Andrew Huberman's research on dopamine shows your nervous system needs concrete milestones to trigger motivation circuits. Instead of ""I want to lose weight,"" say ""I'm doing 20 pushups today at 7am."" The specificity creates a neural pathway your brain can actually follow.

I tested this myself. Changed ""read more"" to ""read 10 pages before coffee."" Suddenly my brain knew exactly what to chase. The clarity itself became addictive.

**2. Motion creates emotion, not the other way around**

This comes straight from Mel Robbins' work and honestly it sounds too simple to work but it does. You don't wait to feel like going to the gym. You count backwards from 5 and physically move your body before your brain can talk you out of it. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO.

Your feelings follow your actions, not vice versa. I know it sounds like some motivational poster bullshit but there's actual science here. The prefrontal cortex takes 5 seconds to kill a good impulse. So you have to move faster than your own excuses.

**3. Stop romanticizing struggle**

Nobody talks about this but constantly consuming motivational content actually makes you LESS motivated. It gives you a dopamine hit without doing anything. Your brain thinks it accomplished something just by watching that 15 minute YouTube video about discipline.

James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits (genuinely the most practical book on behavior change I've ever read, won multiple awards and sold over 15 million copies for a reason, this will make you question everything about how you approach goals). He calls it ""motion vs action."" Motion is planning, researching, strategizing. Action is actually doing the thing.

Cut the self help content by 80% and redirect that time into literally any form of action. Even shitty imperfect action beats perfect planning every single time.

**4. Your environment is secretly destroying your willpower**

You cannot discipline your way out of a bad environment. Period. If there are cookies on your counter you will eat them eventually. If your phone is on your nightstand you will scroll before bed. If your gym bag isn't packed you will skip the workout.

Make the good behavior the path of least resistance. I started using an app called Ash that literally coaches you through restructuring your environment for better habits. It's like having a behavioral psychologist in your pocket. The AI asks you questions about your space and routines then gives you specific changes to make. Insanely good for identifying the invisible friction points killing your motivation.

BeFreed is an AI-powered personalized learning app built by a team from Columbia University that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create custom podcasts around your specific goals. Type in something like ""build discipline"" or ""overcome procrastination"" and it generates an adaptive learning plan tailored to you, with episodes ranging from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives packed with examples and context.

The voice customization is ridiculously good, there's this smoky, sarcastic tone that somehow makes neuroscience digestible at 6am. Plus you can pause mid-episode to ask questions to your virtual coach Freedia, which beats rewinding a regular podcast five times trying to catch one concept. For anyone serious about understanding the psychology behind behavior change instead of just collecting motivational quotes, it's been a solid tool for turning insights into actual practice.

**5. Stack tiny wins until momentum becomes inevitable**

BJ Fogg's research at Stanford proves that motivation follows action, not the other way around. Start absurdly small. Want to meditate? Do 3 breaths. Want to write? Do 1 sentence. Want to exercise? Do 1 pushup.

Sounds ridiculous but here's why it works, your brain doesn't distinguish between small wins and big wins in terms of dopamine release. A win is a win. So you game the system by racking up easy victories until the momentum carries you forward naturally.

I use Finch for this, it's a habit building app with a little bird that grows as you complete tasks. Sounds childish but the visual progress is weirdly powerful. You can set micro habits like ""drink water"" or ""5 minute walk"" and watching that bird evolve creates a feedback loop your brain craves.

**6. Boredom is the secret weapon nobody uses**

Every peak performer I researched had the same trait, they could tolerate boredom better than average people. They didn't need constant stimulation or variety or fun. They could show up and do the boring work day after day without needing it to be exciting.

Cal Newport covers this in Deep Work. The ability to do focused, undistracted work is becoming rare which makes it incredibly valuable. But you can't develop that ability if you're constantly feeding your brain dopamine hits through social media, notifications, and entertainment.

Try this, sit with boredom for 10 minutes without reaching for your phone. Just sit there. It will be uncomfortable as hell at first. That discomfort is your brain rewiring itself to tolerate the mundane effort that actually builds things.

**7. Identity beats willpower every single time**

This is straight from Atomic Habits but it's so important I'm repeating it. Don't say ""I want to run a marathon."" Say ""I am a runner."" The identity shift changes everything. You're not trying to motivate yourself to do something foreign. You're just acting according to who you already are.

When I stopped saying ""I should write"" and started saying ""I am a writer,"" I wrote every day for 6 months straight. The behavior became non negotiable because it was tied to my self concept, not my fleeting motivation levels.

Listen, motivation is not some mystical force that visits you randomly. It's a predictable chemical response you can engineer through specific actions. The people who seem naturally motivated aren't special, they just understand the mechanics better.

Stop waiting for inspiration. Stop consuming endless content about getting started. Your brain is wired to keep you comfortable and safe which means it will always find reasons to delay.

The gap between where you are and where you want to be isn't filled with motivation. It's filled with action. Imperfect, unglamorous, boring action repeated until it becomes automatic.

You already know what you need to do. The question is whether you'll move before your brain talks you out of it again.",1,1768715758.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

1qg0a9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/centuryhomes/comments/1qg0a9c/converting_a_1907_four_square_to_commercial/,Converting A 1907 Four Square To Commercial,"Hi all, thought I’d post on my current project.  I bought a 1907 Four Square and am converting it to commercial: bookstore-cafe on first floor, my office on second floor.  The lot is zoned commercial already.  

It is not actually a “house”, although it started life as a nice big one.  Sometime before WW2 it was converted to “flats and a store”, in 1942 the store was converted to a third flat.  The ground floor was converted back to retail use (barbershop) briefly in the 2000s but for most of the last century, it’s been a rental triplex.  

So far, there has been been a ton of reviewing codes and meetings between my architect and the city, to figure out what I’ll be required to do for this “change of use” from multifamily to commercial, not least being ADA requirements.  Almost four months of that, before I was willing to pull the trigger.  

Then I had to get in there and plan out the commercial kitchen and coffee bar, bring my electrician and a plumber through, draw plans and have my architect put together a permit and change of use application.

Before we can file the permits with the city, the county has to approve the restaurant plans, equipment, menu, etc.  

I should get the county approval any day, then we file permits and wait for those to be reviewed - 2+ months I’m told. 

So I haven’t been able to do much at the triplex except demo work.  So far I’ve gutted the kitchen and foyer, which is where the bulk of the electrical and plumbing will be, torn out some curtain walls, etc.  Lots and lots of lath and plaster, old sheetrock, etc - I’ve filled two dropboxes with debris and almost done with the third.  I just hired a guy to finish the demo - take the ceilings off those rooms, demo the bathroom, other demo.  Whew - that’s nasty work I was getting pretty tired of doing.

I’ll be turning to building some furnishings - bookcases, coffee bar, tables, some railing-counters for the porch.  On the second floor, I’ll pull the baseboards and cut out the underlying lath & plaster, so my electrician can add receptacles and rewire, and build a wall to reverse work done when that floor was converted to a flat in 1942.  

Hopefully I’ll have my permits in March and then the electrical and plumbing can get done.  Every place those trades touch will already be opened up, to make their work faster.  As you can imagine, there will be a lot of electrical and floor sinks everywhere.  

We’re hoping to open the bookstore-cafe in summer.

What does this have to do with “century houses”?  Maybe not that much, other than the building being a former house that is over a century old.  It was a pretty fine house once, but after so many decades of retail and rental use, most of the original details are gone.  So this isn’t a loving restoration of a cherished home, but rather a conversion to full commercial use.  

Still, many of the things we face in century houses are the same here - knob & tube, lath & plaster, bodgy old work, unstraight walls and lumpy floors.

I've posted here before and had a few fun and interesting chats, even a few IRL dates, but I'm still looking for a real lasting connection. Anything real or worthwhile is hard to find in the sea of ""fakeness"" these days. That goes for real life and on dating apps. There's a lot of people who like to ghost and not say anything. It's unfortunate that a lot of people are so fake but I'm holding out hope that I can meet the right person either IRL or online eventually.

Let's actually normalize being genuine and nice to each other? \*mind blown

**---**

**About me:**

I'm a 31 year old average looking white dude with an average physique from North Carolina. I'm not hellbent on staying here either. In fact, I am actually looking to leave! I look pretty young and still get carded all the time, lol. College educated with a bachelors degree debt free, I own my own successful business that I run from my home workshop. No debt or kids & financially responsible, but I love to have fun too.

I love camping/hiking and traveling! I think I've been to over 35 states! I love listening to music & playing PC games. Maybe we could play stuff together? I also enjoy reading and listening to audiobooks/podcasts. I would like to get a motorcycle at some point. I'm pretty easygoing generally. I'm also open to trying any new hobbies with my partner that they'd like to introduce me to. I enjoy going to food festivals and trying new types of food too. I love making coffee runs and just driving around, lol!

One day, I'd like to have a house in the mountains with a few acres of land that is completely paid off. Would be awesome to escape the ""system"" in small ways. Who wants to be on a debt treadmill their whole life? Not me! I'm 420 friendly but I don't really partake with the exception of the rare edible a few times per year just to relax.

Honestly I am a pretty social and goofy guy. I would describe myself as an ambivert. INTJ, dry/dark sense of humor, I love making people laugh when I can. A bit nerdy at times, mainly about PC games and history.

\---

**What I'm looking for:**

I am looking to connect with someone worthwhile and sane between the ages of 24-36 with no kids. Preferably inside the USA! I like text chatting but calling is ideal and better in my opinion. Obviously I don't expect us to call right away but it's a much better way of actually getting to know you long-term.

I am a very dedicated and affectionate person in relationships, and really try my best even though I am nowhere near perfect. (Not even close.) I try to understand the other person I'm with to the best of my ability and be thoughtful and caring. I just want to find something peaceful with someone one day. I love hugs.

I want to be around someone who gives me peace and to be able to sit around a campfire with you sipping coffee and making smores or having a picnic having a deep hearty laugh.

1qg08v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1qg08v1/why_does_australian_vietnamese_iced_coffee_have/,Why does Australian Vietnamese iced coffee have insanely high caffeine?,"First time trying Vietnamese iced coffee this Friday. The strong caffeine in it hit me like a truck. It's Sunday afternoon now and I haven't slept a wink over two nights. I googled, and **Vietnamese iced coffee is equal to FOUR espressos' worth of caffeine**. That's insane! This isn't a drink, it's a drug. They might as well be pouring raw meth and stimulants into it.

Why isn't Australian Vietnamese iced coffee sold with a health warning for excessive caffeine?

The Panera charged lemonades that were killing people with heart attacks in the USA only has 235mg of caffeine, with ice. By comparison, a cup of Vietnamese coffee has 265mg of caffeine - four espresso shots or four lattes! And Vietnamese iced coffee comes in these deceptively small cups compared to 900ml of charged lemonade. I almost had two Vietnamese iced coffees yesterday - that would have sent me to the hospital for sure.

We need PSA health warnings for people unused to Vietnamese food like me. I moved to Melbourne from New Zealand. We don't have a Banh Mi culture over there. Vietnamese food is pretty rare in NZ, so this was my first time having Vietnamese iced coffee on Friday. I thought it'd be a harmless sweet drink, like the Starbucks coffees I usually have, but I'm still wired and amped up after three days. It's a horrible feeling. I'm jittery and my mind is all over the place, so I can't do anything useful, just watch TV/play video games mindlessly. I felt so guilty playing video games for 24 hours on Saturday, so Sunday I went to the gym and lifted weights and cycled for 8 hours trying to burn off this caffeine.

I'm mostly posting to ask - does anyone have any remedies to comedown from a persistent caffeine high??? After a whole weekend being wide awake, I NEED a good sleep on Sunday night or I'll be a wreck at work on Monday. If no-one has suggestions, alcohol is a depressant (the opposite of a stimulant like coffee).  So I'm going to drink like three Guinness tonight to try to counteract the Vietnamese coffee.",0,1768714787.0,AskAnAustralian,25,0.33,False

I've posted here before and had a few fun and interesting chats, even a few IRL dates, but I'm still looking for a real lasting connection. Anything real or worthwhile is hard to find in the sea of ""fakeness"" these days. That goes for real life and on dating apps. There's a lot of people who like to ghost and not say anything. It's unfortunate that a lot of people are so fake but I'm holding out hope that I can meet the right person either IRL or online eventually.

Let's actually normalize being genuine and nice to each other? \*mind blown

**About me:**

I'm a 31 year old average looking white dude with an average physique from North Carolina. I'm not hellbent on staying here either. In fact, I am actually looking to leave! I look pretty young and still get carded all the time, lol. College educated with a bachelors degree debt free, I own my own successful business that I run from my home workshop. No debt or kids & financially responsible, but I love to have fun too.

I love camping/hiking and traveling! I think I've been to over 35 states! I love listening to music & playing PC games. Maybe we could play stuff together? I also enjoy reading and listening to audiobooks/podcasts. I would like to get a motorcycle at some point. I'm pretty easygoing generally. I'm also open to trying any new hobbies with my partner that they'd like to introduce me to. I enjoy going to food festivals and trying new types of food too. I love making coffee runs and just driving around, lol!

One day, I'd like to have a house in the mountains with a few acres of land that is completely paid off. Would be awesome to escape the ""system"" in small ways. Who wants to be on a debt treadmill their whole life? Not me! I'm 420 friendly but I don't really partake with the exception of the rare edible a few times per year just to relax.

Honestly I am a pretty social and goofy guy. I would describe myself as an ambivert. INTJ, dry/dark sense of humor, I love making people laugh when I can. A bit nerdy at times, mainly about PC games and history.

\---

**What I'm looking for:**

I am looking to connect with someone worthwhile and sane between the ages of 24-36 with no kids. Preferably inside the USA! I like text chatting but calling is ideal and better in my opinion. Obviously I don't expect us to call right away but it's a much better way of actually getting to know you long-term.

I am a very dedicated and affectionate person in relationships, and really try my best even though I am nowhere near perfect. (Not even close.) I try to understand the other person I'm with to the best of my ability and be thoughtful and caring. I just want to find something peaceful with someone one day. I love hugs.

I want to be around someone who gives me peace and to be able to sit around a campfire with you sipping coffee and making smores or having a picnic having a deep hearty laugh. Maybe play video games together or go on a walk too. I'd love to feel completely comfortable around you. I would like to get to know eachother on a deeper level than ever before, if it feels right. I'd like to find someone who is okay with me showing an emotional side even though I am a guy. Someone I could take on cute dates and treat well.

1qg0363,https://i.redd.it/nupif14ln1eg1.jpeg,Obedient Until I Broke,"
I was the most obedient child in our village.
But my adoptive mother, Griselda Langfrey, was anything but kind to me.
When my younger brother fell because I hadn't watched him closely enough, she beat my left shin with a stick until it broke.
""You worthless burden! Why don't you just die? I'm the one who saved your life—so give it back to me!""
I looked at her and nodded. ""Okay, Mom.""
Then, I turned around, picked up the weed killer from the table, twisted the cap open, and tipped my head back to drink.
Griselda froze in shock.
Screaming, she lunged forward and knocked the bottle out of my hands, but I had already swallowed a mouthful.
I was rushed to the hospital that same night and remained in intensive care for several days.
The incident blew up and made the news, and that was how my biological parents found me.
When they brought me back, my older brother, Jackson Schneider, called me filthy and told me to wash up.
So I scrubbed every inch of my body with a scrub pad until my skin broke and blood seeped out.
Later, Malvina Schneider—my parents' beloved adopted daughter, endlessly praised by everyone—burst into tears and said I was disgusting, that she didn't want to see me.
Jackson pointed at the balcony and shouted at me, ""Why don't you just die?""
I looked at him and smiled. ""Okay, Jack.""
Then I turned and jumped.
At that moment, I heard Jackson's gut-wrenching scream.
\*\*\*
My life proved tougher than expected—I survived.
But I quickly noticed that my family didn't seem happy about it.
""She is not my sister! I have only one sister—Mal! Who knows what horrible habits she picked up out in the countryside? Just days after she came back, she tried to kill herself. She's clearly doing it to manipulate us!""
The door opened, and a tall young man walked in.
It was my biological brother, Jackson.
Behind him stood a girl in white, looking innocent and sweet.
She was Malvina, my biological parents' adopted daughter.
Malvina's eyes were rimmed red as she looked at me timidly. ""Whit... you're finally awake. It's my fault. I shouldn't have said those awful things.""
Jackson patted her shoulder with deep concern, then fixed his cold gaze on me.
""Whitney Schneider, I'm warning you. Now that you're back, behave yourself. Mal is the most important one in this family. Stop with your crying, your tantrums, and threats. If you want to kill yourself again, do it somewhere else so you don't dirty our home.""
I pulled the IV from my hand, and blood immediately welled up.
I looked at Jackson and nodded obediently. ""Okay, Jack.""
He frowned, seemingly unsettled by the sight of the blood trickling across my skin.
""What are you doing?""
""I'm going to die somewhere far away.""
I threw back the blanket to get out of bed. Every movement sent a violent coughing fit through my damaged lungs, blood dripping from my hand onto the floor.
Jackson's expression shifted instantly.
Malvina shrieked, ""Whit, you're bleeding!""
Just then, my mom, Sophia Maddox, burst into the room.
When she saw what was happening, she shoved Jackson aside and rushed to scoop me back onto the bed.
""What the hell are you doing? Are you really going to stop only when you kill her?""
Jackson stood frozen, staring at the blood on the floor. ""Lunatic,"" he muttered.
Once I was discharged, I was taken back to the Schneider's mansion.
At dinner, the table was laid with a lavish spread of seafood.
Malvina sat between my parents, smoothly serving everyone.
""Dad gets the crab, Mom gets the shrimp, and Jack gets this piece of oyster.""
They were the picture of a happy family.
I sat there like an outsider, holding my fork without knowing what to do.
""Whit, try some of this."" Malvina picked up a lobster and gently placed it on my plate.
""It's an Australian lobster, flown in fresh. Really sweet. Bet you never had anything like this out in the countryside.""
She smiled, all sweet and innocent, but I knew she was doing it on purpose.
During my medical exam, the doctor had made it perfectly clear that I was severely allergic to seafood—my throat could swell shut. Malvina had been standing right there when he said it.
I stared at the lobster on my plate.
""Why aren't you eating?"" Jackson set down his fork and looked at me with irritation. ""Malvina was kind enough to give you the lobster. What's with your attitude? Do you think it's dirty or something?""
I looked at Mom. She was busy wiping Malvina's mouth, not sparing me a glance. Dad was scrolling on his phone.
""Whit, do you not like the way I served it?"" Malvina lowered her eyes, her voice soft and wounded.
""Whitney!"" Jackson slammed his hand on the table. ""Just eat it! Don't be ungrateful! In this house, if Malvina gives you anything, you take it—no questions, no excuses!""
""Jack, watch how you speak to your sister,"" Mom finally said.
But it was little more than a soft reminder. Then she looked at me. ""Whit, just eat it. Don't upset your brother. Mal meant well.""
I picked up my fork and lifted the lobster.
""Okay, Mom.""
Chapter 2
I put the lobster into my mouth, chewed, and swallowed.
It really was sweet, but its sweetness carried the taste of death.
Within three minutes, my throat started to tighten. Red welts spread across my skin, and breathing became difficult, like invisible fingers were closing around my neck.
""Cough... Cough..."" I couldn't hold back the sound.
""Shut up!"" Jackson shot me a disgusted glare. ""You're eating, so why make those weird noises? You have no manners at all!""
I immediately clamped a hand over my mouth.
He told me to be quiet, so I couldn't make a sound.
My airway swelled more and more; oxygen was slipping away. My face turned a dark purplish red, and cold sweat rolled down my forehead.
Still, I sat upright with my hand over my mouth, not daring to make a noise.
My fork slipped from my fingers and hit the floor.
A second later, my whole body slid off the chair and hit the carpet with a heavy thud.
""Whit!"" Mom cried out.
Malvina jumped to her feet, terrified. ""What's wrong with her?""
Jackson walked over, frowning, and kicked my leg. ""Quit acting. Get up!""
I didn't move. I couldn't move.
Walter Schneider finally noticed something was wrong. He rushed over and flipped me onto my back.
When he saw my swollen, discolored face, he nearly lost his soul. ""An allergic reaction. It's anaphylactic shock! Call an ambulance, quick!""
The whole place erupted into chaos.
When they lifted me onto the stretcher, my eyes were still open, staring directly at Jackson.
My hand remained firmly clamped over my mouth.
Jackson had gone pale. His hands were shaking.
He looked at my hand covering my lips and seemed to remember the words he had thrown at me moments earlier.
After spending several days in the hospital, I survived again.
I was hard to kill, like a rat in a sewer.
When I woke up, only Malvina and Jackson were in the room.
Malvina was crying dramatically, tears streaming down her face. ""Jack, it's all my fault... I forgot Whit was allergic. I didn't mean to...""
Jackson wiped her tears tenderly. ""It's not your fault. You're too kind. She's the stupid one. Didn't she know to tell us she's allergic? What does she even have a mouth for?""
Then, he turned and saw me awake. The affection in his eyes turned into disgust.
""Whitney, did you do this on purpose?"" He jabbed a finger at me. ""Were you trying to frame Malvina? Are you trying to make Mom and Dad think she meant to kill you? How could you be so vicious?""
I removed the oxygen mask. My voice was raw and scraped. ""You told me to eat, so I ate.
""You told me to shut up, so I shut up.""
Jackson froze.
He opened his mouth to argue, but something in my flat, lifeless stare made fear flicker across his face.
""You're... unbelievable and completely insane!""
He grabbed Malvina's arm and pulled her toward the door. ""Come on, Malvina. Don't waste your time on this lunatic.""
When I returned home, the atmosphere had shifted.
My parents were a little more guilty toward me, but that was the extent of it. They were far more worried about whether Malvina would be traumatized by all this.
To seem fair, Mom gave me a diamond necklace.
It had originally been intended as one of Malvina's birthday presents.
""Whit, I picked this especially for you. Do you like it?"" Sophia asked as she gently fastened it around my neck.
I liked it very much.
It was the first gift I had ever received in my life.
Malvina stood nearby and said wistfully, ""It's so pretty. It suits you so well. It's a shame I don't have one... But as long as you're happy, that's what matters.""
Jackson snorted. ""Giving it to her is a waste. A bumpkin wearing diamonds is ridiculous.""
He came over and tugged at my necklace with disdain. ""This chain is sharp. Don't scratch that thick hide of yours. Also, you smell like poverty. No amount of diamonds will cover it up. Go wash. If you can't wash the smell off, don't come out and embarrass us.""
I touched the necklace, then my arm. ""Okay, Jack.""
I went into the bathroom and locked the door.
I didn't shower. I went to the cabinet under the sink and found a scrub pad meant for cleaning.
If they thought I was dirty and smelled poor, then I just had to scrub the skin off.
Without skin, I should be clean.
I pressed the scrub pad against my arm and scrubbed hard once, then twice.
The skin broke, and blood seeped out.
I felt no pain.
I only remembered Jackson telling me to wash the smell off.
I scrubbed my left arm, then my right, my neck, and my chest.
Blood soaked my white robe and dripped down my legs onto the floor.
The bathroom was filled with the smell of blood.
Half an hour later, Malvina knocked on the door.
""Whit? Are you in there? Mom wants you to come down for some fruit.""
I didn't answer. I was busy scrubbing my thigh.
""Whit?"" Malvina tried the doorknob and found it locked. ""Jack! She locked herself in the bathroom!""
Footsteps hurried toward the door.
""Whitney! What are you doing in there? Come out!"" Jackson pounded on the door.
I was nearly finished, so I opened it.
Jackson was mid-kick, and he froze with his foot raised.
I stood in the doorway. There wasn't a patch of intact skin on me—just blood and shredded flesh, like a creature freshly skinned.
But I was smiling, holding the scrub pad that was dripping with blood.
""Jack."" I raised my bloody arm to show him. ""I scrubbed myself clean. Is the smell still there?""
""Ah!"" Malvina shrieked, rolled her eyes back, and fainted.
Jackson recoiled violently, stumbling backward like he had been struck by lightning.
He leaned against the wall, gagging. ""Y-You...""
He pointed at me, his hand shaking so hard he couldn't form a full sentence.
Mom rushed in, saw me, and immediately collapsed.
I was confused.
""Wasn't I obedient? Why were they so afraid of me?"" I wondered.
Chapter 3
After that incident, the way the entire family looked at me changed.
No one dared order me around anymore. Even Malvina would walk the long way around whenever she saw me.
I knew the peace wouldn't last.
A week later, it was Malvina's birthday. Our family hosted a small gathering, inviting a few relatives and her friends.
Malvina owned a gray parrot named Poppy, and everyone adored it. It was smart, charming, and could even recite poetry.
Before the party started, I sat on the corner of the couch, staring into space.
Malvina walked over carrying the birdcage.
""Whit, isn't Poppy cute?"" She opened the cage and let the parrot out.
It flapped its wings and landed on the coffee table in front of me.
Tilting its head, it suddenly shrieked, ""Die, bumpkin!
""Whitney is a witch! Die!
""You unwanted bastard. Die!""
The entire living room—relatives, friends, my parents, and Jackson—froze in shock.
Malvina clamped a hand over her mouth, looking terrified. ""Poppy! What are you saying? Who taught you that?!""
She turned to Mom and Dad, her tears falling instantly.
""Dad, Mom, I never taught it to that! I don't know where it picked up those words... Maybe it overheard some gossip...""
Jackson's face darkened, though he didn't scold Malvina.
Instead, he looked at me with a cold, venomous glare. ""Was it you? Did you teach the parrot to say that so you could frame Mal?""
I looked at the bird that was still screeching death threats, then at Jackson, who was twisting the truth.
""No,"" I said calmly.
""Still denying it?"" Jackson marched toward me. ""Who else in this house hates themselves enough to teach a bird that? Mal is too kind—she'd never do something like that. You must have taught it, trying to humiliate her today!
""Whitney, you're hopeless. There's something rotten in your mind!""
He grabbed a cup from the table and hurled it at my feet, shattering it.
""Apologize to Mal! And to this bird!""
I looked down at the shards. ""Apologize?""
""Yes! If you don't apologize, get out of this house! Our family doesn't need a vicious daughter like you!""
I nodded. ""Okay, Jack.""
I stood and walked toward the parrot.
A flash of satisfaction crossed Malvina's eyes. She thought I would bow, cry, and be humiliated.
I reached out and grabbed the parrot.
It screeched, ""Bitch! Die!""
""It's rude,"" I said, looking at Jackson. ""Mom said rudeness deserves punishment.
""It told me to die. It did something wrong.""
""What are you doing? Put Poppy down!"" Malvina screamed, sensing danger.
""I want it to be quiet."" I clenched my hand.
There was a sharp crack. The parrot's head tilted at an unnatural angle, and its voice stopped instantly.
I tossed the dead bird into Malvina's arms.
""Ah! Poppy!"" Malvina collapsed on the floor, bawling hysterically. ""Whitney! I'm going to kill you!""
Jackson lost his mind. He rushed at me and slapped me, hard.
The blow was brutal.
My head snapped to the side, my mouth filled with blood, and my ears rang.
""You're a monster! An animal!""
He seized me by the throat and slammed me onto the couch, his eyes burning red.
""That was Mal's favorite bird! How could you kill it? How could you be so cruel?
""Why didn't you just die? Why did you come back to torment us?""
The choking sensation grew stronger, but I didn't struggle. I didn't even blink.
Walter and Sophia finally reacted and yanked Jackson off me. ""Jack, stop! You'll strangle her!""
He was trembling with rage, still pointing at me as he panted. ""Let her die! What's the point of keeping a freak like her around? Go away! Get out of my house! Get out of my sight!""
I pushed myself up from the couch and touched my burning cheek.
""Go away?"" I repeated softly.
""Yes! Go away! Never let me see you again!"" Jackson roared.
I looked at him and smiled.
It was a genuine, relieved smile.
""Okay, Jack.""
I turned and walked toward the balcony. We were on the second floor. Below us was a yard paved with solid marble.
Sensing something, Sophia asked with a shaky voice, ""Whitney, what are you doing?""
I didn't respond. I walked faster.
I pushed open the doors. A gust of wind swept in, lifting the hem of my thin dress.
Malvina stopped crying and stared blankly.
Jackson's expression shifted from fury to shock, and then to panic.
I climbed onto the railing with practiced movements that made the sight heartbreaking.
""Whit! Get down! Don't do anything stupid!"" Walter shouted as he ran toward me.
I stood on the railing, looking down at my family.
""Jack told me to go away.
""I'm a good girl.
""I always listen to Jack.""
After saying that, I spread my arms and leaned back.

Like genuinely scared. I spent months diving into research on this, books, podcasts, psychology papers and realized most of us have completely misunderstood what solitude actually means. We've been conditioned to see alone time as punishment as something wrong with us as a gap that needs filling immediately with noise or people or scrolling. But that's BS.

The real issue isn't being alone. it's that we never learned how to be comfortable in our own company. Society glorifies constant connection, busyness, packed schedules. Being alone got rebranded as loneliness somewhere along the way, and we internalized that. Your brain isn't broken for struggling with this, it's actually responding exactly how it was trained to respond. But the cool part? You can retrain it. And when you do, being alone stops feeling like deprivation and starts feeling like freedom.

**The first shift is understanding solitude vs loneliness.** Loneliness is that hollow ache, that feeling of disconnection even in a crowded room. Solitude is intentional, chosen, rejuvenating. The psychologist [Sherry Turkle](https://sherryturkle.mit.edu/) talks about this in her work on reclaiming conversation, how we've become so afraid of being alone that we're losing the capacity for self reflection. Without solitude, you can't actually know yourself. You're just reacting to everyone else's energy all the time, performing different versions of yourself. Real talk, some of my best ideas and clearest thinking happened when I stopped filling every silent moment with podcasts or texts or whatever. Just sitting there, being bored, letting my mind wander. Sounds basic but it's actually hard as hell at first.

**Reframe alone time as investment in yourself, not isolation from others.** Start small. Like genuinely small. Take yourself on a solo coffee run without your phone. Sit in a park for 20 minutes doing nothing. The discomfort you feel? That's normal. Your brain is essentially going through withdrawal from constant stimulation. Dr. Sara Maitland wrote this incredible book called [A Book of Silence](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/ukl-review-maitland-bookofsilence) where she explores different types of silence and solitude across cultures and history. She's a novelist and scholar who literally moved to rural Scotland to experience extended solitude, won awards for her writing, and her insights are insanely good. This book will make you question everything you think you know about needing constant company. She breaks down how silence and solitude have been sources of creativity, spiritual growth, and psychological depth for centuries. After reading it I genuinely stopped seeing alone time as something to escape and started protecting it.

**Build routines that you actually enjoy doing solo.** Not productive routines necessarily, just things that feel good. Morning walks, cooking elaborate meals for yourself, learning an instrument, whatever clicks. The author Mason Currey documented this in **Daily Rituals**, profiling how hundreds of creative people structured their days and spoiler alert, most of them carved out significant alone time. It's a compilation of routines from artists, writers, scientists, and you realize that solitude was integral to their best work. Makes you feel less weird about needing it.

**Use tech mindfully when alone.** This sounds preachy but hear me out. There's a massive difference between choosing to watch a movie alone versus compulsively scrolling because silence feels uncomfortable. One is intentional enjoyment, the other is avoidance. The app **Medito** is actually clutch for building comfort with stillness. it's a completely free meditation app, no subscriptions, no upsells, just guided practices that help you sit with yourself. Some people hate meditation but honestly it's just practicing being present in your own head without judgment. Start with like 5 minutes. You'd be surprised how chatty and critical your inner voice is when you actually listen to it, and how much that softens with practice.

Another resource worth checking out is [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) an AI powered learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized podcasts. What makes it different is how it customizes both the content and the learning plan based on what you're specifically working on, like building comfort with solitude or understanding your own patterns better. You can adjust the depth too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples when something really clicks. The voice options are honestly addictive, there's this smoky, sarcastic style that makes dense psychology concepts way more digestible. It pulls from science-based sources and creates an adaptive learning plan that evolves as you progress. Been using it during walks and it's replaced a lot of mindless scrolling time, which has genuinely helped clear up some of that mental noise.

**Examine your fear of missing out.** FOMO is such a real thing and it makes solitude feel threatening. You're alone on a Friday night and suddenly your brain is like everyone else is out having the time of their lives and you're a loser. Except that's not reality, that's anxiety talking. The research from social psychologist Sherry Turkle and others shows that people who are comfortable being alone actually form deeper connections with others because they're not desperate for validation or distraction. They choose connection from a place of wanting it, not needing it. That's powerful.

**Create a space that feels like yours.** Physical environment matters more than people realize. Clean your room add plants get lighting that doesn't feel like a hospital. Make your space somewhere you genuinely want to be. When your environment feels good, being alone in it feels different. Less like confinement, more like sanctuary.

The shift from dreading alone time to enjoying it isn't instant. It's gradual, sometimes uncomfortable, definitely worth it. You start noticing things about yourself your actual preferences not just what you've absorbed from others. You become better company for yourself, which weirdly makes you better company for others too. You stop needing people to complete you or distract you and relationships become about genuine connection instead of filling voids.

Being comfortable alone doesn't mean you become some antisocial hermit. It means you have a choice. You can enjoy solitude AND meaningful relationships. They're not opposing forces, they actually feed each other. Once you stop running from yourself everything else clicks into place differently",1,1768713989.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False

1qfzu99,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1qfzu99/for_those_who_worked_in_toxic_jobs_please_give_me/,For those who worked in toxic jobs please give me advice?,"I got fired from a job I loved a couple months ago because the company couldnt afford to keep us anymore, I immediately began searching and quickly found a job at a pastry shop. I was excited because I dealt with pastries in my past job and was praised for my work. turns out this job has been nothing but hell because of the manager.

to start off as well, I struggle on many aspects, I know I do, im autistic and I miss alot of social cues but Ive been working on them with a psychologist.

to start, the first day my manager scolded me for using 5oz of milk instead of 4 and said I practically ruined the whole thing. then another time I was cleaning the station because the day was extremely slow and he yelled at me, saying that he never told me to clean the tables and if I was too blind to see that he already cleaned it. 

I could handle that but then he told me how fast I could do dishes, I was honest and said the question confused me because I never timed myself and he immediately grabbed his watch and told me he was gonna time me while I did the dishes. 

Last week he tried to get me fired because I mixed up 2 orders. the customers were both women with children around the same age and I put one receipt in my pocket and one on the table to remember the order but he demanded I placed both receipts on the table, I did and began the order and then midway he told me to begin the other one on top of refilling some things. I told him that I was gonna get confused and to please let me organize myself but he responded with something along the lines off ""you cant multitask? how have you ever maintained a job when you cant do that? its so basic its concerning"" so I tried, I really did, I got overwhelmed and began scratching my head and rocking back and forth as I prepared the orders and he was behind me and kept asking ""whats wrong with you? what are you doing? why are you packaging it like that?"" and I ended up mixing up the orders. he scolded me badly and told me to stay in the back and not touch or do anything, that he didnt want himself or the customers to see me, hear me, or even know i exist. later that day he made a call to the boss right in front of me and kept saying I kept making horrific mistakes and wasnt able to perform my job at all. 

somehow the boss didnt decide to fire me, but now it has turned into them excluding me from work events and groupchats. apparently there is a work groupchat that discusses schedules, upcoming changes, holiday offers, etc. about th workplace and found out I was the only employee excluded from it. he would just send me my schedule personally. not to mention apparently the boss invited everyone out to eat and it was the managers job to notify everyone and of course, I had no idea that happened until I heard coworkers talking about it. even hires that were newer then me got invited.

Last but not least the last time I was at work and ended my shift he didnt let me leave and told me to clean up the slushie and coffee machine. I did, but it wasnt enough, he gave me a screwdriver and told me take apart both machines to clean each part including the screws. maybe I should have spoke up but I didnt and I followed his orders, next day he got offended that I bought a coffee from the gas station rather then have a coffee from the store. I told him I didnt want to clean the coffee maker and that I also was just too tired to make it myself and he proceeded to tell me he could have made my coffee for me, that the coffee I was drinking was cheap and bad quality and told me ""next time you want a coffee, im gonna make it so you know what a real coffee is""

did I mention he hasn't put in the order for a work shirt? ive been using my own clothing despite there being a uniform with the logo on it, everyone has a shirt including the new hires but whenever I ask about it he always makes up an excuse ""their closed for the time being, there was an issue with the order, we think your shirt got lost while being transferred here"" etc. 

I dont have any other source of income but this job, I can barely afford food as is, ive been sending out dozens and dozens of resumes to anywhere, gas stations, fast food, bakeries, pharmacies, supermarket, anywhere that will take me but I havent gotten a call, its so bad that ive been having nightmares consistently and sometimes I cant sleep at all because my anxiety is so high and I started shaking and having meltdowns. 

I dont know what to do, some of my friends told me its just part of life and every job is shitty but other friends have told me this job is not worth the cost of my mental health. tomorrow I have a shift and im dreading it because not only is it with my manager but another coworker who doesn't seem to like me. 

I dont know what I did, ive tried to just do as im told, I try not to ask too many questions, I try to perform my best, I dont know what im doing wrong. I basically begged him to tell me what I can do to make him satisfied with my performance and he said nothing. LITERALLY ""nothing"" he didnt stay silent, just told me that one word and walked off. 

its 1am and im shaking, im nauseous, ive been scratching at my skin because everything feels wrong. please, how am I suppose to survive and maintain my basic needs when this manager is making my life hell? ",3,1768713522.0,careerguidance,3,1.0,False

It’s been about a year and a half since I last played, and I’m really struggling with weapon builds. 

Prior to the break I had finally broken into the meta with a near perfect railway rifle. 

That seems bad now, so I tried pivoting to an onslaught elders mark. 

The build from YouTube seems good, but clunky without a ton of food buffs and canned coffee. 

I also don’t have any way to sustain the ammo use. 

My armor is also definitely not the best and isn’t min/maxed - when I left off I was working toward SS. 

I’m level 183, have done most content in the game prior to my hiatus. 

Essentially the question is what builds are approachable and don’t require massive grinds? 

I just want something I can do everything with and eventually work into the raid. 

I like the idea of a Western Spirit / Revolver build working toward the compound bow, but is it viable for the random world boss events and such? 

At this point I feel like I’m forced back into a holy fire PA build just to not have to struggle. ",3,1768712939.0,fo76,2,0.8,False
1qfzn8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1qfzn8x/how_to_be_an_actually_good_boyfriend_sciencebased/,How to Be an ACTUALLY Good Boyfriend: Science-Based Relationship Psychology Nobody Tells You,"Honestly, this whole thing started when I noticed how many dudes around me (myself included at one point) were putting in effort but still somehow fucking things up. like you're trying, you care, but she's still unhappy, and you're confused as hell. After diving deep into relationship psychology, attachment theory, Gottman's research, and way too many Esther Perel podcasts, I realised most relationship advice is either toxic masculinity BS or generic ""just communicate"" crap that doesn't actually help.

Here's the thing that blew my mind. Most relationship problems aren't about being a bad person. They're about operating on outdated scripts we learned from movies, our parents' dysfunctional marriages, or, honestly, just societal expectations that made sense in 1950 but are completely useless now. The dating landscape has changed, but nobody updated the manual. The good news is, once you understand the actual psychology behind healthy relationships, it becomes way more manageable.

Emotional availability isn't a weakness; it's literally the foundation.

This was hard for me to accept, but John Gottman's research (the guy who can predict divorce with 90% accuracy) found that the strongest predictor of relationship success is how you respond to ""bids for connection."" That's when she tells you about her day, shows you a funny meme, or complains about her coworker. Your reaction in those tiny moments matters way more than grand gestures. The book “Hold Me Tight” by Dr Sue Johnson completely changed how I understood this. She's a couples therapist who developed EFT (emotionally focused therapy), and this book breaks down attachment science in relationships. Basically, we're all just trying to feel secure and connected, and when that gets threatened, we spiral into toxic patterns. insanely good read if you want to understand the actual biology behind why relationships fail. This is the best relationship psychology book I've ever encountered.

Stop trying to fix everything immediately.

Guys especially fall into this trap. She's venting about work stress, and you immediately jump to solutions. She doesn't want that 90% of the time. She wants you to just fucking listen and validate that, yeah, her situation sucks. There's a podcast episode from “Where Should We Begin with Esther Perel” (season 2, episode about emotional labour) that explains this perfectly. Perel is a renowned psychotherapist who's worked with couples for decades, and she breaks down how men and women often speak different emotional languages. Sometimes the most helpful thing is just ""that sounds really frustrating"" instead of ""well, have you tried talking to your manager?""

Your mental health directly impacts the relationship.

You can't pour from an empty cup, and all that. When you're stressed, anxious, or depressed, you become reactive, withdrawn, or irritable. I started using “Ash” (mental health and relationship coaching app), and it genuinely helped me recognise patterns in how my mood affected how I showed up in the relationship. It's got exercises for managing anxiety, improving communication, and building emotional regulation skills. The relationship coach feature is surprisingly insightful for working through specific conflicts or understanding your attachment style.

There's also [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) an AI-powered learning app that pulls from relationship psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create personalised audio content. Built by a team from Columbia University, it's designed for building structured learning plans around specific goals, like becoming a better partner or understanding attachment styles in relationships. 

You can customise the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples from relationship experts. The voice options are actually pretty addictive; there's everything from calm and thoughtful to more energetic styles depending on your mood. What makes it different is the adaptive learning plan feature, you tell it your specific relationship goals or struggles, and it creates a structured path using relevant content from top sources. Worth checking out if you're serious about improving relationship skills beyond just random advice.

Create rituals of connection.

This comes from Gottman's work again. Successful couples have small daily rituals, such as morning coffee together, a specific way you greet each other after work, Sunday morning walks, whatever. These become anchors when life gets chaotic. They don't have to be elaborate. literally just consistent moments where you're both present and focused on each other. “The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work by John Gottman” is essential reading here. Gottman literally studied thousands of couples in his love lab and identified exactly what makes relationships succeed or fail. This book will make you question everything you think you know about what creates lasting love. best practical relationship advice backed by actual data.

Understand love languages, but don't use them as an excuse

yeah the five love languages thing is helpful for understanding how she receives love (words of affirmation, quality time, physical touch, acts of service, gifts). But don't be like ""well, my love language is physical touch, so I don't need to do romantic gestures."" That's lazy. learn to speak HER language even if it doesn't come naturally. growth happens outside comfort zones.

Conflict is inevitable and healthy if done right.

The goal isn't to fight. It's to fight productively. Gottman identified the ""four horsemen"" that predict relationship death: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling. avoid those. Instead of ""you never listen to me"", try ""I feel unheard when I'm talking, and you're on your phone."" See the difference? One attacks character, the other addresses specific behaviour. also repair attempts matter more than the fight itself. If you fuck up during an argument, acknowledge it immediately. ""hey that was shitty of me to say, I'm sorry.""

Maintain your own identity and encourage hers.

Codependency kills attraction. keep your hobbies, friendships, and personal goals. She should do the same. You're two whole people choosing to share a life, not two halves trying to become whole. There's a YouTube channel called “The School of Life” that has brilliant videos on this, especially their content about romanticism vs realism in relationships. They break down how our culture's obsession with ""you complete me"" narratives actually sabotages healthy relationships.

Physical intimacy extends beyond sex.

Non sexual touch, holding hands, hugs that last more than three seconds, cuddling while watching TV. These build oxytocin and maintain connection. also communication about sex is crucial. What she wants will evolve, what you want will evolve. keep that dialogue open without shame or judgment.

Be genuinely curious about her evolving self.

People change. The person she is now isn't who she was two years ago or who she'll be in five years. keep asking questions, stay curious about her thoughts, dreams, fears. One exercise that helped me was setting aside time monthly to ask each other deeper questions, like what's something you're afraid to tell me? What's a dream you've let go of? Where do you see yourself in five years?

Look, nobody's perfect at this. You'll mess up, she'll mess up. The goal is progress, not perfection. But understanding the actual psychology behind what makes relationships work instead of just guessing puts you way ahead.

1qfz9ct,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfz9ct,MP Obscura Files: Midori ‘Coffee break’,"Midori is perhaps best known for their Traveller’s series of fancy notebooks and brass pens, but in the past they occasionally released interesting stationery lines like their ‘CL’ series and the super flat ‘Slimmy’ pencil in the 1980s. 

I came across this seemingly one-off on Mercari and became fascinated by its design. The pinstripe grooved body is all-metal, which gives it a very nice weight and tactile feel. The key appeal for me was the clip, which sports the engraved text for ‘Midori Japan’, ‘Coffee break’ and a super cute emoji-like ‘CB’ logo rendered in a handscript-style ‘C |8’. 

I paid too much for it and although it arrived immaculately packed in bubble wrap, the resin clutch squealed and failed on the first press. This ‘technological arthritis’ has plagued many cool designs from the late 80s and early 90s, so although I was dismayed, I was also familiar with possible solutions. 

The easiest fix was if another pencil used the same guts and you just did a 1-to-1 swap. I had done this with some Zebra pencils using the guts from the plentiful M301. However for the Midori, I couldn’t find a good alternative. So the next option was surgery to transplant a metal clutch. 

After examining several possible donors I settled on the also-plentiful Pilot H325/S3. The metal clutch was of a similar diameter but was a couple mm taller than the original. So in the end I had to cut off some of the original plastic clutch housing to make room for the Pilot clutch. I was careful to leave enough plastic threads so that the cone could still screw on securely. 

Everything works now and I can go for a real coffee break! ☕️",7,1768711755.0,mechanicalpencils,1,0.9,False
1qfz8hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qfz8hr/the_house_needs_to_be_fed/,The House Needs to be Fed,"**Part 1: She keeps talking in her sleep**

Hi. This is my first reddit post, and I’m looking for someone that can help me. Has anyone heard of Juniper Bed and Breakfast in South Mississippi. It was my grandmother’s, and I’m looking for information about it. Mostly, I’m just worried. Strange things keep happening here, and I was hoping that one of you would be able to help. You may be wondering how I got here. I’d love to tell you that it is a whirlwind adventure and somehow, I found out that I’m a millionaire, but that is far from the truth.

I guess that I’ll just start at the beginning. I was driving home, listening to music, and trying to decompress after a long and tiring day. The back roads were empty, and the shadows were growing longer as the sunlight faded. I left the clinic in a hurry, wanting to plop down onto my couch and bask in the luxurious silence of an empty apartment. However, that monotonous drive was interrupted when I received a call from Taylor General Hospital. I figured it was another call to schedule one of my grandmother’s appointments. They could never get her to answer her own phone, so it didn’t surprise me.

“Is this Ms. Clifton’s granddaughter, Carrie? You were her emergency contact on file,” said the employee.

It was not the regular chipper girl who called about scheduling. This wasn’t concerning an appointment at all, and I felt a nervous tinge in the back of my head.

“I am,” I replied, feeling a lump forming in my throat.

“My name is Trina. I’m a nurse at Taylor General Hospital. Your grandmother collapsed after leaving her check-up appointment today.”

That conversation changed everything. I drove three hours to Taylor General Hospital in rural Mississippi to discover that my grandmother had suffered a debilitating stroke, and she would need around the clock care. Life can change quickly, and I certainly was unprepared. But I don't think anyone is.

You may be wondering why I was her only emergency contact, but the answer is simple. She raised me, and she is my paternal grandmother. That’s all there is to it. We’ve always had each other since my parents didn’t hang around long enough to see me grow up. My mother found drugs, and my dad… well I know he’s dead. How he died is still a mystery, and no one has seen my mom in twelve years. I suspect that she is dead as well. Through it all, I’ve always had my grandmother. She has always been the one constant in my life, and now, I’m losing her as well. But people don’t live forever, even if we wish they could.

I am now her caregiver. I moved back to my hometown, Juniper, and I’m not so sure that I’m going to stay after she passes. I thought about hiring someone to live with her, but I decided that I could manage on my own. I’m a nurse by trade, so I’m able to do most of the dirty work by myself. I change her, feed her, and bathe her. She’s on hospice now, and the hospice nurse comes by almost everyday to check on us. She’s a sweet woman with perfectly straightened hair and big brown eyes. She always asks me if I’m doing okay, and I always give her the generic “I’m doing fine.” The truth is… watching someone die is draining, and it isn’t like you imagine it. It is quiet, empty, and it has a certain kind of smell. It is a sharp scent, and it doesn’t leave your nose no matter where you go.

My grandmother can’t talk anymore. She mumbles something here and there while she sleeps, and when she wakes up, she stares at the wall. She’s only a feeble shell of who she used to be. The light in her eyes is somewhere else, dulled by her medicine and poisoned by her stroke.

Since I’ve moved back into my childhood home, all I do is clean. I turn on the tv for my grandmother if she is awake, and I get right to it. The house was a wreck when I came back two days before she was supposed to leave the hospital. Apparently, things were not as good as she led me to believe. I had only been away for a year since I finished nursing school and bought my own apartment. Of course, she couldn’t tell me anything now, but from what I can gather… she’d developed some interesting new habits. She’d started hoarding boxes, old cartons, wicker baskets, ill-fitting clothes, and silk flowers. There were bags upon bags of silk flowers, stacked to the ceiling like skyscrapers. I didn’t know that one could purchase so many silk flowers, and I thought I might die after a mountain of them fell on me. I was able to clear a pathway through to the main dining room where her hospice bed was set up, and I’ve been going through room after room and just throwing away and pillaging through her hoard. I bag it up, take it outside, and burn it. None of it is sentimental, and it is all garbage to me. She wasn’t living alone either. She’d picked up some little woodland friends… mice… rats… and from the skeletons I found in one of the bedrooms, I’d a say a family of squirrels was massacred by an avalanche of wicker baskets and boxes.

I just don’t understand. Why did she hide her ailing mental state from me? How could she live like this? She used to be a clean freak. She’d wash a porcelain sink four times until it shined. I should have come back sooner. I’d planned to come this Christmas since I wasn’t scheduled to work. I feel like a failure.

Her house used to be a beautiful bed and breakfast that everyone used to love to stay at. There are six guest bedrooms, and a master suite that always served as our main living space. It takes up the entire top floor of the house. It has its own kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom area. When I was little, I used to sleep with her on the master bed with my favorite stuffed animal. Now, the entire master suite serves as a graveyard for her mounds of trash, decaying woodland friends, and junk. I considered hiring someone to go through this absolute trash heap, but instead, I use it as my therapy. Throwing away the trash, burning it, and taking care of my grandmother gets me through the day. I’m exhausted, but it is better than feeling the horrible ache of grief swelling through my body like a balloon. I’d rather collapse on the couch and pass out than feel a single tinge of bitter sadness creeping up on me. It is easier to push it all away than actually cope. I’m sure that you probably understand… or maybe you don’t, and I’m assuming too much.

The night before my grandmother died she started talking in her sleep very loudly. It was so loud that she woke me up as I laid on the couch beside her bed. Usually she slept soundly, but the last few nights she kept trying to get up. She’d groan and try to lift her body, but that is sometimes a side effect of the morphine, a jarring restlessness. And tonight, it was disturbing pieces and parts of words as she attempted to rise again.

“Gram,” I said, slowly getting up and rubbing my eyes. “Do you need something?”

Her mouth was moving up and down, but no words were coming out. It was just hushed whispers of vowels and consonants. You could hear her tongue and teeth clacking together as she tried to produce audible sounds again. The left side of her face still had a visible droop, and a nasally whistle came through her nose as her poor failing body struggled to speak to me.

I took a deep breath, rubbing through her hair. “Gram, do you want some water?”

She nodded, and I grabbed her cup and her straw. I placed the straw into her mouth, and she swallowed quickly. She smacked her lips together and went back to sleep. I called my friend, Anna, who is a hospice nurse, and she answered, knowing that it was important if I was calling her so late.

“Carrie,” she said quietly. “John is sleeping, so let me leave our bedroom. Are you okay?”

“She keeps talking in her sleep. Is that normal?”

Anna sighed. “Yeah. It is normal with the sleep aids that she is taking. But I asked if you were okay. Are you?”

I sat back down on the couch. “You know that I’m not, but who would be in this situation?”

“Carrie… It is hard. You can call me to talk any time. Do you need help? I can make the drive to you.”

“No,” I replied quickly. “Anna it is such a mess here. I’ve been able to clean out most of the lower level of the house, but the master suite is a nightmare. Besides, I wouldn’t be okay letting you sleep on the other old couch.”

Anna chuckled. “You let me know if you change your mind, okay?”

“I will. Now go on back to bed. You’ve got work tomorrow. Sorry that I woke you up.”

“It’s fine. Goodnight,” she said in a whisper.

“Goodnight.”

I ended the call and sat back into the couch. The room was dark, but moonlight poured in from the windows. I was able to see, so I wasn’t concerned. I titled my head back, and I looked up at the ceiling, watching the shadows of tree branches thumping together as the wind blew outside. A stray branch scraped against the side of the house, and I jumped. I sighed and made a mental note to cut the damn crepe myrtles outside. They had grown wild, sprouting more branches than I had ever seen. They didn’t resemble the perfect pink puff balls along the house that I once remembered. The entire house was no longer the blissful country home that I once remembered. Like my grandmother… it was now only an empty shell of what would have been a once loving home for everyone who needed a warm bed.

I heard a sharp intake of breath, and I turned my gaze back to my grandmother. She began to mumble again. I inched closer to her, smelling the rancid odor of her breath. I knew that smell. It was the smell that only dying people emit. I knew that her time was coming. I leaned my ear closer to her mouth, and I was able to make out three words.

“Feed… the… house.”

“What?” I asked nervously. I held tightly onto the metal rung of her hospice bed. “What do you mean?” My words came out shakily, and I leaned even closer to her.

“The house… needs to be… fed.”

She suddenly grabbed my hand, and her other arm flailed as she tried to grab my hair. Her fingers grazed my cheek, and I tried to pry her hand off of mine. Her fingernails dug into my skin, and her knuckles burned white in the darkness of the room. Her eyes were wide, staring upwards at the ceiling… seeing something that I simply couldn’t. I couldn’t move. I was horrified. I had seen patients die, but none of them looked like this. She looked… scared. Her lips quivered, shaking the little amount of flesh that covered her facial bones. I couldn’t quite decide what she saw, but I was sure that I never wanted to see it either. I was able to rip my hand from her grasp, and I looked down to see purple whelps forming on my skin. She had grabbed me with inhumane strength, and I didn’t understand. Maybe I wouldn’t ever.

One thing was for certain. She wanted her house fed, and I wasn’t sure what that meant.

She died the next day in the early hours. I knew it was coming, and I hated that she left me with such a horrific memory. The funeral was three days later on a Friday. I still had bruises and little red crescent moons from her fingernails on my hand. Everyone in my hometown came. It was the busiest funeral that I had ever witnessed. The mayor came with his wife, and they made what felt like an extreme effort to learn my future plans for my grandmother’s house. The sheriff and his wife came. Old classmates and their parents. It was insane in my opinion. She didn’t know half of these people, and I surely didn’t know them either.

One of my grandmother’s frequent guests at the bed and breakfast came up to me and gave his condolences. He was an older man with greying hair and a thin grey mustache. “You plannin’ to stay here and clean up the place? I think the bed and breakfast deserves a second chance. It has been run by the Clifton family since this town was founded.”

My mouth went dry. “I haven’t really thought that much into it. I’m a nurse, so I figure that I’ll have to sell it.”

His face turned a hot shade of red. “You can’t do that! You don’t know what you are doing. What would your grandmother say?” Spittle shot from his mouth as he continued to fuss. “You simply can’t sell it.”

I stared at him, trying to decide why it bothered him so much. People turned to look at him, hearing his loud voice over the conversations around them. I decided to give him an answer to placate him since I didn’t want him yelling at me during the visitation.

“Mr. Havers… I haven’t made any decisions yet,” I replied lowly. “I’d appreciate it if you’d lower your voice as well. People are staring.”

He looked around, and he smiled. He straightened his suit. “Good… You need to think of Juniper. You are now one of the founding members since your grandmother has passed. It is your responsibility to keep this town thriving. I’m sure that you’ll make the right choice.”

He left quickly, nearly knocking someone over as he hurried away. Everyone stared at him as he left, but they did not seem as shocked as I was. He had always been nice to my grandmother.

I felt my cheeks burn and tears welling up. I forced them down, and I looked around, hoping to spot someone I knew. I needed someone to take my mind off of Mr. Havers. One of the police officers who had come walked to check on me. He looked familiar, but I couldn’t remember how I knew him.

“Are you okay, Carrie?” he asked. He was a younger man with reddish hair and hazel eyes.

“I’m fine. Everyone is acting so crazy today. I just don’t understand,” I whispered.

He shrugged. “Funerals make everyone crazy. My name is Phillip. You might remember me from school. I moved away, but I got a job here when I finished police academy.”

I nodded, remembering the geeky kid who moved away when we were freshman. “Phillip Masterson,” I said, frowning. “Layton Meyers used to pick on you really bad. I remember you. I’m sorry I didn’t intervene to help you.”

“No worries… No one wanted to stand up to him.” Phillip smiled. “Now Layton Meyers is a drunkard and lost his drivers license, so I think I’m safe for now.” He chuckled.

He sat down beside me, drinking a cup of lemonade from the refreshment table. “When did you get back?” he asked.

“About three weeks ago.”

“I started working here about a month ago, so what have you been doing?” he asked, trying to be friendly.

 “I’ve been cleaning out my grandmother’s house and taking care of her. She let it fall into ruin, and truthfully, the whole thing needs to bulldozed.”

I looked out at the crowd of people. They were socializing like this was a family event. “I don’t understand how all of these people are here for the funeral, but no one went over there to check on her. Surely, she had friends who cared enough to drop by. Assholes...” I stopped myself. “I’m sorry. That was mean to say.”

He took a deep breath. “Mean or not… it is the truth. So many people used to go to your grandmother’s bed and breakfast, and the town grew because her incredible gardens brought tourists. I think it’s a shame that none of them bothered to check in on her while you were gone.”

I looked up at him, grateful to have someone who seemed to understand. He stood up, preparing to leave, but I stopped him.

“Phillip, what do you know about the bed and breakfast? My grandmother told me some strange stuff when she was lucid.”

He looked taken aback. “I don't know much,"" he whispered. ""I can grab some records from city hall and bring them by tomorrow. I can also help you clean. I’m off tomorrow if you’d like some help and some company.”

I nodded. “I’d like that very much.”

He smiled. “I’ll bring coffee.” He walked off and headed out the door of the funeral home.

After the funeral ended and she was lowered into her grave, I drove back to my grandmother’s house all alone. I stared out the window, thumbing over the steering wheel. I suddenly noticed how much larger Juniper had grown since I left. Yet the people who had always lived here still remained. I was the only one that seemed to escape. Everywhere around us is farmland and large expanses of thick woods, so Juniper is the only place that many come to for other necessities or entertainment. They finally built a movie theatre, and the old mall closed down. But they were expanding. I could see the shell of new homes and new buildings sprouting up everywhere, and it made me wonder why they were so keen on preserving the now rotting bed and breakfast. I couldn’t help but think about Mr. Havers.

He must know something.

I’m sure of it, and maybe we find out together.

Light candles. Write love notes. Plan surprise dates. But here's what nobody talks about: forcing romantic gestures when you don't feel them creates more distance than doing nothing at all.

I've spent months digging through research, podcasts, and books from relationship experts trying to figure out why some couples stay connected while others drift apart. What I found surprised me. The spark doesn't die because you stop being romantic. It dies because you stop being real

Here's what actually works.

Stop performing, start connecting

The best relationships aren't built on grand gestures. They're built on small, genuine moments of attention.

Ask better questions: Instead of ""how was your day?"", try ""what's been on your mind lately?"" Real intimacy comes from curiosity, not routine check-ins.

Share what scares you: Vulnerability creates connection faster than any planned date night. Talk about your insecurities, your fears, your weird thoughts at 3am.

Touch without agenda:Hold hands while watching TV. Hug for an extra few seconds. Physical connection shouldn't only happen when you want sex.

Dr. John Gottman's research (he predicted divorce with 94% accuracy) shows that couples who stay together aren't more romantic. They're more responsive. They turn toward each other instead of away. Small stuff. Consistent stuff.

Understand your actual love language

Everyone talks about the five love languages, but most people misuse them. Gary Chapman's book ""The 5 Love Languages"" (sold over 20 million copies) isn't about what YOU prefer. It's about learning what makes your partner feel loved, even if it seems weird to you.

Here's the thing: your partner might feel most loved when you unload the dishwasher (acts of service) while you're over here planning elaborate date nights (quality time). You're both trying, but missing each other completely.

Figure out what actually lands. Then do that. Even if it feels less ""romantic"" to you.

Create rituals, not routines

There's a huge difference. Routines are things you do on autopilot. Rituals are intentional.

Morning coffee together:Even just 10 minutes before the chaos starts. No phones. Just talking or sitting in comfortable silence.

Weekly check-ins:Sounds corporate, but it works. What's going well? What needs attention? Where do you both want to grow?

Shared hobbies:Do something together that isn't Netflix. Cook a new recipe. Take a class. Build something. Novelty releases dopamine, the same chemical that floods your brain when relationships are new.

The podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"" by Esther Perel breaks down real couple's therapy sessions. One thing becomes clear: couples who maintain spark don't have perfect relationships. They have \*engaged\* ones. They stay curious about each other.

Get comfortable with desire fluctuation

Here's what killed me: thinking something was wrong because we weren't always hot for each other. Turns out, that's biology.

""Come As You Are"" by Emily Nagoski (one of the best books on desire I've ever read, backed by actual research) explains that desire isn't constant. It has accelerators and brakes. Stress, exhaustion, feeling disconnected, these are brakes. Feeling seen, rested, playful, accelerators.

Most people think they need to manufacture desire. Wrong. You need to remove the brakes first.

Talk about it: ""I miss feeling close to you"" is vulnerable and real. ""Why don't you want me anymore?"" creates defensiveness.

Lower the stakes: Not every intimate moment needs to be movie-worthy. Sometimes it's awkward or funny or just okay. That's normal.

Get out of your head:Use the app Paired for daily questions that spark real conversation. Sounds simple but it works. 

For anyone serious about deepening their relationship understanding, there's an AI-powered learning app called BeFreed that pulls insights from relationship psychology books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content. You can ask it to focus on specific challenges like ""maintaining intimacy as an introvert"" or ""balancing autonomy and closeness,"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan around your unique situation. The depth is customizable, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly good, I went with the smooth, conversational tone that doesn't feel like a robot lecturing you. It's been useful for connecting dots between different relationship frameworks without having to read ten separate books.

Accept the messy middle

Every long term relationship hits phases where you feel more like roommates than lovers. This doesn't mean it's over. It means you're in the messy middle where real intimacy is built.

The spark you're chasing from early relationship days? That was mostly neurochemicals. What you build now is deeper. It's choosing each other when it's not easy or exciting. It's laughing at inside jokes nobody else gets. It's knowing someone's patterns so well you can tell they're off before they say anything.

""Mating in Captivity"" by Esther Perel (relationship therapist with 30+ years experience) argues that the real challenge isn't keeping passion alive. It's balancing intimacy with autonomy. You need both closeness AND separateness. The couples who maintain desire give each other space to be individuals, not just halves of a whole.

Stop comparing

Social media makes everyone else's relationship look effortless. It's not. Behind every cute couple post are arguments about whose turn it is to take out the trash and difficult conversations about money.

Your relationship doesn't need to look like anyone else's. It needs to feel good to the two people in it.

The work isn't about forcing romance. It's about showing up authentically, staying curious, and choosing connection over comfort. Some days that looks like deep conversations. Other days it's just remembering to buy their favorite snacks at the store.

\- I would prefer the fridge to be on the opposite side (closest to the dining area). BUT I would like to do a wide  hood which doesn't allow for the fridge to fit at the end, any ideas how to tweak it w/o giving up the hood aesthetic? Right now I have the range with 2' of workspace on each side.

Preface

I’m 29M AA and started dating 29F AA on 11/9/25. We had mutual friends and had been texting on/off since June 2025 but kept missing each other, I’m pretty laid back so I shrugged it off. 

Month 1

We met for the first date for coffee and we instantly hit it off, both healthcare professionals, went to school in the same general area. We met a second time on 11/16 for ice cream and had a good time again, we’re still getting to know each other but we’re hitting it off. The next week we both had engagements on 11/22 but we met up after and had a nice time. The next week was her birthday, she forewarned me she may be late getting ready so on 11/28 I booked 3 dinner reservations. She was ultimately late (her hair appt ran late) so I waited and we made the later reservation. On 11/30 (her actual birthday) she called me last minute to go to a happy hour and meet her friends, I went and that was a decent time. A few days later I told her I would prefer not be late if possible bc sone of my family members consistently run late and it makes me feel like they don’t care about my time. She was receptive, we continued on. 

Month 2

On 12/6 we both had to leave (me for a work party, her for a friends trip) so we hung out during the week. On 12/13 we were supposed to go on a date, 

Conflict 1

however after l got off work I told her I have to cancel because I’m going to do something with my dad, but we could re schedule for the following week. This is a turning point in our relationship as from this point on she references this day as the day when I showed her I don’t care about her.  I apologize and she explains that she’s very upset and hurt. She has a brunch scheduled with friends the next day and it snowed that morning so I offer to drive her so she won’t have to worry about the roads, she’s not fully receptive but she lets me drive her and we’re able to talk. By Monday she seems to be back to somewhat normal. We hang out during the week and I leave for Hawaii with my family (mom, dad and sister) from 12/20 - 12/30. She expresses to me that she’ll spend Christmas alone and she’ll be sad. 

Conflict 2

I get back around 2pm and have to drop my sister off at the house for her telework and shower/unpack and she wants me to come over. I tell her that’s fine but I have to do some things first, it’s getting late around 7pm she asks if I could’ve done these things (shower, unpack, go to Walmart) at another time because she’s waiting on me. I tell her no I just got back and was on the plane for hours. She wants me to pick up her food and bring it to her and I tell her I’m really running around she’s at her house she could pick up the food herself instead of giving me more things to do. She says this is another time when I showed I didn’t care about her. I explain to her how much stuff I had to do and that I had to return to work the next morning. Ultimately it was a small hiccup and we continued on. 

Month 3

We had an awesome time on NYE. We went to multiple parties her friends invited her to and I meshed well with everyone. 

Conflict 3

We planned to go see wicked 2 on 1/3, however there were limited showtimes so she asked me earlier that day if we could just buy it on tv and watch at home. I say yes that’s fine after I get off work we can do dinner then watch the movie at home. She then she’s going for drinks with friends first, I say okay. Her going for drinks runs late around 1130 and she asks me to just come see her at the house after. I do so and I tell her she canceled on me the same way, she flips it she says she didn’t cancel because it wasn’t a date because we were gonna watch the movie at home. I tell her she asked to do that so in retrospect that seems like it was a trick question. She deflects but ultimately agrees that she canceled because she wanted to go for drinks. We don’t talk the following Monday, she contacts me Tuesday and says she doesn’t like me going the day without speaking to her and it makes her anxious, I explain to her that after conflict I need time to process things. 

Conflict 4 

The week from 1/5-1/10 I’m sick with COVID and we don’t see each other. We’re talking on the phone on 1/12 and somehow we start talking about men and women in healthcare professions and she raises her voice saying the reason I matriculated the way I did was because of patriarchy and because I’m a man. I was taken aback because she never raised her voice with me and I generally don’t like that. I also thought we were just having a dialogue. The next day goes by and we don’t speak as I’m taking my time after she yelled at me. She calls me the next morning and yells at me some more saying she cannot go without hearing from me because that makes her anxious. She also says I didn’t ask about her day or her presentation so I don’t care about her then she hung up the phone. On 1/15 I text her telling her I don’t know if it’s working out I don’t like people yelling at me (I unfortunately did this on her sorority’s founders day). We met up yesterday and she said doing that on her founders day made her visibly sad at the festivities and showed I don’t care about her. I explained to her that I’m not into sorority/fraternity I was just communicating how I feel. 

Postface 

Generally I like her. We had good experiences but the relationship is still new.

The Rejected Luna Returns

Chapter 1
Ten years after being cast out by my family, my mate, and my pack, I met my former Alpha mate and brother by adoption in a small town.

After all these years apart, one had become a decorated Alpha warrior, the other a high-ranking Alpha—and I was just running a tiny coffee shop.

The moment our eyes met, both men froze for a long time.

Then Adrian hid the pregnancy test in his hand behind his back, and Mike slipped the jewelry he'd bought for his sister into his pocket.

I lowered my gaze, packed up the cake and coffee, and handed them over politely.

""Here you are, Alphas.""

The overly distant address made both of them falter for a second.

As they pushed open the door to leave, Adrian suddenly turned around and asked,

""You said you'd never bake desserts again for the rest of your life, didn't you?""

I smiled politely. ""Just something foolish I said in anger.""

The sound of children laughing and playing outside drifted in faintly through the glass door, but it couldn't break the stagnation inside the shop.

The two Alphas who'd teamed up to have me cast out from the pack all those years ago still stood at the cash register, refusing to leave.

Adrian clutched the box of macarons and coffee, his throat worked,

""Eden's having bad morning sickness. We're bringing her to stay south of the pack for a while.""

""Your mother… came with us too.""

""Would you like to see her?""

I shook my head as I wiped the counter. ""No need. Give my regards to Luna Juliet.""

Pausing, I added, ""Or don't mention it at all—better to avoid misunderstandings.""

My foster brother Mike's knuckles whitened as he tightened his grip,

""Hazel, all these years we—""

""Hazel!""

A girl with dyed green hair bounced through the door, threw her arms around mine, and shook me, ""I'm starving!""

A genuine smile finally spread across my face as I tapped her nose, ""There's your favorite chocolate chip cookie in the fridge.""

""Noooo,"" Isla whined, ""Hazel, eat with me.""

I glanced helplessly at the two men, my smile fading: ""Alphas, your cake and coffee are ready.""

Adrian's gaze flickered when he heard ""chocolate chip cookie.""

Mike stared blankly at Isla's lively figure, the rest of his words died on his lips.

I took Isla's hand and walked into the back kitchen, the automatic door sliding shut to cut off their view.

When I emerged again, the shop was empty.

Isla mumbled around her fork: ""Hazel, do you know those two Alphas? They were looking at you weird.""

""When they arrived, I saw a whole entourage—warriors and everything.""

""I heard one's a famous Alpha warrior across all packs, and the other's a respected Alpha.""

I kept my head down as I sorted through receipts. ""Here, they're just customers.""

""If I really knew people like that,"" I poked her forehead gently, ""would I be waking up early every day to bake you cakes and cookies?""

Isla giggled, leaning in to whisper in my ear:

""Word is that Alpha warrior's Luna is that other Alpha's sister—they came all the way here for her to rest during her pregnancy. It must be wonderful to be so cherished.""

I nodded calmly, tossing a used piping bag into the trash can.

Of course I knew how much they spoiled Eden.

After all, ten years ago—

One had had me committed to a werewolf psychiatric hospital on our mating ceremony night, branding me a laughingstock, a madwoman.

The other had announced my death to the pack and personally driven me out into exile.

Together, they'd shattered me completely and cast mee into a living hell.

I had a few interactions with him last semester, all of which were friendly, and it always felt like he was on the brink of asking me to hang out, get coffee with him or the like but always got nervous and stopped short of actually asking. I'm pretty socially awkward myself and would also get nervous before I actually was able to ask him. I'm also more traditional and generally just tend to believe that men should be the ones who do the approaching/asking out etc so I decided to just wait for him to ask me out (while also starting conversations with him and doing what I thought was clearly giving him signs that I was interested). 

The semester ended and he never ended up asking me, and now this new semester we're in a class together again. I haven't talked to him yet this year because for whatever reason now he seems like he is avoiding me/going out of his way not to sit near me or start conversations with me.

Hannah is sat on the couch in her own damn apartment, and Charlie who doesn’t even live there is standing in front of her yelling at her demanding her to read her own diary entry out loud to him like he’s her dad and he’s grounding her. Marnie is standing behind her, enabling her boyfriend’s loser ass behavior, and also so pissed at Hannah and telling her to just read it to him and do what he says. 

I remember being in my 20’s and putting up with situations similar to this, and my friends putting up with similar shit from me. Tolerating audacious, immature, shit-ass behavior from your friends boyfriends who are objectively wrong and out of pocket in every aspect of the bullshit that unfolds, but rolling your eyes and complying anyway because you love your bestie so much, and you hope in her heart that she’ll cool off and come to her senses eventually and stop subjecting you to being a third wheel to the rusty crumbling tricycle that is their relationship. 

Anyway, Hannah reads them the same entry he just read out loud to every confused drunk person at the bar in Brooklyn, to which Charlie huffs and puffs and acts surprised like he didn’t have it memorized already. He then says he wishes he never found it but he did, making himself the victim of his own invasion of a woman’s privacy. 

Marnie tries to explain how this isn’t even her journal so she doesn’t understand why Charlie is so mad at her. Charlie starts screaming about why would Hannah lie about her feelings in a journal, because men who are stupid and don’t have any good points will often raise their voice to scare the women they are screaming at into shutting up. Marnie then starts yelling at Hannah about why Hannah would want the whole world to know about her relationship by writing it in her journal, which makes literally no sense but it’s because Marnie just got yelled at by a scary man who looks like American History X, so she has to take out her feelings of frustration on the only other person in the room who isn’t being scary on purpose. 

Charlie then says that he deserves honesty and respect because he is an important part of the community that is Hannah and Marnie’s apartment. He is able to make this demand for respect because he has never been held accountable to the consequences of his own actions before, so therefore he is able to overlook the fact that he just invaded his girlfriends best friends private diary and read it out loud in public to a room full of strangers in order to start problems on purpose, and is incapable of seeing how that’s not very respectable. 

To then prove how much he deserves the respect he demands, he flips Hannah and Marnie’s coffee table, knocking all the shit off it, steals it and stomps out of the apartment. Marnie begs him to stay because she has Stockholm syndrome and familiar suffering is more comfortable than the unknown. Marnie is still fucking pissed at Hannah and Hannah doesn’t seem to really care. 

The next day, Marnie and Hannah are eating cereal in their kitchen. Marnie is talking about her plans to win Charlie back and how Hannah caused real damage and may have ruined her and Charlie’s relationship. Hannah says she didn’t even leave her notebook out for anyone to just waltz in and read, so Charlie found it by snooping through her shit and invading her privacy which is a crime. Marnie says that’s too bad because Hannah wrote mean stuff about her and Charlie’s relationship. Oh my god dude. I’ve had so many conversations just like this. I’ve ended so many friendships over conversations just like this because the density, denial, and deflection just becomes too much for me. I’m honestly not as patient of a person as Hannah is being. Watching this scene honestly made me feel like I was getting repeatedly catheterized. 

Jessa and Hannah are both dressed like grandmas but from states on opposite coasts (Jessa Seattle /cali … Hannah Boston probably… just watch the episode you’ll see what I mean) They are talking about Hannah’s boss touching all the ladies at work, to which Jessa says she should be flattered. Jessa then says she should fuck her boss “for the story,” to which Hannah says she can’t because Adam is her boyfriend now, which is breaking news to everyone in the world including Adam probably. She said that because Adam told her to be herself that that means they’re basically together now. 

Marnie shows up at rays coffee shop looking… honestly gorgeous I love this outfit, hair, make up combo on her. Ray starts being annoying to a customer so he doesn’t have to make eye contact with Marnie after participating in ruining her life the night before. Ray tells Marnie he doesn’t like what she’s about, because she broke Charlie’s heart. Which is so crazy because I don’t remember Marnie actually doing anything to participate in this bullshit whatsoever. Ray then says he’s probably more in love with Charlie than Marnie is. 

It is then revealed that Marnie came to Rays job to ask for Charlie’s address. Which is…. I don’t know what to say about that. I don’t know what there is to be said about a long-term relationship, where one side of the couple is obviously emotionally checked out and exhausted, and the other part of that couple is invading every single aspect of their partners life, to the point of committing literal crimes against loved ones in their partners close circle… and then? Keep his own personal space completely off limits to that same partner? For YEARS? To the point she doesn’t even know where he lives? He has invaded every aspect of her life and taken complete control, but has also given himself the freedom and opportunity to scurry away and not be found or held accountable like a little rodent. It feels almost by design. 

ANYWAY, Ray seems just as shocked as I am that Marnie has never been to Charlie’s fucking apartment, so he gives her the address and then tells Marnie that he wouldn’t even hate-fuck her before she leaves. 

Hannah is at work and her boss Rich, pats her on her butt again. 

Marnie is navigating a sketchy part of the city in 6inch stilettos trying to find Charlie’s apartment. He buzzes her in and she is amazed that his apartment is so chic and organized. Charlie is wearing a cardigan over a flannel and pouting and whining about how he always told Marnie to come over to his place but she never did. She insists that he never invited her over, and he said that he definitely did, and then she says that it’s not exactly easy for her to get here from work anyway, because why not fight about something new I guess? Marnie says it doesn’t matter because he never sleeps there and he’s always at her place anyway, to which he says he will be staying there now because they are broken up. 

Jessa is at her babysitting family’s house putting make up on for a date, Jeff is giving her instructions for the night, but gets distracted by her ethereal beauty and pauses to compliment her. Jessa says she is meeting up with her ex who is in town visiting, but doesn’t know why he wants to meet up because he dumped her. Jeff seems shocked that anyone would dump Jessa, because that’s how old married guys make their move I guess. JFPAR comes in and seems to feel like she interrupted something, which Jessa notices and feels uncomfortable and promptly takes the cue to leave. 

Charlie and Marnie are sat at the breakfast booth thing in Charlie’s apartment. The apartment would actually be such a slay if it belonged to an Asian girl in undergrad and not this gross guy. Marnie and Charlie are looking down with their hands folded in front of them, like they are mourning the loss of something great, which they are not. Charlie says they are only together because of sunk cost fallacy. 

The next scene cuts to a flashback several years in the past, of Marnie and Hannah and Jessa in college at a basement party. Marnie has bangs and a little headband and she looks soooo cute and dorky and really pretty!!! Jessa is wearing rainbow suspenders and Hannah pretty much looks the same. Marnie is having a panic attack because she ate a pot brownie with a Jell-O shot on top, to which Jessa goes to find one to eat herself. Elijah enters the scene and is just as gay as when we first met him many years after this, but is dating Hannah and embraces her. Hannah tells Elijah that Marnie is having a panic attack because she ate pot brownies. A gay little song comes on at the party, to which Hannah and Elijah leave panicking Marnie alone to go dance and have fun, even tho she begs them not to because she’s so scared. Elijah grabs his friend Charlie to come watch Marnie so he and Hannah can go have fun. This is the very first time Marnie and Charlie ever meet each other. Marnie tells Charlie that she’s scared, and asks him for a hug, which he gives her and makes her feel better. He tries to invite her to see his band later, but she’s so high that she just asks him to keep hugging her. 

We cut back to the present, where Marnie and Charlie are at the table in his apartment. Charlie mentions how Marnie’s bangs that she had at the time reminded him of a girl he saw in a porn once, and he watched it that same night to see if it actually was her in the porn. Marnie is shocked to hear that Charlie watches porn. She says that instead of porn, he should just imagine the two of them having sex. Charlie says that that makes him sadder than watching porn. 

Hannah enters Rich’s office with some files he asked for. He starts giving Hannah his sandwich order for lunch, and Hannah tells him to just fuck her already. Rich looks really shocked and appalled. Hannah tells him she thought it was a gross idea at first, but now she’s down and wants to fuck him and get it over with. Rich says that he’s married and they work together, and that Hannah is speaking to him very inappropriately. Hannah says that she’s not trying to trap him and insists he act on his fantasy. Rich starts hysterically laughing, and when Hannah gets pissed off and defensive, asks what Hannah’s problem is and if she is on drugs. Hannah says that her, and her other female coworkers could sue him for touching them. Rich says that Hannah can barely make it into her 10:am shifts, so she doesn’t have the discipline or drive needed to be able to even file a lawsuit against someone. Hannah says she’s quitting for sexual reasons and she won’t sue if Rich writes her a check for $1000. Rich is laughing the entire time. He proceeds to ask her not to quit, and insists that she’s great, despite not knowing her job, and also trying to fuck him, sue him, and extort him. She tells him she’s going to write an essay about him where she won’t change his name and then he can sue her, and then she leaves. 

Back at fucking Charlie’s apartment with the moron brigade, Marnie and Charlie are arguing about whether or not they love each other. Charlie says it doesn’t matter if he loves Marnie, because he already decided Marnie is the one for him and he is committed to her. Which is interesting because he seems to REALLY need Marnie to love him and be in love with him, so good thing he doesn’t hold himself to that same expectation of giving love? Anyway he says something about how he likes how Marnie’s hair smells and that’s enough for him to not crave the thrill of fucking other women, then gets pissed and stomps off. But it’s a studio apartment so he just stomps to the other corner of the room. 

Marnie is desperate at this point for reasons unbeknownst to me, but starts begging and pleading for him to stay with her and saying she will do anything so that he won’t leave… including replying to his sister, kicking Hannah out of her apartment, moving into his apartment, giving him head. She is so desperate for him to not leave her that she starts crying, and a horrible shitty smirk spreads across Charlie’s face. Idk if you can tell by the way I’m writing about him? But I hate him so much lol. 

Jessa is walking in the park with her ex who is wearing a vest and a fedora. You truly hate to see it. He is kind of hot. I love that she’s wearing Uggs with her outfit. Anyway, her fedora ex immediately tells her that they won’t be having sex with each other, because he’s moving in with his girlfriend next month. That’s one way that this show is so real… name one dude you knew in your 20’s who wasn’t fucking trifling. Fedora ex accuses Jessa of being jealous of his new girlfriend, to which Jessa retorts that she wouldn’t be jealous of a girl whose boyfriend is flying out to meet up with his ex. Look… I know Jessa is a mess but she’s funny. Marnie and Hannah sit by and let Charlie scream at them and flip their table, only to follow up the next day and beg to suck his dick? Like at least Jessa calls gross behavior for what it is to their face. 

Anyway, fedora ex proceeds to ramble about how beautiful, interesting, and cool Jessa is despite their tumultuous relationship. Then proceeds to insist how much he loves his current girlfriend, before the scene cuts to them making out passionately in Jessas apartment. Unbeknownst to either of them, Shoshanna is home and hears them aggressively hooking up and hides so I guess she doesn’t interrupt or something. 

They throw each other on the bed and undress, and fedora ex fucks Jessa out the window from behind and cums almost instantaneously. As they get dressed, he goes to kiss her and she pulls away, insisting he loves his current girlfriend after all. Shosh laughs from her hiding spot, and Jessa accuses her of being a peeping perv. Jessa tells Shosh that what she just witnessed was an example of Jessa being unsmotable. 

Adam has goggles and a torch lighter for undisclosed reasons, when a knock at the door interrupts him. Hannah comes in, and Adam says she needs to let him know before she just shows up whenever she wants because he’s busy right now. Ignoring what he just said because she’s thinking about herself, Hannah tells Adam she just quit her job, to which Adam says he thought she already did that because he didn’t know she got a different job. Hannah starts feeling Adam up, to which he recoils from her touch and asks what she’s doing. He says that they just discussed yesterday how their situationship isn’t good for Hannah’s mental health and how they should end things, but Hannah is confused because they had sex after that. Adam says that these things usually stop when someone stops having fun, and Hannah isn’t having fun right now, so he doesn’t see why they should continue to see each other. Hannah tells Adam that she tried to fuck her boss today, but she isn’t sure if it was because she wanted to be an asshole, or if it was for the story. 

Marnie is straddling Charlie in his bed which is very close to the ceiling. She’s trying to have make up sex with him, but he keeps interrupting her to make sure she agrees to the additional terms and conditions he’s tacking onto their relationship. Like not making him feel insecure and be nice to his friends and take him seriously. Idk how anyone could be aroused in the face of such patheticness. 

Hannah starts to leave Adam’s apartment but sees him masturbating, to which she asks him if he knows that she’s still there and hasn’t left yet. He says he knows, and asks her to stay until he finishes, for the story. 

Marnie is on top of Charlie riding his dick while he insists that she can’t abandon him because it reminds him of his dad.

 I had to pause this scene for a while to decide if I’d rather watch a video of someone getting beheaded. I decided that a graphic video depicting a real violent death would probably make me feel just as bad as this particular scene does, and kept watching. But I cannot stress enough how sick to my stomach it makes me lol. 

Anyway Marnie is on top of Charlie and is shown trying to fuck him, not hit her head on his low ceiling, and carry the emotional burden he is also trying to unload onto her while she’s doing all of this. He grabs her face to kiss her and look at her face closely while he lays there unmoving, contributing nothing, and talking about the expectations he has on her in their relationship from here on out. Charlie tells her he loves her repeatedly while demanding extremely close eye contact, which Marnie realizes she is unable to say back to him. She physically recoils from him and hits her head on his low-ass ceiling, finally knocking some goddamn sense into herself. Charlie senses her sudden onset of critical thinking, and like the invader he is, attempts to pull her in close and reassure her that he is there and that she is okay. Marnie says she wants to break up, to which Charlie collapses in defeat. 

Adam is jerking off in front of Hannah. It’s gross, weird, hot, intimate, charming, funny, and comforting all at once. It’s easy to see why Hannah would fixate on someone like Adam. He’s a very interesting part of her story, regardless of the suffering he causes her. He’s into some weird sexual shit Hannah hasn’t experienced before, and he makes her feel comfortable rather than bashful to explore that part of herself with him, which differs from how bashful she feels with him emotionally!! She takes a dominant role in watching him masturbate, demanding money for a cab and snacks, and taking a $100 bill out of his drawer and making him apologize will he jerks off. Adam cums furiously when Hannah yells at him, making her feel like she has more control of their situationship than she had earlier in the episode. ",8,1768710769.0,girls,1,1.0,False

i realised the other day how hard i truly fell. i’m giddy to see him, excited as hell as i climb into his car. i can’t help but smile when he texts me and i’ve even been baking for him. today we went on a coffee date in the morning and went to (attempt) some clothes shopping (for him). he was telling me afterwards that he normally hates shopping for clothes, especially alone, but i made it more enjoyable. he said he really liked having me join him, and i made it much less anxiety inducing. he asked if i’d be down to go grocery shopping with him, just to be there with him, and i said yes.

we’ve never had the “what are we?” talk but this doesn’t feel casual to me. he told me he missed me, and honestly he has the last few times we’ve hung out as we only see each other once a week now. we hang out pretty consistently, we talk every day, and neither of us are on dating apps anymore. i’m only talking to him, i have no idea if he’s talking to anyone else. he said he didn’t match and talk to many girls on hinge even before we met.

i want him to like me, and honestly i don’t care how slowly we move, i just want to start moving in a direction. i want to rip the bandaid off and bring up the conversation but i’m so terrified of rejection, so terrified of making him uncomfortable. i don’t think he likes me for one specific reason: we don’t kiss.

we have kissed, though. it’s rare, but it happens. i don’t know if he views kissing as something too intimate as we’ve hooked up plenty of times (although not every time we hang out). maybe it’s just me but if you liked a girl, wouldn’t you want to kiss her? we cuddle, he’s affectionate other than that, but we rarely kiss.

i really like him. i just hope he likes me too.",1,1768710673.0,relationships_advice,2,1.0,False

1qfytiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qfytiz/bring_it_on/,Bring It On,"Ok I know I am going to get completely lambasted on this subject, but please help me understand. I’ve been drinking coffee since I was 16, that’s a long time ago! I love it! But I love medium and dark roast beans because I love strong, rich, nutty, flavorful coffee. I’m getting away from the darker roasts as my tastes change with this hobby. Not knowing any better, I only used to drink drip coffee from a Bunn, Mr. Coffee, Cuisinart, then Keurig, then Moccamaster, then Chemex pour overs, then a Jura (which I returned) V60, Breville Precision, Kalita, etc etc etc. y you get the picture. I have two fairly decent grinders-a Turin DM47 and a Baratza Virtuoso. I know there’s plenty more grinders way above mine in terms of producing great coffee. Here’s where I get confused-what am I missing with the light roasts? I went to a cupping one time and hated all of them. They were thin and tasted more like tea to me. I don’t understand the concept of looking for flavor profiles such as peach, strawberry, lemon, rose, tea, etc when drinking coffee. I really want to learn more about this, but after that cupping, I just don’t get it. I also understand that where I went could have just sucked, but I’m genuinely curious about what more I could be missing. I want to learn more about this! If you’re just going to make fun of me, that won’t be helpful for me. I’m honestly trying to learn. TIA! ",2,1768710425.0,pourover,4,0.75,False

1qfyt4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/1qfyt4h/advice_for_renters_w_power_out/,advice for renters w power out?,"we live in a small apartment building (but it’s part of a big one, just spread out horizontally) w 4 units and earlier this morning, our unit’s power went out. we had our big main heater going and our smaller “personal” one in the bedroom. but when my wife turned on the small coffee machine, the breaker blew 🫩 we’ve had both heaters on w the xbox on before, so idk what happened

anyways, towards the middle of 2025, management decided to lock the door to the basement w our breakers and water heaters. there’s a full on lock on the door (bc someone kicked in the door before without it), so we weren’t able to kick the power back on.

i called the emergency maintenance phone number (bc it was 15° outside) and AI answered me. i explained the situation, AI told me they had no information under my name, but then assured me that an appointment would be made. this was at 11 am. we took a nap later, woke up at 3 pm, and unsurprisingly, the power was not back on. so i called the emergency phone number again, and the AI lady told me the same thing. i made her (it?) confirm that the maintenance request was for TODAY, and AI confirmed it. it’s 10 pm and im still lighting up the room with my phone’s flashlight.

google told me that it’s not illegal in kansas to lock a breaker from tenants UNLESS they can be sure to turn the power back on in a “reasonable amount of time.” it’s been almost 12 hrs and it was fucking freezing today…

obviously, we live in shitty apartments bc of our financial status, so we can’t take legal actions against management. however, bc no one came today, i’m assuming we won’t get our power back on until monday morning, when all the office workers r back in their office after their lovely, warm weekend.

my father-in-law offered to break the lock so we could access the basement, but im scared of management taking legal action on \*us\* for trespassing.

any advice? thankfully, it looks like tomorrow is going to be warmer than today, but this is still fucking inhumane.

1qfyr8y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfyr8y,"A take on a Evil Race, and monsters as a whole.","So first i gotta explain how I came up with this... idea/question? This will basically be my thoughts to inspire discussion and work as a prompt.

I had a thought about Minecraft, mainly with Plilagers/that whole pale grey people, alongside the simple game mechanism of things just... spawning in, like yea its just a game mechanism sure, but when you have a device in game that just spawns them in... it implies that creatures can just pop into existence, and when they die they just... vanish into dust ig?

First part will be related to the idea of a Evil Race (a evil sentient species) and the other part will be more the general implications of creatures being able to simply manifest into reality, and developing like Pokémon evolution as this is applied video game logic?

So, here is my premise. One day, these people start appearing out of swirling smoke and ash. While they can talk, do the things people do, and generally are very much just people, when they encounter humans, they just attack. No anger, no aggression, they dont even know WHY why do it, why they kill humans... they just do. if you were to call them on the phone, conversation is just fine, no issues, but unless they train themselves otherwise... its on sight basically. 

It works for giant spiders, undead, strange floating monsters, and so on, but the fact they are in so many ways just... people, yet still do that same ""human hunting"" behavior is so fascinating. 

Especially if its a thing of they also can have kids, maybe its summoning a child, or the old fashioned way, but the fact they can just appear in a coffee shop or in the middle of nowhere is so scary.

Going more broadly to monsters, a giant spider, 20 foot tall giant, or a ghost just popping out of thin air is fascinating, because how do you defend against that? youd need rapid response teams if a fucking dragon appears in a middle school. Youd have to design public spaces to be able to be easily locked down. When all it takes is 1 zombie to create a outbreak, when a giant spiders reproduction instantly(well kinda instant, at least from conception they pop into juveniles) creates fully viable creatture that will be a adult... thats like, a fucking outbreak of giant spiders. Lets say half of them eat eachother for food to evolve like a Pokémon into adulthood, thats still a small army just appearing from one creature.

Especially when these monsters are actively hostile? Yea people are cooked, unless these are in localized or predictable spots that you can build around, or make a city have a low chance of a monster appearing... I dont know how a world would adapt around.

So... what monster type would be the worst? id say a beholder, something with that much destructive power just appearing would be horrific. For defenses... man, id build open spaces like castles or how we build US schools honestly. ",58,1768710237.0,worldbuilding,38,0.88,False
