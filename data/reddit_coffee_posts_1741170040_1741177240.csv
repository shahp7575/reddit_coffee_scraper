(Before you come in here and say that something may be wrong medically, he has been to 3 different vets just in case and received a clean bill of health from all of them)","I got my husky puppy when he was 10 weeks old. I had the help of a trainer shortly after I got him to assist in things like recall, resource guarding, socialization, leash manners, crate training, etc. Everything  went great and he has become a great dog in that regard.

My problem now is that as of the time he turned ~10 months until now (he is 14 months) all he does is whine/cry and it continues to get worse. My trainer has told me to simply ignore it, but it is getting impossible. 

He cries/whines when my alarm goes off in the morning until I get out of bed. When I get out of bed to go to the bathroom, he sits at the bathroom door and continues whining. When I am downstairs getting my morning coffee ready, he cries at the back door until we go for our hour long morning walk. When we get back from our walk, he cries/whines because he wanted the walk to be longer. He cries/whines when I am getting his breakfast ready. It happens when I come home from work for our hour long lunchtime walk because I was gone and when I am getting him ready for the lunch time walk. It happens when I get home from work for the day. If I sit on the couch too long to relax after work, he starts again because he wants another walk. When we get back from our afternoon walk, guess what, he is whining because he is bored in the house. He whines more when I am getting his dinner ready, after his dinner because he is bored, if I don't play with him long enough, if I get up to leave the room he follows me around the house doing it, before and after his evening walk, when I am in the shower, and when I am getting ready for bed.

It seems like if he is awake, he is whining/crying the ENTIRE time. I have tried ignoring it, I have tried addressing it, NOTHING seems to work. My significant other has repeatedly said to get another dog for him, but I refuse to get another dog to address a problem with my current dog. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Does it get better/is it because he is still young? Any tips on how to minimize the whining/crying? I am really starting to get fed up because all it does is stress me out!",1,1741177002.0,dogs,1,1.0,False
1j41pde,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1j41pde/i_feel_observed_and_unfree_in_my_own_home_and/,I feel observed and unfree in my own home and don't know who is overreacting,"

Okay so this just happened and I am genuinely not sure if we both communicated shitty or if either of us is overreacting.

The bigger picture: my husband and I struggled for a while as a couple, tried to work on it though. He used to use Darvo on me until I pointed it out to him, now he is trying to work on it. 
I for my part often don't communicate clearly, been working on that too. 

Some context from my perspective: The other day I saw a reel of a woman saying that you're not fine in your relationship (or are not in the place where you belong, something like that) if you don't feel peaceful and calm in your own home. 
And it struck me that I rarely do. I have a lot of internal stress and anxiety, and that's on me. I am the one who has to deal with that. 
I also realized though that I try to be ""inconspicuous"" around my husband and drop everything when he enters the room. 
I will put my phone down or stop the TV or just turn to him from whatever I am doing at that moment. And most days it's fine, I like to interact with him. I realized though that I always do this, even if I would like to keep watching or reading or whatever, because he is EXPECTING IT. 
Because I know that my husband would not like it if I not immediately establish contact if we happen to be in the same space. 
I can't just mind my own business and peacefully coexist. 

So I was getting all in my head about this and thought, well maybe it's just in my head, and I could do whatever I want without it being a big deal. 
So I did today. 
And it backfired. 

We were in the kitchen this morning, I was eating breakfast, he had a coffee. We were just sitting there, we had talked before, but weren't anymore, so I thought I could take my phone and look at it. 
He immediately got up, visibly annoyed and left the room. 

And now just an hour ago we were in the same spot again, I was reading and having a snack and I didn't drop my book like I use to when he entered. He sat there for a while, watching me intently. 

Then this conversion happened and I will just type it out and if you could please tell me what you think about it. 
I am at a loss, truly. 

Husband asked:

""is something up? You ignore me and seem annoyed"" 

""Well I am a bit, to be honest. I am feeling watched and like I can't do what I like to do cause you observe me and give me feedback on every change in my mood. It's stressful.""

""whoa you don't need to make a general thing out of it, I was just asking how you are, cause you are sitting there avoiding me, not making eye contact and you seem annoyed"" 

Me: ""Yeah that's exactly what I mean, I would just like to sit here and read, and not having my mood and everything else analysed. It's like I can't ever be just in a bad mood or just not being that chatty or just do what I want even though we are in the same room and I don't like it. So yes I am annoyed. ""

""Why are you being so aggressive? I just wanted to know what's wrong and you're making this big deal out of it, you know what, I can't do that, I am going.""

And he stormed out, slamming doors on his way. 

I'm so confused.
It's me, isn't it? I should have better communicated and not make a general thing out of it. ",1,1741176887.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

Try Me Out, No Strings Attached!","Hey, you! Yes, you...scrolling through Reddit looking for something to spice up your day. Stop right here, because I might just be your next obsession!

I’m a 21 yr old curious guy, single and ready to mingle (or just chat....your call!). Think of me as your limited time offer: a chill, curious dude who’s all about good vibes, great chats, and maybe a little playful trouble. Here’s what you’re getting:The Basics (Because You’re Curious):

* **Model**: Indian (Brown)
* **Gender**: Male
* **Age**: 21
* **Status**: Single and way too excited to meet you!

# Features & Specs (The Fun Stuff):

* **Hair**: Dark, short, and perfectly tousled for that “I woke up like this” vibe. Bonus: It gets extra messy when I’m deep in thought...or distracted by you.
* **Eyes**: Brown, bright, and always sparkling...except pre coffee, when they’re still flirting with the idea of waking up.
* **Height**: A solid 5'8"" tall enough to grab stuff off the top shelf, short enough to slide right into your cuddle zone.
* **Personality**: Your chill, curious sidekick who’s always down for a laugh. I’ll listen to your wildest dreams, then hit you with a goofy joke to keep it light. Shy at first, but once I’m in, I’m all in...think goofy, thoughtful, and ready for anything.

# Special Skills (Why You’ll Keep Me Around):

* I can cook a meal that’ll make you smile (not just instant noodles...I’ve got range!).
* I memorize song lyrics like a champ, so expect random serenades at 2 a.m.
* Meme game? Elite. I’ll send you the perfect one to brighten your day, or make you snort laugh.

# Fueled By:

* Books, music, and those late night thoughts that hit different.

# Hobbies (Let’s Bond Over These):

I’m into books that make you think, walks that turn into adventures, and chats that stretch into the early hours. I’m here to explore minds, hearts, and maybe a little more if the sparks fly.

# Likes (What I’m Craving):

* Chats that vibe like your favorite playlist.
* Spontaneous “why not?” adventures.
* Swapping songs or debating Netflix’s latest banger.
* Trying new things, especially if “you” are one of them.

# Dislikes (Let’s Avoid These):

* Ghosting (just say it if I’m not your vibe, I can handle it!).
* Chats as dull as a Monday morning (let’s keep it spicy!).
* Awkward silences, though I’ll probably break them with a random fact or a terrible pun.

# Availability (I’m Flexible for You):

Up for late night talks that turn into sunrise confessions, movie nights where we fight over popcorn supremacy, and new experiences we’ll laugh about later. Let’s keep it fun, real, and 100% us.Flaws (Keeping It Real):

* A little shy at first, but give me a sec, I’m worth the wait.
* Curiosity overload, I might ask too many questions (it’s because you’re fascinating!).
* I overthink sometimes, but only because I want this to be good.

# Price (Best Deal Around):

Totally free for chats, laughs, and a sprinkle of flirtation. If we vibe, we’ll figure out the rest together...no pressure, just possibilities.

# Perfect Match (Is It You?):

You...if you’re open minded, kind, and ready to dive into something new. Extra points if you’ve got a book rec, love a deep convo, or can suggest a wild idea I haven’t tried yet.

# Your Move:

So, what are you waiting for? Slide into my DMs for a flirty, fun ride with a guy who’s all about keeping it real. Let’s see where this takes us.....I’m game if you are!",1,1741176853.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I’m not agreeing with this. AITAH?,"Throwaway account

I am currently ‘exclusively dating’ a guy. We both agreed that we are not going to date other people, and in this stage, we want to know each other more. I genuinely like this guy.

Currently, he’s on a trip overseas whilst I can’t join him. This trip was planned before we met, and I couldn’t make arrangements to join him. We have been going around-and-around on the topic that I will not be comfortable if he would purposefully make plans to meet/have coffee/do activities with another girl, and it’ll be just the two of them. He’s saying that it is okay because it’ll be based on friendship and if it gets flirty, he’d stop. I said, I am not comfortable with it. He said that it’d be my fault if I feel uncomfortable because it shows lack of trust. He also encouraged me to ask my other friends, preferably who are from western culture (I am Asian) because in his eyes, my perspective is wrong. 

On the other hand, for me this is not normal. I’m okay if he’d meet friends along that way. But to go and make plans with another girl and it will just be the two of them? It’s a no for me.

I need outside perspective.

They planned to move in together next month, which is a big deal because Kate has struggled with financial impulsivity for years. Growing up, she racked up credit card debt buying designer clothes, concert tickets and otehr ridiculous spends like getting fancy cars on finance, and while she’s gotten better, she still occasionally overspends.

Last week, Kate casually mentioned to me that she hadn’t told Mark about the £15k in credit card debt she’s carrying. She said, “It’s not his business yet. I’ll tell him after we’re settled in the new place—he’ll understand.” I asked if she was actively paying it off, and she admitted she’d only made minimum payments for the last year. Considering she also has student loan debt to continue paying off this was exteremely worrying.

I panicked. Mark is very uptight —he budgets obsessively and even delayed proposing until he’d saved enough for a ring in cash (which was a big deal for him). I worried if he found out later, it’d destroy their trust. So, I invited Mark for coffee and told him everything, emphasizing that Kate was trying to improve but thought he deserved to know before possibly merging finances.

Mark was really upset. I found out he confronted Kate and a messy argument had broke out. Kate called me screaming that I’d “sabotaged her” and accused me of always treating her like a “irresponsible child.” She says Mark now wants to postpone the move-in and possibly the wedding.

Our parents are split: Dad says I had done the right thing, and I had a moral duty to warn Mark, while Mom says I violated Kate’s privacy and should’ve encouraged her to come clean herself. Even my partner thinks I overstepped, saying, “You’re not her keeper.”

I feel guilty for blindsiding Kate, but I truly thought I was protecting both of them. AITA?",11,1741176384.0,AmItheAsshole,15,0.87,False

Ideally means something ideal for you. You could say, ideally I'd have liked coffee, ideally I'd have said something. Here, she's using it with something she hates. How do you ideally hate something? She should have instead said 'ideally I'd have liked evening flights' or to go with the fact that she hates early morning flights, 'generally/usually I hate early morning flights'. 

The PS portion: 'is what was' is quite awkward. She could have said 'This song was running in my head' AND 'while both happened ' sounds grammatically incomplete. It should have been 'while both were happening'.

I quit coffee around 2 weeks ago or so, and I got a severe depression with a lot of existential angst and burnout. I am barely able to eat too without puking, but it has gotten a bit better. I've had a cup or two of coffee with milk everyday for around 10 years. I had to replace the coffee with green tea since it was getting out of hand. Immediately I felt mentally better. I am thinking of continuing drinking green tea with a bit of lemon, since it has both caffeine and L-Theanine, but of course less caffeine than coffee. My relationship and home situation is getting a bit out hand too, because I'm relied on to help out, but I barely can do stuff anymore. I'm trying light theraphy as well since the weather out is really grey. I'm scared of driving since I'm not as alert as before as well.

Are you a front-row overachiever, a mid-row observer, or a back-row ghost? Maybe you’re the near-the-exit escape artist or one of the mysterious students who never shows up at all.

Whether you're furiously taking notes, secretly scrolling your phone, or perfecting your eye-roll technique, your spot in class says *everything* about you.

So, be honest—**where do you sit?** And do you *really* think it doesn’t say something about you?

**Front Row: The Overachievers**

* **Eager Beavers** – Always take notes, ask questions, and probably highlight their textbooks in five different colors.
* **Grade Grinders** – Already know the answer but still ask, just to flex.
* **""Is This on the Exam?"" Warriors** – Live for the syllabus and will remind the professor about homework.
* **The Show-Offs** – Not only do they answer every question, but they also throw in *extra* knowledge to impress the professor.
* **The Undercover Slackers** – Sitting in the front row to look engaged but secretly texting under the desk.



**Second Row: The Almost-Tryhards**

* **The Hopefuls** – Want to be great students but can't resist scrolling their phones occasionally.
* **Sleeper Agents** – Genuinely want to learn but hit an energy wall around 20 minutes into class.
* **The Over-Caffeinated** – Running on their fourth cup of coffee, scribbling notes furiously while their leg shakes uncontrollably.
* **The Peer Reviewers** – Constantly whispering to their friends about the lecture and low-key correcting them.



**Mid-Center: The Balanced Ones**

* **The ""Let's See How This Goes"" Crew** – Not too close, not too far. Probably paying attention but won’t raise their hand unless called.
* **Group Project Survivors** – Here for attendance, waiting for someone else to start the discussion.
* **The Class Clowns** – Making snarky comments under their breath, causing laughter while staying just under the professor’s radar.
* **The Quiet MVPs** – Actually the smartest ones in class but never speak unless absolutely necessary.



**Nearest Exit: The Commitment-Phobes**

* **Last-Minute Runners** – Sit here for the ability to vanish before Q&A starts.
* **The Early Escape Artists** – Eyes on the clock, one foot out the door at all times.
* **The Backpack Half-Zippers** – Already packed up 10 minutes before class ends, ready for takeoff.
* **The Bathroom Breakers** – Disappear for half the lecture and return mysteriously right before attendance is called.



**Against the Wall: The Lone Wolves**

* **""Do Not Perceive Me"" Types** – Introverts who prefer being invisible and wish they could attend via hologram.
* **The Cynical Scholars** – Think they’re too smart for the class but still show up (begrudgingly). Roll their eyes at obvious questions, group activities, and any mention of “participation points.”
* **The AirPod Scholars** – One earbud in, one out. Are they listening to the lecture or their playlist? No one knows.
* **The Seat Claimers** – Arrive early to get their specific seat and will **never** sit anywhere else.



**Back Row: The Ghost Students**

* **The Disengaged Dwellers** – Here in body, absent in spirit. Probably rethinking life choices.
* **The “Why Am I Even Here?” Crew** – Signed up for the class, but still haven’t figured out why.
* **The Silent Protesters** – Refuse to take part in discussions out of principle.
* **The Seat Warmers** – Show up just to meet attendance requirements, then zone out.
* **The Hoodie Hermits** – Hood up, head down, avoiding eye contact at all costs.
* **The Desk Nappers** – Head down, hoodie up, fully committed to their mid-class power nap.



**Bonus: The Middle-Row Phone Zombies**

* **The Secret Scrollers** – Mastered the art of looking at their lap and nodding occasionally to seem engaged.
* **The Social Media Managers** – Using class time to check notifications, reply to DMs, and post a ""busy studying"" selfie.
* **The Multitaskers** – Switching between the lecture slides and a group chat about weekend plans.



**The Missing Students: The Ones Who Never Show Up**

Not all students pick a seat—some prefer to **disappear entirely.** Whether they’re strategic about it or just plain MIA, here are the students who exist **in theory, but not in class.**

* **The Ghost Enrollees** – Their name is on the roster, but no one has ever seen them. A true **urban legend** of the classroom.
* **The Strategic Skippers** – Show up *only* on attendance days, midterms, and finals. Somehow still pass.
* **The Email Warriors** – Never in class, but always in the professor’s inbox with an excuse and a request for “notes from today.”
* **The Study Group Leeches** – Will never attend a lecture, but **miraculously appear** when it’s time to join a group project or review before the exam.

I leave for work at 7am and come home at 6pm. In this time lately I'm trying to do at least 7k steps and when I come home sometimes I have time and energy for Pilates or Yoga, sometimes not. I also went to the gym for about 2 months lately but I don't always have time when I come home and put it on hold for home pilates. 

In the morning I usually drink a coffee and try to drink a smoothie, but often I can't eat anything. 

At 12 we have a lunch break and I usually try to prep something at home (I love big salads with delicious dressings but they don't seem to keep me full, but also pasta, potatoes, leftovers from the day before). 

When I get home I start making food and by the time I am done I am STARVING. I usually make food for my bf and I (we also work together but he is much more active than me), I eat a smaller portion but can't always control myself, I feel like this is my biggest problem. 

My question is, what can I do to control my intake more, as I loove eating home. I hate eating out or when I am rushed (as I am at lunch when I have 30m but I like to take breaks when I eat). 
A few years ago I had a job where I didn't always eat during the day but only at night. Now that would be ok, but I fear that eating that late would do more harm as I would be eating more? 

I eat at 7-8 when I go to sleep at 10-11 and can't be bothered to do anything physical between eating and sleeping. If I eat a BIG lunch I say I won't eat anything at home but still get hungry. 

Is there a way that someone sees how I can portion my meals and carbs/protein/fats intake so that I don't feel the need to eat so much?

The only thing that carried me through the days where I had heartfelt gratitude towards my Creator has been food and coffee. I cannot even pray without falling into negativity simply for coming face to face with the One who allows all this in the world, I have much negativity against the way things work. Reading the bible fills me with more sorrow than joy.

First off, let's talk about why you even need a VPN when using public WiFi:

* **Unencrypted networks**: Most public WiFi networks don't encrypt traffic, meaning anyone can see what you're doing
* **Man-in-the-middle attacks**: Hackers can create fake hotspots with names like ""Starbucks Free WiFi"" to steal your info
* **Data theft**: Without protection, your passwords, credit card info, and personal files are up for grabs
* **Session hijacking**: Bad guys can take over your active online sessions and access your accounts

A good VPN creates an encrypted tunnel for your data, making it impossible for hackers to read your information even on unsecured networks.

# Top 5 Free VPNs for Public WiFi in 2025

After testing more than 150 VPNs, I've narrowed down the best free options for staying safe on public WiFi. Each one offers decent security features without the usual annoying limits that make most free VPNs basically useless.

# 1. ProtonVPN Free - Unlimited Data with Solid Security

ProtonVPN interface

**Pros:**

* Unlimited data (rare for a free VPN)
* Created by CERN scientists who know encryption
* No-logs policy actually verified
* Kill switch included even on free version
* AES 256-bit encryption and DNS leak protection

**Cons:**

* Only 3 server locations (US, Netherlands, Japan)
* Can be slow during peak hours
* Only 1 device connection at a time
* No streaming support on free plan

ProtonVPN stands out because it was developed by security experts who also created ProtonMail, the world's leading encrypted email service. Their free plan doesn't put any caps on your data usage, which is super rare for free VPNs.

When I tested ProtonVPN at my local library's WiFi, it automatically protected my connection and passed all leak tests. The kill switch feature worked perfectly - when I switched servers, it disabled my internet until a secure connection was reestablished.

While you only get access to servers in three countries, the security features are identical to their premium plan. The only real downside is speed - I got about 31.5 Mbps on local servers, which is enough for browsing and standard video, but not great for HD streaming.

# 2. Hide .me Free - Strong Security Features

Hide .me interface

**Pros:**

* 10GB data monthly
* No registration required to use the app
* AES 256-bit encryption and automatic kill switch
* DNS/IP/WebRTC leak protection
* 5 server locations
* 24/7 live chat support (rare for free VPNs)

**Cons:**

* 10GB monthly data limit
* Can't unblock Netflix or other major streaming services
* Just 1 device connection

Hide. me offers impressive security for a free VPN. Their no-registration policy means you can download and start using the app without creating an account, which is great for privacy.

During my tests at a coffee shop, hide. me delivered speeds around 23.4 Mbps, which is fast enough for most online activities. What I really liked was how it protected against session hijacking - a common threat on public WiFi where hackers try to take over your active sessions.

The 10GB data limit is enough for everyday browsing, email checking, and some YouTube videos, but you'll hit the cap pretty quick if you try to stream a lot of content.

# 3. Avira Phantom VPN - Good Leak Protection

Avira Phantom VPN interface

**Pros:**

* Strong leak protection (prevents DNS, IP, and WebRTC leaks)
* 500MB monthly data (1GB if you register with email)
* AES 256-bit encryption
* Clean, simple interface
* No registration required
* Unlimited simultaneous connections

**Cons:**

* Very limited data allowance
* No kill switch on free version
* Only connects to the ""nearest location""
* No customer support for free users

Avira Phantom VPN comes from Avira, a trusted name in antivirus software. Their free VPN focuses on the basics - keeping your connection secure on public WiFi without any bells and whistles.

In my tests at a busy cafe, Avira delivered decent speeds around 36.7 Mbps. Its leak protection worked flawlessly - important because DNS and IP leaks can expose your real identity and location even when using a VPN.

The biggest drawback is the tight data cap - 500MB won't last long with modern internet usage. You can double it to 1GB by registering with your email, but that's still pretty restrictive. However, if you just need occasional protection for checking email or banking on public WiFi, it's a solid option.

# 4. PrivadoVPN - Best Free Option for Streaming

PrivadoVPN interface

**Pros:**

* 10GB high-speed data monthly, then unlimited at reduced speeds
* Can unblock some streaming services
* Kill switch included
* Split tunneling feature
* Servers in 10 locations
* AES-256 encryption

**Cons:**

* Speeds throttled after 10GB
* Limited server selection compared to premium options
* Some advanced features restricted

PrivadoVPN has become one of the better free options recently. What makes it stand out is that after you use up your 10GB of high-speed data, you can continue using the VPN at reduced speeds instead of being cut off completely.

When testing at an airport lounge, I was impressed that PrivadoVPN could actually unblock some streaming services - something most free VPNs struggle with. The speeds were decent too, around 42 Mbps on nearby servers.

The free version includes both a kill switch and split tunneling, letting you choose which apps go through the VPN and which don't - helpful for saving data while still protecting sensitive activities.

# 5. CyberGhost (Free Trial) - Premium Features for Limited Time

CyberGhost interface

**Pros:**

* 24-hour free trial with all premium features
* Automatic WiFi protection
* 45-day money-back guarantee if you subscribe
* 7 simultaneous device connections
* Excellent speeds
* Huge server network (7,700+ servers)

**Cons:**

* Not truly free (just a trial)
* Requires payment info for trial
* Only lasts 24 hours

While not permanently free, CyberGhost's 24-hour trial gives you complete access to one of the best premium VPNs. If you need top-tier protection for a day of intensive public WiFi use (like during a conference or travel day), this is your best bet.

CyberGhost's standout feature is its automatic WiFi protection, which instantly secures your connection when you join a public network. During my tests at the library, it connected automatically when I joined the network, so I never had to remember to turn it on.

With over 7,700 servers in 91 countries and speeds averaging 87 Mbps, performance is much better than truly free options. The trial requires payment info but can be canceled before charging.

# What Makes a Good Free VPN for Public WiFi?

When picking a free VPN specifically for public WiFi protection, look for these key features:

# Essential Security Features

* **Strong encryption**: Look for AES-256 encryption (military-grade) to make your data unreadable to hackers
* **Kill switch**: This cuts your internet if the VPN connection drops, preventing accidental exposure
* **Leak protection**: DNS and IP leak protection ensure your real identity isn't accidentally exposed
* **No-logs policy**: The VPN shouldn't keep records of your online activities
* **Clean from malware**: Many free VPNs are actually loaded with malware - stick to trusted providers

# Usability Factors

* **Adequate data allowance**: At least 500MB monthly for basic protection
* **Decent speeds**: Should not slow your connection to a crawl
* **User-friendly apps**: Easy to connect with one tap when joining public WiFi
* **Multiple device support**: Protects your phone, laptop, and tablet

# The Dangers of Truly Free VPNs

It's important to understand that most completely free VPNs come with serious drawbacks:

* **Data selling**: If they're not charging you, they're probably making money by collecting and selling your data
* **Poor security**: Many cut corners on encryption and security features
* **Malware risk**: Some free VPNs contain malicious code that can infect your device
* **Bandwidth limitations**: Severe data caps make them impractical for regular use
* **Slow speeds**: Free servers are often overcrowded, leading to terrible performance

The VPNs I've recommended above are either legitimately free with reasonable limitations or offer genuine free trials of premium services.

# Beyond VPNs: Additional Tips for Public WiFi Safety

A VPN is your first line of defense, but these extra precautions will give you maximum security:

* **Verify network names**: Always ask staff for the exact WiFi name to avoid connecting to fake hotspots
* **Use HTTPS websites**: Look for the padlock icon in your browser address bar
* **Enable two-factor authentication**: This provides an extra security layer for your accounts
* **Keep software updated**: Make sure your device has the latest security patches
* **Disable auto-connect**: Don't let your device join networks automatically
* **Turn off file sharing**: Disable this feature when on public networks
* **Use mobile data for sensitive tasks**: If possible, use your cellular connection instead of public WiFi for banking or shopping

# Common Questions About Free VPNs for Public WiFi

# Can I stream Netflix using a free VPN on public WiFi?

Most free VPNs can't unblock Netflix due to the streaming giant's sophisticated VPN detection. Even if they could, the data limitations would make it impractical. PrivadoVPN has some limited streaming capabilities, but for reliable Netflix access, you'd need a premium VPN.

# Are hotel WiFi networks safer than coffee shop WiFi?

Not really. Hotel WiFi networks have the same security issues as any other public WiFi. They're open networks that multiple people use, making them vulnerable to the same types of attacks. Always use a VPN regardless of where you're connecting.

# Can I use a free VPN for banking on public WiFi?

While a free VPN is better than no protection, I don't recommend using even the best free VPNs for banking or other highly sensitive activities on public WiFi. The security limitations and potential reliability issues make this risky. Either use a premium VPN with proven security or stick to your mobile data connection for banking.

# Will a free VPN slow down my connection?

Yes, all VPNs slow your connection somewhat because they encrypt your data and route it through their servers. Free VPNs typically cause more slowdown than premium ones because they have fewer servers that get overcrowded. Expect a 30-50% reduction in speed with most free VPNs.

# How do I know if a free VPN is leaking my information?

You can test for DNS, WebRTC, and IP leaks by using websites like ipleak.net or dnsleaktest.com while connected to your VPN. If these tests show your actual location or IP address, your VPN is leaking. All the VPNs I've recommended passed these leak tests during my evaluations.

# Premium VPNs with Free Trials Worth Considering

If you need more comprehensive protection, these premium VPNs offer risk-free trials:

* **ExpressVPN**: 30-day money-back guarantee, excellent speeds, top-tier security
* **NordVPN**: 30-day refund policy, specialized servers, advanced features
* **Surfshark**: 30-day money-back guarantee, unlimited device connections
* **CyberGhost**: 45-day refund window (longest in the industry)

Premium options provide better security, faster speeds, and unlimited data - plus they can unblock streaming sites and offer 24/7 support.

# The Bottom Line: Staying Safe on Public WiFi in 2025

Public WiFi networks are convenient but dangerous without proper protection. While free VPNs have limitations, they're infinitely better than browsing unprotected.

For occasional use, ProtonVPN Free stands out with its unlimited data and strong security background. If you need more features and can afford a few dollars monthly, consider a premium VPN with a money-back guarantee like ExpressVPN or NordVPN.

Whatever you choose, never connect to public WiFi without some form of protection. Your personal data is too valuable to leave exposed.

I'm new to the espresso world and have been exploring different options. I'm currently leaning towards either the Profitec GO or the Gaggia Classic E24, but I have some specific needs:

* **Look and space:** I need something small, i have limited space, also i like the estethics of these machines so if suggesting alternatives i would like them to be similar
* **Decaf Preference:** I drink a lot of decaf and would like to grind decaf beans to make quality espresso.
* **Pod Integration:** I'm considering using pods for my non-decaf coffee, so I could grind decaf beans while having pods for regular coffee. However, I'm not sure if this approach makes sense or if there's a better solution. The only pro i see on the E24 is that it specifically says it supports PODs on the specs
* **Hot Water:** i like the Profitec but the Gaggia has hot water, i think this could be useful, is there anything in between?

Has anyone had similar experiences or advice on which machine might be best and how to manage these requirements effectively? Which grinder would you start with since with the Profitec i would be out of budget quickly :)

Deepseek,"You're the over-caffeinated, visa-chasing, Step-score-obsessed underdogs of the Match. Let’s dive into the beautiful chaos of the quest to land a residency spot in a system that treats you like a spreadsheet cell.

**1. The Flex Masquerading as Humility** 

Literally every third post here: *“Guys, I only got a 260 on Step 1 and 10 publications… should I dual-apply to Pathology?”* Meanwhile, the comments section is just 300 IMGs side-eyeing their coffee-stained First Aid books, muttering, “*Only?*” Congrats, you’ve turned humblebragging into an Olympic sport.

2. **The “I’ll Take Literally Any Specialty” Energy** 

You started med school dreaming of neurosurgery, but after three Match cycles, you’re now Googling “Do Family Medicine programs accept Step 2 scores from 2019?” Your backup plan has backup plans. “Pathology? Sure! Psych? Why not! Undersea Hyperbaric Welding Medicine? *…Does it sponsor visas?*”

3. **The US Clinical Experience Grind**

You paid $5,000 to shadow a disinterested attending in a clinic where your main job was to nod and say, “Wow, hypertension is wild.” Meanwhile, your LORs all read: *“This student was… present.*

4*.* **The FAQ That Never Changes**

“Do program directors care if I blinked during my Zoom interview?” “Is it over if I misspelled ‘hemorrhage’ in MyERAS?” The subreddit’s search bar is weeping in the corner, ignored like a UWorld question you swear you’ve never seen before.

5. **Visa Status: The fourth Step**

“J-1 vs. H1-B” debates hit harder than your Step 1 prep. You’ve memorized immigration policy faster than Sketchy Micro, only to realize neither visa stops programs from ghosting you. “But what if I marry a U.S. citizen?” you joke… *unless*?

6. **The “I Have 300+ Applications” Flex**

You applied to every program in North America, including the one in a rural Alaska town where the nearest grocery store is a snowmobile ride away. “Do they take IMGs?” IDK, but your credit card sure took the $26 application fee.

7. **The Match Day Meltdown**

When the algorithm blesses an AMG who shadowed once in undergrad with a derm spot, while you’re over here with 270s, 10 pubs, and a decade of clinical experience… **SOAPing into a Prelim Surgery spot** where your job is to hold retractors and question your life choices.

8. **The “I’m 35 and Still a Med Student” Vibe**

Your classmates back home are department heads, and you’re still begging for a Sub-I in a state you can’t pronounce. “Age is just a number!” you say, while residency programs side-eye your graduation date like it’s a expired milk carton.

The Match process treats IMGs like a game of *Squid Game*, but with more debt and fewer fun outfits. Yet here you are, grinding, memeing, and refreshing eras.server till your fingers bleed. Respect. 🫡 (And good luck explaining “SOAP” to your parents for the 10th time.)

**In Conclusion**  
r/IMGreddit is the only place where “Keep calm and carry on” has been replaced by “Panic quietly and email 50 more programs.” But hey, at least you’re all in this together—a beautifully dysfunctional family united by a shared delusion that one day, *someone* will finally answer your LOI.

I can’t get over the mistake of leaving a good job in defence. Now I feel like I’m not where I want to be in life at 27.

I started in August, everything seemed great, but it wasn’t. My manager didn’t like me for some reason. I think I intimidated her, here’s why:

She asked for help with her PC, I tried to help her, she shooed me away with her hand when I couldn’t figure out the problem.

The co leader made a comment about my frizzy hair in the 2nd week of the job. I thought it was a joke so I let it slide. My colleague came back from outside with an umbrella in her hand, so I asked if it was raining, she said, no it’s drizzling, but I don’t want to get my hair frizzy. I said, neither do I. He said, but your hair is already frizzy. I said his name in a jokey way to show I couldn’t believe he said that. He said, but it’s true, it’s frizzy. 

I arranged lunch with him as one of my goals was to get to know my colleagues and he was one of the few people in the office. He came over to speak to me and said” I can’t understand a word you say, it’s hard to understand you because you don’t even open your mouth when you speak”. I couldn’t believe he said this! I was in shock and said I’ll try and speak better then he said you mustn’t change a thing. Really didn’t want to go to lunch but didn’t want to cancel on the co head of the department.

Came back from a meeting, the director asked how I found it, I said great and asked if I could ask some questions, he said sure! My manager rolled her eyes at him. 

Several things happened which made me think I wasn’t liked or fitted in. I’m the only woc there along with an Asian man. This isn’t an issue as I have been the only woc in my old job. Colleagues inviting everyone for coffee, so I went to, they seemed annoyed that I came and one guy actively avoided speaking to me. But in the office, he would speak to me.

Manager was sat next to me and asked my colleague if he had heard from me, he said not really, she said what on earth is wrong with her! I went to my car and cried.  She constantly vaped in the office and spoke to me in harsh tones but I let it slide because I was new and she was nice most of the time. 

My colleague who is my buddy had been ignoring my emails when I asked for a catch-up. The next day I left. I have a freelance job which earns more than that role but the job is not stable. I had a ftc in a finance job which ended in Feb. Now, I feel like I should have gone to hr to complain, stayed and played the game. A part of me thinks I made an impulsive choice to leave the next day. 

I told myself to never work in that area again, as I had a job there before where I left the next day due to my racist colleague whose mum ran the senior department. The first day he shouted at me down the phone for not being able to find him in the car park, I froze. He also said” my manager has no power really, his mum is more senior”. 

However, I really needed a new job as my old one was laying everyone off. Something told me not to go into defence because I had moral issues. 

How do I make better decisions in the future? I did speak to another woc grad there who confirmed the racism and that she planned to leave aswell. Am I just making bad choices in life? Why can’t I find a good job to fit me. I went to therapy for years to tackle child hood issues and my eating issue. We also touched on this issue, but I thought I solved it. I’m trying to keep myself busy by doing more courses to improve my job prospects.

I even made a fool of myself. I emailed the other director to let him know I had left( he was travelling overseas), he was very fond of me and sent me a nice message. The next day I asked him if he could reconsider the job. My partner said I should ask. I also spoke to hr as she gave me her number if anything changes. The recruiter who got me the job told me to call hr as the company needs to sort their practices out. I spoke to her and explained the issue she said we could have resolved it and the business may not want someone who makes impulsive decisions like that. Which is true, I just need to work on this. The reason I didn’t mention the racism to her when leaving is because hr works for the company and I couldn’t accuse the co head of being racist as a newbie, it was clear I wasn’t wanted there by my manager or colleague( it’s a small team of 4). After quitting, my period came and it was the worst. I don’t know if this has something to do with my emotions. ",1,1741173138.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

Things are very much going strong and we are both secure in the relationship, but on the flip side the amount of pain my heart feels when we have to say goodbye is like some cruel joke from god saying ""here, have the man of your dreams but we're gonna put him 4,000 miles away from you"". He's wonderful in every way--kind, intelligent, funny, doting, and we always make a point to build eachother up as well as talk on the phone daily. This is part of the reason why I bawled my eyes out when he let go of me to walk through security at the airport and I haven't stopped since I've gotten home. Everything reminds me of his absence--the leftovers we spent hours cooking together, his blankets on the bed, the smell of his jacket, his chosen 'favorite' mug for our morning coffee. We seem to have said goodbye before, but this time feels so much more difficult and raw to my emotions. How can I pull myself together when I'm constantly being reminded of his absence in my empty flat? I miss him so much...

""Before we signed the lease of our Colaba Causeway store, we had apprehensions about the street stalls blocking our visibility from the main road. But Colaba is Colaba - every store has a stall in front and it is the stalls that have more legacy than the stores, so we decided to give it a try. Last 12 months we started seeing this store sales explode and also tracking some 1 lakh+ bills here, so I went to find out what’s going on! 

Turns out the fastest growing cohort of customers is Arab women who come to Mumbai for medical tourism. They love Indian makeup because they also have warm undertones like us and they need products that suit hot weather, but how do they discover us?

Well, Suraj and his father have been running the fruit stall in front of us for years and lots of Arab women stop by to buy local fruits (they don’t prefer anything imported). He asks them in Arabic, which he has picked up well, if they want “Kahaal Al Hindi” which means Indian kajals. They come in to try Indian makeup and eventually shop 15-20 pieces each of all the colours they like as they don’t expect to return. 

When there are no customers, Megha invites father and son for tea in the AC and that’s when he teaches her some Arabic too, especially all the names of makeup products and colours! So, when Megha has foreign customers, she in her broken Arabic, is also able to remind them to shop some authentic Indian fruits before they head out. 

India is truly a land of entrepreneurs. And while we must have processes and systems, in my limited retail experience, it is the people that make the biggest difference - and sometimes people who don’t even belong to the system ♥️""",1,1741172425.0,Indianbusinessbabu,0,1.0,False

We get a grocery delivery twice a week, and every lunchtime, the office manager pops some marinated and breaded chicken in the oven for everyone. When she is absent I happily do this!
We also have a very expensive coffee machine controlled by an iPad that creates lattes, cappuccinos etc.

About a month after I first started, I and two other junior ladies were asked if we’d be willing to learn how to clean the coffee machine in the event that the office manager was away. I don’t drink coffee at all, but I said I didn’t mind cleaning the machine occasionally. Those two ladies have since left.

The first incident was a few months ago. I work in finance and am insanely busy on the first working day of the month, which happened to be the day she was off and wanted me to clean the machine. I stayed an hour past closing time and had to leave because I’m reliant on public transport. Monday morning she was incredibly rude about me not doing it, and when I said I was busy, she scoffed at me and said “oh come on, it only takes 10 minutes.” she cleaned the machine then and there and made a giant scene for anyone that wanted coffee, saying things like “sorry guys! I’m cleaning it right now, it didn’t get done Friday because I was off,” and being really passive aggressive. I had a word with HR, who said they would arrange a rota for other people to clean the machine, which hasn’t happened.

We now have the auditors in, so I was incredibly busy and Monday was also the 1st working day of the month. The office manager was off Wednesday through to Monday, and even though I was busy, I set reminders and made sure to clean machine. I now work from home on Fridays, so I cleaned the machine as soon as I got in on Monday and again in the evening.
This morning, the manager called me downstairs, where all the nozzles were soaking in hot water. She said that I must have not cleaned the machine properly because the nozzles were caked in old milk. I told her the truth - I cleaned it twice, and even made small talk with the owner of the company while I was cleaning the nozzles on Monday morning. People witnessed me cleaning it. She then opened her phone and said “well I took pictures - this about of milk doesn’t build up in a day.”
She then said she would book another training session on how to clean the machine properly, and said that one of the new girls could also learn. In the moment I kindof panicked and just nodded at her. 

WIBTA if I went to HR again and said I’m no longer willing to clean the machine? I’ve just won employee of the month because I’m always willing to help and it feels a bit tacky to back out, but I’m autistic and not great with conflict and she’s really upset me.

I did not expect this to work so well if at all, everything I had read about it was conflicting or negative. I feel like one of the lucky ones because I had no negative side effects and actually more positive effects than anything.

Unexpected side effects: my IBS (lifelong) hasn't flared up AT ALL. I assume because food is actually staying in my digestive system long enough instead of rushing right through me. Which is why I think I always felt hungry no matter what before. 

0 desire for alcohol. I went from drinking every single day to having maybe 6 glasses of wine total in the last 4 months. 


I wish I had known before: 
I should have stuck with a lower dose for longer, 3mg was working just fine for me and I could have kept going with that instead of switching to 7mg after 1 month. I literally had to force myself to eat because I wasn't hungry at all and I was really worried about malnutrition and possibly an ED. 



Protein & hydration is key!! I put vanilla protein powder in my coffee and stocked up on 'kind' protein bars and low calorie protein bars.

The idea that more cushioning and support is ""better"" for you is the opposite of the truth. This made me start questioning other things promoted as ""healthy"" or ""necessary"" but actually do more harm than good. For example:

* Mattresses – We're told we need thick, plush beds for good sleep, but in reality, we're built to sleep on firmer surfaces. Mattresses encourage people to sleep in positions that aren't ideal for the body in the long term and our bodies stiffen up to counterbalance the cushoning.
* Soap & other cleaning products – Shampoos and body washes strip the skin of natural oils and disrupt the skin microbiome.
* Coffee & caffeine – It's a stimulant with long-term downsides that has somehow been labelled healthy.

To be clear, I don't buy into grounding or pseudoscience, although I acknowledge many would call my takes pseudoscience.

1j40fgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1j40fgo/theres_something_in_the_alley/,There’s Something in the Alley,"I have lived in the same flat for the best part of a year now. I had never really liked the place; rough area, loud neighbors and the landlord could never get anything done. The one thing I did like though was the balcony, overlooking an alleyway, attached to my apartment. This was the perfect place to get some “fresh” air or take a smoke break. I usually chose the latter. It was around 9 PM I decided to have a smoke. I grabbed my pack of Marlborough Golds from my bedside table, put my work laptop on charge, and ventured outside onto my balcony. It was winter so it was completely pitch black, aside from the light from streetlamps seeping through both entrances to the alley. My flat was positioned directly in the middle of the alley, meaning I was equal distance from both entrances. Paired with the fact I was about 15 feet in the air, it was almost complete isolation in my eyes. Perfect.


9:13 PM

When I had the time, I smoked slowly, thoroughly enjoying the process of rolling, lighting and smoking. I had the time tonight, so that I did. I was standing there for almost 15 minutes when I noticed something in the abyss below me. I should say that this alley was almost barren, nothing but a few bins and piles of rubbish to occupy it. Thats why I was startled when I noticed a pair of eyes staring up at me. I jumped. Surely there couldn’t be anyone loitering there at this time? And then, as quickly as I had seen them, they vanished almost instantly. Now, given all the evidence I had at the time, I assumed that this was just my mind playing tricks on me, probably my lack of sleep caused by my stressful job. Still, I put out my cigarette and made my way back inside, my spine tingling like that feeling you get going upstairs in the dark, like something was right behind me. I shook it off and ventured to my fridge for a beer to calm my nerves. 


10:18 PM

I had been sitting there, the remnants of four cans on my “coffee” table. My favorite show was on, but I was hardly paying attention. I was thinking about those eyes, unable to shake the feeling of being watched. Although I struggle with eye contact, I know what human eyes look like. These weren’t that. They were...longer? They aggressively rattled as they looked at me, and fast too, like an engine revving. I kept telling myself I was seeing things, and finally convinced myself to go look outside and ease my mind, knowing I’d find nothing. Hoping I’d find nothing.


10:21 PM

The night was cold. The type of cold that hurts, like ice acupuncture, sticking into my body. Tentatively, I peered over the edge of the balcony, heart pounding. I noticed I was sweating somehow, my anxiety overriding the cold preceptors in my body. There was nothing there. I rejoiced internally and started to go inside. I opened the balcony door and latched it before turning around. There, peering out of the crack of my open bedroom door was a head, eyes shaking, body unmoving. 


We stood there for a small while, taking each other in. It’s hands then clasped the door frame, unimaginably long fingers stroking the grooved wood. It was completely black, void of any light whatsoever. Its skin seemed smooth, a texture I cannot describe and thought not to be possible. It had no mouth. The main thing was its eyes, the whites contrasting with its skin, the pupils somehow darker and deeper than the rest of it. I decided I had to make a move. 


I hastily reached for the latch of the balcony door, unlocking it before grabbing the handle; opening it and sliding through as fast as I could. All the while I kept my eyes on it, shaking like a wet dog. I locked the door from the outside and stood there, panting. I looked down at the floor, hand on knees, whilst regaining my breath. Huge mistake. I looked up to see its face, pressed up against the panel window on the door, its eyes as wide as ever, looking into my very being. 


I have called the police and decided to write this now in case something happens to me. I am still looking directly at it for fear it may move, typing this from the corner of my eye. 


If anything happens to me, this is my story. 


There was something in the alley. Now it's in my home.

The idea that more cushioning and support is ""better"" for you is the opposite of the truth. This made me start questioning other things promoted as ""healthy"" or ""necessary"" but actually do more harm than good. For example: 

* Mattresses – We're told we need thick, plush beds for good sleep, but in reality, we're built to sleep on firmer surfaces. Mattresses encourage people to sleep in positions that aren't ideal for the body in the long term and our bodies stiffen up to counterbalance the cushoning.

* Coffee & caffeine – It's a stimulant with long-term downsides that has somehow been labelled healthy.

Our [OP](https://old.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1j2zhem/german_breakfast_for_project_howd_i_do/?ref=share&ref_source=link) tried to make a typical German breakfast for a school assignment. However, the source they found for typical breakfast foods in Germany has led them astray, and the resulting breakfast looks quite odd to the users of r/germany. While many offer constructive criticism, some users have harsher words for the OP:

---

>No offence but that's what I'd expect an AI to draw if I asked it for a picture of german breakfast

>Edit: [I did](https://imgur.com/a/uuJZz7v)

>>Even the AI one is better lol

>>>Except for that jar of gold. We don't usually have this amount of money lying around. We have a Bausparvertrag.

>>-

>>>Fucking grapes? What are we fr*nch now??

>>-

>>>Nah Bro, OP completely killed it and brought the lifelessness of German cuisine the socialism and simplicity of the German idiosyncracy reflected on the beige (yellow) color everywhere. Even the bitterness of the Germans is perfectly described in the burned edges of the sausages, which would cause an average German to describe this breakfast as ruiniert.

>>>Edit: Scramble eggs are too complicated it should have been a 6 minute hard boiled egg no salt.

>>>>You okay?

>>[OP] Dang, I cooked it tho

>>>How did you cook, did you do research? How could there be no mentioning of cold cuts, cheeses, meat, optional muesli...

>>>Don't tell me you just asked ChatGPT

>>-

>>>bro it looks nice i dont know why everyone is beeing a dick

>>>>that is very german of us tbh - they asked how they did and the germans come in and are brutally honest about it. xD

---

>How can someone in this day and age with access to literally ever possible piece of information available fail so hard is commendable

>>I suspect that part of the problem is that if you search the Internet in English for information about German breakfasts, you're going to find a lot of Americans and other English-speakers describing what they believe German breakfasts are like. Witness the very next submission in this subreddit, in which OP's ""heritage"" apparently involves eating Kaiserschmarrn for breakfast.

>>>Wait, do you mean you don't have Käsespätzle with Jägerschnitzel for breakfast on weekdays?

>>-

>>>This is what young people typically do, they do not Google. It is too much effort (they will readily tell you so). If they look for info, they use chatgpt.

>>-

>>>Imagine someone put effort into this and presents it to people and gets those snarky, non helpful comments.

>>>>They asked. We're answering. If you don't want answers, don't ask.

>>>>>Thank you for repeating the point for a third time even after I have laid out my reasoning, which you generously ignored. I’m impressed how people can just write comments without contributing to a conversation.

>>>-

>>>>Well, they did ask for feedback. And it is just not a typical German breakfast, it is just a weird assemblage of items

---

>As we would say in Germany:

>""Du hast es immerhin versucht""

>>""Op war stets bemüht""

---

>2/10 This ist more like britisch breakfast with german stuff.

>Where ist ham/ cheese/ sliced sausages? I miss brezels, German buns and oatmeal.

---

>This is no Frühstück. This is rage bait.

---

>Where is my NUTELLA???1?1???

---

>Hey op thank you for our effort. We appreciate it.

>However the result is insulting. 😄

>Your sausage is burnt

>>[OP] I know, didn't know i was supposed to cook in water

---

>if you're having an boiled egg - where is the **Eierschalensollbruchstellenverursacher** ?

---

>Poor guy just wanted to do a german breakfast and gets absolutely roasted

---

>As a breakfast eater, I am offended by this. Firstly, your Kartoffel-Rührei is all wrong. You need more potatoes, and you need to fry them. Not whatever this abomination is. Secondly, why is your bread not cut, and where are the Brötchen? No sweet pastries for breakfast. NO SAUSAGES FOR BREAKFAST WTF. Fruits, Coffee and Orange juice are ok. 2/10

---

>Sometimes I hate this sub and this negativity and know-it-all attitude without any reflection

>OP tried something new and something nice.

>Sure, give him advice how to improve, but why have nearly all comments negative karma, where OP explains in absolutely normal tone why he did some things a bit different. Sometimes not even that (I don't preslice my bread, too. That's for lazy savages who like dry bread).

>@OP it's a good first try, some hits some misses. Don't let the negative comments affect you. Take some of the advice in the comments and I'm curious to see what the second attempt will look like.

>>[OP] Thank you, I need to see these comments.

---

>OMG. Please please please for the love god tell me that the sausages aren't white sausage.
Because if they are, you've committed war crimes by pan frying them. They get heated in hot water (note, not boiled!).

>>[OP] My bad... I'll check that war crime off the list

---

> WTF are these comments? They act like you were taking an exam. Also why are you getting downvoted in the comments for nothing? A shame how we Germans act sometimes. I think you did well OP and that looks like an awesome breakfast with many things that are common for a German breakfast. As others have said, the sausage is not really common for breakfast (I think that is more a UK thing) but I wouldn't say ""no"" to it either 😄

>>They are getting downvoted because they are trying to represent a culture, apparently did zero research and created something so off that it's almost hilarious. Not only did they get most of the stuff plain wrong, they couldn't be bothered to just... google it for 5 minutes. This is not ""germans"" acting weird. This a people rightfully being confused about their culture being misrepresented...

>>I could go ""hmm I'll make a japanese breakfast!"" And just stack california roll sushi on top of instant ramen. Like great, yes. Those things are japanese in a sense, I guess. But it's also just wrong...?

>>OP has the ability to use the internet. They know this sub exists. So one can assume they would be able to just either ask or literally use the infinite knowledge provide by the internet, that they are literally using, to create something semi-accurate. But no. 0 research. 0 effort. What are we supposed to do? Clap? Come on.

>>They asked for feedback. They got honest feedback.

>>What use would it be to lie and say ""Yes this great. Well done"" if it's just not the case.

>>Also just wanna point out that lost people have been kind and offered advice on how to improve it. And the question wasn't if this is edible. I'm sure lost people would eat this.

>>The question was if it's accurate, which it is not.

>>>This is ridiculous. Is this some form of contest? Also most of the thing on that table ARE accurate. What do you excpect? Put every variety of every breakfast of each part of Germany on that table? Lol! Someone put effort into doing something and your first response is to nitpick and put them down. I'm sure people like you encourage others to stay interested in our culture lol.

>>>>First of all, I answered the others commenters question, explaing why the thread is as it is. So idk why I'm being bunched up with people who take this whole thing way to serious.

>>>>If you truley think scrambled eggs with mozzarella strips and fried white sausage with whole loafs of bread and coffee from a teapot are ""accurate"" then I'd like to know where in Germany you live.

>>>>To me this isn't accurate. That's all. There is no nitpicking. OP asked if it's accurate. And my, and others, answer was no. And in my other comment I was neither mean nor making it a ""contest""... whatever that means.

>>>>People gave advice on how to improve, even. What are you talking about? OP literally asked this. ""Is this accurate"". Is abyone just supposed to be like ""yes. Bye."" M??

>>>>Why would anyone lie. How would that help OP?

>>>>Being interested in a culture and getting it wrong is fine. Vehemently arguing against people from that culture, telling you what is amiss, is not however.

>>>>It's nice that OP tried and is interested but that doesn't change the fact that most people in this thread, and in Germany, wouldn't call this a ""normal german breakfast"" by ANY means.

>>>>Or do you think my analogy of sushi on instant ramen is a accurate representation of japense cusine, let alone breafast...?

---

>No offense but you did very badly

>>[OP] None taken

>>>I was being mean. I thought that the picture is 100% AI generated, so I answered very snarky. In the case that you actually put all that together and arranged it on the table, that was completely unnecessary by me

For the convenience of new members to the Galactic Confederacy.



Foreword



There was once a small amount of text here... It's not small now. This USED to be the Galactic Confederacy's Phraseology and Terminology document, but it has been EXTENSIVELY revised, as we apparently missed... Quite a few of them. And more importantly, the dire warnings that follow them. So we're going to try again. Consider this your first of many warnings.



Welcome to the Galactic Confederacy! Before you begin your official duties or receive any assistance as needed, a short orientation period is necessary. However, in case of an emergency such as war, disaster or other such circumstances, you will receive aid immediately.



Regardless of circumstances, this document serves as a guide to the galaxy's most... eccentric member - Humans.



Humanity were the creators of the Confederacy. Initially they decided to try to form a Federation of states of sorts, but differences in Galactic politics and resource logistics meant that system was not a viable option. So they created the Confederacy instead. We all operate under our own system of governance, with agreements for free trade and security for merchant fleets from pirates. Registration systems to prevent fraudsters and as you probably know by now - a universal criminal registry to protect the galaxy against ne'er do wells.



But one thing about humans? They're very eccentric... Strange... unpredictable. Some might even say insane. Be that as it may they have become an indispensable, immutable, unimaginably needed resource, and most would say, friend within the galactic community.



Also - for the more warmongering members of the galactic community, a fair warning. Humans have this thing where they have no sense of scale, no 'chill' and the engineering prowess to make this silliness a reality. They have BIGGER ships than you, more heavily armed ships than you, more ships than you in total and they WILL splatter your face across the sixteen vectors if you give them the reason to.



So please don't.



In any case, when it comes to humans they have these phrases, words and 'human-isms' that mean certain things in certain situations. Things, which when said, mean certain things. This glossary will tell you what to do in the event of such things being said. Without further ado, here they are:

  
  


Number One - Hold My Beer



Ultimately one of the most infamous phrases in human history, this phrase is often used when a human wishes to do something crazy or 'one-up' another individual. This phrase is a human's way of stating the fact he or she CAN and WILL do better than the thing they just saw.



This is generally considered a good thing, owing to varying circumstances. In the right circumstances, this can mean two engineers engaging in an interesting sparring match in which they are trying to beat each other in a 'build-off'. This usually means the galaxy has another glorious innovation of technology, or a really big (CENSORED)-off gun to use against the Confederacy's enemies.



OR it could be used as a reason for you to drop everything and RUN.



This is NOT: An invitation for you to actually hold the human's beer. Ask the Councillor from Hamaris IV who did that once... He regretted it.

This is NOT: An order for you to take the human's beer from him. The Great Marankis The Fifth from the Saranis Sector still has nightmares about that day.

This is NOT: An invitation for you to take the human's beer, and drink it, even in jest. You cannot ask the last guy who did that, as he can no longer speak.

  
  


Number Two - Eh, what could happen?



This is a term used by engineers, mechanics and gunnery personnel, said by them shortly before they do something that:



Makes a star implode.

Makes a star explode.

Makes a planet explode.

Makes a planet implode.

Turns a gas giant into a star.

Wipes out an entire enemy star fleet.

Wipes out a friendly star fleet (usually by accident).

And many others.



This is essentially a human's way of saying ""I have no idea what this does, but let's see what it does anyway."" And this phrase is usually used just before testing an experimental device and/or weapon. Just before something explodes. Or Implodes. Or explodes THEN implodes. Or defies the laws of the universe and turns into cheese. Please don't ask us about that last one.



This phrase is effectively a human looking at an object or device and 'doing it anyway' because it 'might be cool'. When a human says this you:



A: RUN THE ABSOLUTE HELL AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN AMBULATE.

B: Die horribly.

C: Grab the human and restrain him/her as soon as possible, and stop them from activating the device.



For reference's sake, this phrase also shares similar connotations with 'What could possibly go wrong?"" The answer to that question is 'everything'. Respond to it in a similar fashion as directed above.

  
  


Number Three - Don't Worry About It



This is one of the most terrifying phrases a human can say. This usually happens when something BAD is about to happen, is happening or has happened. This phrase is uttered during, before or after a disastrous event. This phrase was originally used by humans to lie to alien crew members in an attempt to calm or placate them in case of emergency. Then that human did something suicidally insane to stop the problem from being problematic. Usually to their detriment. And/or death.



When a human says to you 'don't worry about it' the first and ONLY thing you should do is:



Worry about it.



When you are finished worrying about it, say your last goodbyes to that human, you are likely not going to see them again. At least not alive anyway. The only good thing about this phrase and its subsequent utterance is that the problem it is in reference to, almost always (within a 98% margin) gets resolved, fixed or finished. The bad news is, if a human fixes it, that human usually has to have a statue of them built with posthumous award ceremonies.



For the sake of reference, the Galactic Economic Crash of '86 was due to us running out of metals to make all the medals.

  
  


Number Four - That's Just My Pet



Humans are a strange species with the uncanny ability to make friends with absolutely anything and everything. From plants, to predators, to herbivores, to deathworms, to entire sapient planets. Humans will actively attempt to make friends with EVERYTHING, even the wastebasket in the office.



This effectively means that humans have a habit of making pets, 'friends' or companions out of some of the most dangerous, vicious, evil, hateful, vile or predatory species in the galaxy. Examples of this are:



Lorelei The Farmer and her pet Bakandi Deathworm Jeff.

Simon and his pet Jackie The Giant Gemstone Golem.

Paul and his pet Dire Jackal 'Wolfie'.

Oliver and his 'best bud' - a Giant Mountain Sized Crustacean.

Jessica and her pet Super Chicken Loki.

Timothy and his best friend, Orlos The World Man - A Sapient planet.



Generally speaking, this unimaginably incredible ability to make friends with anything is just as much a curse as it is a blessing. On one hand, these humans can casually wander around with domesticated variants of the single most dangerous beasts in the known universe. On the other hand They can make friends with anything, which means in a dangerous situation, the best place to be is near the human.

  
  


Number Five - Would



This is undoubtedly THE most dangerous thing a human can say, especially when they're looking at you. But not for the reason you think. But nowhere near as dangerous as the word 'WILL'. But also not for the reason you think. The reason for this is entirely due to humans and their erm... breeding habits.



Yes, exactly the opposite reason you think. Human reproduction is one of the most complicated systems ever discovered by sapient life. They have no 'off' switch, and WILL actively attempt, if possible, to bonk anything that tickles their fancy. Unlike most denizens of the galaxy, humans will engage in sexual activity for entertainment, and they have no seasonal fertility cycle.



The good news is, that humans themselves are quite.... delightful. They are perhaps the most appealing species to look at and be around. Natural body warmth, mammalian in nature, omnivorous, with symmetrical features. Sounds nice doesn't it?



There are three ways to handle the situation of a human looking at you and saying 'Would'.



Option A - Reciprocate, and use the phrase 'I would too'. This depends on if you like the human in question.

Option B - As fast as you can ambulate, do so rapidly in any direction the human isn't. In short - run the hell away.

Option C - Politely decline and walk away. This is generally the best option.



Please be aware, humans consider 'forcible' or 'unwanted' sexual contact as one of the most vile and egregious criminal offences one can imagine, at least to humans. Humans WILL commit themselves to your destruction in every way possible if you do this. With gusto.



So please don't.



Seriously.

  
  


Number Six - Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time...



This phrase is usually uttered during the aftermath of an experiment gone wrong, a failure of engineering, or when a human builds an enormous weapon and it fails spectacularly. Or performs so well it accidentally kills a god.



And that last part did in fact happen. They did in fact, accidentally kill a god. They promised they wouldn't kill a god again. We do not yet know if this promise has been kept.

  
  


Number Seven - Hmm... That's interesting.



This phrase is used by a human who has - unsurprisingly - discovered something interesting, unusual or fascinating. This happens after the discovery of a new species, a new planet, and odd shaped asteroid or other such occurrence.



Unfortunately it means that this human is going to be fascinated by whatever it is they just found for several hours to several days in duration. The human will be fixated on the task of 'being fascinated' with this object or entity to such an extent their usual duties will be forgotten or abandoned or simply not done, in favour of this objective.



Fortunately this fascination, especially with certain humans such as scientists or mechanics, who will end up (usually) providing some kind of benefit that makes up for their lack of work. This can mean massively upgraded reactor capacity, a new scientific discovery, an upgrade for gunnery targeting strength. Among many, many other things. Generally speaking, you must:



1 - Modify your duty roster, the job still needs to be done.

2 - Secure the human's work area to make sure they don't accidentally cook with explosives.

3 - Make sure the human has the necessary tools or implements to complete the task - they WILL use anything they can get their hands on. Including stuff usually not meant for use as tools.

  
  


Number Eight - This'll Just Take A Sec



A phrase that essentially means a task will take either a few minutes to a few days to complete. Again one of those things that humans do to placate the people around them and calm everyone's fears down. The duration of this task can be, as stated, a few seconds, or up to a few days, depending on everything. The human will often repeat this phrase during the task if you ever ask him how it's going. And regardless of duration will usually follow up by stating 'See? I told you it would only take a sec!' even if the task took several weeks.

  
  


Number Nine - Because Reasons or 'I was bored'



This is a phrase used by a human, usually after they complete a particularly dangerous, silly or stupid task. Such as:



Using a detached door from a crashed landing pod to 'snowboard' down a mountain.

Using explosives 'for fun'. 

Pressing random buttons on a gunnery console.

Using munitions as dominoes in private quarters.

Creating a huge obstacle course using toothpicks.

Using matches to make a volcano.

Modifying the coffee machine to accept twenty seven cups at once.



The ONLY way to prevent these situations is to prevent boredom in humans. Give him an electronic device with games, reading material, video recordings or access to GalNet and GalaxyTube, in order to keep them occupied. A bored engineer IS THE MOST DANGEROUS HUMAN YOU WILL EVER MEET.

  
  


Number Ten - This Is Going To Hurt



A phrase used before a serious incident, when the human’s capacity for momentary foresight and pattern recognition suddenly understands there's about to be a problem. Or, when a human is about to do something stupid, like jump off a roof, chase a tornado, get in front of an avalanche, or do something dangerous. It depends on the situation of course, but it can either mean the human who spoke it just warned you to take cover or retreat to safety, or as a cue for you to retrieve a First Aid Kit.



Upon hearing this phrase, first consider the context, then do the following:



Option A - If it's a stunt, a dangerous trick or some other leisure activity, shrug your shoulders (or analogue thereof) and retrieve a First Aid Kit. The human will need it.

Option B - If it's a dangerous situation like an industrial accident or some kind of explosive danger - RUN.

Option C - If the human is annoyed with you for some reason the hurt will be yours. Try to placate them or run away very fast. If this doesn't work, know that it will hurt but you will at least survive... Probably.

  
  


Number Eleven - FOR SCIENCE!!!



This phrase is used by a human engaging in experimentation, especially humans that are somewhat eccentric or abnormal in mentality. They will start an experiment or test and go ""FOR SCIENCE!!"" before diving into whatever it is they are doing. This phrase is usually followed by one of the following statements:



""Oops..."" - If the experiment went wrong and something exploded.

""Well... That happened."" - If the experiment had unexpected positive, or negative results.

""Oh shit..."" - If the experiment went badly wrong.

""OH FUCK!!"" - If the experiment went horribly wrong.

""There's a void-ish feeling where my spleen was... That's bad right?"" - You don't want to know.

""Can anybody else taste purple?"" - You REALLY don't want to know.



So basically this phrase is generally deployed when a human is about to try to do something 'just to see what happens' and it usually ends badly for them. The humans justify this behaviour by saying 'well now we know what not to do.' In the belief we already didn't know what mixing (CENSORED) with (CENSORED) and (CENSORED) does.

  
  
  


Number Twelve - All That Is Certain In Life Is Death And Taxes



You don't really need to react when a human says this. We're just putting this here because... well it's true, isn't it?

  
  
  


Number Thirteen - Silence



Silence is... Scary when it comes to humans. It means one of three things:



A - They are dead and you need to contact authorities immediately.

B - They are asleep and you must not disturb them at all unless you present the ritual sacrifice of a cup of coffee.

C - They are concentrating on a specific task. Some humans will actively talk to themselves while working to help them concentrate. Do not disturb them unless they are fiddling with nuclear material.



There are however exceptions to this rule - this especially applies to human children. Silence usually means the child is up to something that isn't good and needs to be found and stopped immediately. A quiet human child either means they are taking a nap, or they are engaging in activity which will likely mean all of the sugar will be spread all over the kitchen floor. Or the toilets will be blocked. Or windows will be broken. Or explosives will turn up missing.



Etcetera.

  
  
  


Number Fourteen - Hear Me Out...



This phrase is often used by humans for the purposes of laying out their opinion on certain activities and political or religious standpoints.



The sane ones do that anyway.



The phrase 'Hear Me Out' when spoken by anyone other than the sane ones, usually Precedes a human doing one of the following activities:



Using a cannon in an attempt to deep fry poultry.

Using large quantities of gasoline in an attempt to light a campfire.

Using a railgun launch mechanism to deliver mail.

Using a starship's main Gauss Laser to carve out a smiley face on the surface of a moon.

Using explosives to heat up army ration packs.

Or other things of that nature.



So... Be careful and consider present company when hearing this phrase. It could either be a reason for you to demand a cup of coffee as payment for a debate, or a reason for you to pray to the Gods.

  
  
  


Number Fifteen - Oops...



This can mean several different things depending on tone of voice:



Gleeful: The human is likely watching something akin to a funny clip show on the extranet, relating to someone failing to perform a stunt or getting 'decked' after acting stupid.

Quiet: Something very bad just happened and you are all about to die in a spectacular fashion that will end up in GalNews with annual specials, and documentaries until the heat death of the universe.

Hyperventilating: Something EVEN WORSE just happened but the human is actively using up oxygen to work as fast as possible to fix the issue.



Oops is the universal phrase that means something has gone wrong, or is about to go wrong.

  
  
  


Number Sixteen - Don't Push The Red Button



Human ships have this strange tradition of having a rather large, very obvious big red button somewhere on the ship. We have never understood why, or how, or even when this tradition started. But every single ship has somewhere in it, a big, fat, glowing red button.



DO NOT PRESS THIS BUTTON UNLESS EXPLICITLY DIRECTED TO DO SO BY A HUMAN.



This button has been pressed accidentally or out of curiosity before. Bad things happened. Such as:



Enabling the Nuclear warheads present on EVERY human ship.

Activating an automated security protocol that exterminates all non-registered crew members.

Activating the Self destruct sequence.

Activating the 'blow up a random star' cannon.

Enabling the shield system that prevents anyone from leaving the ship. Ever.

Enabling the time drive system that jumps the ship to the 1970s... for some reason.



Again, this button does a whole massive host of things. It varies ship to ship, crew to crew, sometimes even engineer to engineer. There can be multiple buttons on a ship, or just one very BIG button. We have no idea how or why these functions would even exist, let alone be installed inside a star ship, but they are, and that big red button controls those mechanisms.



Please don't ask why. Not even they know.

  
  
  


Number Seventeen - YET.



This is a word you need to be afraid of. This is a word that is usually the word that follows some kind of impossible task or strange occurrence. You say, for example: ""Time travel is not possible."" The human will respond with ""YET"" and before you know it, you will be trapped in Earth Ancient Era's being hunted by a giant murder lizard. Or ascended to the next plane of existence involuntarily. Or you become a god. Or become a demon. Or get teleported to a place called MuffinLand.



Or have your entire planet turned into a giant cheese fondue. Yes this happened.



When a human says ""YET."" Run the feck away and pretend not to exist.

  
  
  


Number Eighteen - I Wonder If It Tastes Like Chicken



This phrase is usually uttered when a human encounters unusual alien food, or some kind of foodstuff or edible while exploring a planet. This is normal. Human brains function abnormally compared to the rest of the galaxy, and often will understand something by experiencing it first. This usually ends badly, but not the way you think.



After numerous medical advances, humans can survive almost anything they ingest save lethal chemicals like cyanide or expended nuclear fuel. Of course they are intelligent enough to know NOT to do that. But it wont stop them from grabbing and munching on a random mushroom or berry off a bush. Humans usually carry a syringe around with them that allows them to get away with this.



I Wonder If It Tastes Like Chicken is basically a human's way of saying 'can I eat this' and then attempting to compare the flavour (if any) to a certain poultry that exists on their home world, Earth.



If a human says this, be prepared for copious quantities of vomiting, diarrhoea or gastrointestinal stress responses, shortly before the human jabs themselves with the aforementioned syringe.



We still don't know why... But when a human likes what they are eating, its a sign you've either stumbled on a new favourite food stuff, or something that will make the human happy, but will make you explode.



If a human ever offers you this if you are there to witness it upon them liking it, politely decline and state you are on a diet. This will get them to back off.



Humans are omnivorous, in a sense more completely than most other galactic species. They got that way by eating everything they could, and the ones that didn't die were the ones that would go on to breed. Also, the ones nearby the humans that did die would say, ""Huh, I guess that's not edible yet. Maybe we should try \[pickling, salting, boiling, drying, fermenting, baking, freezing, aging, cooking, immersing in acid, immersing in base, fractional distillation, etc\]""



It is rumoured that there still exist a few species on Earth that humans cannot yet eat. They are generally brightly colored, and humans use them as recreational drugs.

  
  
  


Number Nineteen - It could've been worse



This phrase works in a similar manner to other phrases, but this one usually arrives after any major catastrophe, disaster and/or explosive diarrhoea incident. The human who said it will usually be to blame for said incident such as:



Experiment gone wrong. (See section labelled FOR SCIENCE!!)

Button was pressed that shouldn't have been pressed (See section labelled DON'T PRESS THE BIG RED BUTTON)

A star being accidentally turned into a pulsar.

Crash landing on an alien planet.

Time travelling to the 1970s (Again we really don't know why it's the 70s.)

Bad taco bell. (See Galactic Historical Archive Year 883 CBA for The Great Toilet Strike Of '83 for information)



The human will always respond with 'could've been worse' as if to try to placate his audience. This human must be PUNCHED or disciplined in whatever way you see fit.

  
  
  


Number Twenty - LEROOOOYY JENKINS!!!



This phrase comes from the ancient days of human 'internet' and video game culture. This phrase is usually said just before a human is about to perform and incredible heroic sacrifice, a glorious derring do, a magnificent stunt or is about to walk into a Balthagrok nest armed only with his boxers.



And shockingly that guy not only survived but ended up with a trade deal. No we aren't kidding.

  
  
  


Number Twenty One - Nope.



Nope is the universal word meaning 'I don't like what I just saw'. It is a human way of responding to dangerous objects, dangerous wildlife or arachnids... for some reason. When a human says 'nope' and walks away, you need to follow them. Although humans are more physically resilient than most galactic species, if they are not willing to engage in a fight - you shouldn't be either.



If the human says 'Nope, Nope, Nope' in rapid succession, this would be a good time to pray to your gods and thank them for the short life you were given. It probably won't be any longer, as this human has found something they REALLY don't like.



Conversely there is another phrase that runs along similar lines to Nope, and that is the phrase ""AW HELL NAW"". This one means the human has found something they really hate, and are running from it not to escape but to retrieve the biggest gun/stick/artillery they can find to vaporize it.



IT IS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY TO SECURE THIS HUMAN AND MAKE THEM STOP ATTEMPTING TO RETRIEVE A BIGGER GUN. They will likely either find or make this weapon and use it to blow a hole in your ship purely out of spite for the thing they want gone.

  
  
  


Number Twenty Two - F.A.F.O.



This is an acronym which, to put it politely means, 'Feck around and find out', is a clear warning that the human in question is not impressed with your threat display and is likely to respond with equal violence should you continue in whatever you were doing. Remember, the humans don't take kindly to idle threats, even a simple mating display a human accidentally sees, will be construed as a potential threat. They will respond accordingly.



When used in a political context in response to aggression, it should be taken as a most dire warning that you have stumbled upon a topic that humans are not willing to back down on and will respond with an unreasonable amount of retaliation. It also implies that they are already prepared for conflict, assets have already been moved into position, and are ready to respond immediately as well as overwhelmingly. It means you have just stumbled into a trap, and you need to suddenly become very small and escape into the ventilation system.



Take the opportunity given to backtrack to a less aggressive stance. Or be the next example (23 such examples thus far) as to why one does not 'try one's luck' with the humans. Especially the engineers.

  
  
  


Number Twenty Three - Fren Shaped



This phrase is spoken when a human comes across a lifeform that is universally dangerous, but the human thinks is 'cute', endearing or 'adorable'. The human will enquire about the beast in question and utter something along the lines of 'if why not fren, why fren shape?'



This is the human being disappointed he or she cannot make friends with the beast. As previously stated about their propensity for domestication, this wont stop them from trying.



You however CAN stop them from trying by simply using the 'no pets allowed' rule on your ship or station. Even if everyone else has pets, the human will call hypocrisy and eventually will give up and go for a pet or companion that fits with the rest of the crew. Or another tactic is that if all pets on board ship or station are of the same breed, you can say '(insert pet here) gang' or 'only REAL shipmates have this one'.



This is indeed a cruel practise, but one that will ultimately prevent the human from befriending a Bakandi Deathworm and bringing it on board.



Yes this has in fact happened.

  
  
  


Number Twenty Four - Well... Fuck.



This phrase comes in multiple variations. ""Fuck this. Fuck it. Fuck you. Fuck me. Fuck. FUCK!!!!! And, the absolute worst, a very quiet and calm, ""Well, fuck.""



There is also a different variation that means roughly the same thing, only slightly less. ""Shit. Bullshit. SHIT!!!!! And still terrifyingly quiet and calm, ""Well, shit...""



They all mean roughly the same thing. Something very VERY bad is about to happen, or has happened but the consequences of that action have yet to be fully realized. When a human says these things, run. Or waddle. Or ambulate. Or squirm. Or goop. Anything. Just. GO. Whatever you were doing before, it no longer matters. Just. GO.



If a human says any of these phrases while looking at the coffee machine though... Then the situation has just turned nuclear and you now have a frustrated, angry, caffeine deprived human in your vicinity.



DON'T offer them tea in its place. They WILL do worse than kill you. Especially Texans... Although many humans would prefer you NOT self terminate, the procedure is as follows:



1: politely ask the human what is wrong.

2: if they say the coffee machine isn't working, you will IMMEDIATELY summon ALL available mechanics, technicians and engineers to repair the device.

3: Distract the human with a random conversation or order to accomplish a task that requires concentration. Such as gunnery calibration. They find it funny for some reason.

4: Repair the coffee machine with all haste. If the coffee machine cannot be repaired, two options are available:



A: Mass suicide.

B: Politely tell the human you will buy a new one at the next port, and he will have to 'make do' with tea. Generally the better option.



THIS phrase is why most alien ships have four or five boxes of unpacked coffee machines in the cargo bay if they have a human as a crewmate.

  
  
  


And that will be all for orientation! There is a lot more obviously, but outlying the some odd two thousand phrases used by humans, would result in this orientation pamphlet being the size of a large seven hundred page novel.  We will let you get used to how things work on your own time.



We had to. Now you do too.



Welcome to the Galactic Confederacy, and please Gods make it stop...

1j405x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FattyLiverNAFLD/comments/1j405x4/fatty_liver_and_enlarged_spleen/,Fatty Liver and Enlarged Spleen,"I booked a private MRI test of the abdomen and pelvis due to having abdominal symptoms throughout January (suspected IBS flare-up currently controlled by low FODMAP diet.)

During the scan they found ""mild infiltration of fat in the liver"" and a mildly enlarged spleen at 13cm. This was in February 2025.

I have lost around 30lbs since July 2024 but I still have a long way to go before I reach a healthy BMI.

My GP is testing my bloods for liver function again (they were last tested in May 2024 and all came back as normal) and will book in for an ultrasound of the spleen in 3 months' time. 

I am already avoiding sugar and limiting processed foods due to being on the low FODMAP diet (I will start reintroducing FODMAPs next week) but if my IBS remains stable I intend to follow the Mediterranean diet principles.

I'm also waiting to hear back on a SIBO test and am due to take a GI mapping test soon so I may need to resolve some issues with my gut using the same kind of lifestyle that will hopefully reverse the NAFLD. 

My Functional Nutrition Practitioner has asked me to take L-Glutamine although since I got my MRI results she's asked me to hold off on taking any new supplements. I haven't yet taken any L-Glutamine but have read that this can seriously affect liver function in some people?

I want to also start reintroducing coffee into my diet (I stopped having it during the IBS flare-up as I have IBS-D) as I've heard that helps. 

I am trying to get an average of 7000 steps a day and want to incorporate some strength training (I have some equipment at home) when I get time. 

The MRI also picked up a small paraumbilical hernia of fat so I have to be careful in terms of putting more strain on that.

Is there anything else I could be doing? I don't really drink alcohol, maybe once or twice a year but I've not had any this year so far.

Edit: I forgot to add - I recently had a full blood count done and there were no issues except for elevated eosinophils. Due to that and no other symptoms my GP thinks the enlarged spleen is unlikely to be caused by anything serious. If it has increased in size during the next scan then he'll want to investigate further.",2,1741170751.0,FattyLiverNAFLD,0,1.0,False

I thought I had an aberrant response to the jab.

A poster (Additional Value 64) posted that perhaps it was because I ate less on Days 1 -4 and therefore I was just hungry when I lost a bit of suppression.  I then ate more and that kept me going for Days 6 and 7.

I think that's it.  Yesterday was Day 4 and I had full suppression.  I ate very little (I was very busy).  I had two milky coffees and then at 1pm I had a bell pepper, an apple, a babybel and a banana.  I then had a very small (1/3) bowl of soup and a portion of calorie free jelly with berries in it. (note to readers, not every day is nutritionally balanced, I'm eating out the fridge and freezer and was busy).

About 7.30 I felt hungry and made some air fried chips and an egg (I have hens).

I thought about whether that was a lack of suppression, but I think it's just I'd eaten very little.

That's really useful to know because lack of suppression decides when I move up the doses (currently on 6.75mg)

Thank you :)

Again, I know it wasn't a well balanced day, and I know I didn't eat a lot.  Do not take it as representative of my eating habits.  I just thought it was useful to post in case others are confused about when they are losing suppression and when they are just hungry because they haven't eaten enough.  I know I struggle with this.
