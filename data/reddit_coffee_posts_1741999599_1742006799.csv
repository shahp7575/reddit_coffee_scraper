Lately we've noticed a ridiculous amount of bots in the sub. They're usually brand new accounts posting a coffee mug, stickers, shirts, etc. They'll then go on to link a store of some kind of another.

We promise you we've noticed, and we're acting on them whenever we can. Help us out if you can by reporting them as spam, that'll make it easier for us to catch any we miss.

We're looking at instituting measures to limit a bots ability to spam here such as a karma requirement or minimum Reddit account age.

In the meantime, like we said, we'd appreciate help in reporting spam so we can keep our beloved sub full of the usual quality posts you all share.

Thanks Soldiers!",1,1742006579.0,karlach,0,1.0,False

I’ve been in situation-ship after situation-ship and am very over it. I met someone a few months back (27F) it was going great. We were taking things slow and suddenly she introduces me to her parents, writes me a heartfelt valentines card, things felt like the took a step forward. I was excited. Less than a week later she felt she was not in love with me and didn’t want to keep it going. She reached out the next morning asking to get coffee but I wanted some space to get control of my feelings. She understood and we will meet up in a couple weeks. It’s been about a month of no contact. 

I don’t think I need closure on anything but obviously have been optimistic she would reach out and try to fix things but I don’t know. 
I didn’t have much to say when she ended things I just made it known it’s okay and I see her. But I also felt like I ran away from feeling more pain. I’m just rambling at this point but it’s always nice to hear from others when I feel alone like I currently do. Thanks!",1,1742006480.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

 Almost every time I sit down with my coffee or food, someone, or a whole group comes and plops down at my table like I’m not even there. 

It doesn’t matter if the place is busy or not.
The worst was this one time when I was sitting alone at a table, and four guys showed up. Two sat next to me, two across from me, boxing me in. They started yelling, laughing very loud, and just acting like I didn’t exist. I was basically trapped there, trying to finish my coffee in peace. It’s happened other times too sometimes it’s a family, sometimes just one person, but they never ask if they can sit or even acknowledge me.

My infection was mild but a week later, I felt nerve pain all over my body, heavyness in my limbs, trigeminal neuralgia, vision issues, insomnia, increased anxiety and depression, GI issues, difficulty swallowing, scalp tenderness and tingling, heart rate issues, muscle twitching, ringing in ears, etc. I went to the dr after 2 weeks of symptoms and they told me it wasn't a huge deal and to wait it out. My arms were so heavy and my neck hurt so bad that it was difficult to drive to the appointment. At that time, my blood work showed that my blood sugar and A1c raised to the prediabetic range. I have PCOS, but have always had controlled blood sugar, despite being 190 pounds at the time. After 2 months, my left eye started burning. I went back to the dr, about to have a mental breakdown, because of this plus my insomnia was getting worse. They determined that my left pupil didn't react in sync with my right in dim light and ordered an MRI. The MRI showed nothing, but I was terrified. My mental health was at an all time low. I bought thousands of dollars worth of supplements. I spent all of my time looking up ways to help me. In September, I finally scheduled an appt with a psych who prescribed me Prozac. It took time to work but helped my mood stability immensely. The month after that, I was able to get in with a cardiologist and requested Ivabradine. This took time but also helped me. I wanted to address my insulin resistance as I knew that was causing inflammation. I started Mounjaro- it was rough at first- but I do think this helped keep my energy stable throughout the day because my blood sugar was stable. I wore a CGM to track what my blood sugar was doing and started wearing abdominal compression when walking and eating (game changer- shout out to Long Covid Dietitian). I also started increasing my fiber, protein, and calories in general. I addressed gut health by eating a wide range of food and taking beef kidney supplements & digestive enzymes prior to meals. I think the following supplements also helped: vitamin c, fish oil, and inflammatone. I also started taking LDN which I feel helped with my insomnia and heart rate. Now, I work out, walk a ton (I walked 15 miles the other day), drink coffee in moderation, and sleep through the night most nights. I also went through another infection and was not set back. I took paxlovid, vitamin C, oregano oil, did nasal rinses and oral rinses, and rested. I wanted to thank this group for your advice and positivity during the worst period of my life.

Lately, whenever I go to a friend’s house, I end up bringing my kettle and entire pour-over setup with me. It wasn’t always like this, but at some point, I became the coffee guy. Now it’s almost expected — they love it and look forward to it.

But today, as I was pouring, I caught myself thinking: When did this happen? When did I become the person who travels with a gooseneck kettle like it’s a plus-one?

I’m curious — for those of you who are into coffee (or any hobby, really), has it ever become a social thing for you too? Like, do your friends now rely on you to bring the “good stuff”? Or maybe you’ve found yourself unexpectedly hosting little coffee rituals wherever you go?

1jbl6qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jbl6qm/aita_for_expressing_my_frustrationanger_like_this/,Aita for expressing my frustration/anger like this?,"
It's 7am in the morning I (39m) am emptying and then stacking the dishwasher while I wait for the coffee to brew, before I leave for work at 8am. I want to leave the kitchen tidy for my wife (37f) and two kids (7/5) before I leave. I see rain is getting through the pergola roofing so i go outside to fix the dislodged timber that holds up the back of the raked roof. I say good morning to our (newly adopted) bird whose cage is under the pergola. As I go back inside she calls back loudly to me, i talk to it breifly and go back inside. Anyway back to dishes. 

My wife is woken up by the bird sounds and walks into the living room, ""good morning"" she croaks. ""Good morning baby"" I say back. she then goes outside to greet Ava joyfully, she loves that bird. I jokingly comment on how she greets me compared to the parrot.

While I'm doing the dishes she is outside and takes the sheet cover right off the cage like she normally does on a clear day, except today its raining alot. As i feel an urge to go to the bathroom, my wife calls out to me to move the large bird cage closer to the kitchen window away from the edge of the verandah, im like ""right now?"" (I am not quite ready for moving large furniture around I haven't had my morning bowel movement yet and the coffee is almost boiling) i say ""can you put the cover back on for now I need to go to the toilet first?"" she responds in a harsh loathing tone ""you always say that, you know what fine I'll do it my self!"" This angered me as it felt like it was designed to make me feel bad that I would not come and do her bidding when she demanded it without even considering my standpoint. Like It's either 'come help right now, or I hate you' kind-of-thing. I did not appreciate being treated like this. So I said ""Fine!"" And (out of character) stormed outside and angrily grabbed the table (that needed to be moved out of the way before the cage could be relocated near the kitchen window) and picked it up and moved it over aggressively then walked around the other side to move the other half of the table across, making space for the cage. My wife is looking/acting scared that I am angry. Like hypocrisy much? She is fine to play the aggressor on other occasions and say some of the meanest crap to get her way but if I show her some outward aggression (not physical towards her, I've never been physically violent towards her/hit her) she acts like I'm the bad guy.

We then together move the cage where she wanted it. (Ironically she got what she wanted in that moment). She then goes to bed and locks the door behind her. like wtf.

A few minutes later I knock and she unlocks  the door, I go get some clothes for work. While I'm there I say im sorry I scared you, she says I don't want to talk to you and rolls over in bed.

I know her father was physically abusive to her whole family growing up and feel I may have triggered her. I am not sure if she is geniunley afraid of me or using the situation to make me feel horrible (which i do, but im also upset at her the way she snarled and demandingly asks tasks of me). 

I regret my action because i think it may have ruined her day aswell as mine, when we should be a loving family who communicates healthily. 

I still think my wife was wrong in the way she calls on me and spoke to me/manipulatively in my opinion. There has got to be a better way to express my frustration at the way she talks to me sometimes and I am working on that everyday, I think about this stuff alot and am always trying to de-escalate or steer things when I see them going down a path that can get controversial. This time I slipped up.

I think i cutrently lack the charm and intellect to defuse these emotional spikes and need to take a concious decision in these moments to take a deep breath and choose my words and actions carefully.  I would appreciate if she would do something similar.  AITA? 

After reading this a few times i think so.

How do i fix this? Without enabling the un-cool behaviour by her? 

I love her and our children alot and want to be a normal, happy family that communicates well, respects and supports each other.

Sorry for the disjointed writing structure. Think I gave myself a stroke when I re-read it.

How can I break this habit? I measure my cream now and try not to go over 100 cal, but even then, I use 1 to 2 spoonfuls of sugar. Is their a substitute I can use I'm unaware of? This is literally my only bad habit. Otherwise, I'm oddly enough, not a sweet tooth. ",1,1742005643.0,diet,4,1.0,False

1jbl1xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1jbl1xx/6_food_helped_me_lose_40_lbs_after_years_of/,6 food helped me lose 40 lbs after years of struggling,"I stepped on the scale a couple days ago, and for the first time in years, I saw a number I’m proud of: 71kg (156 lbs). A “normal” BMI. Body fat at 17%. Two years ago, I was obese (BMI 31), living off pizza and cookie dough ice cream like it was a personality trait. I ruined my 20-year-old body, and I hated looking in the mirror. But today, I feel different. Lighter. Healthier. Not just physically, but mentally.

I wasted so much time on dumb fitness trends, pointless supplements, and ""magic"" diets that never worked. But when I finally cracked the code, everything changed. Losing weight wasn’t about suffering through endless workouts or cutting every carb - it was about getting smarter with my food and training. 80% diet, 20% exercise. And these were the foods that made it possible:

**- Oatmeal - basic but undefeated. Filling, healthy, and fixed my digestion.**

**- Chicken breast - obviously.**

**- Vegetables (i like tomatoes) - eat them, they matter.**

**- Protein shakes - easy, convenient, and great mixed with oats.**

**- Black coffee & tea - appetite control and energy boost in one.**

**- Protein bread - if you love bread but hate the carbs, this is the hack.**

Of course, food alone didn’t fix my mindset. Losing weight was just as much a mental battle as a physical one. My biggest breakthrough? Therapy. I didn’t want to admit I needed it, but my anxiety around food, exercise, and self-worth wasn’t going to solve itself. Here’s what actually helped me rewire my brain:

\- **Your thoughts lie to you. The fear of “failing” a diet is worse than actually messing up. One bad meal won’t ruin you. Obsessing over perfection will.**

**- Willpower is overrated. Habits and environment matter more. If you have junk food everywhere, you’ll eat it. Make your default choices healthy.**

**- Food guilt is pointless. You’re not “bad” for eating a cookie. The key is consistency, not punishment.**

My therapist also threw a bunch of book recs at me, and honestly, reading these changed everything. If you are in the same situation, these books are the next best thing:

**-** [**Grain Brain**](https://befreed.ai/book/grain-brain-by-david-perlmutter) **by David Perlmutter (Your brain might be addicted to the wrong foods)**

This book made me question everything I thought i knew about carbs. The author talks about how processed grains and sugars can mess with your brain, mood, and weight. If you’ve ever felt like your cravings are controlling you, this is a must-read.

**-** [**Burn**](https://befreed.ai/book/burn-by-herman-pontzer) **by Herman Pontzer (You can’t outwork a bad diet)**

This book completely changed how I see calories and metabolism. Pontzer, an evolutionary anthropologist, studied hunter-gatherer tribes and found that our bodies adapt to burn a set amount of calories no matter how much we move. It explains why exercise alone isn’t enough for fat loss - and why diet is king. Insanely eye-opening read.

**-** [**Built to Move**](https://befreed.ai/book/built-to-move-by-kelly-starrett) **by Kelly & Juliet Starrett (Make fitness sustainable)**

 A practical guide on how to move better, feel stronger, and prevent injuries. Helped me fix my form and mobility issues.

**- The Joy of Half a Cookie by Jean Kristeller (Stop emotional eating)**

If you’ve ever felt out of control around food, this book is a must-read. It teaches mindful eating techniques that actually work (no, it’s not just “eat slower”).

**- The Diet Fix by Yoni Freedhoff (Ditch all-or-nothing thinking)**

This book is for anyone who’s ever felt like they “failed” a diet. It’s all about breaking the cycle of restrictive eating and learning how to eat in a way you can sustain forever.

Looking back, I wish I had figured all this out sooner. The weight loss industry thrives on confusion, but the truth is simple: eat mostly whole foods, move consistently, and fix your mindset. If you’re struggling, I promise you’re not alone - but you have to take the first step. And if you don’t know where to start? Read. Learning about nutrition and psychology made all the difference for me. Hope it helps you too.",8,1742005491.0,Adulting,2,1.0,False

It's a very tragic fate. My Grandfather (her son) is in his late 70's currently. I don't talk to him very often, but my mother reaches out to him weekly and she seems to believe he is also experiencing some form of cognitive decline, asking her questions that he has already asked a bunch of times and such (though this short-term forgetfulness is not exactly uncommon in men his age and certainly not indicative of something serious). My personal inclination is that his lifestyle choices may have held off dementia to some degree. He owns his own piece of land in the Midwest and is constantly coming up with his own personal projects to improve upon it, such as building a fishing pond, building a well and this or that and the other, thus making him constantly physically active in his old age rather than just sitting around all day. He also reads voraciously and does logic puzzles like crossword and sudoku, which I am sure keeps his brain active instead of just watching tv or something. While I think these things have all definitely helped him, obviously what causes and prevents Alzheimer's/dementia has much more nuance to it. It also has made me terrified that I may one day experience this myself. I would hate for my children and grandchildren to have to see me in such a state where I don't even know them or who I am while shitting in diapers.

Like are you supposed to go ""ahh, stress gone""?","I'm still thinking about her. Quite daily, actually. We work like 25 minutes away from each other and she doesn't miss a month to walk past my work. In the beginning, she left me so confused, I thought about her every second of every day. I *needed* to see her. 5 months later, I *needed* to get over her. I would spend entire days just walking because that was the only thing that could get my mind off the obsession. 7 months later, I noticed I barely style my hair. 9 months later, therapy. 12 months later, could see my scalp. During this year, I was on living on takeout ramen and surprisingly, I forgot what I would eat for dinner. I don't remember if I ordered takeout for dinner or if I cooked at home every day. I know I cooked at home, but I don't remember what, which is scary. I had coffee every hour in between, perhaps 12 shots of espresso a day.

By late December 2024, I fixed my diet. By January 2025, stress ""began getting better"". I stopped walking those long walks and began going back to just doing what I used to do (although still thinking about her). Obsession would return every few weeks as I struggled to find back to who I was.

Now it's March. I still think and wonder about her, whether she'll walk past, but I no longer take those walks and I'm entirely back to doing what I used to do. I've still not found back socially. Still not making new connections. Still stuck in the past, but I'm not as panicky as I used to be. Occasionally, I'll reconsider hitting up the therapist for deeper questions about this whole episode, but it's not as acute as it used to be.

Things already tried: 
-change grind setting..tried multiple even though the same batch produced great coffee..well until it didn't.. suddenly.
- clean the grinder, moka pot etc nothing broken or deformed.
-replaced the gasket.
- tried tweaking heat, water temp.
- changed coffee brand..different roasts. Brought pre ground to try.
- finally ordered a new venus..it won't arrive for a few more days..I'm exhausted..welp! Why is this happening?

1jbkm60,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportforBetrayed/comments/1jbkm60/my_story/,My story,"My husband (50) and I (45) have been married for almost 8 years now. 3 months into our marriage I was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and told I had only 18 months to live. I have fought hard and traveled all over the US taking part in brain cancer trials. I have come close to death several times but always bounce back.

On September 26, 2023 I discovered that the man I married and praised, put high up on a pedestal because he appeared to be the most loving and supportive human being alive (He could have ran for the hills when I was diagnosed so early on in our marriage but he didn’t.) Wasn't the man I thought he was. He stayed but what I discovered on that day, completely flipped my world upside down. Destroying everything I believed in. Shattering me and our marriage. He had been having an affair. I should have been the one running for the hills but I wanted my marriage. I couldn’t picture my future without him in it. I loved him deeply and I tried to tell myself he only stepped out to escape the stress of our reality, of my being ill. 

I tried to tell myself that he truly loved me and I could forgive him as long as he did the work and showed remorse and it never happens again. For the next 8 months, I was ripped apart by not knowing what was real in our marriage and what was fake. I asked him many times for a full disclosure and he kept trickle truthing me. I would only get the truth out of him if and only when I had undeniable evidence and he would still try to wiggle out of it. Until I told him I was done. That’s when he came forward and disclosed that he had been cheating on me since before our marriage and with a total of 9 women. 

I was devastated once more. Feeling stuck because I had no where to go but also because I loved him. I stayed and kept trying to heal our marriage. He did try too at first. He changed his phone number, gave me all passwords to social media and bank accounts. I have full access to his phone and electronics. He installed Life360 and even changed jobs to work from home. None of it seemed to help me with the pain. 

A few months ago I asked him for a timeline of his infidelities and he promised he would. But still hasn't. I waited awhile and asked him again. I let him know how important it was to me because as of that point I had no timeline to go off of and believed everything in our marriage was fake and tainted. I still haven't received a timeline.

For the last year or so, I have watched nearly every self help video, every healing from betrayal video, countless hours of reading how to heal and rebuild, joined groups, did EMS online therapy, you name it and I have done it. He did some of it with me but never came to me to discuss what he’s doing on his own. So to me it looked as though he was doing nothing. 

I have been dealing with triggers, mind movies, nightmares all the things of PTSD trauma . I am extremely triggered by names. Yet,  I stayed and continued fighting for our marriage. 

The things he said to these women is unbelievable. I reached out to all of them and actually had coffee with one. I truly feel sorry for them. He lied and manipulated them just as much as he did me. They all had the exact same story. He told them that we were in an open marriage due to my health. He went as far as making an open marriage agreement and signed my name to prove it to them. He told them all that I am top priority and that he would never leave me. And he slept with each one of them once or twice. 

Most of these relationships lasted a year to 3 years and one of the women thought he loved her and moved from her home state of Michigan to Colorado to be with him and then moved from Colorado to Florida when we moved. Why? Because he told her he loved her.

He told most of them he never loved me and that he loved them. He also told them that he had to stay married to me legally or he wouldn’t get any of the malpractice suit when I die. ( that has been fixed legally, he gets absolutely NOTHING now) but it gets worse! He told them
 “I wish she would hurry up and die so we can be together “
 
I am disgusted and mentally damaged from that. But yet I stayed. In my mind, grasping on to any and everything possible to give me hope that he actually does love me and didn’t marry me for money and truly doesn’t want me dead. 

I convinced myself that it was limerence and he only said and done those things out of the stress and great sadness of watching his wife slowly die. He needed to escape his reality. He was hurting too and didn’t mean those words. Infidelity is common when one spouse is very ill. He couldn’t process what was happening. Right?  

After all, he’s still with me. He’s still here even though he knows he gets no money after I’m gone. Why would he stay with me? Why wouldn't he just divorce me if he didn't love me? 

I have cried so much that I have no more tears. I am exhausted from battling cancer and trying to fix a marriage he broke and that I had no choice in. I am so confused, so lost and completely shattered. I don't know what to do anymore.  Nothing seems to help. 

Sorry the post is so long but thank you for reading. Hopefully it's understandable.  ",8,1742004094.0,SupportforBetrayed,6,1.0,False
1jbklat,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jbklat/16_year_relationship_ended_out_of_the_blue/,16 year relationship ended out of the blue,"For the last 6 months my partner (30f) and myself (31m) had been doing long distance. She got a job in the location we were planning on moving and I was seeing out the end of my job/ potentially vesting period to have the stability to move and support our family should she decide to stay home once we started having kids. At the end of her holiday visit we were in the car running errands and I was feeling a tad down. I verbalized that I don't know why I'm feeling like this and was frustrated with myself that I couldn't enjoy the weekend before having to go back to work. I had been pushing myself very hard, high stress/high deliverables career with 50 hour weeks plus hellish commute, developed product and started a business on top of that, and managed my personal investments ( actively managed day to day), her investments/ retirement, and our shared investments. All the financial decision making was my responsibility, and I did things like purchasing/ selling shared vehicles, stratagizing credit cards, managing budgets etc. 

While i was sharing my feelings I was trying to understand why other people at work seemed so care free and not as stressed as I was, what I needed to change, and that ultimately I was doing to much. I was disappointed in myself for not being as on top of the business I had started, and looking back was just venting/ brainstorming trying figure out how I could feel better. During that brainstorming talking about my career I think I mentioned something about getting a contract for a few months elsewhere to gain the needed experience to move out to where she was. I do remember emphasizing that I needed to make the ""right"" decision, which looking back I was just putting too much pressure on myself, so that I would be confident i could support whatever family dynamic she wanted in the future. This conversation left us both feeling a bit down and the mood that evening at home was somber. I remember her heading out the door for yoga saying goodbye but not I love you, and I had to say it again that I love you hun for her to say love you too. We watched something on TV that evening, and her flight back home was early the next morning. She never said anything or tried to bring up the conversation again, or communicate how that made her feel before heading out for her flight. When she got home the first thing I text her was ""I'm feeling unsettled about what happened yesterday can we please talk about it"" and she said she was tired and we ended up just having a short call that evening to say goodnight and I love you. The work week started the next day and we are both busy during that time but still talk on the phone every night regularly falling asleep on the phone with a shared show or podcast. Again she never mentioned what happened before we left and I regret not digging more during the week to resolve it. 

Well Friday comes and I reach out to her and can immediately here the worst tone you could imagine in her voice. Without much conversation she says she can't do this anymore and feels too drained to continue on with our relationship without providing much detail. I'm obviously devastated as I feel completely blindsided because we didn't have any discussions about how she had been feeling for the last 6 months during our long distance. 

My world has completely crumbled, I've lost my best friend, my lover, my partner, and my entire future we've planned together for 16 years. Despite the high stress I was under our connection was still very strong. We went on daily walks together whether together or apart, had shared shows, had our own dance parties with each other at home, went and got coffee together every weekend and sat and talked for hours. We would walk our dog and talk for as long as most days would allow. Bundled up and went for walks in the snow, had evenings where we were both cracking up uncontrollably from whatever goofy things we were doing, and I always made sure we had quality time together. I admittedly had become more of a homebody from all the things I did on top of work, but still planned at least one weekend activity. Whether traveling to a new town nearby, taking her out on my motorcycle and grabbing a drink, going for a hike in a new place, or just something simple like getting takeout and ordering the ufc ppv. We never exchanged foul language, we're harsh with each other, and didn't have any of what people would consider toxic traits to our relationship. 

Our situation while living out there was not necessarily ideal, I was renting a condo from a family friend and we couldn't refurnish or decorate the place to our full liking and got minimal natural light do to the direction the apartment was facing. 

Well now she has completely pulled back from our relationship. All communication is on her terms ( it's very sparse and hasn't even aloud us the time to discuss the relationship). I have been on a roller coaster of hope and despair as one day we agree to take baby steps to move forward and the next she's ignoring me and engaging with things on social media about ""walking a spiritual path is accepting you don't know what you're doing"". I'm working my hardest to remain calm, and patient, respect the space she's asked for while also showing up for her and trying to prove that I'm willing to keep working at this. Sending her a very special valentines because I know she values little things, attending to her health and making sure she has the things she needs to still feel supported. 

I know I wasn't perfect in the relationship, I think very big picture and long term sometimes and things like holidays don't carry as much sentimental weight for me as they do her. The one thing I hate myself for is the last week she was there she wanted to go drive and see Christmas lights and I was locked in to investment work. I asked her is it ok if I focus on this as this could potentially help me move out to her sooner and be able to get settled into the life I thought we were both really looking forward to and she seemed like she understood. 

To put it lightly i am dying from the inside out now and my condition has continued to decline for the last two months since I called her that day. During our entire time out there she never once communicated with me about anything she had been struggling with and felt needed to change. I've been going insane thinking through all the little things I could have changed or done differently and can't live with myself for feeling like I let her and us down. We've had several amazing phone calls where we were both deeply connected but she seems to be pulling back more now and has been more anxious in recent calls. I'm working my ass off to grow for myself during these two months of separation to learn how to be a better partner, going to therapy, volunteer work, attending to my health best I can. I'm hurt so badly right now I feel like I don't want to be alive and she doesn't even bother to respond to texts. I'm not sure how I'll get through this...",3,1742004025.0,BreakUps,5,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jbkkgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyEatingnow/comments/1jbkkgj/fuel_multi_collagen_peptides_actually_works_heres/,Fuel Multi Collagen Peptides – Actually Works? Here’s My Experience,"I’ve always been curious about collagen supplements but wasn’t sure if they actually did anything or if they were just another wellness trend. After hearing mixed opinions, I finally decided to try one for myself. It’s only been a few weeks, but I think I’m starting to see some subtle improvements.

For context, I started taking collagen mainly for skin and joint health. Lately, my skin has been feeling drier than usual, and my knees have been a little stiff (probably from sitting too much). I went with a multi-collagen peptide formula because it includes several types (I, II, III, V, X), which are supposed to target different areas like skin, joints, and hair.

**What I’ve Noticed So Far:**

I wasn’t expecting much right away, but my skin does seem *a little* more hydrated. It’s not a drastic change, but I feel like I’m using less moisturizer, and my face looks a bit plumper. My nails, which usually chip easily, seem to be growing stronger too.

As for my joints, it’s too soon to tell if it’s making a major difference, but I *do* feel slightly less stiffness after sitting for long periods. One thing I really like is that the powder mixes well into my coffee—no clumps, no weird taste, and no gritty texture, which was a concern for me before trying it.

I’ve read that collagen can help with hair growth, but I haven’t noticed much change there yet. I also don’t expect overnight joint relief, so I’m curious to see if the improvements continue over the next few months.

**Questions for Long-Time Collagen Users:**

* How long did it take before you noticed any real difference?
* Do you take it with vitamin C? I’ve been doing that because I read it helps absorption, but I’m not sure how much of a difference it actually makes.
* Have you noticed collagen doing anything for gut health? Some people claim it does, but I don’t know if that’s just anecdotal.

Overall, I’m happy I gave it a shot. It’s been easy to add to my routine, and I’m seeing small but promising changes. Anyone else using collagen regularly or tried Fuel Multi Collagen Peptides ?

I never play Fortnite anymore and that was my favorite game in the world as I used to play it with an ex friend, so I would like to continue that with someone new and just make it my own thing.

I’m passionate about supporting small businesses. it’s the best way to discover new things and I’d rather buy for a cup of coffee or baked goods from a local place than crumbl or Starbucks (not too big on either anymore). I like going to concerts too. 

I’m in school for web development and design. I have adhd big time and I’m a huge overthinker and emotional person but I’m getting better at it.

for context im a 19 y/o woman, going to be 20 this year. im 5 foot even and last time i checked i was.. 340 lbs? around? DEFINITELY not good but since ive ALWAYS been overweight im just kinda.. desensitized from it, i guess? i was born heavy, and as time went on ive just kept gaining weight. ive done multiple diets throughout my life, with me even doing some in elementary school during the summer, but id always bounce back (obviously.) 

diabetes runs in my family on both sides, and a few doctors visits ago, i was diagnosed as prediabetic. definitely got an earfull from both parents but i honestly just wasn't bothered, like yeah it's bad but i kinda always knew it was going to happen, yknow? like there was no way i was going to lose damn near 100 pounds or be one of the VERY few people in our family who WASN'T going to have some kind of health issue. so nowadays, ive just been having a ""who cares it was gonna happen anyways"" mentality when it comes to eating and just pushing concerns about my weight to the back of my mind.

this video has brought it forward, though, and it has me really wishing i kept the will power i had years ago to stay on the vegan diet, the low carb diet, keto... i wish i still had it in me to tell myself no and to keep my word. i wish i never gave up the diet, and i wish i never had to diet at all and that i never developed a craving for the types of food that will literally be my downfall.

ive gotten a membership to my local ymca and ive gome a grand total of.... one time, this month. one, singular time. some days i plan on going and just get distracted and just dont go, but others i just feel discouraged, like seeing all the fit people in there keeping themselves fit and then there just being my obese self in there.. i feel out of place and worried that ill be looked at or used as ""motivation,"" i just dont go. i need to do better, to not care what people think and just go, but i know nothing won't change tomorrow 

i fear that maybe at this point there isn't even a point of turning a new leaf and losing weight. ill probably have a ton of excess skin, and with that nobody will see me as better looking, but for what i was before. i may be healthier, yeah, but id look horrid and skin removal surgery is expensive and im literally in college and fighting with my job in order to get hours as is.

i think a part of me wants to do the right thing, like i want to talk to someone professional about this because i know this is really a mental thing and i know im too far deep to do this alone, but the other part of me is just preaching that nothing will change, that i wont get any better and that any professional help i try to get will just be me throwing money away. ..i really dont want to be another case of someone whose 600 lbs, bedridden and just a lost cause, but i cant find it in myself to actively make a decision and change.

i dont even know why im even making this post honestly, i mean i know this IS the vent forum but i know what i need to do.. like ive done it before. i just dont think that i can do it again and keep at it ",4,1742003049.0,FoodAddiction,1,1.0,False

I don’t know if you’ll ever see this, and I don’t expect you to, but I need to write it anyway—just in case this is goodbye. This is my second attempt writing these words, but this is more for me.

I reached out after all these years because I wanted to apologize—not to rekindle anything or disrupt your life, but simply to say I was sorry. That weight had been with me for too long, and I thought you deserved to hear it. I meant every word. I wasn’t trying to put my struggles on you—I kept the heavier parts of my life to myself because this wasn’t about me. I only wanted to give you the peace of hearing what I felt you were owed.

You didn’t have to reply, but you did. Twice. And not just with polite acknowledgments—you shared details about your life, your work, your exhaustion, your situationship, your alternative path to what you expected—giving up what you had focused on for so long. You even told me about your dog. And you said you’d love to catch up if I were ever in the great Midwest. I didn’t ask for that. I never expected it. But I believed it. So, I replied.

Maybe part of me wonders if it wasn’t just life that got in the way, but something else. Maybe hearing that I had built a life, had moved forward, was harder than expected. I don’t say that to assume or accuse—I say it because I’ve seen how life can twist things in ways we never imagined. If that’s the case, I wish you knew that there was never any competition. I never reached out to compare lives, nor rub it in your face, only to apologise.

What happened in the past turned everything into a complicated mess, and we cut contact with a goodbye. Perhaps opening that door again brought back those emotions for you too. If that’s the case, I understand how difficult it must have been. But either way, you opened the door, and that’s something I have to reckon with.

I didn’t expect silence after you opened the door again. I don’t know what changed. Maybe you regretted opening up. Maybe life got in the way. Maybe your tone shift was a sign that something wasn’t right in your life, especially after you got the answers to the questions you asked me. I can’t help but wonder if you’ve been okay through it all. If not, I hope there’s someone you feel you can turn to, no pressure—it’s okay to let things sit until the moment feels right. Maybe I should have seen more when I wished you well. I just wish I had realized how much you might have needed to hear more. Maybe I was silly recommending Mojo Coffee near the Sears Tower and the Flat White to you. 

Four months passed, and I reached out again—not to push, not to demand, but just to check in. But silence remained. How would you even know if I had a layover or stopover in the Midwest?

I don’t blame you. I just wish I understood.

Once, a long time ago, we talked for hours in the cold, walking that dog through the snow. I made you laugh so hard, and when I saw you smile, it felt effortless—like we had known each other forever. Someone even noticed and commented more than once. She was the one who asked us to walk that dog in the first place.

But it wasn’t you who kept watching me from a distance over the years—it was her. For many years, I saw that she was checking my social media. I deleted everything by 2018. Whatever she was doing I have no idea. 

I did ask how you were. I told you to take care, to look after yourself. I wished you good health. But I missed something. I can’t shake the feeling that I might have missed something important.

Still, I’m glad I reached out. Because no matter what, I meant everything I said. You once mattered to me, and in some way, you always will. You’ll always be the awesome and cool person I met back in 2005 at that event in Connecticut that November. Even though I was in your world only briefly—like a shooting star flashing across the night sky—your memory will always have that same impact of wonder and amazement.

But now, I’ll let go. I won’t reach out again. If you ever want to reach me, you know where to find me. But I can’t be the one to keep reaching out. You chose silence—and that is deafening. Like being dragged through the nine circles of hell Dante was always going on about. Maybe this is just me speaking in circles too, but there’s a weight in this silence that I can’t ignore anymore.

Take care, A. Truly.

I wasn’t trying to put my struggles on you—I kept the heavier parts of my life to myself because this wasn’t about me. I only wanted to give you the peace of hearing what I felt you were owed.

You didn’t have to reply, but you did. Twice. And not just with polite acknowledgments—you shared details about your life, your work, your exhaustion, your situationship, your alternative path to what you expected—giving up what you had focused on for so long. You even told me about your dog. And you said you’d love to catch up if I were ever in the great Midwest. I didn’t ask for that. I never expected it. But I believed it. So, I replied.

Maybe part of me wonders if it wasn’t just life that got in the way, but something else. Maybe hearing that I had built a life, had moved forward, was harder than expected. I don’t say that to assume or accuse—I say it because I’ve seen how life can twist things in ways we never imagined. If that’s the case, I wish you knew that there was never any competition. I never reached out to compare lives, nor rub it in your face, only to apologise.

What happened in the past turned everything into a complicated mess, and we cut contact with a goodbye. Perhaps opening that door again brought back those emotions for you too. If that’s the case, I understand how difficult it must have been. But either way, you opened the door, and that’s something I have to reckon with.

I didn’t expect silence after you opened the door again. I don’t know what changed. Maybe you regretted opening up. Maybe life got in the way. Maybe your tone shift was a sign that something wasn’t right in your life, especially after you got the answers to the questions you asked me. I can’t help but wonder if you’ve been okay through it all. If not, I hope there’s someone you feel you can turn to, no pressure—it’s okay to let things sit until the moment feels right. Maybe I should have seen more when I wished you well. I just wish I had realized how much you might have needed to hear more. Maybe I was silly recommending Mojo Coffee near the Sears Tower and the Flat White to you. 

Four months passed, and I reached out again—not to push, not to demand, but just to check in. But silence remained. How would you even know if I had a layover or stopover in the Midwest?

I don’t blame you. I just wish I understood.

Once, a long time ago, we talked for hours in the cold, walking that dog through the snow. I made you laugh so hard, and when I saw you smile, it felt effortless—like we had known each other forever. Someone even noticed and commented more than once. She was the one who asked us to walk that dog in the first place.

But it wasn’t you who kept watching me from a distance over the years—it was her. For many years, I saw that she was checking my social media. I deleted everything by 2018. Whatever she was doing I have no idea. 

I did ask how you were. I told you to take care, to look after yourself. I wished you good health. But I missed something. I can’t shake the feeling that I might have missed something important.

Still, I’m glad I reached out. Because no matter what, I meant everything I said. You once mattered to me, and in some way, you always will. You’ll always be the awesome and cool person I met back in 2005 at that event in Connecticut that November. Even though I was in your world only briefly—like a shooting star flashing across the night sky—your memory will always have that same impact of wonder and amazement.

But now, I’ll let go. I won’t reach out again. If you ever want to reach me, you know where to find me. But I can’t be the one to keep reaching out. You chose silence—and that is deafening. Like being dragged through the nine circles of hell Dante was always going on about. Maybe this is just me speaking in circles too, but there’s a weight in this silence that I can’t ignore anymore.

Take care, A. Truly.

I have-or just recently had-a friend, with whom shared a lot of views, liked the same stuff, and the creative & spiritual types. My husband and I, on our rare day off together, dropped by for a couple of hours to give her a Christmas whatsoever. 

Geez: I go one day in silence & she freaks out and proceeds to give me silent treatment the next. It was a heavy, busy day. The kicker is that not only did she overreact /refuse to understand, but acted punitive toward me-like an entitled mother who thinks she’s being ignored-and decided to claim it was 3 days, which was not. I work; she’s retired. She proceeded to take time out, meet for lunch (but I only had coffee), acted like she was glad to hear from & see me again. 

Yesterday, she decides that the friendship isn’t doable; ok-who cares if we have different backgrounds & lives? Her excuse is a cop-out! Yes, I have her what she wanted: end of friendship, but still feel wronged by her.

1jbk0cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Hefty-Option-4685/comments/1jbk0cn/understanding_the_difference_between_seo_and/,Understanding The Difference Between SEO and Google Business,"When someone searches for a business online, they don’t just want a website—they want immediate, useful information. That’s where SEO and Google Business comes in. You might be wondering what the difference between SEO and Google Business is. Well, to put it simply, SEO helps websites rank in search results, and Google Business ensures businesses appear in local searches with details like location, reviews, and contact info.

Many business owners assume these tools are interchangeable, but they serve different purposes. Understanding their strengths will help you make smarter marketing decisions. 

Whether you’re looking to attract a global audience or dominate local search results, knowing the difference between SEO and Google Business will give you a competitive edge.

# Why Digital Marketing Tools Matter

The internet has changed how businesses attract customers.

People no longer rely on word-of-mouth alone; they search online for reviews, locations, and services before making decisions. This shift makes digital marketing tools essential for growth. 

SEO and Google Business are two of the most powerful tools, but they serve different purposes. When you understand their roles, you will be able to reach the right audience more effectively.

# SEO And Google Business: Key Tools For Success

So, SEO vs Google Business Profile, which should you go for? SEO (Search Engine Optimization) helps businesses get found online by improving their website’s visibility in search results. When someone searches for a product or service, SEO ensures that a business appears at the top. 

Google Business, now known as Google Business Profile, focuses on local searches, location, and reviews. 

While SEO boosts a website’s ranking across search engines, Google Business enhances local visibility. Using both together creates a well-rounded digital marketing strategy that connects businesses with the right audience at the right time.

# What Is SEO?

SEO is all about making sure your website gets found when people search for topics related to your business. Think of it as a way to help search engines understand your content so they can show it to the right audience.

The goal? When someone searches for a product or service you offer, your website should show up on the first page of search results, increasing your chances of getting more visitors and potential customers.

# The Basics Of SEO

SEO has three main components: 

* **On-page SEO:** On-page SEO involves optimizing your website’s content, including using relevant keywords, structuring pages with clear headings, and ensuring internal links connect related content. It helps search engines understand what your website is about.

* **Off-page SEO:** This focuses on building credibility by getting backlinks from other reputable websites. The more quality links pointing to your website, the more trustworthy search engines consider it to be.

* **Technical SEO:** Technical SEO ensures your website functions smoothly. It includes improving page speed, making your site mobile-friendly, and ensuring search engines can properly crawl and index your pages.

# Benefits Of Implementing SEO Strategies

* **Increased website traffic:** Higher rankings bring more visitors to a website.
* **Better credibility:** Search engines favor trusted websites with strong content and links.
* **Improved user experience:** Good SEO practices make sites easier to navigate and faster to load.

# What Is Google Business?

Google Business Profile is like your business’s digital storefront on Google. It’s a free tool that helps businesses control how they appear in Google Search and Maps, making it easier for customers to find them. 

Whether you're a local coffee shop, a boutique, or a service provider, having an up-to-date Google Business Profile ensures potential customers see key details like your location, contact information, hours, and reviews. 

For small businesses, this tool acts as a direct line to nearby customers searching for your services in real-time.

# Setting Up Your Google Business Profile

1. Create a profile at Google Business Profile.
2. Verify your business via phone, email, or mail.
3. Add key details like business name, address, phone number, and hours.
4. Upload photos of your location, products, or services.
5. Encourage customer reviews and respond to them regularly.

# The Advantages Of Using Google Business

* **Boosts visibility in local searches** \- Your business appears when people search for services near them.

* **Builds trust through customer reviews** \- Positive reviews increase credibility and attract more customers.

* **Shares important business details** \- Customers can quickly find your hours, location, and contact info.

* **Improves presence on Google Maps** \- Helps customers navigate to your business easily.

# SEO vs. Google Business: Key Differences

Search Engine Optimization helps businesses rank in search results to attract a broad audience, while Google Business boosts local visibility on Google Search and Maps. SEO is great for long-term growth, Google Business, on the other hand, helps businesses connect with nearby customers quickly. Using both together ensures maximum reach and impact.

# SEO: Broader Online Reach

Businesses can reach a broad audience by ensuring their website appears in search results when people look for products or services. When someone searches online, search engines analyze the website’s content, keywords, and structure to determine relevance. 

By optimizing these elements, businesses increase their chances of attracting visitors, even if they are located in different cities or countries.

# Google Business: Localized Visibility

Google Business helps businesses connect with nearby customers by improving their local search visibility. When someone searches for a service, Google prioritizes businesses with complete and optimized profiles. 

A well-maintained profile includes accurate business details, updated photos, and regular customer interactions through reviews and posts.

If someone searches “coffee shop near me,” a fully optimized Google Business Profile increases the chances of appearing in the top results, making it easier for potential customers to find and engage with the business.

# When To Use SEO vs. Google Business

Choosing between SEO and Google Business depends on your goals. SEO helps build long-term visibility and attracts a broader audience, while Google Business connects you with local customers who need immediate services. Using both together ensures your business reaches the right people at the right time.

# Leveraging SEO For Long-Term Growth

Building long-term visibility means consistently improving your website's SEO. This involves optimizing content, using relevant keywords, and earning backlinks to boost credibility. 

While it takes time, SEO leads to steady, sustainable traffic growth and helps businesses establish a strong online presence.

# Using Google Business For Immediate Local Reach

Local businesses, such as restaurants, salons, and retail stores, can quickly attract nearby customers by optimizing their Google Business Profile. Keeping business details accurate and up to date, responding to reviews, and posting updates help businesses appear in local search results when potential customers look for their services.

To maximize visibility, businesses should use local SEO tools for small businesses alongside Google Business Profile. Tools like Google Search Console, Moz Local, and BrightLocal help track search performance, keyword rankings, and local citations, ensuring businesses stay competitive.

Combining Google Business optimization with local SEO tools creates an immediate connection with customers, boosts foot traffic, and strengthens trust within the community—helping small businesses grow their local presence effectively.

# Combining SEO And Google Business For Optimal Results

For businesses looking to maximize their online visibility, combining SEO strategies for Google Business with traditional SEO efforts delivers the best results. Each tool serves a unique purpose—SEO enhances website rankings and attracts organic traffic, while Google Business Profile strengthens local search visibility for location-based businesses.

# Role of Google My Business In SEO

Optimizing your Google Business Profile with relevant keywords, accurate business details, and high-quality images improves local search rankings. Google prioritizes well-optimized listings, meaning businesses that apply strong SEO strategies for Google Business are more likely to appear in local search results, Google Maps, and the Local Pack.

# Using Both For Maximum Growth

A balanced approach involves:

* Implementing on-page and off-page SEO to rank higher in organic search results.
* Optimizing your Google Business Profile with keyword-rich descriptions, updated business details, and positive customer engagement.
* Encouraging customer reviews and responding to queries to boost credibility and rankings.

# Key Takeaways: SEO vs. Google Business

* Optimize website SEO to improve organic search rankings.
* Maintain an updated Google Business Profile to rank in local searches.
* Use local SEO tools for small businesses like Moz Local or BrightLocal to track rankings.
* Encourage customer reviews to boost trust and visibility.
* Add posts and updates on Google Business to engage with potential customers.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I'll take some on an espresso with whipped cream!” - they tip like $1.45 even if everything is still perfect. the happiness isn't considerably lower or anything, it takes maybe 2 seconds to place the toppings.

1jbjt3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trumpvirus/comments/1jbjt3l/read_and_share/,Read and share..,"WHEN A FORMER KGB CHIEF SHARES YOUR ARTICLE—AND THE AMERICAN MEDIA IS STILL ASLEEP

Something bizarre just happened. Something that proves independent journalism is doing what the corporate press refuses to do.

A couple of weeks ago, Closer to the Edge published an article https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1CKheuemjf/ calling out CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and every other major news outlet for ignoring what should be one of the biggest geopolitical bombshells in modern history:

Alnur Mussayev, former head of Kazakhstan’s intelligence service, claimed that Donald Trump has been a Russian asset since 1987—operating under the KGB codename “Krasnov.”

That’s the kind of story that should set off alarm bells in every newsroom across the country. But instead? Silence.

So we did what the mainstream press wouldn’t—we wrote about it. And then things took a turn we never saw coming.

THE STRANGE CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT GOT THIS STORY TO MUSSAYEV

After our article was published, Facebook user Volodymyr Vlad Kunko copied and pasted it, added his own introduction, and shared it in this post:  https://www.facebook.com/share/p/18wkwvGX9R/

Here's what Volodymyr wrote before the article:

""I’m calling it as it is. I don’t care whether you agree with me or not, just check your response with your gut. My gut never lies to me.

I’ve had my suspicions all along about this stooge. He’s not intelligent enough to pull this off by himself. We better hope that all the social security numbers and tax info that Muskrat just uploaded from SSA and IRS from every single American citizen’s account doesn’t end up in Putin’s files. Whoever has that info can potentially wipe out every dime we have and can potentially fund a world takeover.""

Shortly after that, Casey Këddington copied Volodymr’s version, word-for-word, and posted it into a Facebook group called ""The United States Academy, for Democracy, Diplomacy, & the Power Of Voting."" Here’s his post: https://www.facebook.com/share/p/167Zn3ad52/

That’s when something incredible happened.

Alnur Mussayev—the very former intelligence chief we wrote about—saw this version, translated the article into Russian, and shared it on his own page.

Yes, the former KGB officer we were writing about read the article and thought it was important enough to share.

Here’s Mussayev’s post: Mussayev’s Russian-translated version:
https://www.facebook.com/alnurKZ/posts/pfbid04SWBbbXPwESpnjaiVRuhQbeMUX5ptScxHfjzQ9e2UicUFgukHsGiiC4HhLRW8EFMl

Meanwhile, The Daily Beast briefly ran a story on Mussayev’s claims—then deleted it. No correction, no retraction, just wiped from existence. Why?

THE AMERICAN MEDIA JUST GOT OUTREPORTED BY FACEBOOK USERS AND A FORMER SPY

Imagine being The New York Times or CNN right now. Imagine spending years breathlessly covering Trump-Russia stories, and then, when an actual former intelligence chief makes the clearest accusation yet, you miss it entirely.

Imagine being so behind the ball that random Facebook users and an ex-KGB officer are more on top of global intelligence than your entire newsroom.

Mussayev sharing this article isn’t just validation—it’s proof that independent journalism is now doing the job the corporate media refuses to do.

This isn’t just about us. This is about all of you—the readers, the sharers, the subscribers, the people who push these stories into the world when the mainstream press won’t.

Because let’s be real:

We wrote the article, but it was your engagement that spread it.

We investigated the story, but it was your shares that made sure the right people saw it.

We called out the media, but it was your support that made it impossible for them to ignore.

This isn’t just a victory for us—it’s a victory for every single person who refuses to let the truth be buried.

CLOSER TO THE EDGE HAS BEEN SEEN OVER 100,000,000 TIMES IN THE PAST 90 DAYS.

That’s 100,000,000 moments where independent journalism has reached people in ways the corporate press has failed.

This is what happens when people decide they don’t need The New York Times or CNN to tell them what’s important.

Every share, every subscription, every comment, every small contribution fuels this movement.

The media won’t chase the truth unless we force them to.

And that’s exactly what we’re going to do.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? KEEP PUSHING.

This story isn’t over. If anything, it’s just getting started.

Here’s what you can do right now to keep it moving:

1️⃣ Share this article—everywhere. Facebook, X, Reddit, anywhere people talk about news.

2️⃣ Tag news outlets and demand coverage. CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, The Washington Post—make them answer why they’re ignoring this.

3️⃣ Tell independent journalists. Reporters like Matt Taibbi, Glenn Greenwald, Ryan Grim, Aaron Maté—they live for stories like this. Send it to them. Flood their inboxes.

4️⃣ Subscribe & Support. If you want independent journalism to keep doing what the mainstream media won’t, become a paid subscriber or even buy us a coffee. Every dollar goes toward keeping these stories alive.

FINAL THOUGHT: THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING

The mainstream media wants to ignore this. But the more we push, the harder it becomes for them to pretend it’s not happening.

They don’t want to admit that independent journalism is leaving them in the dust.

But we are.

And we’re just getting started.

1jbjsua,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jbjsua/would_you_use_an_espresso_rating_app_with/,Would you use an espresso rating app with detailed criteria instead of generic stars?,"Hey r/espresso,

I’m working on an idea for a mobile app and would love to get some feedback from serious coffee enthusiasts.

Most rating apps like Google and Yelp use generic star ratings that assess the entire café rather than just the coffee, missing the nuances of a great espresso. What if there were a dedicated espresso rating app where users could evaluate coffee shops based on specific criteria?

Proposed Rating System:

Instead of just giving a place 4/5 stars, you’d score espressos based on these mandatory ratings:

* Crema (-2 to +2) → Too thin? Too thick? Just right?
* Aroma (-2 to +2) → Lacking depth? Perfectly balanced?
* Taste (-2 to +2) → Sour? Bitter? Sweet?
* Body (-2 to +2) → Too watery? Too heavy?

Example rating:

* Crema: -1 (slightly too thin)
* Aroma: 0 (ideal)
* Taste: -1 (slightly too sour)
* Body: -2 (too watery)

Users could filter cafés based on these attributes rather than vague overall ratings.

Potential Features:

* Espresso reviews displayed on a map (Google Maps API).
* Search by highest-rated crema, aroma, or body.
* Public & private rating systems (e.g., home baristas could track their own extractions).
* Offline mode for saving café recommendations when traveling.
* Instead of an aroma score, there could be an optional aroma tag with options like chocolate, nutty, citrus, etc. one could add to the rating.

Concerns:

* Google Maps API costs can be high, and OpenStreetMap lacks detailed place data, maybe MapBox is a possible alternative.
* Would enough people use a dedicated espresso rating app, or is this too niche?

Your Thoughts?

* Would you use an app like this?
* Do these rating categories make sense, or would you add/change something?
* Do you think espresso-focused ratings would provide better recommendations than generic stars?

Looking forward to hearing your feedback!

People often assume all variables are relevant for dialling in and as a result try to fidget with them with limited success.

Similar to the dialling in by taste chart, I’m thinking of making a process chart and opening the floor to some suggestions. Idea is to have:

1. Input variables: this is things like beans, equipment (machine, grinder, baskets), set up, water, which can influence the process. Framing that we are working with and around the input variables to make a good coffee.

2. Hygiene: these are things that can be done right or wrong, but there is almost no scope to tweak these. Most often these are the problem areas. Things like dosing for appropriate volume fill, sufficient tamp pressure, puck prep

3. Shot parameters: your usual grind size, ratio, yield, shot time, pressure profile

4. Taste / output: effectively the feedback loop for the espresso dialling in chart

We have a large coffee table that is pushed up against the couch to give him more floor space. Well today he decided to speed crawl from on the couch to the coffee table and his arm went into open space between the two and he hit his cheek bone on the table. I'm nauseous with guilt and from the sound playing over and over in my head. He cried for a couple minutes before I was able to sooth him, but almost immediately he had a blueish people bruise show up on his cheek . He was acting pretty normal for a while but after a couple hours he got increasingly fussy and was crying a lot. The trouble is that he has been showing signs of teething for a couple days now so it isn't totally out of character. It still felt like it was worse than usual. 
We checked his pupils and they're fine, he spat up a couple times but that's still a daily thing so I also don't know if that's vomiting or just the usual spit up. The fussiness started right before bedtime so my husband and I said we'll monitor overnight. So currently baby is asleep in my arms, he had most of a bottle and hasn't spat up anything. 
Dr Google says that sleep and rest are vital for the first 24-48 hours, but I'm also so scared to not take him to the er and miss some sort of window? I think unless the bruise is magically gone and overnight and tomorrow he is 100% we'll be taking him in anyway. 
Or do I wake him to go right away because of the fussiness?

Casual relationships, FWBs are not widely common either. In romantic relationships people mostly and specially women are kind of reserved and only get physically intimate in a commited relationship. I am no different but I don't mind sex when I am actually dating someone for real. So when this aqua guy, shared his interest and lusty nature for sex I am not judging him yet and also I understand that he trusted me enough to share that as people easily get judged for being vocal about sexual needs in our country culture.

1jbji3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/1jbji3j/supervisor_asked_me_to_brainstorm_accommodation/,Supervisor asked me to brainstorm accommodation ideas- I'm lost,"Hi everyone, first post here after reading just about everything in here obsessively for days. I'm looking for your suggestions and advice because I just don't know what to do and I feel so lost.

I was diagnosed with IH in 2023 but was/am ttc and didn't want to risk potential fetal harm (at this point I'm desperate enough to go back on this). In August 2024, I got a job that's absolutely perfect for me- I do very well, feel appreciated, and M-F 8:30a-5p has helped me maintain a healthier schedule. I go to bed at a consistent time, get 7-9 hours of sleep, and can enjoy evenings with my husband of 4 years.

For the past 2 ish months, I've been getting progressively worse. At first I was waking up dizzy and disoriented. Then also taking naps and drinking coffee all day instead of eating lunch. Now I'm also completely sleeping through multiple loud alarms and I've been up to 2 hours late to work in the past few weeks. I'm beyond embarrassed because this isn't who I am- I'm a good consistent employee, I go above and beyond, I'm cheerful and friendly.... just not anymore. Now I'm late, barely doing my assigned work, isolating at my desk, and I haven't even had the time in the morning to shower and look presentable. I can't lose this job, the hope of free college (it's a university hospital) is just about the only thing I'm holding onto. Before my exhaustion became extreme, I was planning on getting a degree in my department. Now I'm worried I won't even make it to the summer without getting fired. 

Last week, I opened up to my supervisor about having IH and let him know that I am trying to be better. Today I went back to him, crying, because nothing I've done has helped. I'm so embarrassed and ashamed. He was very supportive and has reached out to HR to see what options he has. He suggested I brainstorm what accommodations I think would be reasonable, and he could reach back out to HR with them. One example he gave was changing my hours to 9-5:30, but we both know that wouldn't exactly help since I've been 2 hours late before. His suggestion would be great, except that I'm completely lost here. I have no idea what to ask for or what can even help. I just want to cry because I feel like a train wreck in slow motion, utterly helpless and tragic. 

Tldr: I'm open to any and all accommodation suggestions because I've never asked for these before.",5,1742000646.0,idiopathichypersomnia,6,1.0,False

If there’s one universal truth in this world, it’s that haters are gonna hate. It doesn’t matter what you do—whether you launch the next big thing, make a groundbreaking discovery, or simply decide to eat pineapple on pizza (which, let’s be honest, is delicious)—somebody, somewhere, is going to throw shade. And if you’re into Bitcoin? Oh, you better believe the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) brigade is out in full force.

But here’s the thing: Bitcoiners don’t have time for haters. We’re too busy stacking sats, securing the network, and making transactions easier than ever. Enter **our Bitcoin QR Code Maker**—the tool that lets you send and receive BTC like a boss. No typing in long, confusing wallet addresses, no mix-ups, no fuss. Just scan, send, and boom—another permissionless, borderless, unstoppable Bitcoin transaction. Check it out here: [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

# The Haters Always Doubt, Bitcoin Always Wins

Let’s take a moment to appreciate the sheer persistence of Bitcoin haters. They’ve been predicting Bitcoin’s demise since it was a few cents.

“It’s a bubble!” they cried in 2011.

“It’s a scam!” they shouted in 2013.

“It’ll never hit $1,000!” they declared in 2017—right before it rocketed to $20,000.

“It’s dead for real this time,” they insisted during every dip.

And yet, here we are, over a decade into Bitcoin’s journey, with institutional adoption, global acceptance, and a network that has never been hacked. Meanwhile, some of those haters have quietly started stacking BTC themselves. (We see you, Peter Schiff's son.)

# Making Transactions Simple: No More Copy-Paste Headaches

Even though Bitcoin has proven itself time and again, let’s be real: sending transactions the old-fashioned way—manually copying and pasting wallet addresses—can be a pain. One wrong character, and your BTC is sent into the void, never to be seen again.

That’s why QR codes are a game-changer. With our Bitcoin QR Code Maker, you just enter your wallet address, generate a scannable code, and boom—anyone can send you Bitcoin with a quick scan. No errors, no headaches, just smooth and easy transactions. Whether you’re accepting BTC for your business, sending funds to a friend, or just flexing your Bitcoin acceptance at a coffee shop, QR codes make life a whole lot easier.

# Bitcoin Adoption: Leaving the Haters in the Dust

Every revolution has its skeptics. Remember when people scoffed at the idea of the internet? “Why would anyone buy books online when they can go to a bookstore?” (RIP Borders.) The same thing is happening with Bitcoin. The haters might laugh now, but in ten years, they’ll be the ones awkwardly asking you how to set up a wallet.

Bitcoin adoption is growing, and tools like our QR Code Maker make it even easier. Businesses can quickly create a Bitcoin payment code, slap it on their checkout counter, and start accepting Bitcoin in minutes. Travelers can use it to accept BTC abroad without worrying about fiat exchange rates. Freelancers can get paid instantly without dealing with banks and middlemen. The possibilities are endless.

# QR Codes: Not Just for Payments

Beyond payments, QR codes have some seriously cool use cases in the Bitcoin world. Want to back up your wallet seed phrase in a scannable format? QR code. Want to create an easy way to donate Bitcoin to a cause you support? QR code. Want to prank your no-coiner friend by making a QR code that sends them to a Bitcoin price chart? QR code (highly recommended, by the way).

And if you really want to get creative, you can turn your Bitcoin QR code into a piece of art, print it on a t-shirt, or engrave it on a metal plate. Imagine a future where your great-great-grandkids find an old QR code you left behind, scan it, and discover a long-lost Bitcoin fortune. That’s generational wealth, baby.

# The Future is Bitcoin (No Matter What the Haters Say)

Bitcoin is here to stay. Whether you’re stacking, transacting, or just getting started, tools like our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker** make it easier than ever to be part of the revolution. So let the haters do their thing—they’ll come around eventually. Meanwhile, you can focus on what really matters: using Bitcoin, living free, and having fun doing it.
