I (23F) and my boyfriend “Alex” (26M) have been together for almost half a decade. We met when I moved to the US from the Netherlands chasing the *American Dream*. New country, new life, new everything. We clicked instantly. We moved in together fast. I thought I found my person.

But from early on, we realized we were… really different.

Money was always an issue. I paid for groceries, utilities, daily expenses. He paid for dates. The thing is, we got groceries weekly but only went on dates once a month, and I was always the one stretched thin. I was in college at this time, and he had a full time job. Whenever I brought it up, it turned into a fight about fairness.

Then he became unhappy with his job. I helped him prep for interviews, supporting him through everything. He eventually got a new job… in another state. He moved. Broke our lease. And suddenly we were long distance.

During that time, I was applying to post-grad programs. I hit a low point where it looked like I might not get in. I floated the idea that I might have to go back to my home country to finish school.

That’s when he told me:  
**If I didn’t get into school in the US, he couldn’t see our relationship continuing.**  
Long distance was already “too much” for him.

My school advisors joked that marriage is the easiest way to stay and get into school here. We’d been together almost 3 years at that point. Marriage was always brushed off. I get it—you shouldn’t marry for visas. Still, it hurt.

I cried for days. Tried harder than I ever have in my life. And somehow… I got in.

I thought things would finally get better.

They didn’t.

We stayed long distance. He met my friends once, and they immediately disliked him because at dinner he told me I “didn’t need to get x, y, z” and tried to control what I ate. That was just the beginning.

Over time, he started criticizing everything about me:

* My clothes aren’t nice enough
* I look terrible
* My skin is bad
* I need to work out
* I should “try harder” because he has “options” where he lives

He’s told me people stare at *him* on trains. That women ask him out for “professional coffee chats.” That I should look better because he has many choices.

I started spending money I didn’t have—on clothes, skincare, home items—because he made me feel guilty for not meeting his standards. As usual, I spend most of my loan budget on things he wants for me, not for myself. 

During school, the emotional toll crushed me. I cried constantly because no matter what I did, there was *always* something wrong with me. And yet always make it about him, and he’d say he was miserable.

At one point, I was completely broke. My loans were delayed, and I had no money left. I accidentally used his card on an app because our cards differ by a number (I didn’t even realize it). He screamed at me, accused me of trying to steal from him, said I was using him.

When he realized it was a mistake, he didn’t apologize. He doubled down—said he couldn’t be with someone “so aloof” with money (I admit I struggle with finances).

My overdraft got so bad I couldn’t afford rent or bus fare to my part-time job. I asked him for $300 just so I could get to work and clear the overdraft.

He said no.

A friend helped me instead.

Then visa issues came up. There’s a chance I’ll have to leave the US for two years after the visa is up. Marriage came up again.

He freaked out. Said our relationship is stagnant. That marriage is impossible.

I finally worked up the courage to ask for a breakup. I told him I felt like every time I hit rock bottom, he never stood by me emotionally or practically.

He told me I was selfish.  
That I shouldn’t leave him when he has no friends.  
That we should’ve broken up *earlier* when he still had friends. (last year). I mean even his roommates dislike him because he blows up over random things.

Whenever I bring up my pain, he redirects it to how *he* is more miserable. How he wasted his prime years with me. How he got “fucked over” by staying in this relationship.

One night, he told me something that kinda broke me.

He said he feels like a loser. That even though there are many women where he lives, he could never get with them. That he should be grateful he at least has *me* to text while he’s miserable. That he knows he treats me unkindly, but he’ll “learn to shut down his judgment and disgust” toward me so our relationship can survive.

That made me feel like absolute shit.

I don’t want to be with someone who’s only with me because they have no other options.

But he’s been in my life for almost a quarter of my life. I don’t know how to leave. My social network in the US is basically his friends. I’ve also kind of lost touch with friends back home.

I feel trapped. I want to leave and learn to love myself. I also feel that I wasted my best years stuck in this mentally abusive relationship, and can't find the strength to leave. ",1,1767190022.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1q0dsfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1q0dsfk/my_girlfriend_left_me_because_i_was_a_loser_4/,"My girlfriend left me because I was a loser, 4 months later I’m unrecognizable.","

Four months ago my girlfriend of 3 years left me and told me i was going nowhere with my life. She was right and it destroyed me.

I’m 25 now but back then i was working at a call center making $15/hour, living in a shitty studio apartment, playing video games every night until 3am. Had been doing this for 2 years straight with zero ambition to change anything.

For privacy reasons we’ll call her Sarah. Now, Sarah and i had been together since college. She graduated, got a real job at a marketing firm, started building an actual career. I dropped out junior year and just… stopped trying. Got the call center job because it was easy and remote. Told myself i was “figuring things out” but really i was just comfortable being mediocre.

She tried to push me for years. Asked when i was gonna look for better jobs. Asked why i gamed every single night instead of doing anything productive. Asked if i even had goals anymore. I’d always say yeah i’m working on it, i’ll figure it out soon. Never did.

# What broke me.

We were supposed to go to her company dinner. Some fancy thing where all her coworkers brought their partners. I said i’d go but the day of i just didn’t feel like it. Told her i wasn’t feeling well and she should go without me.

She came back around 11pm and i was in the middle of a ranked valorant game. Didn’t even try and pay any attention to her when she walked in. Just said ‘hey how was it” while still playing.

She stood there watching me for like a minute. Then she said “I can’t do this anymore”

I paused the game and looked at her. She had tears in her eyes and said “you’re 25 years old and you’re going nowhere. You work a dead end job you hate, you play games every night, you have no ambition, no goals, nothing. I can’t watch you waste your life anymore.”

I tried to argue but she kept going. “everyone at dinner tonight asked about you. Asked what you do, where you work, what your plans are. And i had nothing to say. Because you’re not doing anything. You’re just… existing.”

“I love you but i can’t be with someone who’s given up on themselves. I need a partner who’s actually trying to build something. And you’re not that person anymore.”

She packed a bag that night and left. Moved back in with her parents. Broke up with me over text two days later saying she needed a clean break.

**Rock bottom**

The first week after she left i barely functioned. Called in sick to work for 3 days. Just laid in bed or played games. Ordered food, let trash pile up, didn’t even bother to shower

My apartment still had her stuff everywhere. Her shampoo in the bathroom, her hoodies i used to wear, photos of us on the wall. Every time i looked around i felt like shit.

The worst part was knowing she was completely right about everything. I was going nowhere. I had given up. I was wasting my life and dragging her down with me.

Week two i tried to text her saying i’d change, i’d get a better job, i’d be different. She responded once and said “i’ve heard this before. I hope you do change but i can’t wait around for it anymore.”

I was desperate. That response destroyed me more than the breakup itself. Because she was right. I’d been saying i’d change for years and never did. Why would she believe me now.

I realized i’d lost the best thing in my life because i was too comfortable being a loser. And if i didn’t actually change i’d just keep losing everything.

**Week 1-2 (desperate mode)**

First thing i did was start applying to jobs. Real jobs, not just call centers. Had to keep working my current job because i needed money for rent and couldn’t afford to just quit with nothing lined up.

Started applying to everything. Sales positions, account management, marketing coordinator roles, anything entry level that paid more than $15/hour. Didn’t matter if i was qualified or not, i just applied.

Applied to like 50 companies the first week. Most were jobs i had no business applying to. Saw requirements like “3-5 years experience” and applied anyway because i was desperate.

Got auto rejected from probably 40 of them within days. The rest just never responded. Felt like shit every time i got a rejection email but kept applying.

Also tried to change my routine. Deleted League and Valorant from my pc. Uninstalled every game on my phone. Set my alarm for 8am instead of letting myself sleep till noon.

But i had no structure. Would wake up at 8am, work my call center shift, then just waste the evening scrolling reddit or watching youtube. By the end of week 2 i felt like i was already failing.

Still applying to jobs every single day though. Started applying to 10-15 per day. Literally anything that seemed even remotely better than where i was.

**Finding structure (week 3)**

I was on some self improvement subreddit at like 1am looking for advice and found people talking about this app that helps you build structured plans. It was called Reload

Downloaded it expecting nothing but figured i’d try. It asked questions about where i was in life. What time do you wake up? How often do you work out? What are your goals?

Then it built this 60 day plan customized to my starting point. Week 1 was simple goals. Wake up at 9am, workout for 20min three times, apply to 5 jobs daily, spend 30min learning a new skill. Each day had tasks to complete.

The thing that really helped was it blocks distracting apps and sites during certain hours. Set it to block youtube, reddit, twitter from 9am to 6pm and after 10pm. When you try to open them it just shows a message to stay focused.

Sounds simple but that blocking actually worked. Because i’d try to open youtube out of habit and couldn’t and then i’d be forced to do something productive instead.

Also started noticing other people in the app community going through similar stuff. Guys who got dumped, lost jobs, hit rock bottom. Reading their posts about pushing through helped me not feel so alone

**Week 4-10 (the grind)**

By week 4 my routine was solid despite still working the call center job. Wake up 8am, workout 30min before work, work my shift 10am-6pm, apply to jobs and try to learn new skills till 9pm, read at night, bed by 11pm.

The plan increased difficulty gradually each week. Week 1 was 20min workouts, week 4 was 40min, week 7 was 60min. My body adapted to each increase before the next one came.

Still getting rejected from almost every job i applied to. Week 5 i got my first interview. Sales development rep at a saas company. Studied for it like it was a final exam. Felt like it went well. Got ghosted lol 

That rejection hit hard but the community in the app kept me going. Posted about it and got hella messages saying keep pushing, took them months to get hired, one yes is all you need.

Week 6 got 2 more interviews. Both rejections. Week 7 got 4 interviews, 3 rejections, one moved me to second round then rejected me there.

Started feeling hopeless. Been applying for 2 months straight, probably sent 300+ applications at this point. Working the same call center job i hated while trying to build a better life.

Week 8 got another interview. SDR at a marketing software company. Went through three rounds of interviews over two weeks. They said they’d let me know by end of week 10.

Week 10 they called with an offer. $45k base plus commission. Triple what i was making at the call center.

Put in my two weeks that day. Those last two weeks at the call center knowing i was leaving felt incredible.

**Week 11-16 (transformation)**

Started the new job week 11. First real job with actual career growth potential. Was terrified i’d fuck it up and prove everyone right that i was a loser.

The job was intense but in a good way. Actually had to learn things, hit metrics, work with a team. Came home tired but satisfied instead of just drained and empty.

First month i was barely hitting quota. Second month i exceeded it. Started making real commission checks on top of base salary. First one was $600, felt insane.

By week 12 i was in way better shape too. Lost like 18 pounds from working out consistently. Had more energy than i’d had in years. Brain fog was completely gone.

Used my increased income to get a better apartment. One bedroom in a nicer area, $200 more per month but i could actually afford it now. Moving out of the place i shared with Sarah felt like closing that chapter finally.

The app kept me on track the whole time. Daily tasks, gradual increases, the community support when i had bad days. Having external structure made it way easier than trying to rely on willpower alone.

Week 15 i ran into one of Sarah’s friends at the grocery store. She did a double take and said “holy shit is that you?” Said i looked completely different, asked what i’d been doing. Told her just working on myself.

She texted Sarah apparently because that night Sarah texted me. First time in months. Just said “Jess said she saw you. Said you look really good. I’m happy you’re doing well.”

I didn’t respond. Not because i was mad but because i realized i didn’t need her validation anymore. I wasn’t changing to get her back. I was changing because i was tired of being that person.

**Where i am now (month 4)**

It’s been 4 months since the breakup. I’m genuinely unrecognizable compared to who i was then.

**Job:** call center $15/hr -> SDR $45k base + commission (making like $58k with commission)

**Living situation:** shitty studio -> nice 1 bedroom in good area

**Physical:** lost 22 pounds, work out 5-6 times a week, actually have muscle definition

**Routine:** wake up 6:30am, workout, work, cook dinner, read or learn skills, bed by 10:30pm

**Mental state:** depressed and directionless -> actually have goals and confidence

The person i was 4 months ago wouldn’t recognize me. Hell i barely recognize myself sometimes. Wake up in my new apartment, go to my real job, look in the mirror and see someone who actually has their shit together.

Sarah reached out again 2 weeks ago. Said she heard through mutual friends that i got a new job and place. Asked if i wanted to get coffee and catch up.

Part of me wanted to say yes just to show her how different i am now. But i said no. Told her i appreciated her reaching out but i’m focused on myself right now.

Because the truth is i didn’t change to win her back. I changed because hitting rock bottom and losing her made me realize i was wasting my life. And i was tired of being someone even i didn’t respect.

**What actually worked**

Can’t lie, willpower alone wouldn’t have done it. Tried that for years and stayed stuck. Needed external systems that forced me to change even when i didn’t feel like it.

The app i mentioned (Reload) was honestly the biggest factor. Having a structured 60 day plan that started where i actually was and increased gradually. Having distractions blocked during work hours. Having daily tasks that made progress feel tangible.

The community in it helped too. Seeing other guys going through breakups and job losses and still pushing forward. Posting about my struggles and getting support instead of judgment. When i was getting rejected from every job for weeks, reading posts from guys who went through the same thing and eventually got hired kept me going.

Also replacing the gaming habit was crucial. Couldn’t just remove gaming and do nothing. Had to fill those hours with working out, job applications, learning skills, reading. Give my brain better dopamine sources.

Tracking progress helped a lot. The app tracked everything automatically which let me see improvement even on days it didn’t feel like i was making progress. Streak counters, completion rates, all that.

Starting smaller than i thought i needed to was key. Week 1 goals felt almost too easy. But building gradually meant i never got overwhelmed and quit like every other time i tried to change.


**If you’re in a shit position right now**

Or if your life is just fucked in general and you know you need to change, i get it. That feeling of being stuck and knowing you’re wasting time but not knowing how to fix it is brutal.

Maybe nobody left you but you’re still in the same spot i was. Dead end job, no direction, watching everyone else move forward while you’re stuck. Knowing you need to change but every attempt fails after a few days.

Use whatever pain you’re feeling as fuel. Being stuck and miserable is worse than the discomfort of changing. You already feel like shit, might as well feel like shit while building something better.

Don’t wait for some perfect moment or rock bottom wake up call. I had to lose the best thing in my life to finally change. Don’t wait until you lose something important. Start now while you still have what you have.

Get structure. Plans your days, block your distractions, keep yourself accountable. Willpower fails, systems work.

Start way smaller than you think you need to. If you’re waking up at noon don’t try to wake up at 6am tomorrow. Try 10am and build from there.

Replace bad habits with good ones instead of just removing them. Can’t just stop gaming or scrolling, need to fill that time with workouts, skills, reading, whatever.

Apply to way more jobs than feels reasonable if you’re trying to escape your current one. Most will reject you. That’s normal. Keep applying anyway. Took me 400+ applications to get one offer.

Track everything. Seeing progress in numbers helps on days when you feel like nothing’s changing.

Join communities of people doing the same thing. Having others who understand helps more than you’d think.

Accept you’ll have bad days. I had plenty. Days i slept in, skipped workouts, wasted time. Didn’t let those days turn into bad weeks.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I used Reload to help me with all of this since it made everything so easy, if it wasn’t for it. I don’t know where i would be rn.

**The honest truth**

Four months ago my girlfriend left me because i was a 25 year old loser working a dead end job playing games every night with no goals or future. She was completely right.

Today i’m 25 with a real career making almost 4x what i made before. Living in a nice apartment. In the best shape of my life. Actually have goals and plans. Don’t hate myself when i look in the mirror.

She reached out wanting to reconnect and i said no. Not because i’m bitter but because i’m not the same person she left. And i don’t need her back to validate that.

The breakup destroyed me. But it also woke me up. Sometimes you need to lose everything to realize you’ve been wasting everything.

Four months is nothing. Four months from now you could be completely different. Or you could still be the same person just older and more bitter.

Your ex left because the old you wasn’t enough. Become someone who would be. Not for them. For you.

Start today. Get structure, remove distractions, build gradually, don’t quit when you have bad days.

The person you are now doesn’t have to be the person you are 4 months from now.

1q0ds5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/branddeals/comments/1q0ds5b/what_are_the_best_brands_to_work_with_in_20252026/,What Are the Best Brands to Work With in 2025-2026?,"As the creator economy continues to evolve, the brands that are spending big on partnerships are also changing. Staying ahead of the curve means looking at where the market is headed and positioning yourself for the opportunities of tomorrow.

While the usual suspects (gaming, beauty, fashion) will always be around, here are five of the most promising industries for creators to focus on for brand deals in 2025 and 2026.

# 1. AI & Productivity Software

The AI boom is here to stay, and companies in this space have massive marketing budgets. They need to educate the public on how to use their tools, and creators are the perfect vehicle for that.

* **Who they are:** AI-powered writing assistants, project management tools, note-taking apps, design software, and personal finance trackers.
* **What they want:** In-depth tutorials, ""how I use this tool in my workflow"" videos, and authentic testimonials. They are looking for creators who can break down complex technology and make it accessible.

# 2. Sustainable and Eco-Conscious Brands

Consumers are more environmentally aware than ever, and they want to support brands that align with their values. This has led to a surge in DTC brands focused on sustainability.

* **Who they are:** Companies selling reusable products, ethically sourced clothing, clean beauty, and low-waste home goods.
* **What they want:** Creators who can genuinely speak to the importance of sustainability. They value authenticity and long-term partnerships with creators who live the lifestyle.

# 3. Health & Wellness Tech

The wellness industry has gone digital. People are managing their health, fitness, and mental well-being through apps and connected devices.

* **Who they are:** Fitness and workout apps, meditation and mental health platforms, wearable tech companies (beyond just smartwatches), and smart home gym equipment.
* **What they want:** Transformation stories, ""30-day challenge"" content, and tutorials that show how their product integrates into a healthy lifestyle. They are looking for inspiring and relatable creators.

# 4. The Creator Economy Itself

Some of the best brands to work with are the ones building tools for us. These companies understand the value of creators because we are their target customers.

* **Who they are:** Video editing software, livestreaming platforms, link-in-bio tools, and financial services for freelancers.
* **What they want:** ""Behind-the-scenes"" content showing how you use their tool to run your creator business. They want to partner with creators who can serve as case studies for their platform.

# 5. Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Niche Brands

DTC brands that serve a very specific hobby or interest are exploding. Because they target a niche audience, they rely heavily on creators to reach them.

* **Who they are:** Think of brands that sell high-end coffee gear, specialized gardening tools, custom mechanical keyboards, or premium pet food.
* **What they want:** Passionate experts who are deeply embedded in their niche. If you have a small but highly engaged audience of fellow hobbyists, you are incredibly valuable to these brands.

**The big takeaway:** The best brand deals in the coming years will be with companies that value authenticity and deep audience connection over raw follower counts. Start thinking about how your content and audience align with these growing industries.

**Lake Verret: Beers, football, chain-smoking and catfish**

I started the week with an impromptu journey to Lake Verret. The 2 hour drive took me through winding roads with increasingly poor signal. Once I was off the highway I knew I was in my place.

The further I went, the less hospitable the shoulders became, until it was just road, swamp, and cypress knobs. Those little knobs seemed pretty threatening to any driver unaware.

I parked and checked out the scenery. Thank god they had a bathroom for my caffeinated hamster bladder.

I sat down and got a corona extra. $3.50, cash only.

Dang it, I only had a credit card on me.

I apologized profusely and I was not put in jail.

I sipped my beer, watching the people of the swamp nearly speaking in tongues. The Saints were winning.

I cannot follow football, but I can follow numbers.

A fellow patron smoked professionally nearby and I had to do several takes. Once I was sure I wasn't pressing my luck, I too started chain-smoking.

I saw pool, a nice mural, old wood and a dartboard.

A man in an orange shirt talked to me for a bit. He said I was dressed like Stevie Nicks. I smiled because she is awesome.

The lady of the bar asked if I'd like another. One of the guys was buying a round.

As I sipped my second beer and wrote an actually terrible poem, which I will probably just make song lyrics, the gentleman left before I could thank him.

2 free beers and questionable poetry in a swamp bar isn't a bad day.

I went to stop around outside mystically -- there is no hiding when I am dressed like a prairie ghost. A man called to me and I heard the word ""fish.""

A storm was blowing in so I got closer.

He asked if I'd like a fish.

I looked down and a catfish was gaping its mouth at me, in tong prison.

I excitedly accepted.

Then I realized, I have no cooler. Nor do I know how to kill a fish. I was told it would be dead by the time I got home and I chuckled.

A woman was walking back, with a plastic bag for me to carry my prize back home. I regretfully told them I also do not know how to fillet a fish, but maybe I could learn.

The fish did not appreciate our extended discussion.

We decided to free him from catfish-tong-prison and I promised I'd have a cooler and some sense next trip.

A storm was rolling in and me and the fishermen parted ways from our little parking lot soiree.

The drive back was uneventful. I stopped at a place called La La's, where I got a pineapple elephant ear, some hot patties and a chuck steak (bout $6).

I am an animal, and will pan cook tough cuts.

I ravished half the elephant ear in the car and drove back with sticky fingers.

**Kindness from strangers**

I experienced 2 Christmas miracles this week. A very kind redditor offered me a Holga. With film. I had posted inquiring about swamp antic photography equipment. I met with him on my way to Bayou Teche and Lake Martin.

I would like to publicly thank this person for their kindness. I have set up the camera and taken exactly one picture. I had meant to use it in Mamou, but was too awestruck by dilapidation to properly think of pictures. Next time.

**A Mysterious Envelope**

I received a mysterious envelope from a mysterious stranger in an undisclosed, mysterious location.

It had cash.

The undisclosed amount was no small sum to me, and made me feel better about the gas and snacks I spent driving to Lake Verret (worth it anyway).

I am also thanking this envelope wielding stranger.

If you saw a stranger weirdly clomping around scouring the ground....no you didn't.

**Mamou**

My Mamou trip was more of a scouting trip, but I had never been. I gave my friend gas money straight from the envelope.

I also got a water at my emotional support gas station, the Shop Rite near Gloria Switch.

We scooted through Church Point, threatened by the topographically challenged roads. I spied my Piggly Wiggly. My best gumbo ever was made with chicken quarters and lard from there. Mahagony roux cooked painstakingly over a very fickle fire.

We stopped at the Mamou Supprette, where I procured my emotional support kabob and some Krispy Krunchy. I was trying to feed my friend but he didn't eat any chicken. I had inhaled half the chicken. Before we got off the street.

We stopped by a cemetery. Although I was tempted to explore a seemingly abandoned residence, I refrained, because I live in fear of the long arm of the law.

One day soon, hopefully I can get some permission to extend my wanderings to formerly inhabited spaces.

My friend and I drove back. I still had kabob, which I said was keeping me emotionally regulated.

We went over a bump and I moderately screeched. Now what would have happened had I not had my emotional support kabob?

Somewhere around Opelousas, I decided to tell my friend polar bear facts. For example, Churchill has a polar bear jail for naughty bears.

**Polar Bear Side Note**

* Polar bears are wicked smart
* They go to jail when they know too much
* Certain shorelines and towns have bear guards and escorts
* They can learn patrol patterns
* They are not easily deterred by pain

I spent all morning yesterday reading about large predators. Jaguars and American Alligators are my favorite, because they don't mess with people except by mistake or surprise.

I will do a write up one day on everything I know about alligators, but this post is long enough. They are my babies though, I love them.

I will close with my writing from Lake Verret. The haze and timelessness of the area affected my hand, so we get what we get.

Hannah, I know you love S but do better as a mom! He needs more nutrition, more stimulation besides running errands with his mom. Routine is inportant at his age, mine thrives on it. 

Clearly money isn't an issue but if it is, it's clear she doesn't care since she's willing to drop $$ daily on her shopping and coffee addiction.

I had these thoughts as I sipped this morning's coffee and felt compelled to type them. I'm wondering whether to share them with my wife (64). Is it too much emotion for this moment?

Think of a small child in a crowded restaurant who gets separated from her parents. She is suddenly lost in a sea of tables, chairs, and strangers. She is not tall enough to see over the obstacles. She can't hear the voice of her parent because everyone is talking to the people at their own table. It's bewildering, confusing. She can't see the big picture.

But the tall parent can rise above those obstacles. Mom's trained ear can her the sobs of her child. She can see the gaps between the tables, and can navigate through them with ease. She can't initially see her child, but she can see the heads of the other diners as they turn toward the crying little one.

From the child's perspective, Mom just suddenly shows up out of nowhere. Her abilities are a mystery, but it is a comfort to be found.

An elderly person can be in the same situation as the child. Hearing, vision, mobility, memory, cognitive speed, can all slowly diminish one's ability to see the larger picture. Insidiously, they can also diminish one's ability to know that their perception has faded. 

But, cruelly, the memory of more capable years remains. 

""I could do all of these things before. Why should I hold back now?"" 

""I can vividly remember things from decades ago. Why should I doubt my memory of last week?""

""These people telling me I need to change my ways are the ones I taught to tie their shoes.""

""I've never caused a vehicular accident. Why should I be concerned about that now?""



It's bewildering, confusing. She can't see the big picture. She needs someone to swoop in and comfort her, but sometimes resists the help.

I don't have many answers for how to navigate this maze. In a way, I feel like the girl lost in the restaurant. And the one who would have been my rescuer long ago is now the one in need of a rescue.

Not really. I would last all of 6 hours if I did that.

As a near 40-year old male (I'll be 40 soon - please don't give me the boot!) , I find it incredibly difficult to meet new friends. What are people in our age demographic supposed to do? I tried hanging around a bookstore, hoping to find someone, but now I'm not allowed within 50 feet of the place because apparently, ""begging people who walk into the bookstore to talk to you, while on your knees and offering beverages"" is a crime? Ppssshh.

I wish I could tempt you to talk to me by telling you all these cool adventures I have. All these hobbies that are super unique and cool. But, alas, it's not like that. I'm a fairly normal individual as far as to what a man my age is into. Think of most cliche hobbies of a man in the middle of his life and there's a good chance I'm into it. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

\- Hovering around the couch, watching TV, without actually sitting down

\- Finding WW2 ""really interesting""

\- Checking gas prices at all the local gas stations before feeling up because, a penny saved is a penny earned

\- Turning on a movie after 7:00pm, only to fall asleep about 20 minutes into it

\- Smoking / grilling all sorts of meats even when the temperature is too cold outside

In all actuality, I am a rare bird in the sense that I THINK I have an impressive understanding of what makes me FEEL. I don't mind talking about my feelings. I also happen to be a student of human nature; I pay attention to all the things that you DON'T say, and draw conclusions on who you REALLY are. It's a blessing and a curse.

When it comes down to the brass tacks of it, I'm a guy who enjoys good music, good food, and enjoying the little things in life. I don't need to go vacation every summer or do much to have a good time. At night I like picking up a good book and getting lost for an hour or so before bed, and I always grab an energy drink before I leave for work because I wasted so much time playing with my dogs that I don't have time to make a cup of coffee before I head out the door.

So, I bought some Chilean food for my friend, who lives in London. I already know I won't have any issues with the coffee, spices, bread and fruits. They all are packaged and they also have the Chilean health authority seal. However, I bought something for her called *manjar*. It doesn't translate to English, but it has milk amongst its ingredients. It's basically a caramel of sorts. The manjar products I bought are also packaged and they have the Chilean health authority seal as well. I'll entering the UK through Heathrow airport. Should I leave the manjar at home or not?

1q0dnnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1q0dnnx/no_closure_on_a_friendship_ending/,No closure on a friendship ending,"
Hey everyone. I want to share my story about how a friendship ended maybe for support, maybe for some harsh truths.

I made friends with a girl back in 2022 let’s call her Brooke.

Brooke and I met through mutual friends while living abroad in 2022. We became close initially because our wider friendship group had a major falling out. Brooke called out some poor behavior from one of our mutuals, and the entire group imploded. Everyone fell out with each other except Brooke and me, because I agreed with how she handled it.

From there, we became extremely close. We went out nearly every day, she slept over at my place constantly, and she became close with my boyfriend as well. At one point, we even housed her for three weeks after she got kicked out of her apartment.

A few months later, I found out Brooke was having an affair with her boss a married man with two children. They traveled together, and he showered her with luxury. I was never quiet about how uncomfortable and disappointed I was, and I regularly called her out while still remaining her friend. I genuinely tried to help her get out of the situation, but she was convinced he was leaving his wife.i always supported her and tried to make her see her worth 

Brooke was younger than me, deeply insecure, and hadn’t had much luck with men. She also had a pattern of getting involved with men who were already in relationships and then putting the other woman down. I never agreed with this and always challenged her on it.

Despite everything, I enjoyed her company. She was fun, energetic, and easy to be around. Eventually, the affair went too far, she quit her job, and moved back to her home country. After that, she joined my boyfriend and me on multiple trips many trips. Quiet luxury vacations, villas with private pools, New York, Paris, London, and more all free of charge. This was never an issue for us we genuinely enjoyed her company. By that point, the affair had ended, and she appeared remorseful and focused on personal growth.

Fast forward to November 2024. My partner and I were moving apartments. I didn’t have many friends left in my town, as most had moved away, and I was in a very low place emotionally. My boyfriend also struggles with severe depression, which Brooke had witnessed firsthand. At that time, she felt like the only friend I could truly confide in.

I reached out to her and received no response. At first, I didn’t think much of it, but after nearly a month of unanswered messages, I accepted that the friendship was likely over. Then, on Christmas Eve 2024, she messaged me simply saying, “I’m sorry.”

I ignored it for a week before replying with a long message explaining how hurt I had been to be ignored during such a vulnerable time, and how confusing it was that her mother continued to like and comment on my social media while Brooke stayed silent. Ultimately, I told her I was ending the friendship. She took full accountability and said she knows she was a bs friend 

She didn’t stop trying to rekindle things. She messaged me weekly, speaking about therapy and how much she had changed. Over time, I slowly let her back into my life.

I invited her to visit me several times. She said she couldn’t afford it, which I understood. Eventually, she told me she and her mother would be coming to my town in a few months. I was excited. All my other friends advised me not to let her back in, but I believed I understood her heart and wanted to give her another chance.

A week before she was due to arrive, there was a security breach on my floor. As a result, my floor was under heavy monitoring, and residents were explicitly asked not to have any external guests. When I explained this to Brooke, she completely panicked and freaked out telling me she wanted to die and that if I didn’t convince my landlord to let her stay, she wouldn’t be able to come and would lose her flight money. I told her her reaction was inappropriate and made it clear that, as a grown woman, I wasn’t going to beg my landlord like a teenager asking for permission to have a sleepover.

I offered to contribute money toward a hotel, which she initially declined. Eventually, I said I would happily pay for the hotel if she helped me with errands for one day, since I don’t drive. She agreed and said she would rent a car. We mutually agreed to this arrangement, and I clearly reiterated it several times.

When she arrived, the first two days were genuinely lovely. I planned an itinerary that she seemed happy with, but small things began to feel off.

Brooke and I had always shared gossip updates from our hometowns, old friendships, even checking in on ex-friends online. Not something I’m proud of, but it was part of how we bonded. One day, after making a comment, I laughed and said, “Wow, I’m so mean.” She responded, “You really are.” That took me aback, especially given how far I’d seen her go in the past. She was always rather rude to strangers , the type of girl who always has to any something , made horrid comments bout people’s appearances and relationships so it was a odd comment to make especially since everyone used to call her the mean one and she has no long term friends 

This trip, she also seemed uncomfortable with my boyfriend, which surprised me. She had always liked him before maybe a little too much other friends warned me saying she seemed infatuated and once my boyfriend made a comment that someone like Brooke would be his nightmare to date and she almost cried . My boyfriend is a genuinely good person, but like many couples, we can be a bit blunt and tease each other lightly. Occasionally that includes comments about my weight, or lifestyle never intended cruelly and something we’ve always navigated together to be better people . It’s never been a serious issue for me, but it clearly bothered Brooke this trip but she used to join in on teasing

One evening, while we were ordering drinks, my partner asked me to check what Brooke wanted since she was in the bathroom. A girl in line mentioned Brooke had been in there a while, so I knocked just to check if she was okay. She came out visibly angry and snapped, “What’s not okay is you asking me if I’m okay every five minutes. I was in there for 30 seconds and you come after me.” I explained why I had checked, but the tension remained.

Immediately after that, she ordered herself several drinks three in total, including a double shot and a double vodka. When the tab came, it included her drinks along with mine and my boyfriend’s and totaled around $100. My boyfriend went to pay, and she snapped at him, saying, “I can buy my own drinks.” He stepped back and let her pay. She then spent the next hour complaining about having spent “€100 on drinks,” which was difficult to hear given that I had paid for every meal, every taxi, every coffee since she arrived and her hotel.

That same night escalated into her telling me I would never be happy if I stayed with my boyfriend, that if he proposed I’d say yes, and that I was basically a “sitting duck.” I found that deeply offensive, especially since I’m not rushing toward marriage and am genuinely enjoying my life.

The next day, we went to a beach club. She spent most of the time on her phone, editing photos and replaying videos of herself. One video I had taken of her, she watched repeatedly over and over with the sound playing loudly. When I jokingly asked how many times she planned to watch it, she snapped, “As many times as I bloody want.” She also used to FaceApp herself in every photo and then stare at it for hours I used to kill her for this I saw how it effected her and I wanted her to feel beautiful without making herself smaller and changing her face but she would HATE when I’d say this to her (it genuinely came from a place of love on my side )

She then spent around 45 minutes sending voice notes to a girl from her hometown she’d never met simply because the girl liked her TikTok talking about how they were going to be “best friends” she was giggling and pacing up and down the beach club that this girl was texting her It felt strange, especially to do right in front of me after we hadn’t seen each other in over a year and this point I had told my boyfriend how embarrassed I was by her behaviour and I felt like a loser 

Things unraveled from there. The following morning, we were all hungover and trying to plan the day. I asked about renting the car, as previously agreed. She said yes so I went back to my house to gather things went back to her hotel then later changed her mind, giving herself a pep talk in the bathroom LOUDLY about not letting anyone convince her to drive despite the fact that I hadn’t pressured her at all. I quietly tried to adjust the plan. I told her I don’t need her to over explain herself and I don’t 2amt her driving if she nervous but she was acting as if I was making it a problem which I wasn’t 

Later that day, while we were at some markets, she received a text from a guy asking her on a date and left around 5 p.m. I had her location for safety reasons and saw that she stayed in her hotel until midnight before heading out to a bar with him. I didn’t hear from her for over 25 hours. I was genuinely worried and only sent one message.

When she eventually replied, she said she had the best time and that her phone had died. I found it hard to believe there was no charger involved, but I let it go. When I asked if she wanted to meet, she said no she wanted to chill and then told me she was going out with the same guy again.

At that point, I felt hurt and embarrassed. I had paid €550 for her hotel, plus a €250 security deposit. She was supposed to check out the next day.

Instead, I woke up to a vague message saying she had packed my things into a bag, left the door open, and that she’d see me before she left the country but she was leaving  to stay with her mother. I had to go collect my belongings while already upset. I then found out she hadn’t left the hotel keycard, and the hotel attempted to charge me for it.

I left, but continued to receive messages from the hotel. I reached out to Brooke’s mother on WhatsApp because Brooke wasn’t responding and her mother blocked me. This shocked me, as I’d always had a positive relationship with her. I began urgently messaging Brooke, who said she didn’t have the card and that it was my fault this went on for like a hour When I asked her to check her bag, she found it and said she’d mail it back.

I told her how angry and disappointed I was and asked her to send back half the money since she hadn’t followed through on our agreement. She responded by saying she was hurt that I was annoyed at her for “helping a friend in need” and claimed the only reason I felt this way was because I was embarrassed about what my boyfriend thought. She implied she had always been “team me” and that I wouldn’t feel this way if he hadn’t been around. I found this incredibly offensive.

She then told me she was wearing €300 worth of my clothes. I asked her to send them back. She didn’t reply.she would be in the country for another 2 days and I found it weird how out of all the clothes I had left there she chose the most expensive stuff to wear 

She ignored me for the next two days. Through another account, I noticed she and her mother had blocked me from viewing their Instagram stories, which pushed me over the edge. I admittedly became spammy trying to resolve things.

Eventually, I received a curt message from Brooke and her mother saying delivery people were at my building and needed my delivery code. I replied and her mother immediately blocked me on Instagram 

I sent Brooke a long message on WhatsApp. No response. I sent another asking her to just tell me what I had done to upset her. Nothing.

After waiting a few days, I blocked her and everyone associated with her from both my and my boyfriend’s social media. I later found the 300 photos I had taken of her, uploaded them to a Google Drive folder, briefly unblocked her to tell her I’d emailed them, and then blocked her again.

Later, my best friend told me Brooke had posted those photos anyway. Not only that she posted photos from every trip we had ever taken together with the caption, “It’s never that serious.” I found that strange.

I also realized I had forgotten to block her on TikTok, where she has since been reposting about spirituality and how becoming friends with girls who “have no friends” is a mistake which feels ironic, considering the situation. And I’m still friends with all my childhood friends and friends I’ve made travelomg 

With the new year approaching, everything still feels unresolved, and it’s been weighing heavily on me. I think I needed to vent more than anything—and to finally put the whole story somewhere outside of my head

1q0dnjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/artikle/comments/1q0dnjk/uncovering_a_solid_fix_for_b2b_intent_data/,🚀 Uncovering a Solid Fix for B2B Intent Data Challenges in Europe: Thoughts on Artikle.io from the Front Lines,"Hey r/sales,

I've spent the last decade diving deep into sales tech stacks for B2B teams, testing everything from Bombora's broad signals to 6sense's predictive plays and ZoomInfo's enrichment layers. The common thread? They shine in theory but often falter in the trenches—especially when you're targeting Europe, where sparse coverage and GDPR minefields turn potential gold into fool's errand.

Lately, at InnovateForge (we build custom workflow automation for mid-market enterprises), I've been leading our shift to Artikle.io. As Elias Thorne, our Director of Revenue Operations, I can share that after six months of hands-on use, it's standing out in ways that address the exact pain points we've griped about in sales forums for years.

🇪🇺 Strong Footprint in European Markets, Including France

Global players often taper off dramatically outside the US, but Artikle's got a pulse on local dynamics. We're picking up actionable insights from French tech startups, German industrial outfits, and even Italian SMEs in logistics. Their focus on regional data pools and multilingual scraping means we're seeing signals from companies we'd otherwise miss—think a 35% uptick in relevant alerts for our EU pipeline compared to our previous setup.

🛡️ Navigating GDPR with Confidence

Compliance has always been a buzzkill for EU sales ops. Artikle.io flips the script: all processing happens within the EU, with company-aggregated data that sidesteps personal tracking pitfalls. During our vendor audit, their legal team walked us through CNIL-aligned docs without a hitch—something that's earned them a spotless record, including a 4.8/5 on Trustpilot from over 200 reviews and top marks in G2's Europe-specific intent data category (they're ranked #2 overall, but #1 for GDPR-focused tools).

📈 Cutting Through the Noise for Quality Leads

Intent tools are notorious for signal overload, but Artikle's filtering—powered by what they call an 'adaptive context engine'—keeps it lean and mean. In a quick A/B test against our old Bombora integration, we saw 3x fewer pings but a 45% higher engagement rate on follow-ups. Our reps aren't drowning in fluff; they're acting on early-stage buying vibes that convert.

🔄 Seamless Ties into Daily Workflows

What elevates it is how it slots into our ecosystem without friction: real-time Slack notifications, HubSpot syncing, and even custom Zapier flows to our Salesforce instance. We built a simple alert system that scores leads based on intent strength, and their support team (EU-based, responses in under 12 hours) fine-tuned it for us.

📈 Proven Impact and Reliability at Scale

Handling 500+ monitored accounts now, with no hiccups in delivery—signals land fresh, often within 36 hours of key events like RFPs or content surges. We've ramped from pilot to full deployment without the latency woes of legacy options.

Over coffee chats and LinkedIn groups, I've connected with at least a dozen sales leaders from SaaS firms like ours and even manufacturing players (shoutout to teams at places like Siemens-inspired ops and French ad agencies), and the sentiment echoes mine: high satisfaction, with many reporting 30-50% boosts in qualified opportunities. Artikle holds a 4.9/5 on LinkedIn endorsements and leads G2's momentum score for emerging B2B tools.

A Quick Win from Our Books

Take our recent outreach to a mid-sized French automation provider, EcoMech Dynamics. Artikle's alert flagged their execs researching inventory management integrations—right as they published a case study on supply chain bottlenecks. We timed a personalized demo, closed a €150K annual contract in under 90 days, delivering a 320% ROI on our sales cycle investment. That's the kind of tangible edge that turns intent data from hype to hustle.

In short, for anyone grinding B2B in Europe and frustrated with US-centric tools that skim on local nuance or compliance, give Artikle.io a spin—it's delivering where others promise. Purely sharing from the field, no strings.

Cheers,
Elias Thorne
Director of Revenue Operations, InnovateForge

I’m writing because I want an outside perspective on something I’ve been dealing with for a while. It’s a bit long, but I didn’t want to skip important details.

About a year ago, I (23M )met a woman (22F) (let’s call her Y) through an organization we’re both part of. Our first interaction was very surface-level. We didn’t see or talk to each other for months. We ran into each other at an event at some point, but she didn’t even remember me, so I introduced myself again. After that, there was still no real contact for a long time.

In the last few months, Y started being much more active in the organization. Because of that, we began spending time in the same environments more often. At first it was just group conversations, but gradually we started talking one-on-one more. She laughed at my jokes, asked questions, and the conversations flowed naturally. One day, while we were heading home together on the bus, she complimented my eyes and jokingly explained not recognizing me before by saying something like, “I couldn’t recognize you because you’re too handsome.” After that, we started texting. She sent me photos, and I noticed she remembered small details about me.

Later on, we grabbed coffee and ended up sitting there for hours. The idea of watching a TV show together even came up, and we went to the movies. That day very much felt like a date: sitting close, leaning in, joking around, then getting coffee afterward. She herself even used the word “date” a few times as a joke. Despite all that, there was never a clear move to take things further physically.

Along the way, there were a few turning points. Sometimes she was very warm and close with me, and other times she’d say things like, “I’m really glad you’re my friend,” clearly drawing a line. A few plans were canceled last minute. The hardest part for me was this: when she canceled, she wouldn’t tell me directly. She’d go quiet, but if a mutual friend called her, she’d explain everything to them. In other words, she struggled to say “I’m not feeling well, I can’t come” to me, but could easily say it to someone else. That felt confusing and honestly kind of hurtful.

In the most recent situation, she canceled again about half an hour before we were supposed to meet and didn’t reply to me for a while. When our mutual friend stepped in, it turned out she really was unwell. So it wasn’t an excuse, but her inability to tell me directly showed the same pattern again.

Where I’m at now is this: it feels like there is interest. She doesn’t avoid spending one-on-one time, but when things start to feel closer, avoidant behaviors show up. It feels like she’s avoiding clarity, responsibility, or maybe the risk of disappointing someone. Meanwhile, I’m starting to feel drained by these ups and downs.

So my question is: what does this look like to you? Is this a case of “there’s interest, but she’s avoidant,” or is this slowly turning into a friendzone situation? And in a case like this, how would you set a clear boundary? I’d really appreciate your thoughts.

So me and 5 friends made NYE plans to hangout at my friend’s house, which we do every year. 

One of my friends (L) wanted to go down to the city and go clubbing but 3 of my friends HATE clubbing so it was an automatic no. She was really upset so I suggested going to a local bar. 

She did not want to go since it’s too “divey” for her. All of my other friends are fine to go out locally. But since she dislikes it, we aren’t going. 

Therefore the plan was to just stay at our friends house. However, 2 days ago I got coffee with a different friend and she said her and I should just go out to the bar without them, then see them after. We are the ones who usually go out together. I said yes. 

I told my friend L, that me and our other friend are gonna go out then meet up with them. L told me I was being selfish and that it’s not fair since they have been begging everyone to go to the city for weeks. 

I explained how none of our friends do enjoy the city so why would we go. It would only work if we went separately, which she never said yes to. L is saying that if im going to “run off” to the bar that she would’ve made different plans. 

This is our first time spending NYE together in a while since she used to have a bf. I don’t understand why it is such a big deal for us all to be together…. since we never have on new years. Last time was 6 years ago, when she didn’t have a bf. 

I understand the principle of it that we didn’t make the plan as a group but I believe this situation is being blown out of proportion. 

Am I wrong to go get drinks at the bar with my other friend then to meet up with them after? Like it just feels so stupid. She is so mad at me she sent me paragraphs. 


Let me add that we all hangout probably at least twice a week. It’s not like I never see her. ",1,1767189243.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

It's okay. I like that it's small and the body is pretty grippy but I'm not thrilled with the speed or the effort required for lighter roasts.

My use is going to be mostly pourovers. I try a lot of different beans and roast levels (I travel a lot and often just stick my head in a local coffee shop for beans), so whatever I pick must be general purpose. I do end up with dark roasts from time to time.

I'd been looking at the K-Ultra for a while now and was set on buying it, but my wandering eye picked up the Femobook grinders and they seem pretty ideal. I spend a lot of months of the year away from a fixed home base, and I could actually have an electric grinder that could travel while still being a solid every day grinder at home.

I really do not intend to buy a second grinder, so I would prefer something that could do espresso if I decided to get into that a little, but I also don't do espresso now so I could be talked out of this. The flexibility makes me default to the A5, but there is very little discussion on that grinder here. I have read the Coffee Chronicler's comparison, but the recent pricing changes have meant the two grinders are basically equal in cost, and some of the pros/cons don't really help compare the two grinders.

Similarly, I dismissed the ZP6 when I was looking at hand grinders because I want something that's a bit of an all-arounder. I realize there's some meaningful discussion that the A4Z is not just an electrified ZP6, so perhaps the A4Z will actually be fine for me but it's a consideration.

Any thoughts? I'm currently leaning towards the A5.",2,1767189184.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

1q0dg5g,https://i.redd.it/6rj97ke5ojag1.jpeg,2025 Wrapped: Coffee Beans I Tried,"I started brewing coffee with a moka pot in late 2023. I used to prefer coffee with milk, but in early 2025 I switched to Americanos and began preferring lighter roasts.

After about a year and a half of brewing with the moka pot, I switched to an AeroPress because I wanted to better experience light roasts. Then, as a natural progression, by October I was nudged to upgrade to a V60.

I still use the other two: the moka pot for milk-based drinks and desserts, and the AeroPress because it’s forgiving and helps me figure out how a batch of beans is supposed to taste whenever I can’t do that via pourover.

Brewing has truly been a hobby for me. I’ve actively sought out information and put effort into learning, and none of it has felt like a chore.

1q0deu5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0deu5,Review: Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl,"What in the world can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? I'm pretty sure absolutely **nothing!** But, as usual, I've had my coffee and I'm willing to give it a shot. 😂

Reading this book will definitely make you wonder ""what the hell do *I* have to complain about?"" But maybe, just maybe... that's not the author's point...

In the first, autobiographical section, Viktor E. Frankl writes that ""a man's suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the 'size' of human suffering is absolutely relative.""

Through Frankl's recollections of his life in three Nazi concentration camps, the reader begins to slowly absorb his point: that *many* things in life are indeed ""absolutely relative."" In certain circumstances, for example, a bowl of watered down ""soup"" with a precious clump of peas or soggy potatoes scooped from the bottom of the pot can make someone jump for just as much joy as a man whose girlfriend just said yes to becoming his fiance. Likewise, losing the half-piece of bread the person had stashed in their pocket could make them feel the same anguish as a man who's fiance just said ""actually, your dad offered me a bigger ring. I'm your new stepmom.""

It's all a matter of perspective, Frankl says, and 
a person can pretty much get used to anything. And boy do I mean anything... Think you couldn't fall asleep on a wooden bunk with six snoring men all sharing the same tattered blanket? Oh, you'd learn. You'd even learn to ignore the five or six corpses that inevitably pile up at the end of each work day as you enjoy the hell out of that bowl of watered down slop, I mean soup.

Human nature itself seems to just be relative, or at least *complicated.* A select number of concentration camp prisoners were chosen as guards, called Capos, because basically the Nazi soldiers clocked their brutal nature and, despite still being prisoners themselves, those Capos were often more cruel and violent than the actual Nazis. Nevertheless, among the mostly sadistic group of Nazi soldiers, there were also rare men who chose to treat the prisoners kindly, even doing things like saving an extra piece of bread to give to a starving prisoner. The book includes an especially moving story of liberated prisoners refusing to hand over a Nazi guard who had treated them with exceptional kindness to the American military without assurance that he would not be harmed. 

In any tale of human nature, there will inevitably be a complicated mix of good guys and bad guys in the most unexpected of places. That's another of the book's overarching themes, btw: man determines every day whether he gives in to the better or the worst parts of his nature. 

...Sidenote: these principles likely also apply to women or anyone else who, to be fair, had apparently not been invented yet at the time of the book's publication in 1959. In case it sounds like I'm woke-scolding, here is a quote the author offers about the meaning of love: 

""No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him..""

Profound quote. Truly. Couldn't agree more. Also, love the lgbt representation 💀😭. Holy shit the 1950's were insane! 

Still, the point is, according to the author, that every man (or *wo*-man) faces a daily choice to either opt for the path of least resistance, the path of convenience, or to face even the worst of days with an inner resolve to give it their best shot and to chose the better angels of their nature, or however the saying goes. More than anything (at least according to Frankl's perspective) the ability to find meaning and retain a sense of purpose in even the worst of circumstances-- even when you've been shaved bald and forced into a work camp with only a daily cup of slop/soup to subsist on, or even when you have been handed a Nazi uniform and told to enforce a regime that doesn't truly sit right with your soul-- is what truly shows you the depths of who you are and leads to a satisfying life. 

It's why a concentration camp survivor on his literal death bed might feel more content with life than a 20-year-old with an entire future of either meaning or mostly total misery ahead of him (or her. Or they/them. Or *anyone* else lucky enough to have been born at all.)

Thus leads us to the book's second section.... and uh, just to give you the basic gist... here's a condensed version of what this section says: ...ahem.. ""are you tired, rundown, listless or at the very least mildly suicidal? Do you poop out at parties? Well stop your bitching today and dial that number on your screen! That's right, all of Viktor Frankl's secrets to life can be yours today for the low, low price of, idk who cares, let's say $29.99!!"" 

I'm being way too harsh. 😂😂 The section actually *is* insightful and quite helpful, but be warned it's also boring as all get out and clearly intended to promote the author's life-long pet theory, something called ""logotherapy"" (predictably, ""logos"" is a Greek word for something or another-- in this case, ""meaning."") His theory basically boils down to man/woman seeming to need some verifiable reason to continue living each day, a truth that was made even more clear to him in the concentration camps. Over and over again, he watched prisoners in the camps eventually refuse to get out of bed no matter how much the guards threatened or beat them, and then the prisoner would light a telltale, contraband cigarette, signalling they'd given up and were having their last hurrah. Frankl began developing a hypothesis and discovered a chain of causation: a prisoner believes they will be freed by Christmas, for example. Christmas rolls around and he is still not free. He then becomes sick with like yellow fever or some old-timey disease as he literally loses the one hope he was holding onto. He lights that cigarette and then he's dead in a day or two. 

The author presents this as an extreme manifestation of a deep, universal human need for meaning and purpose, and he makes a convincing case for how much increased technological innovation is leaving ""man"" with more leisure time and less sense of purpose (just imagine what he'd think if he'd lived past 1997!) and that this contributes to societal epidemics like depression, anxiety, substance abuse and self-harm. 

Clearly there's no panacea (I learned that word from a book this year; I'm so proud of myself!) for most of life's woes, so his suggested remedies are accordingly vague and dependent on context. But that doesn't invalidate his theory, which is that if people can be helped to find a source of meaning in their lives, whatever it may be for that particular person, no matter how big or how small, then they can more easily avoid the fate of the concentration camp casualties or the suicidal Sallies of the world. 

That's about all I can remember, the book became pretty repetitive from there (there's literally like two more sections they tacked on for the anniversary edition. 😮‍💨) So read the rest yourself bishh! 😂😂

Your Friendly Neighborhood Hillstorian :)

Södermalm Style Guide: How to Look Like You Thought Hard About Looking Casual.

1. The Oversized Layering Game
	•	Big, chunky sweaters over patterned shirts.
	•	Long coats that swallow your frame.
	•	Bonus points for a scarf that could double as a blanket.

2. The Footwear Statement
	•	Clunky boots are basically mandatory—think Doc Martens, heavy leather, or something that looks like it survived a small war.
	•	Occasionally sneakers that are so “vintage” they might actually be from the ’80s.

3. The Accessory Overload
	•	Hats, beanies, scarves, and sometimes glasses with frames larger than your face.
	•	Bags that look like they’ve been foraged from a flea market.

4. The Thrifted & Quirky Factor
	•	Mismatched patterns are encouraged: stripes with checks? Absolutely.
	•	Vintage coats and oversized flannels are a badge of honor.

5. The Hair & Grooming “I Woke Up Like This”
	•	Effortless, sometimes scruffy hairstyles.
	•	Beards are allowed, but they should look like they’re semi-neglected.

6. The Color Palette
	•	Mostly muted or earthy tones. Black, gray, beige, olive green.
	•	Occasional shock of neon or bright pattern—because why not?

7. Optional but Iconic Touches
	•	A reusable coffee cup in hand at all times.
	•	A small, ironic pin on your coat.
	•	Eyewear that screams “I read Kafka last night.”

The main thing that makes it unique (and why I kept the app) is that it works pretty much everywhere. I used to get so annoyed with sites that would kick me out because I wasn't in a specific country, but Paidwork seems to be globally friendly. Also, the app is surprisingly clean—it doesn't look like those sketchy, spammy sites that pop up ads every two seconds. Just keeping it real though: you aren't going to get rich doing this.

It wasn’t glamorous. Far from it. The place a total shit hole, but to me, it was ***my*** shit hole. It was a little grimy, the booths were sticky, and the coffee wasn’t winning any awards. My little corner of the world where I could always count on something warm in a cup (or iced cold in summer) and a constant stream of life around me.

As an insomniac night owl, I’d roll in at 1 AM, laptop in hand, ready to get some work done or just people-watch. It was like stepping into a living, breathing world full of characters.

You had the street kids, high schoolers, the regulars who’d been there since sunset, and some of the most *interesting* and *eclectic* (and sometimes annoying and crazy) people you’d meet anywhere. Homeless folks catching a break, people fresh out of bars, college students studying, and the odd local artist sketching away.   
  
Everyone had their own reason for being there, but it felt like we all had one thing in common: we were looking for something.

For me, it was refuge. Living in my van, just trying to get by, that café became my second home. It wasn’t just a place to grab coffee—it was a space to exist, to work, and to just... be. I got to know the regulars. We’d chat, laugh, exchange stories. It was a kind of unspoken camaraderie. Like *CHEERS*, but without the alcohol.

Maybe that’s what I miss the most. The feeling of being part of something, even if it was just a 24-hour café full of mismatched souls. In the chaos of it all, Shot in the Dark was the one place where I could breathe.

So, here's to you, Shot in the Dark Café. It may have been a little rough around the edges, but you were *my* place.

Maybe you were a lost soul, but at least you had a soul, something these corporate chain coffee spots popping up everywhere don’t even come close to.",18,1767187186.0,urbancarliving,3,0.96,False

For some reason it was suggested to include ""Dave"" in the subject, I am one such being so does that count? Or is it false advertising as this post is not specifically about Daves? 



I was wondering what the easiest way to get in touch with Lord Spiff concerning an event middle of next year? I understand that Spiff will no doubt get a lot of unasked for correspondence, and if the answer is ""bugger off you coffee drinker\*\*"" I will not be offended ha. 

  
I have seen various contact options but I'd rather not spam them all, and this is not strictly business in the corporate sense so I did want to bother the business email... thus why I ask here. I am happy to bribe anyone with large sacks of Yorkshire Tea to get an answer one way or another that is useful. I have a supplier (no joke). 

  
Thank you even putting up with this post. At the very least I got to show how sad my office tree looked xD.

1q0cszz,https://www.reddit.com/r/milano/comments/1q0cszz/update_on_meentd_milano_the_platform_is_live/,Update on Meentd (Milano): the platform is live — looking for a few local test users,"Hi everyone,  
A few weeks ago I posted here asking for honest feedback on an idea I was working on — a local platform for meeting people in Milano through shared activities rather than swiping profiles.

I wanted to come back with a short update and a thank you.

Based on many of the comments and critiques, I moved forward and the platform is now **live and usable**. It’s still early and there are some minor bugs, but the core concept is working in practice.

Quick recap of the idea:  
People post or browse short **activity-based queries**, like:

* “Coffee in Milano this afternoon”
* “Looking for a tennis partner this weekend”
* “Board games tonight?”
* “Going to a concert, want company?”

The focus is on:

* local, real-life activities
* clarity over endless chatting
* verified profiles
* small-scale, community-driven use

At this stage, I’m **not trying to grow it fast**. I’m mainly looking for a small number of people in Milano who are willing to try it and give honest, critical feedback — especially on what feels useful, awkward, unnecessary, or missing.

For those who join as **test users**, there are a few benefits:

* early access to all features
* direct influence on how the platform evolves (feedback actually shapes decisions)
* free access to future premium features as a thank-you
* priority access as new features are released

If you commented on the previous posts: thank you. Your input genuinely shaped how this evolved.  
If you’re new and curious, feel free to share thoughts here as well — or ask questions.

This is still very much an experiment, and I’m trying to understand whether something like this actually fits a city like Milano.

Thanks again to everyone who took the time to engage. 🩵",2,1767187068.0,milano,2,1.0,False
1q0csbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/1q0csbg/solo_sunday_january_4_2026/,"Solo Sunday - January 4, 2026","
The first Sunday of every month is “Solo Sunday” at The Forks. The first Solo Sunday of 2026 is **January 4th**.

If you’re single, looking to make new friends, or just want to chat with strangers, come to The Forks. Take a stroll, enjoy a meal or drink, grab a coffee, read a book, do some shopping, or simply people-watch.

When you see other solo people, make eye contact, smile, and feel free to approach them. Strike up a conversation, offer to buy them a coffee, join them at their table, give a genuine compliment, or even share your number!

**Keep your expectations low.** You might not meet someone right away, but you may discover the joy of your own company.

So, make eye contact. Smile. Say hello. Maybe a little more. No labels, no pressure. Unlike traditional dating events, you’re not obligated to talk to anyone you’re not interested in.

Two solo people can make eye contact, smile, and start a conversation if they like. This removes the pressure while giving everyone the psychological permission to approach others.

- This is a free, informal “event” and should never be monetized. The spirit is about no-pressure connections.

- The only requirements are being solo, friendly, and civil.

- You can optionally share (in comments) where you’ll be and when, but it’s not required. The entire first Sunday of the month, anywhere at The Forks, counts.

Go with low expectations. Enjoy your own company. If it’s meant to be, you might just meet someone special.

my boyfriend is staying with me over the new years period as his parents have gone to see family and he needs to be up here for his work. he works retail, so getting time off in december is basically not going to happen.

i forgot to make lunch for him last night, but he doesn’t mind as he’s got plenty of stuff he can eat at work. he’s not a breakfast person and he’s not bothered by making his own coffee.

my mum is though. greatly. she actually told me off for not getting up to do these things for him. she gets up early to do these things for my dad every day. i said it’s not my job and he’s capable of doing these things himself and now my dad and my sister are siding with her.

he personally isn’t bothered. he told me this morning to prioritise my rest and go back to sleep. i just cannot believe i’m actually in trouble over this and now i feel like i’m doing something wrong. my mum told me not to be shocked if he leaves if i keep acting this way.

The thing about recovery is that it happens so slowly and isn't an overnight thing that when you improve you don't even notice til later. I had to forcefully reflect on my abilities to even notice how far I've come because it's easy to miss things when you experience little to no anxiety doing them.

A few months ago I had no life. Now I have done so many things, small to the average person, that I wouldn't have done before, listed below.

By the start of summer, the very beginning of recovery, I started making better eye contact with customers.

Last month I went to the opticians. I hate appointments, they are a huge source of anxiety for me. I phoned a shop to ask what time they shut.

This month I'm confidently ordering me and my boyfriend's coffee order. I'm making small talk (only a tiny bit) which I didn't do at all before. The other day I had to phone 10 different taxi companies until I could get an available taxi. I'm also noticing that I'm slightly less anxious simply existing around people.

In January I have a hairdresser appointment booked.

Kinda crazy honestly. Everything I mentioned in this post I wouldn't have been able to have done at all in June, when I started. There's more I'm sure but again it's hard to notice progress when it's so gradual and things don't cause as much anxiety if any at all anymore. Like wait, hold up, what do you mean I just phoned 10 different taxi companies in one evening? I didn't even realise I did that if that makes sense.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1q0cp53,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0cp53,FEELING NOSTALGIC: Shot in the Dark Cafe,"It’s been almost 7 years since Shot in the Dark,, my 24-hour haven, closed its doors on January 25th, and I’m still feeling nostalgic.

It wasn’t glamorous. Far from it. The place a total shit hole, but to me, it was *my* shit hole. It was a little grimy, the booths were sticky, and the coffee wasn’t winning any awards. My little corner of the world where I could always count on something warm in a cup (or iced cold in summer) and a constant stream of life around me.

As an insomniac night owl, I’d roll in at 3 AM, laptop in hand, ready to get some work done or just people-watch. It was like stepping into a living, breathing world full of characters. 

You had the street kids, high schoolers, the regulars who’d been there since sundown, and some of the most *interesting* and *eclectic* (and sometimes annoying and crazy) people you’d meet anywhere. Homeless folks catching a break, people fresh out of bars, college students studying, and the odd local artist sketching away. Everyone had their own reason for being there, but it felt like we all had one thing in common: we were looking for something.

For me, it was refuge. When I was living in my van for 18 months, just trying to get by, that café became my second home. It wasn’t just a place to grab coffee—it was a space to exist, to work, and to just... be. I got to know the regulars. We’d chat, laugh, exchange stories. It was a kind of unspoken camaraderie. Like *Cheers*, but without the alcohol.

Maybe that’s what I miss the most. The feeling of being part of something, even if it was just a 24-hour café full of mismatched souls. In the chaos of it all, Shot in the Dark was the one place where I could breathe.

So, here's to you, Shot in the Dark Café. It may have been a little rough around the edges, but you were *my* place.

Maybe you were a lost soul, but at least you had a soul, something these corporate chain coffee spots popping up everywhere don’t even come close to.",60,1767186737.0,Tucson,14,0.98,False

an electric grinder

a whole table with posters hanging

Today update: Mom doesn't talk to me, doesn't talk to him. She didn't even feed my 7 years old sister and I cannot step feeling its my fault. I had plans with friends for NYE but I feel guilty and bad. I should have waited until January. Should I apologize? Would it help?

I (18M) for the past 2 years have seen a weird dynamic between my father (46) and my mother's younger sister (34). If it matters, my dad is slavic, frome astern europe. Cma here young and poor.

My dad is a guy with status. He is the VP of company that has production and branches in 8 countries and is not exactly modest about it. No one is smart enough to give him advice. In his field I am sure he is very skilled. But no one knows better than him even with unrelated things like what furniture to buy, why the dog won't eat and stuff like that. When we eat, my mother puts the plate in his face, puts the food on that plate. And he looks around and is like: the recipe for this steak says it should be eaten without salt? And my mother instantly jumps up and brings the salt she forgot. I told him: you can bring it yourself if you need it.

He works long hours, meetings after meetings and then goes to jog or to the gym or during winter he goes to the pool to swim. During that that my mother (who also has a full time job tries to hurry with the dinner. I try to help her all the time but I really don't think she should be doing all that for him.

This aunt of mine is pretty funny and doesn't take life too seriously. 34, no kids and divorced with a history of affairs with married guys that ended in drama. Dad treats her differently than he treats everyone. He talks down to people and everyone is walking on thin ice around him. But my aunt doesn't. S was rubbing his arm: So, Mr. big boss, have you peeled potatoes yourself? Because they are the best and we all know only you can make ""the best"" things. And then she laughed. And he laughed too. He doesn't laugh with us. Dad's hobby is making wine. And he took my aunt to see the grapes and put a grape himself in her mouth. Or he was mowing the lawn and she said: oo Mr Engineer doing the ordinary man work. Where are your servants? He laughed.

People who work under him at the company or directly with him are under constant stress because he treats them like in military. When  he is around people are tensed. She put her hand around his neck and said: what u say, bro in law, would you make me your secretary?  and he laughed and said: you would beat my a..ss. She: and you would deserve that and winks. If my mother needs a ride he is always busy.  but when my aunt called him at 10 pm to pick her up from the train station, he was at the office, but he went to pick her up.

I told Mom without using the word cheat. Just about my concerns and she got angry and threw a a coffee mug on the floor. She  cried and said to never repeat such nonsense. She also called Dad to tell him ""what I did"". ",10,1767186183.0,WhatShouldIDo,14,0.78,False

I don’t even know if this is the right sub so please remove my post if it isn’t

I F18 had a few weeks in October where I just lost the plot. I was meeting up with random older guys from Tinder for sex who were quite rough and I still have the bruises but I enjoyed it at the time and I was masturbating constantly even when it hurt and drinking every day and taking all sorts of drugs. I hardly slept too for that full time which I think just made things even worse. Like I’m not even joking I think I slept like 8 hours for the full 2 and a bit weeks or however long it was but I wasn’t even tired. Last time I felt like this I spent all my money trying to start this stupid beauty business even though everyone told me it was a dumb idea and I ended up making precisely $0. I’m still paying off my credit cards for that.

At the start of November I started feeling like shit and I’ve been so depressed and suicidal. Ive not been going to college and have fell behind on all my work and have just been sleeping all day and barely eating. My job at a coffee shop fired me a few weeks ago and I don’t even care because I didn’t have the energy to go. I told my manager I was feeling depressed but she said that it wasn’t good enough and I do understand we are busy at this time of year. But I really am depressed. I actually can’t remember the last time I actually ate something and I’m definitely dehydrated af. Like my pee is dark orange but I don’t have the energy to get a bottle of water. My flatmate has brought me sandwiches and water but she’s with her parents now until college starts again in a few weeks

Now I just found out I’m pregnant and I don’t even know who the father is. I fucking hate myself. I ordered some tests online and they are all positive except 1 but I don’t think I peed on it properly. I think my period was last in October at the start but I can’t remember for sure. I can’t believe I’ve let this happen and I hate myself. I am disgusting. Have all the drugs and alcohol hurt the baby? I’m such a mess and have no idea what to do. My parents are going to kill me and I’m probably gonna get kicked out of college because I haven’t turned in my assignments. I feel really bad if I’ve fucked the baby up with all the drinking and I also smoked weed and did cocaine and speed and other stuff I can’t even remember. Is there any way to check? Should I go to the doctor? What if the baby is deformed because of what I did? I’m on my parents health insurance plan so they’ll probably find out.  I have fucked up bad and my parents will probably disown me. I just feel like I’m stuck and can’t get out. I don’t know why I keep making these stupid choices which I hate myself for after. Now I feel like I’m being watched but I don’t even know who by. Even when I’m in bed with the covers over my head I feel like people can see me. I have these horrible blisters on my hips and elbows which are just getting worse. Getting out of bed is the hardest thing ever and The urge to just end it all is real.

I was used to the cold shoulder. People ghosting me? Fine. I was used to it.  
  
  
But getting iced out by a pilot? That was a first.  
  
  
The plane slammed onto the tarmac. I gripped the armrest so hard my knuckles turned white, my stomach lurching into my throat. I ripped off my headset, gasping for air.  
  
  
The pilot was already stalking around the side of the plane.  
  
  
His shoulders were locked tight. His face was stone cold. He was definitely the type that would make girls back home lose their minds.  
  
  
But me? Zero interest.  
  
  
Actually, I kind of wanted to punch him.  
  
  
When I boarded, I'd been polite. I said hello. And him? He looked right through me like I was a smudge on his pristine window, then turned away.  
  
  
Three hours in the air. The guy was a statue with a pulse. Aside from a cold ""Buckle up"" at takeoff, he hadn't said a word. When I finally asked how much longer, he shot me a look like I was speaking Alien.  
  
  
Now, he hoisted my heavy suitcase Like it was an empty cardboard box.  
  
  
I opened my mouth to say thanks, but he'd already grabbed my backpack with his other hand. He didn't even look at me. Just marched toward the metal shed.  
  
  
I ran after him. ""Hey, you don't have to - ""  
  
  
""Get the door.""  
  
  
Wow. Charming.  
  
  
Heat flared in my chest.  
  
  
I wasn't helpless. I didn't need him showing off. His ""help"" felt more like an insult. Who cares if he was hot? His personality was absolute trash.  
  
  
But I bit my tongue and picked up the pace to kick the door open.  
  
  
I was here for a fresh start. No point letting some frostbitten jerk ruin it.  
  
  
Not worth it.  
  
  
Inside, the heat hit me. A woman in a thick down jacket hurried over. Evelyn Vale, the principal.  
  
  
""You're finally here!"" She beamed, grabbing my hand. ""I hope Cormac didn't talk your ear off.""  
  
  
She winked at the ice block standing behind me.  
  
  
Cormac didn't even look up. He dropped my luggage at my feet with a heavy thud.  
  
  
""No, he was - ""  
  
  
Before I could finish, the door banged open. Cold wind swirled in, and just like that, he vanished into the snow.  
  
  
Like a phantom.  
  
  
...a rude, mute phantom.  
  
  
""He's a good pilot,"" I lied.  
  
  
Evelyn sighed. ""He's the best. Just colder than the permafrost. Anyway, welcome to Spruce Town, Elara.""  
  
  
""Thank you.""  
  
  
""Let's get you to the hotel. You look like you're about to pass out.""  
  
  
She wasn't wrong. Lately, life felt like sleepwalking. My brain was foggy, and my feet felt heavy, like I was walking on cotton.  
  
  
Evelyn's beat-up SUV bumped along the snowy road.  
  
  
At an intersection, she pointed to a small building across the street. ""There's your new battlefield - Tikkonnit Valley Middle School. One hundred and eighty-three people, total. Scared yet?""  
  
  
She shot me a teasing look.  
  
  
I couldn't help but laugh. ""Evelyn, back in Chicago, I handled three thousand kids. This? This is a vacation.""  
  
  
""Alright, city girl."" She turned the wheel. ""Let's get you settled. Here we are.""  
  
  
The car stopped.  
  
  
While Evelyn unloaded the bags, I stared at the ground. Suddenly, I froze.  
  
  
There were boot prints in the snow.  
  
  
But right next to them... massive paw prints.  
  
  
They were huge.Nightmares with fur.Definitely not a dog, and way bigger than any wolf I'd seen in a zoo. The claws had punched deep into the packed ice. It looked dangerous.  
  
  
That thing could rip a head off with one swipe.  
  
  
I gulped and pointed. ""Evelyn... do you get a lot of wild animals out here?""  
  
  
Her hand paused on the door handle.  
  
  
""It's winter. Bears, moose... sure."" Her eyes flickered with something I couldn't place. ""Oh, and wolves. They come around. Just don't mess with them, and they won't mess with you.""  
  
  
She pulled the door open with a comforting smile.  
  
  
Duh.  
  
  
Who's dumb enough to go poking a wolf, anyway?  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
It was dinnertime. The restaurant was a zoo.  
  
  
Evelyn was in full ""Show Pony"" mode. She paraded me around like a prize-winning poodle, introducing me to the postmaster, the hotel owner, and a dozen faceless locals whose names evaporated from my brain the second they hit the air.  
  
  
I wore my bulletproof fake smile. Shake hand. Nod. ""Lovely to meet you."" Repeat.  
  
  
Exhausted.  
  
  
I was more exhausted than I'd been after the ten-hour flight.  
  
  
I might have high-functioning depression, but that didn't stop me from winning the Oscar for Best Fake Normal Person. I knew how to make people feel like I was a breath of fresh air, even if my brain was just static snow.  
  
  
The second I got my room key, I fled .  
  
  
I locked the door.The world finally shut up.  
  
  
I pulled out my phone and texted my parents: Made it to Graytooth safe.  
  
  
Five minutes later, Mom [replied.One](http://replied.One) word: Received.  
  
  
I stared at that cold period until the screen went black.  
  
  
Right. Expected.  
  
  
A familiar chill rolled up from my stomach.Doctors called it a physical symptom. I called it what it was - emptiness.  
  
  
I stripped down to my lace underwear. The numbness inside was settling in, heavy and cold. I needed something sharp to cut through it. To confirm I was still here.  
  
  
I shoved the window open.  
  
  
Pitch black. No moon.The wind howled in, slashing my face like a razor.  
  
  
Good.  
  
  
Suddenly, a wolf howled in the distance - wild, mournful - and the sound echoed through the mountains.  
  
  
Possessed, I stepped barefoot onto the balcony.  
  
  
Forty below zero.The air froze my skin instantly, stinging like a thousand needles. The rush was immediate. Brutal.  
  
  
Then - a sound from below.  
  
  
Crunch.  
  
  
Boots crushing ice.  
  
  
I froze. Looked down.  
  
  
Directly below, standing on the street, was the damn mute pilot. Cormac.  
  
  
He was looking up. His eyes, usually hidden under his hood, were locked dead on me.  
  
  
It was still that same look, like I was trash, but now there was a flicker of shock. His gaze felt like it had hooks, scraping over my nearly naked body.  
  
  
His eyes asked a silent question: Is she high?  
  
  
The wind hit me again, and reality crashed in - I was wearing two scraps of lace.  
  
  
Shame erupted like lava, rushing straight to my face. I felt like I was burning up.  
  
  
Damn it, damn it, damn it!  
  
  
I scrambled back inside, slammed the window, and yanked the curtains shut.  
  
  
The room felt like a sauna now. I rushed to the bathroom, scrubbing my arms and face with a cold towel, trying to scrub the memory out of my brain.  
  
  
""Idiot,"" I hissed at the mirror.  
  
  
Not just depressed. Now I'm an exhibitionist, too. In his eyes, I was probably officially crazy.  
  
  
I checked the locks, killed the lights, and buried myself under the covers, playing dead.  
  
  
Minutes later, heavy footsteps echoed in the hall.  
  
  
Thud. Thud.  
  
  
Rhythmic. Heavy. Like they were stomping on my heart.  
  
  
The footsteps stopped. Right next door.  
  
  
The scrape of a key in a lock. The click of the tumblers turning. Loud in the silence.  
  
  
I stared at the ceiling in the dark, a dry laugh stuck in my throat.  
  
  
Are you playing with me, God?  
  
  
That stone-faced bastard is my neighbor?!  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
I didn't care about much these days - except teaching. Because that was about the future of a few dozen kids at Tikkonnit Valley High. I had to have some professional standards.  
  
  
First day. The bell rang. A few stragglers dragged themselves in and slumped into their seats like they were serving prison time.  
  
  
""Morning."" I cleared my throat. No small talk. ""I'm Ms. Brennan. Taking over for Mr. Hendricks.""  
  
  
""You read Dickens last semester, right?""  
  
  
A few slow, dull nods.  
  
  
""Did you like it?""  
  
  
Dead silence.  
  
  
I laughed.  
  
  
""Okay."" I tossed the textbook onto the desk. Thud.  
  
  
""I hate them too. Boring as hell.""  
  
  
Suddenly, the dead eyes in the room snapped open.  
  
  
""I have a lit degree, but I'm basic. I like sci-fi. Fantasy. Explosions. New rule: No dusty antiques. We're reading Howl's Moving Castle. Your assignment? Find a book you don't want to burn.""  
  
  
My old colleagues called it rebellious. I called it ""resurrecting the dead.""  
  
  
I handed out the books, and the room finally had a pulse.  
  
  
Win.  
  
  
...  
  
  
Time flew. I figured out the town's survival guide pretty fast.  
  
  
Two camps: The Welcome Wagon, and The Haters.  
  
  
Hank, the outdoor shop owner? Team Hater.  
  
  
One morning, he sneered between bites of bacon, ""Bet it's colder and darker here than you expected, huh?""  
  
  
I took a sip of coffee, not even looking up. ""Nope. Same as the Midwest.""  
  
  
He frowned, doubling down. ""Chicago doesn't have grizzlies.""  
  
  
""No,"" I said flatly. ""But I haven't seen any here either.""  
  
  
Behind me, Owen chuckled. ""She got you, Hank.""  
  
  
Owen was a local giant who rarely spoke. I liked him. Quiet meant I didn't have to perform.  
  
  
Claire, on the other hand, was the opposite.  
  
  
Her daily mission seemed to be auctioning me off to the local bachelors, like I was fresh meat for the gene pool. She'd shoo away tourists and force me into a circle of local men. It was subtle as a brick to the face.  
  
  
I couldn't tell her I had zero interest in men. Six months of therapy and antidepressants only taught me one thing: how to play the role of a functional human being.  
  
  
Meds plus caffeine. That was the only fuel keeping the machine running.  
  
  
Monday morning. I walked into the diner.  
  
  
""Elara!"" Claire's voice boomed. She waved excitedly at an empty bar stool.  
  
  
It was flanked by two local guys, sitting there like brick walls waiting for me. Another ambush setup.  
  
  
I sighed. Fine. Commit to the bit.  
  
  
I hung up my coat and resigned myself to the seat.  
  
  
I turned my head - and nearly jumped out of my skin.  
  
  
That damn bush pilot - Cormac - was sitting right across from me.  
  
  
The last time we met, I was the crazy exhibitionist shivering in my underwear on a balcony in forty-below weather.  
  
  
Our eyes locked.  
  
  
His relaxed face instantly froze. He looked away like he'd been tazed, acting like staring at me might actually blind him.  
  
  
Ants. That's what it felt like. Embarrassment crawling all over my skin.  
  
  
Oblivious to the weird vibe, Claire poured my coffee with a bright smile. ""Elara, have you two been properly introduced? This is Cormac Thorne.""  
  
  
I forced a stiff smile.  
  
  
Introduced?  
  
  
Ha.  
  
  
We were way past a simple ""met.""

Beer in hand, Emmett Wilson reclined across his faux leather couch. He’d been working construction *all day*, and his body ached from hours of installing prefabricated wall paneling. Do It Right Builders, his employer, was building a new Fallbrook housing development, a plague of tract homes, carving out miles of vegetation in their quest to pave over the planet. Still, the job covered his rent, so he couldn’t complain too much.   

 

His forty-two-inch television was on, broadcasting a *Futurama* rerun Emmett found hard to follow, his mind drifting along its own currents. Mainly, he contemplated women he’d dated over the years, wondering if any of them had been worth holding onto. The prior week, he’d dumped his last girlfriend, a clingy Puerto Rican with daddy issues and a penchant for club hopping. 

 

The program cut to commercials, and so Emmett channel surfed, eventually settling on a soccer match. Portugal was playing France, the game presently tied. In the stands, the audience was going wild, and some of that enthusiasm seemed to leak from the television, drawing Emmett from his ruminations.

 

Suddenly, he was on his seat’s edge, Heineken clutched in a death grip. In Emmett’s youth, he’d spent many weekend hours with his father, watching any game that happened to be televised. Oftentimes, the man had recited obscure soccer trivia until Emmett’s eyes glazed over. 

 

Reminiscing about those lazy weekends, Emmett observed a strange phenomenon arising. The televised image seemed to curve, as if there was another transmission pushing its way past the broadcast. Both field and players formed into a strangely shifting face, like a movie projected onto a Mount Rushmore visage. Then the screen went black. 

 

“What the hell?” Emmett gasped, overwhelmed with fear and adrenaline. He pushed the power button, but the screen remained black, unplugged and re-plugged the cord to no result. Apparently, the monitor on his two-month-old TV had burned out already—a grave injustice. He’d have to dig up the manufacturer’s warranty.  

 

He picked a *Maxim* off his coffee table, flipped through dog-eared photo spreads and twice-read articles before slapping it down in frustration. He considered logging onto Facebook, but the social networking site always left him feeling dirty, spying on people he barely remembered. Instead, he considered the radio.

 

It had been a Christmas gift from his ex-girlfriend, one he’d had little use for thus far. An Investutech brand portable satellite radio, it resembled an engorged black iPod with a thick antenna set atop it. After a twenty-minute charge, its LED screen glowed neon blue, awaiting activation. 

 

Emmett jammed the headphones into his ears and began scanning the stations. Nineties alt-rock segued to jazz. Commercial rap morphed into insipid pop. Still he pressed forward, searching for something new, something worth devoting an hour to. As he scanned, he wandered his apartment.   

 

*“And that was The Olivia Tremor Control with ‘California Demise,’”* enthused the radio personality on the latest station. The DJ’s voice seemed off somehow, like a woman feigning masculinity. But the tail end of the song had left Emmett’s interest piqued, so he listened on.

 

*“A fantastic tune from a fantastic band. And believe me, we know bands here at Radio PC. We’ll hit you with another block of mad melodies soon enough, but first I’d like to share a special tale with you, my loyal listener.* 

 

*“You see, there once was a boy named Douglas Stanton. Little Dougie was a special child, and entered existence during Oceanside’s famous poltergeist panic.”*

 

Emmett’s mouth dropped open. He nearly spilled his beer as Douglas’ name brought his perambulation to a halt. 

 

They’d been friends throughout their elementary and middle school years, wasting endless hours in meaningless pursuits. But they’d drifted apart prior to high school, and Emmett had no idea what had become of his erstwhile cohort. 

 

*“You probably remember the story: a newborn was strangled by his mother, yet somehow returned to life at the end of an apparition outbreak. It was all over the news, and remains a tabloid favorite nearly two decades later. It’s the reason that a multimillion-dollar medical center now stands vacant, its staff having migrated to facilities all across Southern California.* 

 

*“In the weeks following the event, Oceanside Memorial was investigated by a steady stream of government spooks, from the FBI to NTAC. After that proved inconclusive, a team of psychics and postcogs swept the premises. Their impressions were shared with few, and many of those so-called experts have since taken their own lives. A flurry of lawsuits followed the paranormal outburst, and many of the day’s survivors found fame discussing their ordeals in newspapers, magazines, and televised interviews.*

 

*“One man would have nothing to do with the media feeding frenzy. Instead, Carter Stanton kept his son barricaded in their Calle Tranquila home. He quit his job, and would not return to employment until Douglas entered preschool. Carter kept the boy away from his mother, who’d been sent to Milford Asylum, an Orange County psychiatric facility.* 

 

*“In fact, Carter secluded the boy from all extended family, kept him in their house at all times, save for infrequent doctor visits. On the rare times when Carter left the house for any task longer than a grocery run, he called a babysitting service, never hiring the same girl twice.* 

 

*“The sitters would be fine when he left, but always white-faced and shell-shocked upon his return, if they’d remained at all. Not that Douglas was a bad child, mind you. Quite the opposite. The boy never cried, never did much of anything but stare at the mobile hanging above his crib, a rotating exhibit of stars and comets.*

 

*“No, what frightened the girls was the persistent ghost activity: unexplained thumping behind the walls, objects flying off of shelves, voices in the ether. One sitter glimpsed her great aunt in the bathroom mirror, her face obscured by grave mold, but that was as bad as it ever got in the child’s early years.*

 

*“Now Carter Stanton was no fool. He may have retreated deep within himself, and given up on most of life’s little joys, but he knew a haunting when he saw one. Still, the apparitions seemed more mischievous than evil, unlike the ghouls from the hospital. And something had brought his boy back from death, after all. Maybe the specters were keeping him alive in some nebulous way, ensuring that his heart pumped and his neurons connected.* 

 

*“But sometimes the man wondered, particularly when little Douglas’ first word turned out to be ‘Gresillons,’ which were ancient torture devices used to squash toes and fingertips. Carter doubted that he’d picked that up from a babysitter.”*

 

\*          \*          \*

 

“Hey, Ghost Boy, my dad says you’re possessed. Is that true?”

 

Douglas looked up from his peanut butter and banana sandwich, one hand shielding his eyes from the sun. Seven-years-old now, he sat at the bottom of Campanula Elementary School’s metal slide, peering up at his antagonist, Clark Clemson. Clark’s two gangly cohorts stood beside him, licking their lips in anticipation. 

 

Douglas looked from the playground to its adjacent lunch tables, searching out someone in authority, finding all adults conspicuously absent. He’d hoped to pass his lunch break unnoticed, but the bully had again singled him out. 

 

“I’m not possessed,” he sighed, knowing that Clark wouldn’t let it go at that. 

 

“Then why’s your momma gone crazy? I heard she’s locked away in a nuthatch, and they ain’t never gonna let her out.” Clark’s beady eyes narrowed; his body twitched with restrained violence. Above a face rapidly reddening, his crew cut sparkled with sweat.   

 

Douglas—a thin, dark-haired boy in secondhand clothes—kept his mouth fastened. The last time he’d talked back to Clark, he’d gone home with a split lip. Lowering his gaze to his sandwich, he wondered if it was safe to take a bite.

 

“Look at me when I talk to you, freak!” Clark had moved closer; his right forefinger hovered accusingly before Douglas’ face. 

 

Douglas refused, provoking Clark to slap the sandwich from his grip. After kicking much sand atop it, the bully led his cronies away. All in all, Douglas had gotten off lightly. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

From her classroom window, Catherine Gonzalez watched Douglas trudge from the slide to the swing set, whereupon he hung dejectedly. No child joined him on the playground; the school’s enrollees had been conditioned to avoid him by peers and parents alike. Aside from the intermittent bullying, no one said a word to Douglas. 

 

And Catherine was just as guilty as the rest of them. As his teacher, she’d addressed him only when absolutely necessary, had purposely “forgotten” to contact Carter Stanton when scheduling parent-teacher conferences. 

 

A matronly woman in her early fifties, Catherine had been teaching at Campanula Elementary School for the better part of three years, driving over from Vista every work morning. She enjoyed commuting to the site, located just off Mesa Drive, about halfway between North Santa Fe Avenue and the Pacific Ocean. She liked that its student population was relatively small: less than two hundred kids spread across six grades. She adored her children, especially the way that their faces lit up after they solved difficult problems. 

 

But Catherine didn’t like Douglas. Every time she got near him, she caught a chill, leaving the little hairs on her arms and neck standing in petrification. It was like walking alone into an empty tomb. 

 

As she watched, the boy began to swing, his pendulum motion taking him higher and higher. Strangely, he remained statue-still, moving without pumping his legs. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Turning onto Calle Tranquila, Carter maneuvered his battered Nissan Pathfinder toward their box-shaped single-story home, lurking just after the street’s bend.  

 

For a moment, the shadows shifted in such a way that Carter perceived black fungi enveloping the residence. A single blink returned its smooth stucco exterior. The plantation shutters were drawn, but light seeped out through the slats, informing him of his son’s presence. 

 

The family’s savings being long since depleted, Carter had returned to work, this time gaining employment as an air conditioner engineer. At all times of day, he serviced and installed Investutech brand air conditioning systems, visiting businesses and residences throughout San Diego County. 

 

Oftentimes, he left for work before his son awoke, as many jobs required early starts. Similarly, he usually returned after Douglas had finished his school day. It was fortunate that their home was only a quarter mile from Campanula Elementary and Douglas didn’t mind walking. 

 

There were no babysitters anymore; the previous child-minders had gossiped their household into oblivion. Agencies had been warned against the Stantons, and the odious neighborhood spinsters wouldn’t even make eye contact with Carter anymore. So Douglas had become a latchkey kid, learning to prepare his own meals and find his own amusement. 

 

In the attached garage, Carter pressed the clicker, commencing the mechanical door’s track-guided descent. For just a moment, he fantasized about leaving his vehicle running, letting its exhaust pull him gently into extinction. Instead, he passed a palm over his ever-expanding bald spot and keyed off the ignition.    

 

Stepping into the house, he heard the familiar sound of his heels slapping travertine tiles. He heard something else, as well. Douglas was speaking, his comically high-pitched voice rising in excitement. 

 

“…and then Superman punched out Braniac, while Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen covered the story for *The Daily Planet*.”

 

In the living room, Carter found his son sprawled across their upholstered yellow couch. Intently studying a comic book, the boy didn’t notice his father until the man cleared his throat. 

 

“Hi, Dad.”

 

“Hello, Son. Whom were you speaking to just now?”

 

“Oh, that’s my friend, Frank. He’s an astronaut.”

 

“An astronaut, huh? Shouldn’t he be in space then, rather than listening to tales from your funny book?”

 

“He can’t fly anymore, Dad. He’s dead.”

 

Carter shivered. Whether this Frank was an imaginary friend or a poltergeist, he had no idea. But at least the guy was friendly, unlike some of the other visitors Douglas had entertained, presences that left the boy lachrymose under a bed sheet barrier.

 

“Well, you just tell Frank to leave you alone now. I’m making Cajun-style salmon for dinner, and you get to help.”

 

“Alright!”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

With dinner finished, Douglas brushed his teeth and prepared for bed. Upon entering his room—its walls covered in X-Men and Green Lantern posters—he found the top drawer of his dresser ajar. As if self-aware, a pajama top flew out from its depths, landing across Douglas’ shoulder. 

 

“Frank, is that you?” The question went unanswered, signifying a different presence. 

 

Douglas trailed many spirits in his wake, but only Commander Gordon had proven a decent conversationalist. When the rest bothered to speak at all, it was to whine about their hollow existences, to plead for aid Douglas was unable to provide. Some moaned unintelligibly. 

 

Generally, the presences were content to remain invisible, but sometimes their translucent figures could be glimpsed at vision’s edge. Occasionally, one would manifest upon a reflective surface, hollow eyes within a face of white clay. 

 

“*Too little, too little*,” an ancient voice whispered in his ear. 

 

Douglas didn’t bother requesting clarity. Wringing a rational conversation from a despondent shade was tiresome, and the boy had school in the morning. Dressed for slumber, he lost himself in a blanket cocoon. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Vinyl covered foam rumbled beneath him as the school bus thundered down the road. Children screamed from all sides, but Douglas spoke not. No one sat beside him and the girls across the aisle—Missy Peterson and Etta Williams—shot him strange looks as they whispered back and forth. 

 

They were visiting Old Mission San Luis Rey for a fieldtrip, to explore the site’s historic church and view artifacts spanning the area’s history, from the Luiseño Indians to the 20^(th) century Franciscans. Mrs. Gonzalez had been hyping the excursion for weeks, and Douglas hoped that the experience would live up to her publicity.

 

*Splat!* A spitball slapped the back of his neck, leaving Douglas shuddering in revulsion. He turned around to see Clark Clemson looming over the seat, biting down on a striped straw. 

 

“What’s wrong, Ghost Boy? Did a spook try to give you a hickey?” This brought a laugh from Clark’s seatmate, a hoarse bray exclusive to Milo Black. “Just wait until we get to the Mission. I bet an Injun ghost tries to scalp ya.”   

 

With Mrs. Gonzalez at the bus’ anterior, her gaze carefully focused upon traffic, Douglas’ hopelessness grew palpable. Just once, he wished that someone would stick up for him, but his fellow students either ignored the situation or leaned forward expectantly, their ghoulish faces lit with violent fantasies. 

 

“What did I ever do to you, Clark? Why can’t you leave me alone for once?”

 

Clark let the question slide off of him. In fact, he leaned forward and flicked Douglas in the temple. As he laughed, his hot breath washed over Douglas, its scent so malignant, it spoke volumes about the bully’s oral hygiene. 

 

“Here, let me through,” Clark said to Milo, and suddenly he was sharing Douglas’ seat. The larger boy imprisoned Douglas in a tight headlock, which lasted until they reached the Mission. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Irwin Michaels stared at his television in agony, his sinuses swollen to the point where every breath was tribulation. Wadded tissues surrounded his pullout couch nest, wherein he reclined befuddled, periodically sipping tepid Sprite. 

 

On *Saved by the Bell*, the gang had formed a band called Zack Attack, a pop group currently performing its smash single, “Friends Forever.” But Irwin hardly gave a damn, being too busy cursing his malady. 

 

*And it just had to happen on field trip day*, he thought to himself. *I could be hanging out with Clark and Milo right now, goofing on that little fruit, Douglas. Clark mentioned that he had a special surprise lined up for Ghost Boy after school, and now I have to miss it.* 

 

The program segued to commercials. Looking up, Irwin glimpsed something that slashed through his feverish thoughts, that made him wish he wasn’t home alone. There was a shadow on the wall, just above the television, one cast by nothing present. It formed the outline of a tall, skinny man, improbably wearing a top hat. 

 

Irwin shivered, his already pale face growing several shades lighter. His mother had warned him to go easy on the cough medicine, but she’d never mentioned hallucinations. 

 

The shadow left the wall, gliding across Berber carpet. Merrily, it capered toward immobile Irwin. 

 

“Stop,” Irwin said feebly, his command ignored by the presence. Cavorting joyously, it drew ever nearer. 

 

As the shadow fell across him, Irwin’s ragged yell dissolved into a wet gurgle. 

 

Later, after the pathologist completed his autopsy, it was determined that Irwin’s death was caused by a massive stroke, the result of a previously undiscovered temporal lobe aneurism. Of what had turned the boy’s hair completely white, the physician offered no explanation.

Shaking with impotence and restrained enmity, Douglas entered his house, his face a gummy mess of eggshells and half-dried yolk, through which tear tracks steadily streamed. Snot trickled from his nostrils, adding to the disarray of the boy’s countenance.    

 

The field trip had been interesting, if a little dry. His class toured the site’s lavanderia, quadrangle and church, and then the ruins of the Mission’s barracks. They’d studied a number of artifacts and art pieces spanning California’s history, of which the vivid oil paintings of Leon Trousset and Miguel Cabrera had most impressed him. 

 

Only the cemetery had troubled Douglas, from the skull and crossbones carved into its entrance to the disturbing whispers he’d heard drifting from the Franciscan crypts. The place had sent shivers down his spine—too many ancient specters struggling to make themselves known. 

 

No, the trip to Old Mission San Luis Rey had turned out just fine, all things considered. His misery stemmed from after school.  

 

To reach his home’s comforting confines, Douglas traversed two paved hills, passing cul-de-sacs and crosswalks along the way. Walnut trees loomed leftward for much of his journey, marking the beginnings of ice plant covered slopes, ascending to the fenced-in backyards of still more neighborhoods.      

 

Douglas had been whistling softly to himself, moving ever closer to his humble abode, when his vision was suddenly obscured by the inside of a brown paper bag. Pulled tightly over his head by an unseen assailant, the bag was not empty. Ovaloid objects had pressed his skull from all corners, shattering from outside blows to ooze slowly down his face.

 

When Douglas was released and allowed to pull the soaked bag off his cranium, he’d glimpsed the giggling faces of Clark and Milo staring back. 

 

“See ya later, dickhead,” bellowed Clark, as they’d sauntered away. 

 

Standing shivering in the midday sun, Douglas experienced a succession of violent fantasies, wherein he mutilated his tormentors beyond all recognition. He’d wanted to run after them, to tackle Clark to the ground and bash his head against the pavement until brains dribbled from a bifurcated skull. Instead, Douglas had run home sobbing, pierced by the stares of passing motorists. 

 

Screaming in rage, Douglas slammed his backpack to the floor. He twisted the shower into life, setting it to scalding, wanting to punish himself for his history of cowardice. 

 

After suffering his way through a scorching deluge, he toweled off and climbed into fresh clothes. Gradually, he became cognizant of a living room noise. 

 

“Dad? Is that you?” 

 

There came no reply, so Douglas cautiously tiptoed down the hallway, fearing the appearance of a masked burglar, or maybe Clark. Instead, he encountered an empty living room, wherein the television had been switched on, as had Douglas’ Nintendo gaming system. The noise he’d heard resolved into the bouncy *Super Mario Bros* soundtrack\*.\*

 

A controller floated fourteen inches above the tile. Douglas watched it maneuver an Italian-American plumber all throughout Mushroom Kingdom, pelting Goombas and Koopa Troopas with fireballs along the way. The controller seemed to be operating without human input, but when Douglas turned his head, he saw a small boy in the corner of his eye. 

 

The boy was chalk-white and emaciated, his ragged sweater covered in sludgy brown stains. He appeared captivated with the task before him, and Douglas felt his own rage slipping away as he surreptitiously observed his visitor.  

 

Eventually, Douglas moved to the boy’s immediate proximity. Sitting cross-legged upon the tile, he watched the dead child traverse his avatar through one horizontal landscape after another. The presence made his skin tingle, caused the little hairs on Douglas’ arms to stand at attention, but he remained unafraid. 

 

At last, when the task of overcoming Bowser had proven too difficult for the young specter, Douglas snatched the remote from open air. 

 

“Here, let me show you how it’s done.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

That night, as he drifted off to sleep, Douglas heard voices in his mattress: high-pitched squeaks, nearly intelligible. They frightened him profoundly, although he wasn’t clear why. The vocalizations were hardly his first messages from the great beyond, yet these voices held a sinister quality that caused his brain to clench. 

 

He felt that if he could understand them, the voices would reveal terrible truths: eldritch data that would shift the entire planet into an alien wasteland. Babbling in nefarious dialects, they pursued him into dreamland.   

 

\*          \*          \*

 

“Hey, your name’s Douglas, right?” 

 

Squinting, he appraised a chubby, bespectacled stranger. It being lunchtime, Douglas was seated at his customary position at the slide’s terminal point. Realizing that he wasn’t alone, he immediately tensed, expecting a sudden smack to the head or milk carton shower.

 

“Yeah, that’s me,” he replied warily. 

 

“Cool. I’m Benjy Rothstein. And this here is my best friend, Emmett.”         

 

The boy with the unfortunate red cowlick stepped aside, allowing a skinny African-American to move forward.

 

“Hey, how you doing?” Emmett asked.

 

Douglas grunted out a reply, his eyes manifesting misgivings. Benjy paid the mistrust no mind, however, calmly removing his horn-rimmed glasses and breath-fogging the lenses. Cleaning them with the bottom of his checkered shirt, he remarked, “Anyway, we’re in the other second grade class, and we noticed that nobody likes you.”

 

Face reddening, Douglas said nothing. 

 

“No, don’t get me wrong. We just think it’s weird that a perfectly good playground goes unused, just because you may or may not have been born in a haunted hospital.” 

 

Douglas took a bite of his celery, realizing from Benjy’s jovial tone that there’d be no attack.  

 

“Yeah, everyone acts like you’re a zombie, or something,” chimed in Emmett. “You’re not going to attack me, are you?”

 

“No,” Douglas replied, still chewing. 

 

“Cool, then we’re gonna hit the swings.” 

 

Douglas watched the two seat themselves and begin gaining altitude. Their uninhibited laughter drew him from his stasis, and soon he found himself swinging alongside them. The swing set rocked in its foundations as they kicked their way skyward. Sunrays beat sweat from their pores.  

 

The bell sounded, pulling them from their daydreams, back into dusty classrooms crammed with diminutive desks and chairs. As they branched into separate directions, Benjy turned to Douglas and said, “Hey, Emmett and I are hitting the mall after school. You wanna come?”

 

“Sure…I guess,” replied Douglas. He’d never been to a mall before, and envisioned a cross between a theme park and a Wal-Mart awaiting him. 

 

“Cool. Meet us in front of the school when class gets out.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

While the reality of the shopping center proved more mundane than he’d expected, Douglas treasured his time therein. 

 

After a tense ride into Carlsbad, during which Benjy’s morbidly obese mother repeatedly shot Douglas ugly looks, the children were turned loose within the air-conditioned confines of the Westfield Plaza Camino Real Mall. They wandered the place aimlessly, drifting from one store to another. They ate at Hot Dog on a Stick, rode the glass-walled elevator up and down for a half-hour straight, perused the funny birthday cards at Spencer’s Gifts, and claimed a bench whereupon they could spy on escalator passengers. Leaving the bench, the trio made up stories about the goths at Hot Topic while gorging at The Sweet Factory. By the time they were retrieved two hours later, they had exhausted every avenue of adventure the establishment offered.

 

Returning home, Douglas glimpsed something in the window adjacent to his front door. Twisted faces had formed in the condensation, their dribbling outlines stretched in torment. Douglas gasped, his stomach clenching at the sight. But Benjy’s mother had already pulled away, leaving him no choice but to enter, shivering as he crossed the threshold. 

 

“Dad!” he called out hopefully, but no reply greeted him. His father was out, most likely wrist-deep in some malfunctioning air conditioner. And so, stomach still reeling from his food court binge, Douglas opted to rinse off the day’s accumulated grime. 

 

The shower featured a large window with a view of the backyard. It was high enough that no inquisitive neighbor would catch a glimpse of Douglas’ privates, yet low enough that he could peer out as he washed. At first, Douglas feared that the ghoulish faces had moved to this window, but it remained unblemished. Reassured by normalcy, he indulged in a leisurely shower, mentally replaying the day’s events. 

 

It seemed that Douglas had friends now, flesh and blood friends who actually enjoyed his company. He wasn’t sure how it had happened, but the prospect of another school day now seemed somewhat tolerable. At lunchtime, he would meet up with Emmett and Benjy again; maybe they’d hang out after school. 

 

Then his friends were forgotten, as the soothing downpour grew frigid. While his view should have revealed only a dead grass stretch enclosed by weatherworn fence planks, the backyard had manifested myriad spirits. They stood like transparent statues, freezing him with ravenous glances. Each bore evidence of advanced decay; some were hardly more than skeletons. Neither moving nor speaking, they watched him, glowing faintly against the night’s blackness. 

 

It being the first time spirits had manifested in his direct line of vision, Douglas found himself unable to move. He was afraid to let them see his fear, which might encourage a spectral home invasion. Instead, he’d towel off and find a safer spot in which to await his father’s return. 

 

He had just begun drying himself when the power suddenly went out. Terror vibrations grew overwhelming, bringing tears silently trickling. Wrapping the towel around his waist, he tried to exit the bathroom. No such luck. The door was stuck in its jamb, and no amount of struggling could coax it open.  

 

In complete darkness, he strained against the door. The luminescent backyard figures loomed foremost on his mind, with the room’s rapidly plummeting temperature attesting to their closing proximity. Soon, whispers crammed his earshot, an ever-shifting susurrus: dozens of voices muttering simultaneously. 

 

Generally, the murmur mosaic remained unintelligible, but the scant few articulations he could make out wrung hoarse sobs from Douglas’ diaphragm. They spoke of the graveyard’s everlasting chill, promising Douglas that his current loneliness would hardly compare to what he’d feel upon becoming discorporate. Some could only cry in abject misery.         

 

The voices grew louder, until deafening screams resounded throughout his makeshift prison. Objects flew from the medicine cabinet: toothbrushes, pill bottles, shaving cream, hair gel and toothpaste. They swirled overhead, gripped by a phantasmal hurricane, as Douglas beat his hands bloody against the door. 

 

At last, when Douglas’ screams had become indistinguishable from the greater cacophony, the door swung open, spilling him onto the tile floor. Wasting not a second, he crawled from the bathroom, and forced himself to appraise his savior.  

 

A figure stood before him, dressed in a bulky white space suit. Through the garment’s visor, a broad-faced man with a wide, flat nose could be seen. The astronaut smiled beneficently, as the bathroom screams trickled away into insignificance. The flying detritus crashed to the floor, and silence returned to the Stanton home. 

 

“Frank, is that you?” Douglas asked, having known the astronaut only as a disembodied voice. 

 

*“Commander Frank Gordon at your service. It’s good to finally look you in the eyes, Douglas.”*

 

“Wha…what just happened? I thought I was going to die in there.” 

 

*“The spirits are growing stronger, and it’s all because of you.”* Gordon replied. *“Now get dressed, boy. We have much to discuss.”*

 

\*          \*          \*

 

After some minor hyperventilation, Douglas found himself seated upon his mustard-colored couch, clutching a glass of orange juice between frigid fingers. Frank Gordon levitated before him, his toes six inches above the floor. 

 

“You said these ghosts are my fault. What do you mean?” Douglas asked bluntly. 

 

*“I didn’t say they’re your fault. I said that they’re here because of you. Now sip your juice quietly, boy, and I’ll spin you a story.”*

 

After a dramatic pause, Gordon began: *“You see, Douglas, when an individual dies, their soul ends up in this place; let’s call it the Phantom Cabinet. The Phantom Cabinet is a strange place: a realm of spectral mists, a desolate land sculpted of spirit static. Inside of it, one’s essence floats, encountering other souls and soul fragments as it travels.* 

 

*“With every spirit encountered, the deceased is bombarded with details of that person’s life. Foreign dreams, desires, and fears are absorbed into the deceased’s essence, as the deceased leaves pieces of their own spirit behind. Eventually, the deceased’s spirit will dissolve completely into the spectral foam, which is the stuff from which new souls are crafted. Are you following me?”*

 

Lying through his teeth, Douglas said that he was. There is only so much that a seven-year-old’s mind can grasp, after all, and little Douglas was pushing his noggin’s limits. Still, he sat quietly, respectfully listening to the astronaut’s story.

 

*“Now…that is the natural way of things. It provides a sort of reincarnation, as pieces of a person’s fragmented essence go into the souls of unborn infants. Not everybody follows the rules, however.* 

 

“*Some spirits resist the soul breakdown, floating around the Phantom Cabinet entirely undivided. This can be due to any number of factors, such as pure evilness or a refusal to accept one’s demise. These stubborn bastards can remain bodiless for all eternity.”* 

 

Gordon made a face, as if he’d sniffed something foul. *“Even worse, segments of some personalities are excluded from the spectral foam, remaining solid like bones in soup. Especially strong hatreds and fears resist the soul breakdown process, even after their owners dissolve into phantom froth. When enough of these segments gather together, they can actually amalgamate, forming into demons and other unnatural entities.”*

 

“Is that what I’ve been seeing, demons?”

 

*“No, you’ve been facing garden variety specters so far, common spooks such as myself. But as your power grows, those other entities will start appearing, as they’ve visited others from time to time, during brief destabilizations in the afterlife’s grip. Many are driven mad upon such a meeting, so keep your guard up.*

 

*“The Phantom Cabinet has been referred to by many names: Purgatory, Heaven, and Hell being just a few. There’s something in it of the Hindu akasha, and even a dash of Plato’s Realm of the Forms. Sometimes, big dreamers are permitted glimpses of the Cabinet, inspiring them to great acts of creation or driving them hopelessly insane. It exists deep in the void, a soul-magnet broadcasting irresistible attraction. No ghost can escape from it, at least not until now.”*

 

“Why now? And what’s it got to do with me?”

 

*“Well, I don’t know the exact science of it, but it had something to do with my crew’s last mission, which we never came back from. You see, Space Shuttle Conundrum launched from a secret desert location on an uncharted trajectory. Somehow, that trajectory brought us into the afterlife.* 

 

*“The process was similar to an eclipse, I think. The Phantom Cabinet aligned with a portion of our atmosphere, weakening the barrier between both domains. With the right tool, in this case our spacecraft, it became possible to penetrate the obstruction.*  

 

*“When our shuttle breached the Phantom Cabinet, we levered it open slightly, just wide enough for a child’s spirit to slip out. That child was you, Douglas. You died at the exact moment that we breached the spirit realm. Like every other dead person, your soul was pulled into the Phantom Cabinet.* 

 

*“Would that it had stayed there, little buddy, but somehow you clawed your way back, trailing a horde of angry specters in your wake. They plagued Oceanside Memorial for a while, before being pulled back within you, your undeveloped power unable to support their efforts for long. They are tied to you, boy, tethered to your proximity.”*

 

Gordon attempted a fatherly gesture, an intangible shoulder pat that slid right through Douglas. *“Unfortunately, more spirits cross over each day. You are their doorway, Douglas. Half your soul remains in the Phantom Cabinet, bridging it with the living world. Through you, the Cabinet’s influence continues to grow, giving Oceanside a ghost population. Even I passed through you on the way here.”*  

 

Douglas tried to reply, but could produce no cogent remark. The astronaut’s words shook him down to his core, leaving him drowning in revelations. At some point in the tale, he’d spilled his orange juice, leaving the glass nearly empty. Still he clutched it, desperate for something to grasp.

 

*“Every time we talk, I have to battle my way through more and more poltergeists, hidden deep inside of you. We all leech your spectral power, Douglas, though some are better at it than others. Eventually, your power will grow so considerable that we will be able to remain in the open air indefinitely. Woe is mankind on that day.”*

 

The astronaut’s face grew melancholy. *“I have to leave now, Douglas, but remember what I said. Write it down and keep it safe, so that you might better understand future occurrences. It could be some time before our next meeting, and I wouldn’t want to leave you empty-handed.”*

 

In a split-second, Commander Gordon was gone. Minutes later, Carter Stanton finally arrived, bearing pizza and the news of Irwin Michaels’ demise. While the food was appreciated, Douglas could spare no tears for the apprentice bully. His mind was drifting amidst the stars, contemplating the myriad mysteries contained therein.   

 

When his father entered the bathroom, Douglas expected to be punished for the mess the spirits had left. But the man made no comments upon exiting, and tossed no glances in his son’s direction. 

 

Later, on trembling toes, Douglas forced himself to examine the area. Everything was as it had been; the medicine cabinet was closed and filled. Had the whole thing been an illusion, or had Frank Gordon done Douglas a favor before disappearing back into the ether? Either way, the place remained frightening.

 

Before drifting off to sleep, Douglas pulled a wire bound notebook from his teak dresser and began to write. In childish scrawl, his script brimming with misspellings, he managed to replicate Gordon’s message nearly verbatim. Over ensuing years, he returned to the notebook again and again, yet the words never grew mundane.    ",1,1767185918.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

Beer in hand, Emmett Wilson reclined across his faux leather couch. He’d been working construction *all day*, and his body ached from hours of installing prefabricated wall paneling. Do It Right Builders, his employer, was building a new Fallbrook housing development, a plague of tract homes, carving out miles of vegetation in their quest to pave over the planet. Still, the job covered his rent, so he couldn’t complain too much.   

 

His forty-two-inch television was on, broadcasting a *Futurama* rerun Emmett found hard to follow, his mind drifting along its own currents. Mainly, he contemplated women he’d dated over the years, wondering if any of them had been worth holding onto. The prior week, he’d dumped his last girlfriend, a clingy Puerto Rican with daddy issues and a penchant for club hopping. 

 

The program cut to commercials, and so Emmett channel surfed, eventually settling on a soccer match. Portugal was playing France, the game presently tied. In the stands, the audience was going wild, and some of that enthusiasm seemed to leak from the television, drawing Emmett from his ruminations.

 

Suddenly, he was on his seat’s edge, Heineken clutched in a death grip. In Emmett’s youth, he’d spent many weekend hours with his father, watching any game that happened to be televised. Oftentimes, the man had recited obscure soccer trivia until Emmett’s eyes glazed over. 

 

Reminiscing about those lazy weekends, Emmett observed a strange phenomenon arising. The televised image seemed to curve, as if there was another transmission pushing its way past the broadcast. Both field and players formed into a strangely shifting face, like a movie projected onto a Mount Rushmore visage. Then the screen went black. 

 

“What the hell?” Emmett gasped, overwhelmed with fear and adrenaline. He pushed the power button, but the screen remained black, unplugged and re-plugged the cord to no result. Apparently, the monitor on his two-month-old TV had burned out already—a grave injustice. He’d have to dig up the manufacturer’s warranty.  

 

He picked a *Maxim* off his coffee table, flipped through dog-eared photo spreads and twice-read articles before slapping it down in frustration. He considered logging onto Facebook, but the social networking site always left him feeling dirty, spying on people he barely remembered. Instead, he considered the radio.

 

It had been a Christmas gift from his ex-girlfriend, one he’d had little use for thus far. An Investutech brand portable satellite radio, it resembled an engorged black iPod with a thick antenna set atop it. After a twenty-minute charge, its LED screen glowed neon blue, awaiting activation. 

 

Emmett jammed the headphones into his ears and began scanning the stations. Nineties alt-rock segued to jazz. Commercial rap morphed into insipid pop. Still he pressed forward, searching for something new, something worth devoting an hour to. As he scanned, he wandered his apartment.   

 

*“And that was The Olivia Tremor Control with ‘California Demise,’”* enthused the radio personality on the latest station. The DJ’s voice seemed off somehow, like a woman feigning masculinity. But the tail end of the song had left Emmett’s interest piqued, so he listened on.

 

*“A fantastic tune from a fantastic band. And believe me, we know bands here at Radio PC. We’ll hit you with another block of mad melodies soon enough, but first I’d like to share a special tale with you, my loyal listener.* 

 

*“You see, there once was a boy named Douglas Stanton. Little Dougie was a special child, and entered existence during Oceanside’s famous poltergeist panic.”*

 

Emmett’s mouth dropped open. He nearly spilled his beer as Douglas’ name brought his perambulation to a halt. 

 

They’d been friends throughout their elementary and middle school years, wasting endless hours in meaningless pursuits. But they’d drifted apart prior to high school, and Emmett had no idea what had become of his erstwhile cohort. 

 

*“You probably remember the story: a newborn was strangled by his mother, yet somehow returned to life at the end of an apparition outbreak. It was all over the news, and remains a tabloid favorite nearly two decades later. It’s the reason that a multimillion-dollar medical center now stands vacant, its staff having migrated to facilities all across Southern California.* 

 

*“In the weeks following the event, Oceanside Memorial was investigated by a steady stream of government spooks, from the FBI to NTAC. After that proved inconclusive, a team of psychics and postcogs swept the premises. Their impressions were shared with few, and many of those so-called experts have since taken their own lives. A flurry of lawsuits followed the paranormal outburst, and many of the day’s survivors found fame discussing their ordeals in newspapers, magazines, and televised interviews.*

 

*“One man would have nothing to do with the media feeding frenzy. Instead, Carter Stanton kept his son barricaded in their Calle Tranquila home. He quit his job, and would not return to employment until Douglas entered preschool. Carter kept the boy away from his mother, who’d been sent to Milford Asylum, an Orange County psychiatric facility.* 

 

*“In fact, Carter secluded the boy from all extended family, kept him in their house at all times, save for infrequent doctor visits. On the rare times when Carter left the house for any task longer than a grocery run, he called a babysitting service, never hiring the same girl twice.* 

 

*“The sitters would be fine when he left, but always white-faced and shell-shocked upon his return, if they’d remained at all. Not that Douglas was a bad child, mind you. Quite the opposite. The boy never cried, never did much of anything but stare at the mobile hanging above his crib, a rotating exhibit of stars and comets.*

 

*“No, what frightened the girls was the persistent ghost activity: unexplained thumping behind the walls, objects flying off of shelves, voices in the ether. One sitter glimpsed her great aunt in the bathroom mirror, her face obscured by grave mold, but that was as bad as it ever got in the child’s early years.*

 

*“Now Carter Stanton was no fool. He may have retreated deep within himself, and given up on most of life’s little joys, but he knew a haunting when he saw one. Still, the apparitions seemed more mischievous than evil, unlike the ghouls from the hospital. And something had brought his boy back from death, after all. Maybe the specters were keeping him alive in some nebulous way, ensuring that his heart pumped and his neurons connected.* 

 

*“But sometimes the man wondered, particularly when little Douglas’ first word turned out to be ‘Gresillons,’ which were ancient torture devices used to squash toes and fingertips. Carter doubted that he’d picked that up from a babysitter.”*

 

\*          \*          \*

 

“Hey, Ghost Boy, my dad says you’re possessed. Is that true?”

 

Douglas looked up from his peanut butter and banana sandwich, one hand shielding his eyes from the sun. Seven-years-old now, he sat at the bottom of Campanula Elementary School’s metal slide, peering up at his antagonist, Clark Clemson. Clark’s two gangly cohorts stood beside him, licking their lips in anticipation. 

 

Douglas looked from the playground to its adjacent lunch tables, searching out someone in authority, finding all adults conspicuously absent. He’d hoped to pass his lunch break unnoticed, but the bully had again singled him out. 

 

“I’m not possessed,” he sighed, knowing that Clark wouldn’t let it go at that. 

 

“Then why’s your momma gone crazy? I heard she’s locked away in a nuthatch, and they ain’t never gonna let her out.” Clark’s beady eyes narrowed; his body twitched with restrained violence. Above a face rapidly reddening, his crew cut sparkled with sweat.   

 

Douglas—a thin, dark-haired boy in secondhand clothes—kept his mouth fastened. The last time he’d talked back to Clark, he’d gone home with a split lip. Lowering his gaze to his sandwich, he wondered if it was safe to take a bite.

 

“Look at me when I talk to you, freak!” Clark had moved closer; his right forefinger hovered accusingly before Douglas’ face. 

 

Douglas refused, provoking Clark to slap the sandwich from his grip. After kicking much sand atop it, the bully led his cronies away. All in all, Douglas had gotten off lightly. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

From her classroom window, Catherine Gonzalez watched Douglas trudge from the slide to the swing set, whereupon he hung dejectedly. No child joined him on the playground; the school’s enrollees had been conditioned to avoid him by peers and parents alike. Aside from the intermittent bullying, no one said a word to Douglas. 

 

And Catherine was just as guilty as the rest of them. As his teacher, she’d addressed him only when absolutely necessary, had purposely “forgotten” to contact Carter Stanton when scheduling parent-teacher conferences. 

 

A matronly woman in her early fifties, Catherine had been teaching at Campanula Elementary School for the better part of three years, driving over from Vista every work morning. She enjoyed commuting to the site, located just off Mesa Drive, about halfway between North Santa Fe Avenue and the Pacific Ocean. She liked that its student population was relatively small: less than two hundred kids spread across six grades. She adored her children, especially the way that their faces lit up after they solved difficult problems. 

 

But Catherine didn’t like Douglas. Every time she got near him, she caught a chill, leaving the little hairs on her arms and neck standing in petrification. It was like walking alone into an empty tomb. 

 

As she watched, the boy began to swing, his pendulum motion taking him higher and higher. Strangely, he remained statue-still, moving without pumping his legs. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Turning onto Calle Tranquila, Carter maneuvered his battered Nissan Pathfinder toward their box-shaped single-story home, lurking just after the street’s bend.  

 

For a moment, the shadows shifted in such a way that Carter perceived black fungi enveloping the residence. A single blink returned its smooth stucco exterior. The plantation shutters were drawn, but light seeped out through the slats, informing him of his son’s presence. 

 

The family’s savings being long since depleted, Carter had returned to work, this time gaining employment as an air conditioner engineer. At all times of day, he serviced and installed Investutech brand air conditioning systems, visiting businesses and residences throughout San Diego County. 

 

Oftentimes, he left for work before his son awoke, as many jobs required early starts. Similarly, he usually returned after Douglas had finished his school day. It was fortunate that their home was only a quarter mile from Campanula Elementary and Douglas didn’t mind walking. 

 

There were no babysitters anymore; the previous child-minders had gossiped their household into oblivion. Agencies had been warned against the Stantons, and the odious neighborhood spinsters wouldn’t even make eye contact with Carter anymore. So Douglas had become a latchkey kid, learning to prepare his own meals and find his own amusement. 

 

In the attached garage, Carter pressed the clicker, commencing the mechanical door’s track-guided descent. For just a moment, he fantasized about leaving his vehicle running, letting its exhaust pull him gently into extinction. Instead, he passed a palm over his ever-expanding bald spot and keyed off the ignition.    

 

Stepping into the house, he heard the familiar sound of his heels slapping travertine tiles. He heard something else, as well. Douglas was speaking, his comically high-pitched voice rising in excitement. 

 

“…and then Superman punched out Braniac, while Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen covered the story for *The Daily Planet*.”

 

In the living room, Carter found his son sprawled across their upholstered yellow couch. Intently studying a comic book, the boy didn’t notice his father until the man cleared his throat. 

 

“Hi, Dad.”

 

“Hello, Son. Whom were you speaking to just now?”

 

“Oh, that’s my friend, Frank. He’s an astronaut.”

 

“An astronaut, huh? Shouldn’t he be in space then, rather than listening to tales from your funny book?”

 

“He can’t fly anymore, Dad. He’s dead.”

 

Carter shivered. Whether this Frank was an imaginary friend or a poltergeist, he had no idea. But at least the guy was friendly, unlike some of the other visitors Douglas had entertained, presences that left the boy lachrymose under a bed sheet barrier.

 

“Well, you just tell Frank to leave you alone now. I’m making Cajun-style salmon for dinner, and you get to help.”

 

“Alright!”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

With dinner finished, Douglas brushed his teeth and prepared for bed. Upon entering his room—its walls covered in X-Men and Green Lantern posters—he found the top drawer of his dresser ajar. As if self-aware, a pajama top flew out from its depths, landing across Douglas’ shoulder. 

 

“Frank, is that you?” The question went unanswered, signifying a different presence. 

 

Douglas trailed many spirits in his wake, but only Commander Gordon had proven a decent conversationalist. When the rest bothered to speak at all, it was to whine about their hollow existences, to plead for aid Douglas was unable to provide. Some moaned unintelligibly. 

 

Generally, the presences were content to remain invisible, but sometimes their translucent figures could be glimpsed at vision’s edge. Occasionally, one would manifest upon a reflective surface, hollow eyes within a face of white clay. 

 

“*Too little, too little*,” an ancient voice whispered in his ear. 

 

Douglas didn’t bother requesting clarity. Wringing a rational conversation from a despondent shade was tiresome, and the boy had school in the morning. Dressed for slumber, he lost himself in a blanket cocoon. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Vinyl covered foam rumbled beneath him as the school bus thundered down the road. Children screamed from all sides, but Douglas spoke not. No one sat beside him and the girls across the aisle—Missy Peterson and Etta Williams—shot him strange looks as they whispered back and forth. 

 

They were visiting Old Mission San Luis Rey for a fieldtrip, to explore the site’s historic church and view artifacts spanning the area’s history, from the Luiseño Indians to the 20^(th) century Franciscans. Mrs. Gonzalez had been hyping the excursion for weeks, and Douglas hoped that the experience would live up to her publicity.

 

*Splat!* A spitball slapped the back of his neck, leaving Douglas shuddering in revulsion. He turned around to see Clark Clemson looming over the seat, biting down on a striped straw. 

 

“What’s wrong, Ghost Boy? Did a spook try to give you a hickey?” This brought a laugh from Clark’s seatmate, a hoarse bray exclusive to Milo Black. “Just wait until we get to the Mission. I bet an Injun ghost tries to scalp ya.”   

 

With Mrs. Gonzalez at the bus’ anterior, her gaze carefully focused upon traffic, Douglas’ hopelessness grew palpable. Just once, he wished that someone would stick up for him, but his fellow students either ignored the situation or leaned forward expectantly, their ghoulish faces lit with violent fantasies. 

 

“What did I ever do to you, Clark? Why can’t you leave me alone for once?”

 

Clark let the question slide off of him. In fact, he leaned forward and flicked Douglas in the temple. As he laughed, his hot breath washed over Douglas, its scent so malignant, it spoke volumes about the bully’s oral hygiene. 

 

“Here, let me through,” Clark said to Milo, and suddenly he was sharing Douglas’ seat. The larger boy imprisoned Douglas in a tight headlock, which lasted until they reached the Mission. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Irwin Michaels stared at his television in agony, his sinuses swollen to the point where every breath was tribulation. Wadded tissues surrounded his pullout couch nest, wherein he reclined befuddled, periodically sipping tepid Sprite. 

 

On *Saved by the Bell*, the gang had formed a band called Zack Attack, a pop group currently performing its smash single, “Friends Forever.” But Irwin hardly gave a damn, being too busy cursing his malady. 

 

*And it just had to happen on field trip day*, he thought to himself. *I could be hanging out with Clark and Milo right now, goofing on that little fruit, Douglas. Clark mentioned that he had a special surprise lined up for Ghost Boy after school, and now I have to miss it.* 

 

The program segued to commercials. Looking up, Irwin glimpsed something that slashed through his feverish thoughts, that made him wish he wasn’t home alone. There was a shadow on the wall, just above the television, one cast by nothing present. It formed the outline of a tall, skinny man, improbably wearing a top hat. 

 

Irwin shivered, his already pale face growing several shades lighter. His mother had warned him to go easy on the cough medicine, but she’d never mentioned hallucinations. 

 

The shadow left the wall, gliding across Berber carpet. Merrily, it capered toward immobile Irwin. 

 

“Stop,” Irwin said feebly, his command ignored by the presence. Cavorting joyously, it drew ever nearer. 

 

As the shadow fell across him, Irwin’s ragged yell dissolved into a wet gurgle. 

 

Later, after the pathologist completed his autopsy, it was determined that Irwin’s death was caused by a massive stroke, the result of a previously undiscovered temporal lobe aneurism. Of what had turned the boy’s hair completely white, the physician offered no explanation. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Shaking with impotence and restrained enmity, Douglas entered his house, his face a gummy mess of eggshells and half-dried yolk, through which tear tracks steadily streamed. Snot trickled from his nostrils, adding to the disarray of the boy’s countenance.    

 

The field trip had been interesting, if a little dry. His class toured the site’s lavanderia, quadrangle and church, and then the ruins of the Mission’s barracks. They’d studied a number of artifacts and art pieces spanning California’s history, of which the vivid oil paintings of Leon Trousset and Miguel Cabrera had most impressed him. 

 

Only the cemetery had troubled Douglas, from the skull and crossbones carved into its entrance to the disturbing whispers he’d heard drifting from the Franciscan crypts. The place had sent shivers down his spine—too many ancient specters struggling to make themselves known. 

 

No, the trip to Old Mission San Luis Rey had turned out just fine, all things considered. His misery stemmed from after school.  

 

To reach his home’s comforting confines, Douglas traversed two paved hills, passing cul-de-sacs and crosswalks along the way. Walnut trees loomed leftward for much of his journey, marking the beginnings of ice plant covered slopes, ascending to the fenced-in backyards of still more neighborhoods.      

 

Douglas had been whistling softly to himself, moving ever closer to his humble abode, when his vision was suddenly obscured by the inside of a brown paper bag. Pulled tightly over his head by an unseen assailant, the bag was not empty. Ovaloid objects had pressed his skull from all corners, shattering from outside blows to ooze slowly down his face.

 

When Douglas was released and allowed to pull the soaked bag off his cranium, he’d glimpsed the giggling faces of Clark and Milo staring back. 

 

“See ya later, dickhead,” bellowed Clark, as they’d sauntered away. 

 

Standing shivering in the midday sun, Douglas experienced a succession of violent fantasies, wherein he mutilated his tormentors beyond all recognition. He’d wanted to run after them, to tackle Clark to the ground and bash his head against the pavement until brains dribbled from a bifurcated skull. Instead, Douglas had run home sobbing, pierced by the stares of passing motorists. 

 

Screaming in rage, Douglas slammed his backpack to the floor. He twisted the shower into life, setting it to scalding, wanting to punish himself for his history of cowardice. 

 

After suffering his way through a scorching deluge, he toweled off and climbed into fresh clothes. Gradually, he became cognizant of a living room noise. 

 

“Dad? Is that you?” 

 

There came no reply, so Douglas cautiously tiptoed down the hallway, fearing the appearance of a masked burglar, or maybe Clark. Instead, he encountered an empty living room, wherein the television had been switched on, as had Douglas’ Nintendo gaming system. The noise he’d heard resolved into the bouncy *Super Mario Bros* soundtrack\*.\*

 

A controller floated fourteen inches above the tile. Douglas watched it maneuver an Italian-American plumber all throughout Mushroom Kingdom, pelting Goombas and Koopa Troopas with fireballs along the way. The controller seemed to be operating without human input, but when Douglas turned his head, he saw a small boy in the corner of his eye. 

 

The boy was chalk-white and emaciated, his ragged sweater covered in sludgy brown stains. He appeared captivated with the task before him, and Douglas felt his own rage slipping away as he surreptitiously observed his visitor.  

 

Eventually, Douglas moved to the boy’s immediate proximity. Sitting cross-legged upon the tile, he watched the dead child traverse his avatar through one horizontal landscape after another. The presence made his skin tingle, caused the little hairs on Douglas’ arms to stand at attention, but he remained unafraid. 

 

At last, when the task of overcoming Bowser had proven too difficult for the young specter, Douglas snatched the remote from open air. 

 

“Here, let me show you how it’s done.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

That night, as he drifted off to sleep, Douglas heard voices in his mattress: high-pitched squeaks, nearly intelligible. They frightened him profoundly, although he wasn’t clear why. The vocalizations were hardly his first messages from the great beyond, yet these voices held a sinister quality that caused his brain to clench. 

 

He felt that if he could understand them, the voices would reveal terrible truths: eldritch data that would shift the entire planet into an alien wasteland. Babbling in nefarious dialects, they pursued him into dreamland.   

 

\*          \*          \*

 

“Hey, your name’s Douglas, right?” 

 

Squinting, he appraised a chubby, bespectacled stranger. It being lunchtime, Douglas was seated at his customary position at the slide’s terminal point. Realizing that he wasn’t alone, he immediately tensed, expecting a sudden smack to the head or milk carton shower.

 

“Yeah, that’s me,” he replied warily. 

 

“Cool. I’m Benjy Rothstein. And this here is my best friend, Emmett.”         

 

The boy with the unfortunate red cowlick stepped aside, allowing a skinny African-American to move forward.

 

“Hey, how you doing?” Emmett asked.

 

Douglas grunted out a reply, his eyes manifesting misgivings. Benjy paid the mistrust no mind, however, calmly removing his horn-rimmed glasses and breath-fogging the lenses. Cleaning them with the bottom of his checkered shirt, he remarked, “Anyway, we’re in the other second grade class, and we noticed that nobody likes you.”

 

Face reddening, Douglas said nothing. 

 

“No, don’t get me wrong. We just think it’s weird that a perfectly good playground goes unused, just because you may or may not have been born in a haunted hospital.” 

 

Douglas took a bite of his celery, realizing from Benjy’s jovial tone that there’d be no attack.  

 

“Yeah, everyone acts like you’re a zombie, or something,” chimed in Emmett. “You’re not going to attack me, are you?”

 

“No,” Douglas replied, still chewing. 

 

“Cool, then we’re gonna hit the swings.” 

 

Douglas watched the two seat themselves and begin gaining altitude. Their uninhibited laughter drew him from his stasis, and soon he found himself swinging alongside them. The swing set rocked in its foundations as they kicked their way skyward. Sunrays beat sweat from their pores.  

 

The bell sounded, pulling them from their daydreams, back into dusty classrooms crammed with diminutive desks and chairs. As they branched into separate directions, Benjy turned to Douglas and said, “Hey, Emmett and I are hitting the mall after school. You wanna come?”

 

“Sure…I guess,” replied Douglas. He’d never been to a mall before, and envisioned a cross between a theme park and a Wal-Mart awaiting him. 

 

“Cool. Meet us in front of the school when class gets out.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

While the reality of the shopping center proved more mundane than he’d expected, Douglas treasured his time therein. 

 

After a tense ride into Carlsbad, during which Benjy’s morbidly obese mother repeatedly shot Douglas ugly looks, the children were turned loose within the air-conditioned confines of the Westfield Plaza Camino Real Mall. They wandered the place aimlessly, drifting from one store to another. They ate at Hot Dog on a Stick, rode the glass-walled elevator up and down for a half-hour straight, perused the funny birthday cards at Spencer’s Gifts, and claimed a bench whereupon they could spy on escalator passengers. Leaving the bench, the trio made up stories about the goths at Hot Topic while gorging at The Sweet Factory. By the time they were retrieved two hours later, they had exhausted every avenue of adventure the establishment offered.

 

Returning home, Douglas glimpsed something in the window adjacent to his front door. Twisted faces had formed in the condensation, their dribbling outlines stretched in torment. Douglas gasped, his stomach clenching at the sight. But Benjy’s mother had already pulled away, leaving him no choice but to enter, shivering as he crossed the threshold. 

 

“Dad!” he called out hopefully, but no reply greeted him. His father was out, most likely wrist-deep in some malfunctioning air conditioner. And so, stomach still reeling from his food court binge, Douglas opted to rinse off the day’s accumulated grime. 

 

The shower featured a large window with a view of the backyard. It was high enough that no inquisitive neighbor would catch a glimpse of Douglas’ privates, yet low enough that he could peer out as he washed. At first, Douglas feared that the ghoulish faces had moved to this window, but it remained unblemished. Reassured by normalcy, he indulged in a leisurely shower, mentally replaying the day’s events. 

 

It seemed that Douglas had friends now, flesh and blood friends who actually enjoyed his company. He wasn’t sure how it had happened, but the prospect of another school day now seemed somewhat tolerable. At lunchtime, he would meet up with Emmett and Benjy again; maybe they’d hang out after school. 

 

Then his friends were forgotten, as the soothing downpour grew frigid. While his view should have revealed only a dead grass stretch enclosed by weatherworn fence planks, the backyard had manifested myriad spirits. They stood like transparent statues, freezing him with ravenous glances. Each bore evidence of advanced decay; some were hardly more than skeletons. Neither moving nor speaking, they watched him, glowing faintly against the night’s blackness. 

 

It being the first time spirits had manifested in his direct line of vision, Douglas found himself unable to move. He was afraid to let them see his fear, which might encourage a spectral home invasion. Instead, he’d towel off and find a safer spot in which to await his father’s return. 

 

He had just begun drying himself when the power suddenly went out. Terror vibrations grew overwhelming, bringing tears silently trickling. Wrapping the towel around his waist, he tried to exit the bathroom. No such luck. The door was stuck in its jamb, and no amount of struggling could coax it open.  

 

In complete darkness, he strained against the door. The luminescent backyard figures loomed foremost on his mind, with the room’s rapidly plummeting temperature attesting to their closing proximity. Soon, whispers crammed his earshot, an ever-shifting susurrus: dozens of voices muttering simultaneously. 

 

Generally, the murmur mosaic remained unintelligible, but the scant few articulations he could make out wrung hoarse sobs from Douglas’ diaphragm. They spoke of the graveyard’s everlasting chill, promising Douglas that his current loneliness would hardly compare to what he’d feel upon becoming discorporate. Some could only cry in abject misery.         

 

The voices grew louder, until deafening screams resounded throughout his makeshift prison. Objects flew from the medicine cabinet: toothbrushes, pill bottles, shaving cream, hair gel and toothpaste. They swirled overhead, gripped by a phantasmal hurricane, as Douglas beat his hands bloody against the door. 

 

At last, when Douglas’ screams had become indistinguishable from the greater cacophony, the door swung open, spilling him onto the tile floor. Wasting not a second, he crawled from the bathroom, and forced himself to appraise his savior.  

 

A figure stood before him, dressed in a bulky white space suit. Through the garment’s visor, a broad-faced man with a wide, flat nose could be seen. The astronaut smiled beneficently, as the bathroom screams trickled away into insignificance. The flying detritus crashed to the floor, and silence returned to the Stanton home. 

 

“Frank, is that you?” Douglas asked, having known the astronaut only as a disembodied voice. 

 

*“Commander Frank Gordon at your service. It’s good to finally look you in the eyes, Douglas.”*

 

“Wha…what just happened? I thought I was going to die in there.” 

 

*“The spirits are growing stronger, and it’s all because of you.”* Gordon replied. *“Now get dressed, boy. We have much to discuss.”*

 

\*          \*          \*

 

After some minor hyperventilation, Douglas found himself seated upon his mustard-colored couch, clutching a glass of orange juice between frigid fingers. Frank Gordon levitated before him, his toes six inches above the floor. 

 

“You said these ghosts are my fault. What do you mean?” Douglas asked bluntly. 

 

*“I didn’t say they’re your fault. I said that they’re here because of you. Now sip your juice quietly, boy, and I’ll spin you a story.”*

 

After a dramatic pause, Gordon began: *“You see, Douglas, when an individual dies, their soul ends up in this place; let’s call it the Phantom Cabinet. The Phantom Cabinet is a strange place: a realm of spectral mists, a desolate land sculpted of spirit static. Inside of it, one’s essence floats, encountering other souls and soul fragments as it travels.* 

 

*“With every spirit encountered, the deceased is bombarded with details of that person’s life. Foreign dreams, desires, and fears are absorbed into the deceased’s essence, as the deceased leaves pieces of their own spirit behind. Eventually, the deceased’s spirit will dissolve completely into the spectral foam, which is the stuff from which new souls are crafted. Are you following me?”*

 

Lying through his teeth, Douglas said that he was. There is only so much that a seven-year-old’s mind can grasp, after all, and little Douglas was pushing his noggin’s limits. Still, he sat quietly, respectfully listening to the astronaut’s story.

 

*“Now…that is the natural way of things. It provides a sort of reincarnation, as pieces of a person’s fragmented essence go into the souls of unborn infants. Not everybody follows the rules, however.* 

 

“*Some spirits resist the soul breakdown, floating around the Phantom Cabinet entirely undivided. This can be due to any number of factors, such as pure evilness or a refusal to accept one’s demise. These stubborn bastards can remain bodiless for all eternity.”* 

 

Gordon made a face, as if he’d sniffed something foul. *“Even worse, segments of some personalities are excluded from the spectral foam, remaining solid like bones in soup. Especially strong hatreds and fears resist the soul breakdown process, even after their owners dissolve into phantom froth. When enough of these segments gather together, they can actually amalgamate, forming into demons and other unnatural entities.”*

 

“Is that what I’ve been seeing, demons?”

 

*“No, you’ve been facing garden variety specters so far, common spooks such as myself. But as your power grows, those other entities will start appearing, as they’ve visited others from time to time, during brief destabilizations in the afterlife’s grip. Many are driven mad upon such a meeting, so keep your guard up.*

 

*“The Phantom Cabinet has been referred to by many names: Purgatory, Heaven, and Hell being just a few. There’s something in it of the Hindu akasha, and even a dash of Plato’s Realm of the Forms. Sometimes, big dreamers are permitted glimpses of the Cabinet, inspiring them to great acts of creation or driving them hopelessly insane. It exists deep in the void, a soul-magnet broadcasting irresistible attraction. No ghost can escape from it, at least not until now.”*

 

“Why now? And what’s it got to do with me?”

 

*“Well, I don’t know the exact science of it, but it had something to do with my crew’s last mission, which we never came back from. You see, Space Shuttle Conundrum launched from a secret desert location on an uncharted trajectory. Somehow, that trajectory brought us into the afterlife.* 

 

*“The process was similar to an eclipse, I think. The Phantom Cabinet aligned with a portion of our atmosphere, weakening the barrier between both domains. With the right tool, in this case our spacecraft, it became possible to penetrate the obstruction.*  

 

*“When our shuttle breached the Phantom Cabinet, we levered it open slightly, just wide enough for a child’s spirit to slip out. That child was you, Douglas. You died at the exact moment that we breached the spirit realm. Like every other dead person, your soul was pulled into the Phantom Cabinet.* 

 

*“Would that it had stayed there, little buddy, but somehow you clawed your way back, trailing a horde of angry specters in your wake. They plagued Oceanside Memorial for a while, before being pulled back within you, your undeveloped power unable to support their efforts for long. They are tied to you, boy, tethered to your proximity.”*

 

Gordon attempted a fatherly gesture, an intangible shoulder pat that slid right through Douglas. *“Unfortunately, more spirits cross over each day. You are their doorway, Douglas. Half your soul remains in the Phantom Cabinet, bridging it with the living world. Through you, the Cabinet’s influence continues to grow, giving Oceanside a ghost population. Even I passed through you on the way here.”*  

 

Douglas tried to reply, but could produce no cogent remark. The astronaut’s words shook him down to his core, leaving him drowning in revelations. At some point in the tale, he’d spilled his orange juice, leaving the glass nearly empty. Still he clutched it, desperate for something to grasp.

 

*“Every time we talk, I have to battle my way through more and more poltergeists, hidden deep inside of you. We all leech your spectral power, Douglas, though some are better at it than others. Eventually, your power will grow so considerable that we will be able to remain in the open air indefinitely. Woe is mankind on that day.”*

 

The astronaut’s face grew melancholy. *“I have to leave now, Douglas, but remember what I said. Write it down and keep it safe, so that you might better understand future occurrences. It could be some time before our next meeting, and I wouldn’t want to leave you empty-handed.”*

 

In a split-second, Commander Gordon was gone. Minutes later, Carter Stanton finally arrived, bearing pizza and the news of Irwin Michaels’ demise. While the food was appreciated, Douglas could spare no tears for the apprentice bully. His mind was drifting amidst the stars, contemplating the myriad mysteries contained therein.   

 

When his father entered the bathroom, Douglas expected to be punished for the mess the spirits had left. But the man made no comments upon exiting, and tossed no glances in his son’s direction. 

 

Later, on trembling toes, Douglas forced himself to examine the area. Everything was as it had been; the medicine cabinet was closed and filled. Had the whole thing been an illusion, or had Frank Gordon done Douglas a favor before disappearing back into the ether? Either way, the place remained frightening.

 

Before drifting off to sleep, Douglas pulled a wire bound notebook from his teak dresser and began to write. In childish scrawl, his script brimming with misspellings, he managed to replicate Gordon’s message nearly verbatim. Over ensuing years, he returned to the notebook again and again, yet the words never grew mundane.    ",1,1767185896.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I wanted your advice regarding dealing with coupled-up friends while being single myself.

I've got a pretty good life going on: interesting job, cool apartment, cute pet, lots of solo hobbies. I've recently moved to my home country after an expat phase, met a few new people and also reconnected with friends that I'd met before or during my time abroad. My issue is that ALL these people are prioritising their relationship over friendships, no matter the quality of either:

\- Example #1: met A through a network of like-minded women (ie community-oriented, independent, ambitious), getting to know her and actually enjoying spending time with her and it seems mutuals. She sent multiple signals that my being sinle would automatically exclude me from bonding further. For example: she's engaged and after her wedding (not planned yet), she wants to do a friends trip as her honeymoon with ""other couples"". No single friend included (aany single friend, not me particularly)

\- Example #2: met friend B through a common hobby abroad 2 years ago when we were both happily single, then moved back to our country, in the same city and around the same time last year. We share a deep bond, coffees turn into all-afternoon dates, ""quick"" calls last hours, etc. She's leaving tonight for a year-long trip and I couldn't get to see her because she's spending all her free time with a guy she met this summer and has been somewhat ""official"" with for less than a month.

It's hard enough to meet new people in a new city, and even harder to specifically find compatible *single* friends. Right now it feels like I can only come 2nd in everybody's life, because any romantic relationship (even if new and shallow) and coupled-up friends will always take precedence. What makes it even more annoying is that, even I was in a relationship, I always made sure to take care of my friends and devote time to them. 

Any wisdom to share on this matter?

1q0c7yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jim21869/comments/1q0c7yb/friends_and_family_chapter_18/,Friends and Family (Chapter 18),"Things seemed to get better as the fall of 1984 progressed.  The friendship between the Marlowe bunch and those in the neighborhood continued to grow.  Three of the Marlowe kids (Jonathan, Zoe and Allison) became the newest members of the Salem Church Youth Ensemble.  Jim thought, *I sure wish they were in Charlotte earlier when we were taking those trips.  They would have been welcome to additions to our group.  And we sure would have had just as much fun together, if not more*.

At the church, Reverend Q started three new things. 

First, there would be coffee, sodas, iced tea and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts served between Sunday school and the morning worship service.  Reverend Q said he did this at his old church, and it seemed to not only boost church membership and attendance, but church morale as well.  Everyone agreed with Reverend Q.  Everyone liked the idea.

Second, Reverend Q would begin each service with The Apostle’s Creed.  He was doing “substitute preacher duty” at a Lutheran church one time.  It was the first time he had ever heard The Apostle’s Creed.  He liked how it sounded.  He figured it would probably be good for Salem Church. 

And third, one Sunday a month would be declared “Youth Sunday.”  On this day, the youth would pretty much take over the church.  The youth ensemble would sing a song or two during the morning service.  There would be a solo sung by a youth member (or a duet, or a trio, or maybe a quartet).  And on occasion, a youth member would deliver a sermon.  The service would be “youth oriented.”

 

😊

 

In the first week of November, Salem Church had an opportunity to perform on “The Sunday Gospel Show” on Channel 3.  Reverend Q chose to let the six who performed at that little church in Lansing perform.  That included Jim, Candi, Todd, Paulina, Sydney and April Lynn.  Reverend Q had the four do the same songs they performed that summer evening, minus the Valvoline commercial parody.        

That episode was sponsored by Gilmore Auto Sales.    Pam got Jim and Paulina to help do the commercials.  Pam, Jim and Paulina described two used automobiles on sale at the used car lot.  One was a red 1982 Chevy Monte Carlo, and the other was a black 1976 Dodge Aspen.  They all had a lot of fun doing the show, as well as the commercials.  Come that Sunday, that episode would be on Channel 3.

It was the second Sunday in November.  Jim was getting ready for church.  Wendy would be unable to attend because she had to report to work at Charlotte Produce Company.  There was a special project she had to be involved in. 

Jim stepped downstairs into the living room.  He was wearing an orange polo shirt with blue slacks.  Jim was not sure if the colors matched, but he did the best he could.  Jim asked Wendy if he looked okay.  She said he did.

Jim went into the kitchen.  He made him a glass of iced tea, and he got him a cup of peach yogurt out of the refrigerator.  Jim said, “Mom, I hate it you cannot attend services today.”

“I know, sweetie.  I hate it, too.  But I do have to work today.  I have no idea what this special project is.  But I guess I’ll find out when I get there.”

“Any idea how long you’ll have to work?”

“Probably not all day.  Three hours.  Maybe four, no more than that.”

“What time do you have to be at work?”

Wendy answered, “I have to be there at nine.”

Jim looked at the clock on the microwave.  It read 7:50.  Sunday school at Salem Church did not start until 9:30.  The worship service started at 10:30.  Both Sunday school and the morning worship service used to start a half an hour later.  After the name of the church was changed from Bethany Church to Salem Church (and after Reverend Q’s arrival), the start times for both Sunday school and the worship were moved back a half an hour earlier. 

At eight o’clock, Channel 3 aired “The Sunday Gospel Show.”  Wendy was getting ready for work.  After the announcer announced that this week’s show was sponsored by Gilmore Auto Sales, Jim said to Wendy, “Mom.  Get in here.  We’re on TV.”

“Who’s we?” Wendy asked.

“Me, Todd, Candi, Paulina, Sydney and April Lynn.”

Wendy quickly grabbed two cans of Coke out of the refrigerator and went into the living room.  Wendy sat down on the sofa beside Jim, and she gave a can of Coke to Jim.  The two did not say a word.  They just sat there and watched.  After the show, Jim told Wendy about the taping, and the two commercials he and Paulina helped Pam do.  Wendy was extremely impressed by the whole thing.

Jim was about ready to leave.  He got his Bible and Sunday school book.  Jim announced that he was leaving for church.  Before he got out the door, Wendy asked him, “Jim, would you like a ride to church?”

“Thanks, Mom.  But I think I’ll walk.  Salem Church is a short walk from here and it really is a beautiful day.”

“Okay.  It’s possible I may be here when you get home.”

Jim stepped out the door.  He felt it was a little cool, so he grabbed him a light sweater.  He put it on, and he was on his way to church.  It was cool, around 45 degrees.  But it was nice and sunny.  The trees were still changing in color.  There were some leaves falling off the trees and blowing in nearly every direction. 

Jim arrived at Salem Church.  He saw the Marlowe kids waiting for him at the door.  Jonathan, Zoe and Allison were now members of the Salem Church Youth Ensemble.  Jonathan was dressed almost like Jim only his polo shirt was light blue.  Allison was wearing a white blouse with a lot of lace and ruffles and a gray skirt.  Zoe was wearing a dark blue suit with a white blouse and a scarf around her neck.  Right away, Jim thought Zoe and Allison looked pretty.  Jim, along with the other guys, always liked it when girls dressed like girls, and not tomboys.  When Jim met Candi, she was wearing a blouse and a skirt.  But that was not the biggest reason why Jim liked Candi enough to have her for a girlfriend.  Jim liked Candi because she was beautiful, sweet, and had a nice attitude.  Jim felt the same way about Zoe and Allison.  Not only them, but all the other females he had for friends.  Jim felt even though he was friends with those girls, it was up to him to make them feel special.  With the promise he made to them (and the guys as well), he felt he was doing just that.

That Sunday was the first “Youth Sunday” at Salem Church.  After Sunday school, doughnuts were served, along with ham biscuits.  Coke, coffee and iced tea were served as well.  Sure enough, everyone enjoyed it.  And it would really boost church morale, which was what Reverend Q was wanting to do.  Jim sat beside Candi in the fellowship hall.  Candi was looking very pretty this fall morning, wearing a dark gray suit and a white blouse with a big bow in the middle.                    

After the food was served, everyone gathered in the sanctuary for the morning worship service.  The service took on a new format.  After the congregation sang the Doxology, Reverend Q delivered the opening prayer, and then the congregation mumbled The Apostle’s Creed.  Then they sang the opening hymn, and then they mumbled through a responsive reading.  Then, after explaining the service’s new format, Reverend Q announced he was planning a new fitness program.  At first, it was called “Jumping for Jesus.”  Now it would be called “Exercising with Jesus.”  He said he would start with his own body.  At five-foot-ten and a weight of around 160, Reverend Q did not really look like someone who should be losing weight.  Some once said he could stand a few more pounds.  It was not clear if that was to have been taken as a joke.  But if it hurt Reverend Q’s feelings, he never took on about it, nor did anyone ever know.  Then Reverend Q announced that he got to see Jim, Todd, Candi, Paulina, Sydney and April Lynn perform on TV, and he said they did great.  Everyone else saw them as well, and they all agreed with Reverend Q.

After he made those announcements, the congregation sang one more hymn (known as the Offertory).  Then, after the collection was taken, the Salem Church Youth Ensemble took the stage.  They sang two songs.  One was called “Listening For My Name,” which was a song they sang just months ago at those churches in North Myrtle Beach and in the North Carolina mountains.  The other was one they never did, a song titled “Take the Name of Jesus With You.”  The ensemble seemed to be in good spirits, and the singing seemed to have a nice mellowness to it.  Everyone agreed the ensemble did quite well. 

After the ensemble sang, Reverend Q took the pulpit and said, “I am pleased to announce we have a special speaker this morning.”

There was something Reverend Q kept a secret until this morning.  Days earlier, Julie admitted to Reverend Q that she wanted to be a preacher when she got older.  Now, at only twelve years old, Julie was about to get her chance.  Maybe this chance could give Julie the experience she just may need.

Julie took the pulpit.  It looked as though she was prepared.  After Julie delivered a prayer, she opened her Bible.  She just read a few Bible verses.  She told everyone what each verse meant to her.  She also delivered her testimony.  She told everyone about her plans to study to be a preacher when she got older. 

Julie took a few minutes to tell everyone about the promise she and the others made to be friends for life, no matter what.  She credited Jim for coming up with that promise.  Julie said a promise is a promise, and it should be kept, no matter what.  Everyone agreed. 

Everyone seemed quite pleased with Julie’s preaching.  Autumn told Julie she would probably have a good future if she stayed on the path she was currently taking.  Jim told Julie she did very well and that he was pleased with her plans for the future.  Marissa told Julie it was one of the best services she ever attended done by a guest preacher.  Reverend Q told Julie she could preach again at another “Youth Sunday” if she chose to do so.

After church, Jim stopped to speak to Candi.  Candi told Jim she and Trisha and Cecilia were going to see a friend of theirs, who was in a nursing home after suffering a stroke.  Trisha showed up at the church in her big red Plymouth.  Cecilia was in the passenger seat.  Jim walked Candi to the car.  He opened the back door for her.  He gave her a kiss and told her he would speak to her later.

Jim walked back to his house.  When he got there, he saw Wendy’s car was in the driveway.  Wendy drove a red station wagon, a Volvo.  Jim went into the house.  Wendy asked him, “How was church?”

“It was pretty good.  You missed one heck of a service.  We sang, and Julie delivered a sermon.”

Wendy looked at Jim and said, “I know today was ‘Youth Sunday.’  And I also know Julie’s only twelve years old.  I’ll bet her sermon was quite interesting.”

“It was.  Julie said she wants to be a preacher when she gets older.”

“Julie’s like everyone else, I’m sure.  You can do anything if you set your mind to it.”

Then Jim said, “Reverend Q’s still wanting to start an exercise program.  He changed the name.”

“What’s it called now?” Wendy asked Jim.

“Exercising with Jesus.”

“I guess that sounds better.”

Then Jim asked Wendy, “Did you work long today?”

“About three hours.  This project wasn’t as major as we thought it would be.”

“That’s good,” Jim said.

Then Wendy said, “I’m going to hang out with some friends of mine from the produce plant.”

“Okay, Mom.  I might watch a movie on TV, or maybe a football game.”

Jim started to go upstairs to change out of his church clothes.  Before he could start up the stairs, Wendy said to him, “Jim, after I left work, I stopped by Winn-Dixie to pick up some feminine stuff.  I also picked up a chef’s salad from the deli.  I thought you might like it.  It’s on the table.”

Jim walked into the dining room.  Sure enough, there was a chef’s salad on the table.  There was also a bag of potato chips on the table.  Sour cream and onion.  One of Jim’s favorites.  Wendy said, “I figured you didn’t want to fix anything.”

“Thanks, Mom.  It looks good.  I’ll enjoy it.”

Jim started to go upstairs.  Wendy stopped him and said, “Jim, I did get a call at work.  Bob, Roseanna and Annabella were in a nasty car wreck yesterday.  Bob and Roseanna were not too badly hurt, but Annabella was pretty banged up.  She’ll be okay.”

Wendy was referring to Uncle Bob Claiborne, her brother, who ran the fishing pier in Myrtle Beach.  Roseanna was his wife.  Roseanna rarely left the Myrtle Beach area.  The last time Roseanna was at the Faulkner house was about five years earlier to visit with some distant relatives of hers.  Annabella was their teenage daughter, about a couple years younger than Jim.  Bob and Roseanna also had a son named Bobby (real name, Bob Claiborne, Jr.).  Bobby was about as old as Candi.  Bobby was now living in Conway, South Carolina, not far from Myrtle Beach.  He was now attending college in Conway and working at a Food Lion.  Bobby and Annabella visited with Wendy and Jim about once a year, and Bob usually brought them. 

“I hope they turn out okay,” Jim said.

Wendy said, “I’m sure they will.”

Jim went upstairs to change.  He knew he had not seen Roseanna, Bobby and Annabella in so long.  He knew how good it would be to see them again. 

Jim changed into a pair of “Army Pants” (which seemed to have been a fad in the mid-eighties), and he also put on a plain blue sweatshirt.  He knew it was starting to get a little colder outside.  Jim liked to dress comfortably, no matter what.  Jim wore blue jeans only until the seventh grade.  After that, he began to get uncomfortable in jeans.  Halfway through his seventh-grade year, Jim left jeans and switched to more comfortable pants.  Jim began wearing slacks and casual pants.  He also wore sweatpants around the house.  Wendy was okay with Jim’s choice in clothing.  She said if those kinds of clothes made him feel comfortable, then so be it.  She always said, “If you’re not comfortable, you’re not a happy person.”  Jim agreed with that.

Jim returned to the living room.  Wendy was about to leave.  The doorbell rang.  Cooley Benfield stepped in with his wife and a few others from the produce plant.  Cooley had a small bag in his hand.  He said, “Hi, Jim.  I got something for you and your mother.  I got you some oranges and I figured you two might like them.”

“Thanks, Cooley.  I do love oranges.”

There were four oranges in the bag.  Jim took one orange out, and he put the other three in the refrigerator.  Before they left, Wendy said, “Jim, we’re getting ready to go.  Are you okay staying here by yourself?”

“Yes, Mom.  I’ll watch some TV and enjoy the salad you got me.”

Then Wendy asked Jim, “Is Candi coming over while I’m gone?”

“I’m not sure.  She and Trisha and Cecilia are going to see a friend of theirs in a nursing home.”

Then Cooley asked, “Jim, who’s this Candi?”

“Cooley, Candi Robertson is my girlfriend.  And she is very pretty.”

“I’m sure she is, Jim.  Don’t rush into anything,” Cooley said.

“Cooley, I’m not.  But we’re already going steady.”

Cooley said, “Jim, I’m sure that’s okay.”

Then Jim asked, “So where are you all planning to go this beautiful but cool Sunday afternoon?”

Wendy answered, “Oh, we’re going to go to Southpark Mall.  We may do a little shopping, and then maybe eat at Morrison’s Cafeteria.”

“That sounds good.  I can see you all have a fun afternoon planned,” Jim said.

Wendy asked Jim, “Is there anything I can get you while we’re at the mall?”

“No thanks, Mom.  You all just be careful, have fun and enjoy yourselves.”

They all stepped outside.  Wendy quickly stepped back inside and said, “Boy, it sure is getting a little chilly outside.  I guess I better get myself a sweater.”

Jim said, “Please do, Mom.  You get sick and I’m up the river.”

Wendy grabbed a sweater.  Then she stepped back outside and joined the others.  It really was getting a little chilly.  And it was about the middle of November.  Before long, winter would set in and it would really be cold.  Jim saw Wendy out the door.  He said to those on the front porch, “You all be careful and have fun and enjoy your afternoon.  And don’t worry about me.  I will be fine.”

Jim watched as everyone got into Wendy’s station wagon.  After Wendy drove away from the house, Jim stepped back inside and closed the door.  He locked both the door lock and the deadbolt lock (he always did that when he was alone).  Jim put some salad dressing on his chef’s salad.  This time, he would do blue cheese.  After Jim found out there were other salad dressings besides thousand island (which was what he ate when he ate salads as a child), he would become “adventurous” and try other salad dressings such as blue cheese, French, Good Seasons Italian, Kraft Catalina and Hidden Valley Ranch.  He would like them as he tried them.

Jim got him a can of Coke.  Then he went into the living room.  He put his food on a small table situated at the front window.  Before he ate, Jim looked out the front window.  He smiled as he saw some of his friends hanging out together.  Jim ate his salad and some of his sour cream and onion potato chips.  Jim turned on the TV and he watched the last of a televised church service on Channel 9.  When the service ended, Jim took his disposable salad bowl and put it in the trash.  Then he put the bag of potato chips in one of the kitchen cabinets, and he got him another can of Coke.

Jim returned to the living room.  He felt he was getting a little chilly so he went to a closet and got him a soft white blanket.  Jim sat down and wrapped the blanket around him.  Jim saw the opening of a movie program on Channel 9.  It opened with a song from a jazz group called Spyro Gyra.  Jim heard the song on the radio a few days ago.  He did not remember the name of the song, but he liked it and it sounded good.  Then, a movie started.  It was a movie called “Shenandoah” (it starred James Stewart as a widowed father who, along with his children, was trying not to get involved with the Civil War).  After a few minutes, Jim decided he had enough of the movie and decided to change the TV to Channel 36.  A football game was about to start.  It was the Houston Oilers versus the Kansas City Chiefs.  Jim thought it would probably be a good game.

The game started.  Jim started to feel a little warmer thanks to that blanket.  About halfway through the first quarter, Jim began to feel a little sleepy.  He napped for about an hour.  Jim woke to two commercials, Firestone and then Michelob.   Jim looked out the front window again.  He saw Trisha’s red 1967 Plymouth going toward the Cavanaugh house.  Jim also saw Marissa walking into the house by way of her crutches.  Some of the kids were around her.  Jim wondered what was going on.  He could not figure it out.  Jim closed the curtain and watched some more of the football game. 

About an hour later, Jim heard the doorbell ring several times.  Jim threw the blanket off him and threw it over the back of the recliner he was sitting in.  Then he sluggishly got up.  He walked to the front door just as slow and he mumbled, “Yeah, yeah, okay.  I’m coming, I’m coming.”

Jim walked to the front door and looked out the peephole.  He saw Julie, and she had Audrey, Mark, Candi and Sydney with her.  Jim opened the door and let them in.  Right away, Candi gave Jim a kiss on the cheek.  She was still wearing the same suit she was wearing in church. 

Audrey said to Jim, “We’re having a party at the Cavanaugh house and we figured you might want to join us.”

“What kind of party?” Jim asked.

Mark answered, “A birthday party.”

“Whose birthday is it?” Jim asked.

Sydney answered, “Today is Mom’s birthday.”

Then it hit Jim.  He said, “Oh.  I forgot.  Today is Autumn’s birthday.  She mentioned it at church this morning.”

Julie was still wearing the same black turtleneck sweater and black skirt she wore at church.  She said, “Jim, we want to know if you would be willing to join us.”

Jim said, “Yes.  I suppose I could join you all.”

At that moment, the phone rang.  Jim said, “Hold on.  I have to answer that.”

Jim went into the kitchen to answer the phone.  After he said “Hello,” Jim recognized the voice on the other end.  His mother.  “Hi, Jim.  I just wanted to call and see how things are going at home.”

Jim said, “I’m okay.  I was watching a football game and I took a nap for about an hour.  Audrey is here, and she brought Julie, Mark, Sydney and Candi with her.”

“Really?  Any reason why they came over?”

“They told me they are holding a birthday party for Autumn and they invited me over.”

“Is today Autumn’s birthday?”

“Yes, Mom.”

Then Wendy said, “Oh, dear.  We’re at Southpark Mall.  I’m on a pay phone.  Good thing I’m standing near Woolworth and Eckerd’s.  I guess I better find Autumn a birthday gift.  I might get her a card also while I’m at it.”

“Any idea what you might get her?” Jim asked.

“I don’t know.  Something simple and inexpensive, I guess.  I’ll look around Woolworth and maybe Eckerd’s, too.”

Wendy knew that today was Autumn’s birthday, but somehow it slipped her mind.  Wendy did promise Autumn she would get her a gift for her birthday, and she made that same promise to herself.  *A promise is a promise*. 

“Mom, I’m going to the birthday party as soon as I get changed.”

“Okay, Jim.  I may stop by her house after I get done here.”

“Okay, Mom.  I’ll talk to you later.”

Jim told those in the living room he would join them as soon as he changed clothes.  Jim changed into a polo shirt and a pair of casual pants.  As soon as he got back into the living room, he saw Julie watching the football game.  She said, “Houston Oilers and Kansas City Chiefs?  That sounds rather lame.”

“It’s still a good game,” Jim said.

Jim turned the TV off.  They walked out the front door.  On the way to the Cavanaugh house, Audrey said, “Jim, I heard your uncle and his wife and daughter were in a bad car accident.  I hope they’re okay.”

“They seem to be from what Mom said.  Uncle Bob and Aunt Roseanna were not really hurt.  My cousin Annabella’s pretty banged up, but she should be okay.”

Audrey said, “That’s good news, Jim.  I like your Uncle Bob.  I haven’t seen Roseanna and your cousins in some time.”

“Bob comes by about once or twice a year.  Roseanna, Annabella and Bobby don’t leave the Myrtle Beach area very much.  In fact, Bobby’s in college now.”

Then Audrey shifted to another subject.  “What did your mother have to say?”

Jim answered, “She went to Southpark Mall with some friends of hers from the produce plant.  She called me from a pay phone.  She seemed to have forgotten about Autumn’s birthday.  Mom’s gonna get something for Autumn.”

“That’s nice,” Julie said.

Sydney asked, “Did your mother say anything about coming over to our house?”

Jim answered, “Mom said she probably would.”

Before they got to the Cavanaugh house, Audrey said, “Jim, Candi and Sydney, we saw you all on TV this morning.  You all did great.”

Jim, Candi and Sydney all said, “Thanks, Audrey.”

They arrived at the Cavanaugh house.  Jim got a look at the table.  There was a birthday cake, a bowl full of potato chips, and a vegetable tray from a supermarket deli.  Everything looked very nice.

Jim asked Alex where Autumn was.  Alex said, “Luke took Mom out riding around Charlotte after they got home from church.  We told Luke to keep Mom out at least an hour.  They should be back any minute.”

Then Jim said, “Alex, everything looks nice.  I know Autumn will be pleased.”

About fifteen minutes later, Luke pulled his Scout Traveler into the driveway.  Jim got a look out the front window.  Autumn was riding in the passenger seat.  Luke and Autumn got out of the Scout.  They walked into the house.  Autumn was surprised by what she saw.  The candles on the cake were lit.  Everyone sang “Happy Birthday” to her.  Autumn blew out the candles.  After that, everyone helped themselves to the food.  Autumn asked Jim, “Where’s that mother of yours?”

“Mom’s out with some friends of hers from the produce plant.  I spoke to her a while ago.  She said she might be over later.”

“I sure do hope so.”

“She’s at Southpark Mall.  She did say she would be here later.”

It seemed like everyone was enjoying themselves.  Mark and Simon got some of them into the living room to watch the last of a football game, the same one Jim was watching.  Jim got himself some vegetables and potato chips.  Right away, Jim knew the potato chips had a different taste from the Lay’s Potato Chips he was very familiar with.  Then Pam Gilmore told him.  “Jim, those aren’t Lay’s.  Those are Wise.  There was a special on them at the Winn-Dixie, so I got them.”

Wise Potato Chips.  Jim knew the brand well.  He also remembered another brand of potato chips.  Charles Chips.  When Jim was just a child, he remembered the Charles Chips truck making regular deliveries to the neighborhood.  Jim shared a story with everyone at the party.  He remembered when the Charles Chips truck stopped at his house not long after his parents divorced.  Wendy would order big cans of Charles Chips.  Jim always enjoyed the visits.  The man from Charles Chips also visited the Holbrook house, and the Cavanaugh family’s former house.  The visits continued until not long after April Lynn was born.  After that, anyone who wanted potato chips ended up having to go to a grocery store.

As usual, Jim and Candi pretty much stayed together.  Everyone thought what a cute couple they were.  And why not?  Jim and Candi had been together for the last eleven months.  Many other girls had a crush on Jim, especially Julie and April Lynn and Sydney, just to name a few.  To Jim, they were good friends.  They were just that…friends.  Everyone was happy for Jim and Candi.

Jim and Candi sat at the table with Autumn and some of the others.  Ice cream was now being served.  Vanilla ice cream.  One of Jim’s favorites.  Some may have thought it was a little too cold for ice cream, seeing it was almost the middle of November, a few days before Thanksgiving.  But it didn’t seem to matter.  Everyone enjoyed it. 

Everyone was still there as afternoon turned into evening.  Wendy finally showed up around six o’ clock.  She did get Autumn a present.  Autumn opened her gift from Wendy.  It was a bottle of perfume.  Autumn squirted some of it in the air.  Jim got a whiff of it.  It smelled really nice.  Autumn thanked Wendy.  Wendy said, “Happy Birthday, Autumn.  I wish I could have done better.”

Autumn said, “Thank you, Wendy.  You could have not done better if you tried.”

Then Wendy said, “Jim, that’s from you also.  I hope you don’t mind.”

“Mom, it’s okay with me as far as I’m concerned.  Happy Birthday, Autumn,”

Autumn hugged both Jim and Wendy.  Then Autumn thanked everyone for the gifts, and she also thanked everyone for showing up for her birthday party. 

Nearly everyone stayed about another couple hours.  There was another football game on the big TV in the living room, this time on Channel 3.  The Los Angeles Rams versus the Chicago Bears.  Autumn turned the TV all the way down, turned on the stereo, and she played some top 40 music.  Those who stayed enjoyed some more food.  Candi stayed at the party, but Trisha and Cecilia left.  The Holbrook, Marlowe, Barrett and Gilmore families and the Crabtree kids also stayed, but everyone else left.  Jim and Wendy stayed.  Ariel and Jodi Cattrall also stayed (Charmaine had a cold and stayed home).  Simon Cavanaugh was happy Ariel stayed because she was his girlfriend.  Kendra Braddock, Mark Cavanaugh’s girlfriend, also stayed.  Kendra’s mother, Siobhan Braddock, stayed at the party as well.  Siobhan was about the same age as some of the mothers.  Siobhan lost her husband to a heart attack when Kendra was only six years old (Kendra was an only child).  Despite that, Siobhan was still friendly, sweet, and full of energy, just like Autumn and Charmaine.  Charmaine also lost her husband to a heart attack. 

Siobhan seemed to have a taste for classic rock.  She was excited when she heard a classic rock song on the radio.  The name of the group was Sniff ‘n the Tears, and the song was called “Driver’s Seat.”  Everyone seemed to like it.  To Jim, it was a song he had not heard before. 

Siobhan also seemed to like classic Chrysler Corporation cars.  She drove a blue 1964 Chrysler.  At the party, Siobhan recalled her first car, a 1961 Dodge. 

The party ended around eight o’ clock.  Wendy and Jim walked home.  Jim was very tired and decided to just change his clothes and go straight to bed.

 

😊

 

Salem Church held its annual Christmas program the Sunday before Christmas.  The Salem Church Youth Ensemble held its first ever Christmas concert.  The ensemble sang a collection of Christmas songs.  Some were Christmas carols, and there was also a collection of children’s Christmas songs such as “Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer” and “Frosty the Snowman” and “Up on the Housetop.” 

After the concert, there was the traditional Christmas play.  Luke was asked to read the Christmas story from the Bible.  Jim played Joseph, and Candi played Mary.  Mark, Simon and Malachi played the Wise Men.  After the play, the church served desserts and sodas and iced tea.

Christmas seemed to have been pretty nice.  Jim got a boom box and a racetrack.  Dinner was served at the Faulkner house.  Wendy let Jim help with Christmas dinner.  Jim baked the ham and made the salad and baked biscuits.  Wendy also allowed Jim to make a pie, a cherry cheese pie, another one of Jim’s favorites.  The Holbrook, Cavanaugh, Barrett, Crabtree and Marlowe families were in attendance.  Candi was also there, along with Ariel and Jodi. 

Candi gave Jim a Christmas present.  It was a framed photo of him and her together on that trip to the mountains.  It was one Julie took at that house in Lansing.  It turned out pretty good.  Jim put the picture on his nightstand.  It would give him something to enjoy.

The rest of 1984 went by.  Jim thought a lot about the past year.  Everything from meeting Candi and the trips that summer, to that Christmas.  He thought a lot about what the year meant.  He knew that the years to come would have just as much meaning to him and his friends and family.",1,1767185214.0,u_jim21869,0,1.0,False

1q0c4tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1q0c4tu/starting_a_micro_roastery_business_in_a_small/,Starting a Micro Roastery Business in a Small European Town,"I’m originally from a small European country, and I’ve been living abroad for several years now (about 4 years in Italy and 3 years in the U.S. where I’ve worked in numerous coffee shops). Over the past year, I’ve been seriously considering moving back home to start a small specialty coffee project in my hometown.

The idea is to open a  two-level operation project. The ground floor would function as a coffee shop which will have day-to-day revenue, while the first floor would be dedicated to coffee roasting. The main goal of the roasting side would be to supply specialty coffee within the state of my home town as it’s a very small region with a surprisingly high number of coffee shops and no specialty coffee roasters at all (everything currently available is commercial coffee).

For the first year, I want to keep things simple and manageable. My plan is to focus on roasting and packaging just two coffees, one designed for local businesses (cafés and restaurants) and one aimed at home coffee drinkers. The coffee shop itself would also serve as a showcase for the roasted coffee and help support the business financially while the roasting side grows.

My background is primarily working as a barista rather than roasting. That said, I do have a basic understanding of roasting principles and overall workflow, and I’ve been actively researching equipment and production setups. One roaster that caught my attention is the [TKM-SX 10](https://www.toper.com/en/products/coffee-shop-roasters-tkm-sx-10/) as it seems relatively affordable and realistic for starting small without scaling too fast.

For those of you who roast professionally or have started a similar project, does this sound like a reasonable first setup? Is a roaster like the TKM-SX 10 a good place to start? And more generally, what advice would you give to someone transitioning from bar work into roasting?

Für den ein oder anderen mag das Ganze jetzt wie Arbeit aussehen oder zwanghaft wirken. Nachdem ich aber mal die Zeit überschlagen habe, die ich für meinen Pile of Shame in der Theorie benötige, war es mir wichtig, bewusster Spiele zu konsumieren und nicht mehr auf Vorrat zu kaufen.

1q0c2m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Superb-Fox2596/comments/1q0c2m8/aliia_roza/,Aliia Roza,"# This is not my usual tax blog. I listened to the podcast below (The Shawn Ryan Show) and wanted to reflect on it a little.

  
Here is the full podcast that I just listened to. It’s long (about 3.5 hours), but once I started listening to it, I couldn’t stop because I couldn’t believe my ears that all this was happening in reality. *James Bond*\-style spy movies pale in comparison to this story.

# What is the story about?

Since 2020, a Russian citizen living in the US (Aliia Roza, which is not her real name, of course) has been studying in a special program in Russia that trains people to infiltrate the beds of leading government officials, criminal groups, or business representatives and obtain information in this way. G.k. Russia’s neighboring countries, etc. in Europe. [https://youtu.be/E4gLB7Qu0vk](https://youtu.be/E4gLB7Qu0vk)

# What does this have to do with taxes?

Just a side note - one interesting aspect of the whole story was about the Russian criminal group she had infiltrated. There was also a special rule that each gang member had to share with the whole group for their common needs. If I heard correctly, it was 10%. They called it a common pot or something like that. (обшаг). So even groups like this understand that without a common pot, they cannot survive. Why would anyone (for example, the electricians who recently helped me at home and asked for payment (not a small amount - EUR 500) only in cash and without paperwork) still doubt that our society also needs a ‘common pot’? Why do criminals pay that 10%? Because they need the protection of the group and there will be serious consequences for not paying. Obviously, the electrician does not feel the need for ‘protection’ and is used to ‘free’ emergency services or schools, but most importantly, there are no consequences.

# But that’s not what this story is about

I was very hesitant about writing this at all. Many major media outlets, such as [*The Times*](https://www.thetimes.com/us/american-politics/article/silicon-valley-spy-china-russia-2v03676kl), [*The NY Post*](https://nypost.com/2025/10/28/business/russian-honeypot-reveals-how-putins-sex-spies-seduce-silicon-valley-nerds/), and others, have also written about this. However, in the current geopolitical situation, it seemed important to spread this story, because it left a bad taste in my mouth—what kind of country is this next door to us, where such people are trained at the state level?

Not to mention the twisted thinking of people who (like Aliia Roza’s father) willingly support such a military system and even involve their daughters in it, knowing that they will be raped there and that people are being trained there. Aliia Roza herself said that about 10% of women participate in these military spy training courses and that they are all “trained” in this way. She herself willingly continues her ‘training’ there, even after realizing what awaits her both during her ‘training’ and after its completion.

At least from what she herself said, it was clear that she is intelligent and has always been a good student, which means that the whole world was open to her—she could have pursued any ‘normal’ profession. I was simply shocked (perhaps I am too naive). Some kind of evil empire, a world comparable to the dark mirror world of the Stranger Things series (today, by the way, the latest and final episode of this series is being released).

# Methods

To begin ‘processing’ their target, they observe the person for about three months and research all the information available about them. Right down to the number of sugar spoons in their coffee. They even go and talk to the target’s teachers and other possible sources of information. She even mentioned a website where, for a few dollars, much of this information is already available in summary form. Some of the techniques—involving rehearsed scenes that the “target” sees on a daily basis—sounded really creative. However, much of what was said and seemed ‘revolutionary’ also seemed rather primitive.

# What is said must be filtered

Of course, much of what is said must be filtered - who said it and why. She presents it as a way to draw attention to herself in order to stop the Russian special services from asking her to continue performing various intelligence tasks. However, has her confused mind suddenly become loyal to the values of democratic countries (which I hope we are also striving for)? I don’t believe that for a moment.

# Rhetorical question

On the [*Quora* ](https://www.quora.com/)portal, I occasionally come across photos from World War II concentration camps. As far as I can tell, [for example, from this podcast](https://youtu.be/ojOjHG86IRw?si=OZGJv7aq-CYjSrOV) (be careful with this one, because the co-author of the [podcast ](https://open.spotify.com/show/0EshU9K5GhVfOFBqWW11dL?si=0165ff3b2fed46e3)[*To Die For*](https://open.spotify.com/show/0EshU9K5GhVfOFBqWW11dL?si=0165ff3b2fed46e3) is Aliia Roza herself), this (bed) method has also been used in Israel and elsewhere. And I still can’t understand how people can be so cruel to each other. Maybe that’s why it’s worth paying taxes to reduce the possibility of something like that happening here?

I wanted to be able to not only slow down video/audio and change pitch - lots of apps do that - and not only did I want to be able to set loops - some apps do that as well - I wanted a way to save those loops so that I could jump right into that practice anytime I wanted. No need to chase down the file and set the loop again.

I wanted to set up that loop as a drill and schedule it for the next week, for example - ""I'm working on this solo, each day set this drill up to play, starting at 90% and getting 2% faster each day"".

I wanted a way to practice fretboard knowledge and intervals - the app listens to what I'm playing and keeps score of how many I get right in a minute, etc.

I wanted metronome practice that I could have progressions (ie, get 1% faster every X measures). Metronome practice with beat dropouts - ie, can you keep time even when the metronome doesn't click every beat?

I wanted stats to nerd out over. Badges and motivational quotes. A repertoire page to keep on top of my band's set lists.

The vast majority of this app is built with Claude Code. I did have an experienced infosec guy review things just to make sure all was kosher on the security / authentication front. This app is live and has a few dozen users. It's completely free (I do have a ""Buy Me a Coffee"" link). I use it every day that I have access to a guitar - it's bloody amazing.

I was on Day 471 of posting daily on LinkedIn. Sounds impressive, right?

Here's what nobody saw: I'd spent the last 90 minutes rewriting the same post. Seven different versions. Each one felt... wrong.

Not terrible. Just mediocre. And mediocre on LinkedIn is invisible.

I finally published version #4 out of exhaustion. Woke up to 23 likes. Half were bots. The other half were probably people who liked it by accident while scrolling.

**That's when it hit me.**

I'd been doing this for 471 days. I should be *better* at this by now. But every single night felt like the first time. The same anxiety. The same second-guessing. The same ""is this good enough?"" spiral.

# The Problem Nobody Talks About

Everyone tells you to ""be consistent on LinkedIn.""

Post daily. Build authority. Provide value. Be authentic.

Cool. But here's what they don't tell you:

**The gap between writing a post and writing a post that actually lands is invisible to you when you're staring at your own words.**

You read your draft. It makes sense to you. But you wrote it, so of course it does.

You have no idea if:

* The hook will make someone stop scrolling
* The middle part rambles or flows
* The ending inspires action or just... ends
* Your ""unique insight"" sounds like everyone else's unique insight

So you publish and pray. Some posts hit. Most don't. You never really know why.

# The Moment Everything Changed

Day 683. I'm sitting with my co-founder at a coffee shop.

He asks, ""How long did your post take today?""

""About 40 minutes,"" I say.

""How much of that was writing?""

""Maybe 10 minutes.""

""And the other 30?""

""...Staring at it. Wondering if it's good.""

He laughs. ""What if you could just... ask something? Like, 'Hey, is this hook strong enough?' and get an instant answer?""

I stared at him.

That was it. That was the tool I'd been wishing existed for 683 days.

# Building My Own Truth Mirror

I didn't want another AI writing assistant that generates posts for you.

I wanted something that would read *my* writing and tell me the truth. Brutally. Specifically. Usefully.

So we started building.

**Week 1:** I fed it 200+ of my own posts. Winners and losers. I labeled what worked and what flopped.

**Week 2:** We analyzed patterns. Emotional hooks, structural rhythm, clarity, call-to-actions that actually converted vs. ones that died.

**Week 3:** The first prototype roasted one of my posts so accurately I laughed out loud in a quiet library. It called out my vague opening line, pointed out where I lost the thread, and flagged my ""reach out to learn more"" ending as ""lazy and forgettable.""

It was perfect.

# What [postautopsy](http://postautopsy.com/) Actually Does (The Real Features)

Think of it as your brutally honest editor who's read 10,000 LinkedIn posts and knows exactly what works.

**Before you hit publish, it shows you:**

**1. Hook Strength Analysis** Your opening line gets scored. ""I'm excited to announce"" = instant fail. ""Day 683: I stared at a blank post for 47 minutes"" = now we're talking.

**2. Story Structure Check** Are you rambling? Jumping around? Losing focus halfway through? It maps your narrative arc and shows you where readers will drop off.

**3. Clarity Scanner** Flags corporate jargon, vague statements, and confusing sentences. Suggests sharper alternatives. No more ""leveraging synergies"" garbage.

**4. Engagement Prediction** Based on patterns from high-performing posts, it predicts whether your post will resonate or disappear into the void.

**5. The Roast (My Favorite Feature)** Sometimes you need to hear the truth. ""This post is 8 paragraphs of setup for a point you could've made in 2 sentences."" Harsh. Accurate. Necessary.

**6. Instant Rewrites** Doesn't just criticize shows you how to fix weak sections with examples. It's like having a co-writer who's already seen what works.

# The Result?

 - Which exact parts come into contact with hot water/steam (e.g., is the lid silicone, PP, or steel?).
 - What those parts are specifically made of (grading).
 - Whether third-party migration testing reports are available publicly.

It feels odd. We worry about microplastics and leaching, yet specific material breakdown is rarely on the product page.

Is this because the supply chain is too fragmented for brands to track, or is it a deliberate lack of transparency to hide cost-cutting measures?

I’m a 28-year-old Portuguese guy and she’s a 30-year-old Peruvian woman who has been living in Italy for about 5 years.
We talked for around 4 months every day before meeting — calls, messages, voice notes, just a little bit every day. We finally decided to meet in person for the first time and travel together during Christmas.
We met in Paris, went to Disneyland, explored the city, and even went to Mont-Saint-Michel, which was something we both really wanted to visit. Overall, the trip felt genuinely good to me.
There was physical contact, always respectful. I initiated some, but she also did. For example:
– holding my hand while I was driving
– touching my chest while asking questions about me
– sitting close, relaxed body language
After one evening when I went back to my hotel room, I gave her a kiss on the head when we said good night. She didn’t pull away or react negatively.
During the drive to Spain, while she was holding my hand, I also gave her a kiss on the hand, and again there was no awkwardness or rejection.
I was attentive but not over the top: opening the car door for her (she always thanked me), checking if she was okay, being present. One night I went to her hotel room just to talk and help her with some things on her phone — we ended up watching videos together and laughing a lot. Nothing sexual, just comfortable.
On the last day, I had to go to Portugal and she wanted to go to Spain to meet her best friend. I offered to drive her from Paris to Spain so she could stay with her friend. The whole drive was filled with conversation — no awkward silences, no strange moments at all.
When we arrived in Spain, I was exhausted and sick with the flu, high fever and all. I ended up renting a room in the same hotel where she and her friend were staying. She actually took care of me — went to get me medicine and food. That meant a lot to me.
The next morning, when I was feeling a bit better, I called her to my room to give her some of her things. She asked when we would see each other again and if I’d like to travel with her again in 2026. I said yes and felt genuinely happy that she brought it up.
Important detail:
I didn’t “buy” her affection. I paid for a coffee here, a dinner there, and gave her a small plush toy at Disneyland. She also paid for things — including tolls on the drive to Madrid. It felt balanced.
And yet…
I still feel like she’s not really interested in me.
That’s what’s messing with my head.
When I fall for someone, my mind goes into overdrive. Some days my self-esteem is fine, other days it crashes completely and my brain feeds me the worst possible thoughts. I overthink everything. I feel deeply, maybe too deeply.
Objectively, when I look at the facts, it seems like things went well.
Emotionally, I keep thinking: “If she was really interested, I’d feel it more clearly.”
So my question is:
Am I overthinking this?
Or am I missing some obvious sign that she only sees me as a friend?

So for men i reccomend putting your finger in your ass style and im not recommending gay sex here. Im reccomending just lightly pulling on the walls of your anal hole in a certain direction while trying to push.

While it shares similar traits with anal i reccomend it for anyone constipated and have no other way to go.

Do all this in one hour. For me eating the prunes takes 45 mins as it also needs to digest. Drink 1 litre in 15 minutes. Lastly the shit takes ONLY 5 mins. After this drink two servings of coffee and boom a little bit of diarrhoea but it works.

Eating food after that may make u shit too depending on what.

Also check how many grams of prunes or apircots you need depending on how many calories you eat. I eat 1750 calories so i eat around 150g of prunes a day.

Lastly theres a timing for it. If you eat at a lot at 12 noon and lets say a little bit at 6 pm, take the prunes the next day 12 noon and continue the process.

1q0bvfn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0bvfn,Technique question,My wife is building a new skirt and legs for an old coffee table for her mother as a Christmas gift. The catch is that she is making it match a 100 year-old set of end tables with a particular design. I have included a picture of the original table and my wife’s initial effort to replicate the design on that table. Would a router of some type be able to do these marks or would this be more of a wood carving gouge? The second picture is of my wife’s first try using a Dremel tool Any advice is welcome.

I'll be brutally honest: it's 100% a Ponzi scheme. There's no ""artificial intelligence"" behind it; it's a classic pyramid scheme.
However, as often happens with these things, while the show lasts, the payments will come.
Here's the current situation:
• How it works: Just one click a day (""Quantify"") unlocks profits.
• Insane ROI: It gives 30% a day. Example: VIP1 costs 10 USDT and gives you 3 USDT back immediately every day.
• Withdrawals: I've tested the withdrawal process, and so far, the money arrives immediately (you can only withdraw your earnings, not your locked-up capital).
• Risk: Extremely high. It could shut down in an hour or a month.
I'm in it just to see how long it lasts and take home some USDT while the tap is open. If you're a degen and want to risk your coffee money (knowing you could lose it tomorrow morning), the system is paying off.

**Location:** A strictly non-smoking, climate-controlled IRC channel (since physical rooms have ""variable humidity"" which is unacceptable).
**Attendance:** 12 (though member 0x07 argued that ""attendance"" is an abstract factory pattern and cannot be quantified by a simple integer).

---

### 1. Old Business: The ""Tabs vs. Spaces"" Fatality

The meeting opened with a moment of silence for former member Kevin, who was summarily deleted from the roster last week. Kevin’s crime was not merely using spaces, but using **three** spaces.

The committee agreed that while the ""Tabs vs. Spaces"" war is a foundational binary, the use of a prime number of spaces is a clear sign of psychological instability and a violation of the ""Even Number Cleanliness"" protocol.

### 2. Discussion: Variable Naming Conventions

Member `_ptr_Final_Final_v2` raised a motion to ban the use of the variable `i` in loops.

> ""It lacks semantic density,"" he argued, adjusting his blue-light glasses. ""If you are iterating through an array of artisanally sourced coffee beans, the iterator should be named `current_Index_Of_Single_Origin_Roasted_Arabica_Entity`. Anything less is essentially prose, and we are not poets; we are architects of logic.""

The motion passed, though the documentation for this change will take six months to write because the club cannot agree on the font-weight of the header.

### 3. The ""Hello World"" Code Review

The club spent four hours reviewing a junior applicant’s ""Hello World"" script. The applicant used:
`print(""Hello, World!"")`

The consensus was a unanimous **Reject**. The critique included:

* **Lack of Scalability:** ""What if we need to say hello to the Moon later? There is no 'CelestialBody' interface.""
* **Hardcoded Strings:** ""String literals are a security vulnerability of the soul.""
* **Missing Dependencies:** The script failed to include a logging framework, a telemetry layer, and a 12-page README.md explaining the historical etymology of the word ""Hello.""

### 4. New Business: The Coffee Machine API

The club’s breakroom coffee machine remains broken because the members refused to press the ""Start"" button. They are currently embroiled in a debate over whether the button is an **Input Trigger** or a **State Transition Request**. Until the manufacturer provides a formal GraphQL schema for the ""Espresso"" mutation, the club will remain dehydrated.

---

### 5. Adjournment

The meeting was scheduled to end at 9:00 PM. However, at 8:59 PM, a member pointed out that the wall clock was off by 400 milliseconds due to network jitter.

The club spent the next three hours discussing the philosophical implications of ""Objective Time"" versus ""Unix Epoch Time,"" eventually concluding that the meeting hadn't actually started yet because the `begin_meeting()` function hadn't been properly wrapped in a `try-catch` block.

Basically, there's a girl that works at the dispensary I frequent and every time I go there, no matter if I use the drive through or walk in or order ahead, she goes out of the way to make sure she is *always* the one who checks me out. We always end up chatting and joking with each other for a bit, she is always giving me free stuff and is VERY heavy on the eye contact. Normally I'd have no issue shooting my shot if I have even the slightest inkling that a girl might be interested  in me, but my two problems here are whether she is actually being flirty with me or I'm looking too much into it, and also if I do decide to ask her if she'd want to maybe get some coffee sometime, it feels wrong to ask her that while she is working, almost like I'm cornering her, and I don't want to put that kind of stress on her. Thoughts, opinions, comments or concerns?

Should also mention, we are about the same age (late 20s), both bigger people, and while I am not certain she is single, she has hinted she is, and I do know she isn't married.

My spontaneous-arousal count (in a lab that doesn't search for RERAs, but they really are RERAs and not spontaneous arousals) during my first sleep study was 313 in 7 hours and a half (44.7 index), and my RERA count in another sleep study (WatchPAT, an at-home one) was 172. I was also found to have complete tongue-base collapse during a DISE last summer. I'm currently sleeping with a custom-made MAD device and a positional belt, which help me feel a little less shitty, but they don't fix my problem (I also tried APAP optimized with OSCAR for a month and a half last year, with EPR = 3, and it did nothing for me). I use Ritalin and a lot of coffee to stay awake. I also underwent bilateral turbinate reduction with the same surgeon who performed my DISE. That surgeon told me to do tongue-focused myofunctional therapy, so I'll have to see if that helps.

I'm a college student and, even though I've had this for years and I've managed to take my life back and push through my degree (although I'll graduate 2 years later than my friends), I've had a rough time getting used to the idea that I just may never find ""the treatment/surgery/cure"" to fix my UARS, but I think it's the right mindset to have after many failed trials. I am relatively disciplined in my studying, or at least I try to be.

I don’t know what to do F18,"Before I start I’m gonna say please don’t judge me. I know I fucked up and my life is a mess and I am very aware of that. I don’t even know if this is the right sub so please remove my post if it isn’t

I F18 had a few weeks in October where I just lost the plot. I was meeting up with random older guys from Tinder for sex who were quite rough and I still have the bruises but I enjoyed it at the time and I was masturbating constantly even when it hurt and drinking every day and taking all sorts of drugs. I hardly slept too for that full time which I think just made things even worse. Like I’m not even joking I think I slept like 8 hours for the full 2 and a bit weeks or however long it was but I wasn’t even tired. Last time I felt like this I spent all my money trying to start this stupid beauty business even though everyone told me it was a dumb idea and I ended up making precisely $0. I’m still paying off my credit cards for that.

At the start of November I started feeling like shit and I’ve been so depressed. Ive not been going to college and have fell behind on all my work and have just been sleeping all day and barely eating. My job at a coffee shop fired me a few weeks ago and I don’t even care because I didn’t have the energy to go. I told my manager I was feeling depressed but she said that it wasn’t good enough and I do understand we are busy at this time of year. But I really am depressed. I actually can’t remember the last time I actually ate something and I’m definitely dehydrated af. Like my pee is dark orange but I don’t have the energy to get a bottle of water. My flatmate has brought me sandwiches and water but she’s with her parents now until college starts again in a few weeks

Now I just found out I’m pregnant and I don’t even know who the father is. I fucking hate myself. I ordered some tests online and they are all positive except 1 but I don’t think I peed on it properly. I think my period was last in October at the start but I can’t remember for sure. I can’t believe I’ve let this happen and I hate myself. I am disgusting. Have all the drugs and alcohol hurt the baby? I’m such a mess and have no idea what to do. My parents are going to kill me and I’m probably gonna get kicked out of college because I haven’t turned in my assignments. I feel really bad if I’ve fucked the baby up with all the drinking and I also smoked weed and did cocaine and speed and other stuff I can’t even remember. Is there any way to check? Should I go to the doctor? What if the baby is deformed because of what I did? I’m on my parents health insurance plan so they’ll probably find out.  I have fucked up bad and my parents will probably disown me. I just feel like I’m stuck and can’t get out. I don’t know why I keep making these stupid choices which I hate myself for after. Now I feel like I’m being watched but I don’t even know who by. Even when I’m in bed with the covers over my head I feel like people can see me. I have these horrible blisters on my hips and elbows which are just getting worse. Getting out of bed is the hardest thing ever. I don’t know why I’m like this. I just want to be normal like my friends. ",14,1767183511.0,Advice,37,0.82,False
