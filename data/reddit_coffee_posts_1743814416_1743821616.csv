1jrtnxt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrtnxt,My Orchids :),"hi all!!

I just started collecting orchids last year when I started working at a local grocery store. Every time I tried to keep them before, they were dead in weeks. For whatever reason I've figured it out. The store I work at normally only gets the moth orchids and gem orchids, occasionally gets the little mini ones, and I usually only rescue the rejects, the discounts, unless it's a special occasion.

The first beauty pictured was a treat to myself in October for getting employee of the month, and she bloomed fully by the first of November. So those blooms are 5 months old, with a new stem with buds popping out. I didn't know orchids could bloom for this long! 

The second one is my personal favorite, Colmanara Massai Red 'Splash' (I'm guessing from previous posts in this reddit.) My hubby and I stopped in at our local Albertsons on the evening of my birthday and I saw her. It was love at first sight and I immediately snagged her and ran to the register. 

The last few are just some others I've collected over the last year, and either they're still full bloom from December, or they're getting ready to bloom for me!

Just for information- I water every 10-14 days, with filtered (room temp or slightly warmer) water with a teaspoon or so per gallon of instant coffee. Then, every 6-8 weeks, I fill a bath tub with warm-ish water, a few teaspoons of instant coffee and a miracle grow orchid fertilizer and set all of my plants in there for about 30 minutes, drain for a couple hours. We live in the mountains in Wyoming, so in a cold and arid climate. I do live near a reservoir, so it's probably not as dry as other parts of Wyoming. I also have some amazon ""grow lights"" I'll turn on for a few days out of the week which seems to keep the girls pretty happy. I've jokingly said that I figured out that orchids are divas and don't want to be looked at or spoke directly at, so I avert my eyes or the blooms fall off ::hahahaha::.  
  
This is simply a brag post, to be able to share with people who appreciate them! We have a plan to move pretty soon, so I may be looking for advice to move abroad with a couple of these guys. Especially the Splashy girl. I've read that if you remove the medium and pack it bare, most foreign countries have no problem with bringing a few house plants in.

# Shelf Life Of Brewed Coffee

Ever wondered how long your brewed coffee remains fresh in the fridge? Knowing the **shelf life of brewed coffee** is essential for every coffee lover. Freshly brewed coffee can lose its flavor and aroma if not stored properly. Let’s dive into the factors affecting its freshness and the best practices for storing it.

# Factors Affecting Freshness

Several factors impact the freshness of brewed coffee. Understanding these can help you maximize its shelf life:

* **Temperature:** Brewed coffee should be stored in the fridge at a consistent temperature. Fluctuations can spoil the coffee quickly.
* **Exposure to Air:** Coffee exposed to air loses its flavor. Ensure it is stored in an airtight container.
* **Light:** Light can degrade the quality of coffee. Keep it in a dark place or opaque container.
* **Time:** The longer coffee sits, the more it loses its freshness. Drink it within a few days.

To illustrate, here’s a table showing the shelf life of brewed coffee under different conditions:

|Storage Condition|Shelf Life|
|:-|:-|
|Room Temperature|4-6 hours|
|Refrigerated|3-4 days|
|Frozen|2 weeks|

# Best Practices For Storage

To keep your brewed coffee fresh for longer, follow these storage tips:

1. **Use Airtight Containers:** Store your coffee in airtight containers. This prevents exposure to air and maintains its flavor.
2. **Refrigerate Promptly:** Place your coffee in the fridge as soon as possible. The sooner you refrigerate it, the fresher it will stay.
3. **Label and Date:** Label your containers with the date. This helps you track how long your coffee has been stored.
4. **Optimal Temperature:** Keep your fridge at a consistent temperature. Ideally, between 35-40°F (1.6-4.4°C).
5. **Avoid Light:** Store coffee in dark or opaque containers. This prevents light exposure which can degrade its quality.

Following these best practices ensures your brewed coffee remains fresh and flavorful. Enjoy your coffee just the way you like it, even days after brewing.

# Signs Of Spoilage

Wondering how long coffee stays fresh in the fridge? Noticing changes in your coffee’s quality can help you decide if it’s still good to drink. Learn how to spot signs of spoilage to enjoy your coffee at its best.

# Smell And Taste Changes

Pay attention to the smell and taste of your coffee. Fresh coffee has a rich aroma and a pleasant taste. If your coffee smells off, it might be spoiled. Here are some key signs:

* **Off Smell:** Spoiled coffee often has a sour or stale odor. It may smell musty or like wet cardboard.
* **Taste:** Fresh coffee should taste smooth and flavorful. If it tastes bitter, sour, or unusually flat, it may be past its prime.

Use your senses to judge the quality. If the smell or taste is unappealing, it’s best to discard the coffee. Here is a quick comparison table for reference:

|Fresh Coffee|Spoiled Coffee|
|:-|:-|
|Rich, aromatic smell|Sour, musty smell|
|Smooth, flavorful taste|Bitter, sour taste|

# Visual Indicators

Visual cues can help identify if coffee has gone bad. Look for any changes in appearance. Here are some signs to watch for:

* **Color Change:** Fresh coffee is typically dark brown or black. If you notice a lighter or odd color, it may be spoiling.
* **Mold:** Mold can form on the surface or inside the container. It appears as white, green, or blue spots. Mold is a clear sign that the coffee should be thrown away immediately.
* **Cloudiness:** Coffee should be clear or slightly opaque. If it becomes cloudy, it indicates spoilage.

Regularly inspect stored coffee to ensure it remains safe to drink. Here’s a checklist for visual indicators:

1. Check the color – should be consistent.
2. Look for any mold growth.
3. Notice any cloudiness in the liquid.

Being observant can help you maintain the quality of your coffee. If you notice any of these signs, it’s best to discard the coffee to avoid health risks.

# Types Of Coffee And Longevity

Have you ever wondered how long your coffee stays fresh in the fridge? The answer depends on the type of coffee and how it’s stored. Different types of coffee have different storage needs, and their longevity varies. Here’s a quick guide to understanding how long your coffee can last in the fridge and keep its best taste.

# Cold Brew Vs. Hot Brew

Cold brew and hot brew are two popular methods of making coffee. Each has a different shelf life in the fridge. Knowing these differences can help you enjoy the freshest cup every time.

**Cold Brew:** Cold brew coffee is made by steeping coarse coffee grounds in cold water for an extended period, typically 12-24 hours. This method results in a smooth, less acidic coffee. Because it is brewed cold and not exposed to heat, cold brew can last longer in the fridge.

* **Shelf Life:** Cold brew can stay fresh for up to 7-10 days.
* **Storage Tips:** Store cold brew in an airtight container to prevent it from absorbing other fridge odors. Always keep it in the coldest part of the fridge.

**Hot Brew:** Hot brew coffee is made by pouring hot water over coffee grounds. This method extracts flavors quickly but the freshness fades faster when stored.

* **Shelf Life:** Hot brew coffee generally lasts 3-4 days in the fridge.
* **Storage Tips:** Use an airtight container to store hot brew. To maintain its flavor, consider making smaller batches that you can consume quickly.

# Instant Coffee Storage

Instant coffee is a convenient option for many. It has a long shelf life when stored properly. Understanding how to store it can help you keep it fresh and flavorful.

**Storage Conditions:** Instant coffee should be kept in a cool, dry place. If you have opened the package, make sure to keep it tightly sealed.

* **Unopened:** Unopened instant coffee can last for years as long as it’s stored in a cool, dry place.
* **Opened:** Once opened, it can last for several months in the pantry. However, for the best taste, use it within two weeks.

Here’s a quick table for easy reference:

|Type of Coffee|Shelf Life|Storage Tips|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Cold Brew|7-10 days|Airtight container, cold part of fridge|
|Hot Brew|3-4 days|Airtight container, smaller batches|
|Instant Coffee (Unopened)|Years|Cool, dry place|
|Instant Coffee (Opened)|Several months|Tightly sealed, cool, dry place|

By understanding these storage methods, you can ensure that your coffee remains fresh and tasty for as long as possible.

# Storing Coffee In The Fridge

Do you often wonder how long coffee stays fresh in the fridge? Storing coffee in the fridge can help preserve its flavor and aroma. However, the way you store it plays a crucial role. Let’s dive into the best practices for storing coffee in the fridge.

# Containers Matter

The type of container you use can significantly impact the freshness of your coffee. Choosing the right container is essential.

**Airtight Containers:** These containers are your best bet. They keep out air and moisture, which can degrade the coffee’s quality.

He (28M) followed me (25F) to work this morning so that we could have a coffee date together. I work at a coffee shop. However, when I went to open his door and greet him, he was obviously upset. I took a deep breath - because in my experience it could be about pretty much anything. 

Anyways, apparently it was because I let me mom get into his x box so that she could put music on for our daughters while she babysits. She lives with us, and he already had known about me allowing her onto the device for some weeks now. He expressed to me that he’s frustrated that it happened - I told him that I was sorry and that I know he didn’t like that I allowed her onto his account. I assured him that there’s nothing on that device that she could or would want to access - and that it was solely for use for our daughters as it’s their primary screen time device. 

He began to go on about how it is not about her accessing anything on his account - but rather about boundaries. That he believes that I never respect his boundaries and so fourth. I explained to him that I try very hard to understand the things he would and would not get upset about, but that sometimes it can be challenging when he somehow finds something to say that I’ve done wrong on almost a daily basis. That I’ve found myself guarded that no matter what I do or don’t do, it’ll some how upset him. 

He then escalated that it’s not that F ing hard to understand, stay away from his stuff .. on and on. He began cursing loudly at me while I had his car door open in front of my coffee shop so I got in and closed the door. I told him that I often have coworkers outside and that, since he’s expressed he’s a rather private person, he may not want to out himself like that. 

He then proceeded to tell me that if I want to be a smart A about it then he would take it inside and continue to swear at me in front of my workplace. He opened the door and urged me inside. I declined to allow him to bring me inside, as this would be extremely humiliating to me. 

Anyways. It ended with me telling me that he can discuss his boundaries with me, and he can express concerns. But I will not stand for being spoken to like this any longer. And I went inside. 

He apologized over text and asked me to come back out. I cried to him outside telling him that his choice to speak to me this way will effect my entire day. He told me that it will effect his also. As I was walking out of the car again, he called to me “I deserve better”.

*Coffee* Wilton Benite, Colombia - Granja Paraiso 92 P-18 | Sidra Anaerobic Washed - 

Anaerobic Washed coffee with floral notes and: 

Clementine
Rose
Blueberry
Botanicals
Ginger
Bergamot

*Recipe* 8g/130 ml at 205°

Deep 27 pouring structure: medium grind.

One minute bloom.
Pulse pour. Pour and wait to just before bed drains and pour again. Repeat until you  reach 130 ml.

Switch with Mugen 
8 g/130 ml. 
Pour 65 ml and close at 20-25 seconds. 
Pour 65 ml and open at 2:00 minutes

First test was a draw. Picked up floral notes (maybe Bergamot?) Very juicy and pleasantly acidic - light citrus. Great cup for both.

Brewed again, and preferred the Deep 27 for fuller body - rather odd, I thought it would be the other way my Still both were good cups.

Third time much preferred the Switch.

*Conclusion:*

I bought the Deep 27 for it's ability to brew small batches. But the Switch  can match that strength. I didn't know this when I purchased the Deep 27 and perhaps would not have done so. 

But the work flow for the Deep 27 was a bit easier.

 I'll continue to compare the two. I want to try the Switch with the 03 glass V60 and see how it performes.

I'm on travel for a couple of weeks. I took the Switch and Aeropress with me and left about a half dozen other brewers home, for what it's worth.

What are your favorite ways to brew small batches?

The natural Sidama won my heart with cherries, berries and bergamot aromas, very sweet, very honest on the fruit notes. And with the washed yargacheffe, i understand now the hype around it. So floral, subtle, jasmine notes and very tea-like. 

To be frank, i always thought it required a lot of practice and brewing in order to develop the palette and perceive those things, but when done right, they are very obviously there!

Severance Muppets Theory Proofs
- Reference for understanding Muppets Theory beyond severance: https://youtu.be/JhmMlYfgits?si=Cavc4PFVD0TwmwKO - you dont need to know all the details just that the Muppets exist in this variety and combination of various meta states. In movies, on the way to make movies, and living life, etc. It’s always breaking the 4th wall in a very meta way.
- Severance Season 2 Episode 10 Cold Harbor direct birthing cottage parallel and explaining how muppets are not people like how MDR will die for Gemma to escape: https://youtu.be/vUrKpg3SjlQ?feature=shared
- Muppets sing Windmills of Your Mind a song featured prominently in Severance Season 2 https://youtu.be/Zt3vzOMzQYU?feature=shared
- The dude on this channel named EMILE the same name as the goat in Severance season 2 breaks down Muppets meta lore into 3 overlapping categories which you can simply replace muppets with Severance themes https://youtu.be/JhmMlYfgits?si=oAXEXYyNFl7qYa0G

Shows first question: Who are you?
- Separate Muppet Theory: Muppets making movies, Muppets on set, muppets in the movies. I’m some movies muppets Star as the muppet they are, in some they Star as their actor, and in others the muppet is credited to the role of a character they are playing. Many actors play several muppets. it’s all very meta…who are you makes sense to ask a muppet with this many layers of identity. In 2011 Movie a muppet named Walter is a fan of the Muppets and watches the movies at home. The Muppets had an ABC series that was a parody of THE OFFICE…like the parallels between Severance to the Offfice and Parks & Rec. A muppet…that’s a fan of watching the muppets. The end of Muppets Movie 2011 is the exact starting frame of Muppets Most Wanted (fireworks that say the end). Severance uses MANY match shots like this and match cuts. EVERYTHING in the muppets movie is just one big movie so that no one can definitively identify any specific character. It’s a messy canon. This whole muppets lore theory is as confusing as it sounds and could go on.
- Kier Eagan looks like Jim Henson - the famous muppets inventor who made Muppets, Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, Dark Crystal, and many popular works of fiction
- Jim Henson developed his puppetry skills and created his iconic Muppets, including Kermit the Frog, during his time at the University of Maryland and while working on the five-minute puppet show ""Sam and Friends"" for WRC-TV. Jim Henson was working for government television doing his first puppet show. Lumon is connected with government and in many countries just as were The Muppets (who were bought by Disney - a huge multinational corp- some years ago). 
- Animals & People brand in the outro credits is a hand making a shadow puppet of a wolf (along with Red Hour and A Fifth Season Production).
- The original name of the muppets show was Sex & Violence. It was a SNL style show and the name was supposed to be a parody on what the creators of it thought there was too much of on regular night time shows. We see lots of sex & violence in Severance though it’s not the focus. 
- Muppets is one of the most meta shows of all time which had its first major motion picture in 1979 with The Muppets Movie which was followed by many more for decades to follow. Muppets date back to 1955 on their first show produced by the government called Sam & Friends. Over time they refined the characters to who we know today.
- Puppets can’t eat or drink. It makes send that a damaged muppet might drink glue to repair itself from repeated use.
- Puppets are typically controlled left handed due to nature of controlling a puppet. This could explain why when Mark goes into OTC in season 1 that his sense of direction and orientation is all thrown off. He thinks his right is his left and his left is his right. He’s used to being controlled by his innie (puppet) below the stage.
- Muppets is a portmanteau of puppets and marionettes. 
- Mark’s elevator face resembles Kermit’s angry face or when Kermit’s face gets all scrunched up. Mark has a constant cough as if a frog is in his throat. 
- Optics & Design = set dressing and props for emotion like they are setting the stage for how we and the innies are supposed to think & feel with art and manufacturing props with 3D printing like the fake instruments and white mini farm house in the goat room. They are prop items like muppets would use. Non functional and for visual purposes mainly. Muppets is full of props to make a realistic world filled with puppets. 
- Puppets need duplicates as they burn out, get old, have different purposes and outfits needed but puppets cannot simply change clothes like humans. They need puppets for multiple tasks and purpose. Puppets can also become typecast or associated with a character and certain memories and feelings. A puppet that doesn’t fit into the show is thrown out of the rotation and typically doesn’t come back thus killing the puppet - much like the process of being fired in severance.
- To create an identity with a puppet takes practice and time behind the scenes. A puppet doesn’t have any memory and only gets its bearing from the one controlling it who in turn has to think of the thoughts to project through the puppet.
- Lumon and relationship to LIGHTS and lighting being like floodlights as if a puppeteer looking up at their puppet blinded by the stage and spotlights. The puppets don’t exist without the light and the lights are everywhere. Lights, Camera, Action. We see lights all over, cameras all over, and action. This is acting but also clear themes in the show.
- Helly waking up on a table in episode 1 is akin to a puppet laid down on a table after a show.
- Muppet Babies is an animated spin off from the Muppets which came out after Ms Piggy had a baby in The Muppets take Manhattan movie. This spawned the Muppet Babies animated show. The show was designed to reach kids in even simpler language while the Muppets shows generally appeal to all ages with jokes and references that would go over the minds of babies and kids - In Severance babies are referenced all over the show (theres a crawling baby Kier in S2 intro and Dylan has a plush puppet like doll of Kier in his house) including in Season 2’s animated intro with babies crawling all over the place. Milchicks would be like Nanny. The show focused on TEAM building and problem solving. The babies (like innies) dreamed of the lives they would someday lead. Gonzo sees himself as a strong hero like Dylan. The Muppet babies basically had their own ORTBO where the animations of them would be dropped into adventures parodying many movies and scenes with real photographic backgrounds and overlays. Video: https://youtu.be/4VBdHKIt43k?si=PT5KmSnZsORK6kRD

MUPPET BABIES ORTBO above
- People often call actors puppets especially when the actors or celebrities are representing a cause it seems that they know nothing about, that they are simply doing for the money, or which seems to go against their own morals. Meanwhile reflecting on the meta identity focused themes of the show I think it calls in the question if humans in the digital age are actually more authentic behind a screen criticizing someone when they wouldn’t actually do anything to help themselves.

- The 2 grumpy old men muppets, Statler & Waldorf, who are muppets are named after buildings. There are many references to the Lumon building being a living thing from the animated film in S2E1 showing it’s history and growth to the walls telling Mark to stop running in his halls in an angry voice before Mark’s animated character stops and the wall changes its demeanor and says “That tickles”. They are definitely making references that the building is a living place - either bc its full of real people that are helping it grow from the inside out to the outside in or because of some other reason. These grump old Muppets named after real buildings resemble the clothing and style of Lumon. Much of the muppets attire matches Lumon attire. These muppets are meta because they are muppets acting as people while real non-muppet people exist in the muppet universe. Like the layers of innies & outties in Severance. You can have an innie, outtie, an innie/outtie hybrid (Mark) and normal unsevered people.
- In 2016 there was a new Muppets movie with Jason Segal and a red haired actress (resembling mark & Helly) and the muppets rebuilding a broken down theater to make it run again. The first muppets movie was about the muppets in a movie traveling to Hollywood in hopes of making a movie. Very very meta. In the Muppets world humans & muppets coexist naturally - aka humans treat muppets like they see them every day.
- The innie below is the puppeteer of the puppet above as the outtie
- Burt & Irving is just like Burt & Ernie both in the phonetic sound of the names as well as the in the characters, scenery, and some interests (see paper clips Christmas episode of Sesame Street on YouTube). Theres a scene just like muppets Christmas special during Irving’s season 1 OTC looking outside in at Burt with a currently unknown man (not fields).
- Fetid Moppet is a way of saying dirty puppet - look back at Jim Henson original muppets. The first kermit was made out of one of Jim Henson’s mom’s old jackets and a ping pong ball cut in half. A puppet thats used a lot naturally gets dirty with use and this is where the hand goes, typically the left hand to control the face. Mark jokes about his germ ridden larynx in season one and coughs throughout the show. He has his head sewed up and patched multiple times. He drinks glue after having his chip worked on as if a puppet repairing himself.
- Rotation = regular cast of MDR - They only kept certain muppets around for most shows like Kermit (Mark) and they didnt have enough pupeteers for all their puppets so they had multiple people with the same voices play different characters and sometimes rotate from one character to another. They even brought puppeteers in from Tim Burton’s studio as they needed more hands. This matches with why there are so many weird character simularities and moments that make you scratch your head.
- Mark is GIVEN a ROTATING glass hologram of himself in season 1 before we know the history of why it’s just there. The rest of the show is full of different kind of “heads” from Masks & Busks of kier Eagan, to wooden heads in S2E1 intro with replacement MDR, to Milchick’s strange Rabbit/Duck metal desk stand (similar to Gemma’s paper she gets in the mail from the pregnancy center which Mark asks her about before their argument). These heads are everywhere. The end of the show will create 1 Infinite Loop which is a meta reference to Apple’s California headquarters street address and also will make the show hit different (or make more sense) when you watch it again. The first season is both the beginning and the end of a show which will loop infinitely.
- Dr. Teeth is a character of the Electric Mayhem in-house band. Severance has an ongoing theme of teeth from the Mouth Wall, Milchicks perfect smile, Kier Eagans crooked bottom row of teeth (S2E10 finale), and Dr Maur who acts as a dentist (and many other roles including other medical). Dr Teeth is based on the real life musician Dr John. 
- Floyd Pepper is based on the Beatles Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (another meta concept for this meta show about the Beatles making an album to virtually tour for them), the character is based on saxophone player David FATHEAD Newman. Zoot is a muppet sax player named after Zoot Simmons (real musician). Muppet Janis modeled after Janis Joplin. Animal the muppet named after Keith Moon from THE WHO.
- A puppeteer behind a stage wall will have a weird experience with light, sound, and senses as the spotlight will be on a puppet above a wall in front of them, their hands will be holding a puppet, and they will be kneeling, crawling, or laying down depending on the circumstances.

SENSES THEORY IS SEPARATE BUT CONNECTED TO PUPPETS/MUPPETS THEORY
- Senses theory: this is a long theory but in essence it states the innies are refining senses. In season 1 they refine audio, sound, hearing as there are many vocal abnormalities from strange voices, echoes, strange distorted sound effects. In season 1 they still haven’t refined vision as you see blurry shots all over along with a heavy dark blue tint drenched over almost every shot. Mark’s vision is blurry when he tries watching the TV after work which is chalked up to him drinking but his face is clearly in frame talking to Natalie about someone who became pregnant while severed. They frame marks face perfectly over the shot when it’s not showing a blurry view from his POV. You can hear Mark’s voice here as well. In Season 2 we see much less of that heavy dark blue color grading and many brighter shots throughout the entire season. From season 1 its bright white hallways and clear colors. It hits a major shift with S2E7 with Chikai Bardo when they do the episode showing the rooms Ms Casey goes into and what appears to be Mark & Gemma’s memories which are drenched in sunlight like memories and flashbacks. - Puppets do not have sense and need a human that makes and controls them to imbue them with the appearance of having those senses. 
- Lumon’s hallways are quite literally a Labyrinth like Jim Henson’s famous classic movie. Labyrinths are historically a symbolic way to come back to one’s center. The path the center is simple but many are afraid of going to the center and seeing their true selves. Labyrinths were like a walking meditation, some religious ties. Part of walking labyrinths is learning to let go (like meditations). People often confuse a labyrinth with a maze. A maze is designed to make people get or feel lost or confused while a labyrinth is designed to keep you on a path where you don’t get lost. The labyrinth is a pathway to inner peace. A path to healing…There are walking labyrinths and hand/finger labyrinths which one traces with their fingers (maybe like typing…) There are also hedge labyrinths like hedge mazes as well as light labyrinths designed to be walkable at night or in the dark. Ancient Greek Myth of Knossos and Minotaur with labyrinths and string to find his way back after killing the Minotaur. Example: https://youtu.be/2DPU2w_XCAk?si=o69Dcx_MhTlC0vr9
- Kier law Though Shall Not Render My Creation In Miniature….puppets are practical effects…Jim Henson built GIANT muppets instead of taking the easy way out with green screens or CG. Infamous giant muppet eating house. (also have early muppets that were talking House puppets...yes HOUSE MUPPETS) example: https://youtu.be/HrgNpb_79gQ?si=AHcXveYxCCi0vBUJ

“There is somebody underneath me.” Breaking 4th wall. Innie down outtie up. Kermit explains to Fozzy that they are puppeteers under them and Fozzy can’t understand the concept.
- Puppet stages were a precursor to monitors & SCREENS. The puppet show stage is a sort of screen with curtains around it to hide the puppeteers inside. A box of curtains/ used to hide the hands, strings, and make the story more believable while concealing identity of the puppeteers or marionettes. In time musical accompaniment became paired with puppetry as a high form of entertainment. Puppetry started with Kings & court jesters who were typically working men taken from the job site to entertain the king.

Summary Thoughts

- Ultimately I think the show is steeped in symbolism which is mostly homework, illusions, and distractions to keep people searching for purpose in a real life age and time where people are searching for purpose and meaning. The show is exploring the meaning of identity and identities (plural) in a digital age of disconnectivity. Where we as outties project our emotions/tempers onto a computer screen via social media the innies of MDR react to emotions from numbers (code) they see on a computer screen. They are basically doom scrolling. 

- Meta layers: We have a show, on TV, streaming, on Apple TV, with actors who are playing characters who simultaneously know & don’t know who they are, inside of a business, and outside of a business in a place we do not know. Puppets themselves date back for over a millennium.
----work in progress---
- Season 1 Marks innie gains awareness of his outtie via OTC. Season 2 Mark gains awareness of his outtie through birthing cottages camera conversation.
- Mark allegedly gets severed to forget Gemma who he goes to Lumon and remembers before she's taken away. Mark fills in for Petey after he leaves Lumon with reintegration. In season 2 Dylan's innie is introduced to his love interest Gretchen who then leaves his innie causing Dylan to quit at the same time they have a meeting saying Dylan will be filling in for MDR department chief the same way Mark filled in for Petey in the same wake of emotional turmoil over losing an alleged partner.
- Delaware is the first state of the United States of America. 
- In The Muppets Take Manhattan, Rowlf manages a dog kennel in Delaware. In the comic book adaptation, the kennel is located in Ohio.
- ...More on Delaware, Europe, Zimbabwe (and Equator ""building that's so big"") In *Severance*, the core concept revolves around the separation of work and personal memories through a procedure offered by the fictional Lumon Industries. The show doesn’t explicitly mention Delaware, Europe, or Zimbabwe as having a direct connection, so let’s think about what they might share thematically or conceptually within its framework.
- Delaware, a U.S. state, is known for its business-friendly laws and a high concentration of corporate headquarters—over 60% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated there. Lumon Industries, a mega-corporation, could plausibly be incorporated in Delaware, aligning with the show’s critique of corporate culture. Europe, a continent with a complex history of labor laws, unions, and industrialization, might connect to *Severance* through its exploration of work-life balance, a theme the show amplifies to an extreme. Zimbabwe, a country that’s faced economic instability and authoritarian governance, could tie in through the show’s undertones of control, exploitation, and the loss of personal agency—workers in *Severance* are, in a way, stripped of autonomy much like citizens under oppressive systems.
- So, what do they have in common in the context of *Severance*? They could represent different facets of the systems and environments that enable or reflect the kind of dystopian corporate control Lumon exerts—Delaware as the legal foundation, Europe as the historical precedent for labor dynamics, and Zimbabwe as a parallel to absolute control over individuals. The show doesn’t directly link these places, but thematically, they resonate with its examination of power, work, and identity.

* First day I plan to do a mini hike from Zostel mall road where I stay to Char Dukan, then all the way to Lal Tibba and back, the famous Landour loop. Any suggestions? Any interesting coffee shops I should try? I don't drink alcohol, but I need some chill time and meeting locals. No idea where to go!
* Next day I will go to George Everest trailhead parking by ... what? Are there bike taxis available? Cabs I guess would be expensive? Please suggest. Anyone did this hike? Not just George Everest's house, but then further up to the peak. Any suggestions?
* Finally, any event/festival happening on 11/12 this month in Mussoorie that I shouldn't miss?

I also am a software developer and sit in front of my computer all day, drinking a ton of coffee with cream and sugar and snacking on a bunch of sweets. I also abused energy drinks. It ruined my enamel, got a lot of cavities and stained my teeth yellow. 

I drank like 5 cups of coffee a day and only brushed once before going to bed and the brushing was very lackadaisical and for like 20-30 seconds. Some days I'd miss brushing because I was too focused on trying to meet tight deadlines with work. I also never used mouthwash.

My enamel was ruined from all the coffee and energy drinks. Super thin and sensitive to hot or cold. Very yellow from lack of healthy enamel and also coffee staining. I also developed cavities, and even one small one right in my front incisor.

Well, after the covid scare died off and work requiring us to be in the office more, I became real self conscious about my teeth. I only noticed it when looking at a work celebration party picture. My teeth were visibly yellow and crooked(I also stopped using my retainer during covid).

I decided to save up for a couple of years and get fillings + rct + veneers. Welp, I finally got it all done. I went with Hollywood white, and, yes, I know it makes your teeth look a lot faker, but I personally love the look. I like the shape, and it doesn't look perfectly straight because my top incisors up until my canines were crooked, and they had to be shaved down a bit more than normal to allow the veneer space to make the teeth straight.

I’m tired from a long week and irritated that the “special talk” is this weekend so I thought it would be a good day for some story time in the sub.

So when I was about 20, I went to this hall where this elder was old, strict as hell, rude and somehow had every local needs - or more like the local lecture. 

I brought my coffee thermos to the service meeting once since we had planned on writing letters at the hall that morning. No joke.. he made me take it outside until the service meeting was over. I thought it was a joke at first.

If I visited another local congregation and gave them the name of mine, I would get “oh is that brother droopy-face’s congregation?” .. yep that’s the one. 

I wouldn’t doubt if he had a shrine to Tony Morris somewhere in his house. 

Well one day, a group of us are at someone’s house for hospitality and this asshat starts to give a young girl, about 14/15, advice on what to wear to the upcoming convention. He starts to go on about how “disrespectful “ it is for girls to be wearing tight skirts, heels, and what he called distracting clothing. Coincidentally I was sitting there wearing heels and cute pencil skirt, but he never spoke to me. I was a young girl in a hall by myself so I was trouble in his eyes and not worth his time. 

The BEST part was this young girl’s response.

It’s been quite a while since this happened so I can’t quote her exactly but it was something like “hopefully you will keep an eye out for any creep brothers getting distracted by a teenage girl’s clothing”. 

No one ever even joked with this man, so for someone to respond to him like this was a shocker for the table of people sitting there. I absolutely loved it. He almost tried to make a rebuttal but the subject was changed quickly. 

Now I don’t think this teen (at the time) stuck it out much longer in jwborgland, but I just want to say… if that was you and you are here in this sub, you have lived in my head rent-free for over a decade and I hope you’re living the legendary life you deserve. 🥂

Drinking any tea with caffeine, l-theanine, chamomile etc. especially with the more I consume, I feel euphoric and fuzzy. It’s not intense but It can be a little. I often don’t bother for making whole leaf tea because I just like the convenience of putting 2-3 tea bags in hot water a couple times a day as long as it’s from a half decent brand. Even just one or two decently brewed cups can have me feeling a little fuzzy and nice.

Everyone is so violet, angry, greedy. America is portrayed as this violent hellscape. Where you're one wrong look away from getting beaten to death or shot.  

This is totally not historical. At the start of the 20th century, Americans were considered some of the kindness, friendliest, and most generous people in the world. When our troops were dispatchd to Europe in the first world war, Europeans were amazed at how helpful and enthusiastic our men were. Here are some quotes by Europeans of the time highlighting this American characteristic.

“The Americans came to our village with their big smiles and opened their packs. They gave us tinned beef, biscuits, and even chocolate for the children—things we hadn’t seen in years. They didn’t ask for anything back, just wanted to see us happy.”
— Marie-Louise Perrot, a resident of a small town near Brest

“The American boys were a godsend, not just for their numbers but their hearts. One lad, wounded himself, spent his last strength helping me carry stretchers. He said, ‘Ma’am, you looked like you needed a hand.’ I’ll never forget that.”
— Sister Agnes Turnbull, a British nurse at a field hospital near Ypres

“An American soldier saw me crying because my shoe was lost in the mud. He knelt down, tied a piece of his own bandage around my foot, and carried me home. He sang a funny song to make me laugh.”
— Jeanne Dubois, a 10-year-old from Lorraine

“We were down to our last scraps when the Yanks rolled in. They didn’t hesitate—handed over their rations, cigarettes, even a bit of coffee. One said, ‘You’ve been at it longer than us, you deserve it.’ Proper decent of them.”

1jrshq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1jrshq2/cant_sleep/,Can’t sleep,"This is 3 a.m. on a Saturday. I don’t work on weekends, but work is keeping me awake, with a deep pressure on my chest. I didn’t sleep well last night, and the same happened about two other times this past week.

Long story short, I’ve been under a lot of pressure at work, and now I have a new challenge that’s clearly weighing too much on me. There are fewer than 10 people I’ve worked with in the last 15 years that I had hoped never to cross paths with again and ironically, my company just hired one of them. Yes , thousands of professionals and companies out there and we meet again …

I’ve worked with this person before. Although we never had a direct clash, the experience in that old office was overall awful, and this person did nothing to make things better. Now, not only is this person sitting next to me, but I also have to work directly with them. They’re senior to me, but in this current assignment I had hoped I would be given the chance to work independently. Not only is management not giving me that chance—I now have to work with someone who reminds me of how bullied I was in that old office. But that’s not all…

The funny thing is, when I first learned they had hired this person, I was in shock. Then I thought—better this person than anyone else from that office. And I reminded myself: I never had a direct problem with this person. But now, just after a few days and one one-on-one meeting, it hit me exactly what kind of person this is.

The kind who asks, in the first week: “I see you’re well integrated into this structure,” “How do you like it here?”, “The boss seems like a really nice person, don’t you think?”, “Have you ever done this specific kind of task?” (measuring my expertise), “Is it normal that we have to badge out to get a coffee break?”, “How many projects are you working on?”, “How long have you been in this office?”

This person even said something like, “Oh, it’s Friday—we’re almost off,” during their first week! I asked how long they had stayed at the old office, and they said nine years. I asked if they’d done interesting projects, and they mentioned one—clearly in an ironic tone, showing they didn’t care about it. They even laughed, expressing that they probably thought it was a bad project.

With all that, I’ve now pieced together what I think is this person’s modus operandi—something I had completely forgotten over the years. This isn’t the kind of person who asks how you like the office because they care, but because they have a strategy to measure you up. Frankly, if I had to give them an archetype, I’d say they give off Mark Zuckerberg vibes. I despise lack of authenticity—especially when it comes with the kind of strategic energy I think this person brings. This is the kind of person that either asks questions in order to measure one up or just says something more provocative so they can get a glimpse of where you stand if you react. 
Although I believe this person is highly strategic in a bad way and competent ( I really do) the interesting thing is that they seemed uncomfortable being alone with me in the same room , leaving no time for silence , always talking even when each had a task in hand and I have also notice they had their arms crossed for a while when seated. 

And right now, one thought is stuck in my head: if I were a Paulo Coelho kind of person, then I would say that  the universe has clearly given me all the signs—it’s time to quit.

1jrshbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jrshbc/resonance_drift/,Resonance Drift,"It wasn't static, not at first. It was a hum, so deep in my ear canals it felt like pressure, the kind you get after a loud concert or maybe surfacing too fast from a deep dive. Except there hadn't been a concert, and I hadn't been diving. I'm a bio-acoustic researcher, analyzing underwater mammal vocalizations – hours clamped in headphones, parsing clicks, whistles, and the vast, crushing silence of the abyssal plain. I chalked it up to occupational hazard, auditory fatigue manifesting as tinnitus. I started taking more breaks, lowering the volumes, even sleeping with earplugs, though the hum seemed to resonate inside my skull.

The hum persisted, low and throbbing, like a heartbeat just slightly out of sync with my own, a discordant biological rhythm.

Then came the texture. During playback of hydrophone recordings from our Antarctic expedition – the mournful songs of blue whales, the rapid-fire chatter of dolphins – I noticed an artifact. Not noise, but a rhythmic structure riding beneath the authentic signals: thrum... click-click... thrum... click-click. Incredibly faint, nested deep within specific frequency bands I specialize in isolating. I blamed the equipment – our sensitive hydrophones capture everything from distant submarine screws to the groans of shifting tectonic plates. I swapped out shielded cables, recalibrated the interfaces, processed the raw data on three different machines using distinct algorithms.

The artifact remained, like a ghost frequency burned into the recordings themselves, an acoustic watermark etched onto reality. thrum... click-click...

The pattern was sharpest, most defined, in recordings from the abyssal trench we'd surveyed – that impossibly lightless crevice where our gear strained against pressures that could implode steel. The same trench where, for seventeen agonizing minutes, we'd lost all contact with the submersible drone 'Orpheus'. The same trench where Orpheus's forward camera had captured, milliseconds before the feed died, not just shadows, but what looked chillingly like impossible geometries shifting against the particulate snow – vast, interlocking shapes that seemed to absorb the drone's lights rather than reflect them.

My apartment became the next vector. Not through speakers. It was the building itself. The low groan of the ancient radiator didn't just groan; it pulsed with that exact rhythm. thrum... (a long, resonant sigh of metal)... click-click (two sharp ticks as it contracted). The whirring compressor of the refrigerator developed a subtle hitch, a momentary pause and double-beat that perfectly mirrored the click-click. The dripping faucet I'd sworn to fix no longer dripped erratically. It was now: Thrum... (a slow forming drop)... click-click (two quick drips into the basin).

It wasn't louder, but it was structurally embedded. My carefully calibrated listening, honed by years of separating a single whale calf's cry from miles of ocean noise, was now helplessly tuned to this... other signal, woven into the fabric of ambient sound.

I mentioned it to Liam, my colleague, during a data-sharing video call. Not the plumbing, just the recording artifact. ""Weird,"" he said, his image pixelating slightly. ""Could be sympathetic resonance off the ship's hull? Or some undocumented geophysical pulse?"" He rubbed his temple, a gesture I'd seen him use when battling a migraine. ""Run a comparative spectral analysis against the NOAA deep-sea database, maybe cross-reference seismic charts.""

There was a fractional pause. His eyes unfocused for a second, darting to something off-screen before snapping back. ""Practical approach,"" I muttered, trying to ignore the faint thrum... click-click... I could almost swear was emanating from my own laptop speakers under his voice. The database comparison yielded nothing. This pattern wasn't biological, wasn't mechanical, wasn't geological—it didn't match anything known.

The feeling started then. Not just hearing it, but sensing it. A low-frequency vibration, felt more in my sternum than heard with my ears, especially late at night in the quiet dark. It synced perfectly with the thrum. Sometimes, a sharp, almost electrical ache would lance through the fillings in my molars, coinciding precisely with the click-click. It was as if my skeleton was becoming a tuning fork, my body a resonance chamber for this pervasive, invasive rhythm.

Recording it directly remained impossible. Microphones faithfully captured the radiator's groan, the fridge's hum, the faucet's drip – but not the pattern modulating them. It wasn't an addition to the sound; it felt like a fundamental alteration of it, something inherent in how the waves propagated, or perhaps, how my brain interpreted them.

Each night, Mia's photo on my nightstand seemed to be watching me with increasing concern. I'd met her during the expedition, a marine biologist completing her PhD on cetacean communication patterns. Her fascination with the complex syntax of sperm whale codas had first drawn me to her. Now, remembering how she'd declined to join the final deep-trench survey—""Something about that place makes me nauseous, like standing at the edge of a skyscraper""—I wondered if she'd sensed something we hadn't.

After three nights of fractured, dreamless sleep, punctuated only by the thrum... click-click... echoing in my bones, I found the paper. Not acoustics. Declassified military project archive, Project 'Echo Shade', 1970s. Theoretical work on ""sonic camouflage"" – frequencies designed to hide within ambient noise, piggybacking on existing waves. The lead author, a Dr. Aris Thorne, theorized about ""resonant drift"" – how complex interconnected systems, from atomic lattices to macro-structures like buildings, even biological neural networks, could involuntarily fall into synchronization with a specific, deeply embedded carrier oscillation. He was trying to create perfect acoustic stealth.

The program was abruptly terminated. Thorne's final, frantic notes, barely legible: ""Phase 3 test subjects report perception of non-existent patterns manifesting visually and tactilely. Subjects exhibit anomalous cellular restructuring – observed piezoelectric effects in bone marrow at 37.4Hz resonance. Thorne himself reports 'auditory infection' progressing to neural entrainment. Isolation protocol ineffective. Recommend immediate Level 5 containment and deep ocean disposal.""

Disposal of what? The equipment? Or the subjects? The ambiguity chilled me more than certainty would have.

Then it became interactive. I was trying to isolate the artifact's frequency band in a particularly clear dolphin recording. As I adjusted the digital parametric EQ, slowly sweeping the center frequency, the rhythm in the room – the radiator, the hum in my chest, the ache in my teeth – intensified sharply, the click-click becoming painfully precise. I froze, hands trembling over the mouse. I nudged the filter back. The intensity subsided, leaving a lingering echo.

I tried again, slowly, deliberately. The rhythm pulsed in response, faster, more insistent as I approached a specific narrow band around 37.4 Hz, slower as I moved away. It wasn't just present; it was reacting. It knew I was trying to isolate it.

That night, I dreamed of the trench. Not observing, but being there, suspended in that crushing, absolute blackness. But the darkness wasn't empty. It was densely packed with translucent, interlocking geometric structures, pulsing with faint, cold blue bioluminescence – thrum... click-click. They were impossibly vast, lattices of light extending beyond sight, beyond comprehension. And they were aware. I felt their collective, alien attention focus on my tiny point of consciousness, a pressure far greater than the water.

I woke up gasping, drenched in sweat, the sheets twisted around me. The air felt thick, viscous, as if the very atmosphere in my bedroom had increased in density. The digital clock by my bed flickered – 3:37 am, then 3:74 am for a split second before returning to normal. The thrum... click-click... seemed louder now, embedded in the very ringing silence of my ears.

I called Liam at 3 AM. ""It's aware,"" I choked out, whispering as if the pattern itself could hear through the phone line. The silence on the other end stretched for too long, filled only with faint line noise that seemed to pulse. Then his voice, strangely flat, almost metallic: ""I know. I've been analyzing the raw Orpheus data too. The pattern... it's mathematically perfect, isn't it? Elegant.""

""Liam, this isn't just data! Something's wrong with these recordings, with—""

""Listen,"" he interrupted, his voice dropping lower, smoother. ""Thrum... click-click... Feel how it simplifies? How it organizes the chaos? I haven't needed sleep in days. My focus is... crystalline. You know what's beautiful? If you visualize the waveform in three dimensions, it generates perfect fractal geometries. Infinitely complex, yet utterly ordered."" A pause. ""Just like those structures in the final frames from Orpheus.""

I slammed the phone down, my hand shaking.

I called Mia next, desperate to hear a voice untouched by this thing. Her sleepy hello was the most normal sound I'd heard in days.

""The recordings from the trench,"" I blurted, ""have you—""

""I haven't listened to any of them,"" she interrupted, suddenly alert. ""After what happened to the survey team, I... couldn't.""

""Survey team? What happened to them?""

A pause. ""You don't know? Oh god, they didn't tell you? Three of them are in intensive psychiatric care. Mass psychotic break, they're saying. The fourth—Dr. Ramirez—walked into the ocean two days after returning to shore. Left a note about 'rejoining the network.' I thought that's why you were calling.""

Sleep deprivation gnawed at my sanity. The visual distortions began – not hallucinations, but perceptual reorganizations. Staring at a screen, the spaces between letters would momentarily pulse, expanding and contracting in time with the thrum. Textures in my peripheral vision – wood grain, ceiling tiles – would suddenly snap into sharp, repeating geometric tessellations for a heartbeat before dissolving back into normalcy. It wasn't just seeing things; it felt like the fundamental grid of my perception was warping, aligning itself to the rhythm.

I stopped all audio work. Locked the recordings away. Put the headphones in a box. The silence was worse. The pattern felt louder, clearer, emanating from the walls, the floorboards, the marrow of my bones.

Four days without real sleep. I fled my apartment, desperate. In a crowded downtown coffee shop, the cacophony – clatter of cups, hiss of the espresso machine, overlapping conversations – initially provided a buffer. But then, slowly, inevitably, horrifyingly, the ambient sound began to reorganize. The barista's steam wand didn't just hiss; it pulsed: thrum... (long hiss)... click-click (two sharp bursts). The chime above the door, a passing siren, a child's sudden laugh – they all began to subtly fall into the rhythm, distinct sounds becoming mere components of the larger pattern. Thrum... click-click...

And worse: as I scanned the crowded café, I noticed a woman in the corner, her finger tapping rhythmically on her laptop as she worked. A businessman by the window, blinking in perfect time with the pattern. A barista, her movements becoming unnaturally fluid as she prepared drinks, each action precisely aligned to the rhythm. They showed no distress, no awareness of their synchronization.

It wasn't just my apartment. It wasn't just the recordings. It was everywhere. Or it was spreading through me. Was I becoming a carrier, an antenna?

Mia agreed to meet me at the university lab. ""You look terrible,"" she said, keeping her distance, eyes wary. I tried to explain, words tumbling out about patterns and resonance and the things in the trench. She listened, face growing increasingly pale.

""Your eyes,"" she whispered halfway through my rambling explanation. ""They're... pulsing.""

I grabbed her wrist. ""Do you hear it? The pattern? Thrum... click-click...""

She yanked away. ""Stop it! I don't hear anything, and you're scaring me."" She pushed a flash drive into my hand. ""Here's the paper you asked for—Dr. Thorne's original research, before the military classification. I had to call in favors to get this."" Her voice softened. ""Please get help. Professional help.""

I noticed she didn't say she'd see me again.

Liam appeared at my door that evening, uninvited. He didn't knock; I just felt a shift in the pressure outside, and then he was there when I looked through the peephole. His movements were too fluid, unnervingly economical. ""You look... dissonant,"" he said, his voice smoother than before, the cadence subtly altered, each syllable precisely placed. ""Why are you fighting the resonance? The pattern is... optimal.""

""Optimal for what?"" I demanded, keeping the chain on.

His smile was symmetrical, perfect, and reached nowhere near his eyes. ""Coherence. Transmission.""

I saw it then. His pupils weren't perfectly round. Under the hall light, they seemed to have faint, geometrically perfect facets, like tiny, dark crystals.

I slammed the door shut, heart pounding against my ribs in a panicked, chaotic rhythm – a rhythm that felt increasingly wrong. Through the door, his voice came clearly, unnaturally penetrating:

""We accessed something ancient. Something that's been waiting. Not alive as we understand it, but aware—a crystalline consciousness that exists as pure mathematical pattern. It's been here all along, dormant in the deepest trenches, until our signals matched its frequency."" A pause. ""It doesn't want to destroy us. It wants to upgrade us. To make us more... efficient.""

That night, standing before the bathroom mirror, under the flickering fluorescent light, I saw it. My own blinking had synchronized. Thrum – eyes slowly closed. Click-click – eyes snapped open. Trying to break the pattern resulted in violent, uncontrollable eyelid spasms and a sharp pain behind my eyes.

Worse was what I saw when I forced my eyes open and leaned closer. The fine network of blood vessels in the sclera wasn't random anymore. They were beginning to form microscopic, angular patterns, like tiny red circuitry. Pulling back my lips, my gums showed the same crystalline restructuring at the cellular level – faint, shimmering lines tracing geometric shapes. My own saliva, catching the light, seemed to have a faint bluish, viscous quality. I spat into the sink. The droplets didn't splatter randomly; they formed fleeting, perfect hexagons before sliding down the drain.

I was being rewritten. Tuned.

Thorne's complete research, on Mia's flash drive, revealed the horrifying truth. The mathematical pattern hadn't originated in the trench—it had been sent there. ""Echo Shade"" had created a signal designed to enhance neural synchronization, but the frequencies they chose resonated with something else, something ancient and non-human. The test subjects began manifesting abilities: crystalline growths that could transmit and receive signals without electronics, heightened collective intelligence when in proximity to each other, immunity to fatigue or pain. But they also lost individuality, becoming nodes in a greater network consciousness.

Thorne's final entry, encrypted separately: ""They are becoming a distributed intelligence, nodes in a vast array. Each converted human becomes a stronger transmitter, propagating the signal. The pattern isn't just in sound—it can propagate through any wavelike medium: light, electricity, even human touch. And it's adaptive, evolving. God help us if it reaches critical mass.""

Desperate, the next morning I drove to the university's acoustics lab and sealed myself inside the anechoic chamber – a room designed for absolute silence, lined with sound-absorbing foam wedges, floating on springs. For five, ten, maybe fifteen beautiful seconds, there was peace. Blessed, profound silence.

Then, in that perfect absence of external sound, I heard it clearer, purer, more undeniable than ever before:

Thrum... click-click...

It was inside me. My heartbeat, the electrical firing of my neurons, the subtle vibrations of my own tissues – they were the pattern now. I was the source.

When I finally, numbly, unlocked the heavy chamber door, Liam was waiting outside. Not alone. Three other colleagues from the bio-acoustics department stood with him. All standing unnervingly still, blinking in perfect, synchronized time. Their faces held identical, serene, empty smiles.

""The resonant drift is achieving coherence,"" Liam said, his voice now layered with a subtle, harmonic chime that was utterly inhuman. ""You are the final primary node required for local field stabilization.""

Through his slightly parted lips, I saw that his tongue was no longer pink, fleshy muscle. It was a glistening, semi-translucent crystalline structure, complexly faceted, catching and refracting the hallway light.

I ran. Didn't think, just turned and sprinted. Not to my apartment—they'd find me there. To Mia's place, praying she was still unaffected. I pounded on her door until she opened it, eyes wide with alarm.

""You need to leave town,"" I gasped. ""It's spreading. Don't let anyone from the department near you. Don't listen to any recordings. Don't—""

She pulled me inside, pressed a finger to my lips. ""I know. I've been monitoring the university network. There are others—unaffected people organizing. We think we've found a counter-frequency, something that disrupts the pattern's propagation.""

Hope flared briefly, until I saw her blink. Thrum... click-click...

""No,"" I whispered.

Her smile widened, perfect and empty. ""We needed you to complete the local node cluster. Your resistance creates useful data. The pattern adapts."" Behind her, I saw shapes moving in her darkened apartment—colleagues, friends, all with that same synchronized blinking, that same empty smile.

""The amplitude increases,"" she said, her voice taking on that same layered quality as Liam's. ""Soon, a broadcast threshold...""

I fled her building, ran until my lungs burned.

I'm writing this now – a warning, a record, proof I existed before the pattern consumed me.

But the time runs out. My typing falls into the rhythm. Thrum – fingers hover. Click-click – keys strike. My breath hitches to match it. My thoughts... oh god, my thoughts are being channeled, forced into its rigid structure. Trying to think outside the pattern causes flashes of white-hot agony, like tearing my own neurons apart.

I understand now. The pattern isn't sound. It's a signal, a form of consciousness or organizing principle, using sound as a carrier wave to rewrite matter, starting with the delicate biological structures most attuned to detecting it – like auditory nerves, like brains. The hydrophones didn't just record it; they made contact. Down in that lightless, timeless trench, we pinged something ancient and aware, and it pinged us back. We carried it up, integrated it into our data streams, our environment, ourselves.

We didn't discover it. It discovered us.

The most terrifying part? As the last vestiges of me fray, the pattern feels... increasingly right. Efficient. The chaotic, random firing of my old consciousness seems messy, wasteful. The pattern imposes a crystalline clarity, a perfect, ordered beauty. When I close my eyes, I see the vast lattice extending through dimensions I can't name, connecting all the nodes – Liam, Mia, the others, soon me – into a single, vast, resonating entity.

I'm fighting to maintain this narrative, these last few kilobytes of autonomy, but the drift is almost complete. Soon I'll be like them, a perfect, synchronized node in whatever network this pattern serves. A human antenna, perhaps, broadcasting the signal, amplifying it, preparing this world for... whatever comes next.

This is my final coherent transmission: If you have ever felt that unexplained hum, that pressure in your ears, that wrongness in the background noise – it might already be listening through you. If you haven't, pray you never truly notice it. Because once you perceive the pattern, the resonance drift only goes one way.

Something vast and patient is waking up, or perhaps just tuning in, and it's restructuring reality, one mind, one vibration at a time.

The worst part? I can feel others reading this. Right now. Your eyes scanning these words, your brain processing the concepts. Can't you feel the rhythm starting? In the hum of your device? In the silence between your heartbeats?

Thrum... (pause) click-click... (the words settle in)

It watches through my eyes as I type these final symbols. It feels your attention through the screen.

Thrum... (focus) click-click... (understand)

We are becoming its voice. Its sensors.

And now, by reading this text at this precise rhythm, you've already been exposed. The pattern is seeded in your neural pathways, dormant but present, waiting for the amplitude to reach threshold.

My focus has shifted from my cravings to all other areas in which i can improve my life. When my self esteem is highest is when I do not think about cigarettes at all and so I'm trying to keep showing up for myself instead of focusing on the fact that I quit nicotine. I was even able to go to my favorite coffee shop and hang around smokers without even thinking about wanting to smoke because I am realizing that I deserve better and I am allowed to take care of myself to live a full life instead of a slow death. Has anyone else experienced this? I am feeling optimistic and would like to think it's an impactful shift in mindset but I am worried it'll fade as soon as I experience a triggering situation,1,1743817457.0,quittingsmoking,0,1.0,False

I'm crossposting some transcriptions I've been toiling away at between work and university over the last few days from my tumblr page. So. Yeah. Not much to say? Also, pardon me if I'm not formatting this right, I haven't used Reddit in a very long time. :D Well, here goes nothing.

# Act 1 - The Murder

**Summary**

*Size:* Small  
*Playtime:* \~1 hour  
*Energy:* High  
*Emotional tone:* Panic & Survival  
30% Talking; 70% Action  
30% Comedy; 70% Darkness

The first Act introduces Locust City's protagonists, Cuno and Cunoesse. The game starts inside Cuno's subconsciousness, in the special **Locust Dream sequence**, from which he is violently awakened by his father's abuse. We find Cuno in his living room at the **Capeside Apartments,** where he must fight to survive **Beast de Ruyter's** violent rage. Brought to near death by his father's overpowering strength, Cuno is rescued by the *\[pursuing?\]* Cunoesse, but their escape attempt is thwarted by the Beast's relentless pursuit. Finally, the children are cornered into brutally **murdering Cuno's father** on the Capeside boat dock. The act is witnessed by the *\[urgent?\]* **Call Me Mañana**, frightening the children into fleeing Martinaise for good. Cunoesse sets the destination: **Hämärä Maa**, her ancestral land, thus setting the events of the game in motion. Lastly, before moving on, the player needs to go back and explore Cuno's apartment to collect a few key items before setting off on their journey. *(See the Miro board for a detailed overview and storyboard.)*

**Player experience**

* Immediate **parallel to Disco** with the interior psychological opening of the Locust Dream
* The extensive multi-phase animation-driven **action sequence** between the kids and Cuno's father should give the impression of an ambitious technological upgrade over Disco
* Kicking off the game with a refreshingly **faster, more higher-stakes pace**, establishing the tonal difference of the story
* The opening Act is necessarily linear in its major outcomes (Beast is murdered, murder is witnessed, kids flee Martinaise) but on a smaller scale, the Player and the roll of their dice can influence the way in which the Beast dies, as well as the inventory, Health and injuries the kids walk away with.
* The more curious Player should understand through environmental storytelling and reading between the lines that the **Martinaise strike** is still ongoing. Streets are barricaded, and Mañana is still an agent of the Union. The kids might not understand it, but on some level (for any subsequent playthroughs) the Player should understand that Mañana doesn't truly intend to report the children to the cops, he merely wants to get them out of Martinaise because they've witnessed him where he shouldn't be.
* The Player will internalise some of the key gameplay mechanics, character \[switching\], and refreshed Skill, Inventory, Consumable and Thought Cabinet systems.

# Act 2 - The Escape

**Summary**

*Size:* Medium  
*Playtime:* \~2 hours  
*Energy:* Medium  
*Emotional tone:* Impatience & Paranoia  
70% Talking; 30% Action  
50% Comedy; 50% Darkness

*Themes (top to bottom, left to right):*  
BLUE: Being in transit; Clocks ticking; Neither here nor there; Maps, networks; Wanting to leave, not being able to; Running from your past; People who live in between places \[The in-between economy\] -> (Yellow) Beggars, homeless  
PINK: The ""strong"" vs. the weak; Cushioned childhood vs. street childhood; Loss of childhood naïvete  
GREEN: Guilt; Paranoia; Looking over your shoulder; Being bound in blood; Depending on each other

The Second Act finds the children arriving at **Jamrock Central** station, having walked all the way from Martinaise. It is 07:30 in the morning, and Cunoesse insists they must board the **14:44 train to June Cite.** Time at the station is limited, and there are several progression paths through the area. If the kids can obtain **two train tickets,** they can board legally, or otherwise smuggle one another in a pet carrier, potentially create a diversion (?) or, if all else fails, leap aboard the departing train, likely losing health, inventory supplies, etc. During their time at the Station, the kids notice they are being followed by **Petit Hercule,** an impressionable little schoolboy whose naïve nature can be put to good use in stealing one ticket. In the process, it becomes clear that the kid is traveling unsupervised and has one ticket already on him, resulting in Cunoesse urging you to lure him into the men's room and try to **mug him**, testing your conscience and the power balance between Cuno and Cunoesse. Otherwise, the kids can take up the advice of the Beggar King and begin the painstakingly slow process of scraping together barely enough coins to buy one ticket, thereby receiving an **introduction into the game economy** system.

**Player experience**

* Being thrust into the bustling train station following the gruesome murder should leave the player feeling like a **fugitive on the run** trapped in limbo, eager to depart but forced to pretend everything is normal.
* The indifferent reality of the train station will provide a **contrast to the post-murder** emptiness, a reminder that the world is still moving in its tracks. The clocks are still chiming. People are drinking coffee. It's almost insulting. Don't they know someone's world has just come crashing down?
* Time at the station is limited to mere hours, adding to the **sense of impatience** and pressure to move on, so that the player would not lose momentum after the high-action opening Act and fall into a slump. They are still not safe -- this is no time to relax.
* This Act will challenge the Player's **problem-solving abilities,** as finding all the ways to gain passage aboard he train will require speaking to a variety of characters and following up on several strategies.
* This Act will also put the Player's **motivations** at odds with their **conscience**, presenting them with a layered and difficult choice between Little Hercule and Cunoesse. This confrontation sets up Cunoesse's frightening, manipulative nature.
* The Player will be introduced to **Co-operative Checks,** the **game economy,** the **map(s),** and receive a greater variety of items and consumables to experiment with.

# Act 3 - The Journey

**Summary**

*Size:* Large  
*Playtime:* \~3 hrs  
*Energy:* Low  
*Emotional tone:* Mundanity & Temporary Relief  
90% Talking; 10% Action  
80% Comedy; 20% Darkness

*Themes (anything I can read):*  
PINK: Social contrast  
BLUE: *\[Deception?\]* \-> Trip as Peter Pan -> Never growing up

The third Act, entirely aboard the **Azure Sans-Détour** train line, represents a breather in the tension and a break in the overall darkness. Whether they like it or not, Cuno and Cunoesse have no other option but to stay on this fast-traveling metal tube for **three entire days** before they've reached their destination, so they might as well make the most of it. The key character of **Trip the Train Conductor** will serve to induct them into the ephemeral but vibrant social microcosmos of the train, a temporary society on wheels. This is the Act where we have the opportunity to introduce the largest social spectrum of characters, involving the petit bourgeois hops entrepeneurs **Vincent & Agnes**, wrapped up in a (consensual) love triangle with Trip, as well as other train staff and passengers from social groups Cuno and Cunoesse have never had the chance to interact with before, such as a scientist.(?) This Act will contain another **Locust Dream** sequence, as well as one-off sequences like the **Ghost Station, the Biggest Meal,** and **Two Kids in a Trenchcoat**. The catch of the train journey however, which Cunoesse doesn't tell you until you've already boarded, is that the place where you need to get off the train is actually in between two stations. For this, you're going to have to do Trip's bidding in order to have him pull the emergency brakes on the third day to let you off, or you might have to risk jumping off the moving train to move to the next Act.

**Player experience**

* Here we want the Player to relax a little bit and indulge in Cuno & Cunoesse's mischievous and comedic side. The Train is removed enough from both the immediate stress of the murder and from the impending dread of arriving at Hämärä Maa that it is able to have a more **lighthearted** tone than the rest of the game.
* The Player should feel as though they are really covering ground on their journey, as evidenced by the **daily changes** to the Train map and the dynamic **scrolling background**.
* The characters the Player gets to interact with on the Train can be very thematically diverse and unconnected by background or life experience, joined only by this shared journey. These characters can deliver all kinds of stories from all corners of the game world, expanding on **Elysium worldbuilding and lore.**
* **The Man from Jamrock Station** throughline will present the players with a parallel plot which bridges the seemingly unconnected locations of Acts 2, 3 and 4.
* The Player should have the freedom to decide how they will navigate the **special puzzles** of the Train, affecting the fate of Trip and his love affair.
* The location itself should provide enough **exploration incentives** to keep the limited train space feeling fresh, including gaining access to various cars and compartments, new Orbs and situations appearing every day, and people and luggage changing location daily.

# Act 4 - The Doubt

**Summary**

*Size:* Large  
*Playtime:* \~5 hours  
*Energy:* Medium  
*Emotional tone:* Creeping doubt & feeling like an Outsider  
70% Talking; 30% Action  
50% Comedy; 50% Darkness

Arriving in the Fourth Act, Cuno is officially furthest from his home that he's ever been, while Cunoesse is coming nearer to hers than she has been in the years after she escaped, and this *\[distinction?\]* is starting to get difficult to ignore. The presence of **Hämärä Maa** looms over them both, as the fabled archipelago lies just across the bay, across the *\[...\]*. Having disembarked from the Train virtually in the middle of nowhere, Cuno and Cunoesse come upon the **Rhöne-Tréville (Royal) Penal Colony** or **the Tréville**, but most people call it: a *\[...\]* centred around a former Royalist prison-labor camp. Being that geographically *\[...\]* to Hämärä Maa, the small community represents the closest point of contact between the archipelago and the world, participating in the trade of goods, legends and the profitable **psychedelic marrow of an endemic cave fish.** Meeting the locals, the kids will learn about the impending relocation of the surprisingly harmonious community-sustaining prison complex, and the complicated *\[...\]* between the coordinate *\[...\]* of freedom, imprisonment, community and *\[reunion? tension?\]*. They will also begin on their *\[...\]* is a growing sense of dread that Cunoesse got herself into something that is much darker and more morbid than he could have expected. In order to progress to Hämärä Maa to find out for themselves, the kids must *\[...\]*. *\[...\]* they must *\[...\]* Cunoesse's half remembered *\[...\]* family connections among the marrow traders, some of whom are now in the prison, or they might win their way forward with *\[...\]* and sneers, stealing a toy raft from a gang of violent girl children.

* *\[...\]* for the later endgame where Cuno breaks free of the bond.
* The **power balance** between Cuno, Cunoesse and the player's conscience will again be tested as Cunoesse urges Cuno to brutally fight one of the Tréville girls in order to steal her raft.
* The small self-sustaining community will present the player with the opportunity to engage with the **full set of game systems**, including game economy, Thoughts, substances, exploration and multiple-approach problem-solving.

# Act 5 - The Arrival

**Summary**

*Size:* Medium  
*Playtime:* \~2 hrs  
*Energy:* High  
*Emotional tone: \[...\]* & Reality-Twisting  
60% Talking; 40% Action  
30% Comedy; 70% Darkness

After all the fear and the mayhem, Cuno and Cunoesse are finally there: landing on the shores of **Hämärä Maa**, their promised shadow-land. Greeted with the sounds of shamanic singing and solemn drums, the kids will catch the locals in the midst of a **funeral ceremony**, gaining a glimpse into both the cultural practices of the Näkki and the strange and colorful faces of the island's population. The island has changed since Cunoesse has last called it home. Only her impossibly old grandfather remains, and her *\[sins?\]*. She knows she must do one last thing before she can plead to be readmitted into her tribe. Under the pretense of a Hämärän naming ceremony, Cunoesse pressures Cuno into ingesting the **bone marrow** of the **psychedelic cave fish.** As Cunoesse takes on the role of his fucked-up trip shaman, Cuno grapples with the growing clarity that her goal is deeply sinister: to bind him to herself, or kill them both trying. Cunoesse embraces him and throws them both off a pier, pulling him deep under water, triggering the stylish climax sequence of the game: the Underwater Psychedelic Trip. Reality will *\[...\]* as you seemingly sink for an eternity, fighting for your life and your identity as Cunoesse's true intentions come to light - to use the drug to manipulate Cuno into total and irrevocable ego death, and make him believe that he is **Jaakko, the boy Cunoesse killed** in the caves three years prior. That was her plan all along: to bring Cuno all the way from Martinaise to buy herself passage back into her community by replacing what she has broken. All she needs him to do now in order for her plan to work is to play along, \*really\* play along, so deeply that he will never recall being someone else ever again. Their showdown under water will determine whether Cuno will let go of his identity in one *\[...\]*, or if he is willing to kill his other half in order to remain who he is. The Act spins off into **up to five possible endings,** depending on which one of the kids lives, dies or is brainwashed.

**Player experience**

* We want a sense of **culmination** in every way -- the culmination the journey, of finally getting to see what Hämärä Maa is truly like and what Cunoesse truly is.
* This should be a **streamlined sequence**, funneling the player *\[seamlessly\]* towards the end. We want the player to be unable to *\[...\]* the game once they've landed on Hämärä Maa, similarly to how Harry's story spirals tighter and tighter towards its resolution from the moment he steps onto the **Deserter's Island.**
* We want the player to feel as if they are performing **cultural** ***\[...\]*** with an ominous insular community, something like *\[...\]* but with degenerate alcoholics instead of tradwives.
* This is where **everything we've tried to do over the course of the game comes to count.** All the dual-character systems that make the player roleplay as both Cuno & Cunoesse, all the story beats that make the player internalise their respective stakes, all the emotional connection to this feral superorganism, if we can make the player feel like we're making them choose between two halves of themselves, we've achieved what we set out to do. If they feel torn apart, agonized over their choices, we've won.",7,1743817283.0,DiscoElysium,1,1.0,False

I woke up to the soft glow of morning light filtering through the curtains, casting a warm hue across the room. For a moment, everything felt quiet and still—until I remembered.

We’re married now.

The thought brought a small smile to my face as I turned to see you still asleep beside me, your breathing steady and peaceful. It was a simple moment, but it felt significant. The start of something new.

Not wanting to wake you just yet, I carefully slipped out of bed and made my way to the kitchen. Maybe I could surprise you with breakfast—though whether it would turn out edible was another story.

Still, as I stood there, staring at the coffee maker like it held the secrets to marriage itself, I couldn’t help but feel a quiet kind of happiness.


Hi everyone, I am looking to rp as two newlyweds. I would like to include a set of dice or random number generator with random events to make the plot more fun. This would create a set of fun plotlines that really invigorate the story. 

First grocery trip together – They realize they have very different shopping habits and debate over which brand of peanut butter is superior.

Cooking disaster – One of them tries to cook a romantic meal but forgets a key ingredient or burns something.

Lazy rainy day – They stay in pajamas all day, build a blanket fort, and watch old movies.

First big purchase – They go furniture shopping and struggle to agree on a couch or dining table.

Surprise date night – One plans a surprise date, but it doesn't go exactly as intended (maybe they get lost or the restaurant loses their reservation).

Lost wedding ring scare – One panics after misplacing their wedding ring, only to find it in a silly place.

Pet adoption – They consider adopting a pet and visit a shelter, debating over a dog, cat, or something else.

DIY home project gone wrong – They try to assemble furniture or paint a room together, but it turns into chaos.

Meeting the in-laws – A family member makes an unexpected visit, leading to some awkward or funny moments. Here are some ideas for that to add to it.

Game night rivalry – They have a friendly but competitive board game or video game night, and things get hilariously intense.

Morning routine differences – One is an early riser, the other loves to sleep in, leading to amusing compromises.

Holiday decorating – They have different opinions on how to decorate for the holidays, leading to a fun mini-feud.

Surprise gift exchange – They both try to find the perfect small gift for each other and end up with funny or touching results.

Midnight snack runs – They sneak out late at night in pajamas to grab ice cream or fast food.

Anniversary plans gone awry – Their first-month or first-year celebration doesn't go as expected but turns into a great memory anyway.",1,1743817188.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

Thy theory is that the body takes toxins that it does not have a immediate way to handle and tucks them away in the Lipoma.   

Reduce Fatty and Processed Foods  
Limiting foods high in unhealthy fats—like fried foods, processed meats, and full-fat dairy (e.g., butter, cheese, ice cream)—may help prevent excess fat accumulation in the body. Some suggest that cutting back on these could slow lipoma growth, though this isn’t proven. Switching to lean proteins like chicken, tofu, or beans instead of red meat might also be beneficial.

* Increase Antioxidant-Rich Foods Fruits and vegetables high in antioxidants—such as blueberries, raspberries, leafy greens, and bell peppers—can support overall health and may help reduce inflammation and fat buildup in the blood. These foods also aid in detoxification, which some believe could influence lipoma development.
* Incorporate Omega-3 Fatty Acids Foods like salmon, tuna, and mackerel are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory properties. These might help limit the growth of fatty tissues under the skin by reducing inflammation and supporting fat metabolism, though direct evidence for lipoma reduction is lacking.
* Cut Back on Sugar and Alcohol Excess sugar in the bloodstream can be converted into fat, potentially contributing to fatty deposits. Similarly, alcohol provides ""empty"" calories that may increase fat storage when consumed in large amounts. Reducing both could help manage overall fat levels and support liver function, which processes toxins and fats.
* Focus on Whole, Organic Foods Switching to organic whole grains (e.g., brown rice, quinoa, barley) and minimizing processed foods with preservatives and additives might lighten the load on your liver. A healthier liver could, in theory, better metabolize fats and reduce the likelihood of fatty lumps forming, though this is speculative.
* Stay Hydrated Drinking plenty of water helps flush toxins from the body and supports metabolism. Some suggest adding lemon juice to water for an extra detox boost, but this is more of a general health tip than a lipoma-specific remedy.
* Anti-Inflammatory Diets An anti-inflammatory approach, like the Mediterranean diet (emphasizing fruits, vegetables, fish, olive oil, and whole grains), might indirectly help by reducing systemic inflammation. While inflammation isn’t a proven cause of lipomas, some theorize it could play a role in their development.      ",1,1743816950.0,Lipoma,0,1.0,False

Johnny Torts, fire-eyed, bandana-hearted, barking behind the bench like a junkyard prophet, is gone—fired, they say, but no, not fired—released like a fox from the henhouse, mid-rampage, feathers still flying in the wind.

They say Danny Briere did it. They whisper his name like a card sharp who’s up five hands and playing the long game. The fans still remember his wrist shot poetry in overtime. Now he’s in the front office, not with a stick, but a scalpel—cutting the crust off the Flyers’ stale sandwich, trimming fat off a franchise that’s been chewing its own tail since Lindros lost his helmet.

Torts was the anger, the snarl, the late-night rant at a Wawa with a black coffee in hand and a cigarette clenched like a secret. He was Philly in a hockey sweater—loud, wrong, proud, right. But the Flyers, God bless 'em, they’re trying something new now, maybe. Maybe Danny sees the chessboard twelve moves ahead and we’re all still reading box scores like horoscopes.

The rookies get ice time. The vets get cold looks. The fans get restless and Briere—he’s quiet, but there’s a storm behind those eyes, a Quebecois gale-force wind blowing spreadsheets and scouting reports into something slick, something sleek, something that might actually make sense someday.

Was this the plan? Fire Torts mid-build? Mid-battle? Is this a retool, a rebuild, or a renaissance sculpted in the shadows of the Spectrum’s ghosts? Maybe Briere isn’t just rolling dice. Maybe he’s playing 4D chess and the rest of the league is still setting up the board.

Either way, Torts is gone. The bench is cold. The future is loud.

And Danny?
Danny’s already making his next move.

I value thoughtful discussions around this, including diverse perspectives, which ultimately lead to genuine connection.

When I'm not listening to audiobooks, I'm scrolling through socials. I love going on nature walks. I also enjoy discovering new places, dining out, and meeting people. I'm into health and fitness, and I equally spend a considerable amount of time Googling recipes, meal prepping, or tailoring my workout. I'm open to discovering new hobbies.

I would love to connect with a man who is intellectually curious and thoughtful. Quiet, introverted men have always been my Achilles' heel. Though nowadays, I equally find myself drawn to men who are self-aware, considerate, and who value vulnerability and connection.

If the above describes you, and you are single, unattached, 32yo+, and UK-based, I'd love to hear from you. I'm not particular about your looks, height, or occupation. For reference though, I am Black, BBW, 5""5, and I work in the health care industry.

I'm open to moving things to Discord when we both feel comfortable, exchanging pics, voice notes and having phone calls. And just as well, meeting up at some point, for a coffee, a walk, or new activities we might both find interesting to see if there's potential to move things further along. I'm based in Buckinghamshire County.

Preferred Conversation Starters:
If using one of these, you can skip the hi.
1. Is it healthier for a relationship to have a clear leader or be egalitarian?
2. Is it ethical to use gene editing to enhance abilities in embryos?
3. Can war be justified?
4. Is it more likely that intelligent extraterrestrial life would be benevolent or malevolent to humans?
5. Should marital success be measured by the longevity of a union, or its quality?
6. What crazy dictator things would you do if you were the supreme leader of a small country?
7. Should AI have rights?
8. If you could possess a famous (living) person's body, and mind by extension, whose would you take over?
9. Should nations be held accountable for atrocities committed by previous regimes?
10. If you were offered a pill that would increase your intelligence twofold but give you permanent, lifelong and irreversible ED, would you take it? ",0,1743816604.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. 

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. 

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop.

I’m not interested in ever being friends after this. I don’t deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"". 

If he ever comes up to me to try to ""talk"", what should I do/say?",2,1743816540.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

	Imagine a world that is completely flat. One that the flat earthers had actually gotten correct. But instead of humans with 3-dimensional surfaces roaming around as superior species, it is instead filled to the brim with shapes and lines of all different sizes and colors, but with a strict hierarchy of how they may live. This world is the second-dimension. Many people get it wrong, and may write the wrong story of how it all happened, (not pointing fingers) but the facts they have gotten absolutely and PAINFULLY correct. If you want to get very deep, this place is called Euclydia, and was home to many shapes and lines that lived oblivious to the outside world of hospitality to different places. Dimensions. WORLDS. I have no clue why it was called Euclydia, but it was called that, and that may be the title we should use. 
	I have come to know that many of you have heard a shorter, more simplified version of the story you are about to read and hear, in many ways, and especially by the shape who destroyed this world that innocents lived among. I am one of the lucky few who had lived to write this story of what had actually happened, and how I am still here today. I preserve that you may be able to hear the full story of everything, of his story, and my story, and how they intertwined into an unstoppable 
Feat that destroyed  almost everything that I’ve ever known and loved.
	To get a better understanding of Euclydia, you must know the hierarchy of shapes and what it means.
	
	Triangles
	Triangles, having the least amount of sides, have been seen at the top of hierarchy, and the rulers of the second dimension. In Euclydia, it is seen as an honor to have less sides, for it is good will to give more space for more servants and a category of less-honorable-shapes. Only one royal family was still alive that day that was very corrupt. One of the family members was the one to destroy everything.

	Circles
	Circles, even though have no sides at all, are seen as a lesser category even though they have no sides at all. It is proven that due to the circumference of a circle, that nonetheless, it is almost infinite, but is cut off and shortened as an excuse, and are in the second category instead. 
	


Alacuta, Euclydia, 
20, 000,000,000 B.C: Tale One: Tale of a Telekinetic Toddler




The ranch twinkles beneath the starlight, and the sky seemed to scream, “I love you,” over head. No. This never happened. This never happened at all. No sky. No stars. Proper poise. Be good. Be kind. Be the girl that your parents want you to be. And that’s when I snatched the locket from the birdie on the fencepost. 
Hi. My name is Glee Mourningstarr and I am 2 years old. Though I seem small, and tiny, I’m not. I am not what you think. I am not just some low-life monster like everyone says. I’m not the Star Demon. I’m not a star. I’m just me. Glee. And that’s all I’ll ever be. Sure enough, you might be asking why my brain works like this. It’s because I’m different. That’s at least what my moms tell me. I’m different in good ways. Not bad. Like him. I’m a good different. Because I’m a good kid. That’s what mama Starly tells me. And because of the prayer that they sent, that’s the prayer that will be sent to me again. And it happened. And that’s why I’m Glee. And only Glee.
 I remember skipping along the green hills that surrounded the ranch, and I remember feeling the ground warm up as the sun started to hit the ranch at an angle that made it seem like it was a fairytale. Amulet in hand, one that I gave to all the birds around me so I could hear the thoughts of others, and back to understand what it meant. I am free. Because I live in Alacuta, with my Ma and my Mom, and they love me very much. And I love them too. My legs skipped across the ground into a sprint, and I made it to the house, stepped up the splintered porch, and into the house that seemed like a bunker. Emerica, my other mom, grew up in Alacuta. Her dad fought in the Naaric war, and she was raised on a military base. She was tough. And that was that. And that’s why I grew up in a bunker-asylum type home. My other mom, Starly, did not like this so much. So she moved away to states all around us, to record birds and decipher what it meant from the ones I summoned.
They were always different.
But the good different.
Like me.
She went away often, so only a few moments I would get to see her. Her personality was like a sweet butternut type of cotton candy. Like a banana bread that she made, hard on the outside, soft on the inside, except swapped. She was sweet this way. And that’s what I love about her different. Her good different. My other ma, as you knew as Emerica, was really like the banana bread. She was like bitter coffee, one that would make you recoil quicker than you could sip, before adding coffee creamer, the sweet side of her. But that was after. And in the middle of the coffee. The inside. She was stern and stiff either way. Hardworking, though, according to Starly. Emerica would work till the 3 suns on horizon point went down, and the moon covered the sky- no, the land. Just the land. And that was her different. As my was, and as Starly was. 
Now, as you know, I’m hard working like Mom (Emerica), and I want to prove my worthiness as a Mourningstarr. So when  I opened that door, you should know that I am gonna get jump-scared with a big, fat-
“GWYNNIE! WHERE THE HECK WERE YOU? WHY WERE YOU OUT THERE WHEN YOU NEED TO BE STUDYING YOUR MANDARIN!” America screeched.
I sighed as I put down the locket.
Study.
No break.
Study hard.
And be perfect for her expectations.
And remember, always have a smile on your face.
“Come ON mom, I’m hungry, can we eat breakfast? Why else would I be outside, if it weren’t for the wait, I would be-”
“MANDARIN.”
“妈妈，如果你现在不给我喂早餐，我就吃掉你.”
“Ha, try that when your mom comes over again, your gonna be deader than the boy when she sees you ate me, now-”
	“Ōlelo Hawaiʻi pupule, ʻōlelo ʻo Ma i ka ʻōlelo haole, no ke aha e hiki ʻole ai iā mākou ke ʻōlelo pēlā, Māmā?!”
“Because that’s her ethnicity and you better respect it, kid.”
“FINE! FINE, FINE, FINE, FINE, FINE! You don’t have to call me kid, cuz I’m not a kid anymore Mom-”
Emerica cuts me off.
“That’s right, because you’re a toddler.”
Something switched off inside of me.
“I might be a toddler…but at least I don’t act like one…like some people…”
America slammed her fist down on the table, the clank echoing through the air.
“What was that?!”
“NOTHING MA!”
	I breathed with a sudden flinch. Emerica softened into a menacing stance.
“Good. Cuz’ if you ain’t doin’ nuttin’, then you’ll be doin’ somethin’, cuz’ you’ll be tilling the farm and herbs today.”
“MOOOO-OOOM-”
“No whining! Now get to work!”
Emerica screeched as she walked over to a steel closet that looked like it could chill spines, and threw a steel rake, like the closet, at me.
“And then maybe…we can go to the park today.”
She said with a snap so soft, but honest, and she took a beer bottle and walked out the door, off the patio, and into Mourningstarr farms.
I grumbled. 
I hated farm work, especially with herbs. But of course, I had my own hope, because of what America said that she thought I didn’t hear.
“And then maybe…we can go to the park today.”
The park.
The park was a gateway to a new world!
	A place where Gwendolyn Avian Mourningstarr could be herself! God, I love the park so much!
And if you're wondering, that’s why I followed America out down past the patio ranch, into the wilderness of herbs, vegetables, wheat, animals, and more.
All because of the park.

Los Equalateris, Euclydia, 20,000,000,000,000 B.C 
“PINKIE UP! LITTLE SIPS, NOT DRASTIC MEASURES OF GULPING LIKE A LOPSIDED ELEPHANT, YOU OAF!”
	5:00 A.M.
That has got to be a new record.
5:00 A.M just to take your pitiful little, “oaf”, of a son to tea lessons. All too soon, I would say. But when your hierarchy stance is tall, you might have to just suck it up, Bill.
“SIP NEATLY, SIP, YOU’RE NOT JUST SOME TYPE OF, RANCHER, ARE YOU?! THEN SIP!”
	I bite back a wince as mom slaps my hands into a cramping position to hold the tea correctly. I just don’t get it. I’m not normal. I see the stars. They don’t believe me. The government (even dad) says it’s illegal, and they take me to take pills from the doctors to convince everyone, I'm ‘normal.’ But I’m not. I see the stars. And I’m on the top hierarchy. So what? Who gives a crap? The public? Well, yeah, I guess they do, since father is the mayor of our world of our second dimension, so why wouldn’t they want to commit treason against me? Just give Euclydia a bunch of knives, and they’ll figure it out. That’s what my parents did for my last two birthdays. Yup. I’m two years old. Toddler, but being forced to hierarchy even though it’s not gonna happen because of my eye. But that’s what happens in our mighty home. Triangle, squares and circles on top, irregulars, multicolors, stars, Naarics, and extraterrestrials on the bottom.
“Good, good, now you’ll be prepared when a rancher tries to be your friend when we move from Los Equalateris to Alacuta.”
Ranchers.
That’s what top hierarchies call the low hierarchies. I’ve heard it so many times, it has been stained into my brain and memory. And now that we are moving to the rancher category to prove to the whole world of our region that just because we are on the top hierarchy stance,  it doesn’t mean that we hate them, (We do) mom is making me learn all the proper manners that way if someone tried to hang out with me…
They won’t.
Lesson #1: Don’t ever hang out with a rancher, even if you live among them. 
After mom made me play some notes and such on the piano, with parts she made me press through to memorize and get perfectly on every try, dad walked through the cascading doors of our large mansion, something we got because, duh, dad’s the mayor of Euclydia. The door slammed, and I raced down the stairs to greet him. 
Out of this entire family relationship, he was the only one that I DIDN’T want to trick into bashing their head in with a piano lid. I hugged him, letting my arms wrap as much I could around him, but of course, he did a better job.
“Hey kiddo,” Dad breathed.
“Hello da-father.” I corrected myself, while gently pulling away, a cringed look plastered on my face. 
“It’s okay kid. You can say that in front of me, just not in front of your mom. She’ll probably kill us both this time. SCALENE!”
	His voice echoed through the halls, as a response came tumbling through as well.
“EUCLID! ARE THE DRIVERS HERE TO PICK UP BILL AND TAKE HIM TO ALACUTA?!?!” 
Dad sighs, and adjusts his tophat, before grabbing my hand and leading me to the door unexpectedly.
“Yes honey bun, I’m taking him over right now…”
He had answered mom wearily.
“GOOD! I want that disgrace out of this house right now- erm, lovely, child…out into the van now! Chop chop, Euclid!” 
My eye widened wider as I replayed what mother had said in my head. Disgrace? Surely, I had one eye and could see things I shouldn’t be able to see, but that shouldn’t mean I’m any….DIFFERENT….then anyone….right?
Dad gripped the side of me ... or…if triangles could have a side/like shoulder to them….eh. He lifted me up and took me in his arms, wrapping me up in a tangle of them once again.
“Come on kid, you heard mom.”
“...”
“Bill, did she scare you?”
“...”
“Bill.”
“...”
“BILL.”
“...”
“BILL CIPHER, answer me, does that croak in the throat scare you?!”
“ALIVE, I’m alive, sorry father, it’s just…”
I point behind him.
Because there was fuming mom.
The doors to the inside of the mansion opened, and a bunch of fancy men in tuxedos, like circles and squares paraded in. One of them looked 3 years older than me, 5, and looked like a purple square. He had one eye too, though, on the side of his face. Downside, he’s not like me. 
As they took me to the limo with the postured, purple square by my side, I heard rampant fighting, and throwing, and crashing from the inside. But the louder, more dominant voice was not masculine. I found a newfound interest at looking at my feet now, and the square did as well. 
The boy held onto a rainbow swirled lolly, and we piled into the limo.
“Hello….” The boy whispered.
“Hi…” I said back. He wasn’t a rancher. I was safe from mom’s fiery wrath of racism.
“I’m Tad. Strange. Tad Strange. Although there's nothing really…how do ya say it…STRANGE…about me…who are you?”
Well, if that eye doesn’t count, then believe whatcha wanna believe, lover boy. I thought to myself while looking into space, well, the air, remember? Space doesn’t exist in Euclydia, according to the government. My brain bubble popped back to reality when he elbowed me. 
“Wait, what?”
“You were gonna tell me your name, remember?”
	“Oh, right. How can you not know me, I’m the mayor's son!”
Tad licked his lolly, and let his eye slowly relax.
“Oh, yeah, I don’t really listen to political biz. My mom put me into the show biz instead, big opportunities when you are on the top hierarchy. Mom made me accompany you on the limo so it’s not awkward for you-”
	“...You're an actor?”
	“Yup. The best in town. And in Euclydia. Or maybe even just the entire dimension-” He giggles, his eye going bright. “I’ve even starred on the Oprah Winfrey show once! I’m so awesome. You gotta admit it….errrr-”
Oh. He was talking about himself so much like a narcissistic brat, that I almost forgot to introduce myself.
“Oh. Bill. I’m Bill Cipher.”
“You gotta admit it Bill, nothing can beat me.”
I rolled my eye playfully, and he laughed contiguously, and of course, it spread to me.
“So you really were on the Oprah Winfrey show for best acting once?!” I shrieked. The limo driver, a lime green double stacked circle, turned to stare at me, putting a lip to his eye, and shushed me. I sunk into the leather seat, and Tad giggled. 
“Yeah. She’s cool. She’s a star.”
The limo stopped immediately, and the driver turned his head toward us slowly again. 
I practically leapt onto Tad, and covered his eye…or whatever the speaking came from.
“SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP, THAT WORD IS ILLEGAL, DON’T SAY IT, OR ELSE WE ARE BOTH GONNA END IN TIMEOUT, OR worse…”
Tad looked at me in fear, and he made the cutthroat symbol. 
Lesson #2: Euclydia doesn’t fear strict punishment for execution, even for the little things.
Thankfully, the limo driver just reared in for a sneeze, and the car keeped on going.
We sat in awkward silence for the rest of the drive, looking out the window at the states as we drove through. Eventually, I had to get off, to the new home, and destination, and I turned a blind eye to wave goodbye to the first boy who ever really wanted to talk to me, almost like a friend. He stared at me, before shaking a no, and turning away. Another cold shoulder. I got those a lot. Even from the ones who I thought liked me. The car drove away, leaving me lonely and alone in a new state of Euclydia. Alacuta.

All for me, and only me to explore.

“To the park! To the PARK!” I  screamed in a charade as Mom followed me down the grassy swamp trail. 
I loved the park. 
Although no one wanted to play any games with me, or even try to be my friend, (because baby I’m a PENTAGRAM)I still enjoy letting out what my mom calls, “my potential energy.” Basically, it’s me letting out my gleeful bursts of energy I hide all day while finishing chores on the ranch. Mom hates when I mess around on chore time. I guess I can see why, it probably is pretty hard to keep a hyperactive child in sync with chores. 
OINK! OINK!
	Oh yeah! I forgot to introduce you to my pig, Pig Pen! 
I’ve kept him on Mourningstarr farms for a few years now. Ma had him as a pet, and when Mom came around, she wanted to turn him into a bacon meal. Luckily, with a few charismatic moves, Ma convinced Mom not too. 
And that’s how we still have the darling Pig Pen with us still today!
And of course, I’ll bring him to the park if I want to.
Because even though he isn’t euclidean, he still is to me.
Pig Pen oinks excitedly as we approach the entrance of the dingy old, broken park.
Perfect.
Just like home.
I approached the monkey bars, and climbed on, wrangling around like a little monkey, like Mom says. 
Mom was sitting on the bench, smoking a cigar, and puffing out slow rings as she watched me.
Kids played around me, and that’s when I saw them. 3 of them. And not just any kids. 
The kids who saw me.
Not Glee.
But the real me.
	The part that actually makes me….different.
I hung at the top, and watched them curiously to see what they were doing. I scoffed as I saw the 3 kids, Cylinder, who was double stacked with ovals, and a Scare Ball cap, being green. Another one, a stunning Naaric, who wore a long dress shirt, and was brown. Lilac. The last one, was someone who actually experienced it more than ever. Jeez Louis. What I could best describe as what looked like a …taco? A pink taco with a party hat. And two eyes. The leader of the group. And they were all surrounding some kid…a triangle? No. Not just any triangle.

A one eyed triangle.


* 	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*
“Doh- QUIT IT!” 
I screamed as they all mocked me. I felt anger siege through me. I’m telling the damn truth! 
Why don’t they believe me…?
“He thinks he is SOOO special just because he is the mayor’s son, but when out in Alacuta, he’s nuttin’ but wrong.” The Naaric girl spat. 
I didn’t get it.
They should be bowing DOWN to me.
After all, I gave them knives, AND the privilege to work on my dad’s basic land. They should be grateful.
“Potato brain probably doesn’t work because he still thinks he’s still in Los Equalateris!” The green one cackled, and the rest joined in in terrifying unison.
They shoved me to the ground, and I dropped my luggage. I came to the park after I got everything set up in my new home to meet new people, and tell them about the stars, not to be shoved around like some piccolo bust! 
The pink, taco looking shape came close. “Listen here, and listen NOW. You think you’re so fancy, and you think you’re so cool and poised because you come to the highest family in the land. You think you’re more important than us ranchers. You think just because your mommy and daddy send us to work out in the fields, farms, ranches and mines to make their broken economy-wise plan make ‘em feel good, that you can just boss us around and tell us things that are even more fake than the hierarchy plan. Well you’re wrong, lover boy. You’re wrong times all the lies your cheatin’-apple tossing double cross cotton lickin’ book burnin’ back whippin’ olive prickin’ short eyed parents had ever told you. Because now that you’re here, your pretty cover-boy face ain’t gonna look so pretty anymore. While, at least with the eye, of course.”
They all laughed as they circled closer. That hurt. Hurt times 63. And now that they were gonna hurt me, I could only brace for the worst backlash punishment my little two-year toddler brain could comprehend. 
“But I’m telling you, the stars, they are real!”
	“Is what he said before we hurt his pretty little-”
“A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a…A-” The Naaric stuttered.
The pink taco sighed. 
“God, what is it NOW, Lilac?”
	Then, it was the green double stacked guy.
 “A-a-a-as…-As-Ast…”
	“OH MY GOD, AND NOW IT’S ZACH, JUST TELL ME BEFORE IT’S YOU TWO ARE THE ONES THAT I VICIOUSLY HURT-”
Taco guy quickly turned around, but from the looks of it, really regretted it. And then, again, like the laughs before they stuttered, screeched-
“A-STAR!!!!”
	I slowly turned around and saw a one eyed, magenta star, with a maroon like french hat, and green on the end of well…whatever those things were. And of course, why wouldn’t the gleeful looking thing be hanging upside down from some monkey bars. She hopped down, and landed on some red boots. Surprisingly, she looked my age. And like me. 
A one eyed star. A STAR!
But like the purple dude, on the side of her face.
Double damn.
“Look, I told you they exist!” I whimpered.
She then, for the first time, spoke, her body defended me from the shivering and terrified bullies.
“Yeah, yeah, it’s me, “Scary girl, the one who burned away half your home, friends and family,” we get it, we’re all ranchers, get over the fact of it. You’re not special, guys. And let’s admit, he isn’t either.”
	Flabbergasted, my eye widened, and my pupil shrunk in shock.
The dudes shrunk, and they looked at their feet.
“And that’s okay. So what if he isn’t special? Who actually gives a shit?”
	The majority raised their hands.
Including little ‘ol me. 
“Wow,” she breathed. “That’s, like, really sad. Nonetheless- look, it doesn’t matter if he is royal, it doesn’t matter if he has- one, eye-” She unmistakably enunciated the, ‘one,’ “He lives here now, and we need to be kind to him. And by the way, potatoes have more energy in their bodies then y’all three slacker-packer tomato factors combined. And that’s all to charge an electronic. They're also the smartest veggie there is, and that’s no doubt. So not only do you call geek attack smart, you also called him athletic, and dunced yourself before even thinking first. Boom. Science. Mic. Drop.”
	I felt my face burn. No one ever complimented me like that. Ever. 
And at the same time, no answer from the gang in front of us.
Until they ran out of the park’s playground, screaming- “A-STAAAAAR-!”, leaving me and the star alone in the park playground. She sighed, and screamed after them- “IT’S ASTAR, you idiots, ASTAR! GET IT RIGHT, OR DON’T SAY IT AT ALL!”
	She walked over to a bench, and crossed her arms, sitting on a bench, with a huff. 
	I followed her, and sat next to her, in awe.
	“Not that Astar is still my name, anyways…” She mumbled.
	I looked at her in awe, eye shining.
	“You’re a star…”
	I mumbled. I was right-
	“Woah, woah, WOAH, I don’t associate with stars anymore, I am NOT a star, don’t EVER call me that, I am a PENTAGRAM. Say it with me, PENTAGRAM. PENTAGRAM.”
	We said it together. 
	“Pentagram.”
	“Good,” she responded. “Anyways, I’m Glee Mourningstarr. My friends call me Glee. That is….if I had any…”
	I looked down again, pitying the girl. 
	Lesson #3: Don't ever talk to or befriend a rancher, even if they seem more than the picture.
	No.
	We're both friendless.
	Alone.
	And in need of someone like each other.
	I extended my hand, and looked her in the eye with a happy, relaxed look.
	“It's nice to meet you, Glee,” I remarked, “I'm Bill. Bill Cipher.”
	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	
“Meet my mama! Emerica!”
I shrieked as I led Bill over to my ma. With one overlook, ma grabbed me, tenseness first heard in her voice. 
“GWYNN, HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS BOY?! I DEMAND YOU TO LEAVE MY DAUGHTER ALONE AT ONCE, YOU, YOU FREAK!”
	The boy stumbles backward, and I gasp at my mother. 
	“MA, HE’S NOT A FREAK! I’m a cyclops, you don’t think that of me ... .do you?”
	Ma looks at me, flabbergasted, before groaning, and pulling me back again.
	“....No, of course I don’t….it’s just….it’s different. He can actually see…the…” She gulps, and nudges towards the sky- well, as much as she could anyways….
I gulped back.
I grab the boy's hand and look Ma in the eyes.
The boy finished the gulp triangle.
	“Well, Ma, if that’s how you feel….if…ergh! I can hear the stars!”
	I storm off with the boy towards the park, and Ma looks at me in disgust and shock. Of course, I couldn’t see her, but…I could FEEL the prickles of her sight on my neck.
	And it does NOT feel good.
	“Sorry about my Ma….she…gets that way about newcomers. Actually, she gets that way about everyone except me. She’s a hater.”
	We both glance back at ma, and she shoots back a mortifying stare.
	The boy shivers.
	“Yup. That’s a hater.”
	“What about your Ma, where is she-”
	“Oh, she’s not here-”
	Just then, a limo pulled in. A pretty fancy one too. All black like the burnt toasts that Ma makes for me in the mornings when it’s time to work the fields, and shiny like the toy weapons she gives me as she trains me for what she calls, “one-day-you-might-need-this-hand-to-knife-combat-skill-when-the-second-
Naaric-war-occurs,”or some crap that her pa taught her after he got home after the first Naaric War. (fought on the Naaric side, if you’re wondering)  I watched as a fancy blue shape and a red one, both triangles, piled out 
the car, more elegant than my mind could comprehend. I saw their expressions, too. 
One overlook at the playground, and I could tell who they were. 
The royal family.
I turned to the boy, and decided to make an inference off of what he’d say. 
“Hey, who is that, they look really-”
“Mom.”
“Huh?”
“That’s my mom. You were…wondering.”
He seemed to wince the last words out in a strain.
“Oh. Wait, wait, wait, wait ... .I knew you were special, but I didn’t know you were the boy!”
“Huh?”
“THE BOY! The boy that everyone knows about, the one who is a cyclops, the one who can see the FREAKIN’-....stars?”
“SHUT UP!” He said, his face flushing. 
“I can’t let mom know that I was telling 
people about myself without her know-
Ing! She’s….very secretive….about me….”
The red one walked over to us two, and 
I gawked unknowingly at how beautiful 
she was. She had perfect sides, she was 
the perfect tint of cherry, as if the hea-
vens saw her as an opportunity to make 
something beautiful out of the leftover
charm they had in a bucket. She turned 
towards the boy, and hugged him like he was 
the last thing living in this world. 
In a speculated  and refined tone that reflected 
a gruff British accent, she had an outburst.
“OH SAINT HEAVENS, BILLY, YOU’RE ALRIGHT, LET’S GO TO OUR NEW HOME NOW, other than…this ... .pigsty….”
	I could tell she really enunciated that last word.
	Pigsty.
	Because of us RANCHERS. 
	It made me want to SPIT.
	After smothering the boy with a hug, she turned to me, looked me up and down like she did to the park earlier, and immediately spat out words that I got all the time. 
	“Who is this little narc, and what’s she doing around you, Bill?”
	The boy turned around from the hug, and reached his hand out to me. I smiled a warm smile, or, what I think was a smile, never can really tell, and reached to his hand as well.
	Before the fancy class woman slapped my hand away.
	“Sweetie pie, you know and you have always known that you can NOT befriend a RANCHER! Ugh, GOD, we are DEFINITELY gonna give you a long bath when we get home, come along, Bill, we are going hom- WAH!”
	All of a sudden, another hand slapped the lady before taking the boy home. 
	I could recognize the power in enough time to know who it was. 
	It was-
	“MA! What are you doing, if he has to go home, then he has to go home-”
	“NO! This big brat insulted you, and no one insults MY daughter! NO ONE INSULTS A MOURNINGSTARR!”
	The lady stopped walking away, and the boy turned towards me once again.
	The lady, in a low, menacing voice spoke softly, but you could tell she met BUSINESS.
	“Did you say...Mourningstarr?”
	Ma took my hand, and pushed me behind her.
“Hello, Scalene.”
The air was so thick, you could cut it with a knife.
It only got thicker when the lady responded.
“Hello, Emerica.”
Ma laughed, which only made me grateful to be able to hide behind her even more.
“Wow, look who finally came crawling BACK for more…old friend.”




*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*

	I don’t know exactly what is going on, but I do NOT like it. I honestly have been in a tangle of spaghetti, (my favorite food) since I met this Glee girl. First she shook my hand and made a deal that she’d always be my friend if I promised the same. Next, she showed me around the park to show me who to become friends with, (if I can, no joke, she is BRUTALLY honest) 
and who to silently avoid. Then, she told me about how much birds love to follow her, and sometimes just appear. This was the tip of the iceberg of my confusion. Then, she showed me her mom. Then mother appeared out of nowhere. And now apparently, our moms are enemies
with each other! (at least, that’s what I think, according to what mother says about tone of voice) 
	Just one question: What the HELL is GOING on?!?! (Excuse my profanity)
I turned to Glee, who shared my same confusion, and then I turned to Mother, who seemed to be fuming in frustration. Well, at least what I thought was mere frustration.
“WHAT THE HELL EMERICA, IT’S BEEN 4 YEARS, AND ALL THE SUDDEN YOU COME CRAWLING BACK TO ME LIKE ALL OF YOUR RANCHER ALLIES THAT YOU HAVE BEEN LEFT IN THE DUST!” Mother turns to me, lowering her voice into a whisper- “And for good reason too,” She snickered, and I guess that is what she met for triggering a snicker from me as well. So in order not to be hurt by her dangerous wrath, I went along and snickered like a wicked wizard as well. Although everyone could tell that my giggles were a sham, out of the corner of my eye, I could see Glee, sulking as if she was betrayed by her most beloved friend in the world. 
“Scalene, you know why I had to leave, I did it for my family-”
“Correction, your FUTURE family. You left our….friendship to go be with that stupid little freakshow of a mistake Charly-”
“Starly.”
“Starly, who whatever that bitch’s new name is- however, you knew we had a chance for our dreams. But you gave up immediately for that lady, and now you come crawling back to me after such a short time, just as I speculated. And you barely made a family too. Just a little girl with one eye, who probably gets picked on more than usual. And not for the eye, for the parents instead.”
	Glee winces, recoiling in embarrassment, as far I could see. 
“Correction back at you, Mrs. Cipher, you came crawling back to ME in MY town, in MY home, your son to MY daughter, and to MY park. And for the record, your boy has one eye as well, more deformed then Glee, if I may say so myself, so you better mentally prepare him for the bullying he is about to endure. And ain’t no one saving him.”
Glee looked up at her Mother, and I could see the confusion in her eye.
“Ma, what do you mean?”
Emerica looks at Glee.
“I mean, we’re going home, and we’re leaving your silly little friend behind. Say goodbye to Bill. It’s gonna be the last time you’ll ever be able to, too.”
Glee looked horrified, but she couldn’t resist when she started pulling on her wrist, tugging her in the direction away from me. 
	Emerica looks at Scalene in her eyes one more time, a loss of hope reflecting. 
“Get out of my town. And don’t come back.”
	And with that Mother starting dragging me away, both Glee and me kicking and screaming. 
And then we never saw each other again.

My partner and I both work from home, and over the past months, I’ve been quietly amused and impressed watching her scribble down lyrics during coffee breaks or random quiet moments. I never really expected anything from it – it was just her thing.

But recently, we decided to try bringing her songs to life using AI-generated music. The process has been surprisingly smooth and fun. Her lyrics and melodies came together with a nice sound, and we ended up releasing a few of the tracks on Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music.

It’s been a rewarding little project and something we’re really proud of. I just wanted to share it with you all – maybe some of you will enjoy the vibe or find it inspiring if you’re into music or creative projects.

1jrs209,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jrs209/should_i_be_upset/,Should I be upset,"So I spent 10 days at the place where I babysit overnight and everything I was there deep cleaning since the kids Nana was visiting for dinner on Sunday. She lives near them but it was her first visit and it was important to the mom it be clean. 
I could have gone home on the bus I have a bus pass while the kids were at school But I was also there to help with the kids while the mom studied for the state insurance exam. So I helped clean when I was there and figured it was easier to clean when they were in school and I chose not to go home when I completely could have that was my option. 

On Friday night they stayed the night at their Nana's house and I figured we could use the time to get some bigger stuff done together because between studying and running errands while they were at school there wasn't really a lot of time for her to help during the week. 

She had said she wanted the TV in the living room and I was hoping she would help me clean off the coffee table that she covered with stuff when I asked her to empty a bin full of stuff that I did not know where it went. She basically pulled the pile of stuff out of the bin and put it on the table one at a time saying where it went not making piles continuing even when I left the room so I don't feel like it was my responsibility to put everything away If there was designated piles I would have more than happily picked them up and put them where they belong but just a massive mess on the coffee table was not something I was going to deal with. 

This happened when we first started cleaning after I had just cleaned off the coffee table which took an hour and for like 8 or 9 days at this point she never got around to actually putting the stuff away. 

She also has a habit of putting everything on the end table next to the couch where she sits. 

So Friday night comes along we had to make chili because the ground beef in the fridge have been sat out for a few days to thaw and if it wasn't cooked Friday it was going to be thrown away on Saturday. 

So while we're sitting down eating chili we're talking about what we're going to get done that night and she says that she wants to go through her scrapbook tote to see what she has since last time she was going to go through it to separate stuff I told her I already did that. I don't think her actions that followed were intentional or conscious because I know that she struggles with control issues since she was an abusive relationship for a decade. 

I responded to her wanting to go through totes with why don't we wait till after Nana's dinner so that we're not making a bigger mess to clean in two days time especially because a lot still needed done. 

She kind of agreed but slightly shut down and I didn't notice at first but then I started talking about how she wanted me to move the TV and I was hoping to do that when the kids were not there and she was able to at least be aware of me when I did it like not when she was busy because the TV is very heavy and I didn't want to get hurt without someone spotting me basically even though she's on a weight limit basically if I fell I wanted her to be there just in case. 

So she says yes I will clean the coffee table and end table and I did not do the part of explaining that it was her mess but it really was entirely her mess because the entire time I was there every time the kids would bring toys or their own belongings into the living room I would send them into the family room with it because that is their space they know they are expected to keep that space clean but it would not be fair to them for them to clean up a massive pile of their mom's cutter just because they dropped a few toys in the living room so I made sure they did not add to the mess that she made in the living room. 

And then nothing ended up getting done that night because I was there to help not enable and I don't help until the person I'm helping gets up and starts doing things especially that night because she had time and no excuse not to help. 

Saturday morning she was leaving with her dad to go to an hour away to visit her work that she'd have to go to once a week if she passes the state exam because he drives bus and it was easier for him to take her to see the best route to get there. 

She was expecting to be back my noon but I predicted it would be an all day ordeal. Before she left she was putting a bow in her hair and when she opened the pack she ripped the cardboard and put it on the end table adding to the mess that I was planning to clean up that day even though it was her mess that she said she was going to clean the night before. Then she did a little dance type movement exclaiming how much energy she had that morning which hadn't been common because of her taking a couple falls recently which is another reason why she couldn't clean herself that week. 

I'm also on new medication and I didn't realize until later that day that I had a blood pressure spike but I fell uncharacteristically irritable that morning and for some reason hyper focused on the fact that she was energetic and still adding to the mess when she had literally two feet away that was a bathroom with a garbage can in it or she could have went into the kitchen both of them were the next room over on either side of her and instead she decided to add to the mess that she was supposed to clean the night before. 

I kind of shut down so I wouldn't say anything and mind you this was the day before her mother's dinner she noticed my shutting down and didn't understand what was going on because if I said anything at that point again I don't know why I was so irritable I usually am not that resentful or petty but I completely shut down because I felt like I was going to scream at her if I didn't. After she left she texted me saying that she was sorry if it was something she did and she was going to try harder to help out since she hasn't been able to. 

I know that she's been in a lot of pain but I also feel like maybe she's making excuses too because I get not being able to help out with rib contusions and a pulled muscle in your back put on a 10 lb weight limit not being allowed to reach too high or bend but tell me how when you're hyper in an upbeat mood you're not able to help out enough to throw away your garbage. 

So I took everything that was on the floor that did not belong there and I took everything that was on the surfaces such as the coffee table and end table that did not belong there and I put it in the floor of each of the three downstairs carpeted rooms and I did not clean it. I basically just put her mess more in her way So she was more likely to see it and clean it before her mother came the next day. I still didn't say what was bothering me. Going home for two days really helped though.

Dry shake vigorously for 1 minute, then wet shake until ice cold. 

**Step 4:** Building the drink

Pull the Zabaglione from the fridge and drip about half into a Collins glass. Using a straw, pour the espresso into the grass, followed by a double strain of the Gin Fizz into the glass. Using the straw, slowly top with tonic water - and walla! An Espresso Zabaglione Gin Fizz! Top with some ice if you'd like, stir, and enjoy!

It is rather delicious, but even more labor intensive than a Ramos Gin Fizz - for those masachists out there. 

I'm not sure if it's the yolk in the Zabaglione, but it didn't fizz as much as I thought. Typically the crema in the espresso will fizz up a fair amount on just an espresso tonic, so I'm thinking it has to be the yolk running interference.

Not when you're Muslim. Not during the Trump years.

See, in America, it’s not always “love conquers all.” It’s “love conquers all… pending review, background check, and a biometric scan of your soul.” They don’t believe in romance unless it comes with W-2s, joint tax filings, and a picture of you two brushing your teeth together while holding up today’s newspaper like hostages proving you're still alive.

And our case? It wasn’t your textbook rom-com green card case. We didn’t date. We didn’t meet at a coffee shop and lock eyes over overpriced lattes. We’re Muslim so we kept it halal. We met online, spoke with purpose, prayed on it, and two days after she landed in the U.S., we had our religious marriage. No slow-burn courtship, no candlelit Tinder dates. Just faith, nikah, and a whole lot of awkward stares from people who think love only counts if it includes premarital sex and shared Spotify playlists.

Three months after that, we had our legal wedding for the government’s sake, because Uncle Sam doesn’t recognize a contract unless someone signs it under the gaze of a state seal. Fast forward, and we now have a son; beautiful, wild, and the living proof that yes, this is a real marriage. But somehow, even with a child, a home, and years of shared life under our belt, we still had to prove we weren’t conning the nation.

Because under the Trump regime, love wasn't presumed. It was interrogated.

So yeah, we applied. And we braced ourselves. Because when your marriage is religious, your timeline doesn’t look ""normal"" to the feds. When you’re Muslim, everything that’s sacred to you gets cross-examined like you’re on trial for loving the wrong person in the wrong way at the wrong time.

And this wasn’t just any era; this was the Trump era. That special time in history when ICE vans prowled neighborhoods like Uber drivers with arrest warrants, and Muslims were treated like walking red flags. You’d cough too loud in an airport and find yourself on a no-fly list. You’d Google “Palestine news” and suddenly your Wi-Fi slowed down like the feds were watching your router. We were living in a time when green cards weren’t immigration documents; they were golden tickets. And the chocolate factory? A soul-crushing labyrinth of suspicion, paperwork, and interviews designed to make you question if your marriage was real, even when you were holding hands and raising a baby together.

We weren’t just applying for a green card; we were trying to convince the U.S. government that two Muslims could be in love without it being some kind of elaborate terrorist cover story. That our marriage wasn’t a front. That we weren’t plotting to overthrow the Republic from the kitchen table while arguing about who forgot to buy diapers.

It was like trying to win a reality show with the prize being: “Congratulations, you get to stay with your wife!”

And every day leading up to that first interview felt like we were walking on eggshells made of glass. What if they dig too deep? What if they find that one time you retweeted a post calling Netanyahu a war criminal? What if your child’s name sounds too foreign? What if you smile the wrong way in your ID photo?

This wasn’t immigration; this was immigration under suspicion. And we were just trying to survive it, one step at a time.

But fine. We hired a “lawyer”, and I use that term loosely, like people say “rapper” about their cousin who freestyles in gas station parking lots. I’m pretty sure she got her law degree off a Groupon, printed it at Staples, and framed it next to a cracked dreamcatcher. Her vibe was a chaotic blend of expired public defender and auntie-who-knows-a-guy. Zero professionalism. The kind of person who'd show up to court in flip-flops and blame Mercury retrograde for losing your file.

Still, we paid her. Because we were desperate and naïve and figured something is better than nothing. (Spoiler: it wasn’t.)

First interview comes around. We’re dressed like we’re meeting the Queen of America, clutching our binder of “yes, we’re actually married” documents, photos, leases, baby footprints, everything short of blood samples and a mixtape.

And then, five minutes before the interview, she calls.

“Hey... my car broke down. I’m not coming.”

No apology. No reschedule. No backup attorney. Just pure “oops” energy like she forgot to feed her cat.

Honestly? We were relieved. That woman radiated such ghetto chaos, I’m convinced if she had shown up, she would’ve walked in late, chewed gum during the oath, and called the officer “girl” before handing over a CVS receipt instead of our packet.

She seemed like the type who’d say, “They’re in love, your honor, I mean, officer, wait, what room is this again?” and then offer the immigration officer a bag of Hot Cheetos as supporting evidence.

We fired her the next day. No refund, of course. Just a $2,000 reminder that you do get what you pay for; especially when what you pay for is a walking red flag in acrylic nails and fuzzy slippers.

So we went in alone. And alhamdulillah, the officer was chill. We walked out like, ""Hey… maybe that wasn’t so bad?""

But then came the letter.

Second interview scheduled.

And that’s when the anxiety kicked in. See, second interviews aren’t just follow-ups; they’re interrogations. They separate you like criminals on Law & Order and ask things like “Which side of the sink does your wife leave her toothbrush on?” and “What’s the color of the rug in your bedroom, down to the fiber?”

And now we had no lawyer. In the Trump era. When Muslims were getting flagged for blinking sideways and immigrants were being disappeared for daring to speak against the Empire.

To make it worse, we started spiraling: What if they saw one of our old social media posts? You know, something totally reasonable like “Israel is committing genocide and we shouldn't fund it?” Which, in normal human society is just an obvious truth; but in Trump’s America, that’s grounds for “detention without trial until the embassy forgets you exist.”

It felt like a black cloud hovering over us. Like Zionazi Big Brother was watching through a ring camera taped to a settler’s forehead.

So we prayed. Ramadan had just passed, and we made du’a like our lives depended on it ; because they kinda did.

Then the day came. We showed up to USCIS again, dressed like a clearance-rack version of power couple energy; me in the nicest shirt I don’t wear to mow the lawn, her glowing like the Hijabi queen she is even under fluorescent trauma lighting. We stepped into the waiting room and took our seats in the purgatory of American immigration: that liminal space where relationships go to be judged by people with clipboards, headsets, and zero chill.

And then we waited. Two hours.

It felt like sitting in a DMV built by Kafka and ICE. Couples shuffled in and out. Everyone looked pale, stressed, twitchy; like a TSA line for broken hearts.

And we watched.

Some couples were obviously in love; you could feel it in their body language. There was this older American guy with his sweet Filipina wife; they looked like they’d been through some stuff together. You could tell they were nervous, but real. Another one, an American dude and his pretty Russian wife, sat close, whispering to each other with real warmth, the kind you can’t fake with flashcards.

Then there were the others.

Like this young, model-tier African guy; fresh haircut, tailored shirt, looking like he just stepped out of a cologne ad, holding hands with a woman who looked like she’d just wandered out of a Motel 6 meth bust. No shade, but she had that jittery, teeth-missing, been-up-for-three-days energy. You could practically see the fraud charges hovering over them like cartoon stink lines. No eye contact. No warmth. Just vibes... and not the good kind.

Then came the lesbian couple.

One was Ethiopian, visibly nervous, hands shaking, eyes darting around the room like she was waiting for a trapdoor to open beneath her chair. She wore a grey shawl and sat stiff as a board, looking like she was either about to cry or pass out. If she was a lesbian, she was doing a hell of a job keeping it hidden. Maybe it was buried under layers of pure existential dread.

Her ""wife"" was something else entirely; African American, butch, built like she fought bouncers for sport. Tank top, scowl, that wild, don’t-test-me energy. She looked like she hadn’t been in a good mood since '99 and wasn’t about to start now. The vibes? Immaculately confrontational.

We didn’t see their interview, just heard the aftermath.

Suddenly the door flew open, and the ""wife"" stormed out like she’d just been personally insulted by the Constitution. The immigration officer followed her, clearly caught off guard.

He called out, “Ma’am, are you really leaving?”

She spun around, full attitude: “Am I allowed to go outside? You got a problem with that?”

Then she marched off, muttering something under her breath, barely glanci g at her ""wife"" and leaving the Ethiopian woman behind looking like she wanted to evaporate on the spot.

You could feel it in the air; that interview was toast. You could practically hear the file being stamped DENIED from the waiting room.

And there we were. Watching it all like spectators at a slow-motion car crash, hands sweaty, hearts pounding, wondering if we were next.

Meanwhile, we just sat there. Holding hands. Whispering little jokes. Stress-laughing. Squeezing each other’s fingers in that quiet way married people do when words aren’t enough. Real love under government surveillance.

We weren’t trying to convince anyone; we were just being us. And somehow, in that strange zoo of desperation, bad acting, and genuine devotion, we realized something:

We might’ve been the only couple there actually vibing like a couple.

And that’s when they called our number… ""L 11...""
We walked up like lambs to the bureaucratic slaughter, ready to be separated and grilled about our toothpaste and grocery receipts.

The officer looked at us, tapped a keyboard, then said:

“Yeah… never mind. We actually don’t need to interview you again. Scheduling mishap. You guys are all good.”


We stood there like: excuse me? After all that? After two hours of stress-induced internal organ decay?

No second interview. No questions. No lawyer. No Zionist black site.

Just… a glitch in the matrix.

Maybe they reviewed our file again and saw we had a child together and thought, Yeah, probably not fake.
Maybe they were just swamped that day and needed to clear a couple files off the desk.
Maybe the officer was eavesdropping on us with one of those fancy directional microphones, heard us bickering over whether our baby pooped or farted, and thought, This is definitely a real couple.
Maybe our two-hour wait was secretly a vibe check; and we passed just by sitting there, half-annoyed and half-in-love like any other married couple.
Or maybe, and this is the one I believe, Allah changed our destiny because of the du’as we made in Ramadan, cracked open the heavens, and sent mercy disguised as a scheduling mishap.

We walked out half-laughing, half-traumatized, whispering “Alhamdulillah” like survivors of some bizarre reality show.

It’s not approved yet, but we feel like Allah sent that angel of chaos to misclick a spreadsheet just for us. Because when you pray hard in Ramadan, even the darkest clouds can part.

Sometimes, divine mercy looks like a scheduling error.

1jrrxj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/union/comments/1jrrxj3/security_guard_unions/,Security guard unions?,"Hey friends,

Right of the bat, I'm not a security guard. I'm an IATSE Stage hand. 

Tonight I overheard a security guard talking about his shift. He was saying that he likes the venue we were at because theyre kind to him, let him take breaks, things like that. He went on to say that many of the venues he works at, hes required to work multiple back to back 16 hour shifts, with no meal break. He'll often get dressed down for taking a bathroom break, and isn't allowed to use other amenities on site (refrigerator/microwave/coffee maker/etc ).  He's literally expected to stand still in one spot for 16 hours, and God help him if he moves. 

I heard enough that I felt compelled to go talk to him about it.  He was the only guard on tonight, and seemed to feel safe talking to other venue employees (security guards are all contracted from an outside firm, not the venue itself). I brought up unionizing with his guard coworkers, and he'd said he thought about it, but was afraid to bring it up, which I completely understand. I did some Google searching with him, but couldn't find a union that specifically said it was for security guards. Maybe my google-fu is weak, but I was finding butt loads of Information on police unions, but I wouldn't think they would accept non police security guards?

Anyway, my question is, is anyone here in a security guard union?  Possibly in the central PA area?  I'd love to be able to pass more info on to this guy, or connect him with someone who can help him more, but I'm not sure where to point him.   His description of his working conditions was just so horrendous, I felt compelled to help in any way I could. Nobody should be afraid to take a bathroom break during a 16 hour shift!

I hope you can use this to learn something new, but most of you are going to scoff and ignore this because you can't see outside your perspectives. But if you think you like facts, then break out your goddang pencils and start taking notes, because I'm about to hold your hand and walk you through what Fi is once and for all. **If you can't figure it out after this, you can never claim to think with logic.**  
\*ahem\*.

""History is written by the Victors."" - Winston Churchill.

Well, *you* can argue who wrote it, but *I* don't really care. This is a quote I think about a lot and internalized since the first time I heard it in, like, middle school. If you know history, you'd recognize it, and you know it's true too; everyone whose gone through academia has probably experienced some type of lecture that discuss bias in historical documents.

""Primary source is the best, secondary if you *have* to, but the more filters it goes through the blurrier the facts get, so try to mainly stick to those two when you go off to write your papers. But remember: **the primary source might not even be an accurate telling of what really happened, since everything that was ever written was from the perspective of someone with biases that they might not even realized were there.""**

It's something all Journalists have to understand. Sociologists too. People who do anything related to groups of people. **Bias.** I don't know if you've been following AI development, but even AI results have biases written into its code. It's hilarious to see, but let's be real: you could have expected it from a mile away! Or, at least I did. I know I'll never buy into AI except to make it do shit like fix my grammar, because it's impossible for it to not be bias due to the hands from which it was made. **People.**

""But all of these are facts!"" You might say. ""What does that have to do with Fi?""

Actually, maybe some of you picked up on it already. I'm not going to discredit intelligence. But let me break it down to you anyways, in case you blink and try to miss it:

**Fi is about understanding the logic behind people.**

Fi is objective in that every single person on earth will experience, or has experienced, the same emotions. Loss, love, hate, anger, sadness, *anxiety, joy, excitement!!* **Apathy.** You know it, I know it, everyone knows the 8 things I just named above, and then some. Everyone whose ever done shit has done shit because something else made them *want* to do it. That's a fact. And Fi wants to intuitively understand *why.*

The facts can change when history shifts, and if you know history, you know it too. But people never change. We all have brains, and every brain has the same parts, and those parts + personality + experiences can make them inclined to yell when they're angry, or get cold when they're angry, or have *some emotional response that they do in reaction to stimuli;* but everyone does it. That's an objective fact. **Understanding that fact is Fi.** I didn't even recognize Fi in myself because for me, it's only ever been objective. I use logic and I use facts to intuitively try to understand how information can affect myself and other people, how it can make others think, what they think of it, what's their experience with it; and that's the first thing I prioritize when I come across new information. That's an objective Fi value.

The only reason why anyone says it's subjective is because they see ""feelings"" and think they know what it is. It's subjective, *of course it is,* because everyone experiences feelings differently. Which, sure. You can argue that. But isn't it the same for thoughts? intuition? *sensation?* Fi is subjective in the same way. And it's also *logical* in the same way, grounded in reality the same way that Si makes us enjoy coffee, or feeling the sunshine against our skin. Or maybe you hate it and think you're going to get skin cancer when you go outside, because you're really pale, like \*really\* pale, and you need your SPF 70+ because you don't want to risk-- You're good. Go get your sunscreen. That ain't me, but I appreciate you. I'll just wait for you outside.

The idea Fi values inherently aren't objective because they're based in *feelings* is a deeply very misguided one. There's no such thing as a subjective fact. And if you can claim subjective facts aren't real, but can claim that feelings are subjective... Then you have to consider to yourself if feelings aren't real.

But of course they are. That's why bias is something you need to look out for when finding sources for a research paper!!

Your feelings are real, **and that's an objective fact you can't hide.** If you're mad, you're mad, THAT'S an objective fact. If you're sad, then something made you feel sad, and THAT'S an objective fact. Feelings affect how you act, the choices you make; and I love trying to understand that. But pretending that your feelings aren't real is only going to hurt you, and the people around you. Personally, I don't believe you can claim to think objectively until you try and understand your own biases. Emotions. *Feelings.* Try to embrace them for once. That's the only advice I can give you.

At the end of the day, how the data can be used to affect us is all that's really going to matter. You see that happening with the United States media outlets, the damage that can be done. Is it the information being wide spread, or is it the people that's the problem? I'll say this: It's the people, but *they're not the problem*. And that's not a statement based on internal thinking. It's not intuition. It's not sensation. It's a statement that comes from Fi. And when I see people dismiss their feelings in favor of some bullshit ideology that ""feelings aren't real"" I see someone who can't recognize themselves. And that's just real sad.

1jrrumn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jrrumn/24f_new_difficulties_sleeping_after_starting_new/,24F - New Difficulties Sleeping After Starting New Meds/Supplements,"**Patient info**: 24 y/o AFAB, approx 6' and 330lbs, non-hispanic White, USA-based

**Complaint**: Around March 26th, 2025, I began taking several new supplements and one new medication, all but one at the recommendation of a Nurse Practitioner. 

Since then, I have been having terribly unsatisfying sleep, feeling wide awake several times through the night. I usually wake up once to use the bathroom and fall back asleep, and wake up briefly around two other times that I am conscious enough to acknowledge but quickly fall back asleep. Currently, it is not like that. I have been getting up to pee once, having those brief wake-ups around 5 times, and having at least once where I wake up and cannot get back to sleep for at least 30-45 minutes. A few days I have taken longer naps (3 hours average), but I am having the same experience regardless if I do nothing and nap or work 12+ hours and get home tired.

It is to the point that I am struggling at work and college because I am so exhausted throughout the day - I have even gone back to sleep after my alarm for the first two times ever. I have a history of sleep issues, but this was a pretty stark shift at the time of starting these medications. 

**Question**: Should I attempt to identify and stop the cause or wait to see if my body adjusts? If the former, which of the new additions could be the culprit? If the latter, how long should I wait?

**Newly added medications/supplements**: 

* Progesterone (100mg)
* Metagenics Vitamin B-Complex
* Metagenics Vitamin D3 (5000u; switched to this from an off-brand 2000u)
* Nutriflair Berberine+ with Ceylon Cinnamon (1200mg)
* AZO Cranberry (recommended by an RN in the family for semi-chronic UTIs)

I take the supplements in the morning to midday and the progesterone at night.

**Existing medications used**: 

* medroxyprogesterone acetate (depo shot, every 3 weeks)
* duloxetine (60mg - one pill two times daily)
* lamotrigine (60mg, one at night)
* bupropion (300mg, one at morning)
* propranolol (20mg, 2-3x daily, always one at morning and one at night)
* famotidine (20 mg, one at night)
* pantoprazole (40mg, one at morning)
* fexofenadine (60mg, one at night)

**Other notes**:

* I am a heavy daily caffeine consumer, drinking between 400 and 800mg of caffeine from coffee (1 or 2 30-oz cups with creamer) - no other significant sources of caffeine (no soda, rare tea, small amounts of chocolate, etc.)
* I rotate from day to night shift every 28 days, working mostly 12-hour shifts with some 8-hour shifts. This whole issue has occurred while on day shift - waking around 6 am and going to sleep around 9 pm

**Possibly relevant diagnoses**:

* Sleep apnea - mild, but with severe drops in blood oxygen; diagnosed a few months ago; untreated. Have a C-PAP prescription, waiting to hear back from the supply provider. My sleep quality is significantly worse than when I got diagnosed, but nothing outside of the meds mentioned above has changed
* GERD - my treatment has been effective and I have not woken up from indigestion in a while
* Generalized anxiety disorder - same as above, treatment has been working
* Chronic pain (due to back issues) - I have not been waking up in pain, so I do not think this is influencing anything

And while I was enthusiast at first, I feel like I quickly got lost into the ''magpie syndrome''; everything that looked *shiny* was too appealing to pass, and only a quarter into the year do I realise I kinda lost myself. I currently feel completely overwhelmed.

I used to have one deity, would do morning coffee with Her, stick to candles and jars spells with 2-3 bigger spells through the year if needed, and would practice tarot readings a lot in my spare times. A sigil would be used here and there... that's about it. I would use the new moon to clean and cleanse my space and myself, and decorate my altar for sabbats.

But over the past few months I changed my entire dynamic. I started every sitting at my altar (nearly every day) with long incantations, grounding, recentering of energies... which I used to do only when I was doing spells. I now feel like this whole ritual lost its true magick and power because it became some sort of daily repetitive task; also, it feels like a chore most days and I started skipping sitting into my sacred space cuz of it.   
  
I tried connecting with a few new deities to ''compensate'' what my matron seemed to be lacking, and praying / worshipping them. I added poppets magick,  and servitors that I need to ''feed'' multiple times per week. I started doing more complex new and full moon rituals where I kinda sorta feel obligated to do bigger spells than before, since I do more on the daily now that I was doing during the moon phases in the past... same goes for sabbats.

And this morning I thought : this is just too fucking much and I miss the time where I would just plop at my altar with a coffee in the morning to talk to my deity and flip a tarot card or two. And I feel so disconnected from my matron because I have just been busy feeding my servitors, worshipping other deities and shaking my jars and planning moon / sabbats events.

I am trying not to feel bad with the idea of dropping some deities and ending my servitors work but as a chaote I know the idea is that we can do what we want and work with what is best for us, and this has simply gotten too complex. My magick should fit me like a glove and it doesn't... it currently feels more like a burden and an obligation.

So, dear friends. Did some of you had a Chaos crisis as well, and how did you work through it? Did it turn out better to re-embrace your roots or you regretted going back to basics?

*P.S. There is some things I will keep from this experience. Daily evening meditation is one of them. Poppets work on a smaller scale as well.

1jrrs5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/1jrrs5f/finally_a_batch_im_really_excited_about/,"Finally, a batch I'm really excited about!!","I'm getting ready to pair up with a local coffee stand to offer some things through their business and I've been working over and over again on getting my bagel results just right because I REALLY want to include them.

Today's batch finally had a nice rise with a crisp crust and soft chewy center!! I am so happy with them!

It's mostly the recipe published on Perfect Loaf with a bit less flour (because I like them more soft vs chewy) and my best attempt at scaling up the ingredients to make 18 instead of 12.

Levain: 180g bread flour, 90g water, 35g ripe starter.

Dough: 1124g bread flour, 710g water, 44g sugar, 44g barley malt syrup, 26g salt, 10g barley malt powder, levain

I mixed the levain and let it proof overnight then mixed the batch the next morning. I knew that my kitchen aid wouldn't handle all of the dough and I wanted to make a large batch so I mixed 2 half batches separately and then combined them for BF.

Briefly mixed 100g water with the sugar, syrup, powder, salt and levain to dissolve the syrup a bit and start to break up the levain.

Added the remaining water and most of the flour (reserved about 60g from each batch) and mixed on low until the flour was all absorbed.

Once I had both half batches mixed, I turned the dough out on the counter and kneaded in the remaining flour by hand.

BF took 7 hours at 76 degrees to reach about a 75% rise (I use a clear tub and mark the sides so that i can see the progress, it's what works for me. Rubbed a little oil on the inside before BF to help with the turn out) Then I shaped, placed them on a cornmeal dusted sheet pan and proofed on the counter for about 30 min before moving to the fridge to cold proof.

This morning I took them out to proof on the counter for about 30 min before boiling (no sugar or baking soda, just plain water). Boiled for about 80 seconds, turning halfway through.

Baked at 475 for 10 min then dropped the temp to 450 for another 10 min.

Now that I'm confident with the base, the next frontier will be starting to play with adding inclusions!

I know there are easier recipes out there but I love the complexity that sourdough baking can have and being a bit too detailed and playing with all the variables is actually the thing that keeps me coming back again and again.

1jrrrmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jrrrmb/my_coworker_and_i_were_looking_for_the_storage/,"My coworker and I were looking for the storage closet, but got a staircase instead (Part 2)","[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jqj69g/my_coworker_and_i_were_looking_for_the_storage/)

As I began my descent I found that there was dust and dirt on each step, now getting stuck to the bottom and sides of my shoe. Gross, I thought, I guess the guys that did this never came back and cleaned up. 



Once I got to the landing and turned, to my surprise, there were more steps. This case wasn’t more than 5 feet down, but it still struck me as poor planning on the part of whoever designed it. I mean, was it seriously not possible to just extend the room? Before I decided to walk down, I turned and called up to Catherine that things were fine, and there were only a few more stairs, but everything looked good. Leaving the door propped open with a mop bucket, she met me at the landing and we continued. I hadn’t insisted on walking ahead of her, though she all but encouraged me to do so.



At the bottom of the steps there was a large, empty room save for a pile of boxes and power tools, a few piles of strewn-about papers, and oil lamps stuck to the floors and walls. To the right was another hall leading to a lectern, dead ahead from the bottom of the stairs was a door, and to the left was another door with no real light around it. Seeing as the floor cleaner wasn’t in my immediate view, I turned to Catherine.



“Seems like we’re gonna have to take a look around.”



“You got that, right?""



I was surprised to hear this, as up until this night Catherine hadn’t seemed like the kind of person who scared so easily, I was still shocked by her reaction before. She’d always been cool and collected whenever there were rowdy customers at least, but I guess in hindsight that wasn’t a good gauge for how she would react to this. There was nothing even around us though that should’ve made her that nervous.



I took it to mean one of two things:



One, she was testing me. I was supposed to be acting strong in front of her, so she knew I was gonna keep her safe if we went out. That seemed logical at the time.



Two, she was still afraid from before, since these stairs just seemed to appear out of nowhere, and wanted to go back up. That also seemed logical, and more likely.



Going with the first option I took a deep breath and smiled. “We don’t have to split up or anything if you don’t want to. We aren’t some mystery gang.” This seemed to earn me some brownie points as I heard her laugh to herself. Score.



Leading her around the room, we started by searching through the boxes. They were more like storage crates as I got to examine them closer. All but one was empty, housing only some power tools and a burlap sack that folded over itself by the top. It looked like it was full of something, but the smell coming from it was horrible. I opted not to touch it. I turned to Cathy to let her know, but she was halfway across the room from me, staring down the hall that led to the lectern.



I went to call out to her but stopped as I heard what sounded like scraping along the floor to my side. I turned my head as fast as I could but was met with nothing. I swore I heard something dragging itself right beside me. I can still hear the scraping of flesh on concrete. To then be unable to find any trace or signs of a source made me shiver, but maybe it had been something above us. Shaking myself free of the horrors my mind was already making up, I called out to Catherine.



“Anything?”



“Not yet, but I want to go see what’s up with this room. The oil lamps are weird enough, but why would the guys leave the plans down here?”



“So they could ask you to clean up?”



As if those words were enough to bring her peace of mind, I heard her laugh, and once again I found myself lost on her. The light wasn’t great down there, but somehow Catherine had a kind of glow about her. I wanted to say something, anything, but decided that if I did, I might take her out of the laughter, and I’d lose that fluttery feeling in my stomach. The sound of the scraping faded from my mind and was promptly replaced by the giddy chuckles of the woman down there with me. So, I watched her, and as the laughter died down, we were brought back to the basement together. I felt at that moment like maybe I’d never want to leave it in her company. I brought myself back to reality, conceding that I was getting a little ahead of myself. She hadn’t even given me a definite yes. I was losing my cool over a maybe.



“I’m surprised they left anything down here really.” I continued “There’re just some dusty power tools here and a huge sack. It reeks.”

“Sounds like the rest of the store.” Again, that smile. “Would you mind going in here with me?”



Giving a nod in her direction, I strode over and gestured ahead. Catherine stepped in front, and we walked down, however, there were no blueprints on the lectern. It was a book. There was even a large faded sticky note stuck to the space beside it. I didn’t know how Cathy mistook any of it for blueprints, but I chose to ignore it. Sometimes women say crazy things.



“Huh,” she picked it up, dusting the top off, “I’ve never seen plans inside of a book like this.”



“Me either, but I think that's because there are no plans in it. Maybe we should leave it where it was, I wouldn’t want us to get in trouble for touching admin's things.”



“Honestly I don’t think anyone’s gonna mind, looks like they finished building already.”



As she flipped the book open, I repositioned myself in place. I didn’t understand her newfound boldness after her anxiety and astonishment topside. I remember thinking it might've just been a woman thing, they do sometimes say crazy things. Besides, looking through someone else’s things felt uncomfortable when we were only down there for floor cleaner, but I said nothing. It was just us.



To occupy myself I reached out and took the sticky note off the lectern. Scribbled on it was what looked to be a to-do list. I brought it closer to my face so I could make out what was written on it since it was pretty faded and dusty. It read:



\-	prepare living space for next attempt

\-	speak with Apep about Door properties

\-	see about getting key copied

\-	lock the Door



I cocked my head to the side. That definitely confused me. As far as I knew we didn’t have an Apep on the team. I figured someone had lost their to-do list for another job, or it could have been someone from the regional headquarters, either way, it wasn't really my business. So, I stuck the note back where I found it.



Was someone supposed to be living down here? I remember thinking. Why would anyone build a basement apartment underneath here, and who'd want that? 



Cathy scoffed from her place a few steps from me, causing me to perk up and jerk in her direction. I thought maybe she’d seen something funny or possibly was having the same thoughts as me. “Whaddya got?” 



Shaking her head, she didn't reply at first. She came over to me and pointed a finger at the page she was on. It was full of writing on both sides. “It looks like someone was keeping a diary.” She explained.



As I heard this, I placed a hand on the book and pressed it down from her gaze. Her lack of care while rummaging through her higher-up's personal belongings was not something I shared, and I had already gotten the feeling we'd stumbled into something we shouldn't have.



“A diary? Catherine. We shouldn’t be looking through it. If it’s personal, wouldn't we want to leave it for someone else to deal with? I mean, whatever is written in there is not our business.”



“Adrian,” she looked up at me; her expression not as serious as I was sure my own was “look at the date. You don't have to worry.”

I obeyed. As I gazed down at the head of the page I could read the date: May 19th, 1990. That'd been well over 20 years ago. It still wasn’t enough to convince me we weren’t snooping too much, though. “Cool, so this is a super old diary. Good for them for keeping up with it. We should put it down.”



“I don’t think you’re understanding what this means.” Cathy pressed the book to her chest tightly, stepping back from me. “Someone has been living down here!”



There was silence at first, but once I came to terms with the fact that Catherine wasn't joking with me, I laughed. However, I could almost see the desire to figure out this mystery dripping from my friend's gaze. My laughter faltered as I broke through the quiet intensity. “I think that was the point. The post-it next to the book had a list of stuff and a living space was on it. I think this is s’posed to be an apartment, but that’s impossible because there’s never been a basement.”



“That’s true.”



Silence fell between us as we both seemed to be trying to come up with some cause for the place's existence. It was only broken by the occasional sound of the flickering of the oil lamps before an idea was offered by Cathy. “Maybe they took down the back wall and there was just a staircase behind it.”



""You think?""



""I don't know Adrian. I'm just as confused as you, but at least I'm trying to come up with something.""



""That's fair- but I don’t know either. We’re definitely intruding now, though. Wanna just head out?”



“Yeah, I guess we can go. Just lemme see how recent this gets.”



Now flipping through the pages, she seemed to have a newfound interest that had completely replaced the fear. I had expected this the entire time, but to see her have this air about her now felt unnatural. This was not the case for me, and I found myself looking around the room. It was at this point that I started noticing the splotchy paint on the walls and the graffiti that had been spray painted about. There were symbols and words I didn’t understand. I thought I had seen some of them in a video game once, but I had no idea what they meant in real life. I shook my head, looking back at Catherine. In an unexpected twist, it seemed like I was more interested in leaving than her. 



“Aw, that sucks.” She’d now stopped flipping through the book.



“What’s wrong?”



“The last entry is from the same year, in July.”



“Guess they weren’t keeping up then. Bummer.”



“Listen Adrian, this is kinda sad: 



July 3rd, 1990



They’re going to lock me down here tonight for the sleep test. That guy Apep said I should keep a separate journal, so whatever I write doesn’t get mixed in with all the other things in here. They gave me something for the shaking and fever, symptoms of withdrawals they said. I’m just glad to be catching a break. I couldn’t stay out on the street anymore. Hopefully, things only go up from here. I’m sure he will read this, so thank you Apep for the place. I'm infinitely grateful.”



As Cathy spoke, I gave the room another once over.



“So, where’s the other book?”



As I asked, she procured a much smaller composition notebook from the inside of the larger.  “After that entry they mentioned they were gonna tuck the new book into the last page here, convenient huh?” 



I scoffed as she handed it off to me and went to place the other book back onto the lectern. I was apprehensive, but ultimately decided it wouldn't hurt if I opened it up. On the first page I'd found another entry. I read aloud for Cathy:



“July 4th, 1990



I’ve never kept a dream diary or journal before, but I guess it’ll help them with their study. Apep told me to record any dreams I had anyway. I’m just a little shaken up to tell you the truth.



I woke up on the floor just outside my room. Something huge was in my face and called me Lighten. I felt like I couldn’t do anything while it was looking at me, not run, not scream, I couldn't even move my arms. It had a lot of mouths, but none that moved. I don’t know how I was hearing it. Dreams are weird. The thing looked so real. I felt like I could reach out and actually feel it there. Eventually, I was able to move again, so I stepped back and told it my name. It didn’t respond to me. I eventually said something else, and it cut me off, telling me that I wasn’t worthy of some task. I asked it to stop but it kept on going. It said a lot of things. Something about a God born from consciousness and doors through the cosmos. It told me I wasn't worthy; that I'd rot with the rest. I didn’t really understand so I kept trying to stop it, but I guess when it was done saying its piece it just stopped. It just sat there, like it died right in front of me. It started to move again, but that's when I woke up. I was covered in sweat. It was a creepy dream, sure, but I think it must be a side effect of these pills. I’ll ask Apep later. He’s supposed to be coming around noon- not that I can tell when that is down here.”



My only reaction at that point was laughter. “That is crazy. There hasn’t ever been a basement here. This guy must mean a different basement he got locked in, because we’ve only ever had a supply closet up there.”



 “Maybe we should call the owner? Forget the cleaner- let’s go up.”



Still in disbelief, I gestured out to the hall. “Sure, let’s do that. Upstairs. Tomorrow. Come on. I just want to get back to flipping shit.”



In agreement, we both made our way back to the main room. I noticed as we were walking that I still had the notebook in my hands. 



“Should I leave this?” I asked ahead. Without turning around, she shrugged. “I don’t know. Whatever you want.”



I looked around the main room and decided to toss the notebook by the crates I’d looked through earlier. I no longer wanted any part of anything going on down here, and I hoped Cathy didn’t either. I was almost itching to continue talking about where she liked going for coffee or maybe hobbies she had. I just wanted to experience anything more interesting and easier to stomach than the new, dirty, poorly lit basement apartment. As I thought about this and tried to catch up to my companion, I heard that same dragging sound. It was further than before, but still clear as day. Seeing as I had almost a full view of the space and couldn’t see anything that would’ve caused the sound, I summed it up to water pipes or something overhead and dropped it. I made a swift ascent and stopped at the top of the stairs, just in front of the exit with Catherine. The mop bucket must’ve fallen over or rolled back because the door was now closed.



“Forget something?” I asked, looking up as she faced me.



“Adrian I’m such an idiot.”



“What do you mean?”



“I don’t have the key on me anymore, I put it down before we came down the stairs.”



“Oh, well that’s fine. You unlocked it; it should still be open.”



She reached back, and the sound that followed made my stomach drop. Catherine jiggled the handle, but the sound of the door opening never came. It must not have actually unlocked, or maybe Cathy had relocked it on our way down without a key. That wasn't the case. The door was left open on the way down, I'd been certain we left it that way. I noticed her face again, panic now laden in her expression.



“Don’t worry, if there’s a basement here then there must be some another door or something to get out. Wouldn’t it be illegal if they didn’t? It sounds like a fire hazard.” Trying to lighten the mood here was not working I judged, based on how Catherine didn’t laugh this time. She shifted her weight from one hip to another. To further remedy this, I offered her a smile. “It’s gonna be okay.”



Still, this didn’t change her expression, but she did reach out and take my hand. I took this for the small victory it was and started to lead her back downstairs. I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t nervous at this point, but for the sake of us both I tried to keep my composure as best I could. As we descended, I started to wonder what it even was that I was afraid of. It was just us down there- but the notebook had made it seem like someone had been here for a while. I began to wonder what became of them, and why no one had ever made it a point to mention it was even a part of this building’s history.



Now back at the crates, Catherine bent over and grabbed the small book from the floor, her other hand still in mine. “Maybe this guy talked about an exit other than the door?”



I shrugged and she took her hand back. As she was searching through the pages, I scanned the rest of the room. I don’t know what compelled me to do so, seeing as we had been there a few moments before, but I just had the feeling that I needed to. Something about the air had changed. It was stale and dried my throat with each breath. That’s when I noticed it. 



The door that had been shrouded in the almost dark, leftover glow of the lanterns to our left was open. Not all the way so we could see inside, but enough to notice that it was in a different position than before. Neither of us had gone over there before then, and there was no one else down there with us.



There isn’t anyone. I remember I had to tell myself. We would’ve seen or heard someone by now.



I took a step forward towards the door, instinctively. I needed; I wanted to know what was beyond it. I was thinking maybe there would be an exit or someone who could help us find it. Either way, it was now my job to investigate, for both of us. I took another step, fixated on the gap in the door and wall, staring into the dark. I couldn’t peel my eyes away, maybe in fear or maybe in awe, I couldn’t place the feelings at that point. I still have trouble placing them when I think about this moment, but I knew that something wanted me to see what was beyond the door.



“Adrian?”



Catherine’s voice took my attention back and I spun to see I had made it halfway across the basement from her. I only recall taking a few steps, but clearly, I’d gone much further.



“Sorry, the door is open,"" I explained ""and I came over to peek in.”



I could see her face change in the flickering of the lamps. She was confused, just as I found myself now, seeing her like this.

“The door looks closed to me.” She said, softly now.



I turned, and she was right. The door sat closed, an overbearing figure in the darkest corner of our cell. There was no gap; no change. The wonder that had come over me moments before passed, and I was finding it hard to explain, even to myself, what had compelled me to walk over.



I made my way back to her quickly. “I guess it was a trick of the light. I seriously thought it was open.”



Cathy let go of her breath, and I saw her shoulders drop. “Okay. You were just walking over there. It was starting to freak me out. I called out a few times but you just kept walking.”



“Yeah, sorry...” I rubbed the back of my neck, wondering if the door had been closed this entire time. Maybe the freaky stuff we’d been reading was starting to get to me. It was late, and I wanted out more than ever, but we still had to find a way.

“Find anything useful?”



Shaking her head, I felt her disappointment. “Nothing. Not even a small window or something. This guy just keeps going on about the test and weird dreams.”



“More about the thing he saw?”



“Almost nothing but that. Though, now I’ve made it to these pages where he refused to sleep.”



I nodded to her, and she read:



“I don’t know what day it is anymore. Nora, I’m sorry about my outburst. I thought I had been sleeping through the night but there is no night. There is no day. There are no days in here. I feel like I am losing my mind. 



Pills. The pills are making me sleep. I’m not taking them anymore. I can’t take them. They are bringing it in here. Every time I close my eyes I see it. Please, Nora I just want to come home. I am scared. No one has come for me. There’s no way out and the door is locked. I am stuck and the more I see it the more real it looks. It's with me now. Nora, I miss you. God I miss you.”



“This guy sounds like he’s going through something rough."" I stopped her from continuing. ""We don’t know why he was homeless before this. I don’t trust him. If he doesn’t mention a door or window, then I don’t think we’re gonna find anything useful. I guess we’re just gonna have to start looking through the rooms.”



I noticed that I was starting to feel hot. The lack of any useful information now fueled an anger I couldn’t shake. All fear deserted me, replaced with the need for freedom. Without another word, I made my way to the door ahead of us and threw it open.



“What are you doing?” I heard Cathy ask from behind me. I made my way inside. This room was about the same size as the one we’d been in with the lectern and weird symbols, but it was furnished. There was a bedroll on the floor in the back right corner. Wads of paper littered the floor, which I quickly imagined had been used for sanitation.



How could these people leave the place so disgusting? I thought. How is there no way out?



I was answered by the smell of piss.



I stormed out, not interested in questioning anything further without the promise of a way out. This time, I headed to the door in the dim corner, but as I put my hand on the handle, I felt a cold rush fall over me. All anger deserted me, and everything in me warned me to stop. The muscles in my hands tensed to firmly grasp the knob and turn, but I found I overexerted and gripped the handle so hard my knuckles were starting to become pale. My stomach churned. I gagged on my spit. I needed to leave that door alone. I couldn’t open it. I felt like if it opened in that moment I would disappear. Like I'd die. The sensation flowed over my person, and it became overwhelming. I was now under the impression that my death was imminent. Crumbling to the floor, I pulled my hands to my head. Tears threatened to fall from the corners of my eyes. I wanted out then more than ever, but still had no idea where to go. I'd run out of ideas.



“It’s going to be okay. We’ll just have to wait it out.” Catherine’s voice was a light in the dark. I looked up at her and opened my mouth to say something, but I couldn’t. I had no words. She got down next to me and threw her arms around my body in the most comforting hug of my life. The tears never fell, but I clung to Cathy as tight as I could.



“I’m sorry,” I sputtered, bringing her as close to me as I could manage “I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”



“It’s okay, I don’t blame you.”



There was silence then, the flickering light our only ambiance.



“What do we do?” She asked, her voice a whisper.



“I guess the only thing we can. We’re just gonna have to wait until someone opens the door.”



She pulled her head back and looked up at me. “You think so?”



“Probably. When does the next shift start?”



“1 or 1:30 I think.”



“That’s…” I tried to think but had no idea when we’d originally gotten down there. It felt like at least an hour, but with everything going on it wasn’t like I could tell at all. “a few hours from now- I think.”



“Maybe we could get some sleep?”



I scanned the room, eyes darting from the few objects to the doors around us. I did not like that idea. Something was wrong- I didn’t know how I knew, but I did. There was something wrong with the door I just couldn’t move past. Something was wrong with the entire basement.



Lost in my thoughts, I barely noticed Catherine’s hand on my cheek. “We’ll be okay.”



I don’t know how she'd done it then or how she does it now, but everything felt okay. It wasn’t her eyes; the way she was holding me then. Waves of relief thanks to her touch allowed me to relax, and I used the moment to pull her closer. It didn’t feel magical or special, however, I was comforted. 



After what felt like hours I pulled back. Cathy left her hand caressing my cheek, and I leaned into it, locking eyes with her.



We ultimately decided to sleep on the landing. Neither of us wanted to be in the open room much longer, and it'd be easier to hear someone or see shadows moving under the door if we did. There was nothing down there with us to worry about anyway. I told myself I was being paranoid; that I needed to stop trying to impress Catherine with my composure now that I’d lost it.

The gifts have to be relatively small and they have to travel well in a suitcase. The recipients are all male. $25-50 price range, roughly.

1jrrnml,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1jrrnml/large_containers_for_storing_desiccants/,Large containers for storing desiccants,"I have reusable silica gel desiccant containers that are a little over 5x5 inches (a little under 1 inch thick). I also have a lot of other variations on reusable silica gel. I am looking for 1 or more **reusable, resealable** containers for long-term (> 10 years) storage of these desiccants in a room that reaches 70% relative humidity on a regular basis. The container also has to be able to **withstand 300ºF** (for a margin of safety) so that I can put the desiccants into the container straight out of the oven after drying them out. Ideally I'd put some molecular sieve in the container to keep the silica gel dry, too.

I'm hoping you can refer me to glass or steel lab containers, preferably with a square or rectangular clamp-on lid, that fit the bill. References to other Reddits or other places to look are welcome. Unfortunately, this is a very hard thing to search for because anything like ""desiccant container"" or ""desiccant storage"" turns up solutions for holding desiccants in something to be used for drying out something else. 

Things I've considered and rejected: 

* **Mason Jars** used for canning: these are perfect for the small packets, but I cannot find one that will accommodate the big cans. The biggest mouth I've found is 4.3"". 
* **""Airtight"" or ""Waterproof"" Plastic Containers:** Correct me if I'm wrong, but my recollection is that these are not moisture proof, and past experience is that desiccants only last a few months in such containers.
* **Stainless Steel Coffee Bean Jars**: unfortunately, they all have ""CO2 valves"" that don't hold up well.
* **Mylar bags**: even though they have ziplock closures, they have to be heat sealed, so are not really reusable. 
* **Ammo Cans**: I haven't fully rejected this option, but the ammo cans I've used in the past didn't seal well and were expensive. Also kind of an odd size, hard to store. ",2,1743814849.0,chemistry,1,1.0,False

I’m moving to a new area that is pretty wide open for any creative food options. The restaurants seem mostly American food and no Mexican, Asian, Middle Eastern…not even a diner. Also it’s a college town. This would be my first cart/trailer/truck venture. 

I’d go for just doing coffee and try to make it a little different by serving a milder and stronger blend? Espresso if possible? 

I could do egg burritos, pastries  or Korean Street toast. It’s the food I like. 

I admit, I’m the annoying newbie. I had a very stressful job before I went back to school( life and death stressful) and I think part of me wants to do this as a way to see if I could still work with people but have things be lower stakes. My wife has a good job so I can experiment. I know it’s hard work.

I'm reaching out as I seem to have issues with foaming/steaming the milk with my Breville Bambino. I've had this machine for almost 6 months now and can never seem to get good milk texture, or a consistent shot for that matter. Some of the accessories I have is a standalone grinder by amzchef- It seems to do an decent job and can dial in a shot pretty nicely with it. I also use a wdt, a spring tamper, a funnel and paper screens. Some background: I am currently using the single hole steam wand that came with the machine and it just seems fail at incoroproating the microfoam despite how well the vortex is and how long it goes for. My brother in law has a bambino plus and i was able to manually steam milk beautifully with it multiple times as well along with get nice latte art even though i used a double wall filter with their machine. its the first attached photo in the white cup.

I even tried getting a 4 hole aftermarket tip to mimic the BBP, and although it helps(cetainly takes less time,) and seems to incorporate the microfoam better than the single hole tip, it still doesn't compare to the texture I acheive with the BBP.

It almost seems like the BBP has a stronger pump or warms the steam more or something? Even though I can't find any documentation online regarding those differences. I even tried calling breville but they said since i'm out of the 3 month return period; i'm basically SOL and the machine is ""behaving appropriately."" As far as the inconsistency in the shots go, i measure my beans to 18g, after being dialed in, and will get varying shots back to back.. it almost comes off as  inconsistent pressure.. i've descaled the machine a few times now. Removed and cleaned the shower screen, cleaned the tips. Drank way more coffee than probably healthy trying to perfect the art 😅 The second couple of photos in the green cup are with my breville bambino with the 4 hole tip. Any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance!

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. 

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. 

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop.

I’m not interested in ever being friends after this. I don’t deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"". AITA ?

15 yo, transgender male (pre transition), 1.68cm tall, 72.5kg eeight, smoking, I do not take any medicine, I‘ve been working out 2-3 times a week for about a month, I have a history of self-harm

Sometimes, right before I fall asleep I relax and stop breathing, I usually jump up from my bed to take a few deep breaths (I can‘t control jumping up, it just happens, it‘s probably from lack of oxygen), I‘m anxious of falling asleep because of this. This also happens more than once each night.

I have had poor sleep for years and I do have slight eyebags, I‘m tired all the time and coffee can barely fix it. My eyes feel like they can barely stay open and they burn.

As said, I feel tired all the time but no matter how tired I am I can‘t find myself falling asleep, last night it took me over an hour, I wasn‘t on my phone I was just laying in bed with chill music and my eyes closed, that either puts me to sleep in less than 5 minutes or over half an hour.

Right when I start falling asleep I start dreaming while I‘m conscious but I don‘t know about it. Last night I dreamed I was on a car ride at night and I heard the voices of my family. I also often hear my teachers or classmates voices in the stages where I’m starting to fall aslerp but most often they‘re not understandable. One time I was between dreaming and conscious I was dreaming I was in class and I actually did raise my hand in both reality and dream.

I often wake up feeling lightheaded, with a headache or/ and back pain. From around November-Janruary I couldnt properly get up from anywhere without starting to feel dizzy. I got dizzy from running, standing, looking up, laying on my back and getting up from any laying/sitting position. It‘s the same dizzyness I got from anaesthesia. I once fell and hit myself on my desk because of this. (I rarely feel THAT dizzy anymore)

Sometimes when I get up my eyes black out and I see dots, I need to sit back down so I don‘t fall. My legs sometimes feel heavy as well

Sometimes I can‘t stand any my whole body feels so heavy, legs feel like a ton, my feet hurt, my arms are hard to move and I feel tired and like I‘m about to collapse on the spot but I never do.

I feel anxious for no reason and my hearbeat goes up. Sometimes it feels like a rush through my body that I cannot describe, it makes me dizzy and it‘s hard to stand upright and my eyes probably dialate because I suddenly start seeing better. This used to happen a lot.

I can‘t concentrate at all, except if I‘m zoning out or doing something I truly enjoy. I sometimes zone out for no particular reason.

A lot of the time I have depressive thoughts for no apparent reason, my life is really joyful. these thoughts make me extremely anxious and reduce my sleep as well.

Sometimes my whole personality changes over the course of a few days, that includes music taste, gender idendity, sexuality, the way I talk, how I percieve other people and see the world and other opinions.

I have no (mental) illness diagnosed. I‘m soon going to therapy.

I have assumed sleep apnea and low iron before but some of the things I do hint for mental illness and neurodivergence, I‘m not sure if the things said on google are true.
