I'm a ( 27 f) moved back in with my parents a year ago. trust me I would love to have my own place as that would solve all my issues, but im paying off all my debt I ended up in from my previous relationship, im in school as well, while I work a full time job (45hrs+ a week) I'm putting most of my money to paying off my debt, I still have a car, insurance, phone bill and groceries so I can't afford my own place. 

obviously I no longer have any privacy or space anymore, and my main thing is I live in my parents place for free (I used to have to pay rent before I moved out at 20) so I know if give them any type of attitude they will bring up the fact I live there for free. i work alot, in online school, buy my own groceries clean up after myself and my cats, but  ive been struggling to get back on a routine for the last year, since moving back obviously I can't to the things I did living on my own, like cleaning when i want, having friends over and smoking cigarettes/weed, I can't even smoke in the backyard I have to leave the property, (which i do bc they dont smoke i get that)

 I work night shift (have been for the last 6 years) 
my parents are retired and are always home, I started sleeping with ear plugs so they don't usually wake me up, but it's the constantly coming into my room while I'm sleeping, waking me up to do chores/favors, always on me about my spending (I have to buy my own groceries but they always tell me I'm spending to much) always  having any conversation turn into a lecture bc they dont like or agree with anything i do, they tell me I don't spend enough time with them, i do try to but i am busy alot, and always always always going through my stuff,  thru my mail, they are very very opinionated so anytime I do anything there's always some comment, ex: they hate coffee so everytime I make coffee they come into the kitchen to tell me the smell is gross and I shouldn't be making coffee. I know this stuff is little and I've been ignoring it but goddamn I swear they've gotten worse since I moved out LOL 

 i have tried multiple times, in multiple ways to kindly say "" I just got done a 12hr work shift, I really don't want to sit in the living room with you and watch the news, or talk about how in debt I am, I just want to sit in my room in slience"" or ""im trying to work out and do my yoga so can you please not stand at the door way and stare at me"" im not a morning person so I usually dont even talk to them when i wake up, and ive also mentioned im not a morning person so just dont even acknowledge me, but its always ""oh someones being a brat today""

. i only see my boyfriend on weekends as he lives an hour away, and sleep overs are not allowed under their roof (or his parents place, theyre hella religious) so usually we just want to sit in my room and relax or go on a day trip but then its ""oh well we wanna get to know ur boyfriend so you need to sit in the living room with us, why are you avoiding us""  and every time i get told I'm being a brat and have a shit attitude, i make bad decisions, im stupid, idk what to even say to them at this point lol I barley even talk to them now adays bc I dont want the lecture and I don't have the energy to fight, it's hard bc they are nice ppl and I know they mean well but it's just getting so frustrating ",1,1745829169.0,entitledparents,0,1.0,False

Choose Zindagi Stevia – A Natural, Sugar-Free Alternative","https://preview.redd.it/27qab89s3jxe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90ba67677df135b19842b69d872a4adab82f13f8

Is your sweetener really vegan? Discover the truth behind plant-based sweeteners and why Zindagi Stevia is the best stevia sweetener for your cruelty-free lifestyle.

# Introduction: Sugar, Sweeteners, and Vegan Living

Veganism is not just about not eating meat and dairy—it’s a whole lifestyle choice. And here’s the thing: even sugar can be a sneaky non-vegan ingredient. Shocking, right?



Which is why it’s really critical for anyone leading a plant-based lifestyle to take a closer look at what is sweetening their food. Whether you’re having a cup of coffee, making some cookies, or adding a smoothie to your menu, the question is—is your sweetener vegan?

# Understanding Vegan Sweeteners

# What Makes a Sweetener Non-Vegan?

You would think that sweeteners would be vegan-friendly. But the truth is that some are processed using bone char (yes, animal bones), specifically some white sugars. Others can contain additives like gelatin or milk derivatives. That's why vegan sweeteners need to be selected with care.

# Common Ingredients to Watch Out For

Look out for hidden animal-based additives such as:

* Bone char (used in sugar refining)
* Gelatin
* Shellac (from bugs)
* Honey or dairy-derived flavors

# Is Stevia Vegan? Let’s Break It Down

Stevia is a naturally occurring sweet plant in South America. The leaves are very sweet—200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar! The active component, which is steviol glycoside, gives stevia its sweetness boost.

# Does Stevia Fit a Plant-Based Lifestyle?

Yes—stevia is a plant, and most stevia products are vegan. But here's the catch: it depends on processing. There are some companies that use animal-based agents when refining, and that makes the final product non-vegan. So, selecting the stevia brand that says it is vegan-free is the best choice in the market.

# Processing Matters: The Key to Identifying Vegan-Friendly Stevia

When choosing stevia, look for:

* Labels that say “vegan certified”
* Brands that are transparent about their production process
* Natural, minimal processing techniques

# Zindagi Stevia – The Game Changer?

Zindagi Stevia is a[ **natural, zero-calorie**](https://zindagistevia.com/products/?v=f9f0a42f293e),[ **vegan sweetener** made from high-quality stevia](https://zindagistevia.com/products/?v=f9f0a42f293e) leaves. It is designed specifically for health-conscious individuals and plant-based eaters.

# Why It Stands Out as the Best Stevia Sweetener

Here’s what makes Zindagi a star:

https://preview.redd.it/685vvtu38jxe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=959cee6e439f4a55a0876fcf0696f38cc234ce3c

* **100% plant-based**
* **No artificial additives**
* **No sugar alcohols**
* **Free from chemicals and allergens**
* **Vegan and cruelty-free certified**

# Is Zindagi Stevia Safe for Vegans? Absolutely!

Zindagi checks all the vegan-friendly boxes. It’s one of the few stevia brands that is transparent about its clean, plant-based formulation, making it the best stevia brand for vegans.

# Comparing Vegan vs Non-Vegan Sweeteners

# Common Non-Vegan Sweeteners: What to Avoid

Some sweeteners to avoid if you’re vegan:

* White sugar (refined with bone char to decolorize and get the crystal white color)
* Some brands of brown sugar
* Honey (animal-derived)
* Aspartame (contains phenylalanine)

# Cruelty-Free Sweeteners: The Better Option

Go for sweeteners that are:

* Labeled “vegan”
* Plant-derived (like stevia, coconut sugar, agave, and maple syrup)
* Processed without animal products

# The Benefits of Plant-Based Sweeteners Like Zindagi

Zindagi offers all the sweetness without the baggage. You get:

* Zero calories
* No blood sugar spikes
* No animal cruelty
* A completely natural sweet taste

# How to Find a Vegan Sugar Substitute

* Clear company transparency

# Certifications That Matter

* Vegan written on the label.

# 

Zero Glycemic Impact

Stevia does not increase blood glucose levels and is therefore perfect for diabetics and anyone monitoring their sugar consumption. This is a big plus for individuals with metabolic disorders who need to keep their lifestyle vegan and low in sugar.



No Calories, All Flavor

While honey and syrups still contribute calories, stevia is actually zero-calorie. Zindagi Stevia, in this case, is perfect for calorie-watchful consumers and fitness-oriented vegans.



Gut-Friendly Sweetening

Unlike artificial sweeteners that may cause bloating or digestive discomfort, stevia is gentler on the gut. Zindagi’s formulation avoids sugar alcohols like xylitol, which often upset sensitive stomachs.



# Eco-Friendly and Ethical: Stevia’s Sustainability Bonus

Zindagi Stevia isn’t just better for your body—it’s better for the planet too.

**1. Less Water, Less Waste**

Stevia takes much less land and water than cane sugar, making it possible to practice sustainable agriculture. And that makes it not only vegan but also sustainable.

**2. Low Carbon Footprint**

Since Zindagi employs a clean, light processing process, the carbon impact of manufacturing is much lower compared to conventional sugar or artificial sweeteners.

**3. Fair and Transparent Sourcing**

Zindagi collaborates with morally upright farmers and maintains a cruelty-free supply chain. That's a double advantage for those who lead a vegan and socially conscious lifestyle.

# How Stevia Stacks Up Against Other Vegan Sweeteners

https://preview.redd.it/zo6gjfc9cjxe1.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaa042e0c93ae6e23bc3857ee28f610bb19b9065

# A Word on Artificial Sweeteners: Why Natural is Better

While many sugar substitutes are marketed as “diet-friendly,” not all of them are safe or ethical for vegan use.

# Artificial Doesn’t Mean Healthy

Ingredients such as saccharin and aspartame might be zero-calorie, but have side effects along the way. Chronic usage of artificial sweeteners has been linked to:

* Headaches
* Imbalance in hormones
* Stomach discomfort
* Potential neurological issues

# Natural Always Wins

Zindagi Stevia, on the other hand, as [a natural plant-based sweetener](https://zindagistevia.com/products/natural-sweetners/?v=f9f0a42f293e), bypasses all that trouble. It provides real sweetness minus the suspicious science.

Regardless of whether you're a newcomer to the world of vegan or a dedicated plant-based fanatic, Zindagi Stevia gives you a safe, healthy, and moral alternative to sweeten your foods and drinks.

Hi everyone! I just wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone. I've been dealing with what I thought was classic LPR for over a year now, and the main symptom that ruined my confidence was a weak, hoarse voice. I couldn’t project, couldn’t enunciate properly, and it made social interaction painful. I islolated myself and avoided socializing because of how painful and unclear my voice was.

My main symptoms were:

* **Extremely hoarse voice**, often completely unusable
* **Thick mucus** and constant throat clearing
* **Esophageal pounding** after fatty/spicy/acidic meals

Over the course of a year, I went through basically every possible mechanism and treatment I could find. Pepsin deactivation, throat coating and protection, acid reduction, LES healing, protective layer on stomach acid (alginate), gastric emptying, intolerances/allergies, etc. I've learned a lot, and thought I should share my journey and compile a comprehensive list of all the tips and tricks I've found. Here's what I tried, what worked, what didn’t, and what I’m still doing today:

# ✅ What Worked (Still Doing)

# PPI (Esomeprazole 20mg each night)

* **Impact:** Mild to High
* **Notes:** It didn’t completely fix my problems, but completely removed the ""pounding"" in my esophagus after meals. Still taking it.

# Alkaline Water (pH 8.5)

* **Impact:** Medium
* **Notes:** Helps deactivate pepsin. Especially useful in the morning and after meals. Still drinking it.

# Telfast (OTC 120mg x2 daily)

* **Impact:** High
* **Notes:** This was the *breakthrough* for me. Turns out I have a histamine intolerance or sensitivity, and Telfast (fexofenadine) is a non-sedating H1 blocker. It drastically reduced mucus, throat clearing, and gave me my voice back. Previously used mirtazapine as well with similar results.

# DGL, Slippery Elm, Marshmallow Root, Throat Coat Tea

* **Impact:** Medium
* **Notes:** I use these before meals to coat my throat. They’re soothing, especially if I’ve had a rough day. Still using them (bought large tubs), but undecided long-term.

# Digestive Enzymes

* **Impact:** Medium to High
* **Notes:** Helped with bloating and digestion, especially since PPIs can reduce stomach acid needed for proper digestion. Highly recommend if tolerated. Not yet tried serrapaptase, but will when it arrives. Supposedly good for mucus and bacterial biofilms and reduces phlehm buildup.

# NAC (1g morning + night)

* **Impact:** Medium
* **Notes:** Helps thin mucus and break down bacterial biofilms. Take with food — it’s acidic and can worsen symptoms if taken on an empty stomach.

# Melatonin (5mg), Calcium Bitrate, Zinc-L-carnosine

* **Impact:** Low
* **Notes:** Theoretically help with healing the LES and stomach lining. No obvious improvement, but still taking just in case.

# BPC-157 (250mcg x2 daily subQ), RLT (20 mins daily)

* **Impact:** Unknown
* **Notes:** Just started these. Hoping for long-term healing effects.

# ❌ What Didn’t Work (For Me)

# Alkaline Diet (pH 6+)

* **Impact:** Low
* **Notes:** After a full month, I noticed no difference. Still sticking to it mostly for safety, but not convinced.

# Fasting / Small Meals / Meal Timing

* **Impact:** Low
* **Notes:** Didn’t notice much change. I now eat small meals every 4 hours more out of habit than anything. Fasting is not recommended for LPR!

# Alginate Supplement

* **Impact:** Medium
* **Notes:** Effect similar to alkaline water. Makes a protective layer on top of stomach acid to prevent the acid from reaching your throat. I believe it was only effective because of the included antacids. Many sufferers find this extremely useful. Currently not using.

# Artichoke Extract, Bitters, Ginger, Post-Meal Walking

* **Impact:** Low
* **Notes:** Supposed to improve gastric emptying. No impact for me. Ginger actually made symptoms worse. Currently not using.

# OTC Antacids

* **Impact:** Medium
* **Notes:** Similar to alkaline water. Acutely improves some symptoms. I use alkaline water instead.

# 🚫 What I Didn’t Try

# D-Limonene

* Sold out everywhere I checked. Many report it helps reduce reflux and improves gastric emptying. Might try in future.

# Baclofen

* Prescription GABA-B agonist. Has been shown to decrease reflux events and increase lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Higher risk, should only be used as a last resort in my opinion.

# Vagus Nerve Stimulation

* Has been shown to improve symptoms of GERD by tightening the LES and improving stomach motility (less buildup). Might try a tVNS-device in the future.

# Elevated Bed

* Number one tip for people suffering from reflux. Elevating the head while sleeping reduces symptoms a lot. Will try soon.

# 💡 Tips + Final Thoughts

* Get a comprehensive allergy/intolerance test — I suspect histamine is a bigger issue than most people think, but other issues like gluten and dairy can also be a trigger. Do an elimination diet. I can recommend ""The Acid Watcher Diet"".
* We all have different triggers, what works for me might not work for you!
* Use a pH meter to test your food and drinks. Anything below pH 5 can reactivate pepsin.
* Don’t take NAC on an empty stomach — it’s acidic.
* Limit the use of stimulants (that includes coffee, unfortunately).
* Try combining Telfast + soothing agents + good hydration + light meals and see what happens after a few days.

I know what it feels like to lose your voice, *especially when nobody takes it seriously*. It wrecks your confidence. This post is for anyone who's tried everything and still feels stuck.

You might just be missing the histamine piece of the puzzle like I was.

Feel free to ask anything below, I’ll try to help however I can. Good luck to anyone still searching for answers!

You're rushing around, trying to look presentable, and somehow expected to fuel your body properly? Yeah, right! But here's the thing: skipping breakfast is basically setting yourself up for a day of hangry disasters.

Ever wondered why nutritionists won't shut up about protein at breakfast? It's because it actually works! A high-protein morning meal keeps you full longer, helps maintain muscle, and gives you steady energy instead of that sad sugar crash waiting to happen.

I've been on a mission to find breakfast options that pack a protein punch without breaking the calorie bank. Trust me, after years of sad, soggy cereal, these recipes have been total game-changers for my mornings.

# 1. Greek Yogurt Power Bowls (285 calories)

Who doesn't love a breakfast that's basically customizable art? Greek yogurt bowls are my go-to when I need something quick that still feels fancy.

Start with 1 cup plain Greek yogurt (24g protein), add 1/4 cup fresh berries, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 tablespoon chopped nuts. The combination of creamy yogurt with the crunch of nuts is *chef's kiss*.

What makes this so awesome is the versatility—swap fruits based on what's in season, change up your nuts, or add a sprinkle of cinnamon when you're feeling fancy.

# 2. Savory Egg Muffins (190 calories)

These portable protein bombs have literally saved my mornings more times than I can count. Make a batch on Sunday, and you've got breakfast sorted for days!

Mix 8 eggs with chopped spinach, bell peppers, and a sprinkle of low-fat cheese. Pour into a muffin tin and bake at 350°F for about 20 minutes. Each muffin packs about 12g of protein with minimal prep work.

The best part? They taste great cold or heated up. I've eaten these while literally running out the door and they hold up amazingly well.

# 3. Protein-Packed Overnight Oats (280 calories)

Okay, let me convert you to the overnight oats cult if you're not already a member. They're a busy person's dream breakfast!

Combine 1/2 cup rolled oats, 3/4 cup milk (regular or plant-based), 1 scoop protein powder (about 20g protein), 1 teaspoon chia seeds, and a dash of vanilla extract. Let it chill in the fridge overnight, and boom—breakfast is ready when you are.

I personally like adding a tablespoon of peanut butter and sliced banana in the morning for extra flavor. The texture is amazingly creamy, and it keeps me full until lunch.

# 4. Smoked Salmon Breakfast Toast (295 calories)

When I'm feeling fancy but still need to keep it under 300 calories, this is my go-to. It's like brunch-level delicious without the brunch-level calories.

Toast 1 slice of whole grain bread, spread with 1 tablespoon light cream cheese, top with 2 ounces smoked salmon, a few capers, and some thinly sliced red onion. The protein content? A solid 20g that'll keep hunger at bay for hours.

The salty-creamy combination is honestly better than any bagel shop creation I've had. Plus, it takes like 3 minutes to throw together.

# 5. Protein Smoothie Bowl (275 calories)

For those ""I can't even deal with chewing yet"" mornings, smoothie bowls are the answer. And they're WAY more satisfying than drinking your breakfast.

Blend 1 scoop protein powder (20g protein), 1/2 frozen banana, 1/2 cup frozen berries, 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk, and a handful of spinach (you won't taste it, I promise!). Pour into a bowl and top with 1 tablespoon granola and a few sliced almonds.

The thick, spoonable texture makes it feel like you're having ice cream for breakfast. Who's going to complain about that? :/

# 6. Turkey and Veggie Breakfast Wrap (290 calories)

Not all breakfast has to fit the ""breakfast food"" mold. Sometimes lunch for breakfast is the move, especially for savory food lovers.

Warm a small whole wheat tortilla, add 3 ounces lean turkey breast, a handful of baby spinach, 2 tablespoons salsa, and 1 tablespoon low-fat Greek yogurt (instead of sour cream). Roll it up and you've got 25g of protein in a portable package.

I've prepped these the night before and eaten them cold, and they're still delicious. The yogurt swap for sour cream adds even more protein without sacrificing creaminess.

# 7. Cottage Cheese and Fruit Plate (260 calories)

Hear me out—cottage cheese deserves a comeback. It's packed with protein and way more versatile than people give it credit for.

Serve 1 cup cottage cheese (28g protein!) with 1/2 cup sliced fresh peaches or berries and a sprinkle of cinnamon. The sweet-savory combination is surprisingly addictive.

IMO, the texture is what throws people off, but mixing it with fruit changes the whole experience. Give it a chance!

# 8. Mini Protein Pancakes (295 calories)

Weekend vibes without the weekend calorie count? Yes, please! These little pancakes feel indulgent but won't derail your day.

Mix 1/4 cup rolled oats (ground in blender), 1 scoop protein powder, 1 egg, 1/4 cup egg whites, 1/2 banana, and a dash of cinnamon. Cook small pancakes in a non-stick pan with minimal cooking spray.

Top with a tablespoon of pure maple syrup or fresh berries. Each serving (about 4 mini pancakes) delivers approximately 22g of protein and serious satisfaction.

# 9. Spinach and Feta Egg White Scramble (240 calories)

When I need something hot and satisfying in minutes, this scramble is my go-to. It feels like diner food but without the grease guilt.

Scramble 1 cup egg whites with 1 cup fresh spinach, 2 tablespoons crumbled feta, and a dash of dried oregano. Serve with a slice of tomato on the side for freshness.

The feta adds so much flavor that you won't miss the egg yolks, and you're looking at about 25g of pure protein. Not bad for something that takes 5 minutes to make!

# 10. Chocolate Protein Chia Pudding (285 calories)

For all my dessert-for-breakfast people: this one's for you. It tastes indulgent but is actually packed with nutrition.

Mix 3 tablespoons chia seeds with 1 cup unsweetened almond milk, 1 scoop chocolate protein powder, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. Let it sit in the fridge overnight, and in the morning, you'll have a pudding-like treat with about 20g of protein.

I like topping mine with a few raspberries and a square of dark chocolate when I'm feeling extra. It's like having chocolate pudding for breakfast, but it's actually good for you!

# 11. Ham and Veggie Breakfast Cups (230 calories)

These little cups are like personal mini quiches without the heavy crust. They're perfect for meal prep!

Line a muffin tin with thin slices of ham to create cups. Fill with a mixture of beaten eggs, diced bell peppers, spinach, and a sprinkle of low-fat cheese. Bake at 375°F for about 15-18 minutes.

Each cup provides around 15g of protein, and having two still keeps you under the 300-calorie mark. They reheat beautifully for busy mornings.

# 12. High-Protein Avocado Toast (290 calories)

Avocado toast gets a protein upgrade! This isn't your basic brunch item—it's a power breakfast.

Toast 1 slice of high-protein bread (like Dave's Killer Bread), top with 1/4 mashed avocado, 2 sliced hard-boiled eggs, a squeeze of lemon, and red pepper flakes. This combo delivers about 19g of protein.

The creamy avocado with the eggs is basically breakfast perfection. I've had this three times in one week before and didn't get tired of it.

# 13. Berry Protein Breakfast Parfait (275 calories)

Layered parfaits feel fancy but are actually super simple to put together. Plus, they're perfect for prepping ahead.

Layer 3/4 cup Greek yogurt with 1/2 cup mixed berries and 2 tablespoons low-sugar granola. Add a drizzle of honey if needed. This pretty breakfast packs about 22g of protein.

I like making these in clear containers for grab-and-go breakfasts that still look Instagram-worthy. :)

# 14. Tofu Breakfast Scramble (260 calories)

Plant-based friends, this one's for you! Tofu scrambles are seriously underrated protein powerhouses.

Crumble 6 ounces of firm tofu and sauté with 1/4 cup each diced bell peppers and onions, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, and your favorite spices. The turmeric gives it that eggy yellow color, and the texture is surprisingly similar to scrambled eggs.

With about 20g of plant protein, it's a great way to start the day without animal products. Even as a non-vegan, I enjoy this at least once a week!

# 15. Protein-Boosted Breakfast Quesadilla (295 calories)

Quesadillas aren't just for lunch or dinner! This breakfast version is a game-changer for savory breakfast lovers.

Fill a small whole wheat tortilla with 1/4 cup egg whites, 2 tablespoons black beans, 2 tablespoons low-fat cheese, and pico de gallo. Cook in a non-stick pan until crispy and melty.

This combination delivers about 22g of protein with the bonus of fiber from the beans. The crispy exterior with the melty filling is breakfast heaven.

# 16. Protein-Packed Apple ""Cookies"" (270 calories)

These aren't really cookies, but they're shaped like them and taste way better than most protein breakfasts!

Slice an apple into rounds, spread each with 1 tablespoon almond butter, and top with a sprinkle of granola, chia seeds, and a few dark chocolate chips. Three ""cookies"" come in at about 16g of protein.

They're crunchy, creamy, sweet, and satisfying—hitting all the texture points you want in a breakfast. Plus, they're fun to make and eat!

# 17. Smoked Tuna Breakfast Patties (255 calories)

Fish for breakfast might sound weird to some, but it's actually common in many cultures—and for good reason!

Mix 3 ounces canned tuna with 1 egg white, 1 tablespoon diced onion, 1 tablespoon diced bell pepper, and a pinch of smoked paprika. Form into patties and cook in a non-stick pan until golden.

These patties pack a whopping 28g of protein and the smoky flavor is surprisingly delicious in the morning. Serve with a slice of tomato or a handful of greens.

# 18. Savory Cottage Cheese Bowl (285 calories)

Taking cottage cheese in a savory direction completely transforms it. Trust me on this one!

Top 1 cup cottage cheese with 1/4 avocado (diced), cherry tomatoes, cucumber, a sprinkle of everything bagel seasoning, and fresh herbs. This savory bowl provides about 30g of protein.

It's fresh, creamy, and so satisfying—like a deconstructed salad that's perfect for breakfast. The everything bagel seasoning is the secret weapon here.

# 19. Protein Coffee Smoothie (265 calories)

For the ""don't talk to me until I've had my coffee"" crowd, this combines your caffeine fix with breakfast!

Blend 1 cup cold coffee with 1 scoop vanilla protein powder, 1/2 frozen banana, 1 tablespoon almond butter, and a handful of ice. You'll get about 20g of protein along with your caffeine kick.

I discovered this combo when running late one morning and needed both coffee and breakfast simultaneously. It's now a regular in my rotation.

# 20. Sweet Potato Protein Toast (290 calories)

Forget regular toast—sweet potato ""toast"" is the perfect vehicle for protein-packed toppings!

Slice sweet potato lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices and toast them twice on high (or bake ahead of time). Top two slices with 2 tablespoons almond butter, 1/2 sliced banana, and a sprinkle of cinnamon. This delivers about 15g of protein.

The sweet potato base adds nutrients regular toast can't match, and the natural sweetness pairs perfectly with nut butter. It's worth the extra few minutes of prep time, I promise!

# Time-Saving Tips for High-Protein Breakfasts

Let's be honest—mornings are chaotic. Here are some ways I've found to make these high-protein breakfasts actually happen:

* **Batch prep components**: Hard-boil a dozen eggs, make a big batch of overnight oats, or pre-cook sweet potato slices.
* **Portion ingredients ahead**: Measure protein powder into baggies, portion nuts into containers, or freeze smoothie ingredients together.
* **Embrace make-ahead recipes**: Many of these (like egg muffins, overnight oats, and chia pudding) can be fully prepared days in advance.

The key is finding what works for your schedule—for me, spending 30 minutes on Sunday saves at least an hour of stress during weekday mornings.

# Why These Recipes Actually Work

After trying countless ""healthy"" breakfast recipes that left me hungry by 10 AM, these options stand out because they:

* **Combine protein with fiber**: This duo keeps you full longer than either nutrient alone.
* **Include healthy fats**: A little fat goes a long way for satisfaction and flavor.
* **Offer variety**: With options across sweet, savory, hot, cold, and different cultural influences, breakfast boredom is impossible.

I've personally tested each of these in real-life scenarios—rushing mornings, work-from-home days, and weekend brunches. They hold up in taste, convenience, and staying power.

High-protein breakfasts have seriously changed my morning energy levels and even helped with controlling my appetite throughout the day. No more mid-morning vending machine emergencies!

Give these recipes a shot, mix and match components based on what you have on hand, and find your own favorites. Your mornings (and your hunger levels) will thank you!",1,1745828707.0,Fitnessplates,0,1.0,False

1k9qgo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1k9qgo9/friend_who_doesnt_prioritize_me_and_stays_friends/,Friend who doesn't prioritize me and stays friends with someone who hurt me,"I would appreciate some advice.

I (30F) have a friend (31F) since many years back. I consider her one of my closest friends and she says the same about me.

She has a girlfriend since a few years back, who is very demanding of her time, and has also emotionally abused her in the past. I have supported her a lot through this and my friend considered leaving but didn’t. My friend claims it’s all fine now. Her partner sometimes works in another city, but they live very close to each other.

For the last years, I feel like my friend never prioritizes seeing me, even as I’ve recently told her that lately I’ve been struggling with some worsening health issues and feeling lonely and could really use a quick meetup. I’m in a long-distance relationship and I work from home. I never call her or text her for support when I’m struggling, and I talk to other people instead or deal with it myself, as I do not want to burden her.

All I’ve been asking is for us to meet up for a coffee sometimes (a few times a month at most), or that she could spend half a day with me at least every once in a while, not only after work. The weekends are always reserved for her girlfriend/family.

She says she wants to see me, but we often need to book a “slot” many weeks in advance, but only see each other for a few hours after her work whenever it suits her. When we hang out, usually her girlfriend calls her or texts her and she always chooses to reply immediately. Rescheduling if something unexpected comes up is very difficult as she's decided to spend the following 2 weeks only with her gf.

She also stayed friends with a mutual friend of ours, whom I chose to cut out of my life since he was often picking on me, humiliating me or threatening to beat me up when he got angry, even if he later sometimes apologized. He never treated her that way but she was always present and she was there during our last conversation and when i ended it with him. She validated my feelings but never took a stand against him. She and I were very close at this point. I didn’t want to force her to choose between us so I let it go.

When i recently told a mutual friend who used to know him, about the situation in my friend’s presence, she got defensive and said I was talking shit about him. It hurts me that she defends a person who treated me so badly, often with her as a witness. It has been a couple of years. We reconciled and I told her that my feelings are valid to which she agreed, but, in the end, I had to apologize for talking about him “in the open” with our mutual friend, who also saw a lot of his behaviour and agrees with me.

I kindly told her several times over the years about how I did not feel prioritized by her, but nothing changed, even though she took it well.

At the same time, when we actually do see each other, we usually have fun and she supports me. But it’s getting harder and I feel resentment now. I know she has her own mental health struggles, but she always seem to have time and energy for everyone else and other activities.

I don’t know if I should distance myself, lower my expectations or what to do. I have started to doubt my own feelings.

**TLDR:** My friend never seems to prioritize me, even when I told her I would really need some company. She also stays close friends with someone who hurt me and defends him in front of me. What to do?",1,1745828361.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1k9qgl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mirtazapine_Remeron/comments/1k9qgl5/strange_reaction_to_mirtazapine_after_3_days_high/,Strange reaction to mirtazapine after 3 days! High blood pressure.,"Basically just to clarify I have pots. No ordinary post. At rest my BP is normal but changing body position raises it for a bit until I adjust after a min or so. Also affects heart rate but I'm cleared by cardiologist. 

Now the experience. 

I started taking mirtazapine 6 days ago. First day it just knocked me out after about an hour(took it at 8 pm) . That night I slept very long. Woke up at noon the next day. Was feeling very refreshed. However throughout the day I feel very zombie and spaces like I'm in a dream. I had lack of emotions but also reduced anxiety that I only took my pregabalin onece whilst I'm supposed to take it three times per day. I took my second dose at 8 pm and falling asleep this time was a bit more difficult. I was sedated and drowsy but wasn't falling asleep for a few hours however one I slept by midnight I was sleeping good and slept 12 hours.

Day 2

I was refreshed again that day and throughout the day I noticed the emotional blunting was much better and mood was quite stable without anxiety. I was checking my blood pressure regularly and it was always normal. I took my dose at 8 and fell asleep at by 11 pm. 

Day 3. I was feeling good however these 3 days I was almost in bed most of the time. I was eating and drinking coffee but I was forgetting to drink water at all so I only had coffee these days with a little sip of water here and there to drink my meds.  I took my dose as usual and fell asleep and had best sleep ever. 

Day 4 my mood was good but I had a feeling of anxiety by the evening and felt like my heart beating strangely. I went out to get a coffee and checked my blood pressure on the way. First time it showed me 140/110. Second time 150/100. Third time it was 130/70. I took the coffee and went home. I checked it again at home and same thing . Bpbwas high first 2 times and the third was normal . I was mostly worried about diastolic BP because my diastolic is usually 50-60. High diastolic means constricted blood vessels. That day I didn't take my dose because of anxiety about blood pressure. 

Day 5-6 I decided to stop the meds. BP was still showing high at times. Day 5 I felt very euphoric for some reason. Felt like my old self. 

I really wanted this medication to work as I don't do well with SSRIs and I'm a bit disappointed. I don't mind that I was dumb on it and less mentally sharp than usual. But if it will be messing with my blood pressure it won't be worth taking it. I developed quite bad headache on day 6 and that felt like migraine. I then realised that because I wasn't drinking much water all these days that could have spiked my blood pressure as the first 3 days the blood pressure was fine.  

Do you guys think I should give it another chance ? 

Does this cause blood pressure issues for anyone else? Dose was 15 mg. I'm also taking pregabalin 75 mg X3 but these days I was barely taking it at all.",2,1745828349.0,Mirtazapine_Remeron,0,1.0,False

I’m mildly hypomanic right now, and feel like I only “need” 5-6hrs of sleep a night instead of my regular 8-9. After about six hours I wake up feeling rested and wired like I’ve already had multiple cups of coffee. 

However, my brain still needs its 8hrs a night of sleep, and if I let myself get out of bed after the six hours multiple days in a row I’m guaranteed to get a migraine. I have to force myself to keep trying to sleep, and only manage very light sleep (dreaming, but aware that I’m asleep and what position I’m in on my bed etc) for those last two hours, and it feels like such a waste of time.

This morning I woke up in a man's bed for the first time. He had an open window and only two pillows. It strikes me now how similar it was to your bed. 

You'd come up a few times that past day. He'd asked about my experience, and I'd shared. I can talk about you openly now, it unnerves me sometimes. 

He made me breakfast and only had instant coffee. I said it was fine, and asked for it black. I took a sip and was already tearing up from the smell alone. 

I can't separate it from you. I still can't. I was grateful he wasn't there to see me cry over a warm drink and a plate of toast. 

I hadn't realised until then how it still lived within me. How this part of you still latched on. I drank it down and was left coughing. 

I ate our sins for breakfast and I thanked you. He was in another room when I whispered your name and said goodbye. I'd drink you all again if I could.

And still, he smelt my shirt as we finally arose from bed. He thought it was his in the dark and seemed happy that it smelt like me. I understood the feeling.

I'm not expecting my book to be an instant hit. I'm just happy that I finally finished *A* book. That's all. Any profits that come out of this will be a bonus.

It's not an epic novel. Just a measly 20k word satire on the current trade war. Boy, did I had a lot of fun writing it. 

I've been procrastinating writing for so long. I love writing but a book is so daunting. Completing this first one is such a milestone for me and it has given me so many insights into what it takes to be a writer. It does take time, brain power, sleepless nights and lots of coffee!

My only advice to those still struggling, don't give up. Just keep going and finish it. Don't be a perfectionist. It's week never be perfect. I'm expecting a lot of negative reviews for mine. But it's finished and i did my best.

1k9qadr,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesBookClub/comments/1k9qadr/rock_n_roll_billboards_of_the_sunset_strip/,Rock 'n' Roll Billboards of the Sunset Strip,"[Rock 'n' Roll Billboards of the Sunset Strip  by Robert Landau](https://amzn.to/4iC0jwi)

The Sunset Strip, circa 1967. Buffalo Springfield called it right: “There’s something happening here…what it is ain’t exactly clear.” What was happening then is now absolutely clear. Rock ’n’ roll and the kids who lived it were coming of age―right there on The Strip. And, as if to define the era, a few independent minds in the music industry posted giant, temporary monuments that said it all. Billboards. Bigger than life. Hand-painted homages to rock. The Doors led the way. It seemed that billboards would chronicle rock forever.

In Rock ’n’ Roll Billboards of the Sunset Strip, author/photographer Robert Landau showcases these signs of the time, a time when rock was the most important music ever recorded, when youth, politics, and art merged to turn counterculture into mainstream culture.

Landau was right there, a kid destined to be a professional photographer, shooting his first pictures. Decades later, he rediscovered his Kodachromes, the only extensive collection of photographs that document those iconic billboards. Impassioned, he interviewed the artists, record producers, and designers who shaped those placards, bringing fresh insight to the culture of the day and its lasting impact on the world. He tells it like it was, through the people who lived the music, the time, the energy…and the billboards.

A must for every rock lover, pop-art aficionado, and socio-culture freak, Rock ’n’ Roll Billboards of the Sunset Strip is a coffee-table book to read and reread, view and review, a book with a beginning and, perhaps tragically, an end. Yes, the true rock ’n’ roll billboard era ended, but Robert Landau has created a bound museum of its best artwork, a gallery that shows what was happening there. On the Sunset Strip.

It’s quite short but I enjoyed a lot of things about LU. The food, coffee shops, people, and the location itself. In the morning, it was like a quiet place wherein normal travelers simply pass by. But as the sun sets, the real life starts to become uncontrollable. I’d love to see those people enjoying their lives for once. I don’t know their stories but I’m happy for them talking random people and hanging out with them. 

And so, here’s a short story of mine. I (29M) went to Tavern for a quick drink while listening to the music. There was this girl that I was staring at and she’s into me, I guess. She stares at me like a fire and I felt like melting. I was about to talk her but I’m with the guys to accompany with. But, if I have a chance again to meet her, I won’t miss the opportunity. In fact, I’ll go visit LU again by next month alone. I hope she’s there. Just to describe her a little, she’s skinny, has lovely cheek bone and quite petite. I hope to see her again soon.

A few years back we were housemates and were in the same major at university. We have stayed in constant contact even if there were pauses of a few months here and there. We have long conversations about almost everything and she is someone I completely trust. She actually got engaged last fall and I could not be more happy her. Her fiancé is an absolute joy and I wish them all the happiness in the world. 

But basically I was really happy to get an invite to their engagement party and offered to help in any way. This led to me being in the kitchen and serving all the other guests for the entire day(I knew they would be underprepared when it comes to hosting). I was happy to help out and be there for her whole entire family because I know the tough time they have been going through. I was so grateful that I was able to get accommodation for helping out since I had traveled three hours to their city. Due to an emergency plans changed and I ended up being there the whole of the next day. I made coffee, cleaned, cooked and even cut my friends mothers hair while being there for her as emotional support. I was more than happy to. I had no work that day and I felt I needed to be there to take care of things. 

Fast forward a few months, I was asked to go wedding dress shopping. Ofcourse I said yes🤩. When I arrived it was just her, her mom and I. We had a lovely time and actually found a great dress that fit perfectly. It felt really special to be there for her. I knew I was not going to be a bridesmaid and that was perfectly fine. I had no need to be one. I git talking with the mom and said I could do her hair for the wedding if she wanted (I have done another friends moms, and the grooms moms hair for another wedding last year which was a load of fun). 

But anyways today I was messaging this friend of mine and got talking about accommodation and flights with her wedding being held in the country they are moving to. She gies to say well since I have five bridesmaids and cant have more, I guess you could be an unofficial one. I could accommodate you with everyone and well you would be invited to the bachelorette anyways. 

Am I an idiot for being a bit upset for being asked to be an unofficial bridesmaid? I understand not being able to have a ton of them with weddings being so expensive. And I am perfectly fine nit being one of her closest friends. But honestly it does make me feel like a second rate friend that she feels she needs to include out of guilt or pity. I’ve just been happy to be there for her and her family in this time of happiness but also turmoil and it would be easier to not be included at all than be an unofficial bridesmaid. So should I turn her down on the offer of accommodation even though it would help with doing her mom’s hair and possibly helping in any other way? I just don’t want to reply in a flurry of emotion and say something that could hurt anyone but I would much rather her not think of me at all then include me out of guilt or some false responsibility.",1,1745827286.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Heya!
I'm from 🇮🇹 and in 3 months I'm going to move to the States (NY)!

I have lupus and fibromyalgia; I also have anxiety due to bad previous relationships that ended up with me being cheated and too many empty promises. I can be very chatty and like to share moments of my life: videos, photos, voice messages. I am also going to therapy for my anxiety-

I love cooking (🤌🏻 ) , listening to rock/metal and pop while running or while doing silly things with my friends. I am too much into dark and fantasy themes. I also have a tendency to give names to the items that I care too much for (my bike, my gaming PC, etc).

I'm a huge bike fan (I am going to get a KTM 990duke), I am sporty: I do enduro, jog, work out a bit. My obsessions are vroom vrooms over all 🤣 and books (with a cup of coffee or energy drink).

I am an INTJ-T scorpio 🦂 but overall I am a little ray of sunshine who likes to cheer on people; being kind and caring can make someone's day. I like memes, pranks and puns... I can be even a little bit racist and use too much dark humor.

In my free time I play videogames, watch anime, read mangas and take care of other people's pets when they are in vacation.

BMWs, bikes, bikers and nerdiness are a way to get to me 🤣.

We are constantly train him and we have been attending at a dog school for 2 months now. So all in all we are doing our best to make him a well behaving, balanced member of our family. We for sure made some mistakes, but none of them was serious. Here I must say that he was never phisically abused. He has been yelled at, but never hit.  
(he was the last one of the litter so we couldn't see his siblings. Mom was very calm and balanced dog)

He is hyperactive: non stop, constant ""100% usage of his brain"", he just can't stop. No matter if it was a lazy day or 1,5 hour full on running and playing with two herding dogs, he can't relax a minute. He might sleep half an hour but that's all. He lives in the house with us, but every day seems like his first day in there. He has a few spots in the house where he goes to sniff and to search for things, and he loops through them all the time. Can' sit on the sofa or lay in his bed for more than 2 minutes.

He is resource guarding: we never took valueable things from him like treats or toys, but we did take harmful or nasty things from him. He is a spaniel, he sniffs all the time and he finds everything he is not supposed to find. During walks, we were constantly stopping to get something out of his mouth. But toys or treats, never. He also was aggressive on time when I tried to move him off the couch. He obviously can't go on it since then. Things are so bad now. I dropped something random item, lets say a dart as I'm playing darts. He immediately went for it, and took it under the coffee table. He started growling as I tried to get it back from him...

Aggression due to fear or pain??: One time I accidentally layed on his tail. It was nothing serious at all. Instead of crying about it, he immediately tried to bite my face. Missed by 2 cm. He was like 8 months old.

I know cockers can be hell, even the cocker community is pretty divided (at least the one that I'm part of). Some say they are like this, some say it's the owners mistake.  
Our vet and dog trainer also sad that they are like this. (as he is trying to bite the vet too)

We have a private session with a dog trainer today as I clearly won't be able to solve this by myself, but until then I'm looking for some kind of opinion or advice. If I missed some crucial information about him or us, please feel free to ask and I'll answer it.",1,1745826913.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False

Espresso noob here. Love this sub Reddit and following for a while but my first post. I've recently purchased a Delonghi dedica ec885 along with a kinGrinder p1 so a starter setup. 

Watching a lot of online tutorials, I've been using 11g in and tried different grind settings. While the volume of the shot is more or less consistent around 30 but the time it takes is always different. For example I made one shot yesterday which took 22 seconds. All online stuff says that ideal time is 25-30 seconds so I grounded the coffee today slightly finer but it ended up taking 15 seconds this time.

What am I doing wrong or missing?

P.S. I start the timer not when I press the button but when I hear the first sound in the machine. ",1,1745826872.0,espresso,3,1.0,False
1k9q4pa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeDecorating/comments/1k9q4pa/most_unusual_decor_ideas_i_give_my_clients_which/,Most unusual decor ideas I give my clients (which actually wows them)!!,"Anytime I get a revamp of an old home as a project from Livspace, I get very excited. Not to entirely change it into a new space but to figure what I can use from the home and add it as a unique aspect to the new look. There are a few things that I usually suggest which are met with doubtful looks but after seeing the end result, all my clients, without fail, have pointed out that it was one of the best things in the house.



So, I figured since these are unpopular adds, I’ll share it here as well. 



Old ladders: They hold too much potential. Paint it and add it in the living room as a bookshelf. Keep it in the balcony as a plant holder, in the bedroom as a coat rack, in the bathroom as a towel rack, the list just goes on.

Mirrors: If you have smaller mirrors, use it as trays for jewellery or even as a centerpiece for the dining table by adding a nice frame.

Tyres: Take a couple of tyres, glue it together, add a coat of paint and turn it into an ottoman or coffee table. You can add a wood on top or just a cushion. If there is a garden area, you can use the tyre to plant some nice greens as well.

Vintage trunks or suitcases: Those heavy boxes are not that practical anymore for carrying stuff around but it works great as a coffee table or a statement piece.



I always love how I’m able to retain some of the house’s character by repurposing old things like these and it is one of the things that clients appreciate as well, knowing that they don’t lose that home feeling entirely. These are not for people who love the modern, minimalist approach, rather for people who like to have pieces that carry a story placed around the home. Let me know if there are other ideas like these that I should try in my next project.

suddenly, the driver burst out laughing — stopped the bus too —
then walked over to us, laughing, and right in front of me, he strangled the woman.

Here’s a recap: 

* Woke up at 5:45am (to snooze for awhile) for the train. Was greeted with puppy snuggles. I miss him already. I would have missed the train as the car wouldn’t start for awhile but the train was 20 mins late so I wound up early, phewf! 
* The train was good, I was able to sit on my own for most of it. I almost fell asleep a lot. I imagine/dreamed Andy texted me saying “well I thought I would have woken up to a lot of messages” but there was no such text so I guess I dreamed it. I felt like I was making weird facial expressions when my eyes were shut but again, not sure. My second train was also late! It felt like such good karma because the second was the perfect level of lateness that I basically went from one train to the next without really waiting long! 
* Then I worked and had a big catch up with M as I’ve not seen her for like three weeks. 
* Work work worrrrrkkkkk
* My laptop arrived!!! I love it. She’s so pretty. She’s all pinky, it’s the starlight colour which is a soft gold silver that ALMOST looks rose gold and then I’ve set it up to be all pink and pretty inside. 
* I skipped breakfast and lunch but had coffee and green tea and then I had a tofu green curry thing for dinner. 
* Ummmmm
* Yeah 

That’s it. 

I still feel weird about him. Or rather *us*, I should say. It almost feels like he’s actively trying to show disinterest in me…? He just said “I’m glad you like it” re my laptop for example, what a robotic response. Or like I’m some colleague he barely knows. I just feel like my existing with him lately is annoying and time consuming. It doesn’t feel like he wants a bar of me. Well whatever happens with us - my life didn’t start because of him and it won’t end because of him either. I want to say something but he’s just so intermittently unwell and it never feels like an okay time to bring it up. I just don’t want to be difficult while he’s dealing with all that, y’know?  Anyway whatever. 

I have therapy this week and I’m so relieved. I liked saving the money but I didn’t like missing the sessions.

Apparently I’m getting a $12k-$15k dividend payout around August! Yay! I got around $8k earlier in the year too. It definitely helps top up my paltry HR income.

We went to a camping music festival together a month after the break up. Substances and intense emotions led to a very messy situation. I can only describe that period of my life as cataclysmic. Went into a forced no contact period from December onwards (he just stopped talking to me). Only messaged about logistics 1-2 times. I was treated very badly towards the end of the relationship and during the break up and I was a shell of myself and in the lowest of lows. I needed intense therapy, time off work, a lot of inner work to be at peace today. I’m leaving the country that we’re both in for good and I’ve been debating whether to message him or not to say goodbye. I reached the conclusion that I wont message him and that there is nothing to salvage, I made peace with it and had nothing else to say to him. The other day however he messaged after almost 5 months of no contact. He said he knew I’d be leaving soon but got confirmation (from mutual friends) that there was a set date. He said he wants to get coffee now that his emotions have settled and has had a perspective change. He said he does want to have any bad blood between us.

For me this is too little too late. This conversation would have saved me weeks of distress had it happened a few months ago. There is bad blood and I’m at peace with it and I have nothing to say to him. A small part of me fears I might regret not having a true final conversation down the line. But I know this will also resurface a lot of emotions.

I am also seeing someone new who is an amazing, secure, healthy, stable presence in my life and I’m excited to explore and put energy into to it.

Back in high school, I was always the top student—felt like I was destined for big things. But when I got to university, everything changed. It took me six years to finish my bachelor’s in applied math because I lost motivation and discipline, just dragging myself through. I tried a master’s in statistics, but this January I dropped out.Even if I finished, my first job would only pay around $800 a month, which isn’t motivating after seeing what my father built. I want something scalable—something where my effort can actually grow, not just trade time for a small paycheck.after months of doing nothing, barely getting out of bed, procrastinating, and feeling totally lost. I’m an INFP, extremely introverted and analytical, with ADHD and social anxiety. Most days I just lie in bed, wake up late, scroll my phone, play games, maybe go out for coffee, but I don’t really connect with anyone. Even the few friends I have feel more like acquaintances. I’ve never had a real relationship with a girl—still a virgin, 260+ days nofap. I’ve tried talking to girls online, but it always ends in nothing, or I get rejected or friendzoned, and it just adds to this feeling of being left behind in life. I tried seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist once, but it didn’t help.

 
My dad came from nothing and built a $15 million real estate fortune—apartments and garages it's like 1B$+ here in Morocco since living cost is low.He actually passed away just one month after I was born, so I never really knew him, but I grew up always hearing about his success and feeling that pressure to live up to what he achieved. My share is about $600k, but almost everything is co-owned or legally linked with my siblings. A lot of the properties just sit unused, and when I suggest doing something with them, my siblings tell me to use my own money and not touch the “linked stuff.” If I tried to move abroad, I’d lose control of my share; there’s no way to manage from a distance, and honestly, I can’t fully trust my siblings not to mess things up or cut me out. If I sold my share to “escape,” I’d have to take a big loss and lose my long-term security. So I’m basically blocked from making anything happen with the inheritance and, at the same time, feel the pressure to “keep the legacy” and make my family proud. Right now, I only get about $1,000 a month from these properties, even though with good management it could be $5,000–6,000. I have $80,000 in cash sitting in the bank, but I haven’t invested or done anything with it because I’m scared of making the wrong move.

I’ve tried trading (mostly crypto, sometimes stocks)—had some wins, but more losses. I keep thinking maybe I could find my edge if I stuck with it, but nothing consistent yet. I’ve looked into businesses—coffee shops, car washes, workspace, vending, even food stalls—but all of them sound exhausting and require daily management, which just doesn’t fit my personality or energy. I’m not a salesman or a “people person,” and the idea of managing employees or dealing with headaches every day makes me feel trapped. The only thing that seems genuinely “safe” to me is using my $80k to buy one or two condos and rent them out monthly or weekly for steady income. I could actually manage those myself, without having to deal with my siblings or family drama.

My routines are a mess: I get inspired by business videos or podcasts and have a couple of good days, then slide right back into the cycle of bed, phone, self-hate, and guilt. I’m very reluctant to spend money on myself. I don’t care about luxury or status things and I don’t even have a car. Even when I think about rewarding myself with something small, I feel wrong or guilty, like I don’t deserve it or I’m betraying how I was raised.
.My family keeps seeing me as the one who should do great things, but I mostly feel like the black sheep or disappointment, especially compared to my siblings with their “normal” married lives and jobs. My motivation is unpredictable—sometimes I’m ready to grind hard if I know it’ll pay off, but more often I’m just paralyzed, scared I’ll waste years or burn through my cash on the wrong idea. I used to dream of going to the USA and being a quant, but now that feels impossible. I want to be richer than my dad one day, but I honestly don’t know if I have what it takes, or even what the first step should be.

I’m posting here because I’m genuinely lost and don’t know what to do next. If you’ve ever felt stuck between family expectations, money you can’t really use, and not knowing your purpose, how did you figure out your next move? Does playing it safe make sense, or is there a better way to find motivation and build a meaningful life when you feel trapped? I’m open to any honest stories, advice, or perspectives. What would you do in my place? I just need real direction from people who understand this kind of situation. Thanks for reading.

On my eighteenth birthday, my brothers brought home a seven-year-old orphan girl.  
  
Ethan Parker—my oldest brother—slapped me across the face because of her.  
  
Lucas, the middle one, shouted, ""Get out! Don't ever come back!""  
  
So I left.  
  
No fights. No goodbyes. Just packed my bags and walked out the door.  
  
They thought I was just being dramatic and would come crawling back in a few days.  
  
Finally rid of me, they took Lily Thompson abroad—to Norway.  
  
It was the one place I'd always dreamed of visiting, just to see the Northern Lights.  
  
Weeks later, they came back to an unexpected headline:  
  
I'd joined a top-secret, ten-year medical research program.  
  
And I could never come home again.  
  
That night, everything fell apart for them.  
  
...  
  
I booked a one-way ticket on the day of the Lantern Festival.  
  
Professor Knox walked me to the gates of the research institute. His voice was kind, almost fatherly.  
  
""You leave in seven days, Paige. If there's someone you're still holding onto… go say goodbye.""  
  
Spring had technically arrived in North City, but the air still bit like winter.  
  
I stood on the curb for what felt like forever.  
  
Then, against every ounce of pride I had left, I pulled out my phone and called my second brother—Lucas.  
  
We hadn't spoken in years. But we'd been family for over two decades.  
  
No matter how bad things had gotten, I thought maybe… one last meal together wasn't too much to ask.  
  
He hung up.  
  
I tried again. Then again.  
  
The third time, his phone went straight to voicemail.  
  
I took a breath and called Ethan.  
  
The line rang for so long I almost gave up—until he finally picked up.  
  
It felt less like answering and more like he was doing me a favor.  
  
Worried he'd hang up, I rushed out the words.  
  
""It's the Lantern Festival. I was thinking… maybe we could have dinner together at home?""  
  
I remembered the housekeeper was off for the holiday, so I quickly added,  
  
""I'll cook. I'll make glutinous rice balls—with strawberry filling. Lily's favorite.""  
  
Lily Thompson. The little girl they chose over me.  
  
Ethan's voice was sharp. Distant.  
  
""Because of you, Lily's still in the hospital. And you think now's the time to celebrate?""  
  
I tried to ignore the anger in his voice. Pretended I didn't hear it.  
  
""Then... I'll bring the rice balls to the hospital. We can eat together there?""  
  
I'd never begged like this before.  
  
Not even when they turned their backs on me.  
  
Not when they replaced me.  
  
But now… I was leaving for good. And who knew if we'd ever cross paths again?  
  
There was a long pause.  
  
And then, faintly, I heard Lily's small voice in the background:  
  
""Big sister's strawberry rice balls are yummy.""  
  
I latched onto it like a lifeline. ""Then I'll make them. I'll bring them over.""  
  
Before anyone could object, I hung up.  
  
Chapter 2The call ended, and the cold wind made my eyes sting.  
  
On the way to the hospital, I stopped to pick up ingredients, rushed home to cook, packed everything neatly into containers, and headed straight back out.  
  
The private hospital room had a tiny dining table—just big enough to squeeze three people around it. Ethan Parker looked up when I walked in.  
  
Before he could say anything, I grabbed a small bowl, went to the window, and sat on the ledge to eat alone.  
  
Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a flicker of something—surprise, maybe—on his face.  
  
But it disappeared just as fast.  
  
He turned his attention back to Lily Thompson, carefully ladling out soup-filled rice balls for her and placing a spoon in her hand. The chairs looked stiff and uncomfortable, so Lucas grabbed a pillow and tucked it behind her back.  
  
Lily, still a sugar-loving kid, devoured the strawberry-filled rice balls like they were candy. She ate too fast and started coughing.  
  
I instinctively looked over.  
  
Lucas immediately patted her back while Ethan got up to pour her a glass of warm water.  
  
""Slow down,"" Lucas said with a laugh. ""Nobody's taking them from you.""  
  
Their voices were full of warmth, mock-scolding her like proud, doting dads.  
  
It was a familiar scene—painfully so.  
  
Once upon a time, I'd been the one in Lily's place.  
  
I forgot to look away.  
  
Ethan must've felt me staring. After handing Lily the water, he glanced in my direction.  
  
The moment our eyes met, his expression turned cold.  
  
Like a door slamming shut.  
  
It hit harder than I expected.  
  
I dropped my gaze and took another bite, only to choke on the filling. My throat tightened, and a coughing fit took over before I could stop it.  
  
Ethan didn't even flinch. ""You want water too?""  
  
His tone was flat. Almost bored.  
  
I bit down the urge to say something—anything—and forced myself to stop coughing.  
  
Laughter filled the room again, light and easy.  
  
Lily perked up mid-bite. ""We learned about the Northern Lights in literature class last week!""  
  
""They said you can see them in Norway during winter. I really wanna go someday!""  
  
Ethan reached over and ruffled her hair. ""Why wait? We'll take you this year.""  
  
Lucas grinned. ""Perfect timing. We've both got vacation at the end of the year. It's a plan.""  
  
My fingers trembled as I gripped my bowl. Maybe it was the heat. Or maybe not. Either way, I nearly dropped it.  
  
Within thirty minutes, they had flights booked.  
  
Lily squealed and flung herself into their arms, beaming.  
  
Then, as if suddenly remembering I was there, she looked over. ""Paige, you'll come too, right?""  
  
I hesitated—then realized this was my chance.  
  
""I can't. In a few days, I'm leaving with Professor Knox—""  
  
Ethan cut me off, his voice curt. ""We don't need a rundown of your plans.""  
  
The words I'd been holding—I might not be back for a long time—died in my throat.  
  
Then, as if something just occurred to him, he turned to me, his eyes cool.  
  
""Lily's getting discharged tomorrow.""  
  
""Since you're the one who hurt her, it wouldn't be right for her to stay somewhere unfamiliar.""  
  
""I'll ask the housekeeper to prep the guest room—""  
  
""I'll clear out the master bedroom for her,"" I said, cutting in before he could finish.  
  
Ethan froze mid-sentence.  
  
He looked at me for a long second. Confused. Suspicious. Almost like he didn't believe what he'd just heard.  
  
""…What?""  
  
Chapter 3Lucas Parker paused, brows knitting together.  
  
He probably thought I was being dramatic. His voice carried that familiar edge of exasperation.  
  
""There's no need for this.""  
  
""I know how petty you can be. Once Lily's better, she'll move out.""  
  
I met their eyes steadily. ""Let her stay.""  
  
""She's young. She needs someone to keep an eye on her. This way, you won't have to run back and forth all the time.""  
  
""And it's not like I've spent much time at home these past few years. The master bedroom's more comfortable—it makes sense for her to have it.""  
  
Bang.  
  
Ethan Parker slammed the takeout container onto the coffee table, the sharp crack slicing through my words.  
  
His jaw tightened. His whole expression darkened, like he was sure I was just playing games again.  
  
Lily, full and drowsy, yawned and tugged on Ethan's sleeve. ""Read me a story?""  
  
Lucas quietly began clearing the table.  
  
Ethan helped Lily back into bed, grabbed one of her favorite books, and sat beside her.  
  
Same old scene. Like hundreds of nights before.  
  
And once again, I was just... there. Out of place. Unwelcome.  
  
I stood and grabbed my bag from the chair.  
  
My throat felt tight as I said quietly, ""I'm heading out.""  
  
No one said a word.  
  
Lucas continued wiping the table. Ethan's voice stayed soft and steady as he read.  
  
I walked toward the door, brushing past Ethan.  
  
His head stayed low, eyes on the pages.  
  
I couldn't see his face.  
  
The last thing I heard before stepping out was his voice:  
  
""And so, Snow White was cast out of her home…""  
  
For some reason, it hit harder than it should've.  
  
My mind flashed back to the night our parents died in the fire.  
  
Ethan had wrapped his arms around me, voice raw and shaky, whispering:  
  
""You still have us.""  
  
""As long as we're here, Paige... you'll always have a home.""  
  
Liar.  
  
My nose stung before I even realized it.  
  
I didn't stop walking.  
  
That night, I went straight back to campus and threw myself into work. Buried myself in the lab, wrapping up the last phase of an experiment.  
  
Seven days left.  
  
Just one more week to finish everything—school, research, my personal mess.  
  
I worked straight through the night.  
  
By morning, after a short nap on the lab couch, I went home.  
  
There was still the matter of clearing the master bedroom.  
  
The housekeeper helped me move into one of the guest rooms, muttering under her breath the whole time.  
  
""Since when does the outsider get the master bedroom, and the family ends up in the guest room?""  
  
As I packed my books and clothes into a suitcase, I shrugged.  
  
""It's fine. I won't be here much longer anyway.""  
  
Then came a voice—cold, sharp, cutting through the air like glass.  
  
""Where do you think you're going?""",1,1745825495.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1k9ptpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k9ptpf/i_read_the_wrong_mind_now_the_ghoul_hunts_me/,I Read the Wrong Mind. Now the Ghoul Hunts Me,"
Guys, I have to write this down, right now. I don't know if I'll finish, I don't know who will even believe me, but I have to try. Someone needs to know. My name is Adam, just a regular young guy like anyone else here in Cairo, maybe the only difference is… I have a gift? A curse? I don't know what to call it. I can hear people's thoughts. Yes, exactly like that. I read what's inside their heads.

It started when I was a kid. I thought they were hallucinations at first, voices inside my head that weren't mine. With time, I understood I was hearing the thoughts of those around me. It was terrifying initially, then it became amusing, then… an addiction. You can't imagine the amount of nonsense, drama, and crazy daydreams swirling in people's minds while you're just walking down the street or riding the metro. I used to entertain myself with them – finding out who hated their boss, who was cheating on their spouse, who was sick of their life, who was planning to skip work. I felt like a superhero sometimes, or maybe a little devil, eavesdropping on their deepest secrets with nobody the wiser. It gave me a sense of power, of being special… a feeling that I was different, that I saw the truth behind people's masks.

I was addicted to that feeling. I reached a point where I couldn't interact with anyone without taking a ""peek"" inside their head first. Know their intentions, know what they really thought of me. I started judging people based on their thoughts, not their words or actions. Sometimes I'd discover incredibly kind souls hidden inside, other times I'd crash into an indescribable amount of malice, spite, and hatred concealed behind fake smiles. It was like the internet, a vast ocean full of good and bad, but I focused more on the bad – it was more entertaining, more dramatic.

I know it's wrong. I know it's rude and a violation of privacy, but I couldn't resist. Like someone who discovers they can open any locked door – naturally, they'll try every door. I felt like the director watching the backstage chaos of life's daily play. Sometimes I used it to my advantage – figuring out what the professor would focus on in an exam, finding out if the girl I liked thought about me (which usually ended in disappointment), knowing if someone was trying to cheat me in a deal. But mostly, I used it for pure amusement. Like scrolling through Facebook and seeing people's scandals and problems, I did that live, directly from the source.

About a month ago, I started feeling a bit bored. All the thoughts became repetitive – same worries, same problems, same trivialities. I felt like someone watching the same movie every day. Until I met him.

I was at the Sadat metro station, crowded as usual, the air thick with the smell of sweat, cheap perfume, and cigarette smoke. While waiting for the train, I noticed a man standing a bit off to the side, alone. He looked completely ordinary, maybe a bit rugged. Worn-out jeans, a faded t-shirt, sharp, typically Egyptian features, but nothing particularly attention-grabbing. Maybe late thirties, early forties. He wasn't doing anything special, just standing there, looking towards the tunnel where the train arrives, like everyone else. But there was something strange about him, an aura of calm and intense focus amidst all the noise. People around him were shouting, talking, laughing, and he was completely oblivious, like he was in another world.

Curiosity killed me, as usual. I thought I'd just ""take a look,"" see what this guy was thinking about. I focused on him, like I always do, like aiming a satellite dish to receive a specific channel. And in an instant, I was inside his head.

Oh my God.

The voice I heard inside my mind wasn't like any voice I'd heard before. There were no worries about work or problems at home or idle daydreams. There was… sharp focus, like a laser beam. And images. Images flashing by with terrifying speed. A dark alleyway. Hurried footsteps. Short, ragged breaths. Then… a muffled scream. Blood. So much blood.

I flinched, taking a step back. My heart was pounding. What was that? What did I just hear? I tried again, more cautiously this time.

The thoughts were clearer… and more horrifying. ""Have to find him tonight… won't escape me again… must finish him… this filth needs to be cleaned up… his rotten stench fills the place… but where?… must focus…"". These words repeated like a broken record, mixed with images of bloody violence, distorted faces, disgusting things I couldn't quite identify. But the constant theme was the determination to ""cleanse,"" to ""get rid of"" something or someone he described with the foulest terms.

The train arrived, people pushed forward as usual. I saw him move calmly and board the train. A shiver ran down my spine. This man wasn't normal. These weren't the thoughts of an ordinary person. These were the thoughts of… a killer. Maybe a serial killer? The idea made my stomach churn. For the first time since discovering my ""gift,"" I felt real fear. Fear not just for myself, but fear of what this man might do.

I got on the same train, standing a little distance away, but keeping my eyes on him. Every few minutes, I'd ""peek"" into his mind again. Same bloody thoughts, same terrifying focus. He was like a predator stalking its prey. Who was his prey? And why did he want to kill them so brutally?

""I have to watch him."" That was the decision I made right then. A strange sense of responsibility suddenly fell upon me. I was the only one who knew what this man was thinking. I was the only one who could possibly stop him. Part of me was terrified and wanted to run as far away as possible, but the larger part – the curious part addicted to thrills, and the part that suddenly felt like a hero – was determined to see this through.

He got off at a station near downtown, and I followed him. He walked through side streets, his steps quick and steady. I followed cautiously, trying not to be noticed. He entered a small, dingy local cafe, sitting at a table in a dark corner by himself. I ordered something to drink and sat further away, pretending to read something on my phone, but all my focus was on him.

I entered his mind again. The thoughts were a bit calmer now, but still held the same intensity. ""Getting closer… I can feel him… in this area… must be patient… he'll show up… has to show up to feed… hunger will expose him…"". Feed? Feed on what? Or who? This talk was amplifying my terror. This man was definitely dangerously insane.

I continued to watch him over the following days. It turned into an obsession. I started skipping college, lying to my family, just so I could follow him. He moved around a lot, different areas in Cairo, always alone, always with the same deadly focus. I found out his name was ""Aziz"" – or at least, that's the name I heard someone call him once when he was buying something from a kiosk. In my head, I started calling him ""Aziz the Ripper.""

Every day, I felt closer to understanding his plan. He was looking for someone specific. Someone who moved around constantly. Someone Aziz was determined to find and kill. The thoughts I heard in his head were filled with details about this potential victim's habits, possible locations, ways to trap them. He described this person with disgusting terms: ""the parasite,"" ""the hidden one,"" ""the carrion eater."" I interpreted all of this as him trying to dehumanize his victim to make the act of killing easier, just like serial killers do.

I started painting a picture of this victim in my mind. Surely someone weak, alone, that's why Aziz chose them. Maybe homeless, maybe a loner. I began to feel pity for this unknown victim, and at the same time, rage towards Aziz. How could someone be this evil?

I reached a point where I knew where he was going before he even went there. I'd memorized his thought patterns and plans that well. And one day, I felt it – tonight was the night. His thoughts were all centered around one location: an old, forgotten cemetery on the outskirts of Cairo. An area known for being unsafe at night.

""Tonight… must finish him tonight… in his favorite place… among the dead, just like him… he won't escape… I'll corner him…"". These thoughts were like gunshots in my head. I knew he intended to commit his crime there.

Fear gripped me and wouldn't let go. What should I do? Call the police? How would they believe me? Tell them I read minds and I know a guy is going to kill someone else in the cemetery? They'd think I was crazy and lock me up. No, I had to act myself. I had to stop him.

I went to the cemetery just before sunset. A gloomy, desolate place. Graves were broken and scattered, weeds and wild grass grew everywhere. The smell of dirt and decay hung heavy in the air. I hid behind a large, broken tombstone and waited. My heart felt like it would burst from fear and anticipation.

After about an hour, as darkness began to cloak the place, I spotted a figure approaching from a distance. It was Aziz. Walking with the same confident, steady steps. I quickly dove into his mind. ""Close… very close… the scent is stronger… hungry… looking for easy prey… but I'll be the one waiting…"".

Easy prey? Oh God, he wasn't just planning to kill his target, it seemed like he was looking for anyone else too! This man was far more dangerous than I had imagined.

A little later, I heard other footsteps approaching from a different direction. Light, cautious steps. I saw another silhouette drawing near, indistinct in the darkness. Aziz saw it too. His entire body tensed, like a lion spotting its quarry. I tuned into Aziz's mind again. ""There he is… in the flesh… hiding in human form… but I see him… see his disgusting truth… tonight's your end, you son of a bitch…"".

Hiding in human form? What did that mean? The words were strange. But I didn't dwell on it then, my only concern was that a life was about to be extinguished. The second figure got closer, and its features became slightly clearer. It was an old man, or looked like one, walking with a slight limp, clutching a black plastic bag. He looked so pathetic, like a beggar or some poor soul.

Aziz began to move slowly towards him, like a predator closing in. He pulled something long and thin from under his clothes; it glinted in the faint moonlight filtering through the clouds. It looked like a long metal spike or a very large switchblade.

This was it. He was going to do it. This poor old man was going to die right now. I couldn't stand it. I had to do something.

In a moment of madness, or maybe courage, or maybe stupidity, I burst out from behind the tombstone and screamed at the top of my lungs: ""LOOK OUT!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING???""

Aziz spun around, shock mixed with fury on his face. The old man also stopped and looked at me. For a second, time froze.

""You?! What the hell are you doing here, you idiot? Get back!"" That was Aziz's voice, laced with warning and anger.

""I won't let you kill him! You murderer!"" I yelled, moving towards him, not knowing what I intended to do – maybe hit him, maybe distract him until the old man could escape.

""Kill him? Kill who, you moron? You don't understand anything! Get away!"" Aziz yelled at me again, but his eyes darted back to the old man, who was just standing there, watching us with a strange coldness.

And in the instant Aziz turned his attention to me, the old man moved. But it wasn't the movement of a limping old man. It was fast, terrifyingly fast, unnaturally fast. In the blink of an eye, he was right in front of Aziz.

And I heard a sound… a sickening crack. The sound of bones breaking. And I saw something I will never forget as long as I live. The old man's face began to… change. To stretch and contort. His eyes turned into burning red embers, his mouth opened impossibly wide, revealing rows of needle-sharp teeth like nails. His thin, wrinkled hands became long, black claws. The plastic bag dropped from his grasp, and I heard the clatter of something hitting the ground… bones?

Aziz was trying to fight back, striking with the metal spike, but this… thing was much faster, much stronger. I heard Aziz scream, not in pain, no, but in rage and despair: ""Ghoul!! You son of a ***! I knew it!!""

Ghoul? What did that mean? I was frozen solid, unable to move, unable to process what I was seeing. This wasn't a horror movie; this was real! The man I thought was a serial killer, the man I was trying to ""save"" a victim from… he was hunting a real monster! And the pathetic old man I intervened to protect… he was the monster!

This creature, this Ghoul, grabbed Aziz by the neck and lifted him into the air like a rag doll. Aziz was flailing, gasping for breath. His eyes met mine for a fraction of a second. I saw a look in them… not blame, not exactly, but despair and terror for my fate. As if saying: ""See what you've done? You caused this!"".

And then… with a sickening ripping sound, like wet cloth tearing… the Ghoul tore Aziz's head from his body.

Blood sprayed everywhere. Aziz's body crumpled to the ground like a heap of meat, his head landed a moment later, eyes still wide open, staring right at me.

I was still standing there, petrified, my mind refusing to believe it. Everything happened so fast. All those thoughts I'd heard in Aziz's head… ""the filth,"" ""the parasite,"" ""hiding in human form,"" ""his rotten stench,"" ""must finish him""… none of it was a description of a human victim. It was a literal description of the terrifying entity standing before me now. Aziz wasn't a serial killer… he was a hunter. A Ghoul hunter. And I… I had killed him. With my stupid intervention, I had sentenced him to death.

The Ghoul casually tossed Aziz's head aside. And then… it turned towards me.

Oh, God. The look in its eyes. There was no anger, no human expression at all. There was… hunger. A cold, primal, absolute hunger. And a smile. A wide smile revealing all its pointed teeth, dripping thick, black, viscous saliva.

""You…"" The voice that came out wasn't the old man's voice, wasn't even human. It was a deep, guttural rasp, like grinding stones. ""…smell… good… like the hunter… but softer… you'll make… a… tasty… meal…""

In that instant, my legs started working on their own. Pure, unadulterated fear-adrenaline surged through me. I turned and started running. Running like a madman among the broken graves, unable to see clearly, the only thought in my head was to get away from this nightmare. Behind me, I heard heavy, fast footsteps, and the sound of the Ghoul's horrifying, rasping laughter.

""Won't… escape… me… I… smelled you… now…""

I kept running and running, I don't know how I got out of that cemetery and reached the street. I jumped into the first taxi I saw and screamed at the driver to just go, fast, anywhere far away from here. The driver kept glancing at me nervously in the rearview mirror; my face must have been deathly pale, my clothes covered in dirt, maybe even blood. I couldn't say anything, I was shaking too badly to form words.

I got out somewhere I didn't recognize and just wandered the streets like a lost soul, looking over my shoulder every few seconds, feeling like it was following me, feeling like it could see me. My mind kept replaying the image of Aziz's severed head, the image of the Ghoul smiling at me. It was my fault. I did this. If I had just let Aziz do his job, that monster would be dead now. But my curiosity, my ego, my false sense of heroism… they led to this.

I ended up in an internet cafe, sat here until morning. Ordered coffee, don't know how I drank it. My hands are still shaking. I started writing this post; someone has to know. Someone has to believe me.

I don't know what to do now. I killed the only person who could have protected me from that thing. And that Ghoul… it saw my face. It smelled me. It said it wouldn't forget me. It said I smelled good.

It's looking for me now, I'm sure of it. I can feel it. I feel its cold gaze on me even as I sit here among people in this cafe. Every face I see, I suspect it might be the Ghoul, hidden in another form. Every footstep behind me makes me jump.

I'm the new prey. The hunter is dead, and the monster is hungry.

I'm writing this, and my hands are trembling. I don't know what I'll do or where I'll go. I feel like my end is near. I hear footsteps outside the cafe… heavy steps… unnatural…

I have to stop now… I feel someone watching me from the window… its eyes… its eyes are red…

Oh God, help me… If anyone reads this… please… be careful… The monsters are among us… and don't believe everything you see or hear… even inside your own head…

Forgive me…

I'm starting this thread because if anyone has any advice and ideas or experience in the case of Gastritis, please share!! 

Here's mine because I've accumulated some knowledge over the past 2 years and what use is it if I don't share it somewhere, right? 

I've had gastritis type C for 1.5 years so far and my main advice I can give you is to not rely solely on regular doctors for remedies and advice. I AM NOT INSTRUCTING ANYONE TO TAKE THESE MEDICATIONS IT IS JUST ADVICE. (Community guidelines.)

Won't get into it because it's a long story, but let's just say doctors can often be worth jack when it comes to long term Illnesses and I'd be better off if I'd never gone to one and instead gone straight my natural doctor. She prescribed me a stool sample kit and multiple homeopathic medications and made future steps / treatments / plans for the future, instead of my doctors at the practice who 1) misdiagnosed me for several months 2) kept our appointments to five minutes or shorter 3) NEVER even suggested doing a stool sample 4) shoved pills in my face while promising me 'it'll be better in two weeks.' 

It's been over 1.5 years and lemme tell you, that false hope they prescribed me was almost as bad as the pain. 

If you do want to keep going to a regular doctor that's up to you, but do yourself a few favors please, and get a stool sample done, and maybe even a colonoscopy / gastroscopy if you've got the money. 

Also very important: figure out what TYPE of gastritis you have. If you unknowingly have gastritis type C, like me, then taking any form of pain medication can only worsen it. 

But please, if you want to get through this at all, see a natural doctor too. I would donate money to my natural doctor, and I would give all the money in my bank account just to go back to 1.5 years ago and see a natural doctor. 

Also: take care of your stress / anxiety levels. Stay away from things and people that exacerbate your stress. If your job stresses you out, try to implement habits to make it less stressful. 

Pantoprazole is your best friend. While I do suggest natural remedies as well, an anti-acid is CRUCIAL. 

Hot water bottles: stock up. Maybe get an electric one and bring it with you to work. Bring one to friends houses, just use them. 

Diet:  stay away from coffee and alcohol. Also stay away from acidic foods if possible: even oranges, lemon juice, and tomatoes can make it worse. But everybody is different. Tomatoes are fine for me but lemons are horrible. 

I'll write a list below of foods that work and don't work for me personally, but remember: everyone is different. Try it yourself and keep a list. !!

Hunger pains: you might experience these stabbing twisting gut wrenching pains I like to call 'hunger pains' because not only does it make me feel like a peasant in the 1600's who hasn't eaten in 10 days, but no matter how much I eat it won't go away. (Doctors had no idea why I was having these. Natural doctor knew exactly what I meant and said the natural remedies could help with that). If you experience them, first check that it's not appendix pain, Google how to check for a burst appendix. My hunger pains last for several hours. I make a hot water bottle and lie my stomach down on top of it while lying on the floor. I drink lots of warm water and eat plain foods like rice cakes, fiber cereal, bananas, etc. nothing really helps but eventually I fall asleep and it's fine again in the morning. 

Nausea: I had nausea for about a month, taking pantoprazole again helped as well as Vomex and eating mostly oatmeal. 

Small meals: small meals are key. You can eat several small meals throughout the day if you're hungry, but don't eat large portions / meals. Trust me. 

Bloating: there's gonna be a lot of it. If you don't have comfy loose pants / skirts / shorts / shirts you can wear everywhere, get some. 

Tea: stay away from caffeinated teas (green tea, black tea). I drink a lot of ginger tea with turmeric and honey, as well as fennel/anise tea. 

Immune system: for me personally, between gastritis and stress, I've been sick dozens of times in the past 1.5 years. I've had ear infections, UTI's, a stomach flu ironically, fevers, colds, diarrhea for days, and more. It's going to suck, but maybe it won't be this way for you. Take a vitamin C drop supplement, eat healthy, get in some walks outside, destressing is key. Take care of yourself. 

Sleep: as much as possible. Don't be ashamed to take naps and sleep in when you can. Sleep heals. 

Distractions: sometimes the only thing you can do against pain. Whatever it is for you, Netflix, phone games, painting, music, use it when you can and when you're in severe pain. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and when the pain is unbearable, sometimes you gotta bed-rot with a hot water bottle, and have some much needed escape from reality. 

Remember that everyone is different. For example: the gastritis diet isn't the same for all. For other people, chocolate is a no-go. For me, dark chocolate is one of few sweet things that has zero bad reactions. No bloating, pain, diarrhea, etc. try things, make lists. 

Fiber: GET A LOT OF IT. Beans are super for gastritis and filled with fiber and protein. 

Okay so. Diet. Here's a list of foods that work well for me and a list that don't. Everyone's different!!! But maybe it'll help you have some ideas because believe me, the prospect of tasteless food is no one's idea of a good time. 

Optimal foods: 
- rice cakes (can top with hummus, nut spreads, bananas, raisins, seeds, etc)

- oatmeal (I make a delicious carrot cake oatmeal recipe with oats, almond milk, shredded carrot, raisins, walnuts, chia seeds, flax seeds, agave syrup, and a pumpkin spice seasoning blend)

- BRAT (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast)

- bean chickpea chili (without spicy-ness) 

- eggs, scrambled or hard boiled. 

- yogurt (Greek low fat yogurt is perfect PERFECT for gastritis. I make mine with chia seeds and blueberries and a no-sugar seed granola from Aldi) 

- oat flour pancakes 

- veggie soups / pasta 

- chicken, Turkey

- fiber cereals (no sugar) 

- apples, blueberries, watermelon, corn, beans, bell peppers, spinach, cucumbers....

- dark chocolate works for me but not everyone. 

- nuts and seeds as well as nut butters (no added sugars)

- agave syrup for sweetening 

- gluten free spinach pizza (sometimes you only got time for a frozen pizza, for me gluten free pizzas go over better even though I'm not gluten intolerant) 

- cottage cheese, low fat cream cheese, kefir (great for good bacteria!)

- sweet potatoes, rice

- milk rice (I make milk rice topped with agave and blueberries for something sweet!)

- chia seed pudding (I have a killer recipe for the most delicious chia seed pudding: 600 grams low fat cottage cheese, 100 grams cream cheese, 250 grams low fat Greek yogurt, splash of milk, then add agave syrup to taste, a splash of lemon juice, a little vanilla extract to taste and blend in a blender. Pour into a Tupperware, add as much chia seeds as your heart desires, I also add frozen blueberries, and store in fridge for a few hours. This recipe makes several servings and it's so good, been eating it for months and my stomach loves it.)

- baked Turkey meatballs with homemade Greek yogurt tzatziki and veggies and rice

- egg and veggie scramble on toast 


Painful foods: (for me)

- zucchini ??? No idea why it affects me badly but it does. 

- sugary foods / foods with fake ingredients / artificial sweeteners 

- coffee, alcohol, caffeinated tea, tap water, (I boil my water and store it in milk jugs, since I don't have a filter and it goes down better on my stomach), lemonade, soda, (any fizzy drinks), sparkling water 

- fried foods / oily foods (get a mini air fryer if you like fried stuff! It works!) 

- spicy foods 

- ice cream, heavy cream


That's mostly it for food. Sometimes I have bad phases where I can only eat oatmeal and bananas. But it always ends. Everything ends and so will this. 

Most important is to take care of yourself. Treat yourself like a freaking god, I don't care, just be patient and be gentle.  I hope some of this can help someone out there, even just a little bit. 

And if anyone has advice or suggestions, please please share!! 

I wish you all luck <3 GO REST, YOU DESERVE IT.

Horrible experience at this so-called “premium” restaurant.

We were just two people looking to enjoy a simple coffee. Only reason we’ve ever chosen this place is because of its location—but every visit has been disappointing, and this one was the worst. Would like to also mention foreigners are treated very well, while they IGNORE other  CUSTOMERS.

We were asked to sit at a 4-person table because the 2-person one was dirty (recurring issue here). Minutes later, a rude and angry waiter approached us and said, “Why are you sitting here? This is for four people,” even though we were directed there by another staff member. The restaurant was half-empty, but the waiter still made a fuss.

He also made a strange, judgmental comment: “Alcohol won’t be served in this section,” even though we never asked for alcohol and don’t drink. Not only was it unnecessary, it felt like an insult.
When we asked him to clean the dirty table, he snapped, “I’ve cleaned this!” and refused to wipe it again—despite it being visibly sticky with tree sap and old food. The entire interaction felt like a roadside argument. 

This yelling, directed at a woman, shows lack of professionalism and training the staff has. It’s like they picked people off the street and put them in uniforms.

When we asked what the issue was, he simply muttered “OK.” No apology. No accountability.

We decided to leave.

Cleanliness continues to be a major issue. The washroom is disgusting—comparable to a highway rest stop. Worse, it’s a shared men’s and women’s washroom, which raises serious safety and privacy concerns.

Before walking out, we asked to speak to the manager—only to be told the manager wasn’t present. Again, no apology. Just more indifference.

Despite all this, the bill still includes a service charge. For what, exactly? For being treated poorly?

What’s worse is that this isn’t a one-off. We’ve visited a few times in the past, hoping for change —but the issues remain exactly the same. Management refuses to address or fix anything. They’re content milking the location

We also know many people who’ve stopped visiting for the exact same reasons. We made the mistake of thinking, “How bad could a coffee be?” Turns out—very.

Recurring issues we've experienced:
* Dirty washrooms, every single time.
* Unclean tables, with staff ignoring them entirely.
* Rude, inattentive waiters who act like serving you is a personal favor.
* Excessive delays: we’ve waited over 25 minutes for two coffees.
* Food customizations are always met with vague excuses and resistance.
* Once, dirt literally fell into our food while staff cleaned leaves above us on the catch nets.
* Outdoor seating isn’t fully covered—sit in the wrong spot, and wind will blow leaves and dirt onto your table. If you ask for a replacement, they’ll measure on your plate and give back only what was left. Cheapness.

The only thing they serve fast? The bill—with the service charge, of course (if you can even get hold of the staff between their gossip sessions).

They demand your phone number, but give vague responses when you ask why. Just be honest and admit it’s for selling data.

This place has clearly downsized, and it’s no surprise.Management doesn’t care.

BUT Foreigners are treated very well here. I have seen the all the waiters personally run after them for service, including continuous visits from I presume the head waiter, asking them about their experience. ALL WHILE IGNORING .INDIAN. CUSTOMERS. Such an experience in 2025. Pathetic.

Skip it. The two cafés next door offer far better service, better hygiene, and a much more respectful experience.

Pathetic. Avoid.

This is fresh off a breakup and no sleep so I apologize for not being able to fully articulate my thoughts better or throwing unnecessary information in, I’m aware of the answer I’ll receive but I wanted to at least share my reasoning and thoughts behind it all, whether or not she sees this or if I’ll get the chance to ever experience this love again doesn’t matter I just feel the need to write something.


I (27m) started talking with a new group of friends online and became infatuated with one of them, spending nearly every single day together for months.

We met online on an old private server for a video game, (she will eventually find this post since she’s a proud enjoyer of AITAH content - along with the others in the ex friend group) I’ll call her C for privacy. 

C(28f) was amazing, she started off cold and distant, barely joking or speaking to me but slowly started talking to me nonstop and spending a lot of time together, sharing time in the game and slowly talking beyond games about life in general. She went on a trip overseas and shared her phone number with me so we could continue to chat and play little iPhone games to pass the time, sending me pictures of places she would go, food she would eat, and slowly warming up to each other. 

A couple months go by of constant conversation(s) and the group has plans to meet up for a convention, which I am invited to go, I say yes almost immediately so I can finally meet the people I hang out with nearly every day/night in person and go to a convention for the first time.

The trip lasts for about a week, the convention was exciting and the friends were wonderful, I stuck to C the entire time like a lost puppy afraid of getting separated while holding onto her stuff and making sure she’s okay throughout the trip. I confide into the other friends that I have feelings for her and they tell me that C’s not really a relationship person and that she has a magpie brain fully engulfing herself with whatever distraction is around at the time and not to think too hard about her time spent with me. 

A few days go by in the trip and on the last day, we all take shots where she gets near immediately tipsy and heads to bed early, on the night I attempted to talk to her about my feelings for her. 

Chickening out, whether it’s good or bad luck, my flight gets delayed and I’m forced to stay another day there and finally confess my feelings for her that night where we come to an understanding and attempt a relationship as long as I work towards moving out there and packing up my entire life to make this relationship work. I leave the trip now in a relationship with C and feel the happiest I’ve ever been. 

I start working on certifications and other things with my resume to start applying towards places out there and start saving to move and get everything prepared, months go by of us getting into little fights and arguments but mostly everything stays perfect and we meet up more times, where we all get together for thanksgiving and spend a week together getting closer and further turning this relationship into a reality. 

The job search continues to suck but I completed more certifications and with the help of C, spruced up my resume to make it more appealing and found a little more success getting interviews and calls in this overflowing market of competition. We continue to send gifts back and forth and plan our time together, when in march C asks if I want to come spend the week with her during a time in April, which I immediately agree to since we haven’t seen each other since the start of December and book my flight. 

The trip was beautiful; We spent so much money on food back and forth, we were both enablers wanting to go everywhere. We went this one croissant place that was so good she dropped me off to get back in line for more, started ordering coffees at shops nearby just to see which one had the best “sweet/vanilla” lattes, I tried Peking duck for the first time, she even found a manga set of a childhood manga she liked in some remote bookstore by the ocean. 

We rated our favorite food spots and went to a Tea place 7(seven) times during our trip, loving every second of it. I’d wake up every morning at (or before depending on the screaming) 7am to feed her cat and make sure he was fed at night as well, unfortunately he didn’t warm up to me until the end of the trip where he would actively jump on the bed with us and just stare, but it’s okay bc C would just grab him and pull him in between us to cuddle. 

There is so much more that I can’t possibly list off just know that this relationship, to the both of us, was entirely real and I was(still am) madly in love with C and will forever cherish her and everything that happened between us.

Here’s where the AITAH comes into play, even though it’s a Yes;

I lied to her near immediately into the friendship, and lied to our friend group as well. I have a child from a past relationship that was fully toxic, she was both verbally and physically abusive to me threatening me with leaving or self pain on every disagreement or argument, pulling me further from my family and cried to me nightly telling me how she wanted a child and a family of her own because of her family being toxic and her mother being on Drugs/Alcohol and in and out of prison her entire life. I didn’t know how bad the relationship was until I looked away at it from a different perspective but by then it was too late, we were having a child together and I continued to stay and try for that relationship to work. Needless to say it obviously did not work out and I fortunately got out of that relationship, with many regrets. I do share custody with my ex and my son is 3 years old now. 

The reason I lied and kept this hidden for so long was because whenever we(the friend group) were all together some way some how, someone would make a comment about kids and how they’re all like “yeah gross, I’d never want kids, I can’t do that I don’t want to do that” and I just felt so ashamed/regretful that I said that I had a nephew instead of saying I had a child. I knew that they would see me differently and not see me for me and I never would have had any chance at a speck of a relationship with C. So I lied to have a relationship. 

I wanted to tell her every second of every day and it just kept getting buried further and further, I dug myself into a hole and the “DINKWAD(C)” (double income, no kids, with a dog/cat” comments kept coming and I felt further ashamed and disappointed that the life I have led up til now can never be able to relate or match with their lifestyle. 

Eventually C found out and confronted me, I couldn’t confess it to her so she had to tell me she knew and from there it was over. She said I was a nice person but there’s no way we could ever work out anymore and that we could still be friends to some degree but our relationship is over. 

I told her that I could not be okay with just being friends and we both agreed that meant farewell.

This happened tonight and I removed her and the friend group from everything, permanently deleted my discord/other accounts and am now friendless, alone and distraught. 

I know I am the asshole and I can’t imagine how much pain I’ve put her through and I feel so disgusted with myself I just wanted to be seen for me and not for the choices of my past and the constant fuckups I’ll always make in my life.

I live with many regrets in my life and will continue to carry those burdens but I will never regret loving C with everything I could, I swear to you I will always love you. Go achieve your dinkwad/c and be successful in life because you deserve nothing less than perfect. 

Obligatory, so Reddit, am I the AH?


Sorry for the venting post and I wish you all a good night. If C ever sees this, know I never meant to hurt you and wish you the best always. ",1,1745824482.0,AITAH,4,0.6,False

I've been making my own syrups for coffee lately, just boiling water and adding sweetener plus some salt as a base, to flavor it I'd use extracts or infuse lavender buds for instance (of course I refrigerate the syrup to keep it safe and fresh, as much as I can at least)

Anyway, I've been thinking of infusing cinnamon sticks into it. I know that in and of itself isn't a new thing, lots of recipes do it. But I'd probably use a lot of cinnamon sticks considering that I love spice flavors, and it's supposed to be a concentrated syrup 

What'd be the ""safe limit"" of infused cinnamon, if that can even be quantified? Ground nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon all have levels considered safe (cinnamon probably being less dangerous than the others), or is it just when ingesting the solids that aren't infused that'd be a problem?",0,1745824465.0,foodsafety,2,0.33,False

1k9pl3j,https://i.redd.it/p4hiswn70jxe1.jpeg,Al Maham Fragrances,"Good afternoon Frag family. This is my 14th review, and it is on Al Maham Fragrances. I had ordered 17 frags from them of 10 ml each. Their prices are on the higher side. Almost all their frags seemed to be well blended. If you go for higher volume, they will be relatively cheaper. It came in a test tube type of thin and long vials. I am trying them after 4 months of receiving them. Below is my honest opinion for each of the frag. Please go through it and let me know if you like it or if I can improve on something.

1. Ms Congeniality        

Inspired/Clone of: Delina Exclusif by Parfums de Marly.            

Impression: Bright fruity opening with a hint of bergamot, lychee, and fresh and tarty sour berries. Smells like a fruit tart. It has a floral heart with pleasant smelling rose & lilies. Dry down has some hint of rose along with some vanilla, musk which makes it smell amazing. This is mostly a female oriented frag and can be worn on casual occasions. It has very good longevity and projection. Easily lasts for 5~6 hrs. 

Rating: 8.5

2. The Matrix    

Inspired/Clone of: Nio by Xerjoff            

Impression: Fresh and uplifting opening. If you cut fresh grass and squeeze some lemon in it, that kind of smell I get. Post that I was able to detect some cardamom along with a subtle hint of jasmine. In the dry down the grassy vibe is still detectable along with some woody characteristics. Overall, I found it very fresh for hot summers. Stays on an average of 4~5 hrs and projects well.         

Rating: 8

3. The Magic of Hibiscus            

Inspired/Clone of: Hibiscus Mahajád by Maison Crivelli            

Impression: Floral bomb! Luxurious! Opens with the fresh smell of hibiscus along with the cooling vibe of mint note and a hint of tanginess. Initial projection is mind blowing, room filler! This nicely projects for about 30 mins and that is when the rose comes to the act, which is more like a wet rose. Dry down is a bit sweet and musky with some amount of the floral explosion still present. Lasts easily for about 5 hours and still traces are present as a skin scent. Even longer on garments.  

Rating: 9

4. Chess Blocking         

Inspired/Clone of: Mind Games by Blockade   

Impression: One of the best fresh openings to me. On a hot sunny day, you open a bottle of fizzy lemon soda which has a lot of semi ripe mangoes in it. That sharp mix of raw mango along with the citrus is super refreshing and you can also feel the cooling note of mint which is present in the background. This projects like a beast for about 30 mins. The heart continues with that sweet fruity vibe along with some added floral notes. The dry down is very sophisticated and a bit mellowed down. It is mostly woody and musky. The overall longevity is close to 4 hrs and stays longer on garments. May get nose blind if you spray a lot.             

Rating: 9

5. The Morning Coffee 

Inspired/Clone of: Awake by Akro          

Impression: Interesting take on coffee. I have seen this happen to tea but coffee never. I always enjoy a brew of plain black coffee. This opens with a distinct coffee note with added nuttiness but wait it has lemon and cardamom in it which is very unique and somehow rounds the strong coffee flavour. The initial blast stays for about 15~20 mins after which you will smell like a cardamom coffee with mostly hazelnut, making it creamier. In the end you will be experiencing the coffee notes with some amount of sweetness and smokiness. Longevity is decent for about 5 hrs. It stays for more than 12 hrs on clothes.            

Rating: 8.5

6. The White Milk           

Inspired/Clone of: Bianco Latte by Giardini Di Toscana              

Impression: Sweet, Vanilla, milky and caramel, just like the smell you get of vanilla milkshake with caramel on top. Also smells a bit like condensed milk, extremely sweet. The same vibe remains throughout and at the end you get a musky vanilla. The sweetness can be a little cloying for someone who is not so used to this. The projection and longevity are decent, and it easily lasts for about 4~5 hrs. I tried layering this with the above frag and it turned out to be a caramel latte with cardamom in it. Was pretty interesting imo.      

Rating: 8

7. The Sovereign            

Inspired/Clone of: Oligarch by Roja      

Impression: Sharp opening with citruses along with green and herbal notes. This projects very nicely for about 20 mins. Then there is a fusion of tropical fruits and florals which is quite interesting. Tanginess along with the pleasant notes of jasmine, champa added to the creaminess of coconut. Dry down is mossy, woody, a bit spicy, musky along with some a hint of sweetness. Overall, it lasts long enough to leave an impression. Stays longer on clothes.              

Rating: 8.5

8. Leather for Ages        

Inspired/Clone of: Ombre Nomade by Louis Vuitton    

Impression: The moment you spray you are greeted with the powerful oud which is trying to unleash the raw power it possess but it is humbled by the presence of rose and raspberry, which makes it a bit sweeter and controls the barnyard characteristics of the untamed oud. There is a smokiness to it due to the incense notes as well. It seems like the oud is put on a leash by the fruity and floral elements and the harmony is very joyful. The dry down continues to be warm with the smoky leathery oud. It is a delight for oud lovers and is definitely a winter/evening frag. It is very subjective as all will not appreciate this. I personally like it and the longevity along with the projection is decent. It lasts 5~6 hrs with a little more on clothes.      

Rating: 8.5

9. Chill by the Pacific   

Inspired/Clone of: Pacific Chill by Louis Vuitton             

Impression: Very nice fruity and tropical fragrance. Apt for summer and if you are out in the sun near a beach, this frag will relate to that environment. Opens with a burst of citrus, to an extent where it smells like a bitter citrusy aromatic note, like the crushed leaves of a lemon tree. Very uplifting and zesty which lasts for close to 30 mins. At the heart it is a little herbal and green due to the basil and mint. Dry down is mostly woody and musky which balances the bright behaviour of the frag. The overall experience lasts for about 4~5 hrs.        

Rating: 8.5

10. The Fortune              

Inspired/Clone of: Naxos by Xerjoff      

Impression: Opens with a dense sweet honey along with citrusy notes and lavender. Opening can become cloying to someone if over sprayed but if used in moderation, it smells good. I over sprayed before getting into an elevator and noticed a lady feeling uncomfortable. After 10 mins or so you start getting the cinnamon along with it. Exactly like cinnamon honey if you have smelt it. Soon you feel the pleasant smell of jasmine mixed with it giving it the floral edge. Towards the dry down there is a creamy vanilla added to it and a hint of tobacco. It smells the best in the dry down to me. Overall, the experience is nice, and it projects & lasts well.            

Rating: 9

11. The Candylicious   

Inspired/Clone of: Candy Aoud by Roja              

Impression: Very weird opening I must say. It has a very ripe banana peel note along with earthy, woody, mossy notes. I expected it to be sweeter as the name suggests but it was not. I did not get oud as well. It continues to stay mossy mostly with an earthy and woody vibe. Frankly, I did not pick any more notes. Not sure if it is my nose which failed me or the perfume is like this, because I am confused with the name. I did not like this perfume at all. Longevity was also below average.

Rating: 4

12. Gold Oudh 

Inspired/Clone of: Amber Aoud by Roja             

Impression: Opens with almost negligible citrusy elements and the star of the show i.e., rose which is a little powdery kind. It projects beautifully for the opening 15 mins. After that, the rose stays, and it is accompanied by a sweet fig note. The oud here also starts evolving but that is not so dense or powerful, rather smoothened by the rose. The rose here is very elegant, like you will get transported to the Mughal era. At the end, the rose is present but not so dominant, oud is there which is not the barnyard types, there is some woody feel, and I can detect oakmoss with a bit of musk. Overall, it is most definitely not an everyday wear. This can be worn preferably in evenings for marriages or if you are attending some event like a ghazal nite. It has very good projection and longevity. Lasts for 5~6 hrs.      

Rating: 8.5

13. Wulong Tea

Inspired/Clone of: Wulong Cha by Nishane     

Impression: Iced lemon tea. Refreshing, uplifting, and calming! As soon as you spray you get the freshness of citrus, little green and hint of spice and the tea note. This will immediately transport you to a café in hot summer, sipping a nice blend of iced lemon tea without sugar. This stays around for most of the journey, until you get some musk. This will also remind you of a high-end spa with the calming music in the background. Overall, the longevity and projection are average.  

Rating: 8

14. The Ocean

Inspired/Clone of: Oceania by Roja      

Impression: A bright citrusy opening which will uplift your senses with bergamot, orange, and lemon. The opening notes also have a little bit of green herbal notes. The opening smells very close to Limoncello, an Italian drink. This projects beautifully for the first 15-20 mins. The heart comprises of a bouquet of fresh flowers from which the major note I can detect is of jasmine. It also has a powdery floral kind of smell. It dries down with a musky, woody and mossy vibe. All said, I am not sure if I got any aquatic notes or sea notes. I may be wrong, but the name could be because of the overall feel you get by a beachside. It is more like you are visiting a beach resort and when you arrive you are welcomed with Limoncello and a garland of flowers. The longevity however is not as great as I expected. It stays close to 3hrs after which it becomes a skin scent. You will need to reapply for it to last more.               

Rating: 7.5

15. Strength Wind         

Inspired/Clone of: Hanuman by Boadicea the Victorious          

Impression: Bright juicy citrusy blast opening with some added sweet tart coming from blackcurrant. It stays for about 20 mins after which the floral notes bloom consisting of neroli and jasmine. This makes the whole experience softer from the bright opening it had. Dries down to a creamy sandalwood base with some musky and vanilla notes in the background. Overall, it is a good profile, and the longevity is decent i.e., for about 4~5 hrs.               

Rating: 8.5

16. The Poseidons Imagine Cologne    

Inspired/Clone of: Aventus Cologne by Creed + Imagination by Louis Vuitton

Impression: Very refreshingly bright citrusy opening with the orange peel, lemon, and more lime. It also has some amount of mint and a tiny bit of spiciness. Very likeable opening and it stays for the first 20 mins. Transitions to a bit greener and woodier side making it aromatic and earthy with some freshness still present. Dry down is smoky, musky, and woody. This is very well suited for hot summers. It is not a beast in terms of projection, but decent enough for you to keep getting those beautiful whiffs in between. Lasts for 4~5 hrs.   

Rating: 8.5

17. Hacivat X   

Inspired/Clone of: Hacivat X by Nishane           

Impression: Juicy pineapple with bergamot and a hint of spice contributes to the lively opening. After the initial burst the florals come to focus with the citrus in the background. In the dry down it has a pronounced woody note along with some earthy vibes. Very masculine imo and has the tendency to make one go nose blind. It lasts close to ~4 hrs after which it becomes a skin scent.

Rating: 8.5

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! 🌟

You ever have one of those days where your brain feels like it's been wrapped in cotton wool? One minute you're ready to tackle the world, and the next you're staring blankly at your to-do list like it’s written in a foreign language. Yeah, me too. 

Mental fog can be a real buzzkill, right? It hits us when we least expect it, sometimes even when we’ve had our coffee! ☕ But guess what? I found this little daily ritual that takes just **three minutes** and honestly makes a world of difference. Let’s break it down!

### The 3-Minute Ritual to Clear the Fog:

1. **Breathe Like You Mean It** 🌬️
   - Find a comfy spot, sit down, and close your eyes. 
   - Take a deep breath in for **4 seconds**, hold for **4**, and release for **6**. 
   - Repeat this **3 times**. You’ll be shocked at how quickly your mind starts to clear. 

2. **Gratitude Drop** 🙏
   - Think of **one thing** you’re grateful for today. 
   - It could be anything — your favorite mug, a friend’s text, or that *surprisingly* great sandwich you had for lunch. 
   - Seriously, this shifts your focus from “What’s wrong?” to “What’s right?” and it’s magic. 

3. **Set an Intention** 🎯
   - Decide on one small goal for the day. 
   - It could be as simple as ""I’ll read for 10 minutes"" or ""I’ll declutter my desk."" 
   - Trust me, this gives you a purpose and makes those upcoming tasks feel way less daunting. 

### Why It Works:

- **Mindfulness**: Those few moments of deep breathing ground you, anchoring you back to the present. 
- **Positivity**: Shifting your mindset from negativity (hello, mental fog!) to gratitude is like flipping on a light switch in your brain.
- **Focus**: Setting an intention gives your day direction, making it feel more manageable. 

So, who’s ready to try this out? 🤗 I mean, it’s literally three minutes—less time than it takes to scroll through TikTok! And honestly, doesn't it sound way more beneficial? 

If you’ve got your own tricks for tackling the dreaded mental fog, drop them below; I’d love to hear what works for you! Let’s keep the conversation going and help each other out. 🌈

Unfortunately, It doesn't work like that.

Finding a real technical co-founder is brutally hard, because you’re not just looking for someone who can code. That's the bare minimum. You're looking for someone who:

●       Is genuinely proficient in tech (obviously).

●       Is willing to learn about business (otherwise, they’re a tech lead, not a CTO).

●       Can handle serious stress without falling apart (because startups are like a constant slow-motion trainwreck and you can’t have someone who crumbles).

●       Matches you in terms of personality (trust me, otherwise small disagreements become catastrophic over time).

●       Cares deeply about the actual problem you’re solving (not just looking for an equity lottery ticket).

What nobody talks about: Most co-founder apps or platforms can match you on skills or interests  but they can’t test how much pressure a person can handle. And that's the thing that will absolutely make or break your partnership when shit hits the fan (and it will).

How we found our tech co-founder: We hired him first.

Yeah, literally. We hired someone, and over time we saw how he worked and the way he was learning backend and frontend stuff so aggressively (honestly it was a little scary in a good way), the way he started understanding business side decisions, the way he stayed calm when everything was chaos. That's when we knew: this guy is the real deal.

Bottom line: You don't truly know someone until you’ve worked with them. Period.  
Not coffee chats, not vibe checks, not LinkedIn DMs. Work. Together. See how they operate under real startup stress. See how they adapt when things go wrong. Then and only then should you even start thinking about giving away co-founder equity.

You can store arrays with no statically known size on the heap, which includes large and small arrays without problem. But why does the language provide all this machinery for the rare case of `dynamic size && small size && stack storage`? It makes the language complex, it invites risk of stack overflows, and it limits the lifetime of the array as now it will be deallocated on function return - more dangling pointers to the gods of dangling pointers! Every use of VLAs can be replaced with dynamic array allocation or, if you're programming a coffee machine and cannot have `malloc`, with a big constant-size array allocation.

1k9phfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1k9phfy/evaluate_the_viability_of_this_theory_and/,Evaluate the viability of this theory and practice. Note this was originally a comment replying to another post.,"Theory:

If you are alive then you have a brain. When alive and awake at best our brains project an accurate ""simulation"" of portions of an external physical world according to the limitations of the receptivity of our sensory organs.

Interpreting experiencing physical reality as accurately ""hallucinating"" physical reality because neural activity of the sensory systems results in this sensory world; then it stands to reason that if spirit realms exist then one has to ""hallucinate"" them accurately as opposed to inaccurately.

Practice:

Since the brain is geared to ""hallucinate"" the limited receptivity of our sensory organs while awake I'd recommend sensory deprivation as a means to tune one's brain to hallucinate the spirit realms accurately. Also drink a coffee before sensory deprivation as sensory deprivation can induce sleepiness.

Note 1: Also believe nothing, analyze and evaluate everything. Spirits can lie just like the living.

Note 2: You'll notice that when looking at bright visible lights there is an after effect that remains. What you're aiming for is the opposite of being snowblind when using sensory deprivation.

Note 3: There's sense data purely because of the mind, sense data that reflects a physical world which the brain is geared towards, and then sense data that reflects the spirit realms.

Note 4: Use symbols to protect your sanity. There is a psychological dimension to everything when you have a conscious mind. Even what we experience through life is the brain's symbolism of an external physical world.

I told him that it's not okay, and I want at least for him to share a lot more about their relationship and I want to meet her. He said no, and I said we are breaking up. He didn't fight for us at all, brought up long distance that we would have to go through in a few months and that he thinks it's impossible. Admitted it was emotional cheating.

And I don't know how can I move on. I am thinking that he is definitely an asshole, that he manipulated me throughout this relationship. But I still love him.

Mondays... We've All Been There! 😴  
Ah, Monday. That familiar feeling of the weekend slipping away and the weight of the week looming. We get it! It's okay to feel a little draggy after a good weekend.  
But here's the thing: you've got this! 💪 You just spent a couple of days doing things you love, recharging your batteries, and filling your cup. Tap into that positive energy!

\* Reward yourself: Plan a small reward for getting through the day. It could be anything from a cup of coffee to a few minutes of meditation.  
\* Remember your weekend wins: Take a moment to reflect on the positive experiences you had over the weekend. Let those good vibes fuel your Monday.

SOUND of morning news on TV, coffee maker humming, general low-level chaos

The Torres kitchen is stylishly modern but lived-in. There are high-end appliances mixed with school papers and sports equipment. SIMONE TORRES (34, Black/Latina, sharp blazer over sweatpants, carrying a medical bag and a coffee mug) is barking orders while simultaneously trying to find her car keys. JAMES TORRES (36, Black, wearing tailored jeans and a cool vintage band tee, already has a sneaker box by the door) is scrolling through his phone, a half-eaten piece of toast in his mouth, occasionally nodding.

RAKAI TORRES (16, Black/Latino, dreads pulled back, grabbing a granola bar, looking noncommittal) is leaning against the counter. AALIYAH TORRES (15, Black/Latina, thick curly hair perfectly styled, full face of makeup, lashes, brows, and nails done, holding a cheerleading uniform) is rummaging through the junk drawer.

SIMONE> Rakai! Did you get your ass check the football gear last night? Practice uniforms gotta be in the wash! 

RAKAI> Yeah, Ma. Did it.

SIMONE> 'Yeah, Ma. Did it.' You sound like a damn broken record. You get that C taken care of in World History or you still out here playing games?

RAKAI> Ms. Evans said she'd look at the extra credit today. I'm on it.

JAMES>> (Looking up from phone, smirking) > Leave the boy alone, Simone. He got good grades overall. You the one who said C's get degrees... well, B's is even better.

SIMONE> That was \*my\* philosophy back then, not theirs! Besides, I graduated Summa Cum Laude, James. What the hell you talking about? And don't you act like you ain't the one on his ass about eligibility every damn season.

JAMES> Hey, eligibility is different! That's the lawyer in me. Grades for just... grades? That's \*your\* department. You make sure they ain't dumb, I make sure they can play ball and get scholarships. Teamwork, baby.

AALIYAH>> (Slamming the drawer shut in frustration) > Ugh! Where the hell are my white laces?! Coach says if our shoes aren't regulation white today, we're running suicides!

SIMONE> Aaliyah! Language! And check your cheer bag! How many times we gotta tell you?! Organization! It's the key to not losing your damn mind!

AALIYAH> I \*am\* organized! Except for things that mysteriously disappear! It's probably Rakai!

RAKAI> Ni&&a. Why would I touch your crusty ass shoe laces?

AALIYAH> They're not crusty! My shoes are pristine! Unlike someone's cleats that smell like... like the dumpster behind the fish market!

JAMES>> (Chuckles, stands up, stretches) > Alright, alright. Nobody's cleats smell \*that\* bad. Rakai,son  you ready? Got that history paper tucked away?

RAKAI> Yeah, Pops. Got it

.JAMES> Good. Remember what I told you. If you got five minutes before class... maybe sneak in a quick one outside the back fence. Clear the head.

Simone fixes James with a death glare.

SIMONE> James! What the hell did we say?! You cant  be offering the boy a joint right before school! That's an \*after\* school thing!

JAMES> Hey! He's sixteen! It's a stressful world! Just saying, work smarter, not harder. A quick puff calms the nerves before a big test.

RAKAI>> (Shrugs) > Nah, I'm good, Pops. Got practice right after school anyway. Don't need that in my lungs before drills.

SIMONE>> (Exasperated but also slightly relieved) > Thank you, Rakai. See, James? Responsible. Unlike his father.

JAMES> Hey! I'm responsible! I'm just... realistic! Life ain't always clean, Simone. Sometimes you gotta embrace the dirt... and the THC

Aaliyah finds her laces tucked inside her cheer backpack.

AALIYAH> Found 'em! Ugh, thank God. I didn't spend an hour on this beat and these curls for nothing. Imagine running suicides with a full face! The melt would be tragic

.SIMONE> Your face is the least of my worries if you ain't got the right uniform, Aaliyah. Grades good? Chores done?

AALIYAH> Yes, Ma! Everything's logged in the app! I even cleaned the upstairs bathroom sink!

SIMONE> That's right! Now grab a damn piece of fruit or something that ain't processed sugar before you leave! And lock the door behind you! You too, Rakai! If y'all pockets empty after school, don't come crying to me! Y'all got jobs!

RAKAI> Got it.

AALIYAH> Okay, Ma! Love you! Bye, Dad!

Aaliyah grabs a banana and her bag, heading for the door with Rakai close behind, pulling on his backpack.

JAMES> Later, kids! Stay outta trouble! Unless it's profitable trouble!

SIMONE>> (Putting her hands on her hips, glaring at James) > 'Profitable trouble'? What kind of advice is that?! Lawyer talk.

JAMES> Hey! They got to understand the hustle! It's compton, baby. They got that in they  bloodline. They'll figure it out.

SIMONE>> (Sighs, but a small smile plays on her lips) > Just make sure they figure it out \*after\* they get their degrees. And their chores are done.

Simone finally finds her keys on the counter, right where they were.

SIMONE> Damn it...

JAMES> Told you they were there. You always lose focus in the morning chaos.

SIMONE> It ain't chaos, it's \*life\* in this damn house! Now you ready? We both got court today. You got that fresh pair on or you still rocking the beaters?

James gestures to the sneaker box by the door, a grin spreading across his face.

JAMES> Please. It's Monday. Gotta start the week right. These the new Jordans they been talking 'bout. Gonna turn heads at the courthouse.

SIMONE>> (Shakes her head, grabs her bag, adjusts her blazer) > Of course they are. Alright, let's roll. And don't be cursing out the valet again.

JAMES> No promises, babe. Depends on their service.

They head towards the door, Simone still slightly frazzled, James cool and collected, ready to take on the courthouse in style. The house is momentarily quiet, leaving the faint scent of coffee and maybe a hint of very expensive cologne.

Hey, been feeling a bit lonely lately and stressed with school so it’d be dope if I could connect with  some people! HMU if u wanna chat about whatever ! I’m a really nonjudgmental person and can talk about literally anything. I love memes (LMAO), going to explore coffee shops nearby, art, music, and sports. I also love to make my own music and have been playing guitar since I was 12. I’m in school for biochemistry and I’m in my last semester. I’d write more here but it’d be cool if we could connect and talk about our interests. I’m cool with discord or whatever platform. If you could include your fav food in the chat, that’d be great. Hope to meet yall!!",3,1745823235.0,r4r,1,0.67,False
1k9papb,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1k9papb/please_rate_or_comment_this_itspecific_short/,"Please rate or comment this IT-specific short story ""Day Seven""","This story took place in what lower-order realities call the Metaverse—or more precisely, in one of its infinite office spaces, where time flowed in sprints and gods worked in Agile.

A novice Developer-Creator sat before his quantum terminal, coding a new universe under the working title *Project Universe 2.0*. Deadlines loomed, and management was displeased.

He had botched the first simulation iteration by ignoring the fundamental rule of all Creators: *to make intelligent life in their own image*. Instead, he had populated a promising solar system with aglonal cyclopods—crustacean-like beings that, to his delight, evolved over millions of years.

But in their civilization’s final act, using the gravitational fields of a supermassive black hole, they rearranged the Milky Way’s stars into an obscene depiction of their own reproductive organs.

Who was this cosmic middle finger meant for? Other intelligent species? He hadn’t coded any yet. The Creator himself? Then why? Had he gone too far by making post-coital cannibalism mandatory? Or was it the plagues—necessary for early evolutionary drive but clearly overkill in hindsight?

Worse, the cyclopods’ gravitational meddling triggered a quantum collapse of Sagittarius A\*. Normally, no big deal—galaxies are expendable. But in his first draft, to save processing power, the Developer had made all black holes share a single singularity. One collapse meant *total system failure*. Poof—all data vanished into /dev/null.

Only a screenshot remained in his *Images* folder: the Milky Way’s lewd asterism. Definitely not for management’s eyes. (Maybe the team chat, though.)

""This time, it’ll be perfect,"" he vowed, rewriting the code:

Dark matter—a filesystem expanding true vacuum into false.

Dark energy—the background process controlling expansion speed.

Elementary particles—data packets.

Black holes—Information processors enforcing gravitational stability—*now with individual singularities!*

But legacy code fought back: infinite density paradoxes, causality violations, galactic-scale glitches. Relativity and quantum mechanics refused to reconcile.

""Fine. Some variables stay non-deterministic. At least the universe won’t crash again.""

Stars remained multi-purpose objects—habitable zone generators, potential black hole seeds—while he tweaked their distribution: *""Giant stars make great galactic landmarks.""*

Now, for intelligent life. Not another cyclopod disaster. He quietly forked a senior dev’s *""Image & Likeness""* module, blending it with his crustacean legacy—minus the mate-eating (mostly). Fewer deadly diseases, but not *too* few—civilizations needed struggle to avoid stagnation. He dialed up aggression, hoping they’d see WMDs as deterrents, not first options to use in any conflict.

After seven *""Hard Mondays""* (the Metaverse’s sneaky way to cram extra workdays on one week) and 21 coffees, *Universe 2.0* compiled flawlessly.

Initialization logs:

Big Bang—ОК.

Inflation—ОК.

Cosmic Dawn—ОК.

...Humanity?

At 13.8 billion years, the simulation stalled. Humans terraformed Mars—then science *stopped*. His singularity fixes had backfired: physics anomalies birthed speculative theories, not warp drives. The universe hit a bug deeper than any black hole.

""13.8 billion years… worse than last time."" Management would rage. A ground-up rewrite was needed.

""Seven Mondays can’t craft perfection! Those ‘legendary one-sprint creations’? Just the IT director’s motivational lies!""

With a sigh, he entered the command. The universe dissolved into pure vacuum.",1,1745823142.0,writers,2,1.0,False
1k9p95f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9p95f,REVIEW: 8 Doors Distillery New Make,"I visited 8 Doors Distillery a few days ago. The Northernmost Whisky distillery on the UK mainland. 

A beautiful location and comfortable visitor lounge. Their staff was great and very welcoming. (My wife was happy that their cafe had cake and coffee too.) 😉

Since they are only a few years old and they have yet to release their first whisky, they offer a nice selection of their independent bottlings, a single malt, single grain and a few blends. (More on those in another post.)

I was particularly interested in tasting their New Make. And it was delicious!  A good indicator of the direction the direction their single malt is headed. 

🥃
Nose: Sweet, overripe light fruit, damp hay. 
Palate: Sweet, sugary, malty grain. 
Finish: Short dry, light sweetness.

I’m really looking forward to their first release! 🥃👍🏼",3,1745822951.0,Scotch,1,0.81,False

We are 21M and 23F and we met on bumble. We scheduled to meet 3pm, I arrive at 2:52 and she’s already there and we greet and start walking to a coffee shop she picked. On the way there she tells me that she has never been on a date before and that she’s really anxious. I tell her that I too just started dating (this is was my 7th date ever).

So we sit and order etc, and we talk and we have a lot of common interests (movies, series music etc), and at some point she pulls out her phone and she had made a long list of questions to ask to have stuff to talk about, I found that very cute and the questions were pretty fun and interesting, and in general we had really fun conversations and laughed a lot, even when there were a couple awkward pauses we just laughed.

At some point though, a friend calls her and she mutes the phone and she picked it up like 30-40 minutes later to text and told me she will be going to find some of her friends that are going to another coffee shop nearby. So after about 20 minutes we get going. 

The date was a bit over 2 hours, I’m just worried because maybe she had that as an exit strategy and she wanted to just leave, even though the vibes were good. I’m pretty inexperienced so I don’t know how to read that situation.

At the end of the date, she goes for a hug first and we say goodbye and she said it twice for some reason haha.

Then later I text her and we have the following conversation (translated from another language):

Me: I really had fun today :))

Me: Do you want to do something again this week?

(She replies 1hr later when usually she replies almost instantly)

Her: Me too, I’m just a bit sick so I don’t know when I will be able to (I did a test, it wasn’t Covid or flu)

Me: oh okay I hope you get well soon
 
Me: whenever you feel better feel free to text me to make plans if you want

Me: however if you don’t want to you can just tell me it’s alright

Her: thank you so much \^\^ I will text you when I feel a bit better 

Me: alright talk to you then

Her: alright \^~\^

-

Note: she actually did say at some point on the date that her throat was a bit sore

So I don’t know how to read the situation on if she actually wants to do a second date or if she is just making excuses because she is not interested. I just don’t want to wait a week or two to figure it out if she just ghosts me.

My friends told me to text her in a few days how she’s feeling and to recommend a date on the next weekend if she is feeling good then. However I feel like that is a bit pushy and since she hasn’t dated before it might be a bit overwhelming to ask for a date again.

Sorry for the long post, I just really clicked with her, much more than my other dates, and I love her personality and and she’s really cute, and don’t want to ruin this. I just want some advice on how to move forward and on how to read the whole situation on if she’s interested or not because it’s causing me a lot of anxiety lol.

I have been using for about 6 months my rather typical sage combo (Bambino + smart grinder pro) and i have been very happy with the results. But since i like to tinker with my equipment i thought that after purchasing a bottomless portafilter and a wdt tool , i could upgrade my machine with an ims shower screen and an ims basket. So i bought the ims BV200NT which works fine, but the issue is the basket and since i think the best way to explain it by a video i am uploading one that showcases the issue.

This video comes from an 18.1 gram dose, grind setting on my grinder at 3 (though my inner burr is set at 4) , and good puck prep.  
i have tried underdosing (16 grams) and overdosing 20 gramms, i have tried other grind settings from 7 to 3 and i get the same result which indicated lots of channeling.

When i switch back to the oem basket everything works as expected (with the ims shower screen) so its not a shower screen problem.

Any help would be much appreciated  
PS i know i can just use my old oem basket and call it a day :P

Hey MaximizeMe fam! 🙌 Let's talk about that dreaded *afternoon slump*. You know the one—your energy tanks, motivation nosedives, and suddenly, even scrolling through memes feels like a chore. 😴 Been there, right?

So, here’s my story: I was in *desperate* need of a reboot. My afternoons were a blur of yawns and caffeine crashes. Seriously, how many cups of coffee is too many? 🤔

And then, I stumbled across something intriguing: **Cold Exposure + Box Breathing for cortisol control**. It sounded like a one-way ticket to frostbite and hyperventilation, but hey, desperate times!

Fast forward 7 days, here’s what happened:

- **Day 1:** *Cold showers are Satan’s domain.* I hesitated at the tap like it was a horror movie scene. But, a few gasps later, I was awake in a way no latte could rival. 💧

- **Day 3:** Introducing *Box Breathing*: 4 seconds in, 4 seconds hold, 4 seconds out, 4 seconds hold. It felt like a nifty little mental hack, like a meeting with my breath instead of my boss. 

- **Mid-week revelation:** My tendency to zombify at 3 PM was actually shrinking. Yup, fewer droopy eyelids and more ""Okay, what’s next?"" energy. 🏃‍♂️💨

- **Magic or science?** Let’s call it a bit of both. The cold apparently helps regulate cortisol. Who knew a bracing shower could tame stress hormones? And that breathing? It’s like hitting ‘reset’ on my brain in under a minute. 🚀

I won't lie, friends—a cold shower will probs never feel like a cozy blanket. But it sure gives me a zing of energy that’s hard to ignore. And Box Breathing? Now it's my go-to for staying centered when life gets a tad too chaotic.
