Advice for the Bar Examinee (2016 ed.)
by: PROF. MANUEL R. RIGUERA

“The key is not the will to win.  Everybody has that.  It is the will to prepare to win that is important.” — Bobby Knight, Hall of Fame Basketball Coach.

I have put together some advice and tips for those about to sit for the bar examination.  These are based on my two decades’ experience as a law professor, bar review lecturer, and bar exam coach.   I hope that they will prove of some help to the examinee who aspires to hurdle one of the toughest bar examinations in the planet.     

BEFORE THE BAR EXAM

READ MATERIALS ON HOW TO PREPARE FOR AND PASS THE BAR EXAM.   The bar exam is not a matter to take lightly.  Hence reading materials on how to prepare for and to pass the bar will greatly increase your chances of seeing your name inscribed in the bar exam hall of fame.  You can bring these materials as light reading to your three-day vacation after law school graduation.    When I prepared for the 1991 bar, I read a well-worn pamphlet by Prof. Jose Nolledo, Pointers for a Bar Candidate (1960).  I also read a booklet by Commissioner Regalado Maambong on the bar examination.   The two booklets served me well by giving practical advice on how to prepare for the bar and how to avoid costly mistakes during the preparation and the actual taking of the bar.  

From the current crop of bar prep books, I strongly recommend Bar Blues (Central Books, 2013)written by Tanya Karina Lat, Maria Gracia Gamez, and Marilyn Manait.  Bar Blues is comprehensive yet very readable.  Slaying the Bar Exam Dragon by Dean Rufus Rodriguez is another book which I would advise you to read.  

PREPARE AND ORGANIZE YOUR REVIEW MATERIALS.  Prepare your list of reviewers after your graduation and buy those that you do not have.  Get the opinion of professors and last year’s bar examinees as they are the best judges of law reviewers and can give you the pros and cons of a particular reviewer. 

As for the copious annotations or commentaries that you used as textbooks during your first three years in law school, consult them only if you need examples or illustrations of particular legal provisions.  This is an area where annotations or commentaries have an advantage over most reviewers which tend to put too much emphasis on rules without giving the underlying fact pattern for such rule.  

In this regard, I strongly advise the use of reviewers which are in Q&A form or which give examples or illustrations of the rules.   This reviewers will serve the dual purpose of being a review material as well as a training material for answering the bar which is substantially made up of problem-type or fact-based questions. 

PREPARE A BAR REVIEW SCHEDULE.  A bar-review schedule is your road-map to navigating the six months of bar review.  If you are enrolled in a bar review center, synchronize your schedule with that of the bar review center.  Otherwise you will not be reviewing effectively.  It’s not advisable to listen to the lecturer discuss negotiable instruments and then go home and read up on labor relations.  In this regard, choose a bar review center wherein there is a topical unity and continuity in the schedule, that is, where one particular bar exam subject is discussed at a time before proceeding to another bar exam subject.  Avoid bar review centers with a hodgepodge schedule where for example, negotiable instruments is discussed on one day, then labor relations on the next, and then civil procedure on the day after. 

My advice is that you study one bar exam subject before going to another.  Some advise reviewing one subject in the first half of the day (say remedial law) and then another (say commercial law) in the second half of the day.  The avowed purpose is to avoid ennui.  I think this sacrifices focus and effectiveness just to add variety.   One must simply have the self-discipline and drive to study one bar subject at a time.

If you are not attending or viewing bar review lectures, you have to prepare your own detailed schedule.   A rule of thumb in dividing your study time is to multiply the number of days available for review with the weight given to a particular bar examination subject.  Let us say that you have 156 days allocated for your review (May to October, excluding Sundays).  Political law has a weight of 15%.   156 days multiplied by 15% will give you 23 days.   So you allocate 23 days more or less for political law. 

In your review schedule, the last bar subjects that you should study should be labor law and then political law (the so-called “mirror schedule).  This will enhance the effectiveness of your review since political law and labor law are the bar exam subjects you will tackle on the first Sunday.     

You should also prepare a daily study schedule.   The latter is a detailed daily planner of your wake-up time, meals, breaks, and your “lights out” which you should follow strictly in order to get into the groove of rigorous studying.  

I recommend that your wake-up time should be at 4:30 a.m. and “lights out” should be at 9 p.m.     This is to make your body clock adjust to this schedule so that by November, you would be used to sleeping and waking up early.

After you have drawn up your schedule, stick to it at all costs!  If you see that you are running behind schedule, pick up your pace.   This is the reason why you should select and prune your reading materials.  Many reviewees make the mistake of being overly ambitious in their study load with the result that they fall behind schedule.   Study smart!  The point is that you are not studying to be a legal authority but to pass the bar.  The bar reviewers (with rare exceptions) will not quiz you on arcane areas of the law.  Leave the scholarly stuff for later after you have passed the bar and have decided to write a law journal article.      

ENROLL IN A BARREVIEWCENTER.  There are advantages and disadvantages to enrolling in a bar review center.   Among the perceived disadvantages are the increased costs, which include the enrollment fee, the transportation and food costs, and accommodation costs for those who reside in the provinces.   Also quite some time is spent in preparing and dressing up and in going to and from the bar review center. 

Despite these considerations, I strongly recommend that a bar examinee enroll in a bar review center.   A law graduate does not have the degree of knowledge of the bar subject and the intuitive feel for what are the important topics and probable bar exam questions which an experienced bar review lecturer has.   Also a bar review center provides case and statutory updates, which because of time limitations, is often not provided by law schools. 

Take note that law and jurisprudence is in a constant state of flux and what you thought may have been good law last year or even last month may no longer be so.   Recent developments affect the law as a whole and not just specific or isolated provisions.  Hence these should not be taught or learned in a truncated or isolated manner but should be imparted to the reviewee in a holistic manner, that is, seamlessly woven into a bar review subject as an integral element thereof.    Only a seasoned bar lecturer, with his experience and intuitive feel of the law, is capable of performing this challenging feat.    A bar reviewee who relies on past review material and simply tries to incorporate “updates” into his study is playing with fire.          

A recent innovation is online bar review.  The bar reviewee need not go to a “brick-and-mortar” bar review center but can review in the comfort of his own home or wherever there is internet access.  This has the advantages of cost and time efficiency. 

In this regard, Jurists Bar Review is offering JURISTS COMBO, which combines the structured regimen and face-to-face coaching of the traditional review with the convenience and flexibility of an online review.

CHOOSE YOUR BAR REVIEW CENTER WISELY.  There are three important things which you should take into account in choosing a bar review center:  The line-up of lecturers, the schedule, and the existence of a coaching or mentoring program.

The line-up of lecturers is important.   Get the line-up and study this carefully. In appraising the line-up, get the opinion of successful bar examinees and your law professors.   Word usually gets around among the bar reviewees and the law academe about the outstanding and the mediocre or irresponsible lecturers.   Pay special attention to the lecturers in the subjects in which you feel you are weak.          

The schedule is also of capital importance.   Some bar review centers draw up their schedule based on the availability of the lecturers rather than on topical continuity.  As previously stated, avoid bar review centers with hodgepodge schedules.   This will greatly undercut the effectiveness of your study.

If you have taken the bar more than three times, ensure that the bar review center is run by a recognized law school or that it has an accreditation agreement with one.   The Supreme Court will not allow you to sit for the bar examination unless you get a certification from such a bar review center. 

TAKE MOCK BAR EXAMS AND AVAIL OF THE SERVICES OF A BAR-EXAM COACH.   Another thing to look out for is if the bar review center has a coaching program.   The program should not be limited to the mere administration of mock bar exams, but should provide for one-on-one coaching wherein a coach reads and evaluates the examinee’s answers and then sits down and discusses the same with the examinee, seeking to identify the examinee’s strong and weak points, to remedy the latter, to coach the examinee on how to read and answer the bar exam questions, and in general to improve and maximize the examinee’s test-taking abilities.     

See to it that the mock bars replicate the bar examination (that’s why they’re called mock bars) and that there is a series of mock bars and coaching sessions (not just one or two) so that there will be adequate feedback and performance monitoring. 

Professor Mario Mainero, one of the foremost bar prep experts in the U.S., advises thus: “taking a practice exam under exam conditions is the best way to prepare for an exam.  If you do not take them as actual run-throughs, your mind and body will not become used to taking law school [bar] exams, and you are more likely to freeze up or perform at a less-than-peak performance level.”  (Dennis Tonsing, 1000 Days to the Bar).     

Analyzing and answering bar exam questions is not a matter of gut feel or intuition.   The examinee who thinks that it is enough to just read and attend lectures when preparing for the bar is taking a huge risk.   A bar-exam coach or mentor would be most invaluable in helping the examinee acquire the necessary competencies for succeeding in the bar exam.

The high mortality rate in the bar examination is traceable to the sole or over-reliance on passive study and the absence or lack of training and practice on bar exam strategies and tactics.  This matter has been raised as early as 1959 by Dean Wenceslao G. Laureta in the preface to his classic Secrets on How to Pass the Bar Examination (Rex Book Store, 1959 ed.)

Thus, it may be proper to remind the bar candidates some of the myths involved in the domain of bar examinations.  Almost invariably the bar candidates have the mistaken belief that by – – (1) Attending the best law schools; (2) Listening to lectures of renowned bar reviewers during review classes; and (3) Memorizing the law or the  rules of procedure, including doctrinal rulings will guarantee his passing the bar examinations.

Wrong.

There is no question that the above circumstances will help to enable the bar candidate pass the bar examinations.  But the blooming secret in this regard is simply this:  Present good answers that will make the examiner take notice.  Good answers anchored upon logical reasoning, written in readable English and more importantly, justified by appropriate legal authority. 

…

It would do well for the bar candidate to study carefully the manner in which answers are framed and the corresponding comments given.  He will not fail to see why a given answer is poorly presented and the value of the corresponding remedy to improve it in a manner acceptable to the examiner.  He must not make the tragic mistake of assuming that he knows all these things.  He must supplement his reading by actual practice in answer framing.  After all, one may know all the techniques on swimming which he can master from books on the subject, but until he jumps into the water, he will never learn to swim.  [Emphases supplied]

Bar exam strategies and tactics is a nuanced field which cannot be acquired from merely reading books and listening to omnibus lectures. The services of a competent bar exam coach or mentor would be most helpful.  A mock bar and coaching program is also in line with the recent pedagogical trend of shifting stress to “outcome-based education” from the conventional “input-based learning.”

The Supreme Court itself recognized the salient role played by mock bars and bar exam coaching.  The Guidelines for the 2014 Bar recommend thus:

Practice Exams

A good practice for law schools/review classes to observe is to hold practice examination sessions with the Bar candidates, both on the Essay and the MCQ formats. In evaluating these practice exams, attention should be given to both the law and the Bar candidate’s presentation and use of English. In many instances, incorrect English is more serious as a problem than the lack of precise knowledge of law, and has been the cause of high failure rates. [Emphases supplied]

In line with the Supreme Court’s observation, Jurists has brought back the lecture “English for Bar Examinees” in order to train the bar examinees write in correct, readable, and concise English.  This would be especially helpful for those who need improvement in their legal writing and English proficiency as the course would provide them with helpful tips in order to surmount their challenges. 

FOCUS ON THE FUNDAMENTALS IN YOUR BAR REVIEW.  The key is not really studying more but studying smart.   It is simply impossible to read during the five months of review the entire code provisions of a law much less the texts or annotations thereon.   Besides some code provisions and comments are unimportant for purposes of the bar and are seldom if ever asked in the bar.  

During your review, you need to concentrate only on the primary review materials:  a bar reviewer, the code provisions, and the bar review materials provided by the bar review center.   In reading the code provisions, do not read the entire code but only those which are important.   You know a code provision is important if it was discussed by your professor or bar review lecturer or mentioned in your bar reviewer.           

A useful supplement to your reviewer is the Lex Pareto Notes written by Zigfred Diaz, Maria Patricia Katrina de Guia, Alrey Ouano, Louella Matsumoto, Ma. Salud Barillo, Danell Fernandez, Nolito Dayanan, and Helenytte Yu.    This is a breakthrough work wherein the authors, applying the Pareto Principle to the field of bar exam review and forecasting, have found that approximately 80% of the bar exam questions are derived from 20% of the law.  The authors have pinpointed this 20% of the law on which the reviewee should spend 80% of his study time thus optimizing the effectiveness of his review.

Many reviewees ask me if they should also read the survey of bar exam questions and answers published by the U.P. Law Center.  My answer would be yes, but not as a primary review material but as a supplemental training material.  You may from time to time pick some questions from the Q&A and then answer them without looking at the suggested answers.   Needless to state the services of a certified bar exam coach to evaluate your answers and give written feedback is strongly advised as “self-coaching” has its drawbacks.  

TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH AND FITNESS.   Remember to exercise daily or at least three times a week.  Exercising improves blood circulation to the brain and makes one think more clearly.  It also builds up one’s resistance to sickness and infection and improves one’s stamina.  Remember that the bar exam is a grueling four-hour exam in the morning and another one in the afternoon. So I’m not greatly exaggerating when I say that it’s like training for a 20-kilometer run. I’m not saying though that you should train like a triathlete – – brisk walking or a short jog will do.       

Get enough sleep.  At least six to seven hours of daily sleep is advised.  Lack of sleep will result in drowsiness and sluggishness when studying, aside from making you susceptible to sickness or fatigue.      

Proper diet is often overlooked but it is of the utmost importance.  Observe a balanced and healthy diet, not forgetting fruits and vegetables. Please take it easy on fast food especially instant noodles!  (Well, from time to time fast food is alright but don’t make it your staple food).  A diet which would send a cardiologist into fits is not likewise appropriate for a bar reviewee.  For coffee drinkers, black coffee is the best.  Take it easy with the popular “3-in-1” coffee preparations which tend to contain a lot of sugar and fat.  Drink plenty of water when studying.

In fine take care of your health.   Good health is the foundation of an outstanding bar review. 

IMPROVE YOUR HANDWRITING.  Handwriting is of capital importance in the essay exams.  Your answers may all be logical and correct but if your handwriting is illegible all your hard work will go down the drain.   If your handwriting is difficult to read, the examiner will most probably not take the time to decipher your booklet, taking into consideration that he has about five thousand other booklets to read.  

You may think that your handwriting is legible when it’s actually not.   Take a mock bar examination and show your booklet to another person and have him read it.  You may be surprised to find that your handwriting is actually difficult to read.  If that is the case, work on improving your handwriting.  

DURING NOVEMBER AND THE BAR EXAM 

AVOID UNNECESSARY STRESS AND DISTRACTIONS.   Some stress and nerves is unavoidable during the review and exam week and in fact helps to drive you harder in your studies.  However undue and excessive stress and nerves is an enemy of the bar examinee as it results in lack of sleep and hinders proper thinking both while studying and taking the exam itself.  If you feel that you are unduly stressed or worried, learn relaxation techniques like yoga and deep breathing.   Prayer and meditation are powerful relaxation techniques. 

Ignore useless distractions.   Usually rumors of who the examiner is become widespread during this time and examinees worry themselves silly with the type of questions the rumored examiner usually asks and with obtaining notes and materials written by or about the rumored examiner.  This is just a useless exercise which would distract you from doing what should be done:  studying.  All examiners are in the main bound by an unwritten law that their questions should be on the basics of the law and on significant jurisprudence.   So just ignore rumors or information on the examiner’s identity and stick your nose to your review materials.   

The bar exam month features the annual frenetic paper chase by bar examinees.  Examinees go on a quest for the Holy Grail of the bar exams:  the red or blue notes from San Beda or Ateneo or the UP notes.   These notes are supposed to embody the answers or even “leaks” of bar exam questions.   This is balderdash.  I graduated from Ateneo and worked in the bar-ops.  I know that the so-called blue notes are simply compilations of probable bar questions with answers prepared by law students with a little assistance from the faculty.   While they are definitely helpful, you don’t have to wail and grind your teeth if you do not get them.   What is contained in the blue notes is more often than not also in your bar reviewers and review materials. 

One examinee I knew spent a lot more time looking for notes, tips, and leaks and compiling dossiers on the rumored examiners rather than actually studying.   He failed the bar five times and is now exploring career opportunities with the CIA. 

GET ENOUGH SLEEP ON THE NIGHT BEFORE THE EXAM.     This advice cannot be overemphasized.    Adequate sleep makes the mind sharper and allows us to recall what we have studied with facility.   So do not make the mistake of studying until the witching hour.   The extra hours of study is not worth it if you find yourself sleepy and thinking sluggishly during the bar exam. 

You should hit the sack by 9 p.m.   Do not panic if you find that you are unable to sleep.  Just relax and continue lying down in bed, at least your body will be rested.  But do not make the mistake of standing up and studying.   In that case you will lack both sleep and rest, and the chances of a disaster are multiplied threefold.   Ron de Vera slept for only an hour the night before the first Sunday exam and for only 30 minutes the night before the second Sunday exam of 2004.   He placed second.  (Lat et al., Bar Blues, p. 85).   Of course I’m not saying that you get only an hour’s sleep if you want to place in the top ten, what I’m saying is that there is no need for you to call 911 if you find yourself unable to fall into the arms of Morpheus.       

I advise against taking sleeping pills.   They often have the side effect of muddling up your thinking.  There was an examinee who, finding himself unable to sleep the night before the Civil Law exam, popped a sleeping pill.  He was able to sleep all right, but the next day he found himself unable to distinguish between loco parentis and crazy momma. 

REMEMBER TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS.  Before you start reading and answering the questions, take the time to first read and understand the instructions.  Quite a lot of examinees in their eagerness go straight to reading and answering the questions without bothering to read the instructions.  This could be disastrous.   

NEVER LEAVE ANY QUESTION UNANSWERED.   Even if you are clueless as to the answer to a question, give it your best try.   Never leave any question unanswered.   The examiner may feel slighted if you do not answer a question.  He may think that you felt that the question was not properly crafted that is why did not answer it.  Moreover a blank response will get you zero while giving it your best shot could net you 2 or 3 points which could spell the difference between flunking and passing.

MANAGE YOUR TIME WISELY.  Many examinees spend too much time on the first part of the exam only to find themselves rushing through the second part or worse running out of time and leaving some questions unanswered.    Learn to pace yourself properly.   Taking mock bar exams will help you learn how to pace yourself in an 18-to-20 question examination. 

DO NOT BE FLUSTERED BY “SHOCK AND AWE” QUESTIONS.   Those who took the 1991 Bar Examination (like me) will never forget the infamous first question in Political Law:  “What is the Writ of Amparo?  Discuss its constitutional basis.”     Considering that the only Amparo we knew of was Amparo Muñoz (the 1974 Miss Universe who won her title in Manila, if you’re a Millennial), the question had the effect of a sneak punch to the solar plexus.   I can still picture in my mind the bar exam room at MLQU, with everyone’s jaw plunging to the floor in utter shock.

Of course, now every law student knows what a writ of amparo is, but back then in 1991 B.G. (before Google), only a law student or law professor who had travelled to Latin America could have known of this most extraordinary writ.  

Other “shock and awe” questions include one which asked who the current president of the International Court of Justice was, one which asked for the meaning of the acronym ACID (from a speech of Chief Justice Artemio V. Panganiban), and another which asked the examinee to define the Denicola test in intellectual property law.

“Shock and awe” questions were trending in the 2015 Bar. In Political Law, bar examinees were asked to discuss the “evolution” of jus sanguinis under the 1935, 1973, and 1987 Constitutions.  In Labor Law, the word of the day was “equity of the incumbent,” an anachronism whose term of office had long ago expired.  In Civil Law, they were asked to define “depecage.”  In Commercial Law, the shock-and-awe word to define was “Jason Clause.”  In Remedial Law,  the examinees were confronted with the common-law terms, “larceny” and “voir dire.” It did not help any that “larceny” was used in a fact-setting which did not involve any unlawful taking of property but rather violence and sexual abuse, while “voir dire” is a term that a Filipino lawyer would be unfamiliar with unless he is an aficionado of American jury trials.

The examiners’ penchant for throwing screwball questions put the bar examinees in a serious funk. Many spent quite a bit of time accumulating a glossary of legal gobbledygook in the various bar exam subjects instead of studying the fundamentals and important jurisprudence.  I even heard a story (probably apocryphal) that a law school engaged a lexicographer to beef up its bar ops.

This brought back memories of the 1991 bar examination.  After the examinees were torched by the Amparo question in political Law, the succeeding preweek reviews were turned into a Gobbledygook chase.   The fad back then was the M&A (mergers & acquisitions) craze in Wall Street (remember Michael Milkin and Ivan Boesky with his infamous “Greed is Good” mantra).  In the mercantile law preweek, we parroted terms like “hostile take-over,” “leveraged buy-out,” “white knight,” “junk bonds,” and a plethora of other investment-bank junk rather, jargon.  I think this was partly to blame for the dismal pass rate of 17.81%.   An examinee who flunked the bar “leveraged” his experience to apply for and land a job in the M&A department of a leading investment bank.     

My advice is that a bar candidate should not spend precious time burning the midnight oil with Black’s Law Dictionary. A cost-benefit analysis would lead one to conclude that time spent on looking for and even studying obscure legal nomenclature would only result in dividends that are well, de minimis. Better to just study the basic legal principles and significant jurisprudence and encounter legal terms in the course of such study.

Moreover, screwball questions are not really expected to be answered correctly by the majority of the examinees (and even law professors) but are meant more to test the resolve and fortitude of one who aspires to be a lawyer.    Do not panic or lose hope if you do not know the answer to the question.  Just give it your best try and proceed to the other questions.

AFTER THE EXAM

DO NOT DISCUSS THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS.   After you have taken a bar exam in a particular subject, forget about it and concentrate on preparing and studying for the next bar exam subject.   After all you cannot undo what you have already written.   Avoid discussing the probable answers and avoid people who delight in discussing them.  The time spent on arguing and discussing the probable answers is better spent relaxing and preparing for the next exam. 

CONCLUSION

To paraphrase Bobby Knight, the key is not the will to pass.  Everybody has that.  It is the will to prepare to pass that is important. 

The bar exam is a formidable challenge but like any other hurdle it can be surmounted by assiduous planning and preparation.  The following quote from Steve Nash, a player of less than imposing physical attributes but who went on to become one of the NBA all-time greats, is inspiring:

You have to rely on your preparation.  You got to really be passionate and try to prepare more than anyone else, and put yourself in a position to succeed, and when the moment comes you got to enjoy, relax, breathe and rely on your preparation so that you can perform and not be anxious or filled with doubt.   

When your moment comes, enjoy it!

However, due to medical reasons, my wife can no longer have anything with caffeine. To accommodate this, I've developed a system through trial and error where I add just the right amount of beans to ensure I can hear the burr grinder run empty.

While this workaround has been effective, it's clear this situation isn't temporary. So, I'm considering getting a replacement. Initially, I thought about the CM7, but then I came across Jura's dual-hopper models—the J8 Twin and the Giga 10.

The J8 Twin seems less suitable for me because of its separate milk spout, which I think could disrupt my coffee-making routine. So I think it's between the CM7 and the Giga 10.

My main question is about Jura's non-removable brew group. I'm used to cleaning the CM6350's brew group by rinsing and brushing it manually. Why does Jura design their machines this way? Is there a specific reason for not allowing users to remove and clean the brew group themselves?",1,1737396698.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

1i5wmq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergirls/comments/1i5wmq2/motivating_self_to_take_morning_walksexercise/,Motivating self to take morning walks/exercise,"F/30s, ASD level 1 with avoidant behaviours, and in the last couple of years my basic fitness levels have slowly and perniciously fallen off a cliff. Not sure why; think it's a mixture of defeatism or ennui, long C0VID, unmasking or social avoidant-anxiety and an uncomfortable living situation (with family, caring for someone I don't really like or trust). 

Ftr I've never been very fit or ripped, always was quite lazy and never into sport or the gym, but there were times in the past I could and did at least do a few weekly workouts or one sports club.

Now it's to the point that I struggle to get up in the morning or before noon and leave the house, even just to walk leisurely around my neighbourhood (which is relatively safe and quiet, I'm lucky) to get some beneficial morning light in my eyes. Atm I don't really have a reason to go out for anything else, since I only do sporadic WFH, and we get deliveries to the house as part of care support for the elder we have at home.

Any more exercise than a walk like that feels overwhelming, like something I can't do or commit to anymore, even though a few years back I was doing easy online dance tutorials and light/mild free weights most days. It's like there's a curse hanging over me, or an emotional block telling me that it's pointless because I'll only lose all my progress (due to illness, stress, domestic workload or taking a busy job or something) and have to start again like I did every other time I tried to get in better shape. 

Another thing I've been struggling with over the last year is diet and hygiene. I don't have free constant access to my kitchen and I share a bathroom with three other adults, so it can be a struggle to find the time, privacy and peace I feel I need to get clean and fed. And as we know, proper fueling and hygiene is a must if one is exercising. My living situation means I can't even tempt myself to walk in the AM with a promise of a hot coffee or tasty breakfast for afters; we live rurally (no shops/cafes), I have to make my food the night before, because my grandmother gets upset if she doesn't have free run of the space in the daytime.

Would get an elliptical/treadmill for my bedroom that I could just roll onto, but my current room is extremely small (bed barely fits), I can't really afford it and my living space is communal with people who aren't able to practise good boundaries such as respecting someone else's equipment or time. And we have a dog, but he belongs to someone else and gets walked by them mostly. My last social case worker invited me on social rambles with other local people struggling with mental health, but I have horrible luck with groups like that, as I tend to end up as the empathic sponge or trauma dump for others.

Ultimately though, by now I'm sick of being skinnyfat, weak and too scared to do simple things that are good for me. Plus I know my time is short to get into proper shape before menopause hits. 

So I don't know what approach to take. Is it better to go very slow and just walk the fence around my house each day? (like my grandmother does...) Or do I just need to suck it up and jump in the deep end with a challenging or expensive class, force myself past the block with a shock? For the last three days I've managed to guilt myself into a couple of miles walking, but only at 5pm when the sun's going down, and I have to rush back home to collect or make dinner...",1,1737396519.0,aspergirls,0,1.0,False

I am a 24M that weighs 155lbs that drinks well over a gallon of water a day, often times closer to 2 full gallons of water every day. It has never been an issue for me and I have completed 75 Hard twice. Currently on day 20/30 of Phase 1 and I can easily get thru a gallon of water (often 2 gallons of water) and have never had any issues. I know numerous people who weigh less than me that easily finish the gallon of water with no complaints. Nearly 60% of the human body is made up of water. Drinking water has a multitude of health benefits. I would argue that drinking the gallon of water is by far the easiest task in the program. Enough is enough with the complaining. Then I see some people say “oh well it’s a lot of water on top of the coffee and energy drinks that I have every day.” Others say “drinking the gallon of water has zero benefit to me in my life.” Like seriously? Let’s stop normalizing complaining about water intake. Let’s stop making excuses for why you can’t drink a measly gallon of water every day. Instead, let’s normalize sticking to a program with zero deviation. Oh right, that will never be normalized because too many people like to take the easy route. ",2,1737396418.0,75HARD,0,0.75,False

I got several as a kid as well, but that was more like 4 cavities every couple of years. Since I was a teen/young adult it’s just been insane. I brush twice a day on *most days* and I go through phases of flossing and not flossing (I know!!) because sometimes it feels like even when I spend an entire year doing everything perfectly, mouthwash and floss and all, I just have more cavities than before. One dentist asked me how many energy drinks I have a day. Not if I have them, but how many. The answer is zero. And I didn’t even drink soda at the time. Just a coffee once a day like any other regular person. These days I drink soda sometimes too, not everyday though. Anyway, about 8 months ago I was diagnosed with Crohn’s. I’ve never had any mouth sores because of it but I have had GERD for as long as I can remember. I always wake up with the worst taste in my mouth, so brushing is the first thing I do in the morning.

Yet it doesn't fail ever time I feel lonely and as though I can't move on i miss him so much. He was my only parent and he did his best.  I just saw a post about a great dad and I had one of those. One of the best humans I ever met and till this day I strive to exhibit the parts of him everyone admired including me. 

In alanon I've learned that he didn't want to drink he just couldn't stop. In therapy I learned he didn't leave me it was just his time to go. 

The unrealistic part of me says its silly to be mourning so many years later but when he died I realized he was the only family I ever had.

 Sure meeting him at bars at 630am was weird but I drank my coffee and he his whiskey and we both left ready for a new day.  A tradition we held from the time I was 11 which moved from his kitchen to the bar when his at the time wife kicked me out. 

I knew things were wrong when he would miss our weekly date . If only I could travel in time but that wouldn't change anything. He left this plane and there is no brining him back. Yet how much I miss him. 

The more I lean into this uncomfortable feel the more I recognize he did something no one else ever did. He saw me for who I was and loved every part of my personality.  He was proud of me and I knew it. He was my confidante in a world where I could trust no one. He was the only person despite being drunk my whole life who always had time to talk to me, hold space and support me in my dreams. 

As an only child who is an orphan some times I think I need to get it together, I'm 40 years old. My daddy's been dead since I was in my early 20s and yet, it's almost like i miss him more every single day. I value all he did for me differently and mourn how much he gave me with his sheer presence. 


in the same feeling I blame his second wife for being abusive and giving him valid reasons to drink. I hate she survived him and wonder would he have found recovery if he had gotten away from her? Would he have found true partnership and given me a healthy mom if she never showed up? I know that's all irrelevant.  He's dead and all this is a waste of energy.

Things certainly haven’t been perfect between us. I can be fairly direct and blunt about my feelings, where she can well, not be. She has always held things in and seemingly let it out at a later time. My problem is I tend to just address things with out much thought and want to fix things right away and I have been trying to work on this. It’s just frustrating because there’s been times where I approach an issue in person with her and she will say she can’t talk about it. Alright Thats fair I don’t want to pry or force any thing. It’s just that time will go on and days turn it to weeks and it never gets addressed on her side and we never discuss as a couple. This has been happening for years and about 9 months ago, we had a rough argument after I expressed nothing was getting addressed by her. She threatened divorce a few times and we got caught up in emotion. During this time i also found out she had struck up a conversation over text with a male coworker and she had opened up to him a lot, meanwhile never opening up to me. (She cut this off just before I found out- nothing crazy inappropriate) I felt like I didn’t matter to her in a way and I told her this. A few days later she said she wanted to separate. We did and lived separately for about 6 months. We split taking care of our son best as we can and she’s now moved back in hoping for better as have I. But, it’s hard she still seems just as checked out. We’ve discussed her going to therapy (as am I) but she won’t actually start. She keeps saying she is working on it but this has been going on for almost 2 months. She just doesn’t seem interested in trying and hasn’t for a very long time. I try to suggest us doing things together like a date night, but she never commits to plans , but will randomly go out with friends almost every weekend or find some way to get out of the house and it can feel as if that’s time we could have together. Every once in a while we will have sex, currently we haven’t since my birthday a little over a month ago. I do sometimes see a small glimpse she cars like a random kiss on the cheek or a hug when she gets home from work or vice Versa. That’s why I haven’t totally lost hope. I try to spark occasional romance just getting her a coffee drink she enjoys occasionally or getting her flowers and writing a letter letting her know I appreciate her. She will say thank you and it’s sweet, but I don’t really feel anything like that done for me. She didn’t even get me anything for Christmas this past year. I just don’t feel much love and don’t really see her wanting to try or open up. 
I just don’t know what to do, she won’t go to couples therapy until she’s done individual a while - but that’s not even happening.

I get it, a lot of these places pay shit and the world sucks even more nowadays. But even on my worst days I would never hit strangers with rude remarks. Sure maybe the ones having a conniption Id sometimes snap back. But sheesh. 

Just a few examples. Popeyes employee straight up throwing a bag at my body. No idea what the deal was. Getgo worker said “good morning” as I approached, and it was loud as fuck in the store and I did respond a bit quietly in her defense, and she had the audacity to be like “AHEM EXCUSE ME YOUNG MAN? GOOD MORNING? SAY IT BACK!” like god damn? sorry? Came up to the counter to order at dunkin, literally just a medium hot coffee, and she let out a DRAMATIC sigh. Not a word. Just that. Like shit my bad? Didn’t even look busy and this one didn’t have a drive thru either. Looked like a few others were working too. (Coming from someone who worked at dunkin that’s kind of like, the objectively easiest thing to make. unless the coffee containers were being cleaned at the moment. but even then, could’ve just been like “might be a few minutes.”) And I could go on for hours.

TW: health anxiety and hypochondria.

I am in my 30s, and overall have been pretty anxiety free. When I was a kid, I would always be afraid of people dying, me dying, people leaving and not coming back, etc. This fear has come and went throughout most my life, resulting in pretty significant distress and maybe a mini panic attack every couple years. I do remember several times around the age of 10-14 where I would go outside because I felt like I couldn't breathe and would check to see if my fingernails were turning blue. Now that I am typing this out, I suppose I have never been anxiety free lol. Wow.

Anyway, at 28 I had a full blown panic attack when I found out I had fatty liver disease. This heightened state of anxiety lasted two days and my face had this crazy tingling sensation on one side that eventually convinced me to go to the ER, thinking I was having a stroke or something. Of course, everything was fine. Ever since that big panic attack I have been dealing with almost daily anxiety. Occasionally I would go weeks or months feeling pretty good. Other times, I would spend days feeling like I was on the brink of a panic attack.

A month ago, I had another panic attack after seeing a patient with mouth cancer. Due to ear and mouth pain I had been having, I was convinced I had mouth cancer. I was puking, crying, having diarrhea. My face began to tingle again, I felt disease, short of breath, and like my throat was closing. I left work to go to a walk in to get it checked out and the issue was that I had fluid behind my ear. Over the next 4 weeks I continued to go in and out of crying and panicking fits thinking there was something wrong. The tingling on my face persisted, and by that time I was convinced I had MS or a brain tumor or aneurysm. I was afraid to go to sleep or walk alone thinking I could collapse at any second.

After my first panic attack I went to a place that taught about meditation and really got into it. It was the only thing that helped in addition to some of the mantras I would repeat to myself. Ever since these have helped me, but they only bring me temporary relief in the moment. I knew I could no longer live like this.

I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist and she was really great. I couldn't have been luckier. I was started on lexapro and have been taking it for 4 days. I know most say it can take weeks to feel a difference, but I swear by the 2nd day I have noticed a change. One of the biggest being my mind is not CONSTANTLY active. I don't think of or plan conversations before they happen. I am not thinking of my future 4 decades in advance. I do not think of and fear and cry about me or my wife getting old and dying. My face hasn't tingled or felt like it is having microspasms for the past few days. The pressure in my forehead is gone. I haven't felt sick to my stomach (except today because I drank coffee- anytime my stomach feels bad I feel anxious, and vice versa). My breathing feels clearer, not really sure what that's about & maybe it's a placebo thing...or just the relief I feel in my body? I have had issues with brain fog but I also have sleep apnea and use CPAP but when my nose is really stuffed up I can't use it so I am not sure if that has improved yet or if it is related to anxiety or not so the verdict is still out on that one. Yesterday, I felt my brain fog was ""deeper"" in my mind, more central, rather than in my forehead if that makes sense, and then it lifted a few hours after I took my lexapro, but it could be that it dissipated once I got enough blood and oxygen flowing up there because I didnt use my cpap the night before lol.

I want to say that I am a very skeptical person and that after some bad experiences with psychedelics I was terrified of medication because I was terrified of having that feeling like I wasn't myself. After only 4 days I will say that I am upset that I didn't do this sooner. My mind feels relatively clear. I am living in the present. I feel more focused. I feel less fidgety. I actually don't think I've been shaking my legs for days now, and I don't feel like I'm going to explode if I'm not shaking them. My jaw isn't clenched. The only thing that I notice is that now that my mind isn't constantly active, I sometimes find myself just kind of staring into the imaginary abyss, not thinking, just sitting..but not worrying, or planning, or catastrophically thinking, or feeling a pain in my body thinking it's some disease. It's not a bad thing, just different. Now that my mind isn't so busy, I think I will finally have the mental capacity to do all the things I'd want to do but never start. I have even felt like leaving the house the past 2 days! I don't worry as much about my wife getting in a wreck or shot or anything like that. I think I may have ADHD as well, but I want to give this a couple months before I do anything else in terms of medication.

","In the ever-evolving world of weight loss solutions, the quest for effective, easy-to-use products is relentless. Among the myriad of supplements that flood the market, Java Burn has emerged as a standout contender, capturing the attention of health enthusiasts and casual users alike. This innovative product claims to revolutionize your daily coffee ritual by transforming it into a powerful fat-burning beverage. But does it live up to the hype? In this comprehensive review, we will delve deep into what Java Burn is, how it works, its ingredients and benefits, pricing options, potential side effects, and more. Whether you’re looking to enhance your weight loss journey or simply curious about this unique product, our deep dive will provide you with the insights you need to make an informed decision.

Let’s embark on this journey to uncover the details of Java Burn and see if it truly is the game-changer in weight management that it claims to be.

# What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is a unique weight loss supplement that comes in the form of a tasteless powder designed to be mixed with coffee. Its creators have harnessed the natural fat-burning properties of coffee and combined them with a proprietary blend of nutrients that aim to enhance metabolism and promote overall health. By simply adding one packet of Java Burn to your morning coffee, users are promised a boost in energy levels, improved metabolism, and support in their weight loss efforts.

The concept behind Java Burn is rooted in the belief that coffee itself can serve as a catalyst for weight loss, but it requires the right combination of ingredients to unlock its full potential. Java Burn’s formulation is based on extensive scientific research, aiming to provide a solution that is both effective and convenient for those who enjoy their daily cup of coffee. With this product, users can enjoy the familiar taste of their coffee while potentially facilitating fat loss and improving energy levels throughout the day.

By promoting Java Burn as a “super coffee,” the developers have positioned it as an essential addition to the morning routine of anyone serious about weight management. The product capitalizes on the popularity of coffee in everyday life, making it a simple yet effective option for those looking to lose weight without significant dietary changes or rigorous exercise routines.

# Does Java Burn Work?

The effectiveness of Java Burn has been a topic of interest for many potential users. Based on the scientific principles behind its formulation and the positive user testimonials, there is a strong argument that it can indeed work as intended. The combination of coffee with the proprietary blend of nutrients in Java Burn is designed to enhance metabolism, increase fat-burning, and support energy levels throughout the day.

Many users have reported noticeable results when incorporating Java Burn into their daily routine. These results may vary from person to person, depending on individual metabolism, lifestyle, and adherence to the recommended usage guidelines. However, the general consensus is that Java Burn can provide a helpful boost for those who are looking to enhance their weight loss efforts.

It is essential to note that while Java Burn can support weight loss, it is not a magic solution. For optimal results, it should be combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise. This aligns with the broader understanding of weight management, which emphasizes that supplements can be effective tools but should not replace healthy lifestyle choices.

In summary, Java Burn appears to work for many users by leveraging the natural benefits of coffee and enhancing them with its unique formula. While individual results may vary, there is enough evidence to suggest that it can be a valuable addition to a weight loss regimen.

# The 7-Second Coffee Loophole

The 7-second coffee loophole is an intriguing marketing concept used to promote Java Burn, highlighting how easy it is to incorporate into your daily routine. According to the product’s website, by simply adding Java Burn to your morning coffee—a process that takes just seven seconds—your body enters a “fat-melting mode,” making weight loss more accessible without the need for strict dieting or exercise.

While the idea is compelling, it’s important to approach it with a critical mindset. The 7-second coffee loophole suggests that Java Burn can significantly accelerate weight loss, but it’s essential to understand that no supplement can replace the foundational principles of healthy living. The ingredients in Java Burn, such as green tea extract, L-carnitine, and chlorogenic acid, have been shown to aid in weight loss, but they should be viewed as supportive elements rather than standalone solutions.

For healthy and sustainable weight loss, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced diet and engage in regular physical activity. Supplements like Java Burn can complement these efforts, but they are not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, if you’re considering using Java Burn or any other dietary supplement, consulting with a healthcare provider before starting is always recommended to ensure it aligns with your individual health needs and goals.

**What are the ingredients in Java Burn?**

# Chlorogenic Acid

Chlorogenic acid is a key component of Java Burn, known for its potential to support weight loss and metabolic health. This compound, found primarily in coffee beans, is believed to help regulate blood sugar levels, making it easier for the body to manage fat storage and energy use. Research suggests that chlorogenic acid can help reduce glucose absorption in the intestines and improve insulin sensitivity, leading to better overall metabolic function.

In addition to its weight loss benefits, chlorogenic acid has been associated with various health benefits, including antioxidant properties that can help combat oxidative stress in the body. By incorporating chlorogenic acid into your daily routine through Java Burn, you may experience improved energy levels and enhanced fat-burning capabilities, making it a valuable ingredient for anyone looking to shed pounds.

# Camellia Sinensis

Camellia Sinensis, the plant from which green tea is derived, is another significant ingredient in Java Burn. This powerful botanical is renowned for its numerous health benefits, particularly its ability to support weight loss and promote overall well-being. The active compounds in Camellia Sinensis, including catechins and caffeine, work synergistically to enhance metabolism and increase fat oxidation.

Research has shown that green tea extract can help boost metabolic rate and assist in fat burning, particularly during exercise. By including Camellia Sinensis in Java Burn, users can harness the natural fat-burning properties of green tea while enjoying their favorite coffee.

Hey all,

I’m a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can’t help but feel empty I guess. Let’s fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Who are you, actually. How do you understand life and yourself. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

We could be awesome friends, want to try it out?",1,1737394798.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Let’s embark on this journey to uncover the details of Java Burn and see if it truly is the game-changer in weight management that it claims to be.

# What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is a unique weight loss supplement that comes in the form of a tasteless powder designed to be mixed with coffee. Its creators have harnessed the natural fat-burning properties of coffee and combined them with a proprietary blend of nutrients that aim to enhance metabolism and promote overall health. By simply adding one packet of Java Burn to your morning coffee, users are promised a boost in energy levels, improved metabolism, and support in their weight loss efforts.

The concept behind Java Burn is rooted in the belief that coffee itself can serve as a catalyst for weight loss, but it requires the right combination of ingredients to unlock its full potential. Java Burn’s formulation is based on extensive scientific research, aiming to provide a solution that is both effective and convenient for those who enjoy their daily cup of coffee. With this product, users can enjoy the familiar taste of their coffee while potentially facilitating fat loss and improving energy levels throughout the day.

# Does Java Burn Work?

The effectiveness of Java Burn has been a topic of interest for many potential users. Based on the scientific principles behind its formulation and the positive user testimonials, there is a strong argument that it can indeed work as intended. The combination of coffee with the proprietary blend of nutrients in Java Burn is designed to enhance metabolism, increase fat-burning, and support energy levels throughout the day.

Many users have reported noticeable results when incorporating Java Burn into their daily routine. These results may vary from person to person, depending on individual metabolism, lifestyle, and adherence to the recommended usage guidelines. However, the general consensus is that Java Burn can provide a helpful boost for those who are looking to enhance their weight loss efforts.

It is essential to note that while Java Burn can support weight loss, it is not a magic solution. For optimal results, it should be combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise. This aligns with the broader understanding of weight management, which emphasizes that supplements can be effective tools but should not replace healthy lifestyle choices.

In summary, Java Burn appears to work for many users by leveraging the natural benefits of coffee and enhancing them with its unique formula. While individual results may vary, there is enough evidence to suggest that it can be a valuable addition to a weight loss regimen.

# The 7-Second Coffee Loophole

The 7-second coffee loophole is an intriguing marketing concept used to promote Java Burn, highlighting how easy it is to incorporate into your daily routine. According to the product’s website, by simply adding Java Burn to your morning coffee—a process that takes just seven seconds—your body enters a “fat-melting mode,” making weight loss more accessible without the need for strict dieting or exercise.

While the idea is compelling, it’s important to approach it with a critical mindset. The 7-second coffee loophole suggests that Java Burn can significantly accelerate weight loss, but it’s essential to understand that no supplement can replace the foundational principles of healthy living. The ingredients in Java Burn, such as green tea extract, L-carnitine, and chlorogenic acid, have been shown to aid in weight loss, but they should be viewed as supportive elements rather than standalone solutions.

For healthy and sustainable weight loss, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced diet and engage in regular physical activity. Supplements like Java Burn can complement these efforts, but they are not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, if you’re considering using Java Burn or any other dietary supplement, consulting with a healthcare provider before starting is always recommended to ensure it aligns with your individual health needs and goals.

# What is Java Burn?

Its creators have harnessed the natural fat-burning properties of coffee and combined them with a proprietary blend of nutrients that aim to enhance metabolism and promote overall health. By simply adding one packet of Java Burn to your morning coffee, users are promised a boost in energy levels, improved metabolism, and support in their weight loss efforts.

The concept behind Java Burn is rooted in the belief that coffee itself can serve as a catalyst for weight loss, but it requires the right combination of ingredients to unlock its full potential.

# Does Java Burn Work?

The effectiveness of Java Burn has been a topic of interest for many potential users. Based on the scientific principles behind its formulation and the positive user testimonials, there is a strong argument that it can indeed work as intended. The combination of coffee with the proprietary blend of nutrients in Java Burn is designed to enhance metabolism, increase fat-burning, and support energy levels throughout the day.

Many users have reported noticeable results when incorporating Java Burn into their daily routine. These results may vary from person to person, depending on individual metabolism, lifestyle, and adherence to the recommended usage guidelines. However, the general consensus is that Java Burn can provide a helpful boost for those who are looking to enhance their weight loss efforts.

It is essential to note that while Java Burn can support weight loss, it is not a magic solution. For optimal results, it should be combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise. This aligns with the broader understanding of weight management, which emphasizes that supplements can be effective tools but should not replace healthy lifestyle choices.

In summary, Java Burn appears to work for many users by leveraging the natural benefits of coffee and enhancing them with its unique formula. While individual results may vary, there is enough evidence to suggest that it can be a valuable addition to a weight loss regimen.

# The 7-Second Coffee Loophole

The 7-second coffee loophole is an intriguing marketing concept used to promote Java Burn, highlighting how easy it is to incorporate into your daily routine. According to the product’s website, by simply adding Java Burn to your morning coffee—a process that takes just seven seconds—your body enters a “fat-melting mode,” making weight loss more accessible without the need for strict dieting or exercise.

While the idea is compelling, it’s important to approach it with a critical mindset. The 7-second coffee loophole suggests that Java Burn can significantly accelerate weight loss, but it’s essential to understand that no supplement can replace the foundational principles of healthy living. The ingredients in Java Burn, such as green tea extract, L-carnitine, and chlorogenic acid, have been shown to aid in weight loss, but they should be viewed as supportive elements rather than standalone solutions.

For healthy and sustainable weight loss, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced diet and engage in regular physical activity. Supplements like Java Burn can complement these efforts, but they are not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, if you’re considering using Java Burn or any other dietary supplement, consulting with a healthcare provider before starting is always recommended to ensure it aligns with your individual health needs and goals.

Let’s embark on this journey to uncover the details of Java Burn and see if it truly is the game-changer in weight management that it claims to be.

# What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is a unique weight loss supplement that comes in the form of a tasteless powder designed to be mixed with coffee. Its creators have harnessed the natural fat-burning properties of coffee and combined them with a proprietary blend of nutrients that aim to enhance metabolism and promote overall health. By simply adding one packet of Java Burn to your morning coffee, users are promised a boost in energy levels, improved metabolism, and support in their weight loss efforts.

The concept behind Java Burn is rooted in the belief that coffee itself can serve as a catalyst for weight loss, but it requires the right combination of ingredients to unlock its full potential.

# Does Java Burn Work?

The effectiveness of Java Burn has been a topic of interest for many potential users. Based on the scientific principles behind its formulation and the positive user testimonials, there is a strong argument that it can indeed work as intended. The combination of coffee with the proprietary blend of nutrients in Java Burn is designed to enhance metabolism, increase fat-burning, and support energy levels throughout the day.

Many users have reported noticeable results when incorporating Java Burn into their daily routine. These results may vary from person to person, depending on individual metabolism, lifestyle, and adherence to the recommended usage guidelines. However, the general consensus is that Java Burn can provide a helpful boost for those who are looking to enhance their weight loss efforts.

It is essential to note that while Java Burn can support weight loss, it is not a magic solution. For optimal results, it should be combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise. This aligns with the broader understanding of weight management, which emphasizes that supplements can be effective tools but should not replace healthy lifestyle choices.

In summary, Java Burn appears to work for many users by leveraging the natural benefits of coffee and enhancing them with its unique formula. While individual results may vary, there is enough evidence to suggest that it can be a valuable addition to a weight loss regimen.

# The 7-Second Coffee Loophole

The 7-second coffee loophole is an intriguing marketing concept used to promote Java Burn, highlighting how easy it is to incorporate into your daily routine. According to the product’s website, by simply adding Java Burn to your morning coffee—a process that takes just seven seconds—your body enters a “fat-melting mode,” making weight loss more accessible without the need for strict dieting or exercise.

While the idea is compelling, it’s important to approach it with a critical mindset. The 7-second coffee loophole suggests that Java Burn can significantly accelerate weight loss, but it’s essential to understand that no supplement can replace the foundational principles of healthy living. The ingredients in Java Burn, such as green tea extract, L-carnitine, and chlorogenic acid, have been shown to aid in weight loss, but they should be viewed as supportive elements rather than standalone solutions.

For healthy and sustainable weight loss, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced diet and engage in regular physical activity. Supplements like Java Burn can complement these efforts, but they are not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, if you’re considering using Java Burn or any other dietary supplement, consulting with a healthcare provider before starting is always recommended to ensure it aligns with your individual health needs and goals.

By incorporating chromium into the Java Burn formula, users may experience a more balanced approach to weight management, making it easier to stick to their goals without succumbing to unhealthy cravings.

# L-Carnitine

L-Carnitine is an amino acid derivative that plays a crucial role in the body’s energy production process. It is responsible for transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are oxidized and converted into energy. This process is particularly beneficial for individuals looking to lose weight, as it enhances the body’s ability to burn fat for fuel.

In Java Burn, L-Carnitine is included to support metabolic health and boost energy levels. By promoting efficient fat utilization, L-Carnitine can help users achieve their weight loss goals more effectively. Additionally, this ingredient may also enhance exercise performance, making it a valuable addition for those who incorporate physical activity into their weight loss journey.

# L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves, particularly green tea. It is known for its calming effects on the mind and body, helping to reduce stress and promote relaxation without causing drowsiness. In the context of Java Burn, L-Theanine serves to balance the stimulating effects of caffeine from coffee, providing a smooth energy boost without the jitters often associated with caffeine consumption.

The inclusion of L-Theanine in Java Burn not only enhances the overall experience of enjoying a cup of coffee but may also support cognitive function and improve focus. By promoting a sense of calm and well-being, L-Theanine can help users stick to their weight loss goals by reducing stress-related eating and improving overall mental clarity.

# Vitamin Complex

The vitamin complex in Java Burn provides a range of essential nutrients that support overall health and well-being. Vitamins play a crucial role in various bodily functions, including metabolism, immune support, and energy production. By including a vitamin complex in the Java Burn formula, users can benefit from enhanced nutrient absorption and overall vitality.

The vitamins in Java Burn work synergistically with the other ingredients to support weight loss efforts and improve metabolic function. This comprehensive approach ensures that users not only feel energized and focused but also receive the nutritional support needed to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Coffee lovers, rejoice! Java Burn makes your brew a fat-burning machine.

I work a very busy corporate job throughout the week. My good friend, who is a full time artist, asked me late last week to hangout this upcoming Monday after work. One of the things we like to do is have art nights at her art studio, so that was going to be the plan for Monday evening. On Sunday evening, I checked my work email and saw that my VP added a meeting to my calendar for Monday that would interfere with the time I was going to meet my friend (I was off Friday, so didn't see until Sunday night). I just signed a new job offer last week so I knew this meeting is important to attend. Art nights take some prep in order to set up for, so I felt like I would be rushing to make it on time after work, and wouldn't have as much time to relax. I ended up texting my friend apologizing, explaining the situation, and asking if we could reschedule to a better day/time. My friend responded upset and said this is the third time I've bailed on art night (I bailed and rescheduled once 4 months ago due work being too busy, and once 3 months ago due to being sick, but have had 4 art nights with her in a row ever since then, and also got coffee with this friend 2 weeks ago). I responded apologizing again, explaining how I just got a new job so work is a bit crazy at the moment, and then expressed that I'm realizing weeknights are a tough for me with my work schedule and suggested that a Friday night, or anytime on Saturday or Sunday would work better. My friend responded saying that it’s just hard to plan to have art night with me since it's ""an easy thing to just bail on.""

I feel misunderstood and a little insulted. On one hand, I feel bad for canceling and asking to reschedule, but I truly have a crazy busy work schedule right now. I would love to hangout with my friend and do a day/time that works for us both. I also just invited this friend on Friday night to go bowling, but she couldn't make it, so it's not like I don't want to hang out.

I'm not really sure how to respond without inflaming the situation. She did not seem receptive to my apology or explanation, so I feel like maybe it's best to leave it alone. Do you have any advice on what I can do to remedy the situation? Apologize again? ",1,1737394599.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Hey all,

I’m a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can’t help but feel empty I guess. Let’s fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Who are you, actually. How do you understand life and yourself. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

1i5vs8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1i5vs8d/a_list_of_every_good_to_bad_on_carnivore_and/,A list of every good to bad on carnivore and beyond ,"I was curious to find out my own research on what carnivore advocates and in terms of the science its very little.

So that led me down a rabbit hole of, if you could list everything in food, what would be the best things for our health to the worst things, here is that list:

**Best to Worst according to my research of what a human body thrives off, what we can have in moderation and what we should avoid according to the literature. Its funny because when summarized its lion, carnivore or keto.**  

1. **Complete Proteins**
   * Critical for building and repairing tissues, supporting immune function, and enzyme production. Found in meat, eggs, and dairy.
2. **Bioavailable Nutrients (Iron, Zinc, Calcium, Magnesium, Selenium, Salt)**
   * Essential for bodily functions, with animal sources being highly bioavailable.
3. **Essential Fats (Saturated and Monounsaturated Fats)**
   * Vital for energy, hormone production, and cellular health. Found in fatty cuts of meat and animal fats.
4. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**
   * Anti-inflammatory and crucial for overall health, found in fatty fish and grass-fed meats.
5. **Fat-Soluble Vitamins (A, D, E, K2)**
   * Important for vision, bone health, immunity, and reducing inflammation. Highly bioavailable in animal sources.
6. **Vitamin B Complex**
   * Critical for energy metabolism, nervous system health, and red blood cell production. Abundant in animal foods.
7. **Taurine**
   * Important for heart health, brain function, and electrolyte balance. Found in meat and seafood.
8. **Carnitine**
   * Supports fat metabolism and energy production. Found in meat and essential for heart and muscle health.
9. **Choline**
   * Crucial for liver function, brain development, and nervous system health. Found in egg yolks and liver.
10. **Collagen and Gelatin**

* Important for joint health, skin elasticity, and gut lining. Found in bone broth and connective tissues.

**Diets: Lion diet, carnivore**

**Supportive for Overall Health:**

1. **Glutamine**
   * An amino acid that supports gut health and immune function, essential for maintaining overall wellness.
2. **Amino Acids (Essential and Non-Essential)**
   * Building blocks of protein, crucial for muscle repair, immune function, and neurotransmitter production.
3. **Glycine**
   * Important for sleep, detoxification, and collagen production, found in connective tissues.
4. **Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA)**
   * Found in grass-fed meats and dairy, supports fat loss and reduces inflammation.

Diets: Lion diet, carnivore, keto

**Neutral but Optional on a Carnivore Diet:**

1. **Probiotics (Fermented Foods)**
   * Beneficial for gut health, digestion, and immunity, but not a focus on a carnivore diet (except for certain fermented animal products).
2. **Creatine**
   * Enhances energy production, muscle performance, and brain health. Naturally found in meat, may be an additional support for active individuals.

**Diet: Lion diet, carnivore, keto**

**Potentially Negative or Not Required:**

1. **Anti-Inflammatory Properties**
   * While the carnivore diet can have inherent anti-inflammatory effects, additional anti-inflammatory compounds are less necessary.
2. **Polyphenols**
   * While beneficial for some, carnivore proponents argue they are unnecessary, as the body naturally manages oxidative stress.
3. **Antioxidants**
   * The low-carb nature of the carnivore diet reduces oxidative stress, decreasing the need for dietary antioxidants.
4. **Fiber**

* Fiber produces butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) that's produced in the colon through bacterial fermentation however this is not needed when insulin levels are low. Butyrate is also an exogenous ketone that the body produces when fasting or on a ketogenic diet.

**Diet: Lion diet, carnivore, keto**

**The list of things below are all things which can be of concern and are not in the lion, carnivore or keto diet. I have also against each of these said which of these can be consumed in addition that are on the border:**

**Nutrients or Compounds of Concern (Negative Impact):**

1. **Omega-6 Fatty Acids**
   * Excess intake leads to chronic inflammation and metabolic issues. Carnivore diet naturally avoids these when focusing on animal fats.
2. **Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFAs)**
   * Found in seed oils, associated with inflammation and oxidative stress.
3. **Sugar (Sucrose)**
   * Not a focus on carnivore diets, but pure sucrose may be seen as less harmful than fructose.
4. **Glutens**
   * Highly inflammatory for those sensitive or intolerant, linked to gut permeability.
5. **Plant Hormones and Estrogen-Mimicking Compounds**
   * Phytoestrogens in plants (like soy) may disrupt endocrine function in high quantities.
6. **Alkaloids**
   * Found in nightshades, may trigger inflammation in sensitive individuals.
7. **Tannins**
   * Can inhibit iron absorption but may be less harmful compared to other anti-nutrients.
8. **Lectins**
   * Anti-nutrients that can impair digestion and disrupt gut barriers.
9. **Saponins**
   * Soap-like compounds that can damage gut linings in sensitive individuals.
10. **Goitrogens**

* Found in cruciferous vegetables, may interfere with thyroid function in iodine-deficient individuals.

1. **Mold and Mycotoxins**

* Found in grains, nuts, and plants; can be toxic and harmful to the liver and immune systems.

1. **Additives and Preservatives**

* Artificial chemicals in processed foods can disrupt gut microbiota and hormonal systems.

1. **Processed Meats**

* High in sodium, nitrates, and unhealthy fats, potentially leading to cancer risks.

1. **Trans Fats**

* Found in partially hydrogenated oils and processed foods, linked to heart disease and inflammation.

1. **Artificial Sweeteners**

* Disrupt gut bacteria, cause cravings, and may have long-term health implications.

1. **High-Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS)**

* Contributes to obesity, insulin resistance, and liver fat accumulation.

1. **Dairy (Lactose Intolerance)**

* Can cause digestive discomfort and inflammation for those sensitive to lactose.

1. **Caffeine (Excessive Consumption)**

* Excessive intake may lead to insomnia, anxiety, and digestive disruption.

1. **High-Sodium Foods**

* Excessive sodium intake can lead to high blood pressure and kidney issues.

**NOT CARNIVORE OR LION DIET**  
This did lead me to wonder in terms of actual health, if I really need to eat beyond carnivore then what would i have, whats the least impact areas of the bad stuff and this is what i found:

# Ok to Consume in Moderation (once a week)

1. **Sugar (Sucrose)**
   * A small amount of sucrose occasionally won’t drastically impact your insulin levels. However, it's better to choose natural sweeteners (e.g., honey or maple syrup) over refined sugar, and keep it as an occasional treat like once every 3 months as a treat, its best to eat protein and then after have some raw honey if you really want to try something out of the diet.
2. **Tannins**
   * Foods like tea, red wine, or nuts that contain tannins can be consumed in moderation. While tannins can reduce iron absorption, their effect is not significant enough to be harmful for most people, especially if balanced with a meat diet.
3. **Caffeine (Excessive Consumption)**
   * A moderate amount of caffeine (e.g., coffee or tea) is fine for most people.
4. **Dairy (Lactose Intolerance)**
   * If you're not lactose intolerant, full-fat dairy products (like cheese or butter) are fine in moderation, less for females with the affects on oestrogen.

# Definite ""No-No"" List

1. **Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFAs)**
   * Avoid seed oils (e.g., sunflower, soybean) as they’re inflammatory and can cause oxidative stress. Stick to healthier fats like olive oil, avocado oil, or butter.
2. **Omega-6 Fatty Acids**
   * Excessive Omega-6 from processed vegetable oils or processed foods can cause inflammation and metabolic issues. If you consume Omega-6 in moderation, focus on balanced sources like fatty fish and grass-fed meats, but avoid highly processed sources.
3. **Polyphenols**
   * While generally beneficial, polyphenols from plant-based sources can disrupt ketosis, especially in large quantities. Opt for small amounts of berries or dark chocolate if you want a treat.
4. **Lectins and Saponins**
   * These are anti-nutrients found in beans, legumes, and grains that can affect digestion and gut health. It’s best to avoid these, especially when you're trying to stay in ketosis.
5. **Goitrogens**
   * Goitrogens in cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cauliflower) can interfere with thyroid function if consumed in excess. If you’re prone to thyroid issues or want to avoid interfering with metabolism, limit them.
6. **Mold and Mycotoxins**
   * Grains, nuts, and plants can contain mold and mycotoxins, which can negatively affect liver health and immune systems. It’s best to avoid grains entirely and be cautious with nuts, especially when consuming processed forms.
7. **Processed Meats**
   * Although they’re often convenient, processed meats like sausages, hot dogs, and deli meats contain preservatives (e.g., nitrates) and unhealthy fats, which are linked to health risks like cancer. Limit these in your diet.
8. **Trans Fats**
   * These fats are found in partially hydrogenated oils and many processed foods. Trans fats increase the risk of heart disease and inflammation. They should be completely avoided.
9. **High-Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS)**
   * HFCS is a highly processed sugar that is particularly harmful for insulin resistance and liver health. It’s a definite ""no"" and should be avoided at all costs.

Any way, my research is ongoing, but if you ever wonder what are all the good and bad things to do with carnivore, this is a good start. Normally the answers i read are carnivore diet is just meat, salt and fat and I say why? and there is no answer. this is a good summary of about 20 things that the human can consume in food and it says what are good, the ok and the ugly.

I hope this helps people understand more the benefits on long term health.

1. Carnivore for 4 months
2. Lost 24 pounds
3. Sleeping better
4. Snoring gone
5. Back pain gone
6. I follow it everyday accept on holidays abroad, thats my rule.

1i5vnxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i5vnxx/aitah_for_believing_that_when_communities_face/,AITAH for believing that when communities face catastrophe that they can find a better life by moving abroad?,"Picture this: you’re walking down a quiet street in a small town far from any coastline, and suddenly the scent of sizzling spices, the sound of a familiar song, or a brightly colored flag fluttering in the breeze transports you halfway across the world. It’s a little reminder that no matter how far people travel, home isn’t just a place—it’s something they carry with them.

For those whose lives have been upended by war, natural disasters, or economic hardship, finding home again can be an adventure filled with resilience, laughter, and, let’s be honest, a lot of good food. Take, for instance, the families who rebuilt their lives after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. They settled in communities thousands of miles from their coastal villages, bringing with them an unshakable spirit—and recipes that can make anyone feel like they belong.

In a small town in Sweden, a group of Sri Lankan families, displaced after the tsunami, have turned their sorrow into spice. They opened “Ceylon Delights,” a restaurant where the walls are adorned with the bright lion of the Sri Lankan flag, and the air is filled with the smell of coconut and curry leaves. Locals come in for their morning roti and end up staying for the warm conversations and stories. “We lost our home,” says Priya, one of the owners, “but here, we’ve found family in unexpected places.”

And then there’s the case of New Orleans natives who fled after Hurricane Katrina. Scattered across cities like Houston and Atlanta, they brought their music, their gumbo, and their famously warm hospitality. Walk into any one of their restaurants, and you’ll find neighbors tapping their feet to live jazz, while long-time residents swap hurricane stories with newcomers over a bowl of crawfish étouffée. “Houston welcomed us,” says Charles, a former Ninth Ward resident, “but we brought the party.”

Communities like these thrive not just because of their shared experiences, but because they’ve found ways to blend the old with the new. In Germany, Syrian refugees who left their homes due to war have started thriving businesses—from bustling kebab shops to cozy bakeries serving baklava and coffee strong enough to remind them of Damascus. And they’ve found friends in their new neighbors, too. “At first, I worried people wouldn’t understand us,” says Omar, who runs a popular café in Berlin. “But now, my German neighbors know how to say ‘shukran’ (thank you), and I can ask for bratwurst in perfect German.”

Similarly, Palestinian communities have flourished across the world in countries like Germany, Sweden, Canada, Australia, Chile, the United States, and other parts of Europe. Whether they are setting up thriving businesses in Berlin’s bustling Neukölln district, creating community hubs in Canadian cities like Toronto and Montreal, or opening family-run restaurants serving fragrant maqluba and knafeh in Sydney, Palestinians have brought their enduring spirit and rich culture to every corner of the globe. In Santiago, Chile—home to one of the largest Palestinian communities outside the Middle East—families gather in social clubs where they celebrate weddings, play soccer, and keep traditions alive through dance and storytelling. “We may be thousands of miles away,” says Yasmeen, a second-generation Chilean-Palestinian, “but every bite of my grandmother’s hummus reminds me where we come from.”

Faith, culture, and a bit of good humor often help people settle in and make a new country feel like home. In Canada, a group of Afghan families displaced over the past two decades gather every Friday for prayers and, of course, a massive pot of mantu dumplings. Their mosque has become a hub of laughter, shared wisdom, and the occasional friendly debate about whether Canadian hockey will ever truly replace cricket in their hearts (spoiler: it won’t).

And let’s not forget the surprising friendships that blossom when cultures meet. In a small town in Italy, a group of Bangladeshi families have not only opened successful textile shops but have also introduced their new neighbors to the wonders of samosas and chai. “They taught us to love spicy food,” jokes Marco, a local. “And we taught them how to make a proper espresso.”

Resettling after a disaster is never easy, but as these communities show, it’s not just about surviving—it’s about thriving. Whether it’s through food, music, faith, or a shared love for soccer (because let’s be honest, soccer transcends borders), these resilient individuals create little pockets of home wherever they go.

So the next time you stumble upon a family-run Ethiopian café in a quiet Midwest town, or hear the joyful strains of Caribbean music in an unexpected place, take a moment to step inside. Order something unfamiliar, ask a few questions, and you might just find yourself with new friends—and maybe even a new favorite dish.

As a silly exercise I'm putting together a spreadsheet with a basket of goods (commodities and services) important to my life and tracking their price changes every quarter. I recognize that this is not going to be a thorough measure of inflation or anything, this is just a little snapshot of price change over time that is very localized and personalized to me. 

My question is how to make sure that one item with a higher purchase price doesn't overtake the whole index. I am including things like: A price of a small cup of coffee at Peet's, the price of a vegetarian crunch wrap supreme at Taco Bell, etc. I am also including the price of a bottle of wine that is sort of like the house wine in my family. While not the most expensive wine, it is certainly much pricier than a cup of coffee.

I am concerned that a price increase in the wine will skew the measurements of my index. For example, a 10% increase in said wine's price would be the equivalent of, roughly, the starting price of a cup of coffee.  How would one deal with this in constructing a serious index of goods and services. Measure the price as X times .25 to bring it down closer to the starting prices of the other goods?",1,1737394203.0,AskEconomics,2,1.0,False

Hey all,

I’m a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can’t help but feel empty I guess. Let’s fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Who are you, actually. How do you understand life and yourself. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

We could be awesome friends, want to try it out?",1,1737394199.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Not really sure how to word this but see how it goes. Interesting to know people’s thoughts. 

Anyway, there’s this girl that I like which I haven’t known for too long. We work in the same profession but different places. I first met her at kind of a network meeting (both our places of work fall under the same trust) didn’t really talk to her at all but did communicate briefly through email. 

Last week as part of a wider network meeting she was there (I wasn’t aware she was gonna be there) there were like 4 different locations you could be at. Anyway coincidentally I ended up sitting next to her for this thing, ended up talking to her for the 2 and a half hours mainly about work. Towards the end I asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee, she initially said no. A few minutes later she turns around and changes her mind. We leave this thing, she mentions that she only has 20 minutes before her bus. We grab a coffee and were there longer than 20 minutes probably around 40 ish. It was genuinely one of the best conversations I’ve had in a long time. I ended up asking for number which she said she had recently changed it and couldn’t remember it off the top of her head. But then she gave me her phone to put my number in (didn’t ask her to do that). 

But she never texted me… I also never asked her too (I should’ve have). Quite disappointed by that because I could tell we were quite similar and just how we got on. 

I emailed her the next morning which she mentioned she totally forgot (Not sure if it was genuine) but even replies to that were vague. I will add that she seems very work driven and professional in that sense. 

We have another network meeting in just over a week - I don’t know if she is gonna be there. I’m hoping to just be straight up with her and tell her that I like her? (That’s worded poorly but too that affect). But if she isn’t then what can I do? There’s a chance that I wouldn’t see her again and if I do it won’t be for a while. 

For context, a couple of my friends who are female can’t work this out. One thinks she’s not interested and another thinks that she’s just oblivious and doesn’t realise I’m trying to get to know her. My gut tells me she’s not interested but I don’t know that was the first time I’ve properly spoken to her.  ",1,1737394181.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1i5vm4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1i5vm4b/i_would_love_commutationpardon/,i would love commutation/pardon,"I could use some help, I have been homeless and incarcerated for the last 10 years or so, in 2019 I was wrongfully convicted of a 211-strong armed robbery and received a violent strike in Santa Barbara county, Goleta, California, at a Chevron Gas station, it was the second time this county severely punished a mentally challenged homeless man.  I'm currently out on probation serving my sentence until 7/20/25  at a recovery house which my mom is having to pay for, it's not cheap, I'm just in the process of applying for SSDI for schizophrenia and mood disorder, and the courts have a habit of letting people out of jail and in debt.  
While incarcerated I communicated with my lawyer I wanted to attempt to fight the charge; no waive time, speedy trial.  I had thought that because the charge was bogus and during COVID, the county would show some sympathy and not want to waste money on a trial and drop the charge.  My lawyer said I would lose and would spend a year and a half locked up awaiting trial and they would punish me more intensely for not taking responsibility, which is not true.  After I pleaded out during a Zoom appointment I immediately tried to withdraw my plea and my lawyer called me a bitch, pussy, and a lawyer, which I was able to discuss with the head of the public defender's office and be awarded a conflict attorney while incarcerated during my first absconding violation.  
  
What happened was I was left outside in the cold in Goleta with no blanket, I was trying to find a way to head south to San Diego.  No rest and I went inside a chevron and grabbed a crummy cup of coffee and a pack of hostess donuts for breakfast, I tried to leave but I was tackled and got excessively restrained until the cops came. it's supposed to be on video tape but they won't release it to me. I didn't threaten anyone or physically assault anyone I just wanted to leave.  
  
I understand today I was guilty of attempted petty theft but no robbery, Santa Barbara Public Defender's office likes to call it an ""Estes robbery"" in Santa Barbara County, which it is not. It's the second time Santa Barbara made these accusations against me.  The first time real similar circumstances trying to eat breakfast outside a gas station off of Milpas, Santa Barbara.  
  
I found no justice while incarcerated, I nearly survived and escaped getting sent to Wasco on my second absconding violation.  I think we may want to rethink the idea of punishing someone for running away from the people who are hurting them.  
  
This last time my mom opted to pay for a paid lawyer, I wish we would have gone this route initially the charge happened during COVID. I was terrified but I had to stick up for myself at my last hearing on 12/19/24 in front of Judge Maxwell.  Although my lawyer was able to work some things out in the judge's chambers he nearly got me sent to prison; it's just my take but sometimes public defenders are just as good and my paid representation was unable to sort out the fundamental fact, regardless of what stage we were in the proceeding that I shouldn't have been charged with a violent strike, based on the necessity to eat, we never filed a Habeas **corpus** or any administrative action that would prove my recognizance, my family waited too long to get a paid attorney and I don't know what good it would have done anyhow, it's some real nasty stuff. Now my P.T.S.D is through the roof, and my moms picking up the bill of nearly $1000 at a sober living, I'm so lucky though because they wanted to send me to prison and then I'd still be on parole.  Also, jail is dangerous I was helping somebody who just arrived operate the phone, I eventually lost my patience told him to shut up, and he knocked one of my molars out, it hurt and I still needed to get the little existing pieces of the tooth pulled, heck it's been rough.  
I'm applying for S.S.D.I., I hear voices, I was eventually classified as mental health and the system still wants to prescribe poisoned anti-psychotics that increase the COVID population, that's just my take. I could also use help for a possession charge out of Ventura next week I don't have enough money to take the bus out there and I'm scared as it is, I also don't want to be cross-eyed. I had filed a haebus corpus before this last violation while in jail and I contacted the Earl Warren Supreme Court reception when I was absconding down south and nothing was received. As you can tell I struggle with my writing so it initially took a great effort to have Mr. Navarette correspond while I was in jail and fill it out by myself, same with the governor's pardon.  I still could use help with these possible avenues of relief. I think the cops intercepted this and a governor pardoned Mr. Newsom, I could use some help filing a pardon with the governor once again as well as the president. Please reach out to me if you can I'm on probation till 7/20/25and every day is sort of a struggle at the sober living, at least there is some pressure that I wish not to deal with, I have a hard time with people, I was able to finally apply with S.S.D.I over the phone at my local office, I don't know how I'm going to receive further contact with any of you since I can't solicit my email, nobody is responding to Ventura public defenders for the cite and release charge and if that goes to a warrant it will affect me later with social security. I also filed with Judge Navarette,  since I've been out and received confirmation, S288666, in the mail, which is great besides, I'm no lawyer and my reasoning resembled less cohesiveness than a third grader as it probably has done to you right now. Thanks for your support I'm looking forward to putting this behind me don't believe I will heal properly until I have been exonerated of a violent crime and be dropped to a misdemeanor.

and a DF-64 grinder with stock burrs. I have one 90° - 120° temperature strip on the heating element and  one 60° - 90°C temperature strip on the group head. I find it very hard to get predictable results out of this setup even though I am using it for almost 2 years now.

What I usually do is grinding 14g of coffee directly into the portafilter, distributing it with a needle-tool, put puck screen on the distributed grounds and then tamp it. I then wait until the temperature strip on the heating element reaches 110°C to pre heat the group head until the 90°C is fully saturated. After that I put the portafilter into the grouphead, lift the lever from bottom to top and wait until pre infusion coffee starts dripping. Then I press the lever down for 10-20s until it reaches its stop position.

Do you have any hints or tricks with this setup? I disassembled lever & piston twice already. The first time to do some cleaning, the second time because while lifting the lever the gasket got loose. I figured I was installing the lever the wrong way around after disassembling the first time. But now I am not sure. If you take a look at the picture - one hole is higher than the other. Installing it the wrong way will result in the lever pulling the piston too far up and messing with the gasket. Does this look correct to you?

1i5vlmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanGrupeHorror/comments/1i5vlmg/clownitis_klown_i_tis/,CLOWNITIS (Klown- I- Tis),"Walking through his front door, Henry called for his mother. Eerie silence is all he got in response, so he slowly and mindfully closed the door believing her to be napping. Still, an uneasy feeling boiled in his stomach, especially with the outbreak of the disease known as “Clownitis” spreading wildly in an unpredictable pattern.

This disease turned ordinary people into twisted iterations of clowns. If contracted the disease would enact an over production of melanin causing large unnatural brown or black shapes to form on the face resembling clown makeup. People with darker complexions would instead suffer from a vitiligo like whitening of their skin, turning their complexion a stark white with patches of their original skin tone resembling clown makeup. Their eyes held malice and their teeth would somehow double in length and width stretching the lips into twitchy, involuntary smiles. They would laugh in an over the top, animated clown laugh and did so sporadically. In addition to the outer changes were the changes within. The ghastly grinners regressed into a feral state unlocking a primal predator instinct that enhanced their speed and stamina. The horrific jokers were great hunters, preying on animals and humans alike. While feasting on the flesh of their victims they would ask (no one in particular) “Does this meat taste funny to you?” Unsettling as all that may sound it only gets worse, should the victim somehow survive the ordeal then in a day’s time they too would become infected and change into a grotesque clown.

Knowing all this the nine year old cautiously moved deeper into the house trying to be as quiet as he could. Rounding the kitchen corner, his mind started to run wild with thoughts of his mother transformed and waiting for him with a knife. To his relief he was in the clear, but he did notice light brown hairs scattered around the kitchen floor and counter top. Sprinkles of crusted blood trailed from the counter, across the floor and leading into the dining area. His pulse quickened and he unknowingly held his breathe. As he inched his way to the dining room, he told himself internally to turn and runaway; yet he still moved forward.

Reaching the doorway he gently gripped the wood and slowly he took a peek inside. His mother was sitting at the table with her back to him enjoying a meal.

“Hi son!” she said. Aside from her hair looking greasy she seemed normal, nothing else was out of place. Henry replied with hi and he felt the tension leave his body in slow pulsating waves. Feeling confident that his mother was normal he asked her why there was hair in the kitchen and what the red drips were. To which she simply replied, “Does this meat taste funny to you?” The boys fear returned instantly and arose with a heat like a wildfire. His mother turned to face him, Henry’s adrenaline made her movements seem slow, revealing her “CLOWNSFORMATION.” The boy’s legs gave out at the sight. He couldn’t believe it, his mother had been “CLOWNSFORMED” into a card carrying member of the Insane Clown Posse.

Her lips stretched thin over her newly enlarged, blood stained teeth. So thin that her skin had split open in random spots to allow her to create the widest smile he’d ever witnessed. Looking at the table he saw the scraps of his guinea pig, looking back to his mother he saw one of the guinea pigs arms twitching in between two of her box like teeth. The boy’s primal instincts for survival propelled him to his feet and he made a mad dash for the front door, exiting the dining area the same way he came. His mother started laughing wildly and loud. Henry reached the door and unlocked it. As he turned the knob he heard the chair his mother sat upon smack hard on the tile floor. The boy turned to look and saw his mother exit the dining room rapidly through the other door then jump over the back of the couch in the front room followed by a midair front flip that cleared the front of the couch. She landed a perfect dismount on top of the coffee table in the front room breaking through it with bare feet. The broken and splintered wood digging, jabbing and embedding itself in the bottoms of her feet, in between her toes and under her toe nails. The tears of a clown flooded her eyes with the pain she felt showing the boy that the infected were not completely mindless, although he didn’t understand the significance.

Her upper and lower mandibles spread open wide and expelled more loud laughter. Then while using over exaggerated steps she began to mime her way out of an invisible knee high barrier. Henry swung the door open and ran outside, his mother giving chase. She was only two steps behind him when the boy made a sharp right toward the driveway. Her body continued moving forward although she turned her head to face him. She pivoted her body and quickly changed direction, running again toward the boy. Henry had crossed the driveway and his mother was three steps in to her new direction when the boy’s stepfather drove up unexpectedly, hitting the 5’ 2” woman at a speed of seven miles per hour.

The impact bounced the woman off the front of the vehicle, her body making a horn sound when the two collided. She flew up in the sky and crashed onto the trash bins in front of the house, knocking them over and spilling the smelly contents inside. Quickly hopping out of his car, Henry’s stepdad popped open the trunk and opened a pack of zip ties he had just purchased. The six foot, bearded man used them to restrain the unconscious mother to the trash bin handles then called 9-1-1 to report the emergency.

The two sat on the sidewalk waiting for the police and ambulance when Henry started sobbing uncontrollably. His stepfather tried to console him the best he could, saying that all would be fine and that she would be cured in no time. He said this but he said it not knowing if it was at all possible.

Henry’s story is only one of many stories telling the chaos and carnage of carnival freaks. A world increasing in madness and filling with deranged clowns daily. The uninfected continued to fight for their lives just trying to survive each day in a world that’s become a psycho circus.",1,1737394060.0,JordanGrupeHorror,0,1.0,False

That’s when I found what I now call my secret weapon.  
  
At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.  
  
Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.  
  
The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.  
  
And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.  
  
Then came the physical changes.  
  
I’d always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn’t feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.  
  
But the best part wasn’t just what I saw in the mirror—it was how I felt inside. There’s a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you’re living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.  
  
I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn’t some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I’d been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised—and more.

Ik there r other factors as well like the environment, what r u doing, how much u slept the day before, etc …… as of now I don’t really respond well to 6 sachets, earlier I used to feel like I’m locked in but its not the same now so I just wanted to know ki how much caffeine does this one contains so I can calculate my daily (occasionally) maximum consumption…..

So I've done what I think your supposed to do for my best chance at a good espresso. 

I've cleaned my equipment which includes:
-descaled recently and ran three tanks of distilled water afterwards. 
-cleaned off the puck screen and underneath it 
-My grinder is completely clean 

My equipment: 
-Delonghi EC702 espresso maker 
-Double shot basket 
-1zpresso jx pro grinder 
-Filtered water from my fridge 

My brewing method: 
-I preheat the espresso maker for about 15 min before using 
-My grind settings seem dialed in okay. Getting 25- 30 seconds for a double shot with an even flow. Doesn't seemed choked up at all or too much flow 
-I'm using the correct diameter tamp and do my best to compress it as evenly as possible 

My coffee grounds: 
-Viking Blend Espresso (Designed for an intense, complex espresso) Roast date of Auguest 12, 2024 -Starbucks Espresso Roast (Notes of rich molasses & caramel) Use by date of April 2025 

No matter what I do to adjust the grind setting to be slightly less course or more course the flavor profile is extremely bitter. Like too bitter for even me and I'm attracted to bitter flavors. It's missing all the flavor notes because they're being overpowered. 

Am I missing something something obvious here? The espresso maker was bought new and I believe I've made at most 40 espressos on it. It seems to operate normally.",1,1737393875.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

A while back I forgot my charger on holiday and I used my Deck at night to charge my phone. The issue was that my Deck completely got its battery drained which led to the so called ""black screen of death"", where the deck would turn on (you can hear the power chime, fans start spinning, and the trackpads vibrate on input but the screen stays black - I am on the LCD version, not even the blacklight would turn on).

Unfortunately draining the battery is not very common as the Deck will turn itself off before getting to this point, and because of this the number of posts/guides on the issue are few between and also most of them outdated.

I spoke to Valve about it but after a week going back and forth they were only willing to offer me a paid repair. As at the time I learned that it had something to do with the BIOS it seemed a bit expensive for a known software issue (something that the support rep did not want to acknowledge as a software issue even though I provided documentation that others who were in the same situation got there because they drained their batteries completely and had the same symptoms as described above).

A week or so I found [this blogpost](https://www.stanto.com/steam-deck/how-to-update-or-flash-your-steam-deck-bios-from-crisis-mode/) which goes over the fix for a black screen of death in detail but unfortunately I wasn't able to do the final step and /r/SteamDeck [wasnt able to help](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1i2sfx1/reset_bios_doesnt_finish/)

Then earlier today I found https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1i2sfx1/reset_bios_doesnt_finish/, the only requirement for the tool is that you can boot into desktop mode and a root password (if none is set you will be prompted when running the script).
With the tool I was able to backup my current BIOS and flash an older version in a GUI, straight from Desktop mode (ie no need to turn off the deck and turn it on with some keypress combination).

So far my Deck seems to be working without any issues, hopefully if someone else has the issue, my post will be able to help them out as well.

ps: I am not affiliated with any of the authors linked in this post (except for my own post on Reddit), but I will be sending them some coffee funds as they saved me from spending 200 euro on a Valve RMA",5,1737393871.0,SteamDeck,0,1.0,False

On Friday, we went out for coffee, and for both of us, it was just supposed to be a quick date, but we ended up spending the whole day together. The next day, I was near her workplace, and she said she wanted to see me. She asked for my number, and we arranged to meet during her break.

I should mention that during the first date, we kissed, and there was a strong connection from the very beginning. On Sunday, her ex “almost something” reached out to her, and although she apparently doesn’t plan on getting back with him, she told me she realized she’s not ready to meet someone new at the moment. She also said she loves spending time with me and that if I’d like to get to know her in the future, she’d be open to it.

What do you all think about this? I feel pretty dumb and used, although I can’t deny the connection was incredible.

I would like to know the opinion of older people, my age, or younger people regarding the situation that happened today. When I was at school, someone stole my bank card and started spending money while I was still in class. The problem is that I did not remember where exactly my card was, so I thought that my mother or uncle took it to go to the store while I was at school, so I did not pay much attention to it. At that time, only 310 hryvnias were spent. After that, I returned home and forgot about this situation. My mother, her friend and I were sitting at the table drinking coffee, when suddenly money began to be debited from the card again. I asked my mother: ""Did my uncle go to the store?"", to which I received a negative answer. I got tense and immediately told my mother about what happened at school. She called her brother and he immediately went to the store.  He asked if anyone had paid with a card that looked like mine (he described the appearance of my card), to which the saleswoman said ""Yes"". My mother and her friend immediately got ready and went to the store, I stayed at home. At the store they were told who exactly it was. The woman, let's call her Karen, bought alcohol, cigarettes and one loaf of bread, and then left. My mother and her friend went to sort things out with Karen, but she said that she did not take anything, and paid exclusively with her cards. It seems that she was prepared for this conversation, because she without hesitation took out of her pocket two cards from the same bank, which looked the same as mine. Understandably, my mother called the police, but there she was told the following: ""The amount is too small for us to pay such attention. Besides, you do not have proper evidence. What if your daughter gave the card herself?"" Karen and her husband also did not confess, so we had to give in. I know that their son stole my card at school.  But the problem is that I'm new at this school and I don't know what he looks like. Now let's get to the main thing - my little ""revenge plan"". I plan to find out what this little bastard thief looks like, let's call him Tim. And also find out his backpack and jacket. At my school, we leave our outerwear in the cloakroom, which anyone can enter at any time. There are no cameras either. After finding out his things, I plan to ask him to go to the toilet during class, but instead I'll head to the cloakroom. I plan to make sure that there are no teachers or technical workers nearby, and then I'll head to the cloakroom and find Tim's jacket. I'll start ruining it, tearing it, staining it with paint, maybe even cutting it with scissors. After, I'll leave the cloakroom and really head to the toilet, just to make sure that someone saw me there, and to create at least some kind of alibi for myself. After that, I'll go back to class.  If Tim's parents suddenly start to suspect me, I'll say that I have no idea what they're talking about and that they have no evidence. I can ask my friend to say that he actually saw me. Plus, the teachers will protect me because I'm a ""good girl."" Even if they call the police, they won't have any evidence against me. My parents won't believe it was me either. And even if they do, they won't punish me. Afterwards, when Tim gets a new jacket, I'll ruin it too, and I'll do it for as long as I'm in this school. That's my whole plan. I want to hear other people's opinions on this, and also hear corrections to the plan. Or just tell me what I should do. If Tim were older, I'd just beat him up, but there's a six or five year difference between us. Either way, I'm not going to let this go.",1,1737393782.0,u_No-Coast-7936,0,1.0,False

We begin with Blitz waking up to his phone’s alarm. He grunts, and reaches over to shut it off. He sits up on the couch, rubs his eyes, and stares blanky across the room. He looks grossed out and tired. He then grabs his newly obtained grimoire and opens it up.

We hear Loona open her bedroom door. She walks left to the bathroom, presumably to get ready for work. She stops at the door and looks at Blitz, with a bit of curiosity.

Loona: “What’s that book?”

Blitz: “This is… something that a guy named Stolas gave to me. It’s… how we get up to Earth.”

Loona: “Oh… cool..? I think we should get ready, yeah?”

We now cut to everyone in the IMP crew waiting on Blitz to open the door. He is at the other end of the hall, drudging his way to them. Loona is seen holding the Grimoire, skipping through the pages.

Moxxie: “Sir, are you alright? You look incredibly unwell.”

Blitz: “sssSHUT IIIIITTT…”

Moxxie shoots him quite a look. Blitz now opens the door with his keys. All members go off to their respective area. Loona sits at her Receptionist booth. Moxxie goes to the arsenal room, millie does push ups in the corner, and Blitz enters his office.

Loona, reading the Grimoire: “Okay, Blitz? Did that Stolas guy ever tell you how to use this thing?”

Blitz’s muffled voice can be heard.

Loona: “For fuck sake…” She enters Blitz’s office. “What did you say?”

Blitz: “Yuh-yuh gotta ferkin… uhh… like… Oh hand it here.”

Loona gives him the Grimoire. Blitz drinks a whole pitcher of coffee, and perks up.

“If I remember right, it’s like, you have to drag your finger to recreate the symbol.” He skimps through the pages. “Come on, this is a fancy wizard book, there should be a fireball or some shit. Found it! Hey Mox!”

Moxxie enters the room and gets ignited by a fireball. He does an invader zim screech and jumps out the window.

Blitz: “Fucking awesome!”

The phone begins ringing. Loona goes to answer it.

Loona, reading off a card: “IMP, Immense Mercenary Professionals. Are you here to schedule an appointment?”

Voice: “Uhh, yeah! Where yah place at?”

Loona: “555 South Skullshatter Street. We’re in Wrath.”

Voice: “Coal beans! I’ll be dere in a whiffy!”

The door knocks. Millie opens it. The client is already outside and is holding Moxxie by the horns.

Client: “I found dis poah homelesh feller right outshide your place. He yoah’s?”

Moxxie: “I. Am not. HOMELESS.” He wipes dirt off his face with a handkerchief.

Loona: “Go to the door right beside me, our boss will speak to you.”

Now cut to Blitz and the client sitting. The client is a large hillbilly.

Blitz “Alrighty, so what do you need us to do?”

Client: “I neecha to kill mah wahfe. She here, she a total byitch! I wuzz fuggin’ this broad, yeah? And she comes home and kills me ‘n’ her!”

Blitz: “Wait so you’re a sinner and you definitely cheated on someone, that means you should be getting tortured and up on a different layer, how’d you get here?”

Wee see a montage with the client narrating it. Sinners can find a way to please the higher ups on their ring to get a temporary suspension from their punishment. Then, they can get a passport from them to travel to other rings using the Hellevator.

Blitz: “Oh shit I forgot, that dumb big elevator. Anyway, give us your wife’s place and we’ll go kill her!”

We now see Blitz and the gang grab their weapons before they use the grimoire to open a portal to earth. 

They step through the portal and look around at a peaceful looking farmhouse. They hide behind a large fence and look into the house through a window. They see a rather peaceful looking family eating dinner. 

Blitz: “Damn, kill your husband and then get a new one?”

Moxxie: “Sir, I hate to interrupt, but this may not be the correct house!”

Millie: “What’cha mean, sweetie?”

Moxxie: “This doesn’t look like a person who would slaughter their husband? This seems like a peaceful farmer life! I shall look for clues, it’s impossible for this to be them!”

Blitz: “Okay so do you know how strong these human things are? Even the kids look like they could rip us in half.”

Millie: “Not as tough as me!” She vaults over the fence and runs up to the house. Blitz snatched her by the hair and yanks her back. 

Blitz: “The fuck are you doing, you maniac?!”

Husband: “Martha, the hell was dat noise?”

Wife: “Don’t know, think someone’s out there?”

Husband: “Well if it’s a someone, make ‘em into dinner!” The whole family pulls out shotguns.

Blitz: “FUCK IT, RUN!!!”

I just got my period today. The past few days, I’ve felt some afternoon fatigue, but overall, I’ve managed to function normally and pull my weight around the house with a few adjustments—like cutting back on cleaning time (I usually clean for about an hour a day, but I’ve only been doing 15–30 minutes lately). 

This morning, though, I woke up feeling completely bogged down—achy, heavy, and just so tired. I decided to let myself rest and stay in bed for a bit. My partner brought me breakfast and coffee in bed, which was really sweet. I got up around 11, still feeling drained, but I planned to focus on “sitting down work” for the day so I could still be productive while giving my body the rest it needed. I was hoping my partner could help with some of the more physically demanding tasks, like walking the dogs.

When he asked me to take the dogs out, I suggested that I cook instead since I could sit while chopping veggies and prepping food. But he wasn’t okay with that. He said I was using my fatigue as an excuse and implied that I do this often. He didn’t see the difference between walking the dogs and cooking, and he said it was “convenient” that I could manage one but not the other. 

For context, he’s walked the dogs more this week because he’s been working from home, while I commute about an hour each way. By the time I get home, he’s usually already walked them—not that I haven’t walked them at all, but he’s done it more lately.

What upset me the most was the idea that he thinks I use my monthly fatigue as a way to avoid things I don’t want to do. It’s so frustrating because:  
1. I don’t choose to feel this way—it’s something I have to deal with.  
2. It significantly impacts my quality of life, and I already feel guilty for asking for what I need.  

Adding to that, he said that even when he’s sick, he doesn’t stay in bed until 11 or slack off on house chores. That really hurt because I believe people have the right to care for themselves however they need when they’re not feeling well. I don’t judge others for how productive they are when they’re unwell, and I don’t think anyone has the right to do that to me.  

I didn’t ask to have PMDD or to feel fatigued every month. And what made it worse was that he implied I *always* do this. That’s simply not true—this past luteal phase, I went out of my way to stay on top of everything and make sure he had help. So to be shamed for asking for one day of rest felt really unfair. I even offered to help in a way that felt manageable for me, but apparently, that wasn’t good enough. He’s the one who gets to decide what “real” help looks like, even though he’s healthy and I’m not. He gets to decide what enough rest looks like for me, and I don’t.

It feels like part of him wants to understand, but another part of him believes that everyone should always be productive, no matter how they feel. And he’s imposing those beliefs on me.  

I just needed to vent and see what y’all think. I’m upset, and I don’t feel like he truly gets it. When I tried to explain why his comments hurt me, he either denied what he said or doubled down, which only made me rage (I admit I shouldn’t have let myself rage—I should’ve stepped away and journaled, which I guess I’m doing now, just very publicly).

I started going back to the gym in September after taking about 8 years off. From what I understand, muscle regenerates faster the second time around, and that seems to be my experience. I’m currently doing “bro lifts” (one muscle group per day) and finishing off each workout with 15 minutes on the stair climber, or 30 minutes on weekends. I usually go 5-6 days a week.

My current meal plan:
Morning (post-gym, around 6:30 AM): A protein shake with milk, a cup of orange juice, and 3 eggs with cheese and hot sauce.

Work (lunch): 2 Triple Zero Greek yogurts, a Chomps stick, and an RX bar. Sometimes I add a powdered bone broth packet.

Drinks: I drink black coffee (maybe too much) and water.

Dinner: A cup of orange juice, along with whatever my wife prepares for dinner. Meals are homemade and as organic as possible, with no seed oils or soy. Some typical meals include chicken soup, shrimp and rice, tacos (no shell for me), or 3 eggs again. We have a rotation of about 10 meals currently and they change from time to time, this can depend on the season. 

I’m mostly gluten-free—no bread, gluten, or alcohol. Occasionally, I might indulge (like on weekends when everyone’s eating pizza), but I’ve now cut it out completely because I’m determined to see results.

Even though I’m not eating until I’m stuffed, I’ve started limiting myself to one plate or bowl and reducing my portion sizes overall.

I’m getting at least 100 grams of protein a day, probably averaging 1,400-1,600 calories.

My only thought as to why I’m not losing a pound a week is that I might be regaining muscle faster, so while my weight is staying at 180 lbs, I do feel slimmer and my lifts are improving at the gym (I track those as well).

Based on the information above, does anyone have any suggestions on what to change, add, or remove to hopefully see better weight loss results?",3,1737393300.0,WeightLossAdvice,6,1.0,False

I’ve been an espresso drinker for years and currently use a bean-to-cup machine, which I’ve generally enjoyed. However, lately, I’ve been a bit concerned about potential mold issues associated with these machines.

I’ve always admired pour-over coffee and the ritual that comes with it, but I’ve never really dabbled in it—until now. I’m ready to give it a go! That said, I do have a confession: while I love the idea of the hands-on ritual, I can also be a bit lazy sometimes. 😅

This is why I’m torn between two setups:

1. **Classic pour-over setup**:
   * Fellow Stagg EKG kettle
   * Fellow Opus grinder
   * Hario V60
2. **xBloom**: The idea of a bean-to-cup solution specifically designed for pour-over is super appealing. It seems like a perfect mix of convenience and craft, but I’m curious if it lives up to the promise.

For context:

* I typically drink black coffee and appreciate a good balance of sweetness, clarity, and acidity in my cup.
* I enjoy learning new techniques but also don’t want to add unnecessary complexity to my mornings.
* I don’t mind investing in good equipment, but I want something that feels worth the cost and delivers consistently great results.

What do you all think? Is the xBloom a worthy investment for someone starting with pour-over, or should I dive straight into the classic setup? I’d love to hear your thoughts, experiences, or even alternative suggestions.

From calculators and my watch data my tdee, including 35 mins of light cardio a day is 2200. BMR 1500. I'm fairly sedentary.

I'm doing 20/4 IF as it's the only thing that has ever worked for me. Once I reach my goal I plan to continue with a relaxed 16/8.

I aim to eat a meal of 1200, I'm sometimes a little over or under. Roughly a 1000 calorie deficit.  

Both my proteins and fats are around 50-60g. Protein is double what I would usually eat If I wasn't doing 20/4 but it helps keep me full. My carbs are around 130g. I weigh and log everything, Ive learnt my lesson about oils and condiments and that bite of the toddlers left over sandwich.

Im not really interested in keto but I'd do lower carb if it would benefit me. 

I'm happy with the way things are going right now but just wanted to ask people more experienced and knowledgeable whether I was missing any tweaks? 

I also want to start some light strength training soon but I don't want to go hard on that until I reach 150, or should I do it now? I seem to fall of the wagon when I've introduced hard workouts in the past. My main priority is weight loss right now. 

The reason I do 20/4 is that once I start eating for the day I don't stop picking until I'm stuffed. So waiting until 2pm and being full after a post workout snack and big meal works for me. 

I drink 1-2 white coffees in the morning and then just water.

We don't know HuaHin, we have been in chiangmai, chiangrai, Bangkok, phuket town, kata, patong, without car, without pram, for 3 months. Has HuaHin pavements/walking paths? Here in UK and in Spain we are use to walk in our daily basis, to do groceries shopping, have a coffee, etc. I understand if you are on a villa, that would be in the middle of nowhere (for the price) However, once you Drive to the city, can you walk and push a pram or is that only reseverd for the mall?

Many thanks.

I have a Mignon Specialita and a ECM Mechanica VI Slim. Grinder is used, machine is not.

I disassembled the grinder, cleaned it, and shimed the burrs. I set 0 by listening to when the burrs chirp. 

I ground at a little over 0. This was way to course and I got almost a full shot during the pre infusion. I have tried grinding finer while the machine is running, to about -30 from my set 0. I know the numbers don't matter, they are just for reference. If I try and start the grinder at this -30, the burrs won't spin. I assume because they are to close and are wedged together.
I adjusted the burrs until they would start spinning again, about -22, and pulled a dose at that. Takes about 6.5 seconds to get an 18g dose. 

Grind dose, level, tamp. 3 second pre infusion and I already am getting about 10grams of coffee. Machine pauses. After about 20 seconds of pulling a shot, I am at 160g of espresso. Never going above about 6.25 bars. 

I have tried tamping harder, not tamping as much. Higher dose, lower dose.

So... this might be a long one but here I go! I'm looking to buy my first ""true"" espresso grinder to go with my bambino Plus. I'm in the EU, Netherlands and I've been looking to upgrade my espresso grinder which is currently my hand grinder that I bought for filter (Timemore C2). I'm by no means a pro or very advanced in espresso making but I do believe I've reached the point where I feel limited by my trusty C2 in making better espresso.

After a lot of reading and youtube I feel the best options are probably a DF64 and the Eureka oro single dose. I'm open to suggestions but for now I believe (or hope) that both will be solid options that will elevate my espresso and my own skills and last me a long time.

This brings me to pro's and cons I have in regards to both. Both I believe will make tasty espresso so I dont really mention that in the list.

**DF64 pro's:**

* Price (about €150 cheaper than the Eureka)
* Burr options/choice (Which I dont know if I should care about in the future? Because currently it means nothing to me)
* Intuitive dial to switch to filter
* Seems easy to take apart and clean (source: youtube videos)

**DF64 cons:**

* Producer outside of EU i.e. more of a hassle in customer support(?)
* Not my favorite look
* Mixed reviews/stories online which make me hesitant.
* I've read that the burrs are possibly not correctly aligned when you receive them? How? And I dont know how to align them (yet)
* Will a 54mm catch-cup fit in the holder?

**Eureka pro's:**

* Buyable in a physical store near me
* Great producer track-record
* Easthethics match kitchen colors
* Easy catch-cup placing/taking

**Eureka cons:**

* Limited burr options (again, no idea if I will care about that in the future)
* Dial can become confusing on your grind setting after some switching. (I'm currently planning on keeping the C2 for filter coffee so I dont think I will use this grinder for anything other than espresso)

I believe that's it. Any and all feedback or ideas are greatly appreciated. My biggest unkown is the burr options. Will I come to a point where the limited burr options become frustrating to me in the Eureka?

Vehicle wouldn't start of course so no warming up with coffee at my coffee stop.  All my water froze...attempted to melt some but it takes forever.  So instead I went in the nearby store to buy water.  My fingers and toes were frozen by the time I got in the store to get the water.  Less than a block. 🥶  Was able to warm up slightly before facing the bitter cold again.

Problem solved?  Not quite.  I then find I forgot to dump the grounds...so had to dethaw them carefully to dump them and add new grounds.  Now the coffee is finally brewing...but I have a chunk of ice at the bottom of my insulated coffee cup...so it's sitting near the coffee that's brewing in hopes it'll get warm enough to thaw out just enough to loosen the ice chunk so I can fill it with the coffee once it's brewed.  Hopefully within 20 more minutes I'll finally be able to warm up with some coffee.

Tomorrow it's supposed to get into the teens to mid twenties at least.  My water will likely be frozen all week.  But hopefully it'll at least be warm enough for the vehicle to start which will enable me to get fresh water until it warms up.  That is the hope any way!

Currently-6° Won't be able to even start vehicle until around 3pm and sun sets approximately 4:30ish so I'm likely stuck till tomorrow sometime.  Making something for dinner is likely goingvto be an adventure as well since everything is pretty froze.

The doxy didn’t work,
I went back to my gynecologist which gave me another 1.5g of azithromycin.

Next time I went to the gynecologist I told them I wanted to do dual treatment and do 2 weeks minocycline and 1.5 g azithromycin, because of my Tet M resistance. They didn’t send me mino and they sent me doxy, and ofc I thought this wouldn’t work, I went and picked up my prescription and spoke to the lady at the counter who used to be in infective disease, she said I should take what I had. I went to urgent care anyways to get my hands on clarithromycin which they wouldn’t give me since I already had my hands on doxy and azithromycin. So at this point when I went home I was bawling my eyes out because, because keep in mind I also had strep B and bv and some other co-infection, and my test results were showing Tet M which I knew was for ureaplasma, and macrolide resistance (didn’t know which this was for). I’m a very religious person, I prayed and prayed and prayed it would work because I couldn’t take the emotional pain anymore. I didn’t want to have to take a flouroquinolones and I didn’t want to have to get my hands on things like lefamulin or omadacycline  which was very expensive, after finishing my meds and some amoxicillin for my strep b I went back and tested and they called me and said “guess what, everything is gone, all you have is BV” 
I started crying and then a month later I went and tested my bf with an NAA dirty catch urine test, he tested negative as well (my bf had take just 1.5g of azithromycin months ago and somehow it worked for him and not me)

\---------------------------------------------------------

That morning Lucas stood in line at the coffee shop, trying to rub the sleep from his eyes. The hum of conversation filled the small space, blending with the hiss of steaming milk and the occasional clatter of a ceramic mug. He’d woken up late, his dreams—no, nightmares— were still clinging to him like a second skin. As much as he tried to shake the feeling, the images of endless spiraling cities and impossible shapes refused to leave.

“Next,” the barista called, pulling him out of his thoughts.

“Large black coffee, please,” Lucas said, digging in his pocket for cash. The barista nodded, sliding a paper cup under the drip machine. As Lucas waited, he scanned the shop, his gaze landing on a small TV mounted in the corner. A news anchor’s voice crackled faintly through the low-quality speakers.

“...several neighborhoods reporting power outages over the past 48 hours,” the anchor said. The screen cut to shaky footage of darkened streets, traffic lights flashing uselessly in the distance. “Officials have yet to determine the cause, though ComEd has ruled out grid overload. The outages coincide with reports of strange animal behavior, including—”

“Here you go,” the barista said, interrupting. Lucas took the cup with a nod of thanks, glancing once more at the screen. The broadcast had switched to an image of a park littered with dead birds. Their bodies were scattered haphazardly, wings splayed at unnatural angles. Something about how they were arranged made his stomach tighten.

Shaking his head, he stepped outside into the crisp morning air. The city buzzed with its usual energy—commuters rushing to work, horns blaring in frustration, and the faint scent of exhaust mingling with the promise of an early spring. Lucas sipped his coffee, trying to focus on the mundane rhythm of life around him. But as he walked to the campus, something felt… off.

At first, he couldn’t put his finger on it. The buildings lining the street seemed ordinary enough, their facades weathered but familiar. Yet, as he crossed an intersection, he caught a glimpse of something out of place: a faint shimmer in the reflection of a storefront window. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, like the surface of the glass had a thin layer of film over it. He stopped, staring at the window, but the shimmer was gone.

“Get a grip, Lucas,” he muttered to himself. He took another sip of coffee and kept walking.

By the time he reached campus, that nagging feeling had only grown stronger. The sidewalks were pockmarked with a multitude of new cracks, their jagged lines forming branching patterns that reminded him unsettlingly of blood vessels. He paused outside the biology building, crouching to examine one of the cracks. It was shallow, just a fracture in the concrete, but the way it spread was unnervingly determined—like it was extending its reach towards the building.

“Lucas?”

He looked up to see his graduate assistant, Tessa Ramos, standing a few feet away. Her dark hair was pulled into a loose bun, and she held a stack of papers under one arm.

“You okay?” she asked, tilting her head.

“Yeah, just…” He gestured to the crack. “Does this look weird to you?”

Tessa glanced down, frowning slightly. “It’s just a crack.”

“Sure,” Lucas said, standing and brushing his hands on his jeans. “Just a crack.”

They walked into the building together, Tessa launching into an update on her latest project—a comparative study of freshwater algae. Lucas tried to focus, nodding at the appropriate moments, but his thoughts kept drifting. The shimmer in the window, the cracks in the sidewalk, the dead birds on the news—it all swirled in his mind, a kaleidoscope of stress.

Later that afternoon, Lucas sat in his office, staring at his computer screen. The papers he was supposed to be grading sat untouched on his desk, the red pen he’d grabbed hours ago still capped. He scrolled through a local news website, skimming headlines.

**“Unexplained Blackouts Baffle Officials”**

**“Residents Report Strange Animal Behavior”**

**“Dead Birds Found in Unprecedented Numbers”**

The articles offered little explanation, just speculation: aging infrastructure, environmental pollution, seasonal migration patterns. None of it felt right. Lucas leaned back in his chair, rubbing his temples. He couldn’t shake the feeling that these incidents were connected—not just to each other, but to the samples he and Evelyn had collected from the lake.

A knock at the door broke his train of thought.

“Come in,” he called.

Tessa stepped inside, a concerned look on her face. “Have you seen this?” She held up her phone, the screen displaying a video.

“What is it?” Lucas asked, motioning for her to sit.

She handed him the phone. The video was shaky, shot by someone standing on a city sidewalk. It showed a group of rats gathered in the corner of an alley. At first glance, it seemed like normal behavior, but as the camera zoomed in, Lucas’s chest tightened. The rats weren’t milling about randomly; they were arranged in a perfect geometric circle, their bodies motionless, noses pointed inward.

“That’s… not normal,” Lucas said, handing the phone back.

“No kidding,” Tessa said. “The guy who posted this said it’s been happening all over the city. And it’s not just rats. Pigeons, crows… even squirrels.”

Lucas leaned forward, his fingers steepled under his unshaven chin. “How long has this been going on?”

“A couple of days, I think. It started around the same time as the blackouts.”

He nodded slowly, his mind racing. “What about Evelyn? Have you heard from her?”

“Not since last night,” Tessa said. “She texted me about holding off on collecting algae samples at the lake but nothing after that.”

Evelyn had a tendency to go dark when she was deep into her work, but given everything that was happening, her silence wasn’t well received. “All right,” he said, standing. “Let’s head to the lab and check in on her.”

The walk across campus to Evelyn’s lab was brisk, the chill of the early spring air cutting through the thin sunlight. Tessa walked a step behind Lucas, her hand shoved into the pockets of her jacket. Her phone screen glowed faintly as she replayed the video of the rats for the fifth time, her brow furrowed.

“Do you think Evelyn’s seen this yet?” she asked.

“I doubt it,” Lucas said. “She’s been busy with her research. But even if she has, I don't know what she’ll make of an online video. She’s not exactly the conspiracy-theory type.”

“Neither are you,” Tessa said, glancing up. “But you can’t tell me this isn’t weird.”

Lucas sighed, his breath misting in the cool air. “It’s weird. But we’re at a point where things are either connected or just coincidences. And, personally, I'm hoping for all of this to be the latter. People tend to see patterns where they want them.”

“Patterns like geometric circles made of rats?” Tessa muttered, earning a sharp glance from Lucas.

They entered the biology building, the door creaking faintly as they stepped into the clinical, fluorescent-lit corridor. Lab 3C sat at the far end of the hallway, its frosted glass door bearing Evelyn’s name in faded black letters.

The pair walked up together. Lucas stood outside Evelyn’s lab, his fist poised to knock, but his eyes landed on the edges of the door. The entrance, usually closed tight, was slightly ajar, a sliver of sterile light spilling out into the dim corridor. 

He glanced at Tessa, who had stood next to him with her usual agreeable demeanor. Though her expression was a mixture of curiosity and concern, she tried to mask it by clutching her notebook tighter against her chest.

“You sure she’s here?” Tessa asked, keeping her voice low.

“She’s always here,” Lucas replied. He pushed the door open without knocking.

Inside, the lab was as cluttered as ever. Equipment crowded every surface—centrifuges, microscopes, racks of vials, and a scattering of papers covered in Evelyn’s sharp, impatient handwriting. Evelyn was hunched over a workstation, her face partially obscured by the glare of her monitor.

“Evelyn?” Lucas called.

She didn’t look up immediately, her fingers darting across her keyboard as if finishing a thought. “You took your time,” she said finally, her voice clipped. She glanced up, her eyes bloodshot and shadowed. “And you brought company.”

“You could’ve called if you wanted us to show up sooner,” Lucas replied. “What’s going on?”

Evelyn gestured to a monitor on her desk. “Look over here. This,” Evelyn said, her voice curt, “is the updated spread of the anomalies over the past seventy-two hours. It’s not random. It’s radiating outwards from the lake. And those samples we took yesterday show a major increase in those new cell structures.”

Lucas leaned over her shoulder, squinting at the screen. It displayed a map of Chicago and its surrounding areas, overlaid with red dots clustered around the lakefront and spreading inland in edged lines.

“So, these are the sample sites we went to,” Evelyn said, pointing to the lake. “And these—” she indicated towards the inland dots, “—are locations where we’re starting to see anomalies. Increased alkalinity, unexplained organism activity, even small-scale tremors.”

“Wait,” Tessa said, stepping closer. “So these really are all connected?”

“That’s the question,” Evelyn said. “I’ve been analyzing reports for the last few days. Whatever’s happening, it’s not isolated to the lake anymore. It’s moving.”

Lucas frowned, leaning in closer. “Moving how?”

Evelyn pulled up another screen, this one showing a time-lapse overlay of the map. The red dots spread slowly but steadily, inching their way inland like spilled ink. “The anomalies are progressing in a distinct pattern. Like I said, it’s not random.”

Lucas rubbed his temples, his mind racing. “So what are you saying? There’s some kind of living network spreading through the city?”

Evelyn hesitated, then nodded. “That’s one possibility.”

“That’s not a possibility,” Lucas said, his voice sharp. “You’re talking about a biological system that spans miles, growing through urban infrastructure in record time. That’s not how viable life works.”

“Not life as we know it,” Evelyn shot back. “But you saw the cells, Lucas. You saw how they move, how they adapt. Whatever this is, it doesn’t follow the rules we’re used to.”

Lucas straightened, crossing his arms. “It sounds like nonsense.”

“So did thermophiles a century ago,” Evelyn snapped. “Or extremophiles surviving in vacuums. You should know that more than anyone. Just because this doesn’t fit our framework doesn’t mean it’s not occurring.” Evelyn gestured toward the monitor.

Lucas folded his arms tighter, his gaze fixed on the heat map. He wanted to dismiss it all as paranoia, as Evelyn jumping to conclusions out of exhaustion or desperation. But the patterns were hard to ignore, and the tightness in his gut was growing harder to suppress.

“Fine,” he said finally. “Let’s say this thing is spreading. What’s its endgame? What does it want?”

Evelyn didn’t answer immediately. She looked at the map, her expression unreadable. “Maybe it doesn’t want anything. Maybe it’s just… expanding.”

“Like a mycelium,” Tessa said quietly. “A city wide mycelium.”

Lucas frowned, turning to her. “You think this thing is growing like a fungal colony?”

“I’m just saying it might be a possible explanation,” Tessa said, her voice hesitant. “But if it’s spreading and adapting in the city, then it’s not just reacting to an opening in the ecosystem. It’s making one. Maybe that’s its way of surviving.”

Lucas stared at her, unsure whether to be impressed or unnerved by the suggestion. “That’s not a bad suggestion. But it’s a big leap.”

“I don’t think it’s a leap at all,” Evelyn said, her conviction returning. “It’s acting with a purpose, Lucas. We just don’t understand what that purpose is yet. What we do know is that it wants to expand.""

He pursed his lips into a thin line, running a hand through his hair. “Alright. Let’s keep an eye on it. But until we have concrete evidence, I’m not ready to jump on the ‘sentient mycorrhizal network’ bandwagon.”

Evelyn nodded, though her expression suggested she wasn’t entirely pleased.

Lucas sighed, “I think we need to start with the animals,” He leaned against the counter, his fingers unconsciously digging into the fabric of his sleeves. “If we can figure out how they’re being affected—rats, birds, anything—it might give us a better idea of what this… thing is doing.”

Tessa stood across from him, arms crossed tightly, her brow furrowed. “You want to go out there? Like, into the city?”

“We don’t have much choice,” Lucas replied. “You're both convinced this is bigger than we think, and to be fair, neither of you are wrong—it does look like it's spreading. If we wait too long, whatever’s causing this might get worse.”

Tessa exhaled sharply. “Okay, I'm in. But we’re not exactly set up for fieldwork, are we? Do we even have the right equipment for this?”

Lucas nodded toward a corner of the lab where a battered duffel bag sat. “We always have some basic go bags ready. Gloves, specimen containers, a net, even a thermal scanner. It’s not perfect, but it’ll do.”

Tessa glanced at the bag and then back at Lucas. “This feels… I don’t know. Impulsive.”

“It is,” Evelyn said, cutting in. “But welcome to field research. Just bring me back something interesting to look at.”

\---

The Loop was alive in the way only a big city could be—thick with the hum of human activity. Buses groaned as they pulled into stops, car horns blared in discordant frustration, and the overlapping murmur of voices mixed with the occasional wail of a siren in the distance. The sidewalks were crowded with pedestrians, most of them clutching coffee cups or their phones, heads bent as they hurried through the gray afternoon. Overhead, the L rumbled along its elevated tracks, the metallic clatter echoing between the tall buildings.

Lucas adjusted the strap of the duffel bag that was slung over his shoulder. “This part of the city’s always busy,” he said, glancing at Tessa as they weaved through the crowd. “Whatever’s going on, it hasn’t scared people off yet.”

“Yet,” Tessa muttered, hugging a small backpack to her chest. She glanced nervously at the sky, where a blanket of low-hanging clouds churned, threatening rain. “Are we sure this is the best place to start? The Loop doesn’t exactly seem like anything's ‘natural habitat.’”

Lucas gestured towards the narrow alleys that split off from the main streets, their mouths dark and uninviting. “Animals adapt. Rats, birds—they thrive anywhere. And in busy places like these, they won't be scared of us. Easier to catch. Besides, the anomalies Evelyn mapped out suggest this area’s been hit the hardest.”

They reached the entrance to an alley, its walls lined with decades of grime and the thick lines of graffiti tags that stretched toward the fire escapes above. A faint smell of rot mixed with the scent of asphalt, carried by the damp air. Lucas hesitated before stepping inside, pulling a flashlight from the duffel.

“You good?” he asked, looking back at Tessa.

She swallowed but nodded, clutching her phone like a good luck charm. “Yeah. Just… don’t lose me.”

The alley was narrow and felt unnaturally still compared to the bustling street they’d just left. Lucas scanned the ground with his flashlight, the beam cutting through the dimness to reveal scraps of paper, broken bottles, and scattered debris. A faint skittering sound echoed from further in, causing Tessa to stop abruptly.

“Rats,” Lucas said, his voice low. “Let’s see if we can catch one.”

He set the duffel down, pulling out a collapsible net and a small cage. As he moved toward the sound, Tessa stayed close, her eyes darting nervously between the shadows. The air here was colder, heavier, as if the narrow space held a weight of its own. The skittering grew louder, followed by the soft, rhythmic tap of tiny claws on metal.

“There,” Tessa whispered, pointing to a dumpster near the back of the alley. Its lid was slightly ajar, and something inside shifted, the faint sound of rustling garbage carrying through the silence.

Lucas nodded, positioning himself near the dumpster as he unfolded the net. “Stay back,” he murmured. “I’ll lift the lid.”

Tessa took a step back, her phone flashlight trained on the container. Lucas gripped the edge of the lid and pushed it upward with deliberate care, the hinges creaking loudly in the stillness. The stench of rot and decay wafted out, causing both of them to recoil slightly.

Inside, the pile of garbage moved. A cluster of rats—at least a dozen—scattered at the sudden intrusion, their slick, dark bodies darting in all directions. But one didn’t move. It sat in the center of the pile, its body unnaturally still, its beady eyes fixed on Lucas. The rat’s fur was patchy, and its skin bulged in places, the surface crawling with tiny, pulsing veins that throbbed faintly under the flashlight’s beam. Little spirals of flesh grooved their way into its skin.

“Jesus,” Tessa breathed, her voice trembling. “What the hell is wrong with it?”

Lucas didn’t answer immediately. He reached into the dumpster with the net, careful not to make any sudden movements. The rat didn’t flinch, didn’t react as the net closed around it. When Lucas lifted it out, the animal hung limply, its breathing shallow but steady.

“It’s alive,” he said quietly, lowering it into the cage. “But just barely by the looks of it.”

Tessa moved closer, peering at the rat through the bars of the cage. “That throbbing… it’s under its skin. It’s like something’s inside it.”

Lucas nodded grimly. “We’ll analyze it back at the lab. It might have worms.”

A sudden noise behind them—a metallic clatter—made both of them jump. Lucas spun around, his flashlight slicing through the darkness. At the far end of the alley, the shadows seemed to shift, something large and hunched moving just beyond the edge of the light.

“Did you see that?” Tessa whispered, her voice nearly inaudible.

Lucas didn’t answer. He stepped forward, the beam of his flashlight sweeping the alley. The figure disappeared, melting into the shadows as if it had never been there. Lucas’s pulse quickened, his grip tightening on the flashlight.

“We should go,” Tessa said, her voice shaking. “Lucas, whatever that was—”

The noise came again, this time closer. A wet, squelching sound, followed by the faint scrape of claws against brick. Lucas turned, his light catching a glimpse of something slithering across the ground. It was large, the size of a dog, its body a tangle of muscle and bone that didn’t fit any recognizable form. Patches of its flesh ungulated faintly, independently of its movement. It was the same throbbing gesticulations that pulsed beneath the rat’s skin on an incomprehensible scale.

“Move,” Lucas said sharply, grabbing the cage and the duffel. He backed his way toward the street, the sound of heavy, uneven footsteps echoing in front of him as the thing staggered towards the dumpster.

Tessa was right by his side, her breath coming in slow wisps. Once the shape had moved behind the dumpster, they ran. They burst out of the alley and back onto the crowded sidewalk, the city’s noise swallowing the sounds of their hearts. Lucas glanced back. The alley was empty.

“Lucas,” Tessa said, clutching his arm. “What the hell was that?”

“I don’t know,” he admitted, his voice quiet. He looked down at the cage in his hand, the rat inside twitching faintly. “But we’re taking this back to the lab. Now. I think you and Evenlyn are right about this.”",15,1737392742.0,StrangeAccounts,0,1.0,False

The Kingdom Of Haiti & The Southern Republic Of Haiti Explained,"So After Dessalines was Killed by the Mulattos, There was a Power Struggle between The Blacks and Mulattos for Control of the Island. Leading for The Blacks was Henri Christophe and for the Mulattos was Alexander Petion.

[The 2 Countries](https://preview.redd.it/g9d8297sv3ee1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8416b718b27c99318256d4bf7978c907843c8e47)

I am going to start with Christophe and explain how he got in power. Henry Christophe learned everything he knew from experience.  A Negro born into a slave family on the island of Grenada, he never went to school and was illiterate his whole life.  His life’s purpose was to eradicate slavery and build Haiti into a strong country, and the slave boy who would be king took seriously the power and perks that came with the job.

Christophe was a rambunctious kid.  At age seven the plantation owner turned his unchanneled energy into profit when he sold the boy to a Negro mason as an apprentice.  Christophe ran away from his master and stowed away on a boat bound for the island of Saint Domingue (now Haiti).  At age twelve, Christophe ended up the servant of a French naval officer, hired to oil his boots and serve his meals.  This job took him north to America where Christophe fought with the French in the Siege of Savannah before returning to Haiti where he was again sold to a free Negro who owned a hotel.  The ambitious young man moved up from stable boy to cook, waiter and billiard marker.  He saved enough money to buy his freedom.

When Christophe was 26 years old he married the boss’s daughter, Marie Louise, who was only 15.  They had two sons and two daughters.

After the Death of Dessalines his generals marched on the capital, abolished the Empire and drove out the imperial family, which had to go into exile. Alexandre Pétion proclaims the Republic and becomes president. But another general, Henri Christophe, seceded and took control of northern Haiti where he established a separatist government  the Northern State.

[The State Of Haiti](https://preview.redd.it/bg6sdg7nd2ee1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aa506b7200049c7511258b35f9d9463cdcb73d6)

President of the Northern Republic then president and generalissimo  of the land and sea forces of the State of Northern Haiti from 1807—Henri Christophe wanted to legitimize his power as Dessalines had done by re-establishing the empire. In conflict with the southern republic of Pétion, he managed, after several battles, to secure the borders of his new state. Having established a certain stability, Christophe established a constitutional monarchy with him as monarch. He became King of Haiti on 28 March 1811, under the name of Henri I. On 2 June 1811, he was crowned by the Grand Archbishop Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Brelle.

[Christophe Becoming King](https://preview.redd.it/0zicartpm6ee1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=166604033f935c8b5aa39148a08de473c26aab59)

In March 1811, President Henry Christophe surprised everyone when he anointed himself King Henry I and renamed the northern republic, the Kingdom of Hayti. Henry I soon had a full court of nobles that included dukes, barons, counts and knights to rival that of royal England. Haiti’s first and only kingdom immediately attracted the attention of media outlets from around the world. How could there be a republic on one side of the island and a monarchy on the other, they wondered?  Was the new Black king trying to mimic the same white sovereigns who had once enslaved his people, others asked? The edicts establishing the royal order of Haiti were immediately translated into English and printed in Philadelphia, while many American and British newspapers and magazines ran celebrity profiles of the Haitian king. One Newspaper described him as “the elegant model of an Hercules.” Another Described him as “a remarkably handsome, well-built man; with a broad chest, square shoulders, and an appearance of great muscular strength and activity.”

[Henri Christophe](https://preview.redd.it/wt0y2pgvm6ee1.jpg?width=220&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=feb2d09518b5da3dafa912bf802a547f9989ebc1)

On March 28, 1811, King Henry installed a constitutional monarchy, a move lauded by many in the British elite. The famous British naturalist Joseph Banks championed Henry’s 1812 book of laws, titled the “Code Henry,” calling it “the most moral association of men in existence.” “Nothing that white men have been able to arrange is equal to it,” he added. Banks admired the code’s detailed reorganization of the economy, from one based on slave labor to one – at least in theory – based on free labor. This transformation was wholly fitting for the formerly enslaved man-turned-king, whose motto was “I am reborn from my ashes. ”The code provided for shared compensation between proprietors and laborers at “a full fourth the gross product, free from all duties,” and it also contained provisions for the redistribution of land that had previously belonged to slave owners.“ Your Majesty, in his paternal solicitude,” one edict reads, “wants for every Haytian, indiscriminately, the poor as well as the rich, to have the ability to become the owner of the lands of our former oppressors.”

[Flag Of The Kingdom Of Haiti](https://preview.redd.it/lijzp9qiw3ee1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7d6cc1bc8b1a910942e660a5881a6cd9eb73808)

Henry’s stated “paternal solicitude” even extended to enslaved Africans. While the Constitution of 1807  had announced that Haiti would not “disturb the regimes” of the colonial powers, royal Haitian guards regularly intervened in the slave trade to free captives on foreign ships that entered Haitian waters. An October 1817 issue of the Gazette celebrated the Haitian military’s capture of a slave ship and subsequent release of 145 of “our unfortunate brothers, victims of greed and the odious traffic in human flesh.”

In 1813, construction of the opulent Sans-Souci Palace meaning literally “without worry” – was completed. The palace was partially destroyed by an earthquake in 1842; today, its remains have been designated a world heritage UNESCO site.

[The Palace pre Earthquake](https://preview.redd.it/y9bnktnwu2ee1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a123bb67f6cc134cef59b24c7b41c59a3a505223)

King Henry lived in the palace with his wife, Queen Marie-Louise , and his three children, Prince Victor Henry, and the princesses, Améthyste and Athénaire.

On June 28, 1814, not three months after the long since beheaded Louis XVI’s brothers benefited from England’s defeat of Napoléon, which sent him into exile on the island of Elba, the Kingdom of France, led by Louis XVIII, formally opened its mission to “restore Saint-Domingue”. A former French colonist and planter from Saint-Domingue, Pierre-Victor, the Baron de Malouet, oversaw the mission. Previously dismissed by Napoléon for not supporting his incursion into Russia, Malouet was immediately rein-stated by Louis XVIII and appointed minister of the marine and colonies.  Under the imprimatur of Louis XVIII, in June 1814 Malouet sent a letter to Agoustine Franco de Médina (of Santo Domingo), Jean-François Dauxion-Lavaysse (of Gascogne), and Herman Dravermann (of Bordeaux). The missive directed the three men to travel to the Caribbean island of Jamaica, under British rule, and from there to form a plan to approach the two different rulers of Haiti. Their mission was twofold: gain entry to either part of the island — the kingdom or the republic — to gather information that might be helpful for the planned military expedition. In the process the three needed to gauge the feelings of Haiti’s two rulers vis-à-vis the return of French authority. 

[Pierre Victor, baron Malouet](https://preview.redd.it/xnj4330c13ee1.jpg?width=594&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c0236885b4aa3ba65db610821f516fae44303c2)

Malouet instructed him to go to the northern part of the island, to the Kingdom of Haiti, and try to meet Christophe. 

This might have been a reasonable plan, if Christophe’s state-run newspapers were not printing constant diatribes against France, warning both the ex-colonists and the French government, under the pain of death, to never return to the island whose people they once forced into bondage. Only three months before Médina’s arrival in Cap-Henry, the Royal Gazette of Hayti gleefully announced that the emperor of France had at last been dethroned. “The execrable Bonaparte, who vainly tried to exterminate us, has just succumbed to the united efforts of the allied powers … Europe has just broken his tyrannical yoke forever.” Although the Haitian king expressed doubt about the politics of the French king with respect to Haiti, the same number of the Gazette issued a stern warning to all of France: “If by a false and reckless policy, owing to absurd calculations, dictated by a sordid and rapacious interest, unjust aggressors once again come to defile our territory, by placing a hostile foot here; … \[i\]f our implacable enemies, the colonists, particularly, persist in their absurd and chimerical projects; if they do manage to entice the current government of France to wage an unjust, ruinous, and disastrous war against us … they will be the first to be sacrificed to our revenge …. “It is then that we will wage a war of extermination, and we will give no quarter, spare no prisoner,” the article finished.

When one of the French envoys arrived in the north, Christophe had him arrested and jailed where he was left to die.

The Kingdom Of Haiti unlike the Southern Republic was very successful, Christophe took his authority seriously and declared Catholicism as the official religion, although other beliefs would be tolerated.  He made divorce illegal, and parents were not allowed to disinherit their children.  He understood the importance of trade, and he courted the United States and Britain as trading partners, giving foreign businesses absolute protection. Haiti had no currency, so Christophe created one.  Gourds were used for bowls, utensils and bottles, making them indispensable to daily life, but they wore out.  The new president confiscated all the gourd plants.  When the farmers brought dried coffee berries to the capital, Christophe would buy them, paying in gourds.  Then he sold the coffee to other countries for gold, giving Haiti a growing, stable currency.  Even today, the term for Haiti’s money is the *gourde*.

[Haitian Gourde](https://preview.redd.it/iq4hjdrhb3ee1.jpg?width=2091&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33368c26f597720b2d957cdf3cdc89d570c9e1fd)

Under Christophe’s leadership, his colony began to thrive.  He introduced Code Henry mandating that every adult was obligated to work in the fields.  Monday through Friday they were required to work from daylight until 8:00am when they took a break for breakfast.  Then they worked from 9:00 until 12:00 when they got a two hour rest.  They resumed working at 2:00 until dusk.  Saturday was a day off from the fields to allow the workers to tend to their own land and take their goods to market.  Sunday was reserved for rest and going to church.  The plantation owners had to give one quarter of their gross profits to their workers and provide room and board and medical treatment.  An owner could not transfer a worker from one activity to another without the worker’s permission.  The military police oversaw the plantation owners to insure compliance.

The king availed himself every Thursday for a public audience when he would listen to petitions.  In the morning he received the commoners, and in the evening he received the aristocracy, who were required to wear their military uniform or formal court dress.  An answer was always given the following Thursday.

Christophe had his hands in everything.  He monopolized the meat supply and all the cattle crazed on state land.  He built seven palaces and 15 chateaux, all surrounded by fertile land which produced, among other things, two-thirds of the kingdom’s sugar export.  He sold everything for gold, increasing his personal wealth and the national treasury.  

Even though he hated the French, he knew the country needed the expertise and knowledge of white men.  He offered full citizenship to any white man who married a Haitian woman and lived in Haiti for one year.  Any white man who married a black woman anywhere in the world would be welcomed to settle in Haiti, and the government would set them up. 

The future of the kingdom was very important to the king, and Christophe created five national schools for boys modeled after Joseph Lancaster’s British and Foreign School Society.  Teachers were quickly trained for two thousand students.  English was required, and advanced students could learn Spanish.  The curriculum also included French, reading, writing, arithmetic and grammar.  During the summer, classes met from 6:00am to 11:00am and then again from 2:00 to 6:00.  The winter hours were shorter, from 7:00 in the morning until 5:00.  Thursday and Sunday were days off with the exception of attending morning prayers and a lecture.  In addition, every boy at least ten years old had to learn a trade.

Upon the recommendation of the monarch’s personal physician, Dr. Duncan Stewart, a Scottish surgeon who visited many of the commoners working on the king’s farms, it was necessary to educate girls in order to prevent voodoo from creeping back into public practice.  In 1818 Christophe issued an edict opening up education for girls but stipulating that they must be taught in schools separate from boys.  Christophe also founded a royal college for secondary education where students studied English, French, Latin, history, geography and math.

Public health was also an issue the king focused on.  He appointed Dr. Stewart as director of the hospital with responsibility for the accommodations for the sick.  In addition to food and clothing, this included a pair of stocks installed at the foot of each bed for the legs of the patient if he was disobedient or didn’t take his medication.

The British didn’t fully recognize Christophe’s authority, but that did not inhibit him from imposing it absolutely on his citizens.  Every marriage had to be a civil contract, and as the king moved around the kingdom, if he even suspected that a couple was living in sin, he forced them to marry on the spot.  The penalty for stealing was death, and those guilty of a misdemeanor were punished by flogging.  Christophe carried a silver-topped cane and used it to beat people he saw on his daily walks who he deemed were being lazy.  No one was immune from the king’s judgment.  One time he went to mass and the priest was not immediately there.  Christophe ordered soldiers to arrest him and take him directly to jail.

Being a dictatorial monarch took its toll on Christophe.  On August 15, 1820 during the mid-day break he went to mass, which was not a part of his normal routine.  Just before he was given communion, Christophe suffered a stroke which left him permanently paralyzed.  His mind was still clear and he tried to carry on business as usual, but his government was threatened by factions who hated his tyrannical ways.  In October the king tried to stand up to the rebels, but he realized he did not have the support he needed.

One Sunday evening, Christophe called his wife and children into his room to discuss the state of the state and then sent them off to bed.  After they left he raised a pistol to his chest and shot himself.  As word of the king’s death got out, looters started ransacking the palace.  Two men were able to get the body out of the residence, but they couldn’t find tools to dig a grave, so they buried Christophe in a pile of lime.  In 1847, 27 years after his death, the monarch who did great things for his country, if perhaps not in great ways, was given a proper burial in a concrete tomb at the place d’Armes at the Citadel on the peak of La Ferrière.

Following the death of his father on October 8, 1820, the Prince Royal should have been proclaimed as King Henri II of Haiti, but the country was already in turmoil and he never had a chance. Ten days later, he was murdered after being bayoneted by revolutionaries at the Sans-Souchi Palace.



Now i want to go over The Southern Republic which was led by Alexander Petion. Alexandre Pétion was born at Port-au-Prince, April 2, 1770, the son of a mulatto woman and a white man, Pascal Sabès, who, considering his son too dark of skin, refused to recognize him. His elementary education was very inadequate because the whites had not established schools in the colony of Saint Domingue. He learned the trade of silversmith from one of his father's old friends, M. Guiole, a native of Bordeaux\*\*,\*\* whose wife showed much solicitude for the young boy. She called him Pichoun, which in her southern patois meant *mon petit*, ""my little one, whence the name Pétion, by which he continued to be known and which he finally adopted as his own. 

[Alexander Petion](https://preview.redd.it/k3ac0prhj3ee1.jpg?width=639&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88dc344acb5c9bad8baa6d3f48b04db0004a96c7)

Pétion, who was military governor of the Western Province, used all of his influence to have the republican form of government adopted. He was fundamentally democratic and passionately devoted to the ideals of freedom, as he had proved in his youth. His liberalism had been strengthened during his stay in Paris by contact with men of the Revolution, who believed in the progress of democracy by the diffusion of the ideas of brotherhood. The Constituent Assembly, which met at Port-au-Prince in December, 1806, was composed mainly of his friends. It voted a constitution which took its inspiration, in its general outline, from the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, for which the Revolution of Saint Domingue had been fought. The new constitution organized the Republic with the executive power delegated to a magistrate called the President of Haiti, who was elected for four years; the legislative power resided in a Senate of eighty members; and the judicial power was in- vested, except for minor magistrates, in judges named for life. By excessive reaction from the dictatorship, powers were accorded to the legislative body which gave it definite advantages over the President. It was in pursuance of this constitution that on December 28, 1806, Henri Christophe, General-in-Chief of the army, was elected President of Haiti. Finding his powers too restricted by the republican constitution, Christophe isolated himself in the Northern Province, and on February 17, 1807, had a new constitution voted which named him president for life and generalissimo of the military and naval forces, with the right of choosing his successor from among the generals exclusively, and of designating the members of a Council of State, of which at least two thirds should be army men.

[Republic Of Haiti Flag](https://preview.redd.it/x6z42zf2x3ee1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c96ed01403d04c6220e722fc3a747f2efb06f916)

 In answer to this act, the Senate convened at Port-au-Prince, impeached Christophe, and elected on March 11\*,\* 1807, General Pétion President of the Republic of Haiti.  Elected President of the Haitian Republic in January, 1807, Pétion was re-elected in March, 1811, and again in **March**, 1815. A new constitution voted in 1816, re-affirmed the principle of the separation of powers, re-organized the legislative body to be composed of a chamber of deputies and a senate. It established the presidency for a life term and gave to the head of the State **the** right to nominate his successor to the Sen- ate, which alone was responsible for the presidential election. The establishment of the presidency for a life term was severely criticized. **An** impartial observer of Haitian life, the Englishman, Mark B. Bird, has written on this subject: ""However pure and honest the motives may have been which led to the adoption of this principle, the wisdom of such a measure causes grave doubts. A president elected for a short term would have served as a safety valve by which might have escaped the extreme agitation of those fired by the legitimate ambition to reach this coveted post of honor. One may well question the wisdom of suppressing such a hope. Also, from that moment\*\*,\*\* there was always **the** fear that revolution **might** burst forth."" As a matter of fact, the country was not lacking in men who, like Pétion, had rendered service to the cause of independence and who believed themselves as qualified as he, if **not** more so, to govern the country.  The administration of Pétion was marked by three acts of capital importance.  Andre Rigaurd also manages to escape  from jail  hiding his identity and returns to Haiti in 1810. When he gets there Petion welcomes him at first but Rigaud intended to make his own country in les cayes and seceded in 3 november 1810. He  then dies on 18 september 1811 due to yellow fever. A few months later, Petion reattaches les cayes to the South republic.

[Riguard was a mentor to Petion](https://preview.redd.it/euohvijnm3ee1.jpg?width=465&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=918e161f4db0f6d29f469e5aae3a5c859632920f)

First, the distribution of lands of the national domain to officers and soldiers of the Army **of** Independence, thus creating moderate and small rural estates. Second, the establishment at Port-au-Prince of a *lycée* for boys and a school of secondary education for girls, and the encouragement given by public education for the formation of an intellectual élite among Haitian youth. Third, the help given Simon Bolivar for the emancipation of the Spanish colonists of this hemisphere and for the abolition of slavery in South America.  The territory of the French colony of Santo Domingo had originally been divided into large domains belonging to a restricted class, that of the *grands planteurs* composed of the younger sons of the French aristocracy and of enriched colonists who with the labor of many slaves could exploit their plantations on a large scale. When Haiti proclaimed her independence, the plantations of the colonists were confiscated and became the property of the Haitian state. A few of the large estates were given to the commanding generals of the army. Alexandre Pétion had the insight of genius. He understood that the best means of developing national spirit was to attach the citizen to the soil by making him the owner of the land he cultivates. He saw also in such a measure the application of a principle of social justice. By a law in 1809\*\*,\*\* completed by another in 1814, Pétion contrived the division of the large colonial plantations and the distribution of the lots thus formed as ""national gifts"" to the lower officers and soldiers of the Army of Independence. Having thus created the small peasant farms, Alexandre Pétion could legitimately be called the founder of rural democracy in Haiti. Study of the economic organization of Haiti demonstrates the resistance which its peasant ownership of the soil and its plan of cultivating small farms was able to oppose to the world depression. It shows clearly that the agrarian problem\*\*,\*\* which is at the present moment the obsessing preoccupation of numerous American and European countries, has been solved by the black republic of the West Indies in the most democratic manner, and that by consequence Haiti is immune to communist revolution. The Haitian peasant is, in fact, highly individualistic and strongly opposed to all types of collectivism, except in the rudimentary form of cooperative work which they call *coumbite.1* Haiti is an agricultural country. Of its present population of three million inhabitants, two-thirds live in the country and cultivate the land. Three-quarters of the territory of the Republic belong with full rights of ownership to the Haitian peasants. This is the most certain safeguard of the security and stability of the state, for if Haiti has known in the past political and governmental instability, it has always had. 

On June 28, 1814,  Louis XVIII, formally opened its mission to “restore Saint-Domingue”. Just like he did with Christophe Louis sent French Ambassadors to the Southern Republic in order to get Petion to submit to French Authority. Malouet instructed Dravermann to travel to the southern republic to meet Borgella, Pétion’s second-in-command, while Dauxion-Lavaysse was meant to go with him to Port-au-Prince to appeal to Pétion. The rulers of the southern republic were to be approached first because Malouet believed that both Pétion and Borgella remained open to the prospect of French return. Médina had the most dangerous mission of them all, one that he would end up paying for with his life.

Unlike Christophe, Petion was more cooperative to negotiate with the ambassadors offering to pay for France recognizing Haiti.

[French Offer to Petion](https://reddit.com/link/1i5v14x/video/293y15xks3ee1/player)

Pétion proved that he did not desire freedom and independence for Haiti alone, but also for all those peoples who were burdened by the insufferable yoke of foreign domination. Simon Bolivar furnished him the opportunity to show his magnificent altruism in this respect. Imitating the example set by the founders of Haitian independence, the Venezuelan hero had undertaken to free his country from the domination of Spain. His first attempts failed. Accompanied by a large number of followers, he took refuge in Haiti during the last days of September, 1815. President Pétion gave him a cordial welcome and in order that he might begin again his struggle against the Spanish, he gave him money, arms, munitions, supplies and a little printing press. Some Haitians enlisted under Bolivar's flag. The latter, wishing to show his gratitude to Pétion and, as he himself expressed it in a letter of February 8, 1816, ""leave to posterity an irrevocable monument to the Haitian President's philanthropy\*\*,\*\*"" desired that his benefactor be named as ""the author of American liberty"" in all solemn acts addressed to the inhabitants of Venezuela. In his answer of February 18, Pétion declined such an honor for himself, claiming as unique recompense for his aid, the proclamation of complete freedom of slaves in all those countries of America where the arms of the Liberator triumphed. 

[Simón Bolívar](https://preview.redd.it/y4li5j22u3ee1.png?width=220&format=png&auto=webp&s=66eaafc57aa6aa12f96d9b0a30de193c518b4ac4)

The little expedition left the port of Cayes, in the south of Haiti, in April\*\*,\*\* 1816. May 31, Bolivar landed at Carupano, after a short stop at the Ile Margarita. It was not until July 3, however, that he occupied Ocumare, and July 6, feeling that the moment had come to answer in a brilliant manner the request of President Pétion, he promulgated his famous proclamation decreeing the abolition of slavery in Spanish America. ""Our unfortunate brothers,"" said he, ""who are under the bond of slavery, are from this moment declared free. The laws of nature and humanity and the government itself proclaim their liberty. Henceforth, there will be in Venezuela only one class of inhabitants: all will be citizens."" This act marks a moment of exceptional importance in the history of the world: the official recognition in Spanish America of the rights of Negroes and those of African descent as men and citizens. Haiti is justly proud of having brought this about.  In a letter of October 9, 1816, Simon Bolivar expressed an appreciation of Pétion which merits quoting: ""Your Excellency,"" wrote the Liberator,  ""possesses a quality which is above empires, namely altruism. It is the President of Haiti alone who governs for the people. It is he alone who leads his equals. The other potentates, content to make them- selves obeyed\*\*,\*\* scorn the **love** which makes your glory. The hero of the North, Washington, found only enemy soldiers to conquer.   Your Excellency has all to conquer, enemies and friends, foreigners and countrymen, the fathers of the country and even the strength of his brothers. This task will not be impossible for Your Excellency, who is above his country and his epoch. In this curious letter, Bolivar discreetly made allusion to the trials and tribulations which the Haitian President suffered because of his own countrymen. He points out also the essential trait of Pétion's character: his kindness. This sentiment sometimes led him to excessive indulgence, to a tolerance which bordered on weakness. Totally unselfish, he gave liberally of all he possessed, and one had only to move his easy compassion to obtain the pardon of the most guilty persons. He had a deep love for the common people, who loved him in return and called him *papa bon-coeur*.  Having to face Christophe and the difficulties which he encountered **in** his own government, torn between his natural goodness and the exi- gencies of the powerful camarilla which had formed about him, grieved also perhaps by the treachery of the only woman he ever loved, the brilliant Joute Lachenais, Pétion felt himself discouraged. Weakened, he could not resist the illness which overcame him March 29, 1818, at the age of 48. His death caused an explosion of grief such as has never been witnessed in the history of Haitian leaders; for the people, and especially the peasants, adored him. And this soldier, who had taken part in so many battles, crushed so many revolts, struggled against so many adversaries, had as his funeral oration this spontaneous cry from a man of the people: ""Pétion caused tears to flow only when he died."" Before Petion died he chose Jean-Pierre Boyer as his successor.

We walked in and out of three cafes in my neighborhood before giving up due to no available seating. Each one was filled to the brim with laptop users 

These mindless drones have effectively conquered the entire city's cafe scene, with a few brave pockets of resistance remaining. They sit there for hours on end, incessantly using their phones or online shopping. It can be presumed that these people are remote workers (and I use worker loosely here, with the belief that if you can do your job on only a laptop and in a public setting, it's likely not all that important, and probably doesn't need to exist) who frequent cafes to escape the confines of their small apartments. I can understand and empathize with this sentiment, as this city can be extremely isolating at times. However, in reality all that they accomplish is the reorientation from pure to communal isolation. Brief human interaction occurs at the placing of their order, followed by complete withdrawal from their surroundings via headphones and phone/laptop screens.  

What was previously a lively and welcoming space, filled with the sights and sounds of people reading, writing, and enjoying each other's company, has devolved into a dystopian office cafeteria. It's day and night, weekday and weekend. The remote-work hive mind is effectively punishing the rest of society for their lifestyle choices, and I am sick of these fuckers. 

My heart bleeds for the small businesses that have to put up with it. Having a patron make a single purchase and then occupy what is often limited seating for hours on end is awful for sales. Worse yet, I'm sure that this idea hasn't even crossed half of these peoples' minds. Some places do have time limited seating policies, but I've yet to see them enforced. Besides that, the only solution I see is a no laptop policy. This could work as a differentiator to competitors but would probably destroy weekday business. It's all quite a sadness.

I’m from Algarve and have a Nespresso boutique about 30 minutes from home. I work with coffee (we’re partners with Sical, we have a good Rancilio machine, and the coffee is well-extracted). I do latte art and all those things. So… why Nespresso?

I study, and in the mornings, I like to have a coffee. On average, I drink 15-20 coffees a month. I enjoy experimenting with different coffee combinations.

I’ve always used the Original system, and until recently, I had (and still have) an Essenza XN2003 (very old). The machine was given to us by a relative because the coffee button was broken. We fixed the button, and it worked perfectly for years, even with the side panels a bit loose.

Lately, the Essenza started leaking a lot of water underneath and into the reservoir, especially when using compatible capsules, and the seals are old and worn out. At the end of last year, we renovated our kitchen and installed a wooden countertop (a bad idea but affordable), so any water that leaks and sits there ends up staining the wood. I tried to repair the machine, but I couldn’t find any loose tubes, so we decided to buy a new one.

After researching, we opted for a Vertuo Pop, which was €40 at Worten.
At the boutique, I bought a box of Orifio and Hazelnut capsules, as I already knew they were good, and I had the Hazelnut as a latte in the Original system.

Now that I’ve used the Vertuo Pop for a day, I feel a bit disappointed. Although the espressos are practically the same price as the Original system capsules, the Barista range coffees (chocolate, hazelnut, etc.) are cheaper in the Original system. Moreover, even though I can make a double espresso with the larger capsules, it feels like a waste since they end up being more expensive.

I saw that the Essenza Mini is €70 at Worten, but I’m worried it might be fragile, small, or that it won’t make good-quality coffee. Would it be worth switching machines again and going back to the Original system? Would it make sense to buy a used machine and restore it (replace the seals, clean the inside, etc.)? I’ve also considered keeping both machines since the Essenza Mini is so small…

I’d appreciate any opinions, especially from those who’ve switched between the Original and Vertuo systems!",2,1737392627.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

*The face on the moon staring down at thee*

*If he smiles, sweet dreams come true*

*If he frowns, he'll come for you*

*- Old German folk song*

""That's such a creepy song,"" Ann said, shaking her head. ""Your parents would sing it to you every night?""

I shrugged. ""It wasn't the *only* song they sang to me as a kid,"" I said, feeling the need to defend my folks. ""But it was a family tradition going back generations. Like, ‘before my ancestors came to the US’ old.""

""I've never heard of it before.""

""Outside of my family, I really haven't either. I understand why.""

""Obviously.""

""But the last part never bothered me.""

""Never saw the face in the moon frown?""

""Never saw the face on the moon,"" I said.

""You aren't thinking of singing that to our kid, are you?"" Ann rubbed her very pregnant belly out of habit.

I didn't respond right away. She knew what I was thinking and started shaking her head no before the words leapt from my lips. ""I mean, it's tradition, after all.""

""No way,"" she said. ""I don't want to give our kid a complex.""

""It won't. I heard it all the time, and I'm okay."" Ann smirked, and I rolled my eyes, anticipating the joke. I cut it off at the pass. ""You married me. In fact, you couldn't wait to get in on these family traditions.""

She burst out laughing, and it made me smile. Her laugh, a huge blurt followed by nearly soundless cackles, made my heart sing. Even more so when I saw her swollen belly bob up and down with joy.

""Can I think about it, at least?"" she asked. ""I want to ask around to see if anyone else has ever heard this lullaby.""

I said sure. We changed the subject and went back to assembling the crib. Our son Mac was due in a few weeks, and we'd fallen behind in prepping his room. It wasn't totally our fault.

Needing to stretch our money, we bought a crib secondhand from someone who lived across the country. Ann found it during her late-night web crawling through Facebook groups. There were options locally, but they all looked like cheap deathtraps. I'm sure they were fine, but when Ann laid eyes on this one, it was love at first sight. She had to have it.

It was an antique but very well maintained. The seller said it had been a family heirloom they inherited when their parents died. Since the seller had no kids nor plans to have any, they put it up for sale. Oddly, they couldn't move the piece, and the price kept dropping. When it fell into Ann's target range, she sprung. Even with a higher shipping cost, it was cheaper than something new from Amazon.

The crib arrived in four boxes. The seller, who left no return address, had carefully pried apart the pieces and shipped them in separate containers. As expected, there were issues with the shipping, and we got the pieces at different times. The last box arrived yesterday, so we were reassembling it. Carefully.

""I can't believe they took this thing apart,"" I said. ""This is old-world craftsmanship.""

""I know,"" Ann said, beaming. ""It's stunning, isn't it?""

It really was. The old-world artisan had made the crib from mahogany wood, so it was as sturdy as can be. The color was a rich brown with the faintest highlights of red. But, the carvings on the head and footboards took this from a delightful piece of furniture to a room centerpiece.

In the center of the headboard was a carving of a smiling sun, their eyes cast down into the crib. The carved radiating rays went all the way to the edges of the board. Along the top, the artist carved what looked like cats, all following a crawling toddler.

The footboard was just as intricately designed. In the middle was the moon. Another face looking down at the crib with a Mona Lisa smile. The craftsman had carved the different phases in an arc, radiating from each side of the central moon. If you started from the left and followed along, the face would gradually appear as more of the moon came into view. A full, smiling face greeted you at its height before phasing back to nothing on the right.

Carved figures depicting medieval townspeople who lived and worked in a small town adorned the top. We made out most of them - butchers, bakers, blacksmiths, farmers - but a few were a mystery to us. Especially the man in the middle. It looked like a musician, but he was playing an instrument I'd never seen before. It kind of looked like a cow's horn, but I wasn't positive.

It was seeing this smiling moon face that had dislodged the lullaby from my memory.

""When Mac moves out of this, how much do you think we can sell this for?"" I asked, carefully assembling the legs to the base.

""We're not selling this,"" Ann said instantly. ""This is now our heirloom to pass down.""

""Until our kid sells it on their preferred social media marketplace sometime in the future. It'll probably be called HappyTime or Frndshp or something.""

""If we raise little Mac right, he'll hold on to it forever,"" she said, rubbing her belly again. ""I can already tell he's a good boy.""

We finished putting the crib together, and I moved it into place. We took a step back to admire it. Ann was right (as usual). This was a stunning piece of furniture. She leaned her head against my shoulder. ""We're actually doing this, huh? Becoming parents.""

""Crazy,"" I said, slinging my arm around her waist. ""I'm going to be someone's dad. Jesus.""

She laughed. ""You're going to be a great dad.""

""Only if I sing my family's traditional song to them.""

She laughed. ""Not a chance. Can I get you to rub my feet? They're killing me.""

A few hours later, we headed to bed. Bedtime had gotten earlier and earlier as the pregnancy advanced. I assumed it was the body's biological clock getting us ready for late-night feedings and butt changes.

Outside our window, I spied the full moon in all its glory. It was one of those freakishly large full moons that look amazing in person, but when you snap a picture, it just never captures the astonishing view. I called Ann over to take a peek.

She waddled over to the window and glanced up. ""Damn, the moon looks huge. Like, 'size of my belly' big.""

I reached out and rubbed her protruding stomach. ""I wouldn't go that far.""

""Oh my god,"" she said, pointing up. ""I…."" She started laughing at first, but soon tears began falling.

""What? Are you okay? Is something wrong with the baby?""

""I…I think I see a face on the moon.""

""What?""

She pointed up again. ""Off to the side. The darker spots look like a face. See it?""

""No.""

""It's…smiling.""

I rolled my eyes. ""Are you fucking with me?""

""No, I swear,"" she said. ""Do you honestly not see it?""

""I don't,"" I confessed. ""It just looks like the moon.""

""Hold on a second."" She grabbed her phone, zoomed in, and snapped a photo. She showed me and pointed at what she said was a smiling face. ""See it?""

""Kinda, but not really.""

""Wow. Do you see any face at all?""

I looked back up at the full moon. ""Nope,"" I said, scanning the surface for anything that might trick my mind and finding nothing.

""What do I get again if I see a smiling face? Sweet treats? I could use a snack.""

""Dreams. Sweet dreams,"" I corrected. ""Does this mean that we can sing the song to Mac now?""

""Not if there's a chance he'll see a frowning moon. The world is already fracturing. We don't need to add on some lunar curses for good measure,"" Ann said. ""You coming to bed?""

""Go ahead,"" I said, still staring up at the moon, ""I think I caught a second wind. I'm gonna stay up for a bit.""

""Don't be up too late. Remember, we have that appointment tomorrow.""

I kissed her forehead and sent her back to bed. Within minutes, Ann was asleep. She's like a robot in that way - she just powers down. The pregnancy has made it easier for her to slip away to the land of nod.

I was tired, but I was also curious. Ann seeing a face on the moon really hit me. I wasn't jealous (well, maybe a little), but I suddenly had a desire to look up the lullaby's origins. I hopped on my computer and started searching but came up empty. There wasn't a single thing out there about the song.

I glanced at the clock and saw it was just after ten. My dad, a notorious night owl, was probably still up. I decided to give him a call and see if he knew anything. He picked up on the second ring.

""Everything okay with my grandkid?""

""Yes, yes,"" I said. ""Mac and Ann are fine.""

""Thank God,"" he said, chuckling. ""I can't begin to tell you how nervous I am on your behalf. I'm so worried something bad is going to happen. Never had this when your mom was pregnant with you.""

""Maybe I wasn't as important to you as your first grandbaby,"" I joked.

He laughed. ""Yeah, that must be it. What's going on? Why the late-night call?""

""I have a random question for you. You remember the nursery rhyme you guys used to sing to me when I was a kid?""

""I sang a lot of songs.""

""The one about the moon smiling and frowning. The old German one?""

""Oh yeah,"" he said. ""That one was an odd. I hadn't thought about it for years, but it popped back into my head when you were born. It's probably because my folks sang it to me all the time as a kid. It was strange. Maybe that part of your brain gets activated when you finally have a little one?""

""What do you know about it?""

""Not much, admittedly. My parents sang it to me, and theirs sang it to them. It was some old family tradition. Kind of like Hank the Elf, ya know?""

Hank the Elf was Santa's magical helper, who would leave me chocolates in a sock I hung off my dresser every night in December. Sometimes, we'd exchange notes. Even after I knew Hank was my dad, I'd still write notes to Hank, and, like clockwork, he'd write back. I couldn't wait to do that with Mac.

""It's weird. I can't find anything about it online. Like, nothing. No lyrics. No history. No recorded melody. It just doesn't exist anywhere outside of our family.""

""That is odd. My parents always told me it was an old folk song, and I had no reason to doubt it. There's seriously nothing?""

""Look yourself,"" I said.

I heard him typing away on his computer. A few seconds later, he sighed. ""Well, ain't that something?""

""Did our ancient ancestors make up the song and never spread it around?""

""I dunno,"" he said. ""Maybe you can check in with a professor of mythology or music or Middle Age history? They might shed some light on it.""

""Maybe it was part of a ritual or something,"" I said, half jokingly. ""Maybe the elders were witches or something?""

He laughed. ""If they were, and I never got the ability to cast spells, I'm going to be so upset.""

We bullshitted a little before I told him about the new crib. I switched over to Facetime and went into Mac's room. I showed him the crib, and he was impressed. He adored the little carvings but worried they might be a choking hazard if Mac broke them off.

""I hadn't thought of that,"" I said.

""You will. As soon as the boy arrives, your 'dad brain' kicks in, and all you'll be able to think about is all the ways everyday items inside your house might spell death for your kids. It's exhausting.""

""We've already started babyproofing cabinets,"" I said. ""I hate the locks so much.""

He laughed. ""I thought you were going to do a dinosaur theme in his room. When did you switch to a storybook theme?""

""We didn't switch.""

""Then why get a bed with figures from the pied piper on it?""

""What?""

""The guy in the middle is playing a flute.""

""That doesn't make him the pied piper.""

""But then why is the other side a bunch of rats being led by a toddler?""

""Those are cats,"" I said.

""Son, you may want to look at them again.""

I walked over to the crib and inspected the carved animals closely. From afar, I swore they were cats, but up close, there was no denying I was wrong. They were rats. ""Son-of-a-bitch. You're right. They are rats.""

""The teeth weren't a giveaway?"" he asked.

""I hadn't even paid attention, to be honest. I doubt Ann did because when she mentioned it to me a few weeks ago, she said something about cats.""

""'Parent brain' comes for us all. Consider this the first of many times you'll be too tired or emotionally drained to think straight. Welcome to the club.""

We chatted a bit more before saying our goodbyes and hanging up. I'd been half-paying attention to what my dad was saying for a couple of reasons. For one, he was going long on an article he read once, years ago, that talked about the story of the actual pied piper. In my dad's typical storytelling fashion, he included every fact or half-remembered fact that ended up muddying the narrative. Apparently, a bunch of kids in 1200s Germany died or went missing or something. Some people said the piper was a metaphor for death, some said he was real, and others said he was a witch. I dunno. Dad was all over the place.

For two, I couldn't shake the image of the pied piper being carved into a crib. Why in the world would anyone ever make a bed with that as the theme? The guy ends up drowning all those kids. Who would want a nightly reminder of that?

A thought streaked across my brain. What would Ann think when I told her about this in the morning? How crushed would she be? She loved this crib.

I turned to leave the room when I heard a car turn down our street, blasting a bass-heavy song. It was so loud it rattled our indoor fixtures. I opened up the blinds, flooding the room with moonlight, and glared out. I spied a lifted truck with blue running lights slowly driving down our street. They seemed determined to wake up the whole goddamn neighborhood.

Then I chuckled to myself. ""Jesus, I'm becoming an old man already. This kid has aged me.""

I went to pull the blinds back down when I glanced up at the full moon. That's when I saw it. My jaw went slack, and I could hear blood whooshing in my ears. Tears welled up and burst, rolling down my frozen face. I hadn't wanted to believe Ann earlier because it sounded so impossible. And yet, here it was, looking down at me.

A face on the moon…and he was frowning.

""Oh fu…"" I said before I heard something snap behind me. I turned and looked but saw nothing out of place. At first. In the yellow moonlight, I saw what had snapped. A single figure had been ripped from the crib. The pied piper.

I flipped on the light but couldn't see where the figure had fallen. I didn't know how it had snapped off. The figure must have cracked during shipping and finally broken off the railing. That seemed farfetched, though. I'd seen the piper figure firmly attached earlier. But what else could it be? Nothing running through my brain made sense. It was just me in here, and it's not like it broke itself off the crib. It was just a piece of wood.

I ran over to the crib and flung off the mattress. The figure had disappeared. I was about to move the crib aside to check behind the dresser next to it when I froze. The moon's smiling face on the footboard had changed to a frown. The sun on the headboard was gone altogether.

I let go of the railing like it was electrified and stumbled back. In the corner of my mind, I heard the faintest notes from a flute play. My eyes caught the shadow of a man dart behind me. That was my cue to get the hell out.

I bolted out, slamming the door behind me. I turned to make sure nothing had followed me out of the room. There was nothing. I waited a second or two just to make sure.

""What are you doing?"" It was Ann. The shock of hearing her voice made me scream. ""You feeling okay?""

""I...I saw a face. On, on the moon.""

She looked crushed. She walked over to me and stroked my arm. ""You saw a frown, didn't you?""

""I, I did.""

""Well, you know what that means, right?"" she asked, staring deeply into my eyes. ""It means you're going to die.""

That shocked me. ""Wh-why would you say that?""

""Because I'm going to be the one who kills you.""

I yanked my arm away from her touch. I tried to respond, but my voice died in my throat. My wife - my beautiful, lovely, sweet wife - had just threatened to kill me in her normal honeyed voice. It was as matter-of-fact as if she asked me to switch the laundry over. We locked eyes, and she smiled wide. Too wide.

The skin at the corners of her mouth cracked and slowly but violently pulled apart. The skin tore in strips, and blood spurted from the wounds. She didn't react at all. Instead, she crammed her hands into the sides of her mouth. She squeezed down on the shredded flaps, her fingers as tight as a vise, and yanked her arms away from her body.

Her face tore and ripped away from her skull. Each hand held a jagged edge of bloody flesh. It wobbled in her grip, the nerves firing off their last bit of stored energy. The muscles under her skin twitched and pulsated. Blood oozed from them.

She dropped the skin, and it plopped to the ground with a wet slap. Her hands went back to her face. Putting both hands back in her mouth, she started pulling up. Hard. She let out a strained grunt that gave way to the bones in her face and skull cracking. Some shards burst through the muscle as the top of her head lifted off her body. With a final bit of effort, she pulled the top of her head clean off.

Underneath was the featureless face of the pied piper figure.

Without thinking, I threw a punch. It landed with a crunch, but it wasn't the wood that crumbled. It was my poor fist. The pied piper raised my wife's hand and shamed me, shaking her finger back and forth. The piper reached into the gap at her neck and yanked hard, splitting her body in two.

The halves of my wife's body fell like a butcher had sliced them. Standing in front of me now was the now human-sized wooden pied piper. It had freed itself from the crib and come looking for me. Now that it had me, it raised the horn to its face. Music started playing inside my head.

For a fleeting second, I felt my body calm. My mind, which had been racing like a lost Andretti relative, instantly soothed. The edges of my vision softened, and from the piles of gore in front of me, I saw dozens of plants rising. My house gave way to a verdant meadow with soft, rolling hills in the distance. The sky above was so blue I had to shield my eyes from the color. Fluffy, balloon-like clouds scudded across.

The firework explosion of blooming flowers drew my eyes away from the sky. They were the most exquisite colors I'd ever seen. Unnaturally vibrant. Not long after, fat black and yellow bumble bees zig-zagged in a blossom to drink up the alluring nectar.

It felt like I had stepped into a painting - everything was so real, but it had a sheen of artificiality. As much as the music rendered this serene image in front of me and urged me to let go, a dark corner of my brain was screaming for me to wake up from the illusion. My monkey brain knew something was wrong.

""What's all the racket?"" It was Ann. The real Ann. She emerged from our bedroom, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. The return of her voice - her real voice - helped light up the darkened part of my brain. The art project melted away, and the gore returned. I saw Ann's horrified face and heard my scared subconscious screaming again.

""Run!"" I yelled.

I pushed past the pied piper, grabbed Ann's hand, and yanked her along toward the front door. She stumbled, and only through an act of god and many intense arm workouts did I keep her upright. If we fell, I knew we'd be goners. I grabbed my keys, whipped open the door, and we took off for the car.

""Get in! GET IN!"" I yelled, fumbling with the keys to the car.

""What's happening?""

""I saw a face on the moon. It was frowning.""

She didn't say a word. She didn't have to - her facial reaction said everything. We both slid into the car. I fired up the engine and glanced over my shoulder to make sure I wasn't about to take out some poor sap walking his dog late at night. When I turned it back to the house, I saw the pied piper standing in the doorway.

He wasn't alone.

All of those wooden rats had ripped themselves off the crib and had come to life. Only, they weren't the size of regular rats. Not even the size of burly New York subway rats. These things were as big as Rottweilers. Like the piper, they had no features…save for razor-sharp teeth.

""What the hell are those?""

""Rats.""

""From where?""

""The crib,"" I said.

""Our crib?""

""After tonight, it's the dump's crib. Buckle up!""

The piper played music, but I couldn't hear it this time. But the rats could. They turned their attention toward my car. The lead rat hunched down and launched themselves onto my hood. It misjudged the slickness of my car and fell off, but by that time, the second rat was airborne.

I jammed the car into gear and slammed on the gas pedal. My car rocketed backward into the street. The rats kept coming. A third and a fourth leapt through the air and landed on my trunk. They started biting the metal, and, much to my amazement, the metal started crunching.

""What do we do? Can we stop this?""

An idea popped into my brain. I threw my phone at Ann. ""Call my dad. I have to ask him about the song.""

She dialed his number. I heard a pop from my back driver's side tire as she did. The air came screaming out. It sounded like someone in distress. The passenger side rear went too, and the back of my car dropped.

I shifted into drive and pressed on the gas. My car lurched forward, but something caught in the tires and kept us from escaping. A rat had wedged itself in the wheel well. We couldn't move forward. I switched to reverse, to rock out of it, but it was to no avail. We were stuck.

""Hello?"" It was my dad's sleepy voice. ""Is something…""

""Are there more words to the lullaby?"" I screamed.

""What?""

More metal crushing from the back and now the rear doors. The rats were eating through the goddamn car. My heart dropped when I saw the empty car seat in the back. A horrid thought flashed in my brain - would I even get a chance to meet Mac?

The piper kept playing. The rats kept eating. I kept panicking, but I held it long enough to ask, ""Dad, what are the other words to the song?""

""Uh, I used to only sing the, hold on. Gail, Gail, what were the words to that horrid German song we used to sing?""

I could hear my mom waking from her sleep. Simultaneously, another rat jumped on the hood of the car. It hissed and started gnashing at the windshield. Ann screamed. That got my mom moving.

""What's wrong?"" my mom asked, her voice panicking.

""I'll fill you in later. What about the song?""

""Umm, Go out at night and….""

""No, after that. After the moon frowning.""

""Umm, let me think.""

The windshield spider-webbed as the rat broke a small hole in the glass. ""Mom! Hurry!""

""Umm, If the moon brings forth your doom, umm, pray for the sun to return soon…or something like that.""

""I pray to whoever the fuck is listening - God, Buddha, the Sun - to return and burn these fucking things to ash!""

""Please,"" Ann added.

CRASH! The rat on the hood of the car had broken the entire windshield out. I reached over and grabbed Ann's hand. I gave it a squeeze. ""Baby, I'm so sorry. I love you more than you'll ever know,"" I said, tears flooding my eyes.

""I love you, too. Mac and I both,"" she blubbered. We closed our eyes and waited for the end. I knew the next thing I'd feel would be the gnawing of wooden teeth against my bones.

But that didn't happen.

Instead, I felt an intense warming sensation spread across my body. Through closed eyelids, the darkness purpled until it was bright red. I opened my eyes, and an intense yellow light immediately stung me. It was coming from the middle of our yard.

I shielded my eyes with my hands but tried to sneak a peek between my fingers. But the light was too intense to get a look. I heard sizzling and screaming as the rat on the hood ignited and melted into a puddle of black goo. It slid off the car, leaving a trail of sludge and a mark on the cement.

All the rats were melting.

I put the car in park, pushed open the door, and, against Ann's screaming, stepped into the street. The light had dimmed from its peak but hadn't gone out totally. But the intensity was such that I could see it clearly now. A ball of pure, pulsating yellow light hovering in my front yard.

""What the hell?""

I assumed dozens of neighbors would come rushing out of their homes to see what the commotion was, but nothing stirred. The light had done the impossible - cause a ruckus in the suburbs without attracting a Karen. The only thing the light bothered was the rats. The rats and one other thing.

The piper.

The figure was standing near the glowing ball, staring at it. It no longer had any interest in me. It raised the horn to play again, but a blast of white light from the ball ignited the piper's hand. The figure turned to run, but it was already too late. The ball of light flashed again. It was so bright it briefly lit up the entire neighborhood. The heat was so intense and focused that, in mere seconds, it reduced the pied piper to a pile of ash.

Literally, in a flash, the piper was gone.

The ball of light rotated toward me. We stared at each other for a beat. I didn't know what to do, so I nodded at it. A non-verbal thank you from a flesh and blood human. It quickly flashed three times before winking out. As it did, something heavy thudded on the grass. I was standing in the dark again.

""Is it gone?"" Ann asked, climbing out of the car.

""I...I think.""

""Jesus,"" she said, laughing. ""Our car is fucked.""

I made my way over to where I'd heard the object fall. As I got to where the glowing ball had been, I saw a perfect circle burned into my lawn. Inside that circle was the carved depiction of the smiling sun from the crib's headboard.

""Holy shit,"" I said, picking it off the ground. It was slightly warm to the touch but didn't burn my hands. In fact, I found the warmth comforting. Like a hug.

Ann joined me. She delicately ran her fingertips over the carving. ""We have to keep this. It saved us.""

""Yeah,"" I said, reaching out and touching her belly. ""It saved all of us.""

With perfect comic timing, Ann said, ""The rest of the crib has to go, though."" We laughed like idiots for ten minutes.

Afterward, I managed to guide my busted ass car back into the driveway. As Ann had declared, it was truly fucked. How the hell would I explain this to Geico?

I called my parents back and told them what had happened. They didn't doubt me. They were at the house fifteen minutes later and stayed the rest of the night. Dad even helped me drag the crib to the curb.

""Who did you order this crib from?"" I asked.

""Someone on the marketplace.""

""Show me.""

Ann brought up her phone messages and searched. She scrolled…and scrolled…and scrolled. She stopped, confused. ""The messages are gone.""

""Maybe the ad is still up in the store?"" I asked, knowing the answer already.

It wasn't. Just another layer of ""What the hell?"" to an already well-layered ""Fuck this"" cake. Ann told me everything she could remember about the account she messaged with but had limited information because who would bother to remember anything like that? She was hunting for a decent sale, not making a best friend. Turns out, she found neither.

Everyone else has fallen asleep. I'm sitting in my office, staring at the carved sun and writing this out. I'm hoping someone out there might shed some light on this for me. Has anyone heard this song? Does anyone know anything about the crib? Or how the moon and sun figure into it? Where was the land the piper was showing me? Shit, why was the pied piper part of it?

How screwed up were my ancient relatives?

Best as I can tell, and granted, this is all speculation on my part, is that the song may have activated the crib. In turn, that awakened the face on the moon, which activated the piper. I don't know what the energy ball was. I have no clue how the person selling this thing tracked Ann down. I don't see how any of this, well, magic works. All I know is that this entire ordeal felt predetermined.

I can't shake that feeling. That forces beyond my understanding and unconstrained by time and space aligned in just a way to kill me off. The uneasy feeling that this was supposed to happen to me. Like my bloodline was supposed to end tonight. What about my linage pissed off the moon? What horrid curse is in my blood…and am I passing it down to Mac?

We stopped the piper for now, but I'm worried he might return. I plan to hang the carved sun in Mac's room for protection - probably over his regular-ass Amazon Basic's crib. The boy will be the centerpiece of the room…not his creepy German bed.

It's silent in the house now. There's no piper music in my head, but I keep expecting to hear it again. He showed me some strange land, which must've been important to me or my family. Right? He was trying to lure me somewhere…but where? And why?

I'm going to put on a pot of coffee. I'm not sleeping tonight. Not until the sun rises, anyway. I'll take all the protection I can get.",2,1737392532.0,sunheadprime,0,1.0,False

*The face on the moon staring down at thee*

*If he smiles, sweet dreams come true*

*If he frowns, he'll come for you*

*- Old German folk song*

""That's such a creepy song,"" Ann said, shaking her head. ""Your parents would sing it to you every night?""

I shrugged. ""It wasn't the *only* song they sang to me as a kid,"" I said, feeling the need to defend my folks. ""But it was a family tradition going back generations. Like, ‘before my ancestors came to the US’ old.""

""I've never heard of it before.""

""Outside of my family, I really haven't either. I understand why.""

""Obviously.""

""But the last part never bothered me.""

""Never saw the face in the moon frown?""

""Never saw the face on the moon,"" I said.

""You aren't thinking of singing that to our kid, are you?"" Ann rubbed her very pregnant belly out of habit.

I didn't respond right away. She knew what I was thinking and started shaking her head no before the words leapt from my lips. ""I mean, it's tradition, after all.""

""No way,"" she said. ""I don't want to give our kid a complex.""

""It won't. I heard it all the time, and I'm okay."" Ann smirked, and I rolled my eyes, anticipating the joke. I cut it off at the pass. ""You married me. In fact, you couldn't wait to get in on these family traditions.""

She burst out laughing, and it made me smile. Her laugh, a huge blurt followed by nearly soundless cackles, made my heart sing. Even more so when I saw her swollen belly bob up and down with joy.

""Can I think about it, at least?"" she asked. ""I want to ask around to see if anyone else has ever heard this lullaby.""

I said sure. We changed the subject and went back to assembling the crib. Our son Mac was due in a few weeks, and we'd fallen behind in prepping his room. It wasn't totally our fault.

Needing to stretch our money, we bought a crib secondhand from someone who lived across the country. Ann found it during her late-night web crawling through Facebook groups. There were options locally, but they all looked like cheap deathtraps. I'm sure they were fine, but when Ann laid eyes on this one, it was love at first sight. She had to have it.

It was an antique but very well maintained. The seller said it had been a family heirloom they inherited when their parents died. Since the seller had no kids nor plans to have any, they put it up for sale. Oddly, they couldn't move the piece, and the price kept dropping. When it fell into Ann's target range, she sprung. Even with a higher shipping cost, it was cheaper than something new from Amazon.

The crib arrived in four boxes. The seller, who left no return address, had carefully pried apart the pieces and shipped them in separate containers. As expected, there were issues with the shipping, and we got the pieces at different times. The last box arrived yesterday, so we were reassembling it. Carefully.

""I can't believe they took this thing apart,"" I said. ""This is old-world craftsmanship.""

""I know,"" Ann said, beaming. ""It's stunning, isn't it?""

It really was. The old-world artisan had made the crib from mahogany wood, so it was as sturdy as can be. The color was a rich brown with the faintest highlights of red. But, the carvings on the head and footboards took this from a delightful piece of furniture to a room centerpiece.

In the center of the headboard was a carving of a smiling sun, their eyes cast down into the crib. The carved radiating rays went all the way to the edges of the board. Along the top, the artist carved what looked like cats, all following a crawling toddler.

The footboard was just as intricately designed. In the middle was the moon. Another face looking down at the crib with a Mona Lisa smile. The craftsman had carved the different phases in an arc, radiating from each side of the central moon. If you started from the left and followed along, the face would gradually appear as more of the moon came into view. A full, smiling face greeted you at its height before phasing back to nothing on the right.

Carved figures depicting medieval townspeople who lived and worked in a small town adorned the top. We made out most of them - butchers, bakers, blacksmiths, farmers - but a few were a mystery to us. Especially the man in the middle. It looked like a musician, but he was playing an instrument I'd never seen before. It kind of looked like a cow's horn, but I wasn't positive.

It was seeing this smiling moon face that had dislodged the lullaby from my memory.

""When Mac moves out of this, how much do you think we can sell this for?"" I asked, carefully assembling the legs to the base.

""We're not selling this,"" Ann said instantly. ""This is now our heirloom to pass down.""

""Until our kid sells it on their preferred social media marketplace sometime in the future. It'll probably be called HappyTime or Frndshp or something.""

""If we raise little Mac right, he'll hold on to it forever,"" she said, rubbing her belly again. ""I can already tell he's a good boy.""

We finished putting the crib together, and I moved it into place. We took a step back to admire it. Ann was right (as usual). This was a stunning piece of furniture. She leaned her head against my shoulder. ""We're actually doing this, huh? Becoming parents.""

""Crazy,"" I said, slinging my arm around her waist. ""I'm going to be someone's dad. Jesus.""

She laughed. ""You're going to be a great dad.""

""Only if I sing my family's traditional song to them.""

She laughed. ""Not a chance. Can I get you to rub my feet? They're killing me.""

A few hours later, we headed to bed. Bedtime had gotten earlier and earlier as the pregnancy advanced. I assumed it was the body's biological clock getting us ready for late-night feedings and butt changes.

Outside our window, I spied the full moon in all its glory. It was one of those freakishly large full moons that look amazing in person, but when you snap a picture, it just never captures the astonishing view. I called Ann over to take a peek.

She waddled over to the window and glanced up. ""Damn, the moon looks huge. Like, 'size of my belly' big.""

I reached out and rubbed her protruding stomach. ""I wouldn't go that far.""

""Oh my god,"" she said, pointing up. ""I…."" She started laughing at first, but soon tears began falling.

""What? Are you okay? Is something wrong with the baby?""

""I…I think I see a face on the moon.""

""What?""

She pointed up again. ""Off to the side. The darker spots look like a face. See it?""

""No.""

""It's…smiling.""

I rolled my eyes. ""Are you fucking with me?""

""No, I swear,"" she said. ""Do you honestly not see it?""

""I don't,"" I confessed. ""It just looks like the moon.""

""Hold on a second."" She grabbed her phone, zoomed in, and snapped a photo. She showed me and pointed at what she said was a smiling face. ""See it?""

""Kinda, but not really.""

""Wow. Do you see any face at all?""

I looked back up at the full moon. ""Nope,"" I said, scanning the surface for anything that might trick my mind and finding nothing.

""What do I get again if I see a smiling face? Sweet treats? I could use a snack.""

""Dreams. Sweet dreams,"" I corrected. ""Does this mean that we can sing the song to Mac now?""

""Not if there's a chance he'll see a frowning moon. The world is already fracturing. We don't need to add on some lunar curses for good measure,"" Ann said. ""You coming to bed?""

""Go ahead,"" I said, still staring up at the moon, ""I think I caught a second wind. I'm gonna stay up for a bit.""

""Don't be up too late. Remember, we have that appointment tomorrow.""

I kissed her forehead and sent her back to bed. Within minutes, Ann was asleep. She's like a robot in that way - she just powers down. The pregnancy has made it easier for her to slip away to the land of nod.

I was tired, but I was also curious. Ann seeing a face on the moon really hit me. I wasn't jealous (well, maybe a little), but I suddenly had a desire to look up the lullaby's origins. I hopped on my computer and started searching but came up empty. There wasn't a single thing out there about the song.

I glanced at the clock and saw it was just after ten. My dad, a notorious night owl, was probably still up. I decided to give him a call and see if he knew anything. He picked up on the second ring.

""Everything okay with my grandkid?""

""Yes, yes,"" I said. ""Mac and Ann are fine.""

""Thank God,"" he said, chuckling. ""I can't begin to tell you how nervous I am on your behalf. I'm so worried something bad is going to happen. Never had this when your mom was pregnant with you.""

""Maybe I wasn't as important to you as your first grandbaby,"" I joked.

He laughed. ""Yeah, that must be it. What's going on? Why the late-night call?""

""I have a random question for you. You remember the nursery rhyme you guys used to sing to me when I was a kid?""

""I sang a lot of songs.""

""The one about the moon smiling and frowning. The old German one?""

""Oh yeah,"" he said. ""That one was an odd. I hadn't thought about it for years, but it popped back into my head when you were born. It's probably because my folks sang it to me all the time as a kid. It was strange. Maybe that part of your brain gets activated when you finally have a little one?""

""What do you know about it?""

""Not much, admittedly. My parents sang it to me, and theirs sang it to them. It was some old family tradition. Kind of like Hank the Elf, ya know?""

Hank the Elf was Santa's magical helper, who would leave me chocolates in a sock I hung off my dresser every night in December. Sometimes, we'd exchange notes. Even after I knew Hank was my dad, I'd still write notes to Hank, and, like clockwork, he'd write back. I couldn't wait to do that with Mac.

""It's weird. I can't find anything about it online. Like, nothing. No lyrics. No history. No recorded melody. It just doesn't exist anywhere outside of our family.""

""That is odd. My parents always told me it was an old folk song, and I had no reason to doubt it. There's seriously nothing?""

""Look yourself,"" I said.

I heard him typing away on his computer. A few seconds later, he sighed. ""Well, ain't that something?""

""Did our ancient ancestors make up the song and never spread it around?""

""I dunno,"" he said. ""Maybe you can check in with a professor of mythology or music or Middle Age history? They might shed some light on it.""

""Maybe it was part of a ritual or something,"" I said, half jokingly. ""Maybe the elders were witches or something?""

He laughed. ""If they were, and I never got the ability to cast spells, I'm going to be so upset.""

We bullshitted a little before I told him about the new crib. I switched over to Facetime and went into Mac's room. I showed him the crib, and he was impressed. He adored the little carvings but worried they might be a choking hazard if Mac broke them off.

""I hadn't thought of that,"" I said.

""You will. As soon as the boy arrives, your 'dad brain' kicks in, and all you'll be able to think about is all the ways everyday items inside your house might spell death for your kids. It's exhausting.""

""We've already started babyproofing cabinets,"" I said. ""I hate the locks so much.""

He laughed. ""I thought you were going to do a dinosaur theme in his room. When did you switch to a storybook theme?""

""We didn't switch.""

""Then why get a bed with figures from the pied piper on it?""

""What?""

""The guy in the middle is playing a flute.""

""That doesn't make him the pied piper.""

""But then why is the other side a bunch of rats being led by a toddler?""

""Those are cats,"" I said.

""Son, you may want to look at them again.""

I walked over to the crib and inspected the carved animals closely. From afar, I swore they were cats, but up close, there was no denying I was wrong. They were rats. ""Son-of-a-bitch. You're right. They are rats.""

""The teeth weren't a giveaway?"" he asked.

""I hadn't even paid attention, to be honest. I doubt Ann did because when she mentioned it to me a few weeks ago, she said something about cats.""

""'Parent brain' comes for us all. Consider this the first of many times you'll be too tired or emotionally drained to think straight. Welcome to the club.""

We chatted a bit more before saying our goodbyes and hanging up. I'd been half-paying attention to what my dad was saying for a couple of reasons. For one, he was going long on an article he read once, years ago, that talked about the story of the actual pied piper. In my dad's typical storytelling fashion, he included every fact or half-remembered fact that ended up muddying the narrative. Apparently, a bunch of kids in 1200s Germany died or went missing or something. Some people said the piper was a metaphor for death, some said he was real, and others said he was a witch. I dunno. Dad was all over the place.

For two, I couldn't shake the image of the pied piper being carved into a crib. Why in the world would anyone ever make a bed with that as the theme? The guy ends up drowning all those kids. Who would want a nightly reminder of that?

A thought streaked across my brain. What would Ann think when I told her about this in the morning? How crushed would she be? She loved this crib.

I turned to leave the room when I heard a car turn down our street, blasting a bass-heavy song. It was so loud it rattled our indoor fixtures. I opened up the blinds, flooding the room with moonlight, and glared out. I spied a lifted truck with blue running lights slowly driving down our street. They seemed determined to wake up the whole goddamn neighborhood.

Then I chuckled to myself. ""Jesus, I'm becoming an old man already. This kid has aged me.""

I went to pull the blinds back down when I glanced up at the full moon. That's when I saw it. My jaw went slack, and I could hear blood whooshing in my ears. Tears welled up and burst, rolling down my frozen face. I hadn't wanted to believe Ann earlier because it sounded so impossible. And yet, here it was, looking down at me.

A face on the moon…and he was frowning.

""Oh fu…"" I said before I heard something snap behind me. I turned and looked but saw nothing out of place. At first. In the yellow moonlight, I saw what had snapped. A single figure had been ripped from the crib. The pied piper.

I flipped on the light but couldn't see where the figure had fallen. I didn't know how it had snapped off. The figure must have cracked during shipping and finally broken off the railing. That seemed farfetched, though. I'd seen the piper figure firmly attached earlier. But what else could it be? Nothing running through my brain made sense. It was just me in here, and it's not like it broke itself off the crib. It was just a piece of wood.

I ran over to the crib and flung off the mattress. The figure had disappeared. I was about to move the crib aside to check behind the dresser next to it when I froze. The moon's smiling face on the footboard had changed to a frown. The sun on the headboard was gone altogether.

I let go of the railing like it was electrified and stumbled back. In the corner of my mind, I heard the faintest notes from a flute play. My eyes caught the shadow of a man dart behind me. That was my cue to get the hell out.

I bolted out, slamming the door behind me. I turned to make sure nothing had followed me out of the room. There was nothing. I waited a second or two just to make sure.

""What are you doing?"" It was Ann. The shock of hearing her voice made me scream. ""You feeling okay?""

""I...I saw a face. On, on the moon.""

She looked crushed. She walked over to me and stroked my arm. ""You saw a frown, didn't you?""

""I, I did.""

""Well, you know what that means, right?"" she asked, staring deeply into my eyes. ""It means you're going to die.""

That shocked me. ""Wh-why would you say that?""

""Because I'm going to be the one who kills you.""

I yanked my arm away from her touch. I tried to respond, but my voice died in my throat. My wife - my beautiful, lovely, sweet wife - had just threatened to kill me in her normal honeyed voice. It was as matter-of-fact as if she asked me to switch the laundry over. We locked eyes, and she smiled wide. Too wide.

The skin at the corners of her mouth cracked and slowly but violently pulled apart. The skin tore in strips, and blood spurted from the wounds. She didn't react at all. Instead, she crammed her hands into the sides of her mouth. She squeezed down on the shredded flaps, her fingers as tight as a vise, and yanked her arms away from her body.

Her face tore and ripped away from her skull. Each hand held a jagged edge of bloody flesh. It wobbled in her grip, the nerves firing off their last bit of stored energy. The muscles under her skin twitched and pulsated. Blood oozed from them.

She dropped the skin, and it plopped to the ground with a wet slap. Her hands went back to her face. Putting both hands back in her mouth, she started pulling up. Hard. She let out a strained grunt that gave way to the bones in her face and skull cracking. Some shards burst through the muscle as the top of her head lifted off her body. With a final bit of effort, she pulled the top of her head clean off.

Underneath was the featureless face of the pied piper figure.

Without thinking, I threw a punch. It landed with a crunch, but it wasn't the wood that crumbled. It was my poor fist. The pied piper raised my wife's hand and shamed me, shaking her finger back and forth. The piper reached into the gap at her neck and yanked hard, splitting her body in two.

The halves of my wife's body fell like a butcher had sliced them. Standing in front of me now was the now human-sized wooden pied piper. It had freed itself from the crib and come looking for me. Now that it had me, it raised the horn to its face. Music started playing inside my head.

For a fleeting second, I felt my body calm. My mind, which had been racing like a lost Andretti relative, instantly soothed. The edges of my vision softened, and from the piles of gore in front of me, I saw dozens of plants rising. My house gave way to a verdant meadow with soft, rolling hills in the distance. The sky above was so blue I had to shield my eyes from the color. Fluffy, balloon-like clouds scudded across.

The firework explosion of blooming flowers drew my eyes away from the sky. They were the most exquisite colors I'd ever seen. Unnaturally vibrant. Not long after, fat black and yellow bumble bees zig-zagged in a blossom to drink up the alluring nectar.

It felt like I had stepped into a painting - everything was so real, but it had a sheen of artificiality. As much as the music rendered this serene image in front of me and urged me to let go, a dark corner of my brain was screaming for me to wake up from the illusion. My monkey brain knew something was wrong.

""What's all the racket?"" It was Ann. The real Ann. She emerged from our bedroom, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. The return of her voice - her real voice - helped light up the darkened part of my brain. The art project melted away, and the gore returned. I saw Ann's horrified face and heard my scared subconscious screaming again.

""Run!"" I yelled.

I pushed past the pied piper, grabbed Ann's hand, and yanked her along toward the front door. She stumbled, and only through an act of god and many intense arm workouts did I keep her upright. If we fell, I knew we'd be goners. I grabbed my keys, whipped open the door, and we took off for the car.

""Get in! GET IN!"" I yelled, fumbling with the keys to the car.

""What's happening?""

""I saw a face on the moon. It was frowning.""

She didn't say a word. She didn't have to - her facial reaction said everything. We both slid into the car. I fired up the engine and glanced over my shoulder to make sure I wasn't about to take out some poor sap walking his dog late at night. When I turned it back to the house, I saw the pied piper standing in the doorway.

He wasn't alone.

All of those wooden rats had ripped themselves off the crib and had come to life. Only, they weren't the size of regular rats. Not even the size of burly New York subway rats. These things were as big as Rottweilers. Like the piper, they had no features…save for razor-sharp teeth.

""What the hell are those?""

""Rats.""

""From where?""

""The crib,"" I said.

""Our crib?""

""After tonight, it's the dump's crib. Buckle up!""

The piper played music, but I couldn't hear it this time. But the rats could. They turned their attention toward my car. The lead rat hunched down and launched themselves onto my hood. It misjudged the slickness of my car and fell off, but by that time, the second rat was airborne.

I jammed the car into gear and slammed on the gas pedal. My car rocketed backward into the street. The rats kept coming. A third and a fourth leapt through the air and landed on my trunk. They started biting the metal, and, much to my amazement, the metal started crunching.

""What do we do? Can we stop this?""

An idea popped into my brain. I threw my phone at Ann. ""Call my dad. I have to ask him about the song.""

She dialed his number. I heard a pop from my back driver's side tire as she did. The air came screaming out. It sounded like someone in distress. The passenger side rear went too, and the back of my car dropped.

I shifted into drive and pressed on the gas. My car lurched forward, but something caught in the tires and kept us from escaping. A rat had wedged itself in the wheel well. We couldn't move forward. I switched to reverse, to rock out of it, but it was to no avail. We were stuck.

""Hello?"" It was my dad's sleepy voice. ""Is something…""

""Are there more words to the lullaby?"" I screamed.

""What?""

More metal crushing from the back and now the rear doors. The rats were eating through the goddamn car. My heart dropped when I saw the empty car seat in the back. A horrid thought flashed in my brain - would I even get a chance to meet Mac?

The piper kept playing. The rats kept eating. I kept panicking, but I held it long enough to ask, ""Dad, what are the other words to the song?""

""Uh, I used to only sing the, hold on. Gail, Gail, what were the words to that horrid German song we used to sing?""

I could hear my mom waking from her sleep. Simultaneously, another rat jumped on the hood of the car. It hissed and started gnashing at the windshield. Ann screamed. That got my mom moving.

""What's wrong?"" my mom asked, her voice panicking.

""I'll fill you in later. What about the song?""

""Umm, Go out at night and….""

""No, after that. After the moon frowning.""

""Umm, let me think.""

The windshield spider-webbed as the rat broke a small hole in the glass. ""Mom! Hurry!""

""Umm, If the moon brings forth your doom, umm, pray for the sun to return soon…or something like that.""

""I pray to whoever the fuck is listening - God, Buddha, the Sun - to return and burn these fucking things to ash!""

""Please,"" Ann added.

CRASH! The rat on the hood of the car had broken the entire windshield out. I reached over and grabbed Ann's hand. I gave it a squeeze. ""Baby, I'm so sorry. I love you more than you'll ever know,"" I said, tears flooding my eyes.

""I love you, too. Mac and I both,"" she blubbered. We closed our eyes and waited for the end. I knew the next thing I'd feel would be the gnawing of wooden teeth against my bones.

But that didn't happen.

Instead, I felt an intense warming sensation spread across my body. Through closed eyelids, the darkness purpled until it was bright red. I opened my eyes, and an intense yellow light immediately stung me. It was coming from the middle of our yard.

I shielded my eyes with my hands but tried to sneak a peek between my fingers. But the light was too intense to get a look. I heard sizzling and screaming as the rat on the hood ignited and melted into a puddle of black goo. It slid off the car, leaving a trail of sludge and a mark on the cement.

All the rats were melting.

I put the car in park, pushed open the door, and, against Ann's screaming, stepped into the street. The light had dimmed from its peak but hadn't gone out totally. But the intensity was such that I could see it clearly now. A ball of pure, pulsating yellow light hovering in my front yard.

""What the hell?""

I assumed dozens of neighbors would come rushing out of their homes to see what the commotion was, but nothing stirred. The light had done the impossible - cause a ruckus in the suburbs without attracting a Karen. The only thing the light bothered was the rats. The rats and one other thing.

The piper.

The figure was standing near the glowing ball, staring at it. It no longer had any interest in me. It raised the horn to play again, but a blast of white light from the ball ignited the piper's hand. The figure turned to run, but it was already too late. The ball of light flashed again. It was so bright it briefly lit up the entire neighborhood. The heat was so intense and focused that, in mere seconds, it reduced the pied piper to a pile of ash.

Literally, in a flash, the piper was gone.

The ball of light rotated toward me. We stared at each other for a beat. I didn't know what to do, so I nodded at it. A non-verbal thank you from a flesh and blood human. It quickly flashed three times before winking out. As it did, something heavy thudded on the grass. I was standing in the dark again.

""Is it gone?"" Ann asked, climbing out of the car.

""I...I think.""

""Jesus,"" she said, laughing. ""Our car is fucked.""

I made my way over to where I'd heard the object fall. As I got to where the glowing ball had been, I saw a perfect circle burned into my lawn. Inside that circle was the carved depiction of the smiling sun from the crib's headboard.

""Holy shit,"" I said, picking it off the ground. It was slightly warm to the touch but didn't burn my hands. In fact, I found the warmth comforting. Like a hug.

Ann joined me. She delicately ran her fingertips over the carving. ""We have to keep this. It saved us.""

""Yeah,"" I said, reaching out and touching her belly. ""It saved all of us.""

With perfect comic timing, Ann said, ""The rest of the crib has to go, though."" We laughed like idiots for ten minutes.

Afterward, I managed to guide my busted ass car back into the driveway. As Ann had declared, it was truly fucked. How the hell would I explain this to Geico?

I called my parents back and told them what had happened. They didn't doubt me. They were at the house fifteen minutes later and stayed the rest of the night. Dad even helped me drag the crib to the curb.

""Who did you order this crib from?"" I asked.

""Someone on the marketplace.""

""Show me.""

Ann brought up her phone messages and searched. She scrolled…and scrolled…and scrolled. She stopped, confused. ""The messages are gone.""

""Maybe the ad is still up in the store?"" I asked, knowing the answer already.

It wasn't. Just another layer of ""What the hell?"" to an already well-layered ""Fuck this"" cake. Ann told me everything she could remember about the account she messaged with but had limited information because who would bother to remember anything like that? She was hunting for a decent sale, not making a best friend. Turns out, she found neither.

Everyone else has fallen asleep. I'm sitting in my office, staring at the carved sun and writing this out. I'm hoping someone out there might shed some light on this for me. Has anyone heard this song? Does anyone know anything about the crib? Or how the moon and sun figure into it? Where was the land the piper was showing me? Shit, why was the pied piper part of it?

How screwed up were my ancient relatives?

Best as I can tell, and granted, this is all speculation on my part, is that the song may have activated the crib. In turn, that awakened the face on the moon, which activated the piper. I don't know what the energy ball was. I have no clue how the person selling this thing tracked Ann down. I don't see how any of this, well, magic works. All I know is that this entire ordeal felt predetermined.

I can't shake that feeling. That forces beyond my understanding and unconstrained by time and space aligned in just a way to kill me off. The uneasy feeling that this was supposed to happen to me. Like my bloodline was supposed to end tonight. What about my linage pissed off the moon? What horrid curse is in my blood…and am I passing it down to Mac?

We stopped the piper for now, but I'm worried he might return. I plan to hang the carved sun in Mac's room for protection - probably over his regular-ass Amazon Basic's crib. The boy will be the centerpiece of the room…not his creepy German bed.

It's silent in the house now. There's no piper music in my head, but I keep expecting to hear it again. He showed me some strange land, which must've been important to me or my family. Right? He was trying to lure me somewhere…but where? And why?

I'm going to put on a pot of coffee. I'm not sleeping tonight. Not until the sun rises, anyway. I'll take all the protection I can get.",1,1737392501.0,Odd_directions,1,0.67,False

Budget-Friendly Tips for Stocking Your First Kitchen
----------------------------------------------------

Stocking your first kitchen can feel overwhelming, especially if you're on a budget. With the right approach, you can create a well-equipped kitchen without breaking the bank. Here are some budget-friendly tips to help you stock your kitchen wisely while ensuring you have all the essentials for cooking and entertaining.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/first-home-essentials-kitchen  
  
### Understand Your Cooking Needs

Evaluate your cooking style and habits. Are you a baker or do you prefer quick meals? Knowing how you cook will guide your purchases. If you love to cook quick meals, focus on versatile tools rather than specialty gadgets that you may never use.

### Create a Shopping List

Before heading to the store, make a list of what you need. Prioritize essentials that you will use often. A clear list prevents impulse buys and helps you stick to your budget. Here are some essential items to consider:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/first-home-essentials-kitchen  
  
- Cooking utensils (spatula, ladle, tongs)
- Cutting board
- Basic knives (chef's knife, paring knife)
- Pots and pans (non-stick skillet, saucepan)
- Measuring cups and spoons
- Dinnerware (plates, bowls, glasses)

### Shop Smart

Once you have your list, consider where you'll shop. Big-box stores and dollar stores often have great deals on kitchen essentials. Thrift stores and garage sales can also be treasure troves for gently used items. Keep an eye out for sales and discounts to save even more.

### Invest in Versatile Items

When stocking your kitchen, look for items that serve multiple purposes. Instead of buying multiple pots, invest in a good-quality Dutch oven. It can be used for everything from simmering soups to baking bread. Similarly, a set of good knives can handle most cutting tasks, reducing the need for specialty tools.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/first-home-essentials-kitchen  
  
### Buy in Sets

Purchasing items in sets can save money. Look for complete knife sets, cookware, or dinnerware bundles. These bundled options often come at a lower price than buying each item separately. Plus, they ensure that your items match, giving your kitchen a cohesive look.

### Focus on Quality over Quantity

It’s better to own a few high-quality items than a crowded assortment of low-quality kitchen tools. Quality pots and pans can last for years if cared for properly and will perform better than cheaper alternatives. Investing in a sturdy cutting board, for instance, will enhance your cooking experience.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/first-home-essentials-kitchen  
  
### Utilize What You Have

Before buying new items, look around your home. You might already own some kitchen essentials. For instance, glass containers from your pantry can double as food storage. Old sheets or towels can be repurposed into kitchen cloths or aprons.

### Consider DIY Options

If you’re crafty, consider making some kitchen items yourself. You might create a spice rack using an old wooden crate or personalize your dinnerware with paint suited for ceramics. These projects can save money and add a personal touch to your kitchen.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/first-home-essentials-kitchen  
  
### Plan Your Meals

Meal planning is not just for diet control; it also helps you use your ingredients efficiently and avoid food waste. When you know what meals you want to prepare, you can purchase only what you need. This minimizes the chances of buying items that will expire or go unused.

### Take Advantage of Online Resources

Many online platforms offer deals or coupons for kitchen utensils and appliances. You can also find money-saving tips, recipes, and tutorials for beginners to help you maximize your new kitchen. Join forums or social media groups focusing on small kitchen solutions for ongoing support and inspiration.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/first-home-essentials-kitchen  
  
By following these strategies, you can stock your first kitchen with the essentials you need, all while respecting your budget. Remember, the goal is to create a space that inspires you to cook and experiment. With patience and creativity, you can build a functional kitchen without overspending.

### Conclusion

As you settle into your new home, the kitchen becomes the heart of your space, where memories are made and recipes come to life. Equipping your kitchen with essential items doesn’t have to be overwhelming or expensive. By focusing on a few fundamental tools, you set yourself up for success. Start with the basics, such as pots, pans, and utensils, and prioritize quality over quantity. This approach ensures you have what you need without cluttering your kitchen or breaking the bank.

Budget-friendly tips play a vital role in your first-time homeowner journey. Shopping sales, utilizing coupons, and exploring thrift stores can help you find those essential kitchen items at a fraction of the price. Don't shy away from second-hand shops or online marketplaces; they're treasure troves for cookware and kitchen gadgets waiting for a new home.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/first-home-essentials-kitchen  
  
Also, think about multi-purpose tools. A good chef's knife can perform multiple tasks—dicing, chopping, and slicing—making it an invaluable addition to your collection. Remember to take inventory of what you truly need versus what is often marketed as essential. This will keep your spending in check and your kitchen functional.

Creating a warm and welcoming kitchen doesn’t require you to splash out on every trendy gadget. By curating essential items and following smart budgeting strategies, you can enjoy your culinary adventures while maintaining financial peace of mind. Embrace your new space, and let it inspire you to develop your cooking skills, entertain friends, and enjoy home-cooked meals. Each step you take in stocking your kitchen is a step toward creating a place where love, laughter, and delicious food abound.

What am I doing wrong? I'm hoping to achieve a 1:2 ratio, but when I got close, it still tasted quite sour or bitter. In general, I've been struggling to taste the difference between sour and bitter, and so I'm struggling to identify if I'm over-extracting or under-extracting - but it's definitely not correct. I've watched and read many blogs and videos, but struggling to understand where to go from here. Any advice or tried and true resources for beginner at-home  dialing-in tutorials are much appreciated! 

  
PS - I did see that Stumptown recommends brewing their Holler Mountain beans at 19.5 grams to produce 1.5 oz, I found one Youtube video with the same machine that also suggested brewing these beans at a 5 grind size, 4 inner burr setting at only 18 grams - but I haven't been changed my inner burr setting.

*The face on the moon staring down at thee*

*If he smiles, sweet dreams come true*

*If he frowns, he'll come for you*

*- Old German folk song*

""That's such a creepy song,"" Ann said, shaking her head. ""Your parents would sing it to you every night?""

I shrugged. ""It wasn't the *only* song they sang to me as a kid,"" I said, feeling the need to defend my folks. ""But it was a family tradition going back generations. Like, ‘before my ancestors came to the US’ old.""

""I've never heard of it before.""

""Outside of my family, I really haven't either. I understand why.""

""Obviously.""

""But the last part never bothered me.""

""Never saw the face in the moon frown?""

""Never saw the face on the moon,"" I said.

""You aren't thinking of singing that to our kid, are you?"" Ann rubbed her very pregnant belly out of habit.

I didn't respond right away. She knew what I was thinking and started shaking her head no before the words leapt from my lips. ""I mean, it's tradition, after all.""

""No way,"" she said. ""I don't want to give our kid a complex.""

""It won't. I heard it all the time, and I'm okay."" Ann smirked, and I rolled my eyes, anticipating the joke. I cut it off at the pass. ""You married me. In fact, you couldn't wait to get in on these family traditions.""

She burst out laughing, and it made me smile. Her laugh, a huge blurt followed by nearly soundless cackles, made my heart sing. Even more so when I saw her swollen belly bob up and down with joy.

""Can I think about it, at least?"" she asked. ""I want to ask around to see if anyone else has ever heard this lullaby.""

I said sure. We changed the subject and went back to assembling the crib. Our son Mac was due in a few weeks, and we'd fallen behind in prepping his room. It wasn't totally our fault.

Needing to stretch our money, we bought a crib secondhand from someone who lived across the country. Ann found it during her late-night web crawling through Facebook groups. There were options locally, but they all looked like cheap deathtraps. I'm sure they were fine, but when Ann laid eyes on this one, it was love at first sight. She had to have it.

It was an antique but very well maintained. The seller said it had been a family heirloom they inherited when their parents died. Since the seller had no kids nor plans to have any, they put it up for sale. Oddly, they couldn't move the piece, and the price kept dropping. When it fell into Ann's target range, she sprung. Even with a higher shipping cost, it was cheaper than something new from Amazon.

The crib arrived in four boxes. The seller, who left no return address, had carefully pried apart the pieces and shipped them in separate containers. As expected, there were issues with the shipping, and we got the pieces at different times. The last box arrived yesterday, so we were reassembling it. Carefully.

""I can't believe they took this thing apart,"" I said. ""This is old-world craftsmanship.""

""I know,"" Ann said, beaming. ""It's stunning, isn't it?""

It really was. The old-world artisan had made the crib from mahogany wood, so it was as sturdy as can be. The color was a rich brown with the faintest highlights of red. But, the carvings on the head and footboards took this from a delightful piece of furniture to a room centerpiece.

In the center of the headboard was a carving of a smiling sun, their eyes cast down into the crib. The carved radiating rays went all the way to the edges of the board. Along the top, the artist carved what looked like cats, all following a crawling toddler.

The footboard was just as intricately designed. In the middle was the moon. Another face looking down at the crib with a Mona Lisa smile. The craftsman had carved the different phases in an arc, radiating from each side of the central moon. If you started from the left and followed along, the face would gradually appear as more of the moon came into view. A full, smiling face greeted you at its height before phasing back to nothing on the right.

Carved figures depicting medieval townspeople who lived and worked in a small town adorned the top. We made out most of them - butchers, bakers, blacksmiths, farmers - but a few were a mystery to us. Especially the man in the middle. It looked like a musician, but he was playing an instrument I'd never seen before. It kind of looked like a cow's horn, but I wasn't positive.

It was seeing this smiling moon face that had dislodged the lullaby from my memory.

""When Mac moves out of this, how much do you think we can sell this for?"" I asked, carefully assembling the legs to the base.

""We're not selling this,"" Ann said instantly. ""This is now our heirloom to pass down.""

""Until our kid sells it on their preferred social media marketplace sometime in the future. It'll probably be called HappyTime or Frndshp or something.""

""If we raise little Mac right, he'll hold on to it forever,"" she said, rubbing her belly again. ""I can already tell he's a good boy.""

We finished putting the crib together, and I moved it into place. We took a step back to admire it. Ann was right (as usual). This was a stunning piece of furniture. She leaned her head against my shoulder. ""We're actually doing this, huh? Becoming parents.""

""Crazy,"" I said, slinging my arm around her waist. ""I'm going to be someone's dad. Jesus.""

She laughed. ""You're going to be a great dad.""

""Only if I sing my family's traditional song to them.""

She laughed. ""Not a chance. Can I get you to rub my feet? They're killing me.""

A few hours later, we headed to bed. Bedtime had gotten earlier and earlier as the pregnancy advanced. I assumed it was the body's biological clock getting us ready for late-night feedings and butt changes.

Outside our window, I spied the full moon in all its glory. It was one of those freakishly large full moons that look amazing in person, but when you snap a picture, it just never captures the astonishing view. I called Ann over to take a peek.

She waddled over to the window and glanced up. ""Damn, the moon looks huge. Like, 'size of my belly' big.""

I reached out and rubbed her protruding stomach. ""I wouldn't go that far.""

""Oh my god,"" she said, pointing up. ""I…."" She started laughing at first, but soon tears began falling.

""What? Are you okay? Is something wrong with the baby?""

""I…I think I see a face on the moon.""

""What?""

She pointed up again. ""Off to the side. The darker spots look like a face. See it?""

""No.""

""It's…smiling.""

I rolled my eyes. ""Are you fucking with me?""

""No, I swear,"" she said. ""Do you honestly not see it?""

""I don't,"" I confessed. ""It just looks like the moon.""

""Hold on a second."" She grabbed her phone, zoomed in, and snapped a photo. She showed me and pointed at what she said was a smiling face. ""See it?""

""Kinda, but not really.""

""Wow. Do you see any face at all?""

I looked back up at the full moon. ""Nope,"" I said, scanning the surface for anything that might trick my mind and finding nothing.

""What do I get again if I see a smiling face? Sweet treats? I could use a snack.""

""Dreams. Sweet dreams,"" I corrected. ""Does this mean that we can sing the song to Mac now?""

""Not if there's a chance he'll see a frowning moon. The world is already fracturing. We don't need to add on some lunar curses for good measure,"" Ann said. ""You coming to bed?""

""Go ahead,"" I said, still staring up at the moon, ""I think I caught a second wind. I'm gonna stay up for a bit.""

""Don't be up too late. Remember, we have that appointment tomorrow.""

I kissed her forehead and sent her back to bed. Within minutes, Ann was asleep. She's like a robot in that way - she just powers down. The pregnancy has made it easier for her to slip away to the land of nod.

I was tired, but I was also curious. Ann seeing a face on the moon really hit me. I wasn't jealous (well, maybe a little), but I suddenly had a desire to look up the lullaby's origins. I hopped on my computer and started searching but came up empty. There wasn't a single thing out there about the song.

I glanced at the clock and saw it was just after ten. My dad, a notorious night owl, was probably still up. I decided to give him a call and see if he knew anything. He picked up on the second ring.

""Everything okay with my grandkid?""

""Yes, yes,"" I said. ""Mac and Ann are fine.""

""Thank God,"" he said, chuckling. ""I can't begin to tell you how nervous I am on your behalf. I'm so worried something bad is going to happen. Never had this when your mom was pregnant with you.""

""Maybe I wasn't as important to you as your first grandbaby,"" I joked.

He laughed. ""Yeah, that must be it. What's going on? Why the late-night call?""

""I have a random question for you. You remember the nursery rhyme you guys used to sing to me when I was a kid?""

""I sang a lot of songs.""

""The one about the moon smiling and frowning. The old German one?""

""Oh yeah,"" he said. ""That one was an odd. I hadn't thought about it for years, but it popped back into my head when you were born. It's probably because my folks sang it to me all the time as a kid. It was strange. Maybe that part of your brain gets activated when you finally have a little one?""

""What do you know about it?""

""Not much, admittedly. My parents sang it to me, and theirs sang it to them. It was some old family tradition. Kind of like Hank the Elf, ya know?""

Hank the Elf was Santa's magical helper, who would leave me chocolates in a sock I hung off my dresser every night in December. Sometimes, we'd exchange notes. Even after I knew Hank was my dad, I'd still write notes to Hank, and, like clockwork, he'd write back. I couldn't wait to do that with Mac.

""It's weird. I can't find anything about it online. Like, nothing. No lyrics. No history. No recorded melody. It just doesn't exist anywhere outside of our family.""

""That is odd. My parents always told me it was an old folk song, and I had no reason to doubt it. There's seriously nothing?""

""Look yourself,"" I said.

I heard him typing away on his computer. A few seconds later, he sighed. ""Well, ain't that something?""

""Did our ancient ancestors make up the song and never spread it around?""

""I dunno,"" he said. ""Maybe you can check in with a professor of mythology or music or Middle Age history? They might shed some light on it.""

""Maybe it was part of a ritual or something,"" I said, half jokingly. ""Maybe the elders were witches or something?""

He laughed. ""If they were, and I never got the ability to cast spells, I'm going to be so upset.""

We bullshitted a little before I told him about the new crib. I switched over to Facetime and went into Mac's room. I showed him the crib, and he was impressed. He adored the little carvings but worried they might be a choking hazard if Mac broke them off.

""I hadn't thought of that,"" I said.

""You will. As soon as the boy arrives, your 'dad brain' kicks in, and all you'll be able to think about is all the ways everyday items inside your house might spell death for your kids. It's exhausting.""

""We've already started babyproofing cabinets,"" I said. ""I hate the locks so much.""

He laughed. ""I thought you were going to do a dinosaur theme in his room. When did you switch to a storybook theme?""

""We didn't switch.""

""Then why get a bed with figures from the pied piper on it?""

""What?""

""The guy in the middle is playing a flute.""

""That doesn't make him the pied piper.""

""But then why is the other side a bunch of rats being led by a toddler?""

""Those are cats,"" I said.

""Son, you may want to look at them again.""

I walked over to the crib and inspected the carved animals closely. From afar, I swore they were cats, but up close, there was no denying I was wrong. They were rats. ""Son-of-a-bitch. You're right. They are rats.""

""The teeth weren't a giveaway?"" he asked.

""I hadn't even paid attention, to be honest. I doubt Ann did because when she mentioned it to me a few weeks ago, she said something about cats.""

""'Parent brain' comes for us all. Consider this the first of many times you'll be too tired or emotionally drained to think straight. Welcome to the club.""

We chatted a bit more before saying our goodbyes and hanging up. I'd been half-paying attention to what my dad was saying for a couple of reasons. For one, he was going long on an article he read once, years ago, that talked about the story of the actual pied piper. In my dad's typical storytelling fashion, he included every fact or half-remembered fact that ended up muddying the narrative. Apparently, a bunch of kids in 1200s Germany died or went missing or something. Some people said the piper was a metaphor for death, some said he was real, and others said he was a witch. I dunno. Dad was all over the place.

For two, I couldn't shake the image of the pied piper being carved into a crib. Why in the world would anyone ever make a bed with that as the theme? The guy ends up drowning all those kids. Who would want a nightly reminder of that?

A thought streaked across my brain. What would Ann think when I told her about this in the morning? How crushed would she be? She loved this crib.

I turned to leave the room when I heard a car turn down our street, blasting a bass-heavy song. It was so loud it rattled our indoor fixtures. I opened up the blinds, flooding the room with moonlight, and glared out. I spied a lifted truck with blue running lights slowly driving down our street. They seemed determined to wake up the whole goddamn neighborhood.

Then I chuckled to myself. ""Jesus, I'm becoming an old man already. This kid has aged me.""

I went to pull the blinds back down when I glanced up at the full moon. That's when I saw it. My jaw went slack, and I could hear blood whooshing in my ears. Tears welled up and burst, rolling down my frozen face. I hadn't wanted to believe Ann earlier because it sounded so impossible. And yet, here it was, looking down at me.

A face on the moon…and he was frowning.

""Oh fu…"" I said before I heard something snap behind me. I turned and looked but saw nothing out of place. At first. In the yellow moonlight, I saw what had snapped. A single figure had been ripped from the crib. The pied piper.

I flipped on the light but couldn't see where the figure had fallen. I didn't know how it had snapped off. The figure must have cracked during shipping and finally broken off the railing. That seemed farfetched, though. I'd seen the piper figure firmly attached earlier. But what else could it be? Nothing running through my brain made sense. It was just me in here, and it's not like it broke itself off the crib. It was just a piece of wood.

I ran over to the crib and flung off the mattress. The figure had disappeared. I was about to move the crib aside to check behind the dresser next to it when I froze. The moon's smiling face on the footboard had changed to a frown. The sun on the headboard was gone altogether.

I let go of the railing like it was electrified and stumbled back. In the corner of my mind, I heard the faintest notes from a flute play. My eyes caught the shadow of a man dart behind me. That was my cue to get the hell out.

I bolted out, slamming the door behind me. I turned to make sure nothing had followed me out of the room. There was nothing. I waited a second or two just to make sure.

""What are you doing?"" It was Ann. The shock of hearing her voice made me scream. ""You feeling okay?""

""I...I saw a face. On, on the moon.""

She looked crushed. She walked over to me and stroked my arm. ""You saw a frown, didn't you?""

""I, I did.""

""Well, you know what that means, right?"" she asked, staring deeply into my eyes. ""It means you're going to die.""

That shocked me. ""Wh-why would you say that?""

""Because I'm going to be the one who kills you.""

I yanked my arm away from her touch. I tried to respond, but my voice died in my throat. My wife - my beautiful, lovely, sweet wife - had just threatened to kill me in her normal honeyed voice. It was as matter-of-fact as if she asked me to switch the laundry over. We locked eyes, and she smiled wide. Too wide.

The skin at the corners of her mouth cracked and slowly but violently pulled apart. The skin tore in strips, and blood spurted from the wounds. She didn't react at all. Instead, she crammed her hands into the sides of her mouth. She squeezed down on the shredded flaps, her fingers as tight as a vise, and yanked her arms away from her body.

Her face tore and ripped away from her skull. Each hand held a jagged edge of bloody flesh. It wobbled in her grip, the nerves firing off their last bit of stored energy. The muscles under her skin twitched and pulsated. Blood oozed from them.

She dropped the skin, and it plopped to the ground with a wet slap. Her hands went back to her face. Putting both hands back in her mouth, she started pulling up. Hard. She let out a strained grunt that gave way to the bones in her face and skull cracking. Some shards burst through the muscle as the top of her head lifted off her body. With a final bit of effort, she pulled the top of her head clean off.

Underneath was the featureless face of the pied piper figure.

Without thinking, I threw a punch. It landed with a crunch, but it wasn't the wood that crumbled. It was my poor fist. The pied piper raised my wife's hand and shamed me, shaking her finger back and forth. The piper reached into the gap at her neck and yanked hard, splitting her body in two.

The halves of my wife's body fell like a butcher had sliced them. Standing in front of me now was the now human-sized wooden pied piper. It had freed itself from the crib and come looking for me. Now that it had me, it raised the horn to its face. Music started playing inside my head.

For a fleeting second, I felt my body calm. My mind, which had been racing like a lost Andretti relative, instantly soothed. The edges of my vision softened, and from the piles of gore in front of me, I saw dozens of plants rising. My house gave way to a verdant meadow with soft, rolling hills in the distance. The sky above was so blue I had to shield my eyes from the color. Fluffy, balloon-like clouds scudded across.

The firework explosion of blooming flowers drew my eyes away from the sky. They were the most exquisite colors I'd ever seen. Unnaturally vibrant. Not long after, fat black and yellow bumble bees zig-zagged in a blossom to drink up the alluring nectar.

It felt like I had stepped into a painting - everything was so real, but it had a sheen of artificiality. As much as the music rendered this serene image in front of me and urged me to let go, a dark corner of my brain was screaming for me to wake up from the illusion. My monkey brain knew something was wrong.

""What's all the racket?"" It was Ann. The real Ann. She emerged from our bedroom, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. The return of her voice - her real voice - helped light up the darkened part of my brain. The art project melted away, and the gore returned. I saw Ann's horrified face and heard my scared subconscious screaming again.

""Run!"" I yelled.

I pushed past the pied piper, grabbed Ann's hand, and yanked her along toward the front door. She stumbled, and only through an act of god and many intense arm workouts did I keep her upright. If we fell, I knew we'd be goners. I grabbed my keys, whipped open the door, and we took off for the car.

""Get in! GET IN!"" I yelled, fumbling with the keys to the car.

""What's happening?""

""I saw a face on the moon. It was frowning.""

She didn't say a word. She didn't have to - her facial reaction said everything. We both slid into the car. I fired up the engine and glanced over my shoulder to make sure I wasn't about to take out some poor sap walking his dog late at night. When I turned it back to the house, I saw the pied piper standing in the doorway.

He wasn't alone.

All of those wooden rats had ripped themselves off the crib and had come to life. Only, they weren't the size of regular rats. Not even the size of burly New York subway rats. These things were as big as Rottweilers. Like the piper, they had no features…save for razor-sharp teeth.

""What the hell are those?""

""Rats.""

""From where?""

""The crib,"" I said.

""Our crib?""

""After tonight, it's the dump's crib. Buckle up!""

The piper played music, but I couldn't hear it this time. But the rats could. They turned their attention toward my car. The lead rat hunched down and launched themselves onto my hood. It misjudged the slickness of my car and fell off, but by that time, the second rat was airborne.

I jammed the car into gear and slammed on the gas pedal. My car rocketed backward into the street. The rats kept coming. A third and a fourth leapt through the air and landed on my trunk. They started biting the metal, and, much to my amazement, the metal started crunching.

""What do we do? Can we stop this?""

An idea popped into my brain. I threw my phone at Ann. ""Call my dad. I have to ask him about the song.""

She dialed his number. I heard a pop from my back driver's side tire as she did. The air came screaming out. It sounded like someone in distress. The passenger side rear went too, and the back of my car dropped.

I shifted into drive and pressed on the gas. My car lurched forward, but something caught in the tires and kept us from escaping. A rat had wedged itself in the wheel well. We couldn't move forward. I switched to reverse, to rock out of it, but it was to no avail. We were stuck.

""Hello?"" It was my dad's sleepy voice. ""Is something…""

""Are there more words to the lullaby?"" I screamed.

""What?""

More metal crushing from the back and now the rear doors. The rats were eating through the goddamn car. My heart dropped when I saw the empty car seat in the back. A horrid thought flashed in my brain - would I even get a chance to meet Mac?

The piper kept playing. The rats kept eating. I kept panicking, but I held it long enough to ask, ""Dad, what are the other words to the song?""

""Uh, I used to only sing the, hold on. Gail, Gail, what were the words to that horrid German song we used to sing?""

I could hear my mom waking from her sleep. Simultaneously, another rat jumped on the hood of the car. It hissed and started gnashing at the windshield. Ann screamed. That got my mom moving.

""What's wrong?"" my mom asked, her voice panicking.

""I'll fill you in later. What about the song?""

""Umm, Go out at night and….""

""No, after that. After the moon frowning.""

""Umm, let me think.""

The windshield spider-webbed as the rat broke a small hole in the glass. ""Mom! Hurry!""

""Umm, If the moon brings forth your doom, umm, pray for the sun to return soon…or something like that.""

""I pray to whoever the fuck is listening - God, Buddha, the Sun - to return and burn these fucking things to ash!""

""Please,"" Ann added.

CRASH! The rat on the hood of the car had broken the entire windshield out. I reached over and grabbed Ann's hand. I gave it a squeeze. ""Baby, I'm so sorry. I love you more than you'll ever know,"" I said, tears flooding my eyes.

""I love you, too. Mac and I both,"" she blubbered. We closed our eyes and waited for the end. I knew the next thing I'd feel would be the gnawing of wooden teeth against my bones.

But that didn't happen.

Instead, I felt an intense warming sensation spread across my body. Through closed eyelids, the darkness purpled until it was bright red. I opened my eyes, and an intense yellow light immediately stung me. It was coming from the middle of our yard.

I shielded my eyes with my hands but tried to sneak a peek between my fingers. But the light was too intense to get a look. I heard sizzling and screaming as the rat on the hood ignited and melted into a puddle of black goo. It slid off the car, leaving a trail of sludge and a mark on the cement.

All the rats were melting.

I put the car in park, pushed open the door, and, against Ann's screaming, stepped into the street. The light had dimmed from its peak but hadn't gone out totally. But the intensity was such that I could see it clearly now. A ball of pure, pulsating yellow light hovering in my front yard.

""What the hell?""

I assumed dozens of neighbors would come rushing out of their homes to see what the commotion was, but nothing stirred. The light had done the impossible - cause a ruckus in the suburbs without attracting a Karen. The only thing the light bothered was the rats. The rats and one other thing.

The piper.

The figure was standing near the glowing ball, staring at it. It no longer had any interest in me. It raised the horn to play again, but a blast of white light from the ball ignited the piper's hand. The figure turned to run, but it was already too late. The ball of light flashed again. It was so bright it briefly lit up the entire neighborhood. The heat was so intense and focused that, in mere seconds, it reduced the pied piper to a pile of ash.

Literally, in a flash, the piper was gone.

The ball of light rotated toward me. We stared at each other for a beat. I didn't know what to do, so I nodded at it. A non-verbal thank you from a flesh and blood human. It quickly flashed three times before winking out. As it did, something heavy thudded on the grass. I was standing in the dark again.

""Is it gone?"" Ann asked, climbing out of the car.

""I...I think.""

""Jesus,"" she said, laughing. ""Our car is fucked.""

I made my way over to where I'd heard the object fall. As I got to where the glowing ball had been, I saw a perfect circle burned into my lawn. Inside that circle was the carved depiction of the smiling sun from the crib's headboard.

""Holy shit,"" I said, picking it off the ground. It was slightly warm to the touch but didn't burn my hands. In fact, I found the warmth comforting. Like a hug.

Ann joined me. She delicately ran her fingertips over the carving. ""We have to keep this. It saved us.""

""Yeah,"" I said, reaching out and touching her belly. ""It saved all of us.""

With perfect comic timing, Ann said, ""The rest of the crib has to go, though."" We laughed like idiots for ten minutes.

Afterward, I managed to guide my busted ass car back into the driveway. As Ann had declared, it was truly fucked. How the hell would I explain this to Geico?

I called my parents back and told them what had happened. They didn't doubt me. They were at the house fifteen minutes later and stayed the rest of the night. Dad even helped me drag the crib to the curb.

""Who did you order this crib from?"" I asked.

""Someone on the marketplace.""

""Show me.""

Ann brought up her phone messages and searched. She scrolled…and scrolled…and scrolled. She stopped, confused. ""The messages are gone.""

""Maybe the ad is still up in the store?"" I asked, knowing the answer already.

It wasn't. Just another layer of ""What the hell?"" to an already well-layered ""Fuck this"" cake. Ann told me everything she could remember about the account she messaged with but had limited information because who would bother to remember anything like that? She was hunting for a decent sale, not making a best friend. Turns out, she found neither.

Everyone else has fallen asleep. I'm sitting in my office, staring at the carved sun and writing this out. I'm hoping someone out there might shed some light on this for me. Has anyone heard this song? Does anyone know anything about the crib? Or how the moon and sun figure into it? Where was the land the piper was showing me? Shit, why was the pied piper part of it?

How screwed up were my ancient relatives?

Best as I can tell, and granted, this is all speculation on my part, is that the song may have activated the crib. In turn, that awakened the face on the moon, which activated the piper. I don't know what the energy ball was. I have no clue how the person selling this thing tracked Ann down. I don't see how any of this, well, magic works. All I know is that this entire ordeal felt predetermined.

I can't shake that feeling. That forces beyond my understanding and unconstrained by time and space aligned in just a way to kill me off. The uneasy feeling that this was supposed to happen to me. Like my bloodline was supposed to end tonight. What about my linage pissed off the moon? What horrid curse is in my blood…and am I passing it down to Mac?

We stopped the piper for now, but I'm worried he might return. I plan to hang the carved sun in Mac's room for protection - probably over his regular-ass Amazon Basic's crib. The boy will be the centerpiece of the room…not his creepy German bed.

It's silent in the house now. There's no piper music in my head, but I keep expecting to hear it again. He showed me some strange land, which must've been important to me or my family. Right? He was trying to lure me somewhere…but where? And why?

I'm going to put on a pot of coffee. I'm not sleeping tonight. Not until the sun rises, anyway. I'll take all the protection I can get.",3,1737392334.0,TheCrypticCompendium,1,1.0,False

F24, 68kg(148lb), 172cm(5’7 I guess?) 

Started my first extended fast, 32h in. Planning to break it on friday. Got through today, it was hard since I had my day off and usually I just chill at A cafe and walk around town with A cappuccino(my biggest temptation ever). Luckily my mom supported me by not pressuring me to lunch and drinking black coffee with me while having our walk. I have always failed fasting as soon as I meet up with her, because we are huge foodies and love yapping alongside a gourmet pastry🫣
Right now I feel quite weak but I already booked an evening yoga and can’t cancel it. 

Longest I have fasted has been 48h. Have been doing OMAD for A while, but I’ve had A few slip-ups and many Cappuccinos. Made A wedding cake for my best friend last week and testing that messed everything up. Want to get back to a good streak with this extended fast. 

Just posting to keep myself accountable! 
Also I really need the motivation, since I VERY easily convince myself that I’m already very good at getting this far and can allow to end it early. 

This forum had really helped me so far, thanks to all of you for your stories and advice!

","I am looking to get my first espresso setup for around $500. I want mostly espresso shots, americanos, and latte sometimes.

I saw a used GCP for $250 which seems a very good deal but I am scared this machine [might require too much tweaking or effort to get good coffee out of](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/ru0a6e/please_stop_recommending_the_gaggia_classic_pro/). I am not looking for a hobby, I'm looking for good espresso. The GCP seems to be better suited if you are willing to do temperature surfing or modding. Again I just want my coffee without complications, but I want it to be good.

Another option I have in mind is the breville barista or breville bambino with some external grinder.

Questions are:

\- Is the stock GCP really so bad without mods or temp surfing? I am no pro I just want decent espresso easily most of the time.  
\- Should I just go for a breville for an easier workflow?

*The face on the moon staring down at thee*

*If he smiles, sweet dreams come true*

*If he frowns, he'll come for you*

*- Old German folk song*

""That's such a creepy song,"" Ann said, shaking her head. ""Your parents would sing it to you every night?""

I shrugged. ""It wasn't the *only* song they sang to me as a kid,"" I said, feeling the need to defend my folks. ""But it was a family tradition going back generations. Like, ‘before my ancestors came to the US’ old.""

""I've never heard of it before.""

""Outside of my family, I really haven't either. I understand why.""

""Obviously.""

""But the last part never bothered me.""

""Never saw the face in the moon frown?""

""Never saw the face on the moon,"" I said.

""You aren't thinking of singing that to our kid, are you?"" Ann rubbed her very pregnant belly out of habit.

I didn't respond right away. She knew what I was thinking and started shaking her head no before the words leapt from my lips. ""I mean, it's tradition, after all.""

""No way,"" she said. ""I don't want to give our kid a complex.""

""It won't. I heard it all the time, and I'm okay."" Ann smirked, and I rolled my eyes, anticipating the joke. I cut it off at the pass. ""You married me. In fact, you couldn't wait to get in on these family traditions.""

She burst out laughing, and it made me smile. Her laugh, a huge blurt followed by nearly soundless cackles, made my heart sing. Even more so when I saw her swollen belly bob up and down with joy.

""Can I think about it, at least?"" she asked. ""I want to ask around to see if anyone else has ever heard this lullaby.""

I said sure. We changed the subject and went back to assembling the crib. Our son Mac was due in a few weeks, and we'd fallen behind in prepping his room. It wasn't totally our fault.

Needing to stretch our money, we bought a crib secondhand from someone who lived across the country. Ann found it during her late-night web crawling through Facebook groups. There were options locally, but they all looked like cheap deathtraps. I'm sure they were fine, but when Ann laid eyes on this one, it was love at first sight. She had to have it.

It was an antique but very well maintained. The seller said it had been a family heirloom they inherited when their parents died. Since the seller had no kids nor plans to have any, they put it up for sale. Oddly, they couldn't move the piece, and the price kept dropping. When it fell into Ann's target range, she sprung. Even with a higher shipping cost, it was cheaper than something new from Amazon.

The crib arrived in four boxes. The seller, who left no return address, had carefully pried apart the pieces and shipped them in separate containers. As expected, there were issues with the shipping, and we got the pieces at different times. The last box arrived yesterday, so we were reassembling it. Carefully.

""I can't believe they took this thing apart,"" I said. ""This is old-world craftsmanship.""

""I know,"" Ann said, beaming. ""It's stunning, isn't it?""

It really was. The old-world artisan had made the crib from mahogany wood, so it was as sturdy as can be. The color was a rich brown with the faintest highlights of red. But, the carvings on the head and footboards took this from a delightful piece of furniture to a room centerpiece.

In the center of the headboard was a carving of a smiling sun, their eyes cast down into the crib. The carved radiating rays went all the way to the edges of the board. Along the top, the artist carved what looked like cats, all following a crawling toddler.

The footboard was just as intricately designed. In the middle was the moon. Another face looking down at the crib with a Mona Lisa smile. The craftsman had carved the different phases in an arc, radiating from each side of the central moon. If you started from the left and followed along, the face would gradually appear as more of the moon came into view. A full, smiling face greeted you at its height before phasing back to nothing on the right.

Carved figures depicting medieval townspeople who lived and worked in a small town adorned the top. We made out most of them - butchers, bakers, blacksmiths, farmers - but a few were a mystery to us. Especially the man in the middle. It looked like a musician, but he was playing an instrument I'd never seen before. It kind of looked like a cow's horn, but I wasn't positive.

It was seeing this smiling moon face that had dislodged the lullaby from my memory.

""When Mac moves out of this, how much do you think we can sell this for?"" I asked, carefully assembling the legs to the base.

""We're not selling this,"" Ann said instantly. ""This is now our heirloom to pass down.""

""Until our kid sells it on their preferred social media marketplace sometime in the future. It'll probably be called HappyTime or Frndshp or something.""

""If we raise little Mac right, he'll hold on to it forever,"" she said, rubbing her belly again. ""I can already tell he's a good boy.""

We finished putting the crib together, and I moved it into place. We took a step back to admire it. Ann was right (as usual). This was a stunning piece of furniture. She leaned her head against my shoulder. ""We're actually doing this, huh? Becoming parents.""

""Crazy,"" I said, slinging my arm around her waist. ""I'm going to be someone's dad. Jesus.""

She laughed. ""You're going to be a great dad.""

""Only if I sing my family's traditional song to them.""

She laughed. ""Not a chance. Can I get you to rub my feet? They're killing me.""

A few hours later, we headed to bed. Bedtime had gotten earlier and earlier as the pregnancy advanced. I assumed it was the body's biological clock getting us ready for late-night feedings and butt changes.

Outside our window, I spied the full moon in all its glory. It was one of those freakishly large full moons that look amazing in person, but when you snap a picture, it just never captures the astonishing view. I called Ann over to take a peek.

She waddled over to the window and glanced up. ""Damn, the moon looks huge. Like, 'size of my belly' big.""

I reached out and rubbed her protruding stomach. ""I wouldn't go that far.""

""Oh my god,"" she said, pointing up. ""I…."" She started laughing at first, but soon tears began falling.

""What? Are you okay? Is something wrong with the baby?""

""I…I think I see a face on the moon.""

""What?""

She pointed up again. ""Off to the side. The darker spots look like a face. See it?""

""No.""

""It's…smiling.""

I rolled my eyes. ""Are you fucking with me?""

""No, I swear,"" she said. ""Do you honestly not see it?""

""I don't,"" I confessed. ""It just looks like the moon.""

""Hold on a second."" She grabbed her phone, zoomed in, and snapped a photo. She showed me and pointed at what she said was a smiling face. ""See it?""

""Kinda, but not really.""

""Wow. Do you see any face at all?""

I looked back up at the full moon. ""Nope,"" I said, scanning the surface for anything that might trick my mind and finding nothing.

""What do I get again if I see a smiling face? Sweet treats? I could use a snack.""

""Dreams. Sweet dreams,"" I corrected. ""Does this mean that we can sing the song to Mac now?""

""Not if there's a chance he'll see a frowning moon. The world is already fracturing. We don't need to add on some lunar curses for good measure,"" Ann said. ""You coming to bed?""

""Go ahead,"" I said, still staring up at the moon, ""I think I caught a second wind. I'm gonna stay up for a bit.""

""Don't be up too late. Remember, we have that appointment tomorrow.""

I kissed her forehead and sent her back to bed. Within minutes, Ann was asleep. She's like a robot in that way - she just powers down. The pregnancy has made it easier for her to slip away to the land of nod.

I was tired, but I was also curious. Ann seeing a face on the moon really hit me. I wasn't jealous (well, maybe a little), but I suddenly had a desire to look up the lullaby's origins. I hopped on my computer and started searching but came up empty. There wasn't a single thing out there about the song.

I glanced at the clock and saw it was just after ten. My dad, a notorious night owl, was probably still up. I decided to give him a call and see if he knew anything. He picked up on the second ring.

""Everything okay with my grandkid?""

""Yes, yes,"" I said. ""Mac and Ann are fine.""

""Thank God,"" he said, chuckling. ""I can't begin to tell you how nervous I am on your behalf. I'm so worried something bad is going to happen. Never had this when your mom was pregnant with you.""

""Maybe I wasn't as important to you as your first grandbaby,"" I joked.

He laughed. ""Yeah, that must be it. What's going on? Why the late-night call?""

""I have a random question for you. You remember the nursery rhyme you guys used to sing to me when I was a kid?""

""I sang a lot of songs.""

""The one about the moon smiling and frowning. The old German one?""

""Oh yeah,"" he said. ""That one was an odd. I hadn't thought about it for years, but it popped back into my head when you were born. It's probably because my folks sang it to me all the time as a kid. It was strange. Maybe that part of your brain gets activated when you finally have a little one?""

""What do you know about it?""

""Not much, admittedly. My parents sang it to me, and theirs sang it to them. It was some old family tradition. Kind of like Hank the Elf, ya know?""

Hank the Elf was Santa's magical helper, who would leave me chocolates in a sock I hung off my dresser every night in December. Sometimes, we'd exchange notes. Even after I knew Hank was my dad, I'd still write notes to Hank, and, like clockwork, he'd write back. I couldn't wait to do that with Mac.

""It's weird. I can't find anything about it online. Like, nothing. No lyrics. No history. No recorded melody. It just doesn't exist anywhere outside of our family.""

""That is odd. My parents always told me it was an old folk song, and I had no reason to doubt it. There's seriously nothing?""

""Look yourself,"" I said.

I heard him typing away on his computer. A few seconds later, he sighed. ""Well, ain't that something?""

""Did our ancient ancestors make up the song and never spread it around?""

""I dunno,"" he said. ""Maybe you can check in with a professor of mythology or music or Middle Age history? They might shed some light on it.""

""Maybe it was part of a ritual or something,"" I said, half jokingly. ""Maybe the elders were witches or something?""

He laughed. ""If they were, and I never got the ability to cast spells, I'm going to be so upset.""

We bullshitted a little before I told him about the new crib. I switched over to Facetime and went into Mac's room. I showed him the crib, and he was impressed. He adored the little carvings but worried they might be a choking hazard if Mac broke them off.

""I hadn't thought of that,"" I said.

""You will. As soon as the boy arrives, your 'dad brain' kicks in, and all you'll be able to think about is all the ways everyday items inside your house might spell death for your kids. It's exhausting.""

""We've already started babyproofing cabinets,"" I said. ""I hate the locks so much.""

He laughed. ""I thought you were going to do a dinosaur theme in his room. When did you switch to a storybook theme?""

""We didn't switch.""

""Then why get a bed with figures from the pied piper on it?""

""What?""

""The guy in the middle is playing a flute.""

""That doesn't make him the pied piper.""

""But then why is the other side a bunch of rats being led by a toddler?""

""Those are cats,"" I said.

""Son, you may want to look at them again.""

I walked over to the crib and inspected the carved animals closely. From afar, I swore they were cats, but up close, there was no denying I was wrong. They were rats. ""Son-of-a-bitch. You're right. They are rats.""

""The teeth weren't a giveaway?"" he asked.

""I hadn't even paid attention, to be honest. I doubt Ann did because when she mentioned it to me a few weeks ago, she said something about cats.""

""'Parent brain' comes for us all. Consider this the first of many times you'll be too tired or emotionally drained to think straight. Welcome to the club.""

We chatted a bit more before saying our goodbyes and hanging up. I'd been half-paying attention to what my dad was saying for a couple of reasons. For one, he was going long on an article he read once, years ago, that talked about the story of the actual pied piper. In my dad's typical storytelling fashion, he included every fact or half-remembered fact that ended up muddying the narrative. Apparently, a bunch of kids in 1200s Germany died or went missing or something. Some people said the piper was a metaphor for death, some said he was real, and others said he was a witch. I dunno. Dad was all over the place.

For two, I couldn't shake the image of the pied piper being carved into a crib. Why in the world would anyone ever make a bed with that as the theme? The guy ends up drowning all those kids. Who would want a nightly reminder of that?

A thought streaked across my brain. What would Ann think when I told her about this in the morning? How crushed would she be? She loved this crib.

I turned to leave the room when I heard a car turn down our street, blasting a bass-heavy song. It was so loud it rattled our indoor fixtures. I opened up the blinds, flooding the room with moonlight, and glared out. I spied a lifted truck with blue running lights slowly driving down our street. They seemed determined to wake up the whole goddamn neighborhood.

Then I chuckled to myself. ""Jesus, I'm becoming an old man already. This kid has aged me.""

I went to pull the blinds back down when I glanced up at the full moon. That's when I saw it. My jaw went slack, and I could hear blood whooshing in my ears. Tears welled up and burst, rolling down my frozen face. I hadn't wanted to believe Ann earlier because it sounded so impossible. And yet, here it was, looking down at me.

A face on the moon…and he was frowning.

""Oh fu…"" I said before I heard something snap behind me. I turned and looked but saw nothing out of place. At first. In the yellow moonlight, I saw what had snapped. A single figure had been ripped from the crib. The pied piper.

I flipped on the light but couldn't see where the figure had fallen. I didn't know how it had snapped off. The figure must have cracked during shipping and finally broken off the railing. That seemed farfetched, though. I'd seen the piper figure firmly attached earlier. But what else could it be? Nothing running through my brain made sense. It was just me in here, and it's not like it broke itself off the crib. It was just a piece of wood.

I ran over to the crib and flung off the mattress. The figure had disappeared. I was about to move the crib aside to check behind the dresser next to it when I froze. The moon's smiling face on the footboard had changed to a frown. The sun on the headboard was gone altogether.

I let go of the railing like it was electrified and stumbled back. In the corner of my mind, I heard the faintest notes from a flute play. My eyes caught the shadow of a man dart behind me. That was my cue to get the hell out.

I bolted out, slamming the door behind me. I turned to make sure nothing had followed me out of the room. There was nothing. I waited a second or two just to make sure.

""What are you doing?"" It was Ann. The shock of hearing her voice made me scream. ""You feeling okay?""

""I...I saw a face. On, on the moon.""

She looked crushed. She walked over to me and stroked my arm. ""You saw a frown, didn't you?""

""I, I did.""

""Well, you know what that means, right?"" she asked, staring deeply into my eyes. ""It means you're going to die.""

That shocked me. ""Wh-why would you say that?""

""Because I'm going to be the one who kills you.""

I yanked my arm away from her touch. I tried to respond, but my voice died in my throat. My wife - my beautiful, lovely, sweet wife - had just threatened to kill me in her normal honeyed voice. It was as matter-of-fact as if she asked me to switch the laundry over. We locked eyes, and she smiled wide. Too wide.

The skin at the corners of her mouth cracked and slowly but violently pulled apart. The skin tore in strips, and blood spurted from the wounds. She didn't react at all. Instead, she crammed her hands into the sides of her mouth. She squeezed down on the shredded flaps, her fingers as tight as a vise, and yanked her arms away from her body.

Her face tore and ripped away from her skull. Each hand held a jagged edge of bloody flesh. It wobbled in her grip, the nerves firing off their last bit of stored energy. The muscles under her skin twitched and pulsated. Blood oozed from them.

She dropped the skin, and it plopped to the ground with a wet slap. Her hands went back to her face. Putting both hands back in her mouth, she started pulling up. Hard. She let out a strained grunt that gave way to the bones in her face and skull cracking. Some shards burst through the muscle as the top of her head lifted off her body. With a final bit of effort, she pulled the top of her head clean off.

Underneath was the featureless face of the pied piper figure.

Without thinking, I threw a punch. It landed with a crunch, but it wasn't the wood that crumbled. It was my poor fist. The pied piper raised my wife's hand and shamed me, shaking her finger back and forth. The piper reached into the gap at her neck and yanked hard, splitting her body in two.

The halves of my wife's body fell like a butcher had sliced them. Standing in front of me now was the now human-sized wooden pied piper. It had freed itself from the crib and come looking for me. Now that it had me, it raised the horn to its face. Music started playing inside my head.

For a fleeting second, I felt my body calm. My mind, which had been racing like a lost Andretti relative, instantly soothed. The edges of my vision softened, and from the piles of gore in front of me, I saw dozens of plants rising. My house gave way to a verdant meadow with soft, rolling hills in the distance. The sky above was so blue I had to shield my eyes from the color. Fluffy, balloon-like clouds scudded across.

The firework explosion of blooming flowers drew my eyes away from the sky. They were the most exquisite colors I'd ever seen. Unnaturally vibrant. Not long after, fat black and yellow bumble bees zig-zagged in a blossom to drink up the alluring nectar.

It felt like I had stepped into a painting - everything was so real, but it had a sheen of artificiality. As much as the music rendered this serene image in front of me and urged me to let go, a dark corner of my brain was screaming for me to wake up from the illusion. My monkey brain knew something was wrong.

""What's all the racket?"" It was Ann. The real Ann. She emerged from our bedroom, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. The return of her voice - her real voice - helped light up the darkened part of my brain. The art project melted away, and the gore returned. I saw Ann's horrified face and heard my scared subconscious screaming again.

""Run!"" I yelled.

I pushed past the pied piper, grabbed Ann's hand, and yanked her along toward the front door. She stumbled, and only through an act of god and many intense arm workouts did I keep her upright. If we fell, I knew we'd be goners. I grabbed my keys, whipped open the door, and we took off for the car.

""Get in! GET IN!"" I yelled, fumbling with the keys to the car.

""What's happening?""

""I saw a face on the moon. It was frowning.""

She didn't say a word. She didn't have to - her facial reaction said everything. We both slid into the car. I fired up the engine and glanced over my shoulder to make sure I wasn't about to take out some poor sap walking his dog late at night. When I turned it back to the house, I saw the pied piper standing in the doorway.

He wasn't alone.

All of those wooden rats had ripped themselves off the crib and had come to life. Only, they weren't the size of regular rats. Not even the size of burly New York subway rats. These things were as big as Rottweilers. Like the piper, they had no features…save for razor-sharp teeth.

""What the hell are those?""

""Rats.""

""From where?""

""The crib,"" I said.

""Our crib?""

""After tonight, it's the dump's crib. Buckle up!""

The piper played music, but I couldn't hear it this time. But the rats could. They turned their attention toward my car. The lead rat hunched down and launched themselves onto my hood. It misjudged the slickness of my car and fell off, but by that time, the second rat was airborne.

I jammed the car into gear and slammed on the gas pedal. My car rocketed backward into the street. The rats kept coming. A third and a fourth leapt through the air and landed on my trunk. They started biting the metal, and, much to my amazement, the metal started crunching.

""What do we do? Can we stop this?""

An idea popped into my brain. I threw my phone at Ann. ""Call my dad. I have to ask him about the song.""

She dialed his number. I heard a pop from my back driver's side tire as she did. The air came screaming out. It sounded like someone in distress. The passenger side rear went too, and the back of my car dropped.

I shifted into drive and pressed on the gas. My car lurched forward, but something caught in the tires and kept us from escaping. A rat had wedged itself in the wheel well. We couldn't move forward. I switched to reverse, to rock out of it, but it was to no avail. We were stuck.

""Hello?"" It was my dad's sleepy voice. ""Is something…""

""Are there more words to the lullaby?"" I screamed.

""What?""

More metal crushing from the back and now the rear doors. The rats were eating through the goddamn car. My heart dropped when I saw the empty car seat in the back. A horrid thought flashed in my brain - would I even get a chance to meet Mac?

The piper kept playing. The rats kept eating. I kept panicking, but I held it long enough to ask, ""Dad, what are the other words to the song?""

""Uh, I used to only sing the, hold on. Gail, Gail, what were the words to that horrid German song we used to sing?""

I could hear my mom waking from her sleep. Simultaneously, another rat jumped on the hood of the car. It hissed and started gnashing at the windshield. Ann screamed. That got my mom moving.

""What's wrong?"" my mom asked, her voice panicking.

""I'll fill you in later. What about the song?""

""Umm, Go out at night and….""

""No, after that. After the moon frowning.""

""Umm, let me think.""

The windshield spider-webbed as the rat broke a small hole in the glass. ""Mom! Hurry!""

""Umm, If the moon brings forth your doom, umm, pray for the sun to return soon…or something like that.""

""I pray to whoever the fuck is listening - God, Buddha, the Sun - to return and burn these fucking things to ash!""

""Please,"" Ann added.

CRASH! The rat on the hood of the car had broken the entire windshield out. I reached over and grabbed Ann's hand. I gave it a squeeze. ""Baby, I'm so sorry. I love you more than you'll ever know,"" I said, tears flooding my eyes.

""I love you, too. Mac and I both,"" she blubbered. We closed our eyes and waited for the end. I knew the next thing I'd feel would be the gnawing of wooden teeth against my bones.

But that didn't happen.

Instead, I felt an intense warming sensation spread across my body. Through closed eyelids, the darkness purpled until it was bright red. I opened my eyes, and an intense yellow light immediately stung me. It was coming from the middle of our yard.

I shielded my eyes with my hands but tried to sneak a peek between my fingers. But the light was too intense to get a look. I heard sizzling and screaming as the rat on the hood ignited and melted into a puddle of black goo. It slid off the car, leaving a trail of sludge and a mark on the cement.

All the rats were melting.

I put the car in park, pushed open the door, and, against Ann's screaming, stepped into the street. The light had dimmed from its peak but hadn't gone out totally. But the intensity was such that I could see it clearly now. A ball of pure, pulsating yellow light hovering in my front yard.

""What the hell?""

I assumed dozens of neighbors would come rushing out of their homes to see what the commotion was, but nothing stirred. The light had done the impossible - cause a ruckus in the suburbs without attracting a Karen. The only thing the light bothered was the rats. The rats and one other thing.

The piper.

The figure was standing near the glowing ball, staring at it. It no longer had any interest in me. It raised the horn to play again, but a blast of white light from the ball ignited the piper's hand. The figure turned to run, but it was already too late. The ball of light flashed again. It was so bright it briefly lit up the entire neighborhood. The heat was so intense and focused that, in mere seconds, it reduced the pied piper to a pile of ash.

Literally, in a flash, the piper was gone.

The ball of light rotated toward me. We stared at each other for a beat. I didn't know what to do, so I nodded at it. A non-verbal thank you from a flesh and blood human. It quickly flashed three times before winking out. As it did, something heavy thudded on the grass. I was standing in the dark again.

""Is it gone?"" Ann asked, climbing out of the car.

""I...I think.""

""Jesus,"" she said, laughing. ""Our car is fucked.""

I made my way over to where I'd heard the object fall. As I got to where the glowing ball had been, I saw a perfect circle burned into my lawn. Inside that circle was the carved depiction of the smiling sun from the crib's headboard.

""Holy shit,"" I said, picking it off the ground. It was slightly warm to the touch but didn't burn my hands. In fact, I found the warmth comforting. Like a hug.

Ann joined me. She delicately ran her fingertips over the carving. ""We have to keep this. It saved us.""

""Yeah,"" I said, reaching out and touching her belly. ""It saved all of us.""

With perfect comic timing, Ann said, ""The rest of the crib has to go, though."" We laughed like idiots for ten minutes.

Afterward, I managed to guide my busted ass car back into the driveway. As Ann had declared, it was truly fucked. How the hell would I explain this to Geico?

I called my parents back and told them what had happened. They didn't doubt me. They were at the house fifteen minutes later and stayed the rest of the night. Dad even helped me drag the crib to the curb.

""Who did you order this crib from?"" I asked.

""Someone on the marketplace.""

""Show me.""

Ann brought up her phone messages and searched. She scrolled…and scrolled…and scrolled. She stopped, confused. ""The messages are gone.""

""Maybe the ad is still up in the store?"" I asked, knowing the answer already.

It wasn't. Just another layer of ""What the hell?"" to an already well-layered ""Fuck this"" cake. Ann told me everything she could remember about the account she messaged with but had limited information because who would bother to remember anything like that? She was hunting for a decent sale, not making a best friend. Turns out, she found neither.

Everyone else has fallen asleep. I'm sitting in my office, staring at the carved sun and writing this out. I'm hoping someone out there might shed some light on this for me. Has anyone heard this song? Does anyone know anything about the crib? Or how the moon and sun figure into it? Where was the land the piper was showing me? Shit, why was the pied piper part of it?

How screwed up were my ancient relatives?

Best as I can tell, and granted, this is all speculation on my part, is that the song may have activated the crib. In turn, that awakened the face on the moon, which activated the piper. I don't know what the energy ball was. I have no clue how the person selling this thing tracked Ann down. I don't see how any of this, well, magic works. All I know is that this entire ordeal felt predetermined.

I can't shake that feeling. That forces beyond my understanding and unconstrained by time and space aligned in just a way to kill me off. The uneasy feeling that this was supposed to happen to me. Like my bloodline was supposed to end tonight. What about my linage pissed off the moon? What horrid curse is in my blood…and am I passing it down to Mac?

We stopped the piper for now, but I'm worried he might return. I plan to hang the carved sun in Mac's room for protection - probably over his regular-ass Amazon Basic's crib. The boy will be the centerpiece of the room…not his creepy German bed.

It's silent in the house now. There's no piper music in my head, but I keep expecting to hear it again. He showed me some strange land, which must've been important to me or my family. Right? He was trying to lure me somewhere…but where? And why?

I'm going to put on a pot of coffee. I'm not sleeping tonight. Not until the sun rises, anyway. I'll take all the protection I can get.",1,1737392119.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Our current thinking is we start in Shinjuku, because it has easy access from the airport and our next step, which is Hakone for 2 nights. 

On the second leg, we are stuck between Shibuya and Asakusa. Here's where I'm conflicted:

**Shibuya:** 

Pros: Shibuya provides much greater access to western Tokyo, which seems to have many more interesting neighborhoods. Can walk to Ebisu area, Harijuku, etc. Shibuya seems much better connected from a transit perspective broadly. 

Cons: The cons is that the hotels in Shibuya don't offer the ability to walk out your door into a neighborhood, grab a coffee, etc. You have to do this in the middle of chaos. From a location and transit perspective, Shibuya seems to have Asakusa beat. Separately, hotel quality is poor based on price. Much better hotel options in Asakusa. 

**Asakusa:**

Pros: Seems like a much better place to be for mornings/nights before and after you kick off your day. Excellent hotel options for a reasonable price. Looks like a fun place to be. 

Cons: Difficult to get around the rest of the city. We are people that like to come back to the hotel before going out to happy hour / dinner. And the neighborhoods that we can do that with become more narrow without significant travel time. 

**Needed feedback:** Where do you suggest we stay, given the above information? I'm a little overwhelmed with the decision and would love any help",2,1737392065.0,JapanTravelTips,3,1.0,False

[Thoughts on Timemore 078 Part 1: Turbo Burrs](https://www.instagram.com/p/DE5XE4HSykP/?hl=en&img_index=1)  
  
The 78mm burrs are good filter burrs. Similar in ways to a ZP6, but higher highs along with more body.  
  
I do think there is a misconception about the turbo burrs though. Some find it tamed/boring/muted compared to ssp stuff. I think the burrs are more neutral tasting if not analytical in their presentation. Yet, this only is true if you brew them the same. There are two prominent profiles you can do with the 078 along with a mix version.  
  
\- one version is low fines, low rpm, and finer grind. This gives you the most balanced/ analytical cups. Meaning your brews will give you the best representation of the coffee without skewing it towards super sweet or acidic. You still get juicy cups and linger, but it’s toned down / not overpowering. This is all about judging the roast for what it is. Probably the safest zone when you have a small amount of coffee.  
  
\- Second version is higher fines, higher rpm (1400), and coarser grind. This gives you an extremely intense cup. Kinda like biting into a fruit. Clarity is there, but this profile is more about the intensity and complexity. With this version, the burr’s identity/signature is more present. Cups are also more blendy tasting.  
  
\- hybrid / mix is popular. It is when people go around 1000-1100 on the rpm so they can have some intensity and complexity while still getting that clarity you get with the first version .  
  
\- 078 doesn’t hinder a coffee. Funky will taste funky and a tea like coffee will be tea like. It just presents it differently.  
  
\- 078 should not be a first time type of purchase. Buy it when you know what type of coffee you like and what burr profiles are more suitable to your preference.

  
[Thoughts on Timemore 078 Part 2: 78mm SSP MP Burrs\*](https://www.instagram.com/p/DE76tNJyFPW/?hl=en&img_index=1)  
  
This is my general impressions of the new 78mm ssp mp burrs after 12 kilos or so of seasoning, little alignment, and tons of trial and error over 20ish days.  
  
Yes, they can do espresso. I have the 078 model and found plenty of room on the dial to do shots. Unfortunately, I haven’t done enough spro to comment on the general taste. I recommend slow feeding for espresso or you can lose a few grams within the burr chamber. Maybe even rdt too. I think the 064/078 burr chamber and auger system need a serious revision but that is for part 3.  
  
For filter, I find these burrs to be rather soft in presentation compared to the turbo burrs and 64 mp burrs. Even at higher rpms on the 078 the intensity isn’t quite as intense as the turbos can be at the same rpm settings. The acidity is present from high to low but, the presentation is rather different than both 64mp and 78 turbo. Best way to describe is “sparkly” or “bubbly” at its best. Probably my favorite aspect of the burrs too.  
  
Clarity wise, these burrs are more tea like and not as much body as the turbo burrs, similar to the 64 mp burrs in that aspect. Yet the flavor separation is not quite as good as the turbo burrs and 64 mp burrs. I actually find these burrs to be rather blendy at finer and coarser settings, but enough separation to get a sense of the coffee. If anything I prefer the 64 mp and 78 turbo burrs for daily pour overs. Also the zp6 to be honest. Edit: I find the 78 mp burrs when dialed to have more clarity on the finish compared to the turbos.  
  
The red speed coating could be a factor, but I also feel these definitely aren’t as forgiving as the turbo or zp6. It has a fast drawdown speed, but even after massive seasoning you can still get some noticeable harshness and astringency with off the mark.  
  
I could be having skill issues on my part, but I would say these burrs are probably better for people who primarily want to do espresso and occasionally filter. TL;DR side grade at best for filter lovers. Worth consideration for espresso lovers.

  
Bonus: I had some cups that I definitely thought were better with the 78 burrs but also some cups I thought were worse. Clarity is there, but not quite the ""upgrade"" some are looking for regarding filter only applications. ",11,1737392020.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

However, to actually get him to talk or respond to us, we have to go through his girlfriend. She is his live in partner and is more responsive. She's also a good friend of mine so contacting her is not awkward. Sometimes he's at home just reading or something and ignores our calls, or replies by text after a couple of days. 

The day before, he was away and I needed to talk to him about something important. She was there with me as we had met for coffee and shopping. I asked her if she would try calling him. She said he will call me back and not to worry. But when he didn't half an hour later, she called him. He answered right away. He said he was driving and and asked her if it was something urgent. She hung up quickly after saying nothing urgent and to call back when he's not driving, which he did, and she handed me the phone.

The first step is to come up with a plan to break you out of analysis paralysis/anxiety. The guide will help you with that, but should NOT be an end-all-be-all. You know what works best for you, so feel free to add things or adjust them as you go. NOTE: this guide will not follow your Themis/Barbri etc. schedule.

First, look at your study habits. How many hours are you getting in a day? What is preventing you from being more productive? I found that I cannot be productive at my place, so I go to a coffee shop. Creating a to-do list at the start of your day and checking things off as you go is helpful too. DELETE ALL SOCIAL MEDIA. 

Need to get up earlier? Brew coffee at night, and set it on your night stand (yes, overnight). Set your alarm for the time you need to wake up and roll over and chug the coffee, you will be awake.

We are about 5 weeks out from the exam, Ideally you should be done with all MBE topics by now and hopefully have a few MEE topics under your belt. Since that is likely not the case if you are reading this, I suggest breaking down the remainder of your studying into 2 sections 1) review of all MBE and MEE topics, and 2) practice, practice, practice. You want to get to the practice stage as quickly as possible. Here is what I suggest for Section 1, review:

1) Focus on MBE topics until you have completed all of them since they are tested on both the MEE and MBE. To help speed up the pace I suggest reading below.

2) Most programs have you doing lecture videos AND review of the 100+ page outlines. Pick one or the other but NOT both. Personally, I retain more information from reading & annotating the outlines, however, after reading the outlines (Themis only?) go to the lecture videos, and don't watch them, just take the assessment questions after each video. This way you can find out which topics you struggled with. Take note of them and review them, and move on. 

3) Create flashcards on element/factor tests and anything else you think you should. I review mine every morning as I am drinking coffee.

4) Create podcasts based on the LARGE outlines using Google NotebookLM. You can copy and paste the text of the outlines from Themis into a word document and then export as a PDF. Upload the pdf to google notebook LM and click ""audio overview"". Alternatively, you can listen to bar exam podcasts as well. I listen to them everyday as I get ready or other times I am able (shower, make breakfast, gym, driving, grocery shopping, etc.). VERY helpful for more exposure to the material.

5) If you are REALLY far behind, review only the ""Final Review Outlines"" which can be found in the back of the MBE/MEE outline books or in the outline sections online, which can be downloaded as a PDF online, they are kind of buried in the online outlines though.

6) For MEE topics, read only the Final Review Outlines, and then go and complete the assessment video questions for each topic. Then, review the topics you did not do well on, in the larger outlines.

Section 2: practice:

1) Continue with your flashcards in the morning, along with podcasts.

2) Write/type out the MEE rules to ingrain them into your memory.

3) Split your day into either: half MEE + review of model answers and Half MBE + review; or have dedicated days for each and alternate.

4) Repeat indefinitely. You want to get as much practice in as you can. 

  
I obviously have Themis, however, if anyone can chime in with helpful tips from other bar prep companies I am sure others would appreciate it. 

Good luck! There is still time, you can do this!!

He sent me some money for Christmas and I messaged him to say thank you. My mum (who has been divorced and separated from him for years now, and has remarried) has been encouraging me to reach out to him. 

I messaged him to ask him if he’d like to meet for a coffee this upcoming weekend, just to show that I’ve tried and extended an ‘olive branch’, whilst also giving him the opportunity to sort of prove himself a little and see if he might have changed a little since I last saw him (not holding out for hope on that one though). He initially declined, and then came around.

You know, the guy who materializes only twice a year: once to question your existence and once to crush your hopes. This time, he decided to grace us with his presence in a meeting he heroically scheduled himself—such dedication.

The scene opens with him perched at his desk, radiating authority despite his uncanny ability to vanish during every important meeting throughout the year. He begins with the classic: ""You don’t seem to own things at your level.""

Oh, chef's kiss. Never mind that he has already assembled an entire team to own those ""things."" But who’s keeping track, right? Certainly not him. His absence in every discussion is a strategy, really—how else could he maintain this air of detached cluelessness?

And then comes the pièce de résistance: feedback. Freshly baked nonsense delivered by someone who barely knows what day it is, let alone what the team does. You nod, suppressing the urge to ask, “Have you tried attending even one meeting to figure this out?” But hey, that’s not leadership—it's micromanagement!

By now, your patience is holding on by a single, fraying thread. All you can think is: Let's wrap up this circus, please. Deliver the canned critiques, tick your boxes, and let me go back to the actual work. The faster we finish, the faster I can update my résumé.

Oh, but the plot thickens! There’s the revelation that they have no opportunities at your level. Brilliant, isn't it? Expectation-setting without delivering anything remotely resembling... opportunities. It’s like ordering a gourmet meal and being handed a soggy napkin.

But wait—there’s more! You were lured into this mess with a job description so shiny, it could’ve been a polished scam. And now, here you are, wondering if the job market will ever recover so you can escape this sitcom.

So you sit there, smiling through the sarcasm bubbling in your head, thinking, This was not the dream. But hey, at least the coffee machine works.

After years of fighting with Google Sheets for family budgeting, I finally gave up. You know that feeling when you're trying to add a quick coffee expense on your phone, but the sheet takes forever to load, and you end up forgetting about it entirely? Yeah....

My Google Sheet was a monster: the type-nested IF statements, VLOOKUPS, and conditional formatting that would make an Excel guru weep. It worked great... on the desktop... 

https://preview.redd.it/8j3yirr6g6ee1.png?width=3508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2298f136601420c05ab0aaf84c9c2f44ec64192f

Sure, it tracked everything, but getting my family involved? Impossible. 

So I did what any frustrated dev would do - built something for myself. The app’s name is Koru. No grand plans, no ""revolutionizing personal finance"" BS. Just wanted:

* Quick expense entry (literally 2 taps)
* Real family collaboration (not just sharing a spreadsheet link)
* Custom categories that make sense for OUR family
* Progress tracking that doesn't require a PhD in Excel

The best part? No more ""hey, did you update the spreadsheet?"" conversations. Now, everyone just adds their expenses as they go, and we can actually see where our money is going.

Would love to hear your thoughts about that or your experiences with family budgeting. Are you still stuck in spreadsheet hell, or have you found your zen?

I’ve been to alishan, sun moon lake, and Taichung so we wanted to either check out Tainan or kaoshiung. Thoughts of jamming the two in a day each or picking one of them for the duration? We would leave Taipei early and likely leave early too via HSR.

I am going to start seed cycling so I just picked up a coffee grinder and then raw pumpkin seeds, flax seeds, sesame seeds and sunflower seeds. 

I am also going to pick up some soft discs to put in after sex and leave them in for maybe an hour or so afterwards.

Our relationship was intense—we shared some amazing moments, but things fell apart when we tried polyamory. We both got hurt, and eventually, we broke up.

After the breakup, I went full no-contact, focused on my projects, and started seeing good results. Things were going well until she reached out via text, asking if she could call me. During the call, she apologized for her behavior, told me she was now in therapy, had stopped drinking, and expressed interest in reconnecting.

I told her I’d think about it. A week later, I agreed to talk things out. We exchanged a few texts in December, but since she was busy with work (something I know to be true from when we were together), we didn’t meet up.

There was one strange incident where she suggested we meet for coffee. I agreed, but she later said she was too tired to walk to the coffee shop and asked if I could drive to her place instead. I declined because I was not willing to let it hop into my car like she was still my GF! We texted a bit more in new years eve, and she mentioned we should catch up soon.

However, it’s now been three weeks, and I haven’t heard anything from her. Her behavior feels confusing. On one hand, she says she wants to reconnect and have a conversation; on the other, her intermittent texts and long silences make me wonder if she’s disinterested, keeping me as a backup, or dealing with something else.

I started my journey of pen paling in COVID-19🦠😷 times, it was a japanese app and it was a cool and addictive app, I talk about friends from  various corners of the world. Actually I want to stop here but this Reddit required 500 words to post so I have to write more 😄😅 so little bit I talk you about my city, my city is very is very beautiful, it's known as pink city, if any one loves desert, forts, big palaces tiger sancturies , deer parks, camels, elephant safari , step wells, temples, mind watering sweets and royal food, then you really enjoy the city. 😄😄. I love to interact with any person  who wishes to interact with me as a pen pal, I love to read history, economics, maths and law, I have dreams of visiting London, Paris, new York, tokyo and Switzerland. I love shopping, I also love to taste cakes and nice coffees . I love watches and nice mufflers, I have some favourite colors also like black. 

Now, a little more about me. When I’m not working or caught up in life’s daily adventures, you’ll most likely find me indulging in my favorite hobbies. I’m a huge fan of K-dramas and can spend hours binge-watching them. There’s just something magical about the storytelling, characters, and beautiful visuals that keeps me hooked. If you’re into K-dramas too, I’d love to exchange recommendations and chat about our favorite shows!

Movies are another big passion of mine, whether it’s an emotional tearjerker, a laugh-out-loud comedy, or an intense thriller. I love how movies can take us to new worlds or help us see life from a different perspective. Do you have any favorite films or genres you enjoy?

Traveling is something I hold close to my heart. Exploring new places, meeting people, and learning about their cultures is truly enriching. Every trip I’ve taken has given me unforgettable memories and stories to tell. Whether it’s strolling through bustling markets, visiting serene temples, or soaking in breathtaking natural views, I find joy in every moment of the journey.

And, of course, I can’t forget my love for food! Tasting different cuisines is one of my favorite parts of traveling. From spicy curries in India to sweet desserts in different corners of the world, I’m always up for trying something new and delicious. If you’re a foodie like me, we could share our favorite recipes or dream about dishes we’d love to try.

What I’m looking for in a pen pal is someone open-minded, kind, and willing to share their thoughts, stories, and life experiences. I believe every person has a unique story to tell, and I’d love to hear yours. Whether we exchange handwritten letters, emails, or messages, I hope we can create a connection that feels genuine and enriching.

Feel free to tell me about your hobbies, your dreams, and even the little things that make you happy. Whether we discuss books, movies, travel, or even the weather in your part of the world, I’m here to listen and share my thoughts too.

I’m so excited to start this journey of friendship with you. Let’s bridge the distance and build something meaningful, one message at a time.

**Summary**

*Peter Busch-McGinley is a self-employed handyman in Max City. For the last eight years, life has been a downward spiral of loneliness and self-loathing. But that's about to change...*

 

*Peter's second chance comes at the cost of his very last family member. Grandpa Joe passed away, leaving him a farm in Mineral Village. Although Pete is filled with regret about missing his grandfather's end, he decides to accept his inheritance and start a new life in the village where he spent every summer as a child. But things aren't what they seem.*

 

*Pete is soon approached by the patron deity of the Fertile Valley and Mineral Village—the self-described Harvest Goddess. She reveals his destiny as her chosen one, the man who will save Fertile Valley by marrying its available women. As shocking as that is, the real surprise comes from his childhood friend, Queenie.*

 

*They have a daughter.*

 

*Can Pete navigate his new destiny alongside his new role as a parent? Can he become the kind of person his grandfather would be proud of? Or will the Queen of the Mines figure out how to corrupt him?*

 

The summary by these authors was spot on! They gave us a hint of what to expect, showed their authorial tone, and generally made me want to read this book. The kick-ass cover helped, but the blurb sold it for me. Although, to be fair, I’d read anything from Virgil Knightley at this point, so I came at this novel expecting to want to read it and the blurb delivered.

 

 

**Characters**

The characters in this story are compelling, and like with most harem stories, the final product is better than the sum of its parts. The story is mostly told through the eyes of our main character, Peter. We did spend some time in the head of the women in his life, but those were the exception. Still, it was more than we normally see in this genre, and I really appreciated it. I’ll break down the individual characters, but overall, I loved all of the ensemble cast.

 

**Peter Busch-McGinley:** He is the main character of this series and starts book one at approximately 29 years old. He spent his childhood summers in the Fertile Valley working on his grandfather’s farm. He had ties to the land, giving to a ‘prodigal son’ vibe to this novel. Like many people in his situation, Peter left the small town to chase dreams in the city. He ultimately found that life to be unfulfilling and regretted those life decisions. The death of his grandfather, Grandpa Joe, was the impetuous for his return to the Fertile Valley. Peter seized the moment and returned to his roots, wanting to make a living in the valley. Luckily, he inherited the family farm and a million dollars. With things going badly for him in Max City and his struggle with his sex addiction, he sought a fresh beginning.

Those decisions were definitely affected by his desire to connect with the daughter he didn’t know that he had. Realistically, it was also partly to escape his sex addiction in the city. We learn through the course of this story that Peter’s sex addiction wasn’t truly an addiction, so much as his fertility gift not translating well outside of the Fertile Valley. Without the protection of the harvest goddess, he struggled to process the boon the goddess had gifted him.

During his time living in Max City, he dropped out of college because he was shiftless and didn’t know where he fit in the world. Having been accepted into higher education, we know that Peter has some level of intelligence. After leaving school, he made his living as an unlicensed handyman. That detail was key, making him a jack of all trades. Thus, Peter’s ability to run the farm and bring it back from the brink of decay seems plausible. Too often in literature, characters have skills that don’t make sense for their backstory. That isn’t the case with this novel.

Overall, there’s a lot to like about Peter. He seems like the kind of dude you’d want to hang out with. I’d love to meet him at Yvette’s Pub for a drink, which is something that I like about my main characters. He’s not Superman, but he’s a reliable man-next-door. Someone who does the right thing when the chips are down.

At first, Peter struggles with the Harvest Goddesses’ gifts. He was tasked with the quest to repopulate the valley. He was instructed to form a harem and make a lot of babies. Through his reluctance to be non-monogamous, we see that he wasn’t just a horn dog in it for the sex. Nope, he really did want a relationship with the women he was engaging in coitus with. It took him a little bit to understand that he could have both romance and sex with multiple women in this valley. I liked that about him. I also enjoyed his dynamic with the various fairies and pixies in the novel. His reluctance with them illustrated that, at his core, he was a standup dude.

**Harvest Goddess:** She’s the harvest goddess of the Fertile Valley with ties to her old name, Freya. She was brought to America by the Vikings, where her essence was trapped in one of her symbols of power. She stayed and made the valley her home. When her other Viking gods and goddesses faded away, she remained as simply the harvest goddess and specialized in fertility (human and nature). She’s trapped in this valley, but she seems content there. She maintains her presence via her statues, and sometimes comes to life in physical form to engage with the locals. Physically, she was the embodiment of feminine perfection and had the right curves in all of the best places. Birthing hips, ample breasts, you know… goddess things. It was hinted that she looks differently for different people, but we don’t know for sure. She was more of a peripheral but guiding player in this book, but I think we’ll see more of her in later novels.

**Queenie Luna:** She is the daughter of Liz, the Mineral Town mayor and the mother of Kylie Anne. She was Peter’s childhood romantic partner, and she had been in love with him since she was eight. She did keep his daughter from him at her mother’s request, so there are trust issues to overcome. There were larger things at play with that decision, given Peter’s role in the story, but I am trying to avoid spoilers. Even with all of that, I still liked her and was rooting for them. Physically, she has blond, shoulder length hair that she mainly keeps in a ponytail. Part of her country girl charm, I think. She has a curvy body, yet is described as slim, but with a loveable womanly shape. Her blue eyes never ceased to captivate Peter, when he wasn’t distracted by her other parts, that is. Her relationship with him felt equal parts old friends and old married couple. Except there was a lot of underlying tension from their past experience and shared history. As a father myself, I had a hard time with this character. Keeping Peter from his daughter for those 8 years is unconscionable to me. That is one big hurdle to overcome, but her redemption arc did a good job of rehabilitating her.

**Elizabeth “Liz” Luna:** She’s Queenie’s hot mother and Kylie’s grandmother. Curves in all of the right places, someone Peter self-described as having the peak feminine form. She’s the mayor of Mineral City and the high priestess of town’s church to the Harvest Goddess. She was a character that existed more in the periphery than on screen, so I’m not really sure what to make of her. But the mystery was fun, and I didn’t mind how she was portrayed.

**Missy Sanford:** She’s the daughter of Chelsea Sandford, who owns the town gym. She went to college out of the valley, but she returned to her roots upon graduation. Peter only remembered her as the skinny, pimply-faced teenager obsessed with aerobics DVDs, whom he used to babysit. She grew into her body, though, and was a super attractive woman who could be a fitness model. She is an online fitness guru and runs her mom’s gym, teaching exercise classes to the locals. She prefers to rock her toned body in yoga pants and sports bra, the “just from the gym” look is her schtick. Luckily, Peter doesn’t seem to mind. Her perfect face was sharp, with a clear complexion and a set of six-pack abs. One of her quirks is that she refers to Peter as ‘City Pete,’ because he’d always visit and return to Max City where he lived with his parents who’d left the valley. She’s obsessed with Peter and has been since she was a kid. He isn’t much older than her, but he babysat her when they were kids. She is about 24 as the novel starts and ready to chase her dream of being his housewife and spitting out a few kids for him. As a character, she was all sexy red flags and stalker vibes, but I liked it. She’s the first time I’ve seen trillions of green flags and trillions of red flags all at once in one love interest. Man, maybe I need therapy!

**Darlene Copeland:** She’s one of Peter’s women and has a dream of starting and running the Mineral City Museum. She had a crush on him as a kid, when he used to babysit her. Her brother Dale, however, hated Peter and thought he was no good. That didn’t stop Darlene from wanting Peter. She lives in a trailer and has some white trash tendencies, but in all of the best ways. She’s best friends with Missy, whom she experimented with as teenagers, though she didn’t like lesbian sex. They were just so starved of cocks, since few men lived in the city. She lived the off-grid life, well off-grid lite. As from her dream of Peter and a museum, she desperately wants to become one of the priestesses of the Harvest Goddess. As a character, she was a lot of fun, I liked the sassy ginger vibes she sent off. She’s a freckle-faced redhead, rocking the cute pig tails that accent her emerald-green eyes. She’s a skinny woman, with a petite frame and worries about her smaller bust. Peter, however, reassures her that her tits are a perfect mouthful. What I liked most about her was how down to earth she was and the opposite of materialistic. She’s equally at home cooking dinner around a campfire as she is eating in some fancy restaurant.

**Kylie Anne Luna:** She’s the 8-year-old daughter of Queenie and Peter. She was fun to see on screen, a breath of cute, childish antics. However, she was written more toddler than elementary school kid. That could be due to how she was voiced, or maybe not? Given how magical the valley is, this could work if they age slower there. We don’t know the extent of the valley’s effects, so I’ll defer judgement on that until book two.

**Becca Sue MacIntyre:** She’s the skinny goth girl who runs the Mineral City flower shop. She was a petite and like all of the women in the Fertile Valley, she’s more attractive than what’s good for her. There was a lot to say about her, but that would be spoilers, but let’s just say that her character arc was fun to watch and I’m looking forward to seeing her in book two.

**Cindy Clarkson:** She’s the daughter of Yvette Clarkson, who owns and runs the pub in Mineral City. That eating establishment is named after her and serves as the town gathering place. Cindy works at Yvette’s Pub as a jack of all trades; waitress, cook and delivery driver. She seems to have narcolepsy, which isn’t explained in the first novel, though I suspect that we’re going to see those answers in the second novel. It’s set up that I think that she’s going to join Peter’s harem, but that has not happened yet.

 

 

**Plot and Pacing**

First, let’s talk about the plot of this novel. It was very simple, the main character, Peter, has to go to the Fertile Valley and reproduce. He has to get his thing on with a bunch of women and make babies. But not with one woman, no, he must go and fertilize as many wombs as possible. And if that wasn’t fun enough, he must sexually service the fairies and pixies of the valley. In doing so, he empowers them to facilitate the quest to save the valley. But wait, there’s more! The sex with those magical beings also impowered him. That plus up to his RPG stats allowed him to maintain the farm he’d inherited. He was tasked with doing this by using old school methods and eschewing modern technology. Speaking of roleplaying games, this novel is set against the backdrop of a farming sim RPG. I found the entire premise or plot of this novel to be highly enjoyable. The stakes were low, but I was hooked from the first page.

Another consideration for this novel was its pacing. In that respect, these two authors really showed their skills. The plot was simple, but Virgil Knightley and Annabelle Hawthorne kept us engaged throughout the course of this story. At first, this book was about Peter re-engaging with his old girlfriend and his newly discovered daughter. Then the plot expanded outwards, as he met the various women Mineral City. Those townies were women he’d known tangentially during his childhood. From there, his tasks continually grew; he hunted for fairies and pixies to free, he farmed his land, and he improved his cabin. There was plenty of slice of life action, with intermissions for sex with everybody and normal action that resulted from the Dark Queen and Dale subplots. Those served to keep the story churning along. Overall, I thought that the authors killed it and made such a simple concept fun. It was nice to have such an enjoyable concept that was a relatively stress-free free read.

 

 

**Audiobook Quality**

I listened to the audiobook version of this novel, and it was perfectly done. I shouldn’t be surprised that Virgil Knightley and Royal Guard Publishing put together a Grade-A production. The narrators, Boise Blue and Aurora Bliss, did an amazing job. I’ve never listened to their works before, but they definitely go on the list of folks I’d listen to again! I don’t know if they’ve ever worked together before this series, but this felt natural. I really thought I was sitting around the coffee table, drink some good brews while my friends told me a kick-ass yarn. They did a good job of setting the mood and tone for the various parts of the story.

 

 

**Sizzle Factor**

Now, let’s dive into the reason we’re all here! Let’s talk about the sex scenes in this novel, of which there were several. They were unique from anything I’ve read so far, though others are more widely read in this genre than I am. The sex in this book was mostly between Peter and the various minuscule pixies and fairies that floated around the Fertile Valley. There were some coital engagements where they remained with their womanly forms, but they remained in their miniature sizes. They acted as almost a living flesh-light, or a cock sleave. It was weird, and not something that tickles my fancy, but the writing was well done. Even better, it created a sense of otherworldliness that lent itself to the idea that the valley was magical. There were a few times where Peter had relations with his human women, specifically Missy and Queenie, but those were experienced in less detail. I would almost rather have seen more between him and his humans, than him in the fairies. That said, the story was engaging enough that I didn’t really care, I was invested in Peter’s quest. Overall, I wouldn’t say that any of this was extremely sizzle worthy, but it wasn’t horrific either. In that respect, it was a wash for me. Not a negative, not a positive, just a neutral. But, let me reiterate, the scenes that were there were well written. I know that many readers found them to be hotter than the surface of the sun!

 

 

**Overall**

First, I’ll open that I listened to this book instead of reading it on page or screen. The audiobook narrators were amazing and made the book really pop for me. The entire time I was taking my nature walks; I had a smile on my face from the sheer enjoyment of this novel. This was one of the most enjoyable listening experiences that I’ve had in a long time. I can’t say that any more strongly, I loved this book, and I think you will too.

 

The first thing that I noticed about this novel was how well-written the prose is. Normally, my own writing style is very workmanlike, and I appreciate that in others. Sometimes authors try to impress me with their verbiage, to the point where it felt like they were abusing their thesaurus. That was not the case here. This book felt very much like we were reading a book written by someone with an extensive vocabulary. When these two authors used words that I’d never heard before, it felt natural. Yeah, I had to look up a few of them but I didn’t mind at all. These two definitely made me want to restart those word of the day challenges I did in college. I need to catch up with Virgil and Annabelle, increasing my vocabulary past the four-letter words I learned in the Army.

 

Another thing that I enjoyed about this novel were the place names they used for everything. The main location was Fertile Valley with the two cities being Mineral City and Max City. They were so generically anime/videogame-esq that I didn’t have to take the story too seriously. It also meant we didn’t have the stress of placing the story anywhere specific on the globe. Even better, the names made me smile when I heard it the first time. Maybe even a slight chuckle, but shh, that’s a secret. I normally prefer more serious plots and locations, but it worked for the tone of this novel, and I was there for it!

 

Moving on, another thing that I noticed in this novel was the amount of winking that the girls in this these books do. I’ve realized that it must be Virgil thing, because you see winking and biting in almost everything he produces. That, and some blushing on the girls. Not a complaint though, I don’t mind! At this point, when I read his books, I start looking for them like I’m hunting for Easter Eggs!

 

One thing that I really enjoyed about this book was how relaxed everything felt. This was a thoroughly enjoyable novel, it almost felt like a harem equivalent of the cozy mystery as a setting. That doesn’t mean that the cast wasn’t varied, because I felt like we had a diversity of character archetypes. The plot felt laid-back, and I was there for it. No explosions that would in the world, no dragons trying to eat people, just a dude getting his nut off and making some babies to save the valley. I can’t wait for the book 2 audiobook to come out! I really should start banking money now, because at this rate Virgil Knightley is going to bankrupt me!

 

To wrap this book review up, I want to impart on you all that Fertile Valley Book 1 was the perfect combination of a farming and dating simulation that is intermixed with the witty humor that Virgil and Annabelle deliver. More than the humor, there was plenty of the fluffy goodness that will bring a smile to your face. This slice of life adventure was interesting, and I loved the characters. I think you will too, so give this book a chance!

 

There’s so much more I’d like to say about this book, but we don’t allow spoilers to slip through our spear line. So, with that… I’ll wrap this one up and put it to bed. As we close, I’d like to request that if you loved this book too, go over to Amazon and leave a review. This is a small thing, but it really does help authors find visibility in the algorithms that rule us all. Since I’m hooked on this genre, I want the creators I’m growing to love to be able to give us more of this literary crack that’s piped straight into my earholes!

I turn 32 next month and on a health journey. I would like to start adding supplements into my routine and was wondering what the Biohack community recommends.

I'm 31, Female, 5'4"", and weigh around 134lbs. (I would like to be closer to 125lbs)

I'm relatively healthy. I eat high quality food and cook nearly every meal at home and from scratch. I do a Truvani Protein smoothie for breakfast everyday with a frozen banana and GoodKarma unsweetened Flax milk +Protein and coffee.

I have a very demanding work schedule and work around 10 hours a day but it never really turns off and I find myself stressed about work basically all of the time.

I live in NYC so I walk quite a bit but this year I'm looking to incorporate an actual workout routine with strength training. (I've noticed muscle mass decreases since I turned 30).

I don't have issues sleeping most of the time. If any restlessness, it's mostly due to light levels (ex. full moon brightness can keep me up and I should look into darker shades).

I used to add flax oil and collagen powder to my morning smoothie, and take Fish Oil and a Probiotic. But I was in my mid 20's so I didn't really notice anything and stopped around 4 years ago.

I don't have any health issues besides feeling burnt-out mentally, and I do have a bit of PCOS. I struggle with a bit of acne and I'm starting to see signs of aging in my face - but thats pretty much it.

1i5u5f8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/1i5u5f8/the_tech_billionaire_war_on_woke_is_really_a_war/,"The tech billionaire war on ""woke"" is really a war on workers","# Mark Zuckerberg wants ""masculine energy"" and ""aggression"" at the office — sounds like a toxic workplace.

Our eyes do not deceive us: Meta CEO [Mark Zuckerberg is going full MAGA](http://www.salon.com/2025/01/08/mark-zuckerbergs-meta-makeover-maga-grandpa-is-about-to-get-much-worse/).

After [releasing a chilling video announcing that Facebook](https://www.salon.com/2025/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-tells-fox-news-that-meta-will-get-rid-of-fact-checkers-in-latest-appeal-to/?in_brief=true), Instagram and other Meta companies will unleash a firehose of fascist disinformation on their platforms, Zuckerberg went — where else? — on [Joe Rogan's podcast](https://www.salon.com/topic/joe_rogan_experience) to celebrate. Complete with his new frat daddy look, Zuckerberg raved about how he thinks the ""corporate world"" has been ""culturally neutered"" and complained about being ""surrounded by girls and women."" He praised ""masculine energy"" and said a culture that ""celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive."" He claimed he's not trying to exclude women, but then immediately pivoted to romanticizing his ""masculine"" martial arts training space, which is presumably segregated by gender. 

There's been a lot of media discourse about the more gossipy aspects of Zuckerberg's MAGA makeover. He does seem to have undergone several personal changes, picking up mixed martial arts fighting, dressing like an obnoxious dudebro — complete with gold chains — and talking like a masculinity grifter. He's [giving off so much ""divorced guy"" energy](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/article/divorced-guy-energy) — think Ben Affleck or Kanye West — that [social media platforms are abuzz with speculation](https://www.soapcentral.com/humor/he-s-getting-divorce-isn-t-he-users-troll-zuckerberg-comments-companies-needing-masculine-energy) that Zuckerberg's wife, who he met in college, has left him. Truly, the try-hard nature of Zuckerberg's posturing is so embarrassing it's hard to look away from. 

But, as with [Elon Musk](https://www.salon.com/topic/elon_musk), Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen and other tech billionaires, the pivot to MAGA isn't just about overgrown nerds trying (and failing) to compensate for high school insecurities. It also seems to be fueled by a deep loathing of the very people who have made these capitalists their money: the fleets of mostly desk workers who make the companies run.

Musk frequently rants on X about the ""elites,"" a word he uses almost [exclusively to describe college-educated professionals](https://x.com/search?q=elite%20(from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query&f=top) who draw middle-class or upper-middle-class incomes, i.e. the class of people doing the work that makes him rich. Yes, it's people who can often afford home ownership or summer vacations, but they still have to work for a living. Most make less in a year than Musk or Zuckerberg spend in a single trip to Mar-a-Lago. The war on ""woke"" is ultimately a war on workers. 

Like Musk before him, Zuckerberg appears to resent the people who work for him and make him rich. Zuckerberg's raving about how he wants more ""masculine energy"" and complaints that corporate culture is ""neutered"" are being celebrated by MAGA as a swipe at diversity, equity and inclusion ([DEI](https://www.salon.com/topic/dei)) programs. These programs are dismissed by the right as ""woke"" and ""virtue-signaling."" The more mundane truth, however, is that DEI is part of a larger effort to attract talented employees by making workplaces welcoming and comfortable. A culture that ""celebrates aggression,"" as Zuckerberg put it, sounds miserable for people who actually have to show up. Most adults just want to get their job done and aren't interested in chest-bumping, childish bullying, or feeling like they have to compare MMA stats to fit in. 

That Trump's incoming administration is eager to downplay the importance of workers was [revealed Thursday during the confirmation hearing for Scott Bessent](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/biden-warns-oligarchy-trump-flanked-tech-billionaires-inauguration-117764907), Trump's pick to head the Treasury Department. Citing Musk, Zuckerberg and other tech billionaires cozying up to Trump, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., asked Bessent, ""Would you agree with President Biden that an oligarchy is taking shape in America?""

Bessent replied, ""The billionaires you listed make the money themselves."" It was not only a non sequitur — where the money comes from is not the measure of whether rich people controlling government constitutes oligarchy — but it is also a flat-out lie. Thousands upon thousands of people work for these tech billionaires, churning out code, maintaining systems and running the business. Musk and Zuckerberg may not want to admit it, but they couldn't make a dime without those people. 

Meanwhile the more authoritarian, anti-worker regime at Meta has already kicked off. [As the New York Times reported earlier this week](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/technology/meta-mark-zuckerberg-trump.html), ""Meta typically"" invites ""employees, civic leaders and others to weigh in"" before a big policy change, but not this time. The new policies allowing more disinformation and hate speech on the platform were sprung on ""most of Meta’s 72,000 employees"" during the public announcement. The unwillingness to involve employees in the decision-making process has resulted in policies that don't just degrade the platforms. Employees complained ""training materials that Meta created for the new policies were confusing and contradictory."" For instance, Facebook users still cannot say ""white people have mental illness,"" but they can say ""gay people have mental illness.""

There's been a crackdown on free speech within Meta since the announcement. The company deleted messages on its internal communications system that [criticized newly appointed board member Dana White](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/meta-faces-backlash-for-deleting-employee-comments-criticising-dana-whites-board-appointment-459947-2025-01-08), a Trump-loving [professional fighter who was taped hitting his wife](https://www.espn.com/mma/ufc/story/_/id/35427773/ufc-dana-white-says-criticism-physical-altercation-wife-100-warranted). The company locked down access to policies and training materials, to prevent workers from sharing them with the press. There have also been obnoxious moves that read as evident slights to employees, such as removing tampons from men's rooms, which serves no other purpose than to signal to trans people they aren't equal at Meta. Zuckerberg also announced he's moving the company's moderation teams from California to Texas, where, he argues, ""there’s less concern about the bias of our teams."" This means forcing people to leave a state that is friendly to human rights to move to one that bans abortion and restricts queer-inclusive health care. Even for those who don't move, the message is loud and clear: Zuckerberg is signaling his contempt for their professionalism and intelligence. 

Zuckerberg may want to frame the ""neutered"" environment of his offices in gendered terms that resonate with the psychosexual hang-ups of Trump voters, but in truth, it's not really about sex at all. It's about a more boring but necessary goal: meeting the needs of everyday workers, regardless of gender, race, or sexual identity. Most people just want a peaceful place to do their job, plus a pay and benefits package that helps them meet their life goals outside of work. It's not ""woke"" that makes Silicon Valley workers spend their days wearing khakis, drinking coffee, and being generally pleasant to each other, instead of exhibiting ""masculine energy"" and ""aggression."" Basic common sense dictates that chill, congenial workplaces are better for morale and productivity. Everyday niceness may not be as exciting as beating people up at a martial arts gym, but it is what actually made Zuckerberg his money. 

""Zuckerberg blamed his former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, for an inclusivity initiative at Facebook that encouraged employees’ self-expression in the workplace,"" [the New York Times reported Thursday](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html). ""He said new guidelines and a series of layoffs amounted to a reset and that more changes were coming.""

Zuckerberg's former COO Sheryl Sandberg got a lot of grief, [much of it well-deserved, for her ""Lean In"" book](https://www.salon.com/2015/03/05/be_on_the_same_team_as_lebron_james_sheryl_sandbergs_hollow_lean_in_together_feminism/) and its watered-down, individualistic approach to feminism. But while she will never be considered a great feminist thinker, her strategy made her a success at her actual job: attracting top-level talent to Facebook and later Meta. Her ""feminine"" approach, which Zuckerberg seems so ashamed of now, focused on making employees feel valued and acknowledging that workers are full human beings, not just cogs. So the company [provides healthy benefits and salaries, on-site gyms, food, ](https://perkupapp.com/post/seven-facebook-benefits-that-employees-love)wellness centers, and varied transportation options. I agree with the cynic's take that this is all so they get more work out of people. It's also fair to say that it's a sight better than many alternatives, which expect maximum work without helping employees minimize stressors at home.

Zuckerberg may now see those efforts to address work-life balance and inclusivity as emasculating and ""woke,"" but it's not about gender. The stereotypical bachelor computer programmer also enjoys having free restaurants to eat at, rather than sadly microwaving a burrito at home for dinner. But pretending it's about masculinity is a good way to distract from the mundane fact that, like a stereotypical capitalist parasite, Zuckerberg has adopted a hostile posture towards his own workers. Perhaps, like so many of the hyper-rich before him, he doesn't like being reminded that, without his staff, he would be nothing. 

In his farewell speech to the nation Wednesday, [President Joe Biden compared the ""rise of a tech-industrial complex"" to the robber barons of the 19th and 20th centuries](https://www.salon.com/2025/01/15/threatens-our-entire-democracy-biden-takes-aim-at-tech-oligarchs-like-musk-in-farewell-address/). He warned that ""the dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultrawealthy people"" threatens not just democracy, but the basic rights of workers ""to earn their fair share."" The increasingly ugly attitude that tech billionaires take towards their own employees is a troubling indicator of this. 

We saw this already at X, formerly Twitter, where Musk, having stereotyped middle class workers as ""elites"" not deserving of respect, felt justified in stripping them of basic workers' rights. He [demanded they work long overtime hours without pay](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63648505) or sleep, insisting [they work 84 hours a week while he](https://hypebeast.com/2022/11/elon-musk-twitter-84-hour-work-week-introduction-info) sits around and tweets. He disregarded their expertise, abused them verbally and made the situation [so intolerable that many were forced to leave](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/17/23465274/hundreds-of-twitter-employees-resign-from-elon-musk-hardcore-deadline). He made them betray their basic values by catering to neo-Nazis and other scum that he let loose on Twitter. One reason he wants a carveout for H1B visas in the expected immigration crackdown is because he can use threats of deportation to extract high-intensity work for low pay from immigrant employees. 

Because the desk workers of Silicon Valley are middle class, they don't rate much sympathy in the current political discourse, which is far more focused on the partisan tug-of-war for working-class voters. But it's playing into the hands of oligarchs to reject the needs of middle class workers. The real battle is between working people, whether college-educated or not, and the hyper-wealthy, who want to suck up all the money for themselves and leave the people who do the actual labor behind. People like Musk and Zuckerberg save their rhetorical fire for the middle class desk workers who staff their companies, but the efforts to redistribute money upwards will hurt everyone, the working class most of all. This was also demonstrated during Bessent's hearing, [when he rejected a call to raise the federal minimum wage](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/scott-bessent-believes-federal-minimum-wage-should-not-be-increased-229500485731), which has been stuck at a paltry $7.25 an hour since 2009. The chatter about ""woke"" is an effort to distract Americans from a simple fact: the desk worker and the factory worker have way more in common with each other than they do with the capitalist leaders who make money on their backs. And the tech billionaires now [cozying up to Donald Trump](https://www.salon.com/2024/11/25/tech-ceos-sell-out-democrats-in-rush-to-curry-favor-with/) are not friends to any of us.

I was looking at a couple tours that go up the coast, to a few caves, but wondering if I should just rent a car for that one day and go wherever I want. I'm a coffee dork and would really like to go to Hacienda San Pedro, but it seems a bit far for a single day with not much else to see along the way, even if I kept going to Ponce. Worth the trip? Sandra farms or another easier to get to hacienda? Ponce and back too ambitious for one day?

Also considering following one of the tour routes to Arecibo and just be able to stop wherever I want along the way. 

I will also have a few days in Viesque so I'm not worried about going to any beaches on the main island, really just hoping to see a few places outside san juan that are unique to Puerto Rico. I have time to return the car the next morning before I head to viesque if needed, my hotel is already booked in SJO though so I can't overnight in another town.

","I open the pc, on grub i select mint, I see the log in screen as usual, I successfully login with the password and the screen turns black, the cursor moves to the center, I can move it, but nothing happens, I try turning the laptop off, but it doesn't work I have to long press the power button.

A few days ago it happened once, I rebooted and it worked fine.

Tonight after turning off the computer I restarted it as I had forgot to finish something, but, after logging in, it only showed the cursor, I tried logging in with wayland and it works (but as it's experimental it's not enough for what I need). Another thing that works is the guest session even if I don't set it to wayland and keep it on x11.

I don't know if it's helpful but this is what I did before I turned off the pc when it was still working: a long gaming session (noita, on steam flatpack), watching a few videos on youtube and lessons on google drive and updating a couple of packages (which I don't know the names of).

I'm on a laptop with linux mint 21.3 cinnamon, graphics card is nvidia gtx 1070 Mobile (I've noticed that the drivers in use are the 535 and tried to update them to the newest 550 that are recommended, but it doesn't actually do it when I press apply changes).

EDIT 1:  
I managed to log in using x11 by changing the kernel version at boot, 6.8.0-50 instead of 6.8.0-51.  
I don't think I have changed kernel recently, so this is still a mistery and I still need to solve the issue, as that kernel is superseeded.

EDIT 2:  
Removing the 6.8.0-51 kernel and reinstalling it worked, I don't know why, but the 11 session opened. I'm afraid and unsure if I should mark this as solved.

","I open the pc, on grub i select mint, I see the log in screen as usual, I successfully login with the password and the screen turns black, the cursor moves to the center, I can move it, but nothing happens, I try turning the laptop off, but it doesn't work I have to long press the power button.

A few days ago it happened once, I rebooted and it worked fine.

Tonight after turning off the computer I restarted it as I had forgot to finish something, but, after logging in, it only showed the cursor, I tried logging in with wayland and it works (but as it's experimental it's not enough for what I need). Another thing that works is the guest session even if I don't set it to wayland and keep it on x11.

I don't know if it's helpful but this is what I did before I turned off the pc when it was still working: a long gaming session (noita, on steam flatpack), watching a few videos on youtube and lessons on google drive and updating a couple of packages (which I don't know the names of).

I'm on a laptop with linux mint 21.3 cinnamon, graphics card is nvidia gtx 1070 Mobile (I've noticed that the drivers in use are the 535 and tried to update them to the newest 550 that are recommended, but it doesn't actually do it when I press apply changes).

EDIT 1:  
I managed to log in using x11 by changing the kernel version at boot, 6.8.0-50 instead of 6.8.0-51.  
I don't think I have changed kernel recently, so this is still a mistery and I still need to solve the issue, as that kernel is superseeded.

EDIT 2:  
Removing the 6.8.0-51 kernel and reinstalling it worked, I don't know why, but the 11 session opened. I'm afraid and unsure if I should mark this as solved.

Super quick to eat, high protein, and the coffee drink has 2 cups coffee equivalent of caffeine! (Also if you haven’t tried the peppermint mocha quest coffee I would HIGHLY recommend). The avocado mash and chicken bites are from Costco! I’ve been trying to actually eat breakfast or lunch to get more protein in, since I’ve been back in the gym lifting, and have found this a great way to incorporate more protein without it being inconvenient for me. 

And as a lactose intolerant and gluten intolerant person, these foods do not bother my stomach!

This coffee drink does have 200mg of caffeine, a good alternative with 100mg are the Alani protein coffees! They still have 10g of protein, 90cals, and are a few bucks cheaper per 12 pack case. ",4,1737390084.0,goodrestrictionfood,0,0.84,False

This isn’t my first time dealing with the instability that seems to come with working for large corporations, but it’s starting to feel like too much.

I’ve been in marketing for a while, and while I enjoy the work, the constant threat of layoffs has me questioning my career path. I want to explore options for a side hustle or potentially pivot to a role or industry with more stability, but I’m honestly not sure where to start.

Has anyone here made a similar transition? How did you figure out what to do next? Any advice on finding side hustles or transitioning to a more stable career would be really helpful.

**Summary**

*Peter Busch-McGinley is a self-employed handyman in Max City. For the last eight years, life has been a downward spiral of loneliness and self-loathing. But that's about to change...*

 

*Peter's second chance comes at the cost of his very last family member. Grandpa Joe passed away, leaving him a farm in Mineral Village. Although Pete is filled with regret about missing his grandfather's end, he decides to accept his inheritance and start a new life in the village where he spent every summer as a child. But things aren't what they seem.*

 

*Pete is soon approached by the patron deity of the Fertile Valley and Mineral Village—the self-described Harvest Goddess. She reveals his destiny as her chosen one, the man who will save Fertile Valley by marrying its available women. As shocking as that is, the real surprise comes from his childhood friend, Queenie.*

 

*They have a daughter.*

 

*Can Pete navigate his new destiny alongside his new role as a parent? Can he become the kind of person his grandfather would be proud of? Or will the Queen of the Mines figure out how to corrupt him?*

 

The summary by these authors was spot on! They gave us a hint of what to expect, showed their authorial tone, and generally made me want to read this book. The kick-ass cover helped, but the blurb sold it for me. Although, to be fair, I’d read anything from Virgil Knightley at this point, so I came at this novel expecting to want to read it and the blurb delivered.

 

 

**Characters**

The characters in this story are compelling, and like with most harem stories, the final product is better than the sum of its parts. The story is mostly told through the eyes of our main character, Peter. We did spend some time in the head of the women in his life, but those were the exception. Still, it was more than we normally see in this genre, and I really appreciated it. I’ll break down the individual characters, but overall, I loved all of the ensemble cast.

 

**Peter Busch-McGinley:** He is the main character of this series and starts book one at approximately 29 years old. He spent his childhood summers in the Fertile Valley working on his grandfather’s farm. He had ties to the land, giving to a ‘prodigal son’ vibe to this novel. Like many people in his situation, Peter left the small town to chase dreams in the city. He ultimately found that life to be unfulfilling and regretted those life decisions. The death of his grandfather, Grandpa Joe, was the impetuous for his return to the Fertile Valley. Peter seized the moment and returned to his roots, wanting to make a living in the valley. Luckily, he inherited the family farm and a million dollars. With things going badly for him in Max City and his struggle with his sex addiction, he sought a fresh beginning.

Those decisions were definitely affected by his desire to connect with the daughter he didn’t know that he had. Realistically, it was also partly to escape his sex addiction in the city. We learn through the course of this story that Peter’s sex addiction wasn’t truly an addiction, so much as his fertility gift not translating well outside of the Fertile Valley. Without the protection of the harvest goddess, he struggled to process the boon the goddess had gifted him.

During his time living in Max City, he dropped out of college because he was shiftless and didn’t know where he fit in the world. Having been accepted into higher education, we know that Peter has some level of intelligence. After leaving school, he made his living as an unlicensed handyman. That detail was key, making him a jack of all trades. Thus, Peter’s ability to run the farm and bring it back from the brink of decay seems plausible. Too often in literature, characters have skills that don’t make sense for their backstory. That isn’t the case with this novel.

Overall, there’s a lot to like about Peter. He seems like the kind of dude you’d want to hang out with. I’d love to meet him at Yvette’s Pub for a drink, which is something that I like about my main characters. He’s not Superman, but he’s a reliable man-next-door. Someone who does the right thing when the chips are down.

At first, Peter struggles with the Harvest Goddesses’ gifts. He was tasked with the quest to repopulate the valley. He was instructed to form a harem and make a lot of babies. Through his reluctance to be non-monogamous, we see that he wasn’t just a horn dog in it for the sex. Nope, he really did want a relationship with the women he was engaging in coitus with. It took him a little bit to understand that he could have both romance and sex with multiple women in this valley. I liked that about him. I also enjoyed his dynamic with the various fairies and pixies in the novel. His reluctance with them illustrated that, at his core, he was a standup dude.

**Harvest Goddess:** She’s the harvest goddess of the Fertile Valley with ties to her old name, Freya. She was brought to America by the Vikings, where her essence was trapped in one of her symbols of power. She stayed and made the valley her home. When her other Viking gods and goddesses faded away, she remained as simply the harvest goddess and specialized in fertility (human and nature). She’s trapped in this valley, but she seems content there. She maintains her presence via her statues, and sometimes comes to life in physical form to engage with the locals. Physically, she was the embodiment of feminine perfection and had the right curves in all of the best places. Birthing hips, ample breasts, you know… goddess things. It was hinted that she looks differently for different people, but we don’t know for sure. She was more of a peripheral but guiding player in this book, but I think we’ll see more of her in later novels.

**Queenie Luna:** She is the daughter of Liz, the Mineral Town mayor and the mother of Kylie Anne. She was Peter’s childhood romantic partner, and she had been in love with him since she was eight. She did keep his daughter from him at her mother’s request, so there are trust issues to overcome. There were larger things at play with that decision, given Peter’s role in the story, but I am trying to avoid spoilers. Even with all of that, I still liked her and was rooting for them. Physically, she has blond, shoulder length hair that she mainly keeps in a ponytail. Part of her country girl charm, I think. She has a curvy body, yet is described as slim, but with a loveable womanly shape. Her blue eyes never ceased to captivate Peter, when he wasn’t distracted by her other parts, that is. Her relationship with him felt equal parts old friends and old married couple. Except there was a lot of underlying tension from their past experience and shared history. As a father myself, I had a hard time with this character. Keeping Peter from his daughter for those 8 years is unconscionable to me. That is one big hurdle to overcome, but her redemption arc did a good job of rehabilitating her.

**Elizabeth “Liz” Luna:** She’s Queenie’s hot mother and Kylie’s grandmother. Curves in all of the right places, someone Peter self-described as having the peak feminine form. She’s the mayor of Mineral City and the high priestess of town’s church to the Harvest Goddess. She was a character that existed more in the periphery than on screen, so I’m not really sure what to make of her. But the mystery was fun, and I didn’t mind how she was portrayed.

**Missy Sanford:** She’s the daughter of Chelsea Sandford, who owns the town gym. She went to college out of the valley, but she returned to her roots upon graduation. Peter only remembered her as the skinny, pimply-faced teenager obsessed with aerobics DVDs, whom he used to babysit. She grew into her body, though, and was a super attractive woman who could be a fitness model. She is an online fitness guru and runs her mom’s gym, teaching exercise classes to the locals. She prefers to rock her toned body in yoga pants and sports bra, the “just from the gym” look is her schtick. Luckily, Peter doesn’t seem to mind. Her perfect face was sharp, with a clear complexion and a set of six-pack abs. One of her quirks is that she refers to Peter as ‘City Pete,’ because he’d always visit and return to Max City where he lived with his parents who’d left the valley. She’s obsessed with Peter and has been since she was a kid. He isn’t much older than her, but he babysat her when they were kids. She is about 24 as the novel starts and ready to chase her dream of being his housewife and spitting out a few kids for him. As a character, she was all sexy red flags and stalker vibes, but I liked it. She’s the first time I’ve seen trillions of green flags and trillions of red flags all at once in one love interest. Man, maybe I need therapy!

**Darlene Copeland:** She’s one of Peter’s women and has a dream of starting and running the Mineral City Museum. She had a crush on him as a kid, when he used to babysit her. Her brother Dale, however, hated Peter and thought he was no good. That didn’t stop Darlene from wanting Peter. She lives in a trailer and has some white trash tendencies, but in all of the best ways. She’s best friends with Missy, whom she experimented with as teenagers, though she didn’t like lesbian sex. They were just so starved of cocks, since few men lived in the city. She lived the off-grid life, well off-grid lite. As from her dream of Peter and a museum, she desperately wants to become one of the priestesses of the Harvest Goddess. As a character, she was a lot of fun, I liked the sassy ginger vibes she sent off. She’s a freckle-faced redhead, rocking the cute pig tails that accent her emerald-green eyes. She’s a skinny woman, with a petite frame and worries about her smaller bust. Peter, however, reassures her that her tits are a perfect mouthful. What I liked most about her was how down to earth she was and the opposite of materialistic. She’s equally at home cooking dinner around a campfire as she is eating in some fancy restaurant.

**Kylie Anne Luna:** She’s the 8-year-old daughter of Queenie and Peter. She was fun to see on screen, a breath of cute, childish antics. However, she was written more toddler than elementary school kid. That could be due to how she was voiced, or maybe not? Given how magical the valley is, this could work if they age slower there. We don’t know the extent of the valley’s effects, so I’ll defer judgement on that until book two.

**Becca Sue MacIntyre:** She’s the skinny goth girl who runs the Mineral City flower shop. She was a petite and like all of the women in the Fertile Valley, she’s more attractive than what’s good for her. There was a lot to say about her, but that would be spoilers, but let’s just say that her character arc was fun to watch and I’m looking forward to seeing her in book two.

**Cindy Clarkson:** She’s the daughter of Yvette Clarkson, who owns and runs the pub in Mineral City. That eating establishment is named after her and serves as the town gathering place. Cindy works at Yvette’s Pub as a jack of all trades; waitress, cook and delivery driver. She seems to have narcolepsy, which isn’t explained in the first novel, though I suspect that we’re going to see those answers in the second novel. It’s set up that I think that she’s going to join Peter’s harem, but that has not happened yet.

 

 

**Plot and Pacing**

First, let’s talk about the plot of this novel. It was very simple, the main character, Peter, has to go to the Fertile Valley and reproduce. He has to get his thing on with a bunch of women and make babies. But not with one woman, no, he must go and fertilize as many wombs as possible. And if that wasn’t fun enough, he must sexually service the fairies and pixies of the valley. In doing so, he empowers them to facilitate the quest to save the valley. But wait, there’s more! The sex with those magical beings also impowered him. That plus up to his RPG stats allowed him to maintain the farm he’d inherited. He was tasked with doing this by using old school methods and eschewing modern technology. Speaking of roleplaying games, this novel is set against the backdrop of a farming sim RPG. I found the entire premise or plot of this novel to be highly enjoyable. The stakes were low, but I was hooked from the first page.

Another consideration for this novel was its pacing. In that respect, these two authors really showed their skills. The plot was simple, but Virgil Knightley and Annabelle Hawthorne kept us engaged throughout the course of this story. At first, this book was about Peter re-engaging with his old girlfriend and his newly discovered daughter. Then the plot expanded outwards, as he met the various women Mineral City. Those townies were women he’d known tangentially during his childhood. From there, his tasks continually grew; he hunted for fairies and pixies to free, he farmed his land, and he improved his cabin. There was plenty of slice of life action, with intermissions for sex with everybody and normal action that resulted from the Dark Queen and Dale subplots. Those served to keep the story churning along. Overall, I thought that the authors killed it and made such a simple concept fun. It was nice to have such an enjoyable concept that was a relatively stress-free free read.

 

 

**Audiobook Quality**

I listened to the audiobook version of this novel, and it was perfectly done. I shouldn’t be surprised that Virgil Knightley and Royal Guard Publishing put together a Grade-A production. The narrators, Boise Blue and Aurora Bliss, did an amazing job. I’ve never listened to their works before, but they definitely go on the list of folks I’d listen to again! I don’t know if they’ve ever worked together before this series, but this felt natural. I really thought I was sitting around the coffee table, drink some good brews while my friends told me a kick-ass yarn. They did a good job of setting the mood and tone for the various parts of the story.

 

 

**Sizzle Factor**

Now, let’s dive into the reason we’re all here! Let’s talk about the sex scenes in this novel, of which there were several. They were unique from anything I’ve read so far, though others are more widely read in this genre than I am. The sex in this book was mostly between Peter and the various minuscule pixies and fairies that floated around the Fertile Valley. There were some coital engagements where they remained with their womanly forms, but they remained in their miniature sizes. They acted as almost a living flesh-light, or a cock sleave. It was weird, and not something that tickles my fancy, but the writing was well done. Even better, it created a sense of otherworldliness that lent itself to the idea that the valley was magical. There were a few times where Peter had relations with his human women, specifically Missy and Queenie, but those were experienced in less detail. I would almost rather have seen more between him and his humans, than him in the fairies. That said, the story was engaging enough that I didn’t really care, I was invested in Peter’s quest. Overall, I wouldn’t say that any of this was extremely sizzle worthy, but it wasn’t horrific either. In that respect, it was a wash for me. Not a negative, not a positive, just a neutral. But, let me reiterate, the scenes that were there were well written. I know that many readers found them to be hotter than the surface of the sun!

 

 

**Overall**

First, I’ll open that I listened to this book instead of reading it on page or screen. The audiobook narrators were amazing and made the book really pop for me. The entire time I was taking my nature walks; I had a smile on my face from the sheer enjoyment of this novel. This was one of the most enjoyable listening experiences that I’ve had in a long time. I can’t say that any more strongly, I loved this book, and I think you will too.

 

The first thing that I noticed about this novel was how well-written the prose is. Normally, my own writing style is very workmanlike, and I appreciate that in others. Sometimes authors try to impress me with their verbiage, to the point where it felt like they were abusing their thesaurus. That was not the case here. This book felt very much like we were reading a book written by someone with an extensive vocabulary. When these two authors used words that I’d never heard before, it felt natural. Yeah, I had to look up a few of them but I didn’t mind at all. These two definitely made me want to restart those word of the day challenges I did in college. I need to catch up with Virgil and Annabelle, increasing my vocabulary past the four-letter words I learned in the Army.

 

Another thing that I enjoyed about this novel were the place names they used for everything. The main location was Fertile Valley with the two cities being Mineral City and Max City. They were so generically anime/videogame-esq that I didn’t have to take the story too seriously. It also meant we didn’t have the stress of placing the story anywhere specific on the globe. Even better, the names made me smile when I heard it the first time. Maybe even a slight chuckle, but shh, that’s a secret. I normally prefer more serious plots and locations, but it worked for the tone of this novel, and I was there for it!

 

Moving on, another thing that I noticed in this novel was the amount of winking that the girls in this these books do. I’ve realized that it must be Virgil thing, because you see winking and biting in almost everything he produces. That, and some blushing on the girls. Not a complaint though, I don’t mind! At this point, when I read his books, I start looking for them like I’m hunting for Easter Eggs!

 

One thing that I really enjoyed about this book was how relaxed everything felt. This was a thoroughly enjoyable novel, it almost felt like a harem equivalent of the cozy mystery as a setting. That doesn’t mean that the cast wasn’t varied, because I felt like we had a diversity of character archetypes. The plot felt laid-back, and I was there for it. No explosions that would in the world, no dragons trying to eat people, just a dude getting his nut off and making some babies to save the valley. I can’t wait for the book 2 audiobook to come out! I really should start banking money now, because at this rate Virgil Knightley is going to bankrupt me!

 

To wrap this book review up, I want to impart on you all that Fertile Valley Book 1 was the perfect combination of a farming and dating simulation that is intermixed with the witty humor that Virgil and Annabelle deliver. More than the humor, there was plenty of the fluffy goodness that will bring a smile to your face. This slice of life adventure was interesting, and I loved the characters. I think you will too, so give this book a chance!

 

There’s so much more I’d like to say about this book, but we don’t allow spoilers to slip through our spear line. So, with that… I’ll wrap this one up and put it to bed. As we close, I’d like to request that if you loved this book too, go over to Amazon and leave a review. This is a small thing, but it really does help authors find visibility in the algorithms that rule us all. Since I’m hooked on this genre, I want the creators I’m growing to love to be able to give us more of this literary crack that’s piped straight into my earholes!

I see a lot of posts on here about how to get a job. I’m going to give you some basic info. I realize this won’t apply to every firm or every job so take it fwiw. 

1) The higher degree, the better your chances. At our firm, for biotech and chem, a PhD is required. Elec and ME not as much, but still makes a difference. 

2) Any IP experience matters. Internships, volunteer work, etc. will distinguish you. We look for people who worked in a university TTO, or worked at the USPTO, or even spent a summer volunteering for a company working with their IP. If you give me your CV and tell me you are interested in patent law but have literally never been exposed to it, I am not going to hire you. Period. 

3) Patent bar helps (a lot) but isn’t a deal breaker. If you have no experience in IP, this can be somewhat mitigated by taking the patent bar and passing it. But we have no problem hiring patent professionals who haven’t taken the bar if they have some IP experience. 

4) Who you know absolutely matters. Network. In my city, there are regular cocktail hours for IP professionals. They are open to the public. I would highly recommend this. Also, just email people at firms you want to work in and ask them to meet you for coffee near their office. Tell them in the email you admire their career and would like to find out more. I get this request occasionally and I enjoy mentoring people so I am always up for it when I have time. Twice now I have ended up hiring the person that reached out to me. 

5) Final thought- this career isn’t for everyone. Not everyone likes it, and not everyone is good at it.  Don’t put all your eggs into the IP basket until you’ve tested the waters. I have had too many people make being a patent agent the sole focus of their life, only to get into it and not be able to cut it. It’s hard. It requires  certain personality and brain capacity that frankly not everyone has. Get some experience with it before you make up your mind it’s for you. 

By the way, we aren’t currently hiring so don’t ask. We also don’t hire WFM. ",22,1737389992.0,patentlaw,12,0.92,False

Like many people in his situation, Peter left the small town to chase dreams in the city. He ultimately found that life to be unfulfilling and regretted those life decisions. The death of his grandfather, Grandpa Joe, was the impetuous for his return to the Fertile Valley. Peter seized the moment and returned to his roots, wanting to make a living in the valley. Luckily, he inherited the family farm and a million dollars. With things going badly for him in Max City and his struggle with his sex addiction, he sought a fresh beginning.

Those decisions were definitely affected by his desire to connect with the daughter he didn’t know that he had. Realistically, it was also partly to escape his sex addiction in the city. We learn through the course of this story that Peter’s sex addiction wasn’t truly an addiction, so much as his fertility gift not translating well outside of the Fertile Valley. Without the protection of the harvest goddess, he struggled to process the boon the goddess had gifted him.

During his time living in Max City, he dropped out of college because he was shiftless and didn’t know where he fit in the world. Having been accepted into higher education, we know that Peter has some level of intelligence. After leaving school, he made his living as an unlicensed handyman. That detail was key, making him a jack of all trades. Thus, Peter’s ability to run the farm and bring it back from the brink of decay seems plausible. Too often in literature, characters have skills that don’t make sense for their backstory. That isn’t the case with this novel.

Overall, there’s a lot to like about Peter. He seems like the kind of dude you’d want to hang out with. I’d love to meet him at Yvette’s Pub for a drink, which is something that I like about my main characters. He’s not Superman, but he’s a reliable man-next-door. Someone who does the right thing when the chips are down.

At first, Peter struggles with the Harvest Goddesses’ gifts. He was tasked with the quest to repopulate the valley. He was instructed to form a harem and make a lot of babies. Through his reluctance to be non-monogamous, we see that he wasn’t just a horn dog in it for the sex. Nope, he really did want a relationship with the women he was engaging in coitus with. It took him a little bit to understand that he could have both romance and sex with multiple women in this valley. I liked that about him. I also enjoyed his dynamic with the various fairies and pixies in the novel. His reluctance with them illustrated that, at his core, he was a standup dude.

**Harvest Goddess:** She’s the harvest goddess of the Fertile Valley with ties to her old name, Freya. She was brought to America by the Vikings, where her essence was trapped in one of her symbols of power. She stayed and made the valley her home. When her other Viking gods and goddesses faded away, she remained as simply the harvest goddess and specialized in fertility (human and nature). She’s trapped in this valley, but she seems content there. She maintains her presence via her statues, and sometimes comes to life in physical form to engage with the locals. Physically, she was the embodiment of feminine perfection and had the right curves in all of the best places. Birthing hips, ample breasts, you know… goddess things. It was hinted that she looks differently for different people, but we don’t know for sure. She was more of a peripheral but guiding player in this book, but I think we’ll see more of her in later novels.

**Queenie Luna:** She is the daughter of Liz, the Mineral Town mayor and the mother of Kylie Anne. She was Peter’s childhood romantic partner, and she had been in love with him since she was eight. She did keep his daughter from him at her mother’s request, so there are trust issues to overcome. There were larger things at play with that decision, given Peter’s role in the story, but I am trying to avoid spoilers. Even with all of that, I still liked her and was rooting for them. Physically, she has blond, shoulder length hair that she mainly keeps in a ponytail. Part of her country girl charm, I think. She has a curvy body, yet is described as slim, but with a loveable womanly shape. Her blue eyes never ceased to captivate Peter, when he wasn’t distracted by her other parts, that is. Her relationship with him felt equal parts old friends and old married couple. Except there was a lot of underlying tension from their past experience and shared history. As a father myself, I had a hard time with this character. Keeping Peter from his daughter for those 8 years is unconscionable to me. That is one big hurdle to overcome, but her redemption arc did a good job of rehabilitating her.

**Elizabeth “Liz” Luna:** She’s Queenie’s hot mother and Kylie’s grandmother. Curves in all of the right places, someone Peter self-described as having the peak feminine form. She’s the mayor of Mineral City and the high priestess of town’s church to the Harvest Goddess. She was a character that existed more in the periphery than on screen, so I’m not really sure what to make of her. But the mystery was fun, and I didn’t mind how she was portrayed.

**Missy Sanford:** She’s the daughter of Chelsea Sandford, who owns the town gym. She went to college out of the valley, but she returned to her roots upon graduation. Peter only remembered her as the skinny, pimply-faced teenager obsessed with aerobics DVDs, whom he used to babysit. She grew into her body, though, and was a super attractive woman who could be a fitness model. She is an online fitness guru and runs her mom’s gym, teaching exercise classes to the locals. She prefers to rock her toned body in yoga pants and sports bra, the “just from the gym” look is her schtick. Luckily, Peter doesn’t seem to mind. Her perfect face was sharp, with a clear complexion and a set of six-pack abs. One of her quirks is that she refers to Peter as ‘City Pete,’ because he’d always visit and return to Max City where he lived with his parents who’d left the valley. She’s obsessed with Peter and has been since she was a kid. He isn’t much older than her, but he babysat her when they were kids. She is about 24 as the novel starts and ready to chase her dream of being his housewife and spitting out a few kids for him. As a character, she was all sexy red flags and stalker vibes, but I liked it. She’s the first time I’ve seen trillions of green flags and trillions of red flags all at once in one love interest. Man, maybe I need therapy!

**Darlene Copeland:** She’s one of Peter’s women and has a dream of starting and running the Mineral City Museum. She had a crush on him as a kid, when he used to babysit her. Her brother Dale, however, hated Peter and thought he was no good. That didn’t stop Darlene from wanting Peter. She lives in a trailer and has some white trash tendencies, but in all of the best ways. She’s best friends with Missy, whom she experimented with as teenagers, though she didn’t like lesbian sex. They were just so starved of cocks, since few men lived in the city. She lived the off-grid life, well off-grid lite. As from her dream of Peter and a museum, she desperately wants to become one of the priestesses of the Harvest Goddess. As a character, she was a lot of fun, I liked the sassy ginger vibes she sent off. She’s a freckle-faced redhead, rocking the cute pig tails that accent her emerald-green eyes. She’s a skinny woman, with a petite frame and worries about her smaller bust. Peter, however, reassures her that her tits are a perfect mouthful. What I liked most about her was how down to earth she was and the opposite of materialistic. She’s equally at home cooking dinner around a campfire as she is eating in some fancy restaurant.

**Kylie Anne Luna:** She’s the 8-year-old daughter of Queenie and Peter. She was fun to see on screen, a breath of cute, childish antics. However, she was written more toddler than elementary school kid. That could be due to how she was voiced, or maybe not? Given how magical the valley is, this could work if they age slower there. We don’t know the extent of the valley’s effects, so I’ll defer judgement on that until book two.

**Becca Sue MacIntyre:** She’s the skinny goth girl who runs the Mineral City flower shop. She was a petite and like all of the women in the Fertile Valley, she’s more attractive than what’s good for her. There was a lot to say about her, but that would be spoilers, but let’s just say that her character arc was fun to watch and I’m looking forward to seeing her in book two.

**Cindy Clarkson:** She’s the daughter of Yvette Clarkson, who owns and runs the pub in Mineral City. That eating establishment is named after her and serves as the town gathering place. Cindy works at Yvette’s Pub as a jack of all trades; waitress, cook and delivery driver. She seems to have narcolepsy, which isn’t explained in the first novel, though I suspect that we’re going to see those answers in the second novel. It’s set up that I think that she’s going to join Peter’s harem, but that has not happened yet.

 

 

**Plot and Pacing**

First, let’s talk about the plot of this novel. It was very simple, the main character, Peter, has to go to the Fertile Valley and reproduce. He has to get his thing on with a bunch of women and make babies. But not with one woman, no, he must go and fertilize as many wombs as possible. And if that wasn’t fun enough, he must sexually service the fairies and pixies of the valley. In doing so, he empowers them to facilitate the quest to save the valley. But wait, there’s more! The sex with those magical beings also impowered him. That plus up to his RPG stats allowed him to maintain the farm he’d inherited. He was tasked with doing this by using old school methods and eschewing modern technology. Speaking of roleplaying games, this novel is set against the backdrop of a farming sim RPG. I found the entire premise or plot of this novel to be highly enjoyable. The stakes were low, but I was hooked from the first page.

Another consideration for this novel was its pacing. In that respect, these two authors really showed their skills. The plot was simple, but Virgil Knightley and Annabelle Hawthorne kept us engaged throughout the course of this story. At first, this book was about Peter re-engaging with his old girlfriend and his newly discovered daughter. Then the plot expanded outwards, as he met the various women Mineral City. Those townies were women he’d known tangentially during his childhood. From there, his tasks continually grew; he hunted for fairies and pixies to free, he farmed his land, and he improved his cabin. There was plenty of slice of life action, with intermissions for sex with everybody and normal action that resulted from the Dark Queen and Dale subplots. Those served to keep the story churning along. Overall, I thought that the authors killed it and made such a simple concept fun. It was nice to have such an enjoyable concept that was a relatively stress-free free read.

 

 

**Audiobook Quality**

I listened to the audiobook version of this novel, and it was perfectly done. I shouldn’t be surprised that Virgil Knightley and Royal Guard Publishing put together a Grade-A production. The narrators, Boise Blue and Aurora Bliss, did an amazing job. I’ve never listened to their works before, but they definitely go on the list of folks I’d listen to again! I don’t know if they’ve ever worked together before this series, but this felt natural. I really thought I was sitting around the coffee table, drink some good brews while my friends told me a kick-ass yarn. They did a good job of setting the mood and tone for the various parts of the story.

 

 

**Sizzle Factor**

Now, let’s dive into the reason we’re all here! Let’s talk about the sex scenes in this novel, of which there were several. They were unique from anything I’ve read so far, though others are more widely read in this genre than I am. The sex in this book was mostly between Peter and the various minuscule pixies and fairies that floated around the Fertile Valley. There were some coital engagements where they remained with their womanly forms, but they remained in their miniature sizes. They acted as almost a living flesh-light, or a cock sleave. It was weird, and not something that tickles my fancy, but the writing was well done. Even better, it created a sense of otherworldliness that lent itself to the idea that the valley was magical. There were a few times where Peter had relations with his human women, specifically Missy and Queenie, but those were experienced in less detail. I would almost rather have seen more between him and his humans, than him in the fairies. That said, the story was engaging enough that I didn’t really care, I was invested in Peter’s quest. Overall, I wouldn’t say that any of this was extremely sizzle worthy, but it wasn’t horrific either. In that respect, it was a wash for me. Not a negative, not a positive, just a neutral. But, let me reiterate, the scenes that were there were well written. I know that many readers found them to be hotter than the surface of the sun!

 

 

**Overall**

First, I’ll open that I listened to this book instead of reading it on page or screen. The audiobook narrators were amazing and made the book really pop for me. The entire time I was taking my nature walks; I had a smile on my face from the sheer enjoyment of this novel. This was one of the most enjoyable listening experiences that I’ve had in a long time. I can’t say that any more strongly, I loved this book, and I think you will too.

 

The first thing that I noticed about this novel was how well-written the prose is. Normally, my own writing style is very workmanlike, and I appreciate that in others. Sometimes authors try to impress me with their verbiage, to the point where it felt like they were abusing their thesaurus. That was not the case here. This book felt very much like we were reading a book written by someone with an extensive vocabulary. When these two authors used words that I’d never heard before, it felt natural. Yeah, I had to look up a few of them but I didn’t mind at all. These two definitely made me want to restart those word of the day challenges I did in college. I need to catch up with Virgil and Annabelle, increasing my vocabulary past the four-letter words I learned in the Army.

 

Another thing that I enjoyed about this novel were the place names they used for everything. The main location was Fertile Valley with the two cities being Mineral City and Max City. They were so generically anime/videogame-esq that I didn’t have to take the story too seriously. It also meant we didn’t have the stress of placing the story anywhere specific on the globe. Even better, the names made me smile when I heard it the first time. Maybe even a slight chuckle, but shh, that’s a secret. I normally prefer more serious plots and locations, but it worked for the tone of this novel, and I was there for it!

 

Moving on, another thing that I noticed in this novel was the amount of winking that the girls in this these books do. I’ve realized that it must be Virgil thing, because you see winking and biting in almost everything he produces. That, and some blushing on the girls. Not a complaint though, I don’t mind! At this point, when I read his books, I start looking for them like I’m hunting for Easter Eggs!

 

One thing that I really enjoyed about this book was how relaxed everything felt. This was a thoroughly enjoyable novel, it almost felt like a harem equivalent of the cozy mystery as a setting. That doesn’t mean that the cast wasn’t varied, because I felt like we had a diversity of character archetypes. The plot felt laid-back, and I was there for it. No explosions that would in the world, no dragons trying to eat people, just a dude getting his nut off and making some babies to save the valley. I can’t wait for the book 2 audiobook to come out! I really should start banking money now, because at this rate Virgil Knightley is going to bankrupt me!

 

To wrap this book review up, I want to impart on you all that Fertile Valley Book 1 was the perfect combination of a farming and dating simulation that is intermixed with the witty humor that Virgil and Annabelle deliver. More than the humor, there was plenty of the fluffy goodness that will bring a smile to your face. This slice of life adventure was interesting, and I loved the characters. I think you will too, so give this book a chance!

 

There’s so much more I’d like to say about this book, but we don’t allow spoilers to slip through our spear line. So, with that… I’ll wrap this one up and put it to bed. As we close, I’d like to request that if you loved this book too, go over to Amazon and leave a review. This is a small thing, but it really does help authors find visibility in the algorithms that rule us all. Since I’m hooked on this genre, I want the creators I’m growing to love to be able to give us more of this literary crack that’s piped straight into my earholes!

1i5tw0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1i5tw0z/he_threw_a_cup_at_me/,He Threw A Cup At Me! ,"Okay, so here's another story from my time working at the very popular theme park in Florida. This incident is one that almost made me quit. I was working as a cashier at the bakery store area of the resort I worked at. It was really busy and my line was long. I was a fast cashier so I was moving through the guests quickly. I hear an older man and woman arguing with each other as they come up through my line. I mind my business as I ring up their things. The man says with an attitude that he needs a cup for coffee. I grab one, sit it on the counter and ring it up with the rest of their things. 

I tell them their total and they pull out their room card to pay. Room cards were connected to guest's IDs and guest could also connect a debit or credit card to them to make things easier during their vacation. I go through the process of charging the card but the computer won't read it. I do it multiple times and still nothing. 

Older woman: This is the second card that's doing this! 

Older man: Well what am I supposed to do about it?! She's the one that doesn't know what she's doing! (Referring to me)

Me: 😳, Um sir, do you have the debit or credit card associated with the room card? I can just use that. 

Older man: IF I HAD THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE HANDED YOU THE ROOM KEY! WHY CAN'T YOU DO YOUR JOB!

At this point I'm trying to calm down and remain not ignorant. 

A nice guest behind the man chimes in and says to the older gentleman that if its happened two times already it's probably because they are putting it next to their cell phone or something else that is demagnetizing it because it happened to him as well. 

Older man to nice young gentleman: WHO ASKED YOU! 

The young man raises his hand and says sorry sarcastically while other guest look at the older couple like their nuts and look at me with sympathy. 

Me: Sir, ma'am, do you have another form of payment? 

The man throws the stuff they had angrily on the counter and his wife follows knocking the cup on the ground. Some people leave the line. The welcome desk ladies some feet behind me stare on in bewilderment. 

Older man: I don't even want this crap anymore! All I wanted was a coffee!

Me wanting them to just leave my line and my nerves: Here, I'll give you the coffee for free. 

I hand him another cup which he attempts to snatch causing this one to also drop to the ground. He picks it up angrily and throws it at me! 

Older man: I NEED ANOTHER ONE! 

Y'all, I'm shaking. What I'm feeling at that moment wasn't anger, it was wrath. I'm brown but my face and neck were red. I then understood why God didn't give humans superpowers because I would have reduced that entire place to ashes starting with the older couple. Everything would have gone up in flames. I grabbed another cup and sat it on the counter. Before handing it to the man I calmly spoke to him. 

Me: Sir, instead of acting like this, all you had to do was ask. You see that desk behind me? They can print you a new card if you need it...

Him and his wife seemed to deflate but said nothing as I handed him the cup. I then asked them to leave my line and they walked away. The nice man and his woman looked at me with pity and the woman said she was sorry I had to go through that. I managed to ring up their things but couldn't continue so I called my manager on the phone that was next to the cash register. She answered and instantly knew by my voice something was wrong. I told her I needed a break. I couldn't be there right now. She said okay and she was on the way. She came out a minute later and told me to take a breather. 

I couldn't even make it to the worker break room bathroom before the tears started so I ran to the guest bathroom into a stall and cried there. I cried not because I was sad but because I was angry and had to suppress it. I was boiling over like a pot of water on the inside. Throughout that week no matter where I saw that man and his wife I gave them the nastiest stank eye I could muster up. Suddenly, they were super nice to everyone else, refused to make eye contact with me longer than a few seconds and they never apologized though they looked guilty whenever they saw me.
