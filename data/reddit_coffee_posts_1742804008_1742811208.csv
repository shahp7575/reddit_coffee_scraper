1jin8n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1jin8n4/jealous_brother_wants_to_control_me_and_it_is/,Jealous Brother Wants to Control Me and it is Getting Creepy,"My brother is younger than me by 3 years. I noticed he was self-absorbed but I didn't realize he had been competing against me our whole lives. I didn't get the memo. I'm autistic so while I can logically understand someone's view, I don't always pick up on social cues. 

Anyways, about 2 years ago I got pregnant. When we told my brother, his response was ""You beat us!""Immediately after that, he and his wife started trying to concieve (as in the next cycle) and my brother freaked out when it didn't happen right away (as in the first cycle). Before this time, they weren't trying to get pregnant. They are still trying but now trying with medical intervention. 

Recently, my husband and I have been trying to start a business. We live frugally so we can put our savings towards our business. We asked for my brother's help and he told us we should sell our house and our car. For clarity, our home pays for itself with tenants and even without them, it would cost more to rent an apartment. However, there is equity in our home - that is true. He also refused to cosign a HELOC unless he could use it to pay for his wife's fertility treatments (~70k). Before he looked into the fertility treatment cost, he told us no because he needed to prioritize his wife's fertility treatments because she's almost 39 and cosigning with us could impact his ability to take out a fertility treatment loan. 

My brother wants to ""help"" me get a job in his industry by having me do exactly as he says and working exactly where he says. He badmouths other jobs I'm interested in and what my experience is in all while boasting about his job and his experience. 

He accepted a job near me in an area that I legit thought was a good fit for him. He and his wife were pleased with the area and he loves his job at first. Now, there's some issue with his work contract and he's complaining about the apartments in his area. Here is where it starts getting weird. He all of a sudden is saying that he doesn't like his side of town because my side of town is better and he really likes a city close to me. When we had originally moved to our neighborhood, my brother told us it wasn't good and the house wasn't going to retain its value, neither of which turned out to be true. 

My husband and I have an entrepreneur mindset and my brother can be one but seems to do better with a regular paycheck. He isn't good at saving money and tends to spend his paycheck, to the best of my knowledge, on eating out, travel, and coffee. Not judging - those are his values. But I don't understand why he is acting jealous of how my husband and I have invested our money when he has actually made more over the same time period and chooses to spend his paycheck rather than saving or investing it. 

What can I do? I dont want to be mean, but I don't see any other way other than going low or no contact with him. I'm concerned how it will impact my relationship with my mom because my brother comes first a over all her other relationships and caused issues in the past with her significant others. At the end of the day, he's my brother but I'm starting to feel psychologically unsafe around him. Who knows how long until he becomes mentally unstable and lashes out at me physically. Am I right to be concerned or am I overreacting? ",1,1742811027.0,Manipulation,0,1.0,False

Morning light that was too gentle for the world we lived in

The kind of soft sunlight that falls on closed eyelids and makes you believe in beginngs



She stood there

Yellow dress

Railing pressed into her back

Her eyes searching the sky like it had answers.

And me

On her right

Leanning forward on the table

Sipping cold coffee I never tasted



I remember the wind.

It was light,

Like a whisper trouhgh leaves.

Like breath before a confession.



And then she turned

Her gaze left the sky

It fell on me

And I swear, for that moment

I forgot how to breathe



She said,

""I can possibly never stop loving you.""

No trembling

No doubt

Just truth

Like it had always been there, waiting for her lips to find it



I said something back.

Something about how even the thought of forgetting her

was so violent

that it destroyed itself before it could finish forming

I don't remember the words

I only remember how it felt

Like falling

without fear of landing



But spring does not last.



Another spring is here now

And she is not

She left

Without anger,

Without explanation,

Without turning around



And I...

I still haven't broken that promise.

I still can‚Äôt.

Because some promises aren‚Äôt chains

they're graves.

And I buried myself in mine.



So I return.

Every night

To that rooftop in my mind

The coffee never warms

The wind never stops singing her name

The clouds never come down far enough for me to touch



And I stand there

Stomach pressed against nothing

Cold coffee trembling in my hand

Eyes stuck between her face and the sky she once searched



Because if I said I wouldn‚Äôt leave

If I said I couldn‚Äôt forget

Then I stay



Exactly where she left me



I live there now

Alone

In an eternal spring

That never blossoms

Only rots.",1,1742810480.0,TeenIndia,0,1.0,False
1jin3ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1jin3ov/puppy_acting_different_for_the_last_day/,Puppy acting different for the last day,"My pup had a wild weekend. She spent a day with her sitter since we weren‚Äôt home and I picked her up Sunday morning. We went for a walk and a coffee with the sitter and her nephew, and she stole a bit of chocolate cake pop from the child. I monitored her for the rest of the day and was ready to take her to the emergency vet if necessary.

When we got home, she spent the whole afternoon sleeping, way more than usual. I was guessing it was either tiredness, or maybe even teething or growth spurt since she just hit 14 week mark on Friday. She was playful when awake, ate her meals normally and drank water.

She woke me up at 5am with sounding like she might vomit, but she didn‚Äôt, just went back to sleep till 8am. She ate her breakfast but she started begging for more food soon after. At 10 am, I gave her two banana wheels and a few blueberries (she only had blueberries for the second time). 30 minutes later, she vomited, 24 hours after eating chocolate cake pop. I don‚Äôt know if it was related to itor not. Her poop was normal the whole time.

Today she is much more playful again, biting at everyone and everything, running around, barking playfully. She is actually much more bitey than usual and actively looking for something to chew on. She whined after vomiting, I‚Äôm guessing because her stomach was empty. 

She seems perfectly fine now, wild as usual, but I‚Äôm still kinda worried.

I don't just mean a few bits scattered around, I mean you will find plates in the bed, dirty socks all over the house, piles and piles of clothes and trinkets because she has run out of space. You have to step over stuff to get anywhere in her house. She owns a lot of stuff so its magnified. She has 2 kids and 3 dogs. But who cares because its her house and she loves her life.

The issue is, there is dog hair everywhere. In the kitchen, the surfaces are covered in dog hair, it is all over the kids toys and you are covered in it when you leave. The house also smells like dog. Again, not my life, so not my concern - except she always thoughtfully makes me dishes that she thinks I will like. On more than one occasion, I have found dog hair in my coffee cup and in the food she has served. The last time i went to see L, I said ""Honestly you dont need to worry about feeding me - it's just so nice to see you"" (Any working parent will know how hard it actually is to get schedules to co-ordinate).

Here is where I might be the asshole - she came round to see me last week and bought some food she had made. I didn't have the heart or stomach to eat it because I know the state of the kitchen, but after lots of excuses (e.g. I wasnt hungry, trying to be healthy, picking but not eating), I think she realised and said I was being really rude. I tried to gently respond by saying that I love her, and I know life is busy, but I had eaten food with dog hair in it when she had previously prepared something. She called me mean, started crying and left.

Hi all,  

I have worked in a small independent coffee shop for about 6 months now, and the owner doesn‚Äôt give staff breaks at all, even on long shifts. There are also many other issues with how they run things. (england)

I recently got a new job that requires me to start very suddenly, meaning I was only able to give 8 days' notice. I checked my contract (if you can even call it that), and the only mention of a notice period is that I must give 3 weeks‚Äô notice *for holiday*. There is nothing about a notice period for leaving the job entirely.  

The owner is now saying that if I don‚Äôt stay, they will have to dock my pay. Can they legally do this? And is there anything I can do about the lack of breaks?

Well last week I just bought a new bag, roasted 2 weeks earlier and it fully blocked my machine, to get coffee to come out, I needed to adjust my grinder (DF54) pretty substantially to a much coarser setting. The coffee tasted as it normally does for this bean, so I didn't think much of it until the last couple of days.

Now at the new grind setting, the espresso is FLYING out of the machine (sub 15sec extraction) and after going through a fresh dialling in process, I've ended up back at the original grind setting I've had for this bean for the last few months.

1jimxa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RSI/comments/1jimxa9/ulnar_wrist_pain_for_4_years/,Ulnar Wrist Pain for 4 years.,"Hello everyone, I'm seeking advice for dealing with a suspected TFCC injury.

The pain occurs when my hand is moved laterally, whether in the neutral position, pronated or supinated. I get the pain when I just moved my hand whether to write, (which I can't do anymore!), or to stir my scrambled eggs, wash up a pan, open a door or lift any sort of weight.

It initially happened 4 years ago now when I was attacked in the street and had a fight. I went home and realised I could not bear any weight on my left hand in it's neutral position (like holding a mug off coffee). Annoyingly, I rebroke my right hand in the process so I overlooked my left hand wrist injury.  The pain in my left wrist went after a few days to a week so I thought it was a wrist sprain. The pain never came back from what I can remember. Fast forward 6 months I got a manual labour job (I was at university). During my shifts, I would experience slight pain again and after my shifts the pain would be worse. Then, I'd wake up the next day and be pain free until I work again. Whilst I was at university I was working part time so I only worked 2-3 times a week so the pain would never get that bad. After university I went full time, and I had excruciating pain 24/7. Even moving my hand causes extreme pain, which I never had before. I struggle to hold my fork to eat my dinner if I had used my left hand that day. I have been off work since the end of October, with the pain not subsiding even whilst not using my hand. All I do day-to-day to type, eat etc (no weight bearing, no writing etc), but the pain has not changed since I last worked.

I went to my GP to explain the issue. He said it is likely a TFCC tear but booked in an xray to confirm no fractures (xray was all clear). I then was referred to the hand physio team who said it is definitely a TFCC tear but they could not replicate the pain through any exercises they performed on it. They said there is nothing they can do and I need hand surgery and referred me to orthopaedics. Orthopaedic hand surgeon booked me in for an MRI and I just got the result today which has came up with nothing, showing all muscle, tendon and cartilage to be intact. The hand surgeon said he has no idea what is up with my hand and has now booked me back in with the same physio in hopes they can diagnose me. Weirdly, the hand surgeon said ""I can perform surgery on your wrist, but with no clear indication of what it is it's a 60/40 chance of success"". Now, I do not understand how you can perform hand surgery if you have no idea what it is?? He's said physio for 3-4 months and if no difference I have an open appointment for surgery. I've now had enough of being fobbed off I guess and going around in circles since August so I'm asking for help if anyone else has had the same issue. Sadly I can't afford private healthcare so have to go through the NHS.

  
Sadly, my main hobby has always been bodybuilding, and with no weight bearing I have been unable to go to the gym since August time. Also, not being able to work is not great and just in general being unable to do anything is very demoralising and has left me feeling very rubbish.

‚Üí Total visible buy-side liquidity: 2,100+ BTC.

Big hands are clearly accumulating.

‚∏ª

What‚Äôs Next?

Break above 88K = door opens straight into 92K‚Äì94K liquidity zone.
We can already see signs of absorption and potential magnet action toward that level.

‚∏ª

Bonus Context:

We‚Äôre approaching Q1 and monthly close.
Funds often want green candles on the chart for investor reports ‚Äî and that typically means a bullish quarterly finish.

‚∏ª

Grizzly‚Äôs short note:

	‚Ä¢	Strong buy wall at 86K ‚Äî price well protected below
	‚Ä¢	Red zone at 88K acting as friction point ‚Äî but it‚Äôs artificial
	‚Ä¢	Breakout could trigger a fast move to 92‚Äì94K
	‚Ä¢	Quarterly close fuel might push us higher

‚∏ª

Sip your coffee, study the walls.

Online dictionaries suggest the words I'm looking for are *infusion* and *tisane*, but both of those are definitely from French, even if they pre-date ""tea"".

Technically ""wort-water"" or something makes sense, but it feels a bit clunky.

So I'm a software engineer working remotely, and I'm having a bit of a problem - my home just isn't cutting it as a workspace anymore. Too many distractions, not enough quiet, and my focus is really suffering because of it.

I'm on the hunt for somewhere peaceful to work near Motijheel metro station or anywhere that's easy to reach along the metro line. What I'm hoping to find is:

* Something like a library - quiet and chill
* Somewhere I can actually concentrate without constant interruptions
* WiFi would be nice but not mandatory (got my mobile data as backup)

A bunch of people have suggested coffee shops like Northend or Tabaaq, but honestly, I find them pretty distracting and none of them are nearby to my location. Plus, I'm not super keen on buying overpriced coffee just for a seat!

If anyone knows some good spots around here - maybe a library, affordable co-working space, or any quiet corner I haven't thought of - I'd really appreciate the tips!

I came back to my kitchen covered in milk, burnt milk at the bottom of the aeroccino and it looked like a milky bomb site. Milk way half way up the walls of the kitchen, the sides drenched in milk.  
  
I have no idea how this happened. Perhaps the timer didn't stop and it just kept heating until it boiled, and the pressure poped off the lid? I also think it's broken too, either the fuse is gone or something else as the lights no longer show on it. Has this happened to anyone else? I don't know how it's gone so badly wrong.

I think I made a bad impression, because my offer to join Mr\_V's coalition has been ignored. I hope this video will patch up our relationship, and lead to a new alliance

My family and I are looking to go a two week vacation to your amazing country and I‚Äôm looking to get feedback on what we‚Äôve planned. For context my family is myself, my wife, our 7 year old boy and our to be 9 to 12 month old at the time of the trip. At the moment we‚Äôre looking to do the following:

Day 1: Land in Brisbane - Jet lag (lol)

Day 2:  Brisbane- Museums, river walk, XXXX Brewery (I heard this is the real beer ozzies have)

Day 3: Gold Coast - Beach, Skypoint Tower 

Day 4: Gold Coast - Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, more beach lol 

Day 5: Rent A Car, Drive to Byron Bay - See Parkway Drive (carrion was our wedding song lol), Experience hippy culture, Stone and Wood Brewery and more beach. 

Day 6: Coffs Harbour - See the Big Banana (my son loves the Ozzie big things), more beach time

Day 7: travel - Spend the night in the Hunter Valley

Day 8: Hunter Valley - Hot Air Balloon, Enjoy the wineries and the Hunter Valley Gardens

Day 9:  Sydney - Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Tower and big bus Tour 

Day 10: Sydney - Taronga Zoo (we love zoos incase you couldn‚Äôt tell lol), Luna Park 

Day 10: Sydney - Catch a Super Rugby League Game (Go Panthers!), get a ferry to Manly and check it out. 

Day 11:  Blue Mountains - check out the three sisters and scenic world 

Day 12: Melbourne - Have the world famous coffee, check out the graffiti laneways

Day 13: Melbourne - catch a cricket match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground 

Day 14: Melbourne - go shopping, ride the trams


Is this itinerary possible? 


I also have a handful of questions as well:

1. How easy is it to get super rugby league tickets? Is there a resale platform or is it only access for season members? 

2. We were previously scheduled to go to England but no longer feel it would be safe for us as Americans given the current political climate. Will we be safe in Australia? Have any other Americans who have recently vacationed there had any issues? 

3. My Son loves that Australia has so many big things. Is there a map somewhere online so we can pack in as many as we can? 

4. We were looking at getting out of our comfort zone and trying some traditional Australian food. Is there anything we should try other than Vegemite and meat pies? Where is the best place to try aboriginal cuisine?

5. Is it hard to find a Nanny? We wanted to hire one for our kids while we adults had a date night at some point. 

6. Is there anywhere on our vacation where we can see animals in the wild? If not, can we easily detour to see them? We‚Äôd love to see anything, just no dingoes lol. 

7. I‚Äôve heard that Melbourne isn‚Äôt a very good city for tourists? Is that true? Is it better to spend more time somewhere else? 

8. We were told that Ozzie‚Äôs don‚Äôt like it when people refer to shrimp as shrimp. Are there any other cultural word differences we should know

My 18yr old brother tragically and unexpectedly passed away in October. It was traumatizing for my whole family and his new girlfriend (dating 4 months) as we all witnessed everything. 
I wasn‚Äôt super close with his new gf as they weren‚Äôt together long, until everything happened. After he passed, her and I got extremely close. Being with eachother 24/7, texting if not together, etc. unfortunately a lot of kids at the HS (my brother was a senior - she graduated last year) and their job (they both worked at the same coffee shop) were bullying her as they said she was being way too emotional for them not dating long. She was living 1hr away for university- dropped out of college, moved back home, left job in city and started working back home as well (where her and my brother used to work). 
I was extremely defensive of her, and this made us closer. 

two weeks after my brother passed, she started talking to her ex. She didn‚Äôt tell me, but I knew. Tbh I was salty at the time. I think the grief was strong and I was mad at everything. So I distanced myself. I do work over the road so I‚Äôm gone months at a time anyways. But we do not text as we used to.

Her and her ex, they‚Äôre still talking/together. But She still hides it from me, when she‚Äôs hanging out with him she will say she‚Äôs hanging out with her best friend and use she/her pronouns. Never referring to her best friend by name, etc. 
I did once bring up the fact someone said something about them being back together and she denied it - saying they don‚Äôt even talk. 

I still see her occasionally so it feels weird that everytime we talk there‚Äôs this secret and just weird energy. 
I want to reach out to her and tell her it‚Äôs okay. I understand and I will never be mad. But I don‚Äôt know I feel confused on how to address this. 

TLDR: my 18M brother passed away and his GF of 4mo is back with her ex and hiding it from me. (I assume she thinks I‚Äôll be mad). 

Needing advice on how to address this with her.

I received my unit about a week ago. Despite it's design flaws that every user already pointed out, I really enjoy using it. Finally I can have good quality espresso at home, and also I can play w the pressures around. The compactness is cool but it can be heavy to carry around all day. 
Sure there are bit if cracking sounds and it is wobbly but I could get over that, because it's quite stable when you're pressing down. And that's how you gonna use it anyways, I thought. But then, disaster happened. 
I was brewing coffee and finally managed to dial in my (quite limited quantity) coffee. It extracted perfectly. Good timing, good crema. 
But just as I was putting a drip cup under my machine, so that I can enjoy my fresh espresso in peace, I knocked my Flair over. The brew chamber fell and spilled all my coffee. 
So now I'm getting angry at the design.

She made all these plans to hangout on the coffee to spend time together. She hugged me twice before she left. Unfortunately, her texting has not been great.

1jimc4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1jimc4q/review_after_40_days_slightly_positive/,Review after 40 days : slightly positive,"Context : I discovered this subreddit by chance a few weeks ago, read dozens of topics, and thought : ""why not try !""

I'm a 40 yo dude, muscular-obese. 140kgs but I bicycle a lot, so I'm in rather good health despite my weight. I could be very different in a few years though.   
Also, I have a (very) sweet tooth. Probably exacerbated by the fact that I have a ridiculously low tolerance for bitter taste. For instance I have an instant cappuccino hot drink that I like. It's roughly 8% coffee, 60% sugar, and 30% powdered milk. Impossible to drink it like this : way too bitter. But if I add even more sugar and powdered milk, I love it. I also find alcohol utterly awful for that same reason.   
And so, I probably ate in average 300g of sugar per day, sometimes significantly more. Hence my decision to try and stop it. 

So I did, 40 days ago. I allow myself artificial sweetener and not too sugary fruits (mostly a bit green bananas  and apples, and 3 fruits per day in average). I try to cook more, to avoid all the already prepared food with pretty much always sugar on it. 

I made 3 exceptions :  

* Twice, for work I was invited somewhere, and had a dark chocolate muffin, to blend in. 
* Once, I tried a very small cappuccino, without my usual added sugar/milk, to see if I could like it like that. It was still awful.

My experience :  

* It was oddly easy to stop to eat sugar (and obivously, all similar stuff, like honey, maple sirup, etc.). I tried once or twice to reduce the amount of sugar I ate (to go from 300g/d to 150. But I failed, mainly because I had to ""be reasonnable"", and not eat/drink too much sugary stuff. Whereas here, I just don't allow anything (apart from fruits and artificial sweeteners). And for me, it's way easier to think ""I can't eat m&ms, so I can't buy them, and that's it"", than ""I can eat some, but I should stop after 10 !"" (and then usually I eat 500g of them in one sitting.
* I didn't have any significant effect, apart from one : no more brain fog (which is awesome, I hated that !). But otherwise, nothing, either positive or negative. But nothing related to better skin, more energy, or withdrawal effects.
* It kinda help lose some weight. I lost 2-3 kg. Not much but still. The main difference here, is that I feel I eat a lot, and still lose or stabilize weight. Whereas before, I felt I didn't eat much, and gained weight. I think it's mostly because I used to alternate sweet and non sweet stuff : I could eat a pizza, then my sweet tooth would crave something sweet, so I'd eat whatever sweet thing there was, then I craved something salty, and pizza it was again, etc.
* When I ate the muffins, I felt... Nothing. They were perhaps a tad sweeter than otherwise, but apart from that, no effects, and no cravings. 

So here was my experience, that differed a bit from what I read here. Sorry for the mistakes, english isn't my first language. 

Good luck to all of us in our sugarfree journey !

1jimc1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1jimc1g/wellamoon_review_reddit_does_it_actually_improve/,Wellamoon Review Reddit: Does It Actually Improve Sleep?,"I‚Äôve had **sleep issues for years**. Falling asleep takes forever, and when I finally do, I wake up multiple times a night. Melatonin pills sometimes worked, but I hated feeling groggy in the morning.

I started looking for alternatives and came across **Wellamoon sleep patches**. The idea of a **slow-release sleep patch** sounded interesting, so I decided to test it for a full month. Here‚Äôs my full experience‚Äîboth the good and the bad.

# What Is Wellamoon?

**Wellamoon sleep patches** are **transdermal patches** that slowly release sleep-supporting ingredients through the skin instead of the digestive system. Unlike pills, which can **hit your system all at once**, these patches work **gradually throughout the night**.

Each **Wellamoon sleeping patch** contains:

* **Melatonin (7mg)** ‚Äì Supports sleep-wake cycles.
* **Valerian Root (27mg)** ‚Äì Helps with relaxation and stress relief.
* **Hops (16.53mg)** ‚Äì Known for its calming properties.
* **Magnesium Malate (41.32mg)** ‚Äì Aids in muscle relaxation and deeper sleep.

To use it, you **apply the patch to a clean, hairless area** (like your arm, thigh, or shoulder) about **an hour before bed**. It stays on all night and is removed in the morning.

If you want more details, here‚Äôs where I got mine: [**Wellamoon Sleep Patch Info**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2J8ZH9TQ/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# First Impressions ‚Äì Did It Work Right Away?

I wasn‚Äôt expecting much on the **first night**, but I followed the instructions and applied the **Wellamoon sleeping patch** to my shoulder.

At first, I didn‚Äôt feel anything, but after **30 minutes**, I started noticing a sense of calm. I didn‚Äôt feel drugged or knocked out‚Äîjust **more relaxed than usual**.

I fell asleep in **about 20-25 minutes**, which was faster than my usual 45+ minutes. The big surprise was that I **didn‚Äôt wake up multiple times** like I normally do.

By the end of the first week, I noticed:

* Falling asleep was **faster and easier**.
* I stayed asleep longer.
* No morning grogginess, unlike melatonin pills.

# Weeks 2-3 ‚Äì Is It Consistent?

By the second and third weeks, the effects were **more noticeable**. I found that on the nights I used **Wellamoon sleep patches**, I:

* **Fell asleep within 15-20 minutes** instead of tossing and turning.
* Had **fewer middle-of-the-night wake-ups**.
* Woke up **feeling more rested**.

Even on nights when I skipped the patch, I **still fell asleep faster than before**. It seemed like my body was adjusting to a better rhythm.

# Week 4 ‚Äì Long-Term Effects and Final Thoughts

By the **fourth week**, I didn‚Äôt feel like I needed to use **Wellamoon sleep patches** every night anymore. My **sleep schedule had improved**, and I wasn‚Äôt struggling to fall asleep like I used to.

Some things I noticed after a month:

* Sleep felt **deeper and more consistent**.
* I had **more daytime energy** and didn‚Äôt feel the need for extra coffee.
* My **mood improved**, probably from better sleep.

If you‚Äôre curious about trying it, here‚Äôs where I found mine: [**Wellamoon Sleep Patch Details**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2J8ZH9TQ/?uid=34563&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# Is Wellamoon Worth Trying?

**Wellamoon sleep patches** won‚Äôt work for everyone, but they helped me:

* **Fall asleep faster**.
* **Stay asleep longer**.
* **Wake up feeling refreshed instead of groggy**.

They‚Äôre not an instant fix, but they **gradually improved my sleep over time**. If you have **mild to moderate sleep issues**, they might be worth trying.

1jima6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jima6r/wibtah_if_i_told_my_crush_we_can_no_longer_be/,WIBTAH if I told my crush we can no longer be friends?,"Here is some back story on my crush:

My crush is the most perfect person I've ever met.

Curly brown hair, big brown eyes, funny personality, and way more popular than I am. They were three to four years older than me, and at the time I asked I was fifteen.

We are fairly similar. We both like the same artist, have read the same books, have the same beliefs, and have the same sexuality.

Back when I first met them, I wanted a sign that they were the right person. I kept saying that if they were the ones to let me see them again, and I'm not fucking joking the same day I walk into a coffee shop that I had been going to for ages, and they were working there!

So now you know some backstory:

After this, seven months went by, and we got to be pretty close friends. We talked at least once a week and saw each other bi-weekly.

Welp, they come in one week and tell me they went on a date with someone. To put it short I was shaken up.

They were supposed to love me... Right? All the signs were there...

Somehow I let my friend convince me to confess to them over text one night.

This is exactly what I sent:

""Hey, there‚Äôs been something I‚Äôve wanted to get off my chest, and I wanted to go ahead and say it. I thought I was fine with how our friendship was and everything, but I realize now that I need to go ahead and have this conversation. I like you, and I thought I would be able to handle you being with someone else, but when you told me about that date you had, it really shook me. So I just needed to know, do you like me?? If this changes things between us, I'm sorry, I just needed to know.""

The reason I did this was because I wanted some sort of closure. If they liked me then great, if they didn't I would never have to speak to them again. I was expecting to be slandered and told I was ugly and that they hated me, but no.

Of course, they rejected me in the kindest way possible, reminding me why I fell in love in the first place.

This is what they sent:

""First I appreciate your honesty I know it takes a lot of guts to tell someone you like them and second I‚Äôm really sorry \[My name redacted\] but I‚Äôm going to be honest too and say I don‚Äôt think of you that way. It doesn‚Äôt have to change anything between us because I genuinely love being your friend and you have to understand you are significantly younger than me and I just think it wouldn‚Äôt be appropriate for anything to happen between us other than friendship. Again you‚Äôre incredibly brave for doing this and I know that you‚Äôre probably shaking so just take a deep breath okay?""

Now I don't know what to fucking do! They even added me on another one of their Instagram accounts an hour ago. They were so gentle and kind. Even reminding me to breathe, because they knew I would be shaking.

The thing is, I'm not even mad at them. Things would have been so much easier if they were mean to me. There are things I can change like how I look, how I act, how I dress, but I can't change my age. 

I feel so stuck, and I truly want them to be happy. But the selfish part of me wants me to tell them to wait on me. I know they won't and that they will date other people. That's what's so hard. I don't know if I can continue to be their friend and watch them date people in front of my face. I mean, even the mention of a small date had me shaken up. Even worse, I don't know if I could even face them again out of shame and out of embarrassment. They do seem like they value and want to continue our friendship, but I'm worried about the mental toll. So, WIBTA, if I just cut off our friendship here?",2,1742806658.0,AITAH,9,0.75,False

I‚Äôm curious, what do you do, if anything, to stay healthy whilst you‚Äôre on the road.

I always stay at a hotel with a gym (and not a Fitness Room!) and tend to workout most days when I‚Äôm away - so exercise isn‚Äôt really a problem. 

However, my diet is the thing that lets me down. I don‚Äôt do breakfast (aside from a black coffee). Lunch is usually one of the Huel savoury pots or something like a Subway or a meal deal. Dinner is usually some form of takeaway (Sushi, burger, etc.).

I‚Äôve tried meal prep a few times but I can‚Äôt reliably access a fridge (although it‚Äôs possible). 

Would love to hear any go-to meals (either for lunch or dinner) that are ‚Äòas healthy as can be‚Äô when travelling. If you do do meal prep - what are your go-tos. Is there such a thing as a healthy takeaway üôÉ

For reference, I‚Äôm UK based and usually do 3 days / 2 nights away per week.

Thanks in advance!

Chapter 1: Quicksave

It was May 8th, 2020 for the third time, and Ryan had already caused two traffic accidents.

He blamed the people of New Rome for this. The city‚Äôs inhabitants were as nervous as coffee addicts in the morning, and drove their cars like monkeys out for his blood. Moving on the walkway would have been safer.

Thankfully, he had saved right before passing the¬†*‚ÄòWelcome to New Rome‚Äô*¬†sign at the end of the highway linking the city to the rest of the Campania region.

Driving his highly customized red Plymouth Fury, Ryan stopped right before a tank truck would have hit him to the left, dodged a¬†*Bliss*\-addict meth-head, and then finally reached New Rome‚Äôs strip.

Owing to its reputation as the largest metropolis in Italy and a ravaged Europe‚Äôs capital of sin, New Rome was quite the sight. Built around the shores of the gulf of Naples years after Mechron‚Äôs drones bombed it to oblivion, it had the tallest buildings Ryan had seen since the end of the Genome Wars. None held a candle to the Dynamis Tower north of town, a glass spire symbolizing the company‚Äôs power over the region; corporate money had built New Rome, a city with no gods nor kings. Only money.

At the left of the driveway, Ryan could see the pristine Mediterranean Sea, glittering with the sunset while a distant island cast a long shadow on the horizon; on his right, he could glance at the countless casinos, gambling dens, and luxury hostels who drew so many tourists to the city. He even glimpsed the famous Colosseum Maximus, a modern replica of the old world‚Äôs Colosseum.

This district truly deserved its name of the Golden Coast.

Ryan himself attracted a few glances from tourists since he drove in his Quicksave costume. He covered his adorable face with a metal, mouthless mask with two rounded glasses for eyes, and his black hair beneath a black top hat. Add to that a navy blue trench coat, a purple shirt, blue pants, black gloves, and boots, and you became¬†*style incarnate*.

The outfit was hot to wear, and not very practical for fighting, but it looked amazing. To Quicksave, that was all that mattered.

As he continued moving north towards his destination, Ryan noticed a few eye-catching publicity boards. One of them portrayed the superheroine Wyvern, a beautiful amazon of a woman with shoulder-length black hair, sharp greyish eyes, and a white bodysuit, showing off her muscles with a green potion in the background.

*‚ÄòWant to be as strong as Wyvern? With our Hercules Elixir, what Hercules did in twelve labors, you will do in an afternoon!‚Äô*

*‚ÄòOne hundred thousand euros, only at Dynamis!‚Äô*

Meh, everyone wanted to be a Genome these days, even the shadow of one. Then again, who could resist superpowers-in-a-can? Ryan hadn‚Äôt, although he had taken the¬†*real*¬†stuff, not a cheap knockoff giving just a fraction of a real superpower.

His life had been a rollercoaster ever since.

Driving in front of a cliff tourist spot and a Miami-like beach, Ryan reached a tourist district, full of bars, nightclubs, and restaurants. The place smelled of drugs and alcohol, but it didn‚Äôt look seedy either. The worst neighborhoods were in the north, from what he had heard.

Having memorized the city‚Äôs map, Ryan quickly found the place he was looking for; an unremarkable pub located between an Italian restaurant and a closed nightclub. Parking his car nearby, the courier stepped down and opened his trunk.

Never good at organizing stuff, the young man had left all his belongings in a chaotic mess. His tools, computers, and weapons formed a mass of metal almost overflowing from the car; although none compared to his white rabbit plushie, the most devastating tool in his arsenal.

After searching, Ryan quickly found the black briefcase he had been hired to deliver, seized it, closed the trunk, and then entered the pub.

It was something of a cozy place with ten tables, only a third of them occupied. He briefly noticed some Latin muchacho trying to impress his date by levitating a coin in the air‚Äîhe must have wasted fifty thousand bucks on a knockoff elixir. A balding, wrinkled old man with tanned skin stood behind the counter, looking at the newcomer suspiciously.

‚ÄúHello, local humans, I come in peace!‚Äù Ryan addressed the carbon-based lifeform called a barman. ‚ÄúIs this Renesco‚Äôs¬†*Jolie Wrangler*?‚Äù

The man behind the counter glared at him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs written on the front door. What do you want?‚Äù

Why did the bar‚Äôs title involve both French and English words, while the barman sounded like a true Italian? Multiculturalism struck again! ‚ÄúThen you must be Renesco!‚Äù Ryan handed the poor fellow the briefcase. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been hired to give you this! It‚Äôs full of mushrooms and a bomb, but I didn‚Äôt open it this time.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis time?‚Äù the barman frowned. ‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Quicksave,‚Äù Ryan introduced himself, tipping his hat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm immortal, but don‚Äôt tell anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúMan, you said it loud enough for everyone to hear!‚Äù someone jeered at the back, the few clients laughing.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your power?‚Äù the barman asked, unimpressed. ‚ÄúImmortality?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs part of a package deal,‚Äù Ryan replied.

‚ÄúWhatever,‚Äù Renesco grumbled while he seized the briefcase. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell my boss and you should receive your payment soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood to hear!‚Äù Ryan replied, a hand on the counter. ‚ÄúHey, look, since I‚Äôm here, have you seen a girl called Len? Black hair, blue eyes, Marxist-Leninist?‚Äù

‚ÄúNever heard of her,‚Äù the barman said with a shrug. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking for a girl, try a brothel.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not really the type, but thanks anyway.‚Äù Knowing her, Len was probably hiding in some underground Kremlin bunker. ‚ÄúAny place where you can buy custom genius tech? Homemade?‚Äù

‚ÄúTry Rust Town in the north, if you‚Äôre brave enough. You can always find interesting stuff at the Junkyard, but it‚Äôs full of cutthroats and Psychos nowadays.‚Äù The barman looked at Quicksave head to toe. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to eat you alive.‚Äù

Ryan shrugged, while he heard someone enter the bar. The temperature seemed to suddenly drop a few degrees. ‚ÄúRenesco?‚Äù the newcomer asked.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù the barman replied, frowning.

A second later, an ice spear tore out Renesco‚Äôs throat and nailed him to the back wall.

Ryan tried to activate his time-stop, but a sharp icicle hit his chest at astonishing speed. It pierced his bulletproof jacket and his ribs like a spear, then came out on the other side; leaving a gaping hole where the lungs should have been.

The room erupted in screams, as projectiles shredded the tables and clients alike. Struggling against the sharp pain in his chest, Ryan collapsed on the counter but managed to glance at his attacker.

The newcomer removed his hoodie, revealing his face‚Ä¶ or rather his lack of one. He looked like a walking, skinless skeleton with vestigial muscles, skeletal fingers, and frozen eyes. An unnatural, chilling mist came out of his mouth and nasal cavities, transforming into ice weapons.

A Genome. Considering his physical mutation, maybe even a Psycho.

‚ÄúAdam sends his regards,‚Äù the killer rasped. The muchacho man in the bar‚Äôs back tried to telekinetically throw a chair at him, but the hostile Genome grew an armor of ice over his bones. A few icicles later, the Spanish guy and his date had their face redrawn in a cubic style.

‚ÄúI will get you‚Ä¶‚Äù Ryan dramatically raised a finger at his murderer, blood flowing from his mouth, ‚Äúon my next save...‚Äù

The undead froze him alive with a wave of his hand, and all went dark.

It was May 8th 2020 for the fourth time, and Ryan was¬†*pissed*.

Three times! Three times he had died trying to make this damn delivery!

Then again, that was what he got when not paying attention. With the exception of his save point, his powers needed a conscious action to activate; his enhanced timing sense, in particular, didn‚Äôt kick in until after he had lived through events once already.

Ryan didn‚Äôt mind dying, since he had gotten used to it after the first two dozen times‚Ä¶ but dying so soon? Less than two hours after establishing a save point, three times in a row? His loops usually lasted days, allowing him to try new and interesting stunts; while repeating the same things in quick succession bored him to death.

This meant war.

Ryan entered his autopilot mode, his mind wandering off while his body repeated all the actions of his previous save. He only stopped and regained full consciousness as he reached the bar.

Instead of entering, Ryan remained in his car, waiting for his killer to show up.

He didn‚Äôt have to wait long, as the assassin walked out of a street corner, hands in his pockets and his ugly face hidden beneath a hoodie. It said something about New Rome that this crook didn‚Äôt draw attention, as he entered the¬†*Jolie Wrangler*.

There was only one rational, responsible way to act.

Ryan moved the car right in front of the pub, set an ACDC song on the radio, and then smashed the accelerator.

Pedestrians screamed in panic, some leaping out of the way as the car drove into the Wrangler‚Äôs entrance. Having been reinforced specifically for this kind of stunt, the Plymouth demolished the wall and hit the assassin from behind before he could attack. The collision propelled the hostile Genome against the counter, like a deer on the road.

Quicksave briefly looked around, in case he had accidentally hit any of the clients; he had been very careful to position himself in an angle with nobody but the assassin on the path, but you could never know. Thankfully, he hadn‚Äôt harmed anyone, and the Spanish muchacho was too busy holding his terrified girlfriend in his arms to throw stuff at Ryan.

Good. He wouldn‚Äôt have to reload again.

‚ÄúHey, guys, I‚Äôm Quicksave!‚Äù Ryan told the shocked clients, as he stepped down and moved behind his car. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm immortal, but don‚Äôt tell anyone!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling Security!‚Äù Renesco shouted while hiding behind the counter.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother, I will be done in a minute!‚Äù Ryan replied before opening his car‚Äôs trunk, unconcerned. He looked at his weapons, trying to find the right one for the job.

The pisto-gauntlets? Too intimate.

The gauss rifle? Too quick.

The shotgun? Tempting, but overdone.

The rabbit plushie? Far too powerful.

The baseball bat?

Bat it was.

Ryan whistled while playing with his chosen weapon, approaching the assassin as he rose back to his feet, using the counter as support. Any other person would have died, but all Genomes possessed enhanced physical abilities.

‚ÄúWho the fuck are you?‚Äù the undead assassin hissed angrily, trying to manifest his armor of ice over his body as he did in the last loop, but too stunned to focus. ‚ÄúAn Augusti?!‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm just a courier,‚Äù Ryan said, trying to think of a good one-liner. ‚ÄúSorry, can you give me your name while you still have teeth?‚Äù

The skeleton responded by raising his hand, unleashing a volley of ice shards.

In response, Ryan lazily stopped time. The world turned silent, everything gained a purple hue, and the icicles froze in midair.

Eh.¬†*Froze*. The courier memorized that pun for later.

‚ÄúYeah, you took me by surprise last time,‚Äù Quicksave said, as he moved around the path of the attack until he was right in front of his target. Neither clients nor the enemy Genome could move, trapped between two seconds. ‚ÄúNot gonna happen again.‚Äù

When time resumed and the world regained its colors, the skeleton kissed the aluminum bat intimately. The undead Genome lost a few teeth since his jaw was tight. Must have been his first time.

The attack tossed the killer to his knees, and another strike introduced him face-first to the ground. Ryan started beating him up to the tune of¬†*Highway to Hell,*¬†singing to himself. Between the shock of being hit by a car at full speed and the blow to the head, the enemy Genome couldn‚Äôt mount a resistance. Also, it seemed he had some frozen blood below the bones and vestigial flesh.

‚ÄúI feel like the healthcare system, beating up a helpless granny.‚Äù Ryan shook his head in disgust at the assassin, before hitting him again. ‚ÄúLook at what you made me do!‚Äù

The wicked fossil couldn‚Äôt offer a good excuse, so Quicksave continued his assault. His unnatural resilience would allow him to survive far worse, and considering he had killed Ryan once, the courier didn‚Äôt feel bad beating him up within an inch of his life.

‚ÄúDrop your weapons!‚Äù

Ryan turned around, three men in black riot gear pointing energy rifles at him from behind. They surrounded his car, while they proudly displayed the ouroboros symbol of the Dynamis corporation on their chests; probably members of Private Security. A crowd of civilians had gathered outside the bar, looking at the scene while maintaining a respectful distance. Some had even started taking pictures.

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm just trying to help!‚Äù Ryan protested, waving his bloodstained bat in surrender after kicking the assassin with his boot one last time.

‚ÄúYou blew up my bar!‚Äù Renesco protested, emerging from behind the counter with a crimson face.

‚ÄúOh, you want money?‚Äù Quicksave quickly searched inside his trench coat as three red circles appeared on his mask, before bringing out a wad of banknotes worth fifty thousand euros. ‚ÄúHere, have a treat!‚Äù

Renesco looked at the money, grabbed it, counted, and then made a conflicted face. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs more than enough to pay for the repairs,‚Äù he told the guards. ‚ÄúThe guy on the floor tried to attack us, the other weirdo came to help.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have a license?‚Äù one of the security guards asked Ryan, who shook his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a vigilante? An Augusti? Company Genome?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope!‚Äù Ryan replied.

‚ÄúWell, if you don‚Äôt have a license, why shouldn‚Äôt we take you into custody alongside that bone guy?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat, you want money too?‚Äù

And Ryan threw a bribe at him.

The security captain grabbed the wad with one hand, counted while keeping his weapon aimed at Quicksave‚Äôs head, then chuckled. ‚ÄúYou think you can buy our honor with that?‚Äù

Ryan threw him a bigger bribe.

‚ÄúBetter,‚Äù the Security guardsman said, putting the money in a pocket full of grenades. He lowered his rifle and had his two compatriots gently grab the assassin, after punching him in the gut. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad we helped make the neighborhood safer today.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù Ryan replied. ‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù

‚ÄúRenesco?‚Äù The captain asked the barman, as his men carried the assassin away. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget to pay your monthly subscription. We won‚Äôt always be there to protect your establishment.‚Äù

And on these wise words, the trio left without looking back.

‚ÄúDo you always carry wads of money on yourself?‚Äù Renesco asked Quicksave, astonished by the surreal scene.

‚ÄúWhen you cause as much collateral damage as I do, it‚Äôs a real time saver,‚Äù Ryan replied, the baseball bat still dripping with blood. ‚ÄúWho was that skeletal fellow anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúGhoul, a Psycho from the Meta-Gang. Elixir junkies who have been hitting places like mine recently.‚Äù Renesco glared at Ryan, then at his car, and then back at its driver. ‚ÄúNow, get the fuck out of my bar.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, not until after I finish the damn delivery.‚Äù Ryan handed the briefcase to Renesco, not really caring about the attention he brought on it. Quicksave¬†*always*¬†delivered; no matter how many deaths needed!

The barman‚Äôs eyes flashed with recognition, and then confusion. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it,‚Äù Renesco said, as he grabbed the briefcase. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt paid half of what you spent in the last minute.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about the money,‚Äù Ryan replied. He looked around as if worried that anyone listened, then whispered into Renesco‚Äôs ear.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just bored.‚Äù

The man looked at Ryan in silence, while the courier whistled to himself as he returned to his car, driving under the sunset towards new adventures.

Sidequest, complete!

1jim3in,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jim3in/i_got_rejected_by_my_crush_how_do_i_move_on/,I got rejected by my crush. How do I move on?,"Here is some back story on my crush:

My crush is the most perfect person I've ever met.

Curly brown hair, big brown eyes, funny personality, and way more popular than I am. They were three to four years older than me, and at the time I asked I was fifteen.

We are fairly similar. We both like the same artist, have read the same books, have the same beliefs, and have the same sexuality.

Back when I first met them, I wanted a sign that they were the right person. I kept saying that if they were the ones to let me see them again, and I'm not fucking joking the same day I walk into a coffee shop that I had been going to for ages, and they were working there!

So now you know some backstory:

After this, seven months went by, and we got to be pretty close friends. We talked at least once a week and saw each other bi-weekly.

Welp, they come in one week and tell me they went on a date with someone. To put it short I was shaken up.

They were supposed to love me... Right? All the signs were there...

Somehow I let my friend convince me to confess to them over text one night.

This is exactly what I sent:

""Hey, there‚Äôs been something I‚Äôve wanted to get off my chest, and I wanted to go ahead and say it. I thought I was fine with how our friendship was and everything, but I realize now that I need to go ahead and have this conversation. I like you, and I thought I would be able to handle you being with someone else, but when you told me about that date you had, it really shook me. So I just needed to know, do you like me?? If this changes things between us, I'm sorry, I just needed to know.""

The reason I did this was because I wanted some sort of closure. If they liked me then great, if they didn't I would never have to speak to them again. I was expecting to be slandered and told I was ugly and that they hated me, but no.

Of course, the person I fell in love with would never do that.

This is what they sent:

""First I appreciate your honesty I know it takes a lot of guts to tell someone you like them and second I‚Äôm really sorry \[My name redacted\] but I‚Äôm going to be honest too and say I don‚Äôt think of you that way. It doesn‚Äôt have to change anything between us because I genuinely love being your friend and you have to understand you are significantly younger than me and I just think it wouldn‚Äôt be appropriate for anything to happen between us other than friendship. Again you‚Äôre incredibly brave for doing this and I know that you‚Äôre probably shaking so just take a deep breath okay?""

Now I don't know what to fucking do! They even added me on another one of their Instagram accounts an hour ago. They were so gentle and kind. Even reminding me to breathe, because they knew I would be shaking.

I've cried about this, I've laughed at my stupidity, and I've gone through every encounter between us that might happen after this.

The real question is how do I get over someone?

How do I get over someone I've loved for seven months? How do I get over the person who made me realize I was queer? How do I get over someone who I feel so connected to? How do I get over someone who still is my friend? And how do I act like everything is fine as I watch them grow up, date other people, and leave me behind?

Because despite what they think of me, I‚Äôm not brave... And they have me thinking of waiting as many years as they need me to, for them to be comfortable.

I'm scared that in every other relationship, I will look for fragments and pieces of them. That'll be stuck here, waiting for them to be ready, for the rest of my life.",1,1742805728.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

During the treatment, a professional dentist applies a professional-strength whitening gel to your teeth, which is then activated by a special light. This process breaks down stubborn stains and discoloration, revealing a dramatically whiter smile in less than an hour.

Rant!,"‚ÄúThe Cult of the Next Big Thing (Starring: Science of Reading)‚Äù Another day, another PD slideshow telling me THIS‚Äîthis right here‚Äîis the missing piece to all my teaching woes. Enter: The Science of Reading (cue Gregorian chanting, teachers everywhere clutching their scarred copies of ‚ÄúThe Reading Strategies Book‚Äù like contraband).

But before I sacrifice all my leveled readers and pledge allegiance to orthographic mapping, let‚Äôs take a respectful stroll down the Boulevard of Broken

Buzzwords: ‚Ä¢ Whole Language (guess, sweetie)

‚Ä¢ Phonics-Only (decode or perish)

‚Ä¢ Balanced Literacy (why not both?)

‚Ä¢ Reading Recovery (until your funding disappears)

‚Ä¢ Guided Reading (leveled to death)

‚Ä¢ Brain Gym (because touching your toes makes you literate)

‚Ä¢ Learning Styles (Visual, Auditory, or Hogwarts House?)

‚Ä¢ Multiple Intelligences (I‚Äôll take Existential Smarts for $500, Alex)

‚Ä¢ Close Reading (now with 300% more highlighters!)

‚Ä¢ Growth Mindset (believe your way to fluency, kids)

‚Ä¢ Grit (because what 6-year-old doesn‚Äôt need more resilience training?)

‚Ä¢ The Flipped Classroom (because homework wasn‚Äôt confusing enough)

‚Ä¢ Common Core (raise your hand if you‚Äôre still traumatized)

‚Ä¢ Personalized Learning (or, as we call it, another laptop program)

‚Ä¢ Trauma-Informed Everything (necessary, but suddenly it‚Äôs in PE, too?)

‚Ä¢ Restorative Circles (let‚Äôs kumbaya our way through plagiarism)

‚Ä¢ Universal Design for Learning (still waiting for someone to explain this clearly)

And now we are here, baptizing ourselves in the river of Science of Reading as if Lucy Calkins herself hasn‚Äôt already been thrown under the bus. Here‚Äôs the thing: I love research. I love best practices. But I also know this isn‚Äôt the first time the pendulum has swung. And it won‚Äôt be the last.

I‚Äôll teach the phonemes. I‚Äôll map the graphemes. But I‚Äôll also keep doing what has worked since Socrates sat under a tree: build trust, love students, treat them with respect, read good books, meet kids where they are, and TEACH LIKE A HUMAN.

Because trends fade, programs expire, and the buzzwords on your PD slideshow will be someone‚Äôs punchline in five years. But me ?

My Baratza Sette 30 stopped grinding this weekend. It does make a (terrible) noise but no coffee comes out of the grinder. I heard about the gearbox being made in plastic and eventually wearing out. Based on the video, is this what the issue is about?

I am based in Belgium, do you know if the Baratza customer service will be willing to repair my unit? Their customer chat service seems offline so I did not manage yet to contact them.

Thanks !

I just went to Second Cup for the first time in my life this week. It was *amazing*. It felt like such a luxury compared to Tim‚Äôs and Starbucks. 

The coffee didn‚Äôt taste like it came from a dirty machine. It didn‚Äôt taste burnt, or like motor oil. It just tasted like coffee. Really good coffee. That‚Äôs insanely rare nowadays. 

The service was fantastic. The prices are almost as good as Tim‚Äôs. They use biodegradable plastic straws instead of paper ones.

The best part? It‚Äôs actually Canadian! Unlike Tim‚Äôs, it isn‚Äôt owned by an American company.

I feel ashamed for never having gone there before. I genuinely never want to go back to Tim‚Äôs or Starbucks again. Second Cup is better in every single way. 

If you guys haven‚Äôt been there, I strongly recommend it :)
