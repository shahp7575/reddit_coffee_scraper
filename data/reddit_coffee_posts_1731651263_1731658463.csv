1 of the 2 I‚Äôm seeing regularly has long term potential and we‚Äôve been seeing each other ~2x a week for 3 weeks‚Äîand sleeping together. 

We‚Äôve both said that we‚Äôre seeing other people. 

We‚Äôre both on the same page about wanting to get to know people, and ideally eventually it will be clear who we‚Äôre intentionally choosing to spend time with‚Ä¶

But what about the other person talking about their other dates while out with you? Am I weird for saying it gives me the ick to be SO in your face about it? 

Last night I‚Äôm out at dinner with long term potential guy, and we‚Äôre talking about what‚Äôs on deck for tomorrow, and he says, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm grading some papers, doing some lesson planning, and I‚Äôm meeting someone for coffee for a first date.‚Äô

Really? Wtf. IMO some things don‚Äôt need to be said if we‚Äôre both on the same page. Or am I overreacting? ",2,1731657462.0,datingoverforty,2,1.0,False

Before I went to sleep last night, I had nurses come 2 times, around 9:30pm and then at 10:40pm asking if I want to take some anxiety medication to help me sleep better. I refused both times as it wasn't initially prescribed, and in general I don't have a problem to sleep. 
My alarm woke me up at 7:15 am, I stayed in bad a bit. At 7:35am a nurse came by to take blood samples for the analysis. A few minutes later another one came to run a blood test for sugar. 
Around 8:10 am there was a breakfast, this time I had to choose between coffee, hot chocolate, water and tea (I went for hot chocolate). For food there was bread with butter and jamm.
Around 8:35 am the nurses came to take my blood pressure, my weight and gave me my meds at a slightly higher dose (duloxetine 90mg instead of 60, they also gave me acetylcysteine as apparently it helps evacuate drugs (curious of the mechanism though, does it help to eliminate them through secretions?).

1grrf80,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1grrf80/my_housemate_keeps_using_my_stuff_and_i_feel/,My housemate keeps using my stuff and I feel suffocated.,"TLDR - my housemate won‚Äôt stop stealing/ using my stuff but denies everything.

I recently moved in with an old friend on a whim because I had no other options and on paper it seemed perfect - however it‚Äôs kind of been a nightmare. 
There have been a lot of little issues that have been bothering me but the thing that‚Äôs eating away at me the most, is that she cannot leave my stuff alone.  

- The first thing I noticed, was that some of my medication was missing. I confronted her about it but she denied anything to do with it. After this conversation, I started locking my medication in my safe, and I don‚Äôt know why, but this seemed to have really made things worse.

- After that, she asked to borrow a pair of my shoes for an event (I said yes but just once - my mistake). She must‚Äôve liked the shoes because she then started letting herself into my room daily to take them while I was at work. She wore them to the point that they were too stretched for me to wear and when I asked for her to buy me a new pair, she said ‚Äúyou can have your shoes back and I‚Äôll get a new pair for myself‚Äù. After a pointless back and forth I gave up. 

- Next came using my shower products. Things that used to last me a year, are now lasting me less then a month, and when I brought it up, she denied using them. This one really frustrates me because I work hard so I can treat myself with these things, and now I feel like it‚Äôs a complete waste.

- Then she started eating my food and drinking my coffee. 

- Last night I had an event to go too and went to put on my favourite pair of shoes and wouldn‚Äôt you know - they were falling off my feet. These shoes were hidden in my closet, under a pile of clothes on a hard to reach shelf which means she‚Äôs been actively sifting through my stuff while I‚Äôm at work. The soles of the shoes had been cleaned - I‚Äôm assuming so I ‚Äòwouldn‚Äôt notice‚Äô they‚Äôd been worn? (Only reason I‚Äôm assuming this is because I‚Äôve worn these shoes a lot and they should not be spotless).

- Today I came home from work and found that a good amount of my shower products are now near empty and all of my coffee is gone. 

I do want to change the lock on my bedroom door however this won‚Äôt stop her using my shower products or eating my food. 

I know moving out is obvious- but long story short - that‚Äôs not an option for me right now.

They not only reduce environmental impact but also add a touch of sophistication to your living spaces. From cozy throws to elegant curtains, these textiles can transform your home into a haven of comfort and beauty. Let‚Äôs explore some sustainable options and how to incorporate them into your living room, enhancing the space with pieces like [living room furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture), a side[ table for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/side-tables), and a [coffee table for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables).

**Why Choose Eco-Friendly Textiles?**  

Eco-friendly textiles are made using sustainable materials and processes that minimize harm to the environment. They are often crafted from organic, recycled, or biodegradable materials, making them a responsible choice for your home. Benefits include:  

Durability: Many eco-friendly fabrics are designed to last, reducing the need for frequent replacements.  

Non-Toxic: These textiles are free from harmful chemicals, ensuring a healthier living environment.  

Unique Aesthetic: Sustainable fabrics often have unique textures and patterns that add character to your home.

**Sustainable Textile Options for a Stylish Living Room**  

Your living room is the heart of your home, and incorporating eco-friendly textiles here can make a big impact. Here‚Äôs how:  

**1. Organic Cotton Throws and Cushions**

Drape an organic cotton throw over your favorite armchair or sofa. Pair it with cushions made from natural dyes to add warmth and coziness. The soft texture complements the clean lines of \*\*living room furniture\*\* like a modern sofa or an accent chair.  

**2. Hemp and Linen Curtains**

Replace synthetic curtains with hemp or linen options. These materials are biodegradable, durable, and lend a breezy, minimalist vibe to your living room. They pair beautifully with a chic side table for the living room, especially when accessorized with a vase of fresh greenery.  

**3. Jute or Sisal Rugs**

Add depth and texture to your living room with a jute or sisal rug. These natural fibers are both stylish and sustainable, creating the perfect foundation for a coffee table for the living room, like a rustic wooden or sleek metal design.  

**Pairing Textiles with Furniture**  

Eco-friendly textiles shine when paired thoughtfully with furniture. Here‚Äôs how to achieve a cohesive look:  

**Living Room Furniture:** Use textiles in neutral tones to complement bold or colorful furniture pieces. A soft woolen throw can make a statement sofa even more inviting.  

**Side Table for Living Room:** Style your side table with a handcrafted linen runner or a small macram√© plant hanger. These elements add texture and tie the space together.  

**Coffee Table for Living Room:** Dress up your coffee table with a woven basket or organic cotton coasters. These accents provide both function and sustainable flair.

**Where to Find Eco-Friendly Textiles**  

Many brands now offer sustainable home decor solutions. Look for certifications like GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) or OEKO-TEX to ensure authenticity. Better yet, support local artisans who use traditional, eco-conscious techniques to create beautiful and unique pieces.

**Final Thoughts**  

By incorporating eco-friendly textiles into your living room, you‚Äôre not just making a style statement; you‚Äôre contributing to a healthier planet. Whether it‚Äôs through organic cotton cushions, jute rugs, or linen curtains, these sustainable options harmonize perfectly with living room furniture, a side table for the living room, or a coffee table for the living room. Create a space that reflects your values and exudes timeless elegance.

We go to college together, and we are both in a class that meets every day for an hour. We‚Äôre always in a huge group, so we never really get to talk 1:1. We‚Äôve had a few conversations, but it hasn‚Äôt been anything beyond surface level chit chat.

Well, about 2 weeks ago, I saw her at a party I was at. I went to up to her and started talking, joking, and all that good stuff. She seemed to be very talkative and she laughed a lot too. Since then, we‚Äôve talked a little more, but still not as much as I‚Äôd like.

I‚Äôm thinking about asking her out on a coffee date for next Friday (better ideas are welcome), but I have just a few issues that are preventing me from just shooting my shot. 

1) Like I said, we haven‚Äôt talked much beyond very surface level stuff. Because of this, I‚Äôm not sure that she even likes me like that.

2) We‚Äôve never talked outside of this class - excluding the party. I don‚Äôt have her number, her social media, or anything. I technically have her GroupMe, but I‚Äôm not going to text on there.

3) I have to see her every single day for an hour a day, and we have mutual friends. I‚Äôm worried that if I ask her out and she says no, that it‚Äôs gonna be really awkward from now on. 

4) Because we only see each other in a group setting, I don‚Äôt know how I can ask her privately about whether she‚Äôd want to go out.

I‚Äôve been crushing on this girl, for months. We were school friends and we were going along well. Recently, I‚Äôd been working up the courage to ask her out. I wanted something fun and casual, so I decided on bowling.

It all started when she posted an Instagram story of a very popular spot in my town. My brain jumped to conclusions: ‚ÄúShe's in town!‚Äù I pictured us laughing at how bad we‚Äôd be at bowling, grabbing cold-coffee after. Without checking further, I sent her a text:

‚ÄúHey, I saw your story! Are you free this weekend? Can we go bowling together?.‚Äù

I felt a mix of excitement and nerves after sending it. Moments later, my phone buzzed:

‚ÄúHey! That sounds fun, but I‚Äôm actually not in [town]. I was just passing through a couple of days ago and posted that pic then. I‚Äôm back home now. Sorry for the confusion! üòÖ‚Äù

My heart sank. She wasn‚Äôt even close to my town and hadn‚Äôt been for days. The realization that I‚Äôd completely misread the situation hit hard. I imagined her laughing at my over-eager assumption.

She was kind and understanding, which somehow made it worse. I replied, ‚ÄúNo worries! Let me know next time you‚Äôre in town!‚Äù But the damage to my pride was done already.

I kept replaying how I could‚Äôve avoided this by simply checking the timestamp or asking where she was. The embarrassment kept me from texting her for a while, but thankfully, she didn‚Äôt make it awkward or tell anyone.

Lesson learned: always double-check before making assumptions.

TL;DR: Thought my crush was in town from her Instagram story, asked her out, and found out she‚Äôd already left. Embarrassed myself completely.",0,1731654205.0,tifu,7,0.28,False

I don't drink alcohol, chocolates, sweets, no coffee. High triglycerides are due to the high consumption of clarified butter.

This has been an eye opener and so glad I did this test.

I was 24 and he was 40. Now I am 29 and haven't seen him in  years. I wasn't coworker with her back then. They were and are a wealthy family who lived in a nice neighbourhood meant for those with money. I worked there at a bakery/ coffee shop and he was a regular customer. I felt a strong attraction to him since day one but he never acted interested for weeks. Didn't give off cheater vibes, he had his wedding bend on and often came with his teen daughter.

But we ended hooking up after almost 2 months. our affair lasted for a few months. But I realised what a trash human being I am and one day I just found another job in another part of the city. He had my number and texted me to see where I am but when I said that I found another job he was like, oh fine, good luck.

Now, my life and situation is much better. I work in a big company and my pay is more than decent. And his daughter joined our department (At least not my team!) as a student. First I just suspected it is her, but then I saw her name and it was clear. She is really nice and modest (not like him) and she also remembered me from the bakery (she was 14 back then). On weekly basis I have to work with her.

And two days ago it finally happened what I feared so much. The rain was pouring and he came to pick her up from the office. I thought she is waiting for an Uber, so i waited with her. And then I saw his Mercedes and I thought I will throw up. She asked if I am sure I don't want to go with them (fortunately I also ordered an uber,s o I had a good excuse to say no). He saw me and I believe he recognised me because after getting into the car she told me through the window that her dad is also asking if I want to join. Yesterday at the office she confirmed that her father also recognised me. She thought it is cool and fun.

We continue to snap until soon 2 days ago. Yesterday we didn't snap at all but I didn't think of it too much. I checked snapchat last night  and noticed that I couldnt find her account anymore. It was gone from my friends list.

I messaged her on instagram and just asked how things are and if she is still up to meet tomorrow. Will wait for an answer tomorrow.

Do you guys think she did not feel for it anymore and decided to ghost me?

This is my first time asking a girl out so this has not really happened to me before.

Maybe snapchat is just being weird?

And if she doesn't message me back on insta before our date should I still go and see if shes there?

The trip there and back will only cost me 26 euro/dollar. I would think that would be worth it to see if shes there or not but idk.

And if shes not interested anymore, why would she not just say that to me? Would be much nicer and I would obviously respect it.

So I quit. It was hard as I was drinking 1-2 energy drinks a day and drinking cola drinks and tea. It hit me **hard** and it was only when I persevered for a solid 3 months that I could look at a purple can of Rockstar without wanting to have it. It was around then that my anxiety, whilst still present, was significantly reduced. I miss this.

After a number of life changes that ended with my sleeping pattern being disturbed, I started supplementing sleep with caffeine, it started with tea, then coffee, then frappucinos and eventually I was drinking monster. 

I feel a level of dread a lot of the time, *especially* in the morning. I'm always tired, even though my life has got to a point where I can manage my sleep 100x better. Before caffeine was reintroduced to my life, these were all rarities, rather than commonalities.

I'm quitting again now, but it was much easier when I was younger.

Tl;dr:  you can get through the initial cravings, you can feel much better. But don't start again when you have your energy depleted constantly or your sleep schedule gets messed with.

I'm confused by the behaviour of my female coworker - I've worked with her a year and had feelings grow for her over the last 8 months or so, but kept it secret to avoid work awkwardness.

1. She initiates texting every few days.
2. Remembers small things about me and my preferences, interests.
3. Accepted an invitation to go for a coffee with me after work, then latterly went for a walk and another coffee with me at the weekend.
4. Has talked about how she sees and wishes her private life will unfold (wanting to get married, have children - even explaining how she wants to experience pregnancy).
5. Tried to involve me in helping her with wordle which she loves, even though I've never played it and was teasing me when I kept doing it wrong.

Being a restrained kind of guy I'm uncertain if these are friendly, or flirting. She leaves for a new job in a month and I want to say something to her about how much I like her.",3,1731652981.0,dating,4,1.0,False

Molded chocolate refers to chocolate that has been melted and poured into molds to create specific shapes or designs. It is widely used in confectionery for crafting chocolates in various forms, from simple bars to intricate designs like figurines, holiday-themed shapes, or branded items.

**Types of Molded Chocolate**

1. **Solid Chocolate**: Pure chocolate molded into shapes without any filling.
2. **Hollow Chocolate**: Chocolate shells created by coating the mould‚Äôs interior and removing excess chocolate, resulting in a hollow shape (e.g., Easter eggs).
3. **Filled Chocolate**: Chocolate moulds filled with ganache, caramel, nuts, or other centres before sealing.

**Key Steps in Making Moulded Chocolate**

1. **Tempering the Chocolate**: Ensures a glossy finish, smooth texture, and proper snap.
2. **Pouring**: Melted chocolate is poured into moulds.
3. **Vibrating**: Removes air bubbles to ensure a smooth finish.
4. **Cooling and Setting**: The chocolate is cooled until it hardens, making it easy to demold.
5. **Demoulding**: Chocolates are carefully removed from the moulds.

**Advantages**

* **Customization**: Ideal for branding, festive designs, or unique shapes.
* **Versatility**: Can incorporate various fillings, decorations, or textures.
* **Durability**: Retains shape and quality when properly tempered.

**Applications**

* Chocolatiers and bakeries use moulded chocolate for decorative elements.
* Brands create promotional or seasonal products.
* Home bakers craft personalized gifts or treats.

**Chocolate Types for Moulding**

1. **Dark Chocolate**: Used for its rich flavor and firm texture.
2. **Milk Chocolate**: Offers a sweeter, creamier taste and softer texture.
3. **White Chocolate**: Ideal for light, sweet flavours; often paired with colorants for decorative designs.
4. **Compound Chocolate**: A budget-friendly alternative, often used for large-scale production as it doesn‚Äôt require tempering.

**Popular Flavors for Molded Chocolates**

1. **Classic Flavors**:

* **Vanilla**: Smooth and creamy with a subtle sweetness.
* **Caramel**: Buttery and rich, often paired with milk or dark chocolate.
* **Hazelnut**: Adds nuttiness, popular in praline fillings.

1. **Fruity Flavours**:

* **Citrus**: Orange, lemon, or lime zest blended into the chocolate.
* **Berries**: Raspberry, strawberry, or blueberry pur√©es or powders.
* **Tropical Fruits**: Mango, passionfruit, or pineapple for exotic tastes.
* **Cinnamon**: Adds warmth, often used in holiday-themed chocolates.
* **Cardamom**: Exotic and aromatic, pairs well with dark chocolate.

1. **Unique and Modern Flavours**:

* **Matcha**: Green tea powder for earthy, umami notes.
* **Salted Caramel**: A blend of sweet and savoury.
* **Coffee or Espresso**: Rich, bold flavour, perfect with dark chocolate.

It took me two years to gain the confidence to go to my grandma and my aunt and ask them to take us out. I was 14 when I finally got away the first time. She later went into rehab to fix herself and honestly I was happy when she was in there. Two years where I didn‚Äôt have to see her. I did go to the family meets for my younger sister though. She didn‚Äôt see the side I had. My sister was lucky but also unlucky. She‚Äôs didn‚Äôt get the abuse but she saw it and in her child mind them thought that is what love was. I‚Äôm glad she got away from our bio mom this year 
I remember this one time when I went to school crying like crazy with a handprint across my face. The crazy part about that was it was cause I didn‚Äôt make her coffee early enough. I was in 7th grade and I didn‚Äôt get questioned or pulled to the side about it until almost lunch time. I told them what happened and why it all happened. I remember being in that room with a cop two counselors a CPS lady and the principal. I felt like I was the one in trouble.

23M Korean-American.

**The Accident**

When I was 22, I tried moving a mattress into my NYC apartment. I lifted with bad form and started having pain in my left glute whenever I sat down. Like most health issues in my life, I thought of it as a temporary 2 week back muscle issue, I didn't know what a herniated disc was. I continued sitting down in my local wework working for my startup, flexing my spine to code on my laptop, and the symptoms progressively got worse.¬†

I had trouble sitting, I couldn't sleep and would wake up every 2 hours in pain to lie on my stomach, and the bad sleep would affect my work performance. I would bend forward thinking I'd need to stretch my hamstrings but that made the pain terrible. A sharp pain in my left glute medius, and a dull pain whenever I sat.

**Discovery**¬†

* I thought getting a firmer mattress would help, didn't help.
* I thought working from home with an ergonomic chair would help, didn't help.
* I went to a chiropractor, didn't help.¬†
   * Did an x-ray, claimed it was hip misalignment (?)
   * They attempted to trap me in a $5k 20 session plan
   * Apparently chiropractic care is a pseudoscience
      * There a good reason why its easier to meet chiropractors than Doctors

Went to PT, they said it was piriformis, and prescribed me clamshells and glute bridges. Each $300 session they would just tell me to perform these, and it felt like a waste of money so I stopped attending and did the exercises at home. Pain didn't stop, but I still continue to do these for hip strength.

By this point I found this sub, realized I likely had a herniated disc. To confirm which disc, I spent 1k on a lumbar MRI, to which they found a small bulge on l4-l5, and a large herniation on l5-s1. I probably should have done this earlier, but this was the first time I've spent my personal money on American healthcare and was very careful of my spending since I just started my career.

This is where I learned so much more about our spinal anatomy. When I explained my condition to people I was shocked how few knew what a disc was. Remember how your parents told you to not lift heavy things or you would hurt your back? Very few understand why, and how it hurts your back, and underestimate the multi-year recovery process.

I read back mechanic to this subs suggestion, and my main takeaways were to walk, strengthen core, and avoid pain triggers at all costs. I learned my primary pain trigger was spinal flexion, and bending forward at the hips. This meant I could not be sitting, desk working, driving, flying, dining, biking, using the bathroom, etc.

**Strategies**

Fortunately I lived in NYC, and was able to put these principles into practice, in order of importance

* Walking >10km a day
   * I feel running puts pressure on discs
   * Put my hands interlocked behind back while walking, helped with posture
   * Avoided intense hip/leg exercises like squats, made pain worse for me
   * Continued upper body weight exercise, primarily pull ups. Dead hangs helped with spinal decompression
   * mcgill big 3, planks
* SLEEP
   * Bad sleep was the worst thing to come out of this condition. Sleeping on any side was bad. Sleeping on stomach was best for disc, but generally uncomfortable. Sleeping on back was tolerable for 4 hours, then I would wake up every 2 hours in pain and need to lie on my stomach for 30 minutes before returning.
   * The reason the pain increases while back sleeping is your discs slowly dehydrate overnight, and the loss of volume increases the herniation which presses the sciatic nerve. Stomach lying is comfortable because your spine is in slight extension.
   * To sleep on my back comfortably, I had to put my spine in constant extension, and I found a method I don't see on this sub. Roll a towel and put it under your tail bone. The worse the herniation, the bigger the towel/pillow you need underneath. The softer the mattress, the more the towel sinks into the bed and have less effect on your spine, so have a hard mattress or use more towels in this case.
      * This strategy was crucial to regaining work performance
* Spend entire day standing, or lying on stomach
   * NYC subway lets you stand during commute
   * Managed to find a wework with standing desks (rare)
      * Would kneel on the chair when I got tired
      * Was hard to focus at first, became alot easier as my core got strong
   * EOD would lounge on stomach on bed with laptop
      * puts alot of pressure on elbow ulnar nerve, experiment with position
   * On a standing desk, putting a monitor above eye level will force you to look up, and discourage slouching.
   * For laptop only work, I purchased a roostv3 laptop stand. Marginal improvement to posture imo.
* DIET
   * No alcohol, consistent pain the next day if I consumed
   * Trimmed caffeine consumption, felt that the dehydrating effects would be bad
      * I use hario-switch drip. I progressively mixed more decaf into grinds.
   * General non-inflammatory diet \[latter end of journey\]
      * Spinach, frozen blueberry, oatmeal smoothie
      * Chicken breast, or wild salmon
* DECOMPRESSION/TRACTION
   * deadhangs are good, but hard to do long
   * Inversion tables work but I found it pools too much blood in my head and is uncomfortable after 5 min
   * I got something called a back bubble that let me hang upright and decompress my spine. I hooked it up to a pull up bar. Felt good, but not entirely sold on its benefits. Overpriced
   * I think getting a proper machine would be beneficial like VAX-D, but I never had access to one.

**Regression**

After 4 months I was pretty healthy but not entirely cured. I could sit for maybe 30 mins comfortably.

My family lives in Korea and I visit them annually at Christmas. I did not want to miss this Christmas and figured I could tolerate a 15 hour flight in economy as long as I walked around the plane and took some pain killers. Coincidentally 1 day before the flight, my wisdom tooth pain flared up, and I figured I could survive to get it dealt with in Korea's superior healthcare.

That flight is the most painful experience in my life. There is no easy way to stay in spinal extension when you are in a chair for 15 hours. I would walk around the cabin, but eventually flight staff would tell me to sit due to turbulence. The recline in economy is non-existent, and the pain in my tooth was excruciating. I took a bunch of a painkillers which numbed the tooth, but my glute pain was still at a 5.

I survived the flight, went home, dealt with 2 wisdom teeth in 15 minutes at a specialized clinic, went to bed. When I woke up, I had no feeling in my ring and pinky toe, and my symptoms were way worse than they were before, pain at 8. I felt that I had erased 4 months of progress. I regained feeling in my toes a week later.

I visited couple doctors, one said that I had to have an immediate microdisectomy, and the other said I'm still young and it could heal. MRI was around $400 here (non-resident, no insurance). I remember reading in back mechanic how most surgery patients end up still having pain, so I decided to abstain, not wanting to permanently remove a portion of my disc. The doctors prescribed me strong painkillers, the korean equivalent of percocets. 

I did two epidural shots, and an acupuncture session in Korea. The pain relief was short term.

**On Painkillers**

I had to return to work. I spent 3k to get a business class seat. Business class seats do not full 180 degree recline, so to travel comfortably I spent 90% of that flight on my stomach. Despite taking the percs and business, the pain got slightly worse after that flight due to the small amount of sitting in the plane and to/from the airport driving.

I continued with my routine, and took the percs daily. I felt amazing on them, but would get constipation. The rappers don't seem to acknowledge that lol. I could sit long 3 hours with them, but the pain would return worse than before. I realized here that painkillers do not heal, they just mask symptoms, and we need to have painful symptoms to discourage bad movements. I threw away the percs to face the pain directly, and because I felt I could develop an addiction.

**Recovery**

NYC is expensive and cold at this period. I couldn't walk as long comfortably. My short term lease had ended, and my savings were thin. I decided it'd be best to move to west LA in with my sibling. I liquidated everything and moved to LA where the weather was perfect for walking all year round. I turned 23.

The sunny weather made me happy, I worked remotely so I didn't have to drive, I was saving a good amount in rent, I was able to walk in perpetual 20C weather. It was alot quieter than NYC and my sleep was better. I ate alot healthier because I had to cook groceries instead of spontaneously walking out for fast food in NYC. I got a raise at work. 8 months of this and I could now sit 1 hour comfortably, still standing most of the day.

There were some setbacks to the healing process. I would drive sometimes to eat out at restaurants, and LA gets terrible traffic. One time I went to the golf range thinking that its a low intensive sport, but I learned quick spine twists are terrible for your back. I lost feeling in my ring/pinky toe for 2 days.

**Regression 2**

Due to personal reasons, I had to get my own place again. I moved to a new place that seemed nice, but was considerably worse than before. It was a furnished apartment, which I wanted due to the hassle free moving process, but the bed was very soft. These suburbs were surprisingly noisy, due to hellcats at midnight. The gym was far away, and the weather was extremely hot in August which discouraged me from walking. I could not find a good routine here. My body did not like the mattress even with the towel strategy. My sleep deteriorated, I did not walk consistently, and I could not perform at work again.

I was fired from my job due to performance shortly after. I had used up alot of vacation, and the constant moving messed with my routines. Independent of my disc issues, the startup was fast paced, high demand, and well paying so I understood their decision. Having to perform while fighting my herniated disc was extremely stressful the past year.

I cancelled the lease to the noisy apartment, and went on a one-way to Korea, spending 4k on business again. I figured I'd save on rent by staying at my parents, and focus on healing full time. If I wanted to do anything medical, like an MD, I could do the operation in Korea for cheap. After the chiropracter/PT/MRI costs & quality I lost faith in US healthcare.

**Breakthrough & Present day**

Within 1 week of losing the job and resting in Korea, my pain dropped significantly. I could now sit for 2 hours, and I could sleep in any position I wanted without needing a towel. I traveled Seoul/Tokyo back and forth, a 2 hour economy leg without any hassle. I learned here that something as simple as stress could be the main obstacle to healing your disc.

To get back to 100% will likely require another year. I still do not think I can fly economy to the US without suffering a regression, but I feel I can sit long enough to function in an office setting again.

My routine now consists of no alarm sleep (\~9 hours), hiking a mountain for 2 hours, coding personal projects, pull ups, core & hip mobility exercises, decaf coffee, no alcohol, low-inflammation diet. Good sleep makes me less hungry. I'm 180cm 23M at 80kg now at 75kg.

**Learnings**

* Respect pain triggers and avoid them
   * This is general life advice, pain occurs to discourage bad decisions
   * Painkillers are unhealthy, addictive, and maladaptive
   * We will do things that make your disc regress, whats important is to remember the consequences
      * I know drinking worsens my disc, but I calculate that the pain is worth enjoying a beer with my father.
* Adapt to your situation and act immediately
   * It took me 2 months to diagnose and get into my disc healing routine.
   * I imagine I'd be 100% right now if I acted within a week of symptoms
* Manage stress
   * I know its ridiculous to tell you to quit your jobs, but my pain went down 80% when I stopped working.
* Have gratitude that you know these preventative measures now rather than later
   * 40% of people face sciatica. Lifting something heavy is a universal, and timeless task.
      * literally in the bible
* Hire movers, and LIFT WITH YOUR LEGS!!!",11,1731651996.0,Sciatica,1,1.0,False

* **Upsell**: A $297 online course with 10 modules.
* **Downsell**: A $97 mini-course with 3 modules from the full course.

# Step 4: Add the Downsell Product

1. **Set Up the Product**:
   * Go to the downsell page and click¬†**‚ÄúProducts‚Äù**¬†\>¬†**‚ÄúAdd Product.‚Äù**
   * Input product details:
      * Product Name: ‚ÄúMini Course.‚Äù
      * Price: $97.
      * Payment Integration: Connect with Stripe, PayPal, or other gateways.
2. **Enable One-Click Purchase**:
   * Ensure the initial checkout page captures payment details for seamless one-click downsell functionality.

# Step 5: Configure the Funnel Logic

1. **Set Conditional Steps**:
   * ClickFunnels allows you to redirect users based on their choice at the upsell step.
   * **If Declined**: Redirect to the downsell page.
   * **If Accepted**: Redirect to the next step in your funnel (e.g., a Thank You page or another upsell).

**Example**:

* If the customer declines a $97 upsell, offer them a $47 downsell.
* If the downsell is also declined, proceed to the Thank You page.

# Step 6: Test the Funnel

1. **Test the Flow**:
   * Complete a mock purchase to ensure:
      * The downsell offer appears when the upsell is declined.
      * Payments process correctly.
2. **Optimize**:
   * Review analytics and refine your funnel for better conversions.

# 3. Real-Life Examples

# Example 1: E-Commerce

* **Main Offer**: A $100 premium coffee machine.
* **Upsell**: A $50 coffee grinder.
* **Downsell**: A $20 pack of specialty coffee beans.

# Example 2: Digital Products

# Example 3: SaaS

* **Main Offer**: A $99/month software subscription.
* **Upsell**: A $199/year subscription with bonuses.
* **Downsell**: A $49/month basic plan with fewer features.

# 4. Best Practices for Downsell Offers

1. **Make It Relevant**:
   * Ensure the downsell is connected to the initial offer.
   * Example: If selling a course, offer a smaller module or related ebook.
2. **Price Strategically**:
   * Price the downsell attractively to appeal to hesitant buyers.
   * Typical range: 30-50% of the upsell price.
3. **Create a Sense of Urgency**:
   * Add timers or ‚Äúlimited-time only‚Äù messaging to encourage action.
4. **Use Testimonials and Social Proof**:
   * Include customer reviews to build trust and reduce objections.

I believed him and didn't tell my mom because that would probably cause an argument.
My dad is a really nice and patient person and I've seen those characteristics be kinda off the last few weeks, but I, again, told myself it was because of the stress. Today, however, I went to borrow a backpack from him because mine is broken and he instantly got extremely nervous and stressed. (It was a time in the morning where he is usually not awake yet.) I asked him why he's so stressed and he just waved me off with a ""I don't know"". He unpacked the backpack, but with him standing between the surface he put the insides on and me, so I couldn't see. before he was done he asked me to make him a coffee, which I, at the moment, didn't think anything of. I went out of the room and shortly after he came into the kitchen too to give me the empty backpack.
Now I am a person who's 'main sense' is smell. I know the smell of my home, my friends, my girlfriend, everything. (I just recently figured that not everyone has that apparently?) And I sure as f*ck know the smell of tabac and cigarettes, since my dad only stopped smoking 5 years ago.
I don't judge him for going back to it, I get it, he doesn't have a job right now, my mom is on her stress limit and I'm not really a beam of sunshine either. 
But now I'm struggling because I want to help him and I know that my mom could probably do more then me, like, I'm just a teenager, but she's so stressed already. I want to help him, but I don't want it to turn into a huge argument with my mom screaming at him.
Does anyone have an idea how I can handle the situation?",1,1731651891.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I'm looking for a girl group to do group activities like coffee dates, brunch, dine-out dinners, Christmas market, make gingerbread houses, try new exercise classes, craft activities or even run errands together. 

  
About me:

\-32F  
\-I take my career seriously and am eager to move up into leadership roles, currently exploring an MBA  
\-I love coffee, not for the caffeine but for the taste. I drink coffee at night not in the morning  
\-Aerial arts are my jam: pole dancing and aerial hoop/silks  
\-I really like my Vitamin Sea, I like to swim, paddleboard & went jet skiing for 1st time this year!  
\-Love animals (just lost my dog of 15 years, it's been hard....)  
\-Food is life  
\-I like to be home in my jammies by 1030 PM....then chill at home until 2 AM before tucking in  
\-Child of of immigrants who gave up everything so spoiling them is really important to me

I live in the Burnaby/Coquitlam so I was thinking for  first event, we can try a SPINCO Burnaby class in Madison Centre (4399 BC-7 #108, Burnaby, BC V5C 6R5) on 12/15 Sunday at 11 AM and go for coffee after. It's a month away I know but I have some work travel in between then and this way everyone has plenty of notice. 

I am NOT affiliated with SPINCO I have never been but they have a first time free trial so I'm just trying to make this low barrier to entry with a free event and if the chemistry doesn't work out, well we will have gotten in some good exercise. 

They are very busy so their classes open the Monday for the week of. I can remind everyone on 12/9 when the class opens up.

I am also open to any other type of event if spin is not popular here. 

You will need to make an account to register, I can‚Äôt add pics here. If you need help with the first class free trial registration please msg me maybe I can DM pics that way üòä
