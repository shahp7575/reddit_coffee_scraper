I was also just told this by my ex who broke up with me recently, and we broke no contact to get closure (i know yikes) He's an avoidant attachment and told me that there's nothing wrong with being single forever, and that he's happy doing things alone and that I should get used to do doing the same because I can't rely on others to make me happy. I don't want to be alone. I don't believe that he 100% wants to be alone forever either.

It makes sense if I have been waiting to do something with others and am preventing myself from such experiences by waiting. I should just do that thing by myself if I really want to do that thing.

But then, what are friends and partners for then? Once an individual is so comfortable being alone, why do they need romance? Sex? Friends? 

What makes people go ""Hey, I'm going to get a coffee at that place! Wanna come along?"". It's companionship right? Presence. A bond. Appreciating a person so much that you want them to share in your happiness and experiences. Are there really individuals that want to be alone? That never want to experience this shared happiness and love?

I fairly offended and let him know but the girl I was on a date with handled it well to divert the convo. The barista also noticed as well as we paid and made our drinks for us. The date with the girl still went well but we’re not going to be seeing each other anymore cause of different interests. I did think the barista was cute though. 

The next day I went to target (not that close to the coffee shop) and ran into her in the checkout line. She recognized me, said hi and we briefly talked about the guy and what I do (since ik what she does lol) and our names. We didn’t get to talk long tho and I didn’t get her number. I was thinking about going to the same coffee shop tomorrow (a week from my other date) to talk to her more. Maybe even get her number or ask her out.

Essentially, I am looking for a cute and/or cozy game for laptop or mobile (android). Somethings I've enjoyed in the games I have played are decorating/building and dressing up, farming, collecting, and exploration. I don't really mind a combat-aspect to a game, as long as that isn't the sole purpose of it. I like games that are a bit more storyline or quest based, something that can guide me and help me start out the game. I normally have issues getting into a game because of a lack of direction. I don't have the best laptop I think...? So anything light would be perfect (or if the game is heavy, a recommendation for settings would be good!).

My laptop specs:  
Processor: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1135G7 @ 2.40GHz 2.42 GHz

Installed RAM: 8.00 GB (7.70 GB usable)

System type: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor

Intel(R) Iris(R) Xe Graphics, Total Available Graphics Memory: 4069 MB. Dedicated Video Memory: 128 MB  
\---  
**TLDR over. Next section is basically a bunch of games I've played, what I enjoyed/didn't enjoy, and games that seem interesting to me (it's a bit of a jumbled ramble, sorry).**  
  
**From this, I would love it if you could recommend some more games, or let me know if you think these games are enjoyable/would seem suitable for the type of gameplay I like (please LMK why you did/didn't** **enjoy it)? Thank you so much, sorry in advance LOL.**

Below are some games that I enjoy and why, also some critiques:

* **Minecraft**. I like the building aspect of it. I find it enjoyable to play it with friends on survival servers, or servers like hypixel... but otherwise I never get far in gameplay alone.
* **Dinkum**. I love the exploration, collecting items, decorating, and the overall design/graphics of the game.
* **Dragon Song Tavern**. Recently downloaded the demo so I haven't played much of it, but it's pretty good so far. I love the cooking/running a tavern aspect of it, but it could be a bit more intuitive/have more depth to it. 
* **House Flipper**. I love decorating and building... what can I say.
* **Stardew Valley**. I used to not be able to get into this game AT ALL, but I played it with my friends and loved it. I think I had trouble getting into it/understanding it because there wasn't too much guidance on how to start out? I really love the farming, collecting, exploring, and storylines (also the romance). The pacing/time cycle isn't my fav, and I don't really enjoy how long it takes to water plants, etc. Can't get much done in one game day. Art style is also amazing.
* **Sims 4**. Love, love, love creating sims and building. I spend the majority of my time in create-a-sim (especially with the CC I have). I'm not tooo keen on the gameplay unless I am following some type of legacy/gameplay challenge.
* **Disney Dreamlight Valley**. Literally love everything about this game. It's THE game for me.
* **Youtuber's Life 2**. Only played a tiny bit so far, but it seems pretty good. Love the graphics/design, and the storylines it seems to have with the NPCs?
* (on android/mobile) **Pixel Paradise/Viladia**. Once again, love the decorating. Cute little farming/cooking game, very basic... but I love collecting the items and trying to fulfill orders.
* (on android/mobile) **SuitU**. Dress-up game where you can enter competitions, roll gacha, and they some little events.
* (on android/mobile) **My Little Pony**. My entire childhood... Love collecting the ponies and decorating my town... but there isn't really much to do outside of that when you have progressed far. There are events and minigames and stuff which are nice. 
* (on switch) **ACNH**. So so cute. Love the decorating and dress up, as well as collecting. The characters are so cute. Bit long to get into it, and I didn't really like how it adapted to real-time. Building mechanics (terraforming etc.) aren't the best, and a very long process.

Games I haven't played much of, but really like the overall concept and design:

* Paleo Pines.
* Fae Farm.

Games I couldn't really get into:

* **Terraria**. Was very much like a 'find-out yourself' game, more so than Minecraft. Didn't really enjoy the graphics/design too much.
* **Coral Island**. Can't really say why I didn't enjoy this... I just didn't... I might be willing to give it another chance...?
* **My Time at Portia**. Couldn't really get into it... I literally got confused within 10-20min of playing... might just be a me problem.

Games on my wishlist that I would most likely get:

* **Hello Kitty Island Adventure**. Literally looks so cute + it's sanrio.. hello? Haven't explored the gameplay too much.
* **Go-go Town!** Made by the same people as Dinkum, so I think I would like it..? Haven't really looked into gameplay much though.

Games on my wishlist that look interesting/that I have the demos for (but haven't played):

* **Book Bound**. Book related.. I love books.
* **Locomoto**. Looks very cute and relaxing.
* **Moonlight Peaks**. The design and atmosphere remind me a lot of Dreamlight Valley. Love the fantasy/supernatural aspect.
* **Moonstone Island**. Reminds me of Stardew Valley but with a more magical aspect. Looks to have a card/battle based aspect to it? I'm not really keen on that/interested in it so it's putting me off the game a bit.
* **Potion Permit**. Seems to have a collection/crafting aspect? Very interesting.
* **Solarpunk**. Love the design and art to it, not to keen about the technological aspect.. as long as it isn't something overtly complicated.
* **Squirrelled Away**. Hello....?? I'm a squirrel.. nothing more to say.
* Sugardew Island. 
* Tavern Keeper.
* Urban Jungle
* Paralives.
* **Hokko Life**. Looks similar to ACNH, but has lots of mixed reviews.
* Tiny Glade.
* Song of the Prairie.
* Luma Island.
* Coffee Caravan.
* The Tenants.
* Border Town.
* Checkout: Cashier Simulator.

1k0dfln,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1k0dfln/if_youre_miserable_now_you_are_doing_fire_wrong/,"If you’re miserable now, you are doing FIRE wrong!","Saw someone post that they don’t want to FIRE anymore and they just want to enjoy life and not let their youth pass them by. No shade but just wanna give my advice…

FIRE shouldn’t make you miserable or leave you with regret. This is what happens when you become a penny pinching extremist. I don’t say that as an insult or anything, just being blunt. The little things like getting your nails done and buying $5 coffee instead of $2 coffee is negligible when you’re thinking about investing long term. It makes no difference. I saw this one semi-retired tech guy give this advice, mentioning how he wouldn’t even buy certain name brand products he liked to get to his goal of early retirement. And once he got there he realized those choices didn’t impact his ability to retire early. 

A quick little strategy of mine is finding out how much a certain reoccurring expense (Ex. Buying lunch, streaming service, gym membership) will cost me for the year and if it’s under $1000 I don’t bat an eyelash. Obviously if you’re just signing up for a million things this strategy won’t work. But if you’re already disciplined (too disciplined) in spending, this strategy will help you feel comfortable spending on some things to enjoy yourself.

As many folks have mentioned before, it’s a balance. There  is no point of saving/investing to FIRE if it means you are going to be miserable now. The whole point of FIRE is to avoid misery in the later stages of life and enjoy life. But if you’re sacrificing all of your joy as a young adult to achieve FIRE, you are basically just swapping the misery later in life to this very moment. It kind of defeats the purpose. 

Everyone will have a different FIRE journey. Some people are happy doing this extreme penny pinching. Others spend a bit more liberally knowing it may delay their FIRE a bit. My friends think I’m a total cheapskate because of how I manage my money but I honestly feel like I enjoy myself enough while also investing quite a bit. I would love to see their reaction to some other FIRE folks money management.

Full disclosure, I spent 6 years in university when I really only needed 5 (4 for education and 1 year internship) but I initially planned on doing an advanced degree which is why I needed 5 years of education but once I got a return FT job offer I realized there was no point and dropped out of the advanced degree and basically spent my last semester chilling and enjoying the great social life of university with my friends while doing my 2 remaining courses. Could this time have been spent working and saving/investing money for my FIRE goal? Definitely, but I don’t regret it, that was my favourite year of university. I also delayed starting FT work by 8 months  to work another internship for 4 months to save up for a 4 month trip around the world. I could have made a bunch of money in those 8 months which would have put me in a better position to FIRE faster, but again, I don’t regret it. These were some of the best experiences of my life. It’s moments like these that make FIRE easy for me because I’ve already had a lot of great experiences and I know doing FIRE will not prevent me from having more. For example, before I turn 30, I’m planning on leaving work for a year to just travel the entire world again. This will delay my FIRE goal but again, everyone’s FIRE path is different and this is the path I want to take.

1k0d99d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rosacea/comments/1k0d99d/stimulants_and_rosacea/,Stimulants and rosacea,"Long term rosacea sufferer here. Like all of you it has sent me on a journey of investigating possible causes and treatments. Personally I'm much more interested in finding the cause rather than putting creams on my face or taking medication.
Anyhow, the one thing I have found that has a severe impact are stimulants or other substances that have vasoconsticting or vasodilating effects, particularly caffeine. It makes sense because rosacea is a vascular issue.
Now I love stimulants particularly my morning coffee, but I notice if I abstain my skin gets a lot better, and I get compliments even. 
I have several theories why stimulants cause rosacea. Firstly they mess with your cardio vascular system, causing rebound vasodilation etc.
Also they stop your skin healing by putting you in fight or flight mode. Being tired is GOOD, it means you are healing, and continuously preventing that natural process with stimulants mean non-critical organs such as the skin gets put lower down the bodies priority list and ever heal. 
Stimulants also mess up sleep which is when major skin repair happens.
For me I battle because I love stimulants, but every time I get hooked on them my rosacea gets worse, and every time I quit my skin gets heaps better. ",1,1744782723.0,Rosacea,0,1.0,False

I’ve always been tired.

Not just the “I stayed up too late” tired—but a deep, dragging fatigue that made it hard to get out of bed, focus at work, or enjoy time with my kids. Doctors said I was fine. My blood work was normal. But I knew something was *off*.

I tried supplements, B12 injections, caffeine detoxes. Nothing worked.

Then I read something online: “**Dehydration isn’t just about drinking water—it’s about absorbing it.**” That hit me like a brick. I was drinking water, but maybe… I wasn’t actually absorbing anything from it.

Enter: **Aqua Tower.**

# 🚀 Life-Changing Energy

In just three days of drinking Aqua Tower-filtered water, I felt **brighter**. My mind was clearer. I stopped reaching for coffee at 2PM. And I finally understood what people meant by “natural energy.”

Why? Because Aqua Tower doesn't just purify—it *revitalizes*.

Its multi-stage filtration removes toxins and re-mineralizes the water with magnesium and calcium, improving cellular absorption and hydration.

Suddenly I wasn’t just quenching thirst—I was *fueling* my body.

# More Benefits I Didn’t Expect:

✅ **Better digestion.** My bloating vanished.  
✅ **Weight loss.** No joke—5 pounds melted away in a few weeks.  
✅ **Sharper focus.** I finally crushed that work presentation without brain fog.  
✅ **Deeper sleep.** My REM cycles returned—and I woke up rested.  
✅ **Improved mood.** I felt *light*, optimistic, and happy.

And I didn’t change anything else. Just my water.

I can’t believe how overlooked hydration is. We spend money on skincare, supplements, gym memberships—but if your water isn’t working *with* your body, it’s holding you back.

# Aqua Tower Is the Upgrade Your Body Deserves

It’s not just a filter. It’s a health tool. A daily upgrade. A silent partner that supports your body 24/7. I recommend it to everyone now—coworkers, family, even my chiropractor.

And here’s the kicker: **It paid for itself in 2 months**. No more bottled water. No more fatigue drinks. No more guessing games. Just clean, energized living.

If you’ve been feeling off, tired, or sluggish—don’t write it off as “just life.” Change your water. Change your body. Change *everything*.

Get Aqua Tower. Trust me. You’ll feel the difference.",1,1744782685.0,aliner,2,1.0,False

I used to think all water was the same. If it came out of the tap and looked clear, I assumed it was safe. That is—until my daughter developed chronic skin issues, and our dishes started coming out cloudy no matter how much we scrubbed.

I was doing everything right—buying organic, cooking healthy, keeping our home spotless. But something wasn’t clicking. That’s when I stumbled upon a water test kit and decided to test our tap water out of curiosity. What I discovered horrified me.

Our water was full of **chlorine**, **heavy metals**, and **sediment**. I felt *betrayed*. And suddenly, it made sense—my daughter’s rashes, my brittle hair, even the weird metallic taste in our coffee.

I started researching water purification options and kept seeing one name over and over: **Aqua Tower**.

It looked sleek. The reviews were glowing. But I wanted more than a fancy filter—I needed *transformation*. And let me tell you… **Aqua Tower delivered that and more.**

# 💧 The First Day With Aqua Tower

The moment I turned it on, I could taste the difference. The water was *crisp*, *clean*, and *pure*—not just ""better"" than tap water. It tasted like spring water you'd find bottled for $4 a liter.

Even better?

* My daughter’s skin improved within a week.
* My coffee? Heavenly.
* My dishes came out crystal clear.
* And showers felt *softer*, leaving no residue or dryness.

Aqua Tower is more than a filter. It’s a full-spectrum water purification **powerhouse**. It removes chlorine, fluoride, heavy metals, bacteria, and microplastics—while preserving essential minerals your body *needs*. You’re not just drinking clean water. You’re drinking *smart* water.

# 🌍 Why I’ll Never Go Back

Aqua Tower changed my *entire* perspective on health. It’s not about avoiding bad food—it’s about what goes into your body *every single day*. And water is the foundation of everything.

Now I know: Clean water affects **your skin, your gut, your mood, your sleep**—even your immune system.

With Aqua Tower, I sleep better. My family is healthier. And I have peace of mind knowing I’m protecting them from invisible toxins.

This product isn’t a luxury—it’s a **necessity**. If you care about your health, your kids, or your long-term well-being, you need this in your life.",1,1744782682.0,aliner,2,1.0,False

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.  
  
Then came **Mitolyn**. A **Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function**[,](https://8df33x0djhpx2bvdlkwgzc0z6k.hop.clickbank.net/) energy output, and fat-burning *from the inside out*. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.  
  
So, I decided to go all in.  
  
**I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days** straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.  
  
*Here’s what happened…*  
  
  
**>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.**  
  
**Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula**  
  
As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for *years*, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.  
  
Then I stumbled on **Mitolyn**, and everything about it felt different.  
  
This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. **Mitolyn** was designed around something deeper: **mitochondrial function**—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on **cellular metabolism** and **Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention**. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.  
  
What really hooked me, though, was how **Mitolyn** approached *energy* and *weight loss* as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body *produce energy more efficiently*. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like **PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine**—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.  
  
I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: **“I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”**  
  
So, after reading through pages of **Mitolyn reviews** and checking the brand’s **official website**, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, *no expectations, no pressure*—just 90 days of real testing.  
  
***Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?***  
  
I was about to find out.

**My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review**  
  
When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.  
  
**Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins**  
  
The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, **I noticed less bloating after dinner**, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.  
  
What surprised me most was the **3PM crash** that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.  
  
**Takeaway for Month 1:** Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. **Nothing flashy—but real.**

**Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress**  
  
By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. **My cravings were practically gone**, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.  
  
Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.  
  
By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. **My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper.** And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.  
  
**Takeaway for Month 2:** Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.  
  
  
**>> I GOT 75% OFF FROM THE OFFICIAL MITOLYN SITE—*****NO GIMMICKS, NO SUBSCRIPTION TRAPS***  
  
**Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health**  
  
Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, **my energy was stable from morning to night**. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.  
  
Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). **That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.**  
  
My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. **No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health**, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.  
  
**Takeaway for Month 3:** Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.  
  
  
  
**The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well**  
  
Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: **cellular energy is everything.** The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.  
  
**Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up**  
  
The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to **fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production**, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.  
  
One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients **Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks.** That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.  
  
**Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization**  
  
Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, **Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally**—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.  
  
Translation? **Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.**  
  
**Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity**  
  
Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the **regeneration of mitochondrial DNA**, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.  
  
Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that **participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores** while on a Mitolyn-style stack.  
  
  
  
**Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects**  
  
Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of **systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance**. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.  
  
This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report **improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.**

**What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know**  
  
Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the **extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around.** These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.  
  
One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. **The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times.** I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.  
  
Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. **If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.**  
  
  
  
Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. **It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output**—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.  
  
I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. **That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.**  
  
One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**  
  
Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.  
  
The truth is, **Mitolyn overdelivered.** I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

**Pros and Cons of Mitolyn – An Honest Snapshot**  
  
I’ve now spent 90 days with Mitolyn. I’ve felt its highs and noted its tiny drawbacks. If you're wondering whether it's for you, here’s my honest take.  
  
Let’s start with the pros. **The most obvious win is daily energy.** Mitolyn doesn’t hype you up like caffeine—it smooths out your entire day. There’s no crash, no jitters, just steady fuel that makes you more productive, alert, and clear-headed. For someone juggling work and life, this is a game-changer.  
  
Another massive pro? **The science-backed formulation.** You can tell this isn’t some slapped-together supplement with fluff ingredients. Mitolyn zeroes in on mitochondrial support, metabolism, and inflammation in a way that’s focused and deliberate. It targets root causes, not just symptoms. I appreciated knowing every capsule was doing serious internal work, even when I didn’t “feel” it right away.  
  
There’s also **trust built into the brand**—which matters. Everything from how the website explains the sourcing to how they handle customer service screams integrity. Plus, the transparent return policy and lack of shady upsells gave me peace of mind.  
  
  
  
I also can’t underplay how **natural it feels.** No chemicals, no harsh stimulants, no “detox symptoms.” It slides into your life without disruption, and you forget you’re even taking something until your clothes fit better and your brain works faster.  
  
Now, for the cons. **The price isn’t exactly budget-friendly.** At nearly $69 per bottle if you don’t bulk buy, it’s an investment. I’d argue it’s worth every penny, especially when you factor in skipped coffee runs and fewer doctor visits—but for someone tight on funds, it might sting upfront.  
  
Another minor downside? **Patience is required.** Mitolyn doesn’t promise overnight miracles—and it doesn’t deliver them. You need to stick with it for weeks to start seeing real results. If you're expecting a quick fix, you’ll be disappointed. But if you're committed to real transformation, this will reward you.  
  
Also, **it’s not for everyone.** Some people may not feel dramatic shifts if they already have great metabolic function or a super clean diet. For me, it was revolutionary—but results vary.  
  
That said, I’d do it again. In fact, I just ordered another 6-month supply.

**Who Is Mitolyn Best For? My Honest Opinion**  
  
Let’s cut to the chase. Mitolyn isn’t for everyone—and I mean that in the best way. If you’re chasing overnight results, looking for a stimulant-loaded fat burner, or want something “extreme,” look elsewhere. But if you’re exhausted from trying things that overpromise and underdeliver, and you’re finally ready to support your body from the *inside out*, Mitolyn was made for you.  
  
*I’d recommend Mitolyn for:*  
  


* Men and women 35+ dealing with fatigue that coffee doesn’t fix.  
* Anyone with unexplained weight plateaus even while eating clean.  
* People who’ve felt like their metabolism “slowed down” with age.  
* Those who want more natural energy, not synthetic spikes and crashes.  
* Anyone interested in mitochondrial support, aging better, and optimizing their cellular function.

It’s also ideal for those sick of sugar crash cycles, mood dips, and the feeling that their body is *out of sync*.  
  
*Who shouldn’t try it?* Anyone looking for a “magic pill.” If you’re not willing to take Mitolyn daily, drink some water, and give it 4–6 weeks to ramp up naturally, you probably won’t appreciate what it does. But if you’re patient?  
  
  
  
**How to Use Mitolyn for Maximum Results**  
  
One of the things that surprised me about Mitolyn was how easy it was to integrate into daily life. No elaborate timing. No shakes. No meal replacement bars. Just **take 2 capsules each morning**—ideally 20-30 minutes before breakfast—with a tall glass of water.  
  
*Here’s what I did personally:*  
  


* I took it right after brushing my teeth in the morning.  
* I paired it with a light breakfast (Greek yogurt, eggs, etc.)—never on an empty stomach.  
* I increased my water intake, aiming for 80-100 oz daily.  
* I made light walks a daily habit (20 mins a day made a huge difference by month 2).

Consistency is everything. Mitolyn isn’t an overnight switch—it’s more like a daily charge to your internal battery. I didn’t notice a “jolt” of energy like with caffeine—but I started to feel steady, smooth power throughout the day.  
  
Pro tip: Stay hydrated. This makes the mitochondrial support even more noticeable. Also, I skipped alcohol during the first month, and I swear it boosted results.

**Key Ingredients of Mitolyn – What Makes This Formula So Powerful?**  
  
The true strength of Mitolyn lies in its meticulously curated blend of mitochondria-targeting nutrients. Unlike generic energy supplements, Mitolyn was designed to address the root of fatigue, weight gain, and mental fog by nourishing your cellular powerhouses: the mitochondria. Let’s break down the key ingredients that give this formula its unique edge.  
  
**Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) – The Cellular Spark Plug**  
  
Often called your **“energy ignition molecule,”** CoQ10 plays a critical role in mitochondrial function. This nutrient is naturally produced by your body but declines sharply with age. CoQ10 is essential for ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production—the very currency of energy in your cells.  
  
What makes CoQ10 a powerhouse in Mitolyn is how it supports **efficient fat metabolism**, cardiovascular resilience, and cognitive performance. I personally felt fewer energy crashes by week two, which I attribute to this ingredient kicking in.  
  
**PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone) – The Mitochondrial Multiplier**  
  
PQQ is a lesser-known but **scientifically celebrated nutrient** for its ability to support the *growth of new mitochondria*. In plain terms: it doesn’t just help your existing ones—it can generate *more*.  
  
The studies I reviewed showed PQQ could enhance mental clarity and reduce oxidative stress dramatically. Within the first month, I noticed my brain fog lifting and my morning energy becoming more reliable. PQQ’s inclusion makes Mitolyn stand apart from standard energy boosters.  
  
  
  
**L-Carnitine – The Fat Transporter**  
  
Nicknamed the **“fat taxi,”** L-Carnitine helps shuttle fatty acids into your mitochondria where they’re burned for energy. It’s not just for athletes—this ingredient is crucial for anyone struggling with stubborn weight or sluggish metabolism.  
  
By week four, I was seeing measurable improvements in both endurance and waistline. L-Carnitine made my workouts feel less taxing and helped convert fat into usable fuel more efficiently.  
  
**Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) – The Master Antioxidant**  
  
ALA functions in both fat- and water-soluble environments, which means it protects virtually every cell in your body. More importantly, it **revives other antioxidants like vitamin C and E**, making it a multitasking powerhouse for cellular repair.  
  
Users often underestimate this one, but in my 90-day trial, I credit ALA for the skin clarity and improved sleep I started seeing after month two. It’s the behind-the-scenes protector that keeps your body running clean.  
  
**Magnesium – The Forgotten Metabolic Mineral**  
  
Magnesium is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions, including ATP production and **mitochondrial energy transfer**. It also supports healthy nerve function, hormone regulation, and sleep quality.  
  
I’ve taken standalone magnesium before, but never with such synergy as I felt with Mitolyn. Instead of just calming my muscles at night, it supported *all-day energy flow* without the need for caffeine.  
  
  
  
**Real Customer Reviews: What People Are Saying Online About Mitolyn**  
  
When I first started using Mitolyn, I wasn’t expecting to stumble into a **massive online community of people sharing the same results** I was seeing. Facebook groups, Reddit threads, YouTube comments, even Amazon-style review forums (on third-party health blogs)—Mitolyn wasn’t just some quiet supplement launch. It was gaining traction fast. Why? Because real people were seeing real transformation, and they weren’t afraid to talk about it.  
  
  
“I’ve lost 14 lbs since mid-January and haven’t touched caffeine in a month. Mitolyn is LEGIT. Never had this much energy from a ‘natural’ pill.”  
  
Another post from a fitness Facebook group with over 120K members read:  
  
“Not only did I shed belly fat, but my focus and energy at work are way up. It’s like someone flipped a switch in my body.”  
  
These stories kept popping up—**Some With Pictures, Some With Body Fat % Charts**, and nearly all with a tone of **genuine disbelief that something like Mitolyn could actually work** without stimulant crashes, starvation diets, or endless cardio.  
  
**Common Themes in Mitolyn Reviews:**  
  


* **Sustained, all-day energy** without crashes  
* **Noticeable fat loss** around the midsection, thighs, and arms  
* **Clearer skin and sharper focus** within the first few weeks  
* **Reduced cravings and late-night snacking**
* **Fewer mood swings, better motivation to exercise**
* **Digestive regularity and less bloating**

One user on a forum for women over 40 wrote:  
  
“I didn’t change much, but Mitolyn turned my 2pm fog into creative time. Lost 9 lbs already, and my husband just ordered his own bottle.”  
  
Another quote from an IG comment thread:  
  
“I’ve never stuck with a supplement for more than 3 weeks. Mitolyn? I’m on month 4. It’s not hype—it’s science done right.”  
  
**>>Thousands Are Sharing Their Mitolyn Transformations – Check Them Out Here.**  
  
**Why Mitolyn Works Differently Than Anything You’ve Tried Before**  
  
Here’s what shocked me: Mitolyn doesn’t target surface-level symptoms. It dives deep into cellular energy—the actual *root* of fatigue, weight gain, and mood swings. Most supplements? They load you with stimulants or synthetic junk that tricks your body temporarily.  
  
Mitolyn is different.  
  
It focuses on mitochondrial efficiency—those tiny “power plants” in every cell that produce energy. The older we get, the more sluggish our mitochondria become. Mitolyn’s blend of CoQ10, PQQ, magnesium, and adaptogens revives them gently, steadily, and naturally.  
  
No crash. No dependency. Just internal systems finally *working the way they’re meant to*.  
  
This is why I believe Mitolyn succeeded where everything else failed. I wasn’t covering symptoms—I was *rebuilding energy at the source*. And that changed everything: my digestion, my brain clarity, my motivation to move.  
  
If you’ve been burned by other “miracle” pills, I get it. I was too. But Mitolyn isn’t hype—it’s strategy. It doesn’t scream. It *whispers to your cells* and gets them firing again.  
  
  
  
**The Problem With Traditional Solutions (And How Mitolyn Fixes It)**  
  
Let’s be honest: the weight loss industry is broken. It’s a mess of overpriced cleanses, **synthetic energy pills that fry your nerves**, and diet programs that promote disordered eating. I’ve been through all of it. Detox teas that made me jittery. Keto crash diets that left me bloated and moody. Monthly subscriptions that promised results but delivered nothing but regret and a lighter wallet.  
  
What’s worse? These “solutions” rarely focus on the real issue: **your body’s mitochondrial health**—the root engine of energy, fat burn, and cellular repair.  
  
That’s where Mitolyn changed the game.  
  
It doesn’t hide behind cheap caffeine or fake fillers. It supports your **cellular powerhouses directly**, helping your body burn fat more efficiently, stabilize blood sugar, and unlock clean energy *from within*. No stimulant jitters. No starvation required.  
  
What shocked me is how **Mitolyn actually helped me trust supplements again.** It delivered exactly what the label claimed—nothing more, nothing less—but the results were bigger than any marketing pitch could explain.  
  
For the first time, I wasn’t chasing a high or punishing myself with restrictions. I was just taking two capsules a day and *letting my body do what it was built to do*—heal, burn, and thrive.  
  
So, if you're burned out on gimmicks and magic tricks, **Mitolyn is the smarter path forward.** Cellular-level health isn’t just hype—it’s the science-backed, sustainable way to feel good again.

**Final Verdict on Mitolyn – Is It Worth the Investment?**  
  
After completing a full 90-day journey with Mitolyn, I can say this with total clarity: it’s not just another “energy” or “weight loss” supplement. It’s something deeper. It’s cellular-level support, and for someone like me—who’s tried powders, fat burners, and “biohacks” that never delivered—Mitolyn finally filled the gap.  
  
From week 3, I noticed less fatigue, more clarity, and a level of calm energy I hadn’t felt in years. By month 2, my digestion had balanced out, and I stopped needing naps in the afternoon. And yes—fat loss happened. Not dramatic overnight weight drops, but slow, consistent shedding around the waist, especially in month 3. It was the kind of change that makes you double-check the mirror because your clothes fit looser, your posture is straighter, and you just *feel* lighter.  
  
The return on investment? It’s not just physical. There’s emotional ROI too. Less brain fog means better workdays. Better digestion means better sleep. More energy means I’m finally doing things after work again—real things, not just Netflix on the couch.  
  
Add to that the **90-day money-back guarantee**, and there’s no real risk—just the possibility that this is the one product that *actually works with your body* instead of tricking it.  
  
**FAQs About Mitolyn – What Shoppers Want to Know**  
  
**Q1: How long does it take to see results with Mitolyn?**  
While individual responses vary, most users report noticeable changes in energy and focus within the first 2-3 weeks. Full-body results—including weight changes, stamina, and clarity—typically take 6–8 weeks of consistent use. Mitolyn works gradually by repairing your energy systems from the inside out.  
  
**Q2: Is Mitolyn safe for long-term use?**  
Yes. Mitolyn uses **clinically studied ingredients** that are naturally found in the body or in food sources. Each batch is produced in GMP-certified, FDA-inspected facilities. Long-term use is not only safe but encouraged for sustained benefits in metabolic health, cognition, and fat-burning efficiency.  
  
**Q3: Can Mitolyn be taken with other supplements?**  
Absolutely. Mitolyn is formulated to be **stack-friendly**, meaning you can pair it with probiotics, multivitamins, and other functional blends. However, if you're on prescription medication, especially for heart or thyroid conditions, consult your healthcare provider first.  
  
**Q4: Is Mitolyn suitable for older adults?**  
Yes, especially for individuals over 40 whose mitochondrial activity may have declined. Many Mitolyn reviews specifically mention **renewed vitality in users aged 50 and up**, with notable improvements in stamina and mood.  
  
**Q5: What if it doesn’t work for me?**  
Every purchase is backed by a **100% 90-day money-back guarantee**. If you don’t experience meaningful improvements, simply return the product—used or unused—and get a full refund, no questions asked.  
  
**Q6: How do I use Mitolyn?**  
Take two capsules daily with a meal, preferably in the morning. For best results, **stay consistent** and combine with a clean diet and moderate activity.",1,1744782642.0,aliner,2,1.0,False

2 - 3 years ago now. (Aged 16 - 17). I drunk bleach. This was in an attempt to finish my life.

I am perfectly clean now. In fact now days I am more scared of death than anything.

But could this effect my health? When I took it, I didn’t get medical attention. Weirdly enough didn’t need it. I only remember two times I did try. (There may be more but for the life of me I cant remember). One time almost worked but I actually grew impatient of it and took some more which resulted in my throwing up. (Crazy me being impatient teenager saved my life lol). And once it full on did nothing. This was nothing new. My throat felt like it was on fire. Again nothing new. My dad made me a coffee not knowing what i just did. Funny thing with my dad, he doesn’t have milk with his coffee but I do. So when he put milk in, didn’t put enough in. That hot coffee ended up soothing my throat. And I was fine.

I do remember mixing the stuff with water a lot too. Maybe I added too much water and thats how I ended up being safe. I dont fully understand it. But this was all 2 - 3 years ago now. I have never tried anything like this again. But I worry. Does this have an affect on my future health? Currently I have seen no problems. Mental health ofc take a hit but i am not here asking questions about that. 


I just wanted to say one last time. I am perfectly clean now. I am volunteering, studying to be a film student and looking at starting my own business. I am also dating an amazing girl whos been a huge support to me. 


The only health issue I can find, it seems it causes a higher risk or cancer. I am non smoker, never smoked in my life. Or vaped. I have really bad asthma and dont feel like testing how that would go.

I am also a non drinker. Only drink ive ever had in my life was some water with whiskey (and very small amount of whiskey to the point it was probably more water than anything) when I was 16. Yes that’s against the law. But no one knew what I was doing. It was one time and I never did it again. In fact never drunk anything again for different reasons. 

I hope all this information helps and someone can help me understand all this. When I first made this post I was being dramatic and I was upset. I am doing better atm. And I really just want to understand this. I am trying to get to a place where I can make sense of all my dumb teenage stuff. 

Thank you all.

Whether you're a total newbie or someone who's been trading since Bitcoin was $100, you've probably noticed how overwhelming it is to pick the right tool.

In this review, I’ll break down everything you need to know about **TraderProAI**—what it is, how it works, the features that stand out, and even the stuff that could be better. If you're on the fence about using an AI trading assistant, this might help you decide if TraderProAI is worth your time (and money).

## What is TraderProAI?

**TraderProAI** is an AI-based trading platform designed to help users make smarter and faster trading decisions. It leverages artificial intelligence to analyze real-time market data, identify trends, and provide trade suggestions based on predictive models.

Think of it like having a personal trading assistant that doesn’t sleep and runs on data 24/7. It's not just for crypto either—TraderProAI supports a wide range of asset classes including **stocks**, **forex**, **indices**, and of course, **cryptocurrencies**.

What makes TraderProAI interesting is that it tries to simplify the process of trading for people who aren’t financial experts. So if you’ve ever stared at candlestick charts wondering if you’re reading hieroglyphics, this platform might be your kind of thing.

## Who Created TraderProAI?

The creators of TraderProAI aren’t household names, and that’s pretty common in the trading software space. While there's no Elon Musk-type figure behind it, the platform appears to be developed by a team of fintech professionals, including software engineers and financial analysts.

What matters more is that the platform has similarities with others like **Bitcoin Code**, **Immediate Edge**, and **Bitcoin Era**, which have been around for a while and have built decent reputations. There's no shady history or obvious red flags, but I do wish they were more transparent about their leadership team. It would help build more trust, especially for new users.

## How Does TraderProAI Work?

TraderProAI uses artificial intelligence to scan thousands of data points in real time. It looks at historical data, market trends, social sentiment, and technical indicators. Based on that, the AI generates trade suggestions and signals that users can choose to act on.

Here’s a basic rundown of how the system works:

- **Data Collection**: It pulls in live market data and social media activity.
- **Analysis**: The AI analyzes patterns and uses machine learning to predict potential market moves.
- **Signal Generation**: When the system identifies a trade opportunity, it sends you an alert or executes a trade (if automated trading is enabled).
  
Basically, it’s like having a bot that constantly watches the market so you don’t have to.

## TraderProAI Pros and Cons

Let’s be real—no platform is perfect. Here’s what I liked and didn’t like:

### ✅ Pros:
- **AI-driven insights** that actually feel useful, especially for beginners.
- **Multiple asset support**—not just crypto.
- **User-friendly dashboard** makes everything less overwhelming.
- **Customizable alerts** let you stay in control.
- **Demo account** to test the waters before risking real money.

### ❌ Cons:
- **No mobile app** yet, which is a major bummer.
- **$250 minimum deposit** might be high for some users.

No app? No problem—kind of.

TraderProAI works on pretty much any device with a web browser. That includes:

- **Desktops and laptops** (Windows, macOS)
- **Tablets**
- **Smartphones** (iOS and Android via browser)

But yeah, no dedicated **mobile app**, which feels like a missed opportunity. You can still use it on your phone, and the site is **mobile-optimized**, but an app would make the experience smoother.

TraderProAI is available in **most countries**, with a few exceptions due to legal restrictions.

It’s currently available in:

- **United States**
- **Canada**
- **United Kingdom**
- **Australia**
- **Most of Europe**
- **South Africa**
- **India**, and more.

It’s *not* available in countries like **North Korea**, **Iran**, and possibly **China**—basically anywhere with strict trading or internet laws. Always check the site to confirm if it’s available in your region before signing up.

## TraderProAI – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

TraderProAI’s AI engine crunches real-time market data to give you updates as things happen. It’s like having a Bloomberg Terminal, but without the $20K price tag. This is especially helpful for **crypto traders**, where things move fast and unpredictably.

### User-Friendly Interface

The interface is clean, minimal, and **not overloaded with jargon**. Even if you’ve never traded before, you’ll probably figure it out in 10 minutes. Huge plus for beginners.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there's **no app**, the site works well on mobile browsers. You can trade from your phone while waiting in line for coffee. It’s not the best mobile trading experience I’ve had, but it’s functional.

### Customizable Alerts

This is one of my favorite parts. You can set up **alerts based on price movements, volume changes, or other metrics**. The system sends you a notification when your criteria are met, so you’re not glued to your screen all day.

### Multiple Asset Trading

TraderProAI lets you trade more than just crypto. You also get access to:

- **Forex**
- **Stocks**
- **Indices**
- **Commodities**

That makes it more versatile than most crypto-only platforms.

## Is TraderProAI a Scam?

Short answer: **No**, it doesn’t seem like a scam.

Longer answer: It shares a lot in common with **verified platforms** like Immediate Edge and Bitcoin Era, and I didn’t find any major red flags. Also, the platform has **SSL encryption**, **regulated brokers**, and transparent deposit/withdrawal processes.

That said, always use common sense. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially with AI systems that make predictions—not guarantees.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on TraderProAI?

The **minimum deposit** is **$250 USD**, which is pretty standard for platforms like this.

This money isn’t a fee—it goes into your trading account. You can use it to place trades, and you can withdraw it (or what’s left of it) anytime. Still, I wish they offered a lower entry point for people who just want to test the waters.

### TraderProAI Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7** via:

- **Live Chat**
- **Email Support**

They were responsive when I tested them—got a reply in under 5 minutes via chat. No phone support, but that’s typical for these platforms. Would be cool if they added Telegram or Discord support in the future.

## How do you start trading on TraderProAI?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official TraderProAI website and fill out the basic sign-up form. You’ll need to enter your name, email, and phone number.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once you’re in, you’ll be connected to a broker. This is where you’ll need to **verify your identity** (to comply with KYC regulations) and **deposit the $250** minimum.

### Step 3: Start Trading

After funding, you can start using the platform. You can either **use the demo mode** to practice or go straight into live trading. The AI will generate trade signals, which you can choose to act on manually or let the system auto-trade for you.

## How to Delete a TraderProAI Account?

If you decide it’s not your thing, deleting your account is pretty straightforward.

- Contact customer support via chat or email.
- Request account deletion.
- Make sure you **withdraw any remaining funds** before doing this.

It usually takes 24–48 hours to process.

The screen lit up, cold blue light flickering against the dark. My reflection blinked back at me from the black glass, fractured around the corners. The familiar startup chime played — soft, cheerful, out of place.

The gallery opened.

The first photo was random. A cluttered yard, half-dead grass under a gray sky. A stranger’s house in the background. A place I didn’t recognize.

The next few were the same — random snapshots. Backyards, parking lots, the inside of a car. Blurry, off-center, the kind of photos someone would take while testing a camera out for the first time.

I kept clicking, each photo sliding past like turning pages. Then the world started looking familiar.

A coffee shop I used to visit. Same crack in the window. Same crooked, hand-written “CLOSED MONDAYS” sign taped to the glass.

The street I lived on back home. My old apartment. My car in the driveway, unmistakable in its dented, rust-patched misery.

I clicked faster.

A photo of me — crossing the street, coffee in hand, head tilted down against the rain. I couldn’t remember the day, but the coat I wore was unmistakable.

There were more. Grocery store parking lots, gas stations. My old job’s breakroom window, shot from outside, my shadow visible through the blinds.

And then the photos changed again.

The frame of a house under construction. My house. But these photos weren’t mine.

Men in hard hats walked in and out of the frame, hauling beams and sawing planks. And there, in one of the pictures, standing near the skeleton of my future front porch — was him smiling wide and eagerly with a thumbs up and me in the distance unloading boxes. 

I didn’t need to see his masked face. The shape of him was enough. The stance. The way his shoulders tilted. 

My stomach turned to mush. 

I flipped forward.

Now the photos were from the day of my last hunt. The same boots. The same pack. The same trailhead sign I’d passed that morning, only this time the shot was from behind me — like someone had been walking a few steps back the whole time.

One of the last photos was of the cabin.

But I wasn’t in this one. The angle was from the treeline, framed between two gnarled pines. The cabin looked like a dollhouse. The windows glared with light.

The final photo wasn’t even a picture.

It was a black screen, except for the faint outline of something reflected in the lens - an eye maybe.

And the timestamp wasn’t from the past.

It was from today

I threw the camera against the wall and pressed my face into the cold floor, desperate to feel anything but fear. The chill bit at my skin, but it wasn’t enough to ground me. I stayed like that — folded into myself — for what felt like hours.

At some point I realized I hadn’t even closed my eyes. I’d just been staring, unfocused, locked onto the dull gray texture beneath me. I wasn’t resting. I wasn’t thinking. I was unraveling.

This wasn’t like me. Or maybe it was. How the hell would I know? I’d never been prey before.

The thought burrowed deep, unwelcome but sharp:
Was this how the fox felt when I snapped its picture through the brush?
Did the owl know I was there before the shutter clicked?
Did the sunset care if I captured it, if I pinned it to a frame for the world to admire?

I’d always been the one watching. The one hunting. I never thought about the ones being seen. Maybe this was the price for that.

God, I thought, swallowing back the tremor in my chest. If you can hear me. I’m sorry.

When I finally peeled myself off the floor, I felt hollow. Weak. A poor imitation of the person I’d been before all this. But the need to survive hadn’t vanished. If anything, it burned brighter. I needed food. I needed a weapon. I needed to stop falling apart.

Every door I opened made me flinch. Even the empty rooms felt too full — like something unseen had just slipped out of sight the moment before I entered. I screamed more than once, even when there was nothing there. I was jumpy, raw, stripped of anything resembling bravery.

But I kept moving.

One door opened into something so out of place I thought my brain had finally snapped.

A sleek, modern apartment stretched out before me. White countertops. A bright, clean kitchen. Designer furniture arranged with showroom precision. It smelled like lavender and fabric softener. My mind couldn’t process it — I actually stepped back, glancing behind me.

The hallway was still there. Dim. Rusted. The same metallic walls and flickering lights.

I turned back, heart hammering, and stepped inside. My fingers trailed along the smooth surfaces — the kind of surfaces I hadn’t seen since civilization. The fridge was humming. A faint clock ticked on the wall.

And then I saw the bedroom.

My stomach dropped.

Three children were lying side by side on the bed. All of them small. None of them could’ve been older than ten.

Their skin was pale, too still, too perfect. Their eyes were closed.

For one awful, suspended second, I thought they were dead.

But one of them shifted, almost imperceptibly, breathing soft and shallow — like they’d been sedated.

I stood frozen in the doorway, trying to understand what I was seeing.

Who were they? Why were they here?

I must’ve made a sound — a sharp intake of breath or the creak of the floor under my weight. One of them sat bolt upright, rubbing at their eyes like they’d just woken from the world’s longest nap.

Their voice came out small, hoarse, but steady.

“Are you our new mommy?”

The question hung in the air like smoke. I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. My throat closed up, dry and tight, and all I could do was stare.

The child — a little girl, maybe seven, hair tangled into thin, lifeless strands — tilted her head at me. Her face was blank, like the question wasn’t strange at all. Like this was something normal. Routine.

The other two stirred, shifting under the blankets, but neither woke. The girl slid off the bed, bare feet touching the cold floor without flinching.

“Mommy always comes when the lights flicker.”

Her voice was flat, almost rehearsed. Like she’d said it a thousand times before, each time to someone different.

I wanted to ask what she meant, but my mouth still wouldn’t work. My hands had started trembling again — not the adrenaline-shock kind, but something deeper. Something that felt permanent.

She moved past me, heading toward the kitchen, as casually as if we were in some suburban home and not… this. She opened the fridge. There was food inside. Real food. Milk, eggs, fruit — all perfectly fresh.

She pulled out a bottle of juice and looked over at me.

“Mommy? Aren’t you thirsty?”

I finally managed to shake my head. My voice came out quieter than I expected.

“I’m not your mommy.”

She blinked once, slow and heavy, like that answer didn’t compute. Like it didn’t matter.

“You will be.”

And then, as if the conversation had ended, she went about her morning — pouring juice, humming a tuneless little song under her breath.


As she moved swiftly around the kitchen, the fluorescent light traced the shape of her long dark braid, the freckles dusted across her nose.

I knew that face.

Carrie.

She had Carrie’s face. Her daughter. There was no mistaking it.

My knees buckled and I hit the floor, the weight of it all pressing down until I couldn’t hold it in. I sobbed into my hands, the guilt pouring out of me in broken, shaking breaths.

I’m sorry,” I whispered, over and over. “I’m so, so sorry.”

The little girl stopped and came to me, lifting my face in her small hands with the same soft, gentle touch I’d seen in her mother. She handed me a glass of water, like it was the most normal thing in the world. Like this was how all mothers met their daughters.

The other two had stirred by then, emerging from the bedroom one by one — groggy, barefoot, rubbing their eyes.

The girl with Carrie’s face moved past me, calm and unfazed, and pushed the door I came through behind her. The sound of it clicking into place felt more final than any lock.

Mommy?” a new voice chirped — this one bright, excited, like waking up on Christmas morning. A little redheaded boy grinned from ear to ear. “We got a new one! Yippee!”

My stomach dropped the moment I saw him.

The red hair. The green eyes. That sharp little grin. He was Cricket’s — there was no doubt in my mind. He looked too much like her.

The last child hung back, pale and small, silent. She didn’t speak, didn’t smile. She didn’t look like Carrie, or Cricket. And somehow, that unsettled me more than anything else.

I didn’t know which was worse — the thought that Sam had stolen her, or the thought that she’d belonged to someone else, someone who never made it out either.

I wiped my face and forced myself upright, swallowing the lump in my throat.

“Hey, kiddos,” I said, trying to steady my voice. “I’m not your mommy. But I’m going to look after you, alright? I’ll figure out a way to get us help. I promise.”

The oldest girl’s face hardened the second the words left my mouth. She snatched the water glass from my hands and hurled it against the cabinet, shattering it across the floor.

Without thinking, I scooped the smallest one into my arms, holding her tight so her bare feet wouldn’t find the glass.

The girl — Carrie’s daughter — stood there, glaring at me.

“You are our mommy,” she said flatly. “There’s no getting help. I shut the door.”

Her voice dropped, cold and matter-of-fact.

“We can’t get out. We never get out.”

She turned toward the fridge and opened it like she’d done this a hundred times before.

“Daddy will be here soon. Clean this up. Dinner’s in the freezer. Put it in the pot. Heat it up.”

And just like that, the conversation was over.

I knew what was in the freezer. And I’ll be damned if I feed this girl her own mother.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Stress is a common experience many people face daily, and finding natural ways to manage it has become increasingly popular. Among various wellness trends, mushroom supplements are gaining attention for their potential to support stress relief. But what does the scientific research really say about these natural supplements and their effects on stress? Let’s dive into the evidence to understand how mushroom supplements may impact stress and mental well-being.

### How Mushroom Supplements Are Thought to Work

Mushroom supplements are usually derived from medicinal mushrooms like *Reishi*, *Lion’s Mane*, *Chaga*, and *Cordyceps*. These mushrooms contain bioactive compounds such as polysaccharides, triterpenoids, and antioxidants. Researchers believe these components interact with the body’s nervous and immune systems, potentially affecting stress levels.

One major focus is on adaptogens – natural substances that help the body resist physical, chemical, or biological stressors. Certain mushrooms are classified as adaptogens because preliminary studies suggest they can reduce cortisol, the ""stress hormone,"" and enhance the body’s resilience to stress.

### Key Scientific Findings on Mushroom Supplements and Stress Reduction

Research on mushroom supplements is still emerging but shows promising results. Here are some notable findings:

- **Reishi Mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum):** Several clinical studies indicate that Reishi may have calming effects on the nervous system. It has been shown to reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality, which is closely tied to stress management. In randomized trials, participants taking Reishi reported lower perceived stress scores compared to those taking a placebo.
- **Lion’s Mane (Hericium erinaceus):** Known for its potential cognitive benefits, Lion’s Mane may also influence stress by supporting brain health and reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Animal studies show it promotes nerve growth factor (NGF) production, which helps protect nerve cells and may improve mood regulation.
- **Chaga (Inonotus obliquus):** With high antioxidant content, Chaga supports the body’s defense against oxidative stress, a contributor to chronic stress and inflammation. Research suggests Chaga extracts may modulate immune responses and reduce stress-related damage at the cellular level.
- **Cordyceps (Cordyceps sinensis):** Often used to boost energy and endurance, Cordyceps might reduce fatigue caused by stress. Some studies reveal improvements in physical performance and reduced feelings of tiredness, which may indirectly support better stress management by enhancing overall vitality.
 
### Limitations and Considerations in Research

Despite the encouraging findings, it’s important to recognize that many studies conducted so far have limitations. A number of them are small-scale or use animal models rather than humans, which means more comprehensive clinical trials are needed to confirm these effects conclusively. Also, supplement quality and dosage can vary widely, impacting the results experienced by users.

When selecting mushroom supplements, look for products that have undergone rigorous third-party testing and come with transparent ingredient lists. This helps ensure you receive standardized doses of active compounds shown to be beneficial in studies.

### How You Can Incorporate Mushroom Supplements to Support Stress Relief

If you’re considering mushroom supplements to help with stress, here are some practical tips to keep in mind:

- **Start Slowly:** Begin with a lower dose to see how your body responds.
- **Choose Trusted Brands:** Prioritize supplements with verified quality to avoid contaminants and ensure potency.
- **Combine with Healthy Habits:** Use supplements as a complement to stress management techniques like meditation, exercise, and proper sleep.
- **Consult Professionals:** Talk with a healthcare provider, especially if you have underlying health conditions or take other medications.
 
### Final Insights

Mushroom supplements present an intriguing option for those seeking natural ways to alleviate stress. Scientific evidence points toward potential benefits thanks to their adaptogenic properties and bioactive compounds. While more high-quality human research is necessary to establish firm recommendations, early studies support the idea that mushrooms like Reishi, Lion’s Mane, Chaga, and Cordyceps can play a role in promoting a calmer, more resilient response to stress.

Ultimately, balancing lifestyle choices and incorporating natural supplements thoughtfully can empower you to manage stress effectively. As you explore mushroom supplements, keep an eye on credible research and tailor your approach for the best possible results.

</div>Practical Tips for Incorporating Mushroom Supplements into Your Daily Routine for Better Stress Management
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>If you're exploring natural methods to ease daily stress, mushroom supplements have gained attention for their potential benefits. These supplements often come from varieties like Reishi, Lion’s Mane, Cordyceps, and Chaga—each known for unique compounds that may support your body’s response to stress. Integrating these into your day-to-day life can be simple and effective when done thoughtfully.

### Choosing the Right Mushroom Supplement

Not all mushroom supplements deliver the same effects, especially when it comes to stress relief. **Reishi mushrooms** are a popular option due to their adaptogenic properties, which means they may help your body adapt to stress and balance its internal systems. Meanwhile, **Lion’s Mane** is praised for cognitive support and could indirectly reduce stress by improving focus and mental clarity. Before choosing a supplement, consider these factors:

- **Type of mushroom**: Select based on your specific needs, such as relaxation, focus, or energy.
- **Form of supplement**: Powders, capsules, or tinctures—choose what fits best into your routine.
- **Quality and purity**: Look for products tested for safety, with clear labels on extraction methods and ingredient sourcing.
 
### Mushroom Supplements into Your Morning Routine

Starting your day with a mushroom supplement can set a calm, focused tone. Many people like adding powdered mushroom extracts to their morning beverages. Here’s how to do it:

- **Add mushroom powder to coffee or tea:** A scoop of Reishi or Lion’s Mane powder blends well with hot drinks, making it easy to consume without extra effort.
- **Mix into smoothies:** If you prefer a cooler option, mushroom powders can be stirred into fruit or vegetable smoothies for a nutritious boost.
- **Take capsules:** For convenience, capsules are ready-to-go—perfect for busy mornings or when traveling.
 
### Using Mushroom Supplements to Combat Afternoon Slumps

Stress can build up as the day progresses, leading to reduced productivity and energy. Mushroom supplements like Cordyceps might help increase stamina and reduce fatigue, counteracting these effects. Consider these practical methods:

- **Mid-afternoon tea:** Brew a Cordyceps tea or add its powder to a warm drink to uplift your energy naturally.
- **Snack time capsules:** Incorporate a dose of mushroom capsules with your afternoon snack for an easy stress-fighting habit.
 
### Creating a Relaxing Evening Ritual

Evenings offer a chance to unwind and prepare your mind and body for restful sleep. Reishi mushrooms have traditionally been used to promote calmness and better sleep quality. You can integrate them into your nighttime routine like this:

- **Nighttime tea or latte:** Warm Reishi mushroom tea, sometimes combined with herbs like chamomile, can be soothing before bed.
- **Consistent timing:** Taking your mushroom supplement at the same time each night helps reinforce relaxation cues.
 
### Balancing Mushroom Supplement Intake with Healthy Habits

While mushroom supplements may support stress relief, they work best alongside other stress management strategies. Consider pairing your mushroom intake with:

- **Regular physical activity:** Exercise naturally reduces stress hormones and boosts mood.
- **Mindfulness and meditation:** These practices help calm your mind, improving how you manage stress.
- **Balanced nutrition:** Eating a diet rich in whole foods supports overall health and stress resilience.
 
### Tips for Safe and Effective Use

To maximize the benefits of mushroom supplements and stay safe, keep the following in mind:

- **Consult a healthcare professional:** Especially if you’re pregnant, nursing, or taking medications, check with your doctor before starting mushroom supplements.
- **Start with small doses:** Begin with a low dose to monitor your body’s reaction before increasing.
- **Stay consistent:** Benefits often appear with regular use over weeks rather than immediate effects.
- **Watch for allergies or side effects:** Though rare, some people might experience digestive upset or allergic responses.
 
Mushroom supplements into your daily routine for stress relief doesn’t have to be complicated. By choosing the right type and form, integrating them seamlessly into meals or drinks, and complementing their use with healthy lifestyle habits, you give yourself a natural boost to better manage stress. Remember, the key is consistency combined with mindful self-care to foster a more balanced and relaxed life.

</div>### Conclusion

The growing interest in mushroom supplements as a natural aid for stress relief is supported by promising scientific evidence. Research highlights that certain mushrooms, like reishi, lion’s mane, and cordyceps, contain compounds that may help regulate the body’s response to stress by balancing hormones and supporting brain health. These findings suggest that mushroom supplements can be a useful addition to your wellness toolkit, especially for managing daily stress.

To make the most of these benefits, integrating mushroom supplements into your routine is both simple and effective. Starting with a consistent daily dose—whether in capsule, powder, or tea form—can help you experience steady improvements in mood and stress levels. Pairing supplements with mindfulness practices, regular exercise, and a healthy diet enhances their impact, promoting overall mental and physical wellbeing.

While mushroom supplements are not a cure-all, they offer a natural option that many find helpful for managing stress. Listening to your body and consulting with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement is key to ensuring safety and effectiveness.

By combining the scientific insights with practical habits, you can create a balanced approach to stress relief that supports your health both today and in the long run.

“I want a divorce.” I said, but there was no response.
“I said I want a divorce.” I repeated louder this time, clenching my fists at my sides.
Alpha Dante finally looked up from his desk, staring at me like I had come to throw another tantrum.
“You are tired. Go and have a nap or something,” he said dismissively. I bit down on my lips and, in annoyance, slammed the divorce papers I had secretly gathered on his desk.
“What is this?” he muttered in irritation, flipping through the papers.
“These are the divorce papers. I have my signature already on them. All that’s left is your signature.” His brow furrowed, and his jaw clenched. Then suddenly, he tore the papers into shreds, causing me to gasp.
“What… what do you think you are doing? I spent months gathering that… why would you…”
“I will not divorce!” His voice thundered, causing me to flinch. He tossed the shredded papers across the room. “You are my wife. The Luna of the Moonshade Pack. How dare you ask for a divorce?”
“What more do you want? You’ve caused me nothing but pain for the past three years,” I found myself yelling in anger. “You’ve had your revenge. My father's dead and you took over his pack. What more do you want? Why won’t you let me go? Why…”
“It’s not enough!” he cut me off. “Your pain is not enough! You cannot be happy while I am unhappy! You will remain unhappy by my side forever,” he said, now standing, his voice filled with nothing but disdain.
I let out a shaky breath. Who was he? This wasn’t the man I had fallen in love with. This wasn’t the man who held me close on cold nights, who whispered sweet nothings in my ear, who promised to protect me from all harm. No, this was a stranger—a monster wrapped in the same familiar body. I shook my head in disbelief, my heart pounding in my chest. How had we come to this?
“I, Amaya Blackwood…”
“Don’t you dare, Amaya!” he said, taking steps forward while I took more back.
“…of the Moonshade pack reject you…”
“Amaya!” he yelled, closing the distance as I slammed my back against a wall. His hand gripped my jaw, his red eyes glowing as he stared at me while I glared back at him.
“Divorce me, Dante,” I muttered, breathing heavily, but his grip only tightened around my jaw, so tight that it felt like he could actually crush it any moment. “Please… let me go.”
“Never!” he growled. “I will never let you go, Amaya. Even if you hate me.”
We continued staring at each other, panting heavily, until I looked away. Only then did his grip loosen, and he took a step back.
“Now return to your room, and don’t you ever think about something as absurd as divorce again, because it’s never going to happen.”
I paused by the door, my grip tightening around the doorknob, but I said nothing.
As I was returning to my room, I was so lost in thought that I bumped into someone by the stairs.
“Oh, sorry,” I muttered, and when I looked up, I saw that the man I bumped into was Cyrus, the son of my father’s Beta, Vaughn. His father was part of the revolution that had overthrown my father. Unfortunately, before my father was caught, Vaughn was shot in the heart by my father. He did not survive.
“Watch where you are going,” he sneered. I lowered my head and continued walking, but then he added, “The Alpha received a marriage proposal.”
I froze, gripping the hem of my dress.
He continued, “She’s an amazing woman. One of our best warriors. The people love her and approve of them as a couple. Do you know what this means?” He turned to me with a smug look, expecting a disapproving response.
Instead, I smiled warmly. “Ah yes, they do seem like a perfect match. I already asked Dante for a divorce, but he refused. You are his close friend. I am sure you would be able to convince him to take the proposal seriously.”
His smug look faltered, and he looked at me confused. “You are giving up so easily?” he said, and now I was the one who was confused.
“What else can I do? He’s made it clear that I have no say in my own life. If this marriage proposal is what’s best for the pack, who am I to stand in the way?”
He frowned, and when he didn’t say anything else, I turned away.
When I got to my room, I closed the door behind me and let out a shaky breath as I recalled Cyrus’s words.
The pack adored their new Alpha. After all, he had saved them from misfortune. Kara was also everything I wasn’t—strong, beloved, and loyal to the pack. She had fought alongside Dante for the freedom of the pack. It was only natural for them to be together. They were a perfect match, and I was sure the people would pressure Dante to accept.
But what did that mean for me? Would I be finally free? No, that wasn’t possible. I was the last remaining royal bloodline of the Moonshade pack. The people hated me. They wanted me gone, and Dante would never let me go. Even if he moved on, he would keep me as a prisoner.
I sighed and walked over to the window. My eyes widened for a brief moment when I saw Dante and Kara walking side by side. They were talking about something, and he was smiling. But then it all vanished as he shifted his gaze and his eyes met mine.
A shiver ran down my spine, but I couldn’t look away. So we just stared at each other until Kara tugged at his sleeve, urging him to focus on her. He glanced back at her with the same warm smile, and they both walked away.
“Should I jump?” was the first thought that came to my head as soon as they were out of sight. I could run as far as my legs could carry me. But where would I go? Who was I kidding? Dante had allies everywhere while I had no one. My parents were gone, their loyal followers were either scattered or dead. I was alone.
Chapter 2
I woke up the next morning with a very high fever, but I still managed to get out of bed. Outside my bedroom window, I could hear chants from protesters who wanted me gone from the pack. This had become a routine; they did it every morning until they were chased away by the guards.
I got dressed and headed downstairs to join Dante for breakfast. Although I didn’t want to, he had insisted, not giving me much of a choice.
So, against my will, I had to see him every morning before he left the packhouse.
Today was different, though. Kara was sitting at the breakfast table, smiling as she poured Dante a cup of coffee.
“Good morning, Amaya,” she said, as if she wasn’t sitting in my house, at my table, sharing coffee with my husband while I sat at the far end, away from both of them.
“Good morning,” I muttered, keeping my eyes down.
Dante, on the other hand, didn’t look up. He was busy reading something on his tablet.
“Amaya, you look pale,” she added just as I was about to take a bite of my sausage. “Are you not feeling well?”
I looked at her, caught off guard. There was no way she would care. That was confirmed when I saw pity in her eyes, and my walls went back up.
As if on cue, Dante looked up from his tablet, his gaze meeting mine, waiting for my response.
“I…I’m fine,” I muttered.
“If you’re fine, stop sulking,” Dante said coldly.
“Dante,” Kara scolded. “Why are you being harsh? She doesn’t look well.”
“She’s the daughter of a powerful Alpha. I’m sure her wolf will heal her,” he said.
And he would be right, except I had lost contact with my wolf as a result of the trauma. It was like she just vanished. Perhaps that was another reason I couldn’t feel the mate bond, and that was why his words hurt less.
“But…” Kara tried to insist, but he cut her off.
“Fine…I will get the pack healer.”
“No, it’s not necessary. It’s just a fever.” I tried taking a bite of the sausage, but the smell made me nauseous, and I put it back down. “Excuse me,” I said, standing up.
“Where are you going?” Dante asked.
“I’m not hungry,” I replied. Not waiting for his response, I turned and walked out of the dining room.
In the corner, I could see some maids giggling as I walked by. I knew it was about me, but I could do nothing but continue walking.
Later that evening, Dante informed me I would be joining him for a party. My dress had already been picked out, and all I had to do was be there, in his words.
It was difficult walking in heels. I had mentioned this in the past, but I guess he had forgotten—or perhaps he only pretended to care back then.
I felt dizzy due to my rising fever, yet I had to shake it off for the sake of this occasion.
As soon as we entered, all eyes fell on us. My hand was wrapped around his, and I could feel my grip tightening because of how nervous I was, which was weird because I was always the confident one.
When we walked in, a man approached us with a smile and extended his hand to Dante.
“Alpha Dante, it’s a pleasure to meet you,” he said while completely ignoring my presence.
“Always good to see you, Mark,” he said, returning the handshake.
I stood there awkwardly as the two men continued to talk. The man didn’t even glance in my direction, making me feel like an outsider.
After a while, I slowly released my grip and took a small step back, then another, until I had created some distance between us—but I could still hear their voices.
“So, Alpha, why didn’t you accept the marriage proposal?” he asked, as if I wasn’t in the room with them.
“I’m not sure where that rumor came from. I already have a wife,” Dante said, laughing, catching me off guard. But I quickly reminded myself it was probably just to save face.
After a while, the show started, and I was back at Dante’s side. It was a live band playing one of my favorite songs. I closed my eyes as memories from years ago flooded back—when I used to perform on stages, traveling on tours. But after the incident, it felt like I lost my voice.
“Luna, didn’t you use to sing?” I heard a voice from among the crowd, and my eyes snapped open.
“Yes! Why don’t you sing for us?” another said.
“Wait…what…I…” I tried to speak, but they cut me off.
“Come on, one song! Don’t be shy. You’ve earned many awards for your singing.”
It was true, but right now, I couldn’t.
Before I could protest, a woman grabbed my hand forcefully and pulled me to the stage, handing me a mic.
I stood in front of the stage, staring at the crowd in front of me. This was nothing compared to the hundreds of people I had sung in front of in the past, but back then, they didn’t look at me with such disdain.
“Sing!”
They urged, while my heart raced. In the crowd, I could see Dante staring at me expectantly.
I opened my mouth, but no words came out.
I just couldn’t.
A sudden wave of dizziness hit me, making my body sway slightly. My skin was burning up, but at the same time, I felt so cold that my fingers were trembling.
Gosh, I should have stayed back at home. My head was pounding and my legs felt like they weren’t even mine anymore.
“I…I…sorry. I…” I tried to say, but my vision suddenly blurred, and the next thing I knew, the room was tilting. No, I was falling.
The last thing I saw was an image of Dante’s wide eyes as he rushed toward me, but everything went black before I could see if he caught me.
When I opened my eyes, I was lying in my bed.
“Don’t move,” a voice said sternly. It wasn’t Dante’s—it was the pack’s healer.
I blinked, watching him mix something in a small bowl. “You collapsed at the party,” he explained, not looking at me. “I can’t believe the Alpha called me for something so trivial. There are people in this pack who genuinely need my help, not…” his words trailed off.
I stared at the window. My throat was dry, and my head was aching like crazy. I wanted to close my eyes, but the healer continued muttering.
“Honestly, wasting my time on someone who’s probably just fine. It’s not like I have better things to do,” he said, as if I wasn’t lying right next to him.
The room fell silent. After a few minutes, the door opened, and Dante stepped in.
“What happened?” he asked the healer.
“Nothing serious,” the healer said, waving his hand dismissively. “She’s been indoors too much. Likely a mix of stress and low energy. She’ll be fine after some rest and sunlight.”
Dante crossed his arms. “She fainted in the middle of a party. That’s not nothing.”
But the healer only sighed in frustration. “Alpha, I’ve told you what I think. If you don’t trust my judgment, perhaps you’d like to consult someone else. As I said, she just needs rest.”
Dante’s jaw clenched as he thought for a moment. “Leave,” he ordered.
The healer wasted no time gathering his things before leaving the room.
When the door shut, the room fell silent again. I didn’t dare look at Dante—I was still staring at the ceiling—but I could feel his presence close.
“Why didn’t you say anything earlier?” he finally asked.
I closed my eyes as the headache worsened.
“I’m fine,” I whispered.
There was another wave of silence between us until I heard his footsteps retreating, followed by the door closing. Only then did I open my eyes.
I managed to sit up and opened my drawer, picking up a bag containing pills. I grabbed the bottled water I always had next to my bed and gulped down the medicine.
Without taking this, I wouldn’t be able to sleep.
Chapter 3
The next days that followed, I started noticing Dante more often in the house than before. Although we never truly had a proper conversation, he wasn’t yelling like he used to.
“My husband has been really cold and distant lately.”
I overheard a conversation between two maids while I was walking down the hallway. They were whispering, but I could hear them clearly.
“Do you have a child yet?” the older maid asked while the younger one shook her head.
“I wanted to wait, but now… I don’t know. Maybe it was a mistake. He’s barely home, and when he is, it feels like we’re strangers.”
“Ah, that’s just what happens with newlyweds. Men get restless, but trust me, once you give him a child, everything will change. He’ll return to his loving self. That’s how it’s always been.”
I froze upon hearing those words. A child? Was that the answer?
But Dante had never asked for one, which is why I never even considered it.
But now… maybe… just maybe.
That night, I found myself standing in front of Dante’s office, debating whether to knock or not. Just then, the door opened, and he stepped out. He looked surprised when he saw me there.
His gaze shifted from my head to my toes. I was wearing a slightly transparent nightgown, but at the last minute, I had thrown a robe over it.
“Dante,” I whispered. “Are you busy?”
We had done this many times in the past. Whenever he wanted it, he would come to my room. But for the past year, he had stopped coming. I assumed he had grown tired of me. So, I never made a move—until now.
“If you are not busy, I was thinking…” I tugged on his shirt, silently praying he wouldn’t reject me.
To my surprise, he grabbed my wrist and pulled me inside, shutting the door behind him with a quiet click. My heart pounded in my chest.
I reached for the tie of my robe, but before I could even pull it off, his lips crashed onto mine.
He gripped me firmly, holding me in place as his mouth moved against mine.
It felt like he was desperate. But even then… his kiss felt cold.
Before I could even think, his hands were already at the tie of my robe, and it pulled open. It fell from my shoulders, and I stood there in just my nightgown and nothing underneath.
He didn’t waste time, grabbing the hem of my nightgown and pulling it over my head.
Now I was standing before him, nervously fidgeting with my fingers.
His eyes darkened for a brief second before his expression went blank again.
“Lie down,” he commanded.
Without a second thought, I moved toward the bed, doing exactly what he told me to.
The next morning, when I woke up, I was sore all over. Dante wasn’t in the room. He had left that same night as soon as he was done.
Gosh, I regretted it instantly.
Last night, although filled with pleasure, was emotionless. He didn’t utter a single word or make a single sound.
Even when he released inside of me. Nothing. It felt like a machine doing its job, even worse than before.
It took me a while to pick myself up and return to my room. And after that day, I saw less and less of Dante.
He was always busy with work and even missed our usual morning breakfasts together.
Two months passed in the blink of an eye, and nothing really changed.
“I want to go to the beach,” I suddenly brought it up during breakfast.
“I will arrange for us to go this weekend,” he said, looking at his phone.
“No… just me. I want to go alone,” I said, and his eyes instantly snapped up to meet mine.
“You want to go alone?” he repeated. “Why? Who do you want to meet?”
“Why do you assume I want to meet someone?” I asked, but I was met with a cold glare, causing me to swallow nothing.
“I heard your friend is in town.”
He was talking about Ryder, my childhood best friend who had confessed his love to me in the past, but I had turned him down to be with Dante. Although I was aware he was in town, he still wasn’t the reason I was going to the beach.
“I just want some time alone. I have been locked inside for too long. Didn’t the healer say that I needed more sunlight and fresh air?” I reminded him.
He glared at me, then nodded. “Fine, I will make arrangements for a guard to accompany you.”
Even though I wanted to argue, I knew it was pointless, so I nodded.
That weekend, I went to the beach alone. Well, not alone. The guard was following me but from a distance.
I inhaled the salty air and watched the crashing waves. I played in the sand and picked shells, trying to remind myself of the good old days.
Sitting on the floor, I thought about Dante again. I missed him—or at least the version of him that I had married.
I was so lost in my thoughts that I didn’t notice the guard moving closer.
Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain in my back as a knife was plunged deep into my skin.
I gasped, and before I could scream, he yanked the knife out, whispering, “The Blackwood family deserves to die.”
A shiver ran down my spine, but before I could react, he raised the knife again, preparing to strike.
“Hey!” A fisherman spotted us and shouted, rushing towards us and raising alarm.
The guard, realizing he had been caught, ran away while I collapsed on the floor, struggling to breathe.
“Stay with me, miss,” the fisherman panicked, reaching out for his phone.
Ah! He didn’t recognize me. Thank God. If he did, he would have also left me to die.
But even that didn’t stop me from losing more blood until I lost consciousness.
Chapter 4
Dante’s POV
I was at a pack meeting when I got the call that Amaya had been stabbed—by not just anyone, but one of my own men.
“What?” I barked into the phone, startling the Alphas around me. My heart pounded violently in my chest, and for the first time in years, true fear gripped me.
I left immediately, shifting into my wolf and racing toward the hospital. By the time I arrived, I was breathing heavily, and my hands were shaking.
The doctor was waiting for me.
“The wound was deep,” he started. “She lost a lot of blood. It will take at least a month for her to fully recover.”
I frowned. “A month?” That didn’t make sense. With her wolf, she should be healed in a week at most.
“There’s… something else.” The doctor hesitated.
“Spit it out,” I growled.
“Your wife was weeks pregnant, Alpha… but she lost the child due to the trauma.”
Everything stopped.
A ringing in my ear drowned out all other sound, and my eyes turned red. The doctor’s mouth was still moving, but I couldn’t hear him.
Pregnant? Amaya was pregnant?
My body moved before I could think, and I grabbed the doctor by the collar, slamming him against the wall.
“You’re lying,” I snarled, my claws digging into his chest while my wolf howled in agony, wanting to break free. “She wasn’t pregnant! She would have told me!”
“It’s still in the early stages… she must not have—”
“She did this on purpose, didn’t she?” I cut him off. “She didn’t tell me because she planned to leave! She was going to run off with Ryder, wasn’t she?”
I couldn’t think straight. This was Amaya’s fault. She had been distant, she wanted to go to the beach alone. She had let her guard down…
I shoved the doctor away and turned, my fists clenched so tightly that my nails dug into my skin.
When she woke up, I confronted her about the news, but she just stared at me, emotionless like she usually did. Even now, she felt no remorse. She didn’t shed a single tear, and that annoyed me. I gritted my teeth and stormed out of the room.
The guard who had stabbed her was still on the run, so after she was discharged, I had her quarantined in her room.
She wasn’t allowed to step out for anything, but just in case, I stationed two guards outside and monitored the maids going in and out of her room.
All her meals and drinks had to go through me before they reached her. I wasn’t taking any chances.
If she wanted to act emotionless, fine. But I wasn’t going to let her make another mistake—wasn’t going to let her run away or get the freedom she wanted because of her reckless decisions.
For days, she barely spoke. She ate without complaint, bathed, and slept as if nothing had happened. Her indifference made me angry.
Did she not care that she had lost our child?
As for the guard who had stabbed her, I personally hunted him down.
Kneeling before me, covered in dirt and blood, he trembled as he dared to meet my gaze. His lips quivered as he spoke.
“I was doing you a favor, Alpha,” he choked out. “The Blackwood… they all deserve to die. She’s a—”
I snapped his neck before he could finish. Though I felt I should have tortured him, should have made him suffer, I couldn’t waste another second on a traitor who thought he had the right to decide my fate.
Wiping the blood off my hands, I turned to my men. “Burn his body. Let it be a warning to anyone else who dares to defy me.”
They bowed their heads in obedience, dragging the corpse away.
That night, I headed straight to her room unannounced to deliver the news. She was sitting by the window, staring at the moon, and didn’t turn around when I entered.
“He’s dead,” I said.
She didn’t respond.
I clenched my fists, stepping closer. “I hunted him down myself. Snapped his neck like the traitor he was.”
Still nothing.
My jaw tightened. “Is that all you’re going to do? Just sit there and stare at moon like nothing happened?”
Finally, she turned her head slightly. I flinched when I saw the emptiness in her eyes—she looked like a living corpse.
“What do you want me to say, Alpha?”
“You lost our child,” I growled, taking another step forward. “And you sit here as if you feel nothing.”
Her lips pressed into a thin line. “What do you want me to do? Cry? Scream? You already decided this was my fault.”
I scoffed. “Isn’t it?”
She lowered her head. “Of course. Everything is always my fault.”
My blood boiled, and I grabbed her by the arm, yanking her to her feet. “Don’t play games with me.”
“Then let go.”
I gritted my teeth, staring down at her, but then my eyes widened when my gaze reached her fingers—I saw her ring was missing.
“Your ring… You took it off.”
She looked at her hand, and when she saw it wasn’t there, she muttered, “Oh.”
Oh. Just an oh. Even though I hated her, I never took off my ring. It was the only reminder of what we once shared.
“That’s it?” I snarled. “You take off our bond like it meant nothing, and all you can say is ‘oh’? If you hated me this much, you should have just left.”
Her lips curved into a small, bitter smile. “Didn’t I try?”
“You—”
“But you wouldn’t let me, so why are you surprised? You chained me to you. Did you really think a ring would change that?”
“That’s enough,” I said, shutting my eyes and shoving her back onto the bed. I took a step back, running a hand through my hair. “Put the ring back on.”
“No.”
“That wasn’t a request.”
“I can’t, because I didn’t take it off. It must have fallen off somewhere at the beach,” she said, turning back to face the window.
“I will go search for it,” I said, stepping back and running my hand through my hair.
She didn’t answer.
“Go to bed.” I clenched my jaw, and without another word, I left, slamming the door behind me.
Chapter 5
Dante POV
Five Years Ago – Flashback
“Did you sleep well?” I asked, running my fingers through Amaya’s silky hair as her head rested on my lap.
“No,” she pouted, turning her face up to look at me.
I smirked, brushing a loose strand behind her ear. “And why is that, princess?”
She huffed dramatically. “Because you weren’t there.”
It had only been a short mission—three days at the border—but she acted as if I had been gone for months.
I chuckled, trailing my fingers down her jaw. “I told you I’d come back.”
“You’re always leaving,” she muttered, crossing her arms. “And one day, you won’t.”
My smirk faltered. Amaya was the Alpha’s only daughter, raised in the safety of the packhouse, protected like an egg. She had never known real war, real danger. And yet, she feared losing me more than anything.
I gently tilted her chin up, forcing her to meet my gaze. “I will always come back to you.”
She blinked, her emerald eyes searching mine for a moment before she whispered, “Promise?”
I leaned down, brushing my lips against her forehead. “I swear it.”
A small smile tugged at her lips, but I could still see the hesitation in her eyes. She didn’t like my life as a soldier, didn’t like the bloodshed or the risks. But she loved me enough to endure it.
“Come with me next time,” she said, catching me off guard.
I raised a brow. “What?”
“On your next mission,” she said, propping herself up on her elbows. “I want to see what it’s like.”
I laughed, shaking my head. “Absolutely not.”
She scowled. “Why not?”
“Because you’re the Alpha’s daughter,” I reminded her. “And your father would have my head if I let you anywhere near danger.”
She rolled her eyes. “I’m not a child, Dante.”
“No, but you’re my princess,” I murmured, pressing a kiss to her palm. “And I won’t let anything happen to you.”
She sighed in frustration but didn’t argue further. Instead, she curled up against me, resting her head on my chest.
“Then don’t take so long next time,” she whispered, and I wrapped my arms around her, inhaling the familiar scent of lavender and honey.
End of Flashback
Ding!
Ding!
My phone vibrated, startling me out of my sleep. My neck was sore as I had dozed off at my desk. Glancing at my phone, I saw a message from Amaya.
I frowned.
“I’m sorry.”
I scoffed.
Sorry? She was apologizing? She should have done that sooner and made things easier for both of us, but she just had to be so stubborn.
I picked up my pen to continue signing some documents. But then 10 minutes passed and I found myself just flipping the pages.
“She never apologizes,” Mako, my wolf, said, and my hand froze.
It was true. Amaya had never been one to admit when she was wrong, even in the past. She had always been proud, but more than that, she had always been distant, keeping her emotions hidden.
Something wasn’t right.
I immediately grabbed my phone to call her, but the line went straight to voicemail.
I got up from my desk and sped past the hallway. There was no way she would have run away. She wouldn’t. She wouldn’t… she couldn’t.
When I got to her room, I saw two guards standing outside.
“Has she left her room?” was the first thing I asked.
“No, Alpha. In fact, she has been asleep for a while now. Told us not to disturb her,” one of them replied, and I sighed in relief.
Well, that was good. At least she was actually apologizing, but why did I still feel uneasy?
She hadn’t left. She was still here. But why wasn’t she answering me?
I opened the door, and the moment I stepped inside, I saw her lying in her bed. I breathed another sigh of relief.
“Something feels off,” Mako said.
I walked closer to her and bent down beside her bed. When I touched her, her skin was cold, causing me to catch my breath.
“Amaya,” I whispered, shaking her, but there was no response.
“Amaya!” I shouted, shaking her harder, but still, no response. She wasn’t waking up.
“No,” I whispered, backing away as my gaze shifted around the room, trying to pinpoint why—until it landed on her nightstand.
My blood ran cold when I saw them.
Scattered pills.
Not one. Not two. Dozens. And they were all empty.
My body froze as everything came crashing down.
No…
I stumbled back and rushed to her, shaking her violently this time. “Amaya! Wake up!”
My hands were shaking as I checked the pulse in her wrist. I felt a pulse… but it was weak. Too weak.
I turned to the guards at the door.
“Get the healer! Get the doctor, NOW!”
I watched the hours tick by as the healer worked on Amaya’s unconscious form. I stood by her bedside, clenching my fists while my wolf paced recklessly in my mind.
“She’s stable,” the healer finally said, wiping sweat from his brow. “But her body is weak. It will take time before she wakes up, so she must be monitored closely.”
I barely heard the last part before he bowed and left, leaving just the two of us alone.
Right now, she looked so pale… like a ghost. I can’t believe I hadn’t noticed it before.
I grabbed her wrist, feeling her faint pulse.
“Look what you’ve done,” I muttered.
How dare you try to leave me?
“Isn’t this what you wanted?” Mako taunted. “Our mate almost died. Aren’t you supposed to be happy? You wanted this, didn’t you?”
No.
I shook my head. My breathing was becoming heavier, so I had to step back, but I almost stumbled.
“I didn’t want her dead. I just… I just wanted her to suffer by my side.”
She can’t leave me. Never.
I won’t let that happen. [Read more](https://novels-for-all.com/best-novel-platforms)",1,1744780923.0,Novelideas,0,1.0,False

I have been with my boyfriend for 8 months, I love him to pieces. He is genuinely one of the best friends I have ever had, and this is the only secure relationship I have ever had in my life. He is 36 and I am 31. All of my past relationships have been toxic and chaotic, I have a fearful/disorganized attachment style and often seek out chaos.

I get worried often because, I have been told my attachment style is the most difficult to manage, not just for myself but for my partner. My boyfriend has a secure attachment style and at first I was constantly worried he would leave me because I was ""too much"". 

My boyfriend is such a saint with me, he is so patient and loving. In the start of our relationship I remember being so horrified he was going to leave me, and then thinking ""I love him so much I need to leave him before he hurts me, or before I hurt him."" (don't worry, I am in therapy lol).

We also have a language and cultural barrier so sometimes these things get in the way but I am trying so hard and I can see he is too and every time we have a misunderstanding it feels like it's us versus the problem, not me versus him, and once we find a resolution we become even closer. Though sometimes during and after misunderstandings I would feel really anxious, even really small things.

On Sunday we went for lunch at a place we had been talking about for a few days. There was a 30 minute wait. It was hot, I was hungry and I didn't want to stand in this line. He said reluctantly said fine and we went to another place that was not great. I could see him being quiet and I said sorry, said I would pay for it and take him to lunch at the other place next weekend and I would pack a banana in case we had to wait again, he though he said it was okay, I could see he was a irritated by the whole thing, and I said to myself, ""Oh, he will get over it, it's okay, I was being annoying, I said sorry, promised him something nice in the future, it's okay if he's irritated with you, it will pass.""

And then it hit me, I have never once in my life felt that way. A partner was mad at me for something innocuous and I recognized it was silly and trusted in our relationship and was confident it was nothing and would pass. I was almost giddy. This may sound crazy but I have never had this much faith and confidence in a relationship where I allowed someone to be irritated with me and felt secure enough to know it would pass.

The other day I made him breakfast while he was busy with work stuff and he forgot to say ""Thank you"" and after being a little sulky I said I know this is silly, but it would mean a lot to me if you said  thank you for the coffee and breakfast."" And he said sorry very genuinely and that it wasn't silly and saying thank you is important and he appreciates me, etc... I never in my whole life would ever have imagined I would feel secure and confident enough to ask someone that. I have always tried so hard to be ""oh, it's all good"" cool girl. 

Man, it's incredible to have a secure partner to bicker over the silliest most mundane shit with. I fucking love it so much. I love him so much. My therapist told me it's possible to become securely attached in a relationship with a secure person. I believe it's true!

I say great lightly because obviously we have problems, but that’s normal in a relationship. We are about to graduate high school and he wants to leave for the military, or something active duty (not entirely sure) so basically he’ll be leaving in September for a long period of time. 

I absolutely love this man with my whole being and I wouldn’t trade him for the world, but I feel like we need to go our separate ways when he leaves. I know for a fact that if we stay together while he’s off somewhere far away, I will worry about what he’s doing every single second, and it would eat me up inside that I won’t be able to talk to him about things, and if he did potentially do something bad while away, that would shatter my heart.

I want him to live his life and experience things, and possibly mature and figure out who he fully is while he’s away, and I just know I would prevent him from doing that. I would have him stressing out because I would be upset about something, and he wouldn’t be able to talk all the time, and so on and so forth… 

This decision is one I made myself, I have yet to talk to him about it but I plan to this week. I am so scared to tell him because I’m worried he’ll hear what I say and leave me immediately. I don’t want that. I want to spend as much time with him as he can before he leaves, but I would also understand if he didn’t want that after what I have to say

I’m so scared to tell him because I absolutely do not want to lose him and this is my first ever relationship and have never felt the kind of love he gives me, but I know deep down this is the best decision for both of us. Part of me hopes that whenever he comes back from the military/airforce, he’ll still be thinking of me and we could meet for coffee or something. 

I’ve been thinking about this for weeks and it has made me feel horrible because the thought of not having him with me is gut wrenching, but I know this is what has to be done. ",1,1744780409.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

In that time I had an unfortunate series of events and had to temporarily move out of the home I was in. He offered to let me live with him, and while I was hesitant, I didn’t feel I had many options. I moved in with him in February moved out in March, staying a total of about a month.  

During the time I lived with him, he was sweet and thoughtful, and also frightening and abusive. He bought me clothes and took me to nice restaurants, drove me to work, made me coffee every morning, packed me lunches, helped me move, and told me he loved me and wanted to marry me. He would also fly into rages when we would disagree and berate me, keeping me up all night shouting at me and lecturing me. I missed work several times because I wasn’t allowed to sleep, and could not drive myself to work in a sleep-deprived state. When I’ve tried to leave to sleep in my car or find a hotel, he would block me or lock me in rooms, shove me or grab me when I tried to move around him, and take my keys, phone, card, etc.. to prevent me from leaving. His ranting would frequently turn into him following me around his apartment screaming profanities at me, and sometimes included him undressing me and preventing me from getting dressed when the clothes or towel I was wearing were ones he’d bought. He has threatened to sue me for the money he spent on me. Last time I left I called the police. I made the mistake of talking to him to hear his side of things and I reestablished contact with him.  

I’m terrified of him, and I want to leave. But since the last incident he’s been kinder and sweeter and more open with me. I know this is part of the cycle, but part of me questions whether he deserves being abandoned without explanation for the things he did when he’s being so kind now. I feel so awful about my decision, but it doesn’t seem like staying is a reasonable choice. I’m heartbroken, and disappointed in myself for finding myself in this situation, and also afraid of what he may do if I do/don’t speak to him in advance.

My wife and I run a small coffee cart at events like farmers markets, craft fairs, etc. We’ve been using a Bezzera BZ13 DE—it’s been a solid machine, but it has a few limitations. It struggles when we get slammed, the water reservoir is small, and lately we’ve had some electrical issues. So I'm thinking it’s time to upgrade to something a bit more commercial.

Our biggest limitation is space. The BZ13 is the perfect size for our setup, and we can maybe accommodate something 6–7 inches wider and 2–3 inches deeper. Anything larger would require redesigning the cart. Height isn’t an issue.

Here’s what we’re looking for:

* **Power:** 110v is ideal (most events provide power), but we also run a generator that can handle our load, so 220v is doable if needed.
* **Plumbed:** The cart has its own water system (45 PSI, 3.5 GPM, similar to city water). I'd love to avoid refilling a reservoir or emptying a drain tray.
* **Steam power:** Needs to steam milk fast, consistently, and continuously—up to 15 drinks back-to-back.
* **Espresso throughput:** Should handle pulling multiple shots in a row reliably. On that same note, we generally do 80 drinks per event with spikes and lulls in traffic, up to 3 days a week.
* **Single group:** We haven’t needed dual groups, and space wouldn’t really allow it.
* **Reliability/repairability:** We plan to work with a local vendor for maintenance, so we’ll coordinate with them to ensure what we choose is supported. But I'd like something that has a tried and true history of working well.

Our long-term goal is to open a brick-and-mortar shop, but we know the needs will change at that point. If the machine could eventually work in a light-use café setting, that would be a bonus.

**Budget:** $6,000 USD (some flexibility)

We’ve been eyeing the **Rancilio Classe 5 USB Tall (1 group)**, but would love to hear any recommendations or experiences others have had with machines in this category and price point.

Also, bonus likes if you can throw in a good coffee/bagel/breakfast spot on the way back to my hotel (park south) after the run 😁！",1,1744779774.0,RunNYC,2,1.0,False

Yesterday I decided to try my first beer(Ever) after a long time of asking bartenders what beer I should try while also including the things my pallete likes. What'd they always recommend? Guiness!

I went with a Non Alcoholic Guiness in a can as I don't like to get drunk or buzzed on alcohol and I read up that it tastes nearly identical to the alcoholic version. 

Here is my personal review: 

14.9fl oz can Guiness 0 Non Alcoholic Draught

20oz Glass - Poured vigorously at the side then centered (It had about a 1.5 inch head after waiting for it to settle)

Flavors: full tongue bitterness yet light and not overwhelming, bitterness sticks to the back of the tongue for a time after drinking, sweet on the sides of the tongue, soft on the pallete, consistency very close to water. I can definitely see using this as a pallete cleanser!

Personally, I love it! It's like drinking a bitter coffee without worrying about all that pesky caffeine. 

Are there any beers out there you guys might recomend? I'm really big on experience and flavor! This one for a drink is a home run for me... but are there any out there that can be a grand slam...? ",2,1744779374.0,beer,5,0.67,False

It got rid of the brick, works outside US and will atke about similar space as my neo. 
My question is - is the espresso going to be so much better compared to Flair Neo? (i got the non pressurized basket and pressure gauge over the course of past 5 years.  Is the espresso improvement worth the 500$ i am going to spend on it? 

I have tried espresso from starbucks or 1-2 other chains in my country and it didnt taste particularly better than what i can make in neo.. may be its the cheaper coffee they use? 

My one complain with neo - other than manual time needed to heat up teh chamber - is 12.5gm of espresso shots. i sometimes have to amke 2 which doubles the time needed and not something i have the luxury of most days. 

Anyone who updgraded from Neo to Flair 58 that can chime in on their experience from upgrading? Or any other suggestions in this price range? I live in Singapore which limits my options and i use a DF64 upgraded titanium burr grinder if that helps.",1,1744779222.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Dad had it for 15 or 20 years and ultimately it's what killed him.  Right between the trip home last year to get him set up in Hospice and his passing a few days later I had a follow up with my doc.  ""You have Diabetes"" she told me.  In that moment I wasn't able to learn.  It was survival mode for me to get through Dad's funereal and get mom set up and running as a widow.

But now I've got dumb elementary questions.

I check my sugar with the OneTouch Verio Flex because it's bluetooth and has an app.  It also plugs into Apple Health.   One of the things it asks when I check my blood is ""before meal / after meal.""  I was told that ""after meal"" is optimally 1 to 2 hours after eating.  What I've learned about myself from that is that I don't really eat big meals and I kind of graze through out the day - an orange here (cuties), a glass of milk there, Maybe a smoked chicken breast (small) at lunch.  Big bowl of broccoli at dinner.  I'm never more than 1 hour from eating something.  Do I mark these as before or after meals?

And in the morning, sometimes I forget to check my waking blood sugar (symoji) before I have a sip or three of coffee (with creamer - NO SUGAR).  Is that still accurate or no?

Also - Post required flair.  I picked two but not sure if that's accurate or not.  Insulin fatigue gets thrown around a lot at the doctors office.",1,1744779168.0,diabetes,0,0.67,False

1k0caeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1k0caeu/anger_issues/,Anger issues,"Hey guys, it does not please me to say this, I'm embarassed and ashamed of myself, but if I get 7-8 instead of 9-10 hours of sleep too many days out of a week, I get anger issues. Especially if I'm too caffinated, which unfortunately feels like the only thing I can do to survive and get my paycheck. I usually feel very peaceful and easygoing when I know my survival will not depend on me getting to X place by X time, anytime within 3 hours of waking up. 

I've had N1 since I was at least a toddler. I stopped randomly waking up on the ground around 5 or so, and probably haven't randomly woken up after a party was over or in the middle of a meal or something since age 10. Now the worst to fight off sleep attacks are mainly watching TV for too long or being a passenger in a car, or watching really long powerpoints. 

The threat of homelessness keeps me from falling completely asleep at work if it gets too quiet, and I'll just know it's time to stop drinking coffee if I get a super bad panic attack where my hands start tingling and I can't speak properly or I feel like I'm having an out of body experience or something.

I get more sleepy if I stop taking Sunosi, but taking it doesn't free me from sleep attacks potentially becoming a threat to how I'm perceived at work. They won't give my Xywav/Rem because of the risk of depression, and after hearing the psychosis side effect stories too, I'm scared I would probably be one of the unlucky few to have some kind of horrible reaction to it. 

When I wake up, I'm not fully conscious. Sometimes when I hear the alarm, all I can do is open my eyes and stare at the ceiling like a vegetable, and I'm still having dream thoughts for minutes after the alarm starts sometimes. Idk if that's considered sleep paralysis too, because I always assumed that's when you have a hallucination while you can't move like that, which I do get, but less frequently. I continue to have funky disoriented thoughts for about 5 minutes after I can move and turn the alarm off, and then for the next 10 minutes or so after, I'm more in the real vs the dream world, but I'm barely functional. Can barely string together a sentence and am super forgetful. I feel like a toddler who just woke up combined with somebody who took 10 fat bong rips (indica too!!!) that got hit in the head with a shovel and now has a concussion, and even a blink for too long could do me in and get me fired if I don't will away my body's urge to shut back down again. 

It takes 20 minutes or so for me to be able to start thinking about getting ready for the day (I can force myself to get up and start moving and thinking faster, but I'm probably going to forget even more important things than I already do, because it seems like I'm lying to myself with how conscious and ""ready"" I actually am to start getting ready for my day at work.) 

Then I get stomach issues, like the kind you would want to get out of the way while you're not at work, and that usually takes like 20 minutes to resolve, but can also last up to 40 minutes sometimes. It's a roll of the dice.

Then I get in the shower, and I still generally feel okayish, but usually sometime in the shower this horrible frantic anxiety starts to seep in, which turns into anger about legitimately angering situations in my life, mainly that I don't have enough time to get ALL the stuff in my life done/taken care of, and that I constantly have to cut corners/neglect some important stuff just to get the basic things done, like getting to work so I can pay rent/bills and eat food. Sometimes I just get really sad and done with life because I don't even have the time to get to be with my friends, especially when I want to be able to be there for them when stuff is happening in their lives, and that I neglect friendships with my other friends, and it's just this awful harrowing feeling that I'm decaying every day and missing my chances to have the real human experience, which is genuine human relationships that do not depend on money in any kind of way.

Maybe I'm a bit of a clean freak, but I cannot for the life of me understand how people consider themselves to be clean after they take a shower that's 10 minutes or under. Like what do they do in there??? Do they have a buzz cut??? Is their ass crack 1cm deep? Do they just rub a bar of soap vaguely over themselves and call it a wrap? I try to be thorough, but idk maybe I need to bring it up with a therapist that it is very hard for me to actually leave the shower until I actually feel clean, which rubbing a bar of soap all over myself quickly will generally not accomplish.

So then I leave the shower, and I see the time. If I took too long, the panic attack starts right then, and if I have 15 or more minutes left until I have to leave, I am trying to hold myself together, saying you got this, trying to dry my hair and brush my teeth and make sure my hair isn't a rat's nest as quickly as possible. The panic attack is combined with anger and crying. Sometimes I'm mad at myself, and sometimes I'm mad at other factors in my life, and it can be a combo.

I get out of the bathroom thinking I have time to get to work on time, but still, always find a way to misplace something very important, and have to go searching for it, or forget to do something and try as hard as I can to remember what it is, and this usually triggers an even bigger panic attack. Usually the anger issues are directed at the economy sucking so hard it seems illegal to have enough sleep to act the way people expect of me on a work night/day, and that for all of the physical bodily harm I do to myself sacraficing my sleep, feeling absolutely batshit insane from it, JUST for other people to accept me in a way that translates to me being able to pay rent and not live in a tent, they're still gonna judge me, and it seems like there's no winning in life anywhere, as that is reserved for people with a support system, more money, or better health to let them sleep 6 hours a night and be like ""yass, let's get this bread, I'm only a little bit cranky but I can put that thought on the backburner"" because their brain and body isn't actually cannibalizing itself from those hours like mine is.

Then if I have to drive anywhere, it's a nightmare, because I have to park in this stupid public parking lot 3 flights of stairs and a 2-4 minute walk from my car, and my car's usually in a different spot every time, because we have no assigned parking and have to compete with the tourists for parking spots. Then when I start driving to work, I definitely have no sleepy in my system, just a fear of my life being over if I get in trouble at work or get fired for being late, and the dtivers in my area are very unpredictable, because there are lots of old people and tourists, with no passing lanes, and low speed limits. I definitely yell and cry in my car sometimes when I get trapped behind somebody knowing their slow driving is going to make me late, and I'd LOVE to get to work 15 minutes early, but if I sleep 15 minutes less every night, I can barely afford to shave any more off my sleep schedule, and I'm crazy enough on what I get, so I think that would actually make me even more crazy, as I've tried it in the past and that is exactly what happened. And idk how to just go to bed earlier. My to do list is never complete anyway. I just go down it as far as I possibly can every night, before I have no choice but to call it quits and go to bed to avoid being sub 7 hours of sleep level weird at work.

I'm a middle aged female single parent to one child.

I've never received financial help from my daughter's father so over the years have had a minimum of 2 jobs just to get by.

A few years ago I started working night shift at a local Care Home.   It was 2 minutes from where I lived and I could work Friday and Saturday nights which fit in with my other work commitments.  Perfect.

It was a small care home so they only had 2 members of staff on night shift.    Not that the residents ever slept so it was usually busy.    So you soon figure out who is a good person to work with and who isn't.

This is where I met Rebecca.

We really hit it off and asked the manager if we could be rostered to work together.

She is in a relationship, lives with her partner and at the time they had 4 children.    He worked through the day Monday to Friday and she needed to be at home for the children so working weekend night shift suited her situation best.

When it wasn't super busy on shift she would tell me about her life.   It was very apparent that her partner was not a nice person.   

Her partner is my age so quite a few years older than her.

When they met - he was in a relationship with someone else.    It was a cheating situation.

In the first year of their relationship he cheated with someone else and as a result of that has a child with another lady.

He is very controlling financially and she isn't allowed to spend money without him questioning all her purchases.

Financially they are both a mess and without fail every month they need to borrow money alternatively from either his parents or her parents.

Every month they have to take something to the pawn shop.

He has been known to look at porn on his phone in front of their children.

She found dating sites on his phone and he was active on those sites 

She also found conversations on his phone where he was flirting with women and denied he was in a relationship.

They moved 8 hours across the country for his work but he never wanted her to go home or meet up with her childhood friends.   He always accused her of cheating.

He would put her down about her weight and argue about the state of their house.   Though he never helps cook, clean or look after the children.

After she worked a night shift he would never think to maybe take the children out so she could sleep or generally help.

So he isolated her and controlled her.

Obviously I only heard her side of the situation but I never thought he was a prize.

We became firm friends and would often meet up for coffee before work and would speak frequently during the week when we were not at work.

Over time and I am not aware of how or when it happened but I am guilty of emotionally crossing the line.    

I have never had a relationship with someone of the same sex as myself.   But she is such an amazing person, beautiful inside and out that for me, something happened.

I never said anything.  I have never said anything.

I stopped working at that home as a better opportunity came along for me.   We stayed in touch but over time, communicated less.

I moved away.

She recently got in touch to tell me that she was pregnant with her 5th child.

She had again found out that her partner was active on dating sites.   She says that she gave him an ultimatum that she would leave if he didn't stop.

I have never ever suggested she leaves him as she obviously loves this man.

I have talked to her about how much she values herself as I feel that if she loved herself more she would not want to remain in a situation where she was essentially teaching her son's that their fathers behaviour was ok or her daughter's that what they saw was an acceptable way to be treated.

In my delusions I have dreamed of how we could all be a family.   Yes, I know, I am older but not wiser.    

But now a 5th child and still accepting after 15 years of the same demoralising behaviour from him.   

I had to stop talking to her.

I feel horrible because it's not her fault that I fell in love with her but I just can't be her emotional crutch anymore.   For my own sanity, I need to step away.",1,1744778765.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,0.67,False

## Summary

Here’s a quick snapshot of what NeuroTradeX brings to the table:

| Feature | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Platform Type** | AI-powered crypto and asset trading platform |
| **Minimum Deposit** | $250 |
| **Supported Devices** | Desktop, Tablet, Mobile |
| **Availability** | Global (with some restrictions) |
| **Key Features** | Real-time market analysis, mobile access, customizable alerts |
| **Customer Support** | 24/7 via email & live chat |
| **User Interface** | Beginner-friendly |
| **Legitimacy** | Appears legitimate, no red flags found |
| **Ideal For** | Beginners to intermediate traders looking for automation |

## What is NeuroTradeX?

NeuroTradeX is an **automated trading platform** that uses AI algorithms to analyze market trends and execute trades on your behalf. Think of it like having a tireless assistant who’s constantly scanning market data, spotting patterns, and making trades faster than you could manually.

The goal? To help users—especially beginners—leverage the highs and lows of the crypto market without needing to become a full-time trader.

NeuroTradeX doesn’t just stop at crypto either. It also supports other assets like forex and stocks, making it a **multi-asset trading platform**. The idea is to give users a comprehensive tool that takes out the guesswork and emotional bias from trading.

## Who Created NeuroTradeX?

This is where things get a little murky. Like many platforms in the automated trading space, there isn’t a public face or company name that clearly takes credit for NeuroTradeX. This isn’t unusual—similar platforms like Immediate Edge and Bitcoin Code also keep their creators on the down-low.

That said, the platform is backed by a network of brokers and developers who seem to know what they’re doing. The interface is polished, the algorithms run smoothly, and user support actually responds. So while the creators may be in the shadows, the product speaks for itself. Still, I’d love to see more transparency here.

### [🔥 Start Trading with NeuroTradeX Today](https://tinyurl.com/y8wsryd4)
## How Does NeuroTradeX Work?

At its core, NeuroTradeX uses **AI-driven algorithms** to analyze market data in real time. It looks for patterns, predicts price movements, and then executes trades automatically based on your chosen settings. You can also set up things like stop losses, risk levels, and trade limits.

Here’s how it flows:

- You sign up and deposit a minimum of $250.
- You can let the AI trade automatically or switch to manual mode if you want more control.
- The AI scans the market 24/7 and makes trades when it spots opportunities.
- You monitor performance via dashboard stats and adjust settings as needed.

Basically, it’s like having a mini hedge fund manager in your pocket, minus the Wall Street salary.

## NeuroTradeX Pros and Cons

Alright, let’s talk pros and cons. Because no platform is perfect, right?

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Easy to use**, even for beginners
- ✅ **AI-powered trading** that runs 24/7
- ✅ Works on **multiple devices**
- ✅ **Supports multiple assets** (crypto, forex, stocks)
- ✅ Great **customization** for trade settings
- ✅ Responsive **customer support**

**Cons:**

- ❌ Lack of transparency around creators
- ❌ No mobile app (mobile-optimized site only)
- ❌ Minimum deposit of $250 might be steep for some
- ❌ Not available in all countries

If you’re okay with those trade-offs and you’re not expecting it to be a get-rich-quick machine, it’s actually pretty solid.

I didn’t come across any red flags. The platform functions as promised, withdrawals are processed within a reasonable time, and customer support is responsive. That said, it’s still essential to remember that **no trading platform is risk-free**. Market volatility is real, and losses can happen.

So no, it’s not a scam—but you should always do your research and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

### NeuroTradeX Customer Support

Customer support is actually solid. You get 24/7 access via:

I tested the live chat late at night and got a response within 3 minutes. They were polite, helpful, and didn’t try to upsell me anything, which is always appreciated.

Go to the NeuroTradeX website and fill out the sign-up form with your name, email, and phone number. You’ll get a verification link via email.

After email confirmation, you’ll be prompted to deposit the **$250 minimum**. You can use:

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once funded, you can either:

1k0c1gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k0c1gz/do_i_ask_out_my_manager/,Do I ask out my manager?,"Hi there, this is my first time ever posting :). 
I’m sorry that this is long

Okay so a bit of backstory:

We are both the same age, him being 8 months older. We both work at the same place and started at the same time, however have only worked together for just over a year, which is when I met him. He is really cute and good looking, he’s funny, matches my sarcasm , helpful and we have similar music taste which is all a big yes. I did start liking him when I met him and up until November last year , I was pretty sure he had a girlfriend ( he did not ) so I was just chilling at work and acting like nothing was up.

Since December I want to say, I have felt like I got some signs from him that he might like me back, or anything of the sort. Keep in mind I am a bit delusional so it might all just be me exaggerating the signs.

Some of the ‘ signs ‘ I want to say , would include stuff like always saying my name in sentences, he always looks at me when he talks, he’s always smiling when talking to me, I always catch him looking at me , he’s given me rides home after work in which we have had talks and we seem to have similar interests aswell, he’s always the first one to come and help me when I need it at work, and he said to one of my friends ( another coworker ) that he would like a girlfriend and would rather it be someone from where we work as he would get to see her all the time. I am the only one his age who is single. The rest are 2 much younger girls , and the other ones are older married women. He’s not a weirdo or into older women, that I know.

You might think that him saying my name and looking at me while talking and smiling is not a sign, but everyone that I’ve seen him speak to , he doesn’t do that , or does it for about .2 seconds, even customers. We also follow eachother on instagram.

Now the issue….. I might’ve approached him in some sort of way .. had he not been a manager. I’m just really afraid that if I say or do something more than a coworker towards him, he might report me to HR , get me fired and i would have to move to Antarctica because I won’t be able to find a job anywhere else… lol. It’s just really scary.

I’ve spoken to friends and my mother about this, and they all tell me he wouldn’t report me or anything, that he will either say yes or no ( they think he most likely will say yes because they think he might like me, but they are on and off. One of my friends ( different coworker ) said that she sees him looking at me as more than friends whenever I’m around him or walking past.)

They tell me to just ask him out for a coffee or a drink… scary that.

I think it might be a bit of a situation because I’m not part of the management team, which I am working towards and should hopefully be part of soon, but he might not want to do anything because of it.?!?!?!

Please help.. do I ask him out for a coffee… a drink.. what do I dooo??

Edit: oksy thanks for yelling at me. I guess i thought so few calories would be fine on me becsuse years ago i had a conversation with a dude who was big into nutrition and said i could eat way less cause I have epilepsy and going into ketosis would be helpful. Anyways. Im an idiot and am going to go eat a banana.

So back in March I had a very abrupt realization that I had put on quite a bit of weight. I weighed myself while visiting family and was 230 pounds. I realized I needed to make some changes.

I know a big part is my lack of activity. Calories in calories out. I decided to cut calories as much as possible. I only eat dinner (coffee and water durring the day) and maybe a snack. Most days I total around 300-500 calories. 

Obviously I know I can't stay on this calorie limit forever. The plan is to get to under 200, then continue with more calories at a slower rate. I'm at 207 last weigh in. So should only be a few more weeks.

Thing is I'm getting conflicting info if doing this means my metabolism will be shot. Lots of people say starvation mode is a myth. It's all down to calories in calories out. But I'm still seeing some that are basically implying ill need to eat this amount for the rest of my life if I want to get to a healthy weight. So....any insight?",0,1744777583.0,loseit,10,0.27,False

## What is WEEX App?

The **WEEX App** is a trading platform designed to simplify how people buy, sell, and analyze cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Whether you're into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or more niche altcoins, WEEX offers tools to help you spot opportunities and make trades with minimal hassle.

What makes it stand out is its **mix of automation and real-time analytics**. It’s not just a basic wallet or exchange—it’s a full trading suite. For someone like me who doesn’t want to be glued to a computer screen all day, that’s a big plus.

## Who Created WEEX App?

WEEX was developed by a team of crypto enthusiasts and financial tech experts, although the exact individuals behind the platform remain somewhat low-key. The company is registered offshore, which might raise some eyebrows, but that’s actually pretty common in the crypto space.

They’ve apparently been around since **2018**, quietly building a user base through word of mouth and community engagement. The app itself feels like it was designed by people who actually use crypto—not just developers trying to cash in on the trend.

### [🔥 Start Trading with WEEX App Today](https://tinyurl.com/3fxkb6a7)

At its core, WEEX works like most trading platforms: you create an account, deposit funds, and start trading. But the difference lies in **how streamlined the process is**.

1k0bwhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k0bwhl/girlfriend_22f_refuses_to_hold_any_accountability/,Girlfriend (22F refuses to hold any accountability or cooperation and constantly makes fun of me(19M) how can I get her to listen to me?,"For context, me(19m) and my girlfriend (22F) met online and have been dating for over a year. It was rocky at first, as I was still in school and was getting at most a couple hours of sleep while working nights at my job but I love her so we made it work(I work as a chef). It started off with her being genuinely stressed, but taking it out on me and getting mad when I try to listen to her and sympathize. She used to tell me she hated me and would try to break up with me every week but the next day she would act like everything is fine. Eventually I met her family, who like her, aren’t the most caring people if they don’t like like they do(I’ll let you decide what that means) and she is in turn a lot like them. It wasn’t necessarily a bad thing for me at the time, I was blinded by love and thought I could change her. Since then I’ve studied a lot to persuade her to be better but she always blames (insert minority) as the reason why her life “sucks”

After a rocky first few months things genuinely seemed good, although we fought semi-consistently. First she wanted to sleep on call with me, to the point where I had to keep my phone on call while I was at school so she could wake up and I was there. Then she got mad at me for a month because I was uncomfortable with the fact I had to do it, and we haven’t done it since.

I think the biggest problem that has been bothering me is her unwillingness to cooperate. She has to always have her way and will cry and scream if she doesn’t win in a game. For example, me, her, and her brother( who constantly has to be with us, more on that later) play Mario party. If she so much as even slightly believes she is losing or might lose, she will start crying and screaming until we either give up and let her win. This is every single game. I’ve asked her to maybe try being nicer when she wins versus if she loses, and she screamed at me for being an asshole. She was fine 20 minutes later. We played REPO today and she fell in a hole after she already died once and then immediately quit the game, said it was my fault and that I hate women because I leave her alone in the game, and 30 minutes later now she is fine and happy again.

This is where I get into her brother, who I will name james(23). I’ve told her a lot before I don’t like him and he isn’t someone I like(she told the same thing to me about her ex and she said the same thing about his sisters- I forgot to mention she talks about her exes a lot) she then called me stupid and said he was just being funny. When I tell her I’m uncomfortable with him always being with us and us never having any alone time because he is there, she tells me to get a grip. He CONSTANTLY has to be in the same room or call as us. Actually I’m playing REPO for the 5th day in a row because her and her brother love it and I got bored 4 days ago. 
We play well past when I should go to sleep for work, and when I ask her if I can even GO to sleep, she says she stayed up late for me once and that I have to do the same( our jobs are vastly different, she works retail 5-6 hours a day, I am a chef 10-11 hours a day, and she says hers is harder) 

She lists everything even slightly wrong with me( my ADHD, my autism that’s diagnosed, my 
Hair, not straight like her favorite cartoon character she would rather date than me, but curly, the way I talk and act around people, my political alignment, which is anti-establishment but I align more with leftist ideology, meanwhile she is an extreme trumplican with some liberal ideology but refuses to admit anything wrong with her view points)

I’m sorry if this is messy, I’m having a mini panic attack rn and There is so much more I haven’t said but I’m running on 4 coffees and being forced to play this game I don’t want to just because I don’t want to start an argument, I usually stand up for myself but I’m just so tired, I don’t want to be the bad guy again just because I didn’t want to play a boring resource collection game , I want to have her understand how I feel but it’s always about her, I’ve fucked up myself before but I’ve learned from it.
I love her a lot so I don’t want to leave her but I need advice on how to deal with it or how to change her mind.

TLDR: my girlfriend refuses to cooperate or hold accountability for her actions and makes fun of me when I express my discomfort with the actions of her or her family ",1,1744777508.0,relationship_advice,6,0.67,False

I just spent so much money on everything, which is typical for my mania. However, I am extraordinarily depressed. I’m not sure what is going on. I am spending $20 every time I go get coffee and buy fancy color-changing lamps and all these expensive supplements.


I do not feel manic at all. Actually, I had a lot of suicidal ideation recently. Everyone around me thinks I am anxious and I do feel depressed. It is just incredibly overwhelming to have these activities misalign with my mood. This situation is very unsettling for me, and I'm struggling to explain it to others. I considered going to the ER a few times in the past few days to get anxiety medication because I have been experiencing crisis-like symptoms. These usually flare at nighttime. Unfortunately due to my medical trauma, I feel too paranoid asking for help. My mood is so sad and I isolate a lot. I just got my hair cut three different times and have been using a lot of random prn medications and painkillers to sleep. 

I plan to discuss my impulsive actions with my therapist, but I’m unsure of what’s happening, and this is the first time I can’t clearly identify my mood. It's kind of terrifying and I feel really bad about myself. Right now I feel like I'm in a bubble where I simply go to work, sleep, shop, or make very erratic life choices. Nothing is matching up. I would really appreciate any advice on how to cope during this time. Everything is way too overwhelming and I am concerned for myself. ",3,1744777426.0,BipolarReddit,4,1.0,False

It has always been my dream to run my own 80s 90s radio station because I have mas passion for the music and memories from these eras.

First up I started making content. I made 90 min shows and approached multiple radio stations. I ended up having my show syndicated across over 50 stations globally over the space of a year.

Why? I made my shows unique. Products need to be unique to work no matter what you are peddling. Instead of just music I also play TV Themes, old jingles, movie quotes and occasionally even have stars from yesteryear on the show.

This was going well but i wanted to make some money from all my hard work so I decided to create my own radio app. App development is ridiculously expensive but I found a great guy in Pakistan who made my app for 1.5k USD instead of the others who charged 10k plus!

Note, when creating and setting up an app there is a colossal amount of red tape to wade through! Far far more than just making a website.


Anyway, fast forward to now and my station is running well, I play 80s 90s music and memories plus the shows I still syndicate out to the other stations.

I get my income via a single ad which plays when the app opens and also from donations with a buy me a coffee button.

I may be housebound still but I living out a dream which gives me purpose!

I'll state the radio app name in the comments for anyone interested so I dont break any rules.

1k0bt9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1k0bt9d/this_is_miserable/,This is miserable,"Back in January I started having this pain under my left rib and under my sternum with bloating and waves of nausea. I went to the dr who suggested it was my gall bladder. Pain got really bad one night so I went to the er who did the ultrasound and said everything looked normal and labeled it gerd. They told me to take Prilosec in the morning and Pepcid at night. I did and it got a little better but not 100 percent.

Fast forward to March and I’m still feeling miserable to the point sometimes I have difficulty breathing and some heaviness in my chest. I started taking Prilosec in the morning and maximum strength Pepcid at night which ended up giving me oral thrush. I went back to my dr who referred me to a gastroenterologist who ultimately sent me for an endoscopy and upped my Prilosec to 40mg. 

I had the endoscopy today and they said everything looked great. Zero issues. And gave me paperwork for gastritis. 

Nothing is making this better. I’ve noticed if I don’t drink coffee I have left pain but not drinking coffee makes me more miserable than the pain. I guess I’m just at a lost of what to do or what this could be.

I’m sick of being miserable every day.

moreover, does anyone rawdog gym sessions too without any supplements? mine only consists of coffee and a banana. ",2,1744777096.0,workout,8,1.0,False
