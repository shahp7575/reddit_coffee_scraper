1i72nrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Desperate_Pack_9037/comments/1i72nrg/rate_my_college_essay/,Rate my college essay:,"My grandmother has the heart of a lion. Also, a lifetime ban from the Philadelphia Zoo. At least, that's what she tells me. She says I don't pray enough. Maybe that's why my grandfather died. Or maybe it was just his cancer. Who knows.

I remember her apartment. With the cheap tiles, the too-bright fluorescent lights, and the constant hum of the microwave. I remember the couch that swallowed me whole, soft and sagging. Her voice, full of life, full of stories, full of a history I didn‚Äôt understand. We talked for hours over cheap dinners that left a plastic aftertaste. She doesn't remember this, but I do.

She calls me B«ùr≈´k. I call myself Brook. I don‚Äôt even know how to say my own name the way she does, the way it was meant to be said. I've let it slip, letting Brook feel simpler, easier, less heavy with history. But when she says it, full of love and memory, I am reminded that B«ùr≈´k is the name she held before I could, the name she whispered into the quiet the day I was born. I don‚Äôt know if she remembers that day.

My grandmother wants to be cremated when she dies. It'll be my last chance for a smokin' hot bod, she jokes. I laugh, but the sound feels tight. I don't want to think about her dying. But she says not to worry, and that she will go to heaven. I wish I believed her. I wish I believed in God. My family does. But that‚Äôs because we‚Äôre Ethiopian. It‚Äôs tradition and identity.

She smells like coffee. Always. The sharp scent of roasted beans clings to her sweaters, her skin. At home, the «ß√§b√§na sits on the floor, black clay, round belly, slender neck. To me, it‚Äôs a coffee pot. To her, it‚Äôs history. Ethiopia. Survival. Home. At least it used to be.

She takes me to church every Sunday. I protest, but I go. She asks what I do when I‚Äôm away. I ask her the same, but I already know. I know she stares at the wall and tries to remember.

Memories of war and peace. Meetings with kings, queens, and presidents. Does she remember being the Vice Minister of Education of Ethiopia? Holding the highest position a woman had held at the time? When she speaks, her voice sharpens, like the edges of stories not yet fully told. Stories of power.

She teaches me the power of holding on‚Äîpreserving memory, culture, even grief. That‚Äôs what she says. Now, I see her sitting in that apartment, staring at the chipped paint, her hands still, the stories pressing against the quiet. And so I see that power is what we preserve.

I‚Äôm still learning how to hold it all. How to carry my name, the weight of it, the power it holds in both its history and its simplicity. How to make sense of faith and doubt, of belonging and uncertainty. Maybe living fully means holding both the stories we inherit and the ones we‚Äôre still learning how to write. It‚Äôs a delicate balance‚Äîto embrace what has come before us while carving our own path forward. Maybe to live fully is to carry a life so vast it lingers, even when the body begins to forget.",1,1737519038.0,u_Desperate_Pack_9037,0,1.0,False

1i72lxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TraditionalMuslims/comments/1i72lxy/a_post_for_passport_bros_and_my_travel_experiences/,A Post For Passport Bros And My Travel Experiences,"Obviously this account is new, but the legends of this sub will know who this is! 


I will get started by, when alot of men mention that on this sub, ""Just be a passport bro! Go to this xyz country, and hip hip hooray everything will be fine!""

Alot of men who advise this, I can bet you have just heard about the ""passport bros"" and have not experienced anything themselves. They're speaking without any substance.

I've been gone for the past 2ish months, not coming back to NA until Ramadan time. I've solo traveled by myself to about 33 countries now in my life, in 5 continent's. I've covered almost all of ME/North Africa, some countries in western Europe, majority of Eastern Europe, and all of SEA. Haven't been to the stans or didn't do a full in-depth tour of south America yet, except Brazil to see the christ redeemer but had gotten robbed on gun point and lost literally everything. (A whole story on its own.)

So, I would say, I'm qualified enough because I've seen quite a bit to write what I'm writing now on the topic of what we as Muslim men care about. (Getting a good, righteous woman who won't be that materialistic, won't nag, and will obey.)

To get started, when anyone mentions or wants to travel, their ""idea"" of being on vacation is sitting on some random beach, glazing at the sun with their shades all day and then go to sleep at the hotel. Or, they visit the same tourist spots where all the tourists go, and don't experience any local culture. They will stay their whole vacation in the radius of where the popular attractions are, and won't leave. 

My idea of a ""vacation"" has always been going into the interiors, actually exploring the villages, and getting a good outlook of the country from this pov. I've gotten robbed on gun point by 2 men in Brazil, and had lost everything except my secret credit card and passport which I always keep somewhere very hidden. I've had a knife pulled up on me in Marrakesh, and I had got put into a ""trance"" or hypnosis in Indonesia LMAO ü§£ and $900 USD cash was taken from my bag. I never believed in that hypnosis bs until it actually happened to me.

And to preface, I might say some things here and say my experiences which people will be like ""haram"", I'm just sharing what I saw, and I'm not perfect like anyone. 

I had the guts to come to Ukraine recently and ""check it out"" for the hell of it as I like some thrill and adventure. And I don't post anything about my travels on social media. But I want to write it here for the Muslim men who have this idea of being a ""passport bro.""

To get started, let me simplify one thing for all the Muslim men here, who believe that there are still so many good women in these countries, etc. 

Let me tell you, the passport bro game could have worked very well in the 80's, 90's, and early 2000s. Basically like our father's, majority of them came to North America/Europe worked hard and then married our mothers from back home and this dynamic worked perfectly. There was no social media back then, women's empowerment bs wasn't a big thing, and men and women knew their roles. Obviously social media has changed this whole thing.

The biggest reality check I had received was, (men here have this idea that village girls in these countries aren't exposed to social media) I was in Tunisia, and Tunis it's very boring after a day or two. It's like any other City. So, I met this American guy and he told me that he was going to a festival down south about eight hours from Tunis, so I decided to come down with him. This festival is the most Arab thing you can see. (Camels fighting etc) So, we rent a car, and head south and on the way, we stop in some random village to get some food. This village may not have more then 2000 people, and as I'm looking for food, I see a woman waiting at the bus stop as she's laughing on her phone. I walk by her to take a glance at what's she's looking at, and guess what? It's tik Tok. From what I remember, it was some random female influencer.

And this is some random village in Tunisia, yes. Way outside from the nearest city, and women even here have been exposed to social media. It's literally everywhere now, it's a global phenomenon unless you're in some random jungle in Cambodia or war zone like yemen.

Morocco is a disaster. I've toured almost every major city and some small towns in Morocco, and yes, women are very beautiful and feminine but you are nothing but a $$ to them. Crazy thing I saw was, so, as I mentioned earlier no one is perfect, my bad habit is, I love shisha. Alhamdulliah I've never touched alcohol or drugs in my life, but shisha and or occasional cigar is my thing. 

Anyway, so I'm at this decently upscale shisha place enjoying that and a nice coffee, and I hear the conversation next to me of a white British man and a Moroccan woman. The guy is trying so hard to impress her, and I'm just observing. It was one sided the whole time, and I could just tell she was going to use him. So, I hear that she tells him (I'm going to the restroom and I see that she's taking her jacket with her) and she disappears lol. When the bill came, the bill was like 350 euros, and the guy said she ordered the most expensive things on the menu and cocktails. 

And this guy doesn't look like a random, I ask him he tells me he has some good post in the UK, (alot of women think passport bros are broke) and his face was so depressed. I explained to him that, this is the modern reality of the world today, and I hope he took the message. But sure as hell, as he was walking away from this place, I saw a broken and very miserable man who just got used for a meal which was 350 euros. Lol.

Tunisia, is very much similar like Morocco but not on a massive scale. Too many tourists come to Morocco, but not to Tunisia, so Tunisian women aren't as corrupted yet, but I was astonished at how Tunisian women dressed. Yoga pants and tights are common throughout the country (obviously not as much in the smaller cities) but every single woman has a phone and social media. Every single one of them.


Asking the locals, about Tunisian women they basically just said (I don't speak french or Arabic very little Arabic) and very few people speak English there so it was hard to communicate but we found ways. So the guys just told me, and pointed at the wallet that they will drain you. 

Out of all the Muslim countries I've ever went to, Malaysia, Pakistan and Algeria tops the list of seeing decent women. I spent some time in Algeria, and the hardest thing was getting the visa. You physically have to send your passport to their embassy and the whole process takes like a month and $250 later you get it all back.

So, Algeria doesn't have many tourists and because I don't speak french or Arabic, it was very hard to navigate. But I would say out of all the countries I've ever been to, Algerian people where the most friendliest from what I've seen. I'm not kidding as I was walking through these streets of Algiers or my favorite Jijal (beautiful sights there), people there will invite you to their house and as I never spoke their language that was not a problem, and if you try to give them something they will not take it. Every person who helped me in some sort of way in Algeria, every time I tried to give to them some money they pointed up as in they're doing for Allah SWT.

That felt very nice. Alot of Algerians were fascinated by the fact I don't speak Arabic, but I'm a Hafiz, so when the Quran was being played anywhere (very common in Muslim countries) I recite the next ayah from memory and that is the best conversation starter in these countries. And they can never believe that I don't speak Arabic. It's hard for them to fathom. 

Because I couldn't meet any English speaking tourists in Algeria, it felt very lonely and oftentimes while people are very nice, I was having lunch by myself in these places and I couldn't speak to anybody or have a proper conversation because of this. Usually with the way I am, everywhere I go I find English speaking tourists and then we make a group and go to places. 

When you're alone in a country and you don't know anyone, and you neither speak the language, that is the most reflective time. I was having the most deepest thought's in this stage.

But Algeria was very hard in this regard, which I would say it's a good thing because when too many kafir tourists come, it can corrupt the country and from what I've seen, Algeria is still very conservative in a good way. But good luck marrying an Algerian. From what I've heard from the locals and observed, Algerians only marry in their culture. They don't give out their women to other cultures unlike Moroccan and Tunisian.

And I had been to Egypt 3 years ago did a full tour, and Egypt is an interesting place. I would never go back, too many scammers, everyone only wants money, and good luck with Egyptian women LMAO. I would say good luck with Arab women in general. Arab women are very masculinized, and it has come to a point where even their own men don't want them. Arab men are now marrying Indonesian, Malaysian, Pakistani women. Lol. When I was in Malaysia few years back, I was surprised to see the amount of Malaysian women married to Arab men.


Coming back to Europe, Western Europe is like way more liberal then America. While you won't find as many blue/purple haired clowns, they're liberal in very different ways. Very progressive ideas, and majority of their men have no say at all. To give a good example, Europe is not like America. In America, it's almost like the size of Europe and each state you go it's literally the same because it's the same country. But in Europe, in matter of hours you can be in a completely different country and have different language and culture. European women travel the most from what I've seen, and I've had a lot of conversations and these girls are literally flying from UK or from France to like Spain. And then spend a weekend there and then somewhere else. Etc. And then back to work, because it's so easy to do with 20 euro Ryan air flights.

And as you can imagine, it shouldn't surprise you of these girls body counts. Europe is far more liberal then America. And even the men, atleast from what I've seen, American men have some sort of honor still. In the UK, France, Germany (which I found to be the most weirdest and cringe) men have no Honor and they will let their women do anything. Anything goes in these countries with the exception of Italy. From my experience and what I saw in Italy, Italy still has some family values but people are rude as hell.

But in France and Germany LMAO. Every other person is an atheist, and despises God or any form of religion.


And coming now to eastern Europe, I've been to almost every country in eastern Europe except Poland, Belarus, Armenia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Estonia.

To give a preface, Eastern Europe has been a long time destination for Western passport Bros. These Bros think that obviously their women are more beautiful and feminine, but they believe that flashing their dollars may give them ""love"" and they will find the ""one.""

I've talked to so many men and have seen so much in the past month in Eastern Europe and let me tell you something. I would say Eastern Europe is the worst place to get married. Firstly, check the divorce statistics of the world and out of the top 10 countries about 5 of them are from Eastern Europe. Yes.

You know, we men, we are easily led astray by the beauty of women. This will lead to many problems in a man's life from his money, health and literally everything. From what I've seen and heard, every eastern European man I've talked to had nothing good to say about eastern European women with the exception of Polish women in the smaller towns. 

Other then that, they said the same thing which is ""pay for play."" Meaning they're all gold diggers, and once your wallet is drained they will move on to the next one. One guy even showed me studies of where eastern European women rank very high on the dark triad test. What he was trying to tell me was, they will use their feminine beauty and charm to manipulate and obviously get what they want. And Western men, because back in the west, the women are so masculinized, when they see a feminine woman they will think with what's downstairs. And the same feminine beautiful woman will rinse the guy clean.

Yup. From what I've heard, nobody ever had anything good to say about Russian women, followed by Ukrainians, followed by Romanians. Some said good stuff about Serbian women, but in the smaller cities obviously. And Eastern European men have no respect for their women because they have seen what they do. You'd be surprised how many of these women are on only fans or are prostitutes. 

I didn't see many Muslims there, I saw some in Sofia, Odessa, some in Belgrade, but in these countries very hard to find halal food. And I was often just eating fish o filet from McDonald's. Obviously the best thing I like about Muslim countries is, you can eat anything. 

But yeah, good luck to the western passport bros who come to Eastern Europe hoping for getting into a relationship with these women. Unfortunately their destiny will be to get rinsed clean, and yeah.


I had shared this on a post awhile back, my summer job is doing tours in various cities in North America. And I remember clearly, I was doing a tour in the northeast and the whole bus was full of Ukrainians. So lot of these Ukrainian women were with their American boyfriends, so I was curious to see and because I get their full name in the list. I search some of these women on Facebook and these women had family pictures of their kids and husband from back in Ukraine, and now, while their husband is dying back home in the war, the same woman now is with an American man enjoying vacation. So if that's not brutal for you, I don't know what it will be. Imagine being that man.

Other interesting situation I had in Ukraine was, I was sitting in a coffee shop which was opposite to a famous club there. And I was observing the people, and later on a girl who's no more then 16 comes to me drunk out of her mind asking me to buy her drinks. (Obviously she wanted to use me, and in her mind was like let me use this sucker!) But yeah, in these countries women start going to clubs from early teens, and some random western passport bro will end up marrying this woman. If you ever taught eastern Europe was conservative, let me assure you, America is more conservative lol. The only great thing about eastern Europe which I liked was LGBTQ bs is looked down upon like next level.

I was in Belgrade doing a tour, and I was only eating fish o filet because it doesn't have much halal food. Serbs love to eat meat, so the tour guide was like, ""Aren't you a man! How come you don't eat meat?"" Blah blah, so I had to explain to him. But yeah.

Other thing I deeply pondered about was, obviously we as Muslim men in the west have a massive problem in finding good wives. But let me tell you something, obviously on a man's list getting married, and wanting female companionship is big on the list, but atleast in other aspects when it comes to opportunities and quality of life we have it decent.

But you know what? Imagine being a guy born in some random village in Morocco/Tunisia etc. And you can't leave, so you work at the local supermarket or whatever, and you see these random white men tourists coming in and smashing your women. Yes, this is what's happening, these countries have become a big hub for white Brits, Scottish, Irish, and men from the Scandinavian countries. And these men come on their 40 euro Ryan air flights, get dates and because these women want white men, these men are smashing everything. They go for the weekend and then come back to work on Monday.

WAllahi, I'm not joking to how many men I've talked to who smashed Muslim women in these countries. These men have told me that, ""We're still colonizing them, by smashing their women and the women can't get enough of us!"" Basically it's that theory again of ""just be white"". Scandinavian guys because genetically they're taller etc they're smashing the Muslim women in these countries. It's not other ethnicities from what I've seen. Also alot of french dudes from what I've seen. Because French go to Morocco, Tunisia etc as in, these countries french is spoken etc. Basically if you're a white guy who's decent looking from any of these countries, and you go to North Africa, you will lay all the pipe in the world. And these Muslim women will give themselves to these men.

So, imagine what goes into the mind of those men who are born and raised in those countries. They don't have as good quality of life, and cherry on top, they keep seeing their women being smashed by random white foreigner dudes. 

Yup, very very brutal for them. This is why, rather then giving your money to random women, tip these hard working guys who deserve it in these countries. Bless them, that's what I like to do, because when I genuinely taught about it, their lives are even more brutal then ours.

I would say, for the ""passport bro game"" we are too late, and majority of women have been influenced and brainwashed even in these countries. 

The only country other than Pakistan/Algeria where I saw the woman were somewhat decent was Malaysia. If you're Desi, go to your own country Pakistan/India/Bangladesh and try there. Maybe you'll find some luck, but remember, you'll only be seen as a passport to a better life, and a $$. The aspect of ""love"" will never be there lmao, so good luck with that.


But other then that, good luck. Social media has plagued majority of women, and times have changed. Even in these countries, women don't need men at all. They're studying, doing their own thing etc. They will probably be single and smash the highest quality guys on the side and will be no different then western women. 

We live in a world now, where if you as a man are not in the top 5-10% range, it's over for you. It's over for 90% of men out there. 

I don't believe majority of men will get married at all. And regarding women, they will all share the same 5 guys (players). And ironically, still complain about them.

But rest of the men will get nothing out here, and if you go to these countries thinking your passport or $ will help, you'll be seen nothing but as a dollar sign. That's all. 


While it's natural desire for a man to want s*x, female companionship, and to marry, but I don't believe that will happen for majority of men. Even if your tried your best, the world we live in today (because of the outrageous standards of women which they have been brainwashed by, the entitled nature, the divorce laws, the overall structure of society) it's over.

Yes, you heard it right. 

Regarding this sub, if it's still up 5 years from now the men here will be like ""use this tactic!"" ""Just have game bro, or be dominant bro!"" ""Just lift bro"" ""just make more money bro"" but I can bet you nothing will happen to even them.

But nobody is willing to accept the reality. While I don't know about y'all plans, I believe as a Muslim man, once you explore the world, see the hard reality, I think staying single and just giving up is the answer. While my answer may sound very defeatist, I can bet you even if you somehow got married you will not be happy and you will be miserable Lol. But good luck getting married first.

You most likely will sell yourself in the bio data's as the ""perfect man"" who makes good money, blah blah blah, and deep down wants to be loved for who you are, but that will never happen Lol..

This is just the harsh reality of life and for majority of men.



As for me, I understood this quite a long time ago, and I believe staying single is the answer. I don't think I'll find someone ""truly"" and my last potential was the closest one but couldn't work it out because of her dad.

The plan now is, work hard, travel, and focus on the Deen, cause we as Muslims have to understand that our ultimate purpose at the end of the day is for the hereafter. None of this will matter in the end anyway, and we come here alone and die alone. The only thing which we take with us is our deeds, and if that's in place we will get everything which we long for in the hereafter.",1,1737518876.0,TraditionalMuslims,0,1.0,False

Going to visit her soon in another state","I apologize that this is long but the situation is a bit complex. If you have the time, and especially are a woman, please consider reading as I am going back and forth on this in my head over and over.

I (25M) met a girl (also 25) through some mutual gaming friends about 2.5 months ago. When I tell you I thought she was the one within a few weeks of meeting her, I really, really, mean it. Everything about her is absolutely perfect to me and she has made me feel so many emotions I didn't know I had before I even knew what she looked like. And now that I do I think she is absolutely beautiful. But that is besides the point.

Pretty quickly after meeting we realized we had a common competitive multiplayer game we played and started playing just us together a fair bit. This led to random voice calls much more frequently just talking about our lives. It seemed like we had just about everything in common that two people could. I could tell we both enjoyed just talking because we agreed on so many things. Of course we still gamed, but after a few days/weeks the rest of the group joined us in the game and it because a little less 1 on 1. Around this time we started watching a show together on discord which was about 50 episodes. It seemed like things were going great and I could tell she was something very very special. One day we were on the phone for a total of 10 hours, a lot of that just randomly talking as we were doing things and the other half watching a show together. I felt like nobody would ever put 10 hours into someone else if they weren't at least a little interested. Sometimes we would call while she was cooking dinner or driving to the store or whatever. It didn't matter to me and I loved every second of it.

I live in a very beautiful area and had said I wanted to bring her out here at some point. This was only about a month after we had started talking and she genuinely sounded interested and when I asked if she really wanted to come at some point (partially to ski) she actually said yes and had sort of started looking at plane tickets to come during this last weekend. However, a day or two later, she basically said that she wasn't super sure about it anymore after talking to one of her friends who thought it was weird she was about to fly a few states to go visit a man she had never met and when she thought about it, she agreed. She texted me that she wanted to do something with some other members of our gaming friends as a group event first before she wanted to fly out solo. I completely understood. Luckily, the group soon after planned to all attend an event in March similar to one we had all met up at a few months ago before the girl in question had joined the gaming group. We are sharing a hotel room with one other male and one other female friend. That is still in the future plans.

I think that conversation made her think a lot more about how this whole thing was going down, because soon after, about 3 weeks ago, I noticed she suddenly started putting forth a lot less energy that before. She was very unresponsive to texts and instead of watching stuff for 3-4 hours it started being like a hour tops and then she would just leave to go game with the rest of the group. After about a week of this, I ended up just calling her and asking her what had changed. We had quite the heart to heart for about 15 minutes and it ended with her basically saying she had just suddenly met this boy (me) and it had all grown so quickly that it felt a little unsustainable from the normal social battery she had. She thought that she had sort of unconsciously started to communicate less after she realized that ""she really enjoyed it but was scared of us going past the friend level."" She had broken up with her boyfriend of 2 years a few months ago and for the first time in her recent life she wanted to not date anyone for a little bit to ""enjoy her peace of being independent"" for a little while. This pretty much told me that she had probably liked me in the past but now my chances with her were basically gone even though we were still gaming together a lot.

Suddenly, a few days later, she seemed to have flipped a bit. I realized that I was the one driving most of our sessions, usually texting her in the morning or inviting her to play/watch something. When I realized this, I sort of wanted to see what would happen if I stopped doing that most of the time. To my surprise, she actually did start asking me if we wanted to game if I hadn't texted her by the afternoon. We still gamed 1 on 1 a lot with coop games like It Takes Two for those who know what that is, and continued to watch some movies together. It seemed like things were back on the uphill.

She still plays a fair bit of games solo with me, but she also seems totally willing to go play with our gaming group if they are online even if we are in the middle of a game sometimes. I know this is obviously not a wrong thing to do, but it signals to me that she doesn't care as much about us having solo time as I do. I totally drop whatever I am doing if she wants to call or game, and while there is definitely something there, she does still want to game with the rest of the group a lot more than I do. It has almost started to make me sad whenever I see my gaming friends get online because I know that means there is a chance (not always) that she will be leaving soon. We usually join the other group together and continue to play, but its no longer a one on one thing. A lot of times she doesn't invite me when everyone is online and I end up joining on my own when I notice everyone is playing a bit later. Sometimes she really wants to call and talk and sometimes she says she would rather just lie in bed and doomscroll and then go to bed without saying anything. I have asked her why she takes so long to look at her texts sometimes (she has read receipts on) and she says she just inst controlled by her phone and that she actually completely turned instagram notifications off entirely so she wouldn't look at as often. I wouldn't say I am controlled by my phone either and sometimes wait to respond to my friends for a little bit, but I never wait to respond to her and catch myself checking my phone waiting for a text from her while it seems she doesn't do the same. Again, I understand that none of these examples are objectively wrong, but they all add to the evidence in my head that she isn't really into me.

Now here is the interesting part. I mentioned to her in a call a month ago that there were these events (I wont go into what they are) that are randomly hosted in different cities around the country and that I had always wanted to go to one. Over this last weekend I had looked up on the website when and where the next ones were, and through some coincidence there happens to be one in her city in a few days (we live in different states). I mentioned this to her the next day while we were gaming and that I thought it was funny and really thought about going. To my surprise, she said I totally should and offered to let me stay at her house with her roommates. Through yet another massive surprise, she said she wanted to go to the event with me (this is not something most people would have any interest in and I'm not sure if she does). I am still unsure how much of it is her actually wanting to go to this vs just wanting to go with me, but either way I spent about $100 on her ticket. She is a student and doesn't have very much money at all, so I already told her I am not letting her pay me back since she is giving me a place to stay.

Ill be honest, I probably would not fly to another state to go to one of these events, but as soon as she said she would join me I was all in. I have all of tickets already and we talked about it and it has turned into a full weekend trip. We have a few plans of stuff to go do and she is going to take me around places in her city. She came up with a few things she wanted to take me to including some local coffee shops and breweries and we are planning on going to the gym together one morning. I really tried to make it clear to her that she didn't have to do any of this and that I didn't want to steal her entire weekend if she didn't want to and while she didn't sound like she completely disagreed with the statement, she said she didn't mind and that we would see a lot of stuff.

It seems like me flying out to meet her was such a sporadic thing that I don't even know what to think anymore. Less than a month ago she seemed to make it quite clear to me that she was no longer really interested anything further than what we were, but then suddenly she got much more exciting and it seems like she started putting in a lot more energy out of nowhere and now I am flying out to meet her at the end of the week and attending a semi-formal event together one night and then exploring her city for the next two. It feels like my chances with her or her interest in me in more than friend have flipped so many times in the last month.

She still sounds genuinely interested in coming out to visit me at some point but its all under the guise that she is mostly coming out to see my state and the area I live in. I don't know what is going on in her head I with that one. I know that it will not be until her semester is done so it will be a few months at minimum. I feel so good about her and would fly out to meet her or fly her out to meet me however many times would be needed if we were together.

I really think this weekend will be fun and no matter what I think I will enjoy it, but I also don't want to risk telling her how I feel upfront and risk ruining the group dynamic if I don't think it is mutual as it would probably make things way too awkward if so. I have practiced what I would tell her in my head at least 25 times now for whenever that moment comes, and I have already made up my mind that at some point (I was thinking after the event in March since it would be the last time we would for sure see each other in person) I will tell her even if its a ways away and I have lost any hope with her, if for nothing else than just so she knows how happy she has made me feel these last few months even if its more of a parting conversation as our relationship dies out.

So that brings me back to the title question. Does it sound like she is actually interested in me? It seems weird to me that a girl would be excited for me to fly out to her and wanting to attend this event with me and spend the weekend with me if she shes me as just a friend, especially considering how close we have grown so quickly. Additionally, what sorts of things should I be looking for this weekend to see if she is treating this purely as a friend thing or if she is waiting for me to finally stop being shy and make some sort of more direct conversation about moving forward?

1i72jl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1i72jl5/not_too_shabby/,Not too shabby...,"My eyes open at 7:00am. I'd love to go back to sleep, but I know we have to be ready by 9:00. Look over. My friend's not there. 'Probably went for smokes.' Drag myself out of this impossibly comfortable bed. Bathroom. 'Time to pack gear and make sure I have everything I'm gonna need in my pockets.' Gear packed. Double check what I've left out. Mental run through of what I'll need at the shelter. 'All good.' Friend gets back. ""You go to get smokes?"" ""Yeah. I got two for you and one for me. It was nineteen bucks."" ""Damn!"" I'm half asleep still. Math isn't really my strong suit at the moment. I haven't had any coffee yet. Force brain to do calculations. 'Yep. That sounds exactly right.'

Friend, ""What are we gonna do about all this food."" ""I might throw a few things in my pack, but honestly I'm prepared to take a loss. I'm not overjoyed about it, but its ok."" He's pretty adamant about taking it all with us. I can't argue with that logic. I've been hungry enough times that I hate to waste food. Plus dude and I dropped a hundred bucks yesterday between the two of us. It would definitely be a shame to let it go to waste. Friend, ""I'll bag it up. If nothing else we can give it to the ladies in the kitchen when we get there."" ""Brilliant plan. I'm gonna go burn one."" ""I'll come with you.""

Downstairs. Out back door of hotel. Smokes lit. A maroon truck pulls up. Dude gets out and comes over. No coat. He's definitely freezing his balls off, but he's taking it well. It's snowing and starting to stick. Him, ""You guys going to the shelter?"" ""Yeah."" ""I'm ready to take some people now."" ""We got four ready to go if you give us fifteen to grab our gear and make sure the room's in good shape."" Hands in his pockets braced against the cold, he smiles. ""I'll give you fourteen."" Me, now also smiling, ""Fair enough."" I love a guy with a sense of humor when things aren't ideal for him. 

Another guy out there smoking with us, ""I want a ride back downtown."" Freezing guy, ""Everything's closed. Nobody's going downtown."" Other guy, almost spitting mad now, ""I wanna go downtown!"" Me, ""We're going to a good place. I don't do shelters. I'm a hitchhiker. I've been there before. It's a good spot. Beats being out in this shit."" Other guy, slightly less pissed, ""I don't care. I'll find a spot."" Freezing guy, ""The roads are gonna be closed soon. That's why we're here early. None of the rides are going downtown. We've got to get everybody to the shelter while we can."" Other guy seems to accept this.

Friend and I suck down cigarettes at a break-neck pace while walking to the ashtray. Smokes out. Back upstairs. Room. Me, ""Fellas there's a ride ready to take us right now. It'd be good to get there early so we can take our pick of cots."" All four of us are about thirty seconds from ready to bail. My friend loads all the food into the bags I bought yesterday in two minutes flat. Gear on times four. Room checked - Good to go. Out the door.

Downstairs. 'We're gonna be the first ones there. Easy pick of cots. We'll avoid the cluster fuck of being checked in. Nice!' Into hallway. 

We work our way into a sea of people. Out the front. Gear into a covered trailer. Quickly get into a van. Several cars take off full of people. Other van takes off. We pull forward a little and stop. We just sit there for a while.  Me laughing in my head, 'I thought we were on the ball, up early, ahead of the game, and we're gonna be dead last. üòÜ' I don't really care. I have this unshakable faith that things will work out just fine.

Finally, the van pulls out of the parking lot. 'üé∂ On the road again... üé∂' 

'Hmmm... This is Alabama. It doesn't snow here. They don't have snow equipment. This guy driving has probably never driven on snow before. He's a bit hyper. He's driving like it's a warm dry summer day, passing other vehicles, on a couple inches of snow that's sticking...

I hope he doesn't kill us. 

I'm not gonna live what might be the last few minutes of my life in fear.' I'm calm. No worries brah!

We make it to the shelter. Pretty stoked.  Number 23. They ask us some basic questions while they check us each in. ""Are you looking to find some work and get a place to live?"" ""I've got some work waiting on me in Florida. I'm outta here as soon as it warms up."" She writes, 'Wanting to go to Florida' at the bottom of my check-in sheet.

They were giving out bus tickets last time I was here. I'm not counting on it... But why would she write it down? Maybe...

Get through check-in. Go find a cot where I want it. Unfold blanket so everyone knows it's taken. Over to counter. A lovely woman pours me a cup off coffee. Sugar. Cream. ""Than you very much! I appreciate it."" ""You're welcome!"" Big smile.

Back to cot. Dude next to me has got his things haphazardly spread on the floor. 'Not touching me or my stuff. No big deal.' He starts talking to himself. 'I can probably deal... The time to move is now before this place fills up.' I picked this cot because it looked brand new and it was out of the walkways, and away from the bathrooms. I want to keep it. ""Hey -friend-, you wanna give me a hand switching this cot and that one?"" ""Yeah no problem."" We execute cot switching maneuver in five seconds. I'm a little farther away from walkway and bathrooms. 'Perfect!'

Trailer with gear shows up. They load it all into a hallway. Call us five at a time to find gear, put it in bags, seal it up, and put our numbers on it. Gear goes into a room none of us can get into. Safe. Flawlessly executed.

This place is only a quarter full, maybe. One of our group wanted to go to a shelter he's been staying at but the roads got shut down immediately after we check in. Deemed impassable. We've been getting alerts all day. When he called they had open beds, so I'm pretty sure everybody is off the streets. I'm happy about that.

It's been a rough day of eating, sleeping, and smoking. üòÅ My friend and I are stoked to be here. The hotel was nicer, but these people are kind. Resources are top notch.

Oh, and the preacher I had the debate with last time about what kind of help homeless people need came over, shook my hand, and told me it was good to see me this morning.",2,1737518671.0,vagabond,1,1.0,False

Little did I know I was in for a big one this past week. Wife‚Äôs uncle is in the ICU so we were out flying cross country. Although it was mostly going to be a chill visit the uncle and see family for support type of trip I didn‚Äôt expect what was about to happen.. airports.. people slamming beers at 9 am? Of course in our society that‚Äôs normal right? I passed it was not happening. On the plane I used to get a drink after take off since I would get anxious and dizzy, but I knew of if I used this as an excuse it was the easy way out, again I passed as I watched a minority of others getting some hard liquor and coke. I ordered coffee and sparking water and put on a movie. 

Destination landing, I felt good‚Ä¶ but now the real fun started. After a long hospital visit my wife‚Äôs family had a get together at the house where people who haven‚Äôt seen one another in years were getting together and I s*** you not there was probably 6 24 packs of beer just for starters. Everyone was drinking, even people who normally never drink in the family were drinking. I smirked and thought to myself, well this is a real test isn‚Äôt it? Even if I throw January out the window my wife wouldn‚Äôt be upset this was a special occasion. I started with a water and some lemon, soon people are tossing back the beers, getting loud lively, jokes here and there, food, more drinks. 

Then the dreaded question from the son of the uncle who was in the hospital. Surely I couldn‚Äôt turn down a drink with him, that would be rude right? No it wouldn‚Äôt be. Rude would be not satisfying my own needs in healing and getting stronger in my resistance to the thing I don‚Äôt want or need. I explained, bro I‚Äôm doing dry January I‚Äôm here for you though, can I make a coffee? He had some amazing Peruvian blend coffee he was excited to share, of course I was the only one who was drinking it though. 

Wow what was this super power? Watching these people get drunk, what the heck is that smell? Oh it‚Äôs the smell of alcohol on everyone‚Äôs breath I‚Äôve never smelled to this extent because I was always one of them smelling just like that. Fun? I still danced, I was still a big part of that party as I‚Äôm a jokester and didn‚Äôt hold back regardless of alcohol. 

For the next 2 nights we went out to bars and watched the ufc fight at this place where no one wasn‚Äôt drinking, well there were 2 people my wife and I. All of a sudden I‚Äôm getting compliments, man you have some crazy willpower, wow I‚Äôm so proud of you etc. 

This trip was eye opening and I think it was meant to happen this way‚Ä¶ I am looking forward to this new adventure in life that excludes alcohol. ",2,1737518625.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False
1i72iwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1i72iwa/women_of_reddit_do_you_think_she_is_interested_in/,"Women of reddit, do you think she is interested in me? Going to visit her soon in another state","I apologize that this is long but the situation is a bit complex. If you have the time, and especially are a woman, please consider reading as I am going back and forth on this in my head over and over.

I (25M) met a girl (also 25) through some mutual gaming friends about 2.5 months ago. When I tell you I thought she was the one within a few weeks of meeting her, I really, really, mean it. Everything about her is absolutely perfect to me and she has made me feel so many emotions I didn't know I had before I even knew what she looked like. And now that I do I think she is absolutely beautiful. But that is besides the point.

Pretty quickly after meeting we realized we had a common competitive multiplayer game we played and started playing just us together a fair bit. This led to random voice calls much more frequently just talking about our lives. It seemed like we had just about everything in common that two people could. I could tell we both enjoyed just talking because we agreed on so many things. Of course we still gamed, but after a few days/weeks the rest of the group joined us in the game and it because a little less 1 on 1. Around this time we started watching a show together on discord which was about 50 episodes. It seemed like things were going great and I could tell she was something very very special. One day we were on the phone for a total of 10 hours, a lot of that just randomly talking as we were doing things and the other half watching a show together. I felt like nobody would ever put 10 hours into someone else if they weren't at least a little interested. Sometimes we would call while she was cooking dinner or driving to the store or whatever. It didn't matter to me and I loved every second of it.

I live in a very beautiful area and had said I wanted to bring her out here at some point. This was only about a month after we had started talking and she genuinely sounded interested and when I asked if she really wanted to come at some point (partially to ski) she actually said yes and had sort of started looking at plane tickets to come during this last weekend. However, a day or two later, she basically said that she wasn't super sure about it anymore after talking to one of her friends who thought it was weird she was about to fly a few states to go visit a man she had never met and when she thought about it, she agreed. She texted me that she wanted to do something with some other members of our gaming friends as a group event first before she wanted to fly out solo. I completely understood. Luckily, the group soon after planned to all attend an event in March similar to one we had all met up at a few months ago before the girl in question had joined the gaming group. We are sharing a hotel room with one other male and one other female friend. That is still in the future plans.

I think that conversation made her think a lot more about how this whole thing was going down, because soon after, about 3 weeks ago, I noticed she suddenly started putting forth a lot less energy that before. She was very unresponsive to texts and instead of watching stuff for 3-4 hours it started being like a hour tops and then she would just leave to go game with the rest of the group. After about a week of this, I ended up just calling her and asking her what had changed. We had quite the heart to heart for about 15 minutes and it ended with her basically saying she had just suddenly met this boy (me) and it had all grown so quickly that it felt a little unsustainable from the normal social battery she had. She thought that she had sort of unconsciously started to communicate less after she realized that ""she really enjoyed it but was scared of us going past the friend level.""

1i72is2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Klutzy_Sail5986/comments/1i72is2/the_role_of_antioxidants_in_preventing_cognitive/,The Role of Antioxidants in Preventing Cognitive Decline: What Does Science Say?,"Cognitive decline is a natural part of aging for many, but understanding the factors that contribute to this process can help mitigate its effects. One area of growing interest is the role antioxidants play in preserving brain health and preventing cognitive decline. Antioxidants, found in various foods and supplements, combat oxidative stress, a key contributor to aging and neurodegenerative diseases. But what does the science say about their efficacy?

[antioxidants and cognitive decline](https://preview.redd.it/8iph3xvrygee1.jpg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b2fca5bfdd34579298dfee767c1413c332cc97a)

# Understanding Oxidative Stress and Cognitive Decline

Oxidative stress occurs when there‚Äôs an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage cells, including neurons in the brain, through a process called oxidative damage. Over time, this damage accumulates, contributing to inflammation, impaired brain function, and conditions like Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

The brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress because of its high metabolic activity and lipid-rich environment. This makes antioxidants essential for neutralizing free radicals and protecting neurons. Studies have linked chronic oxidative stress to memory loss, [reduced mental acuity](https://nootropicsstories.com/memory-learning/from-forgetful-to-fearless-my-journey-to-a-sharper-mind/), and accelerated cognitive aging, highlighting the importance of maintaining a healthy balance.

# Key Antioxidants for Brain Health

While the body produces some antioxidants naturally, dietary and supplemental antioxidants play a critical role in boosting defenses. Several antioxidants have been studied for their potential to prevent or slow cognitive decline:

**Vitamin E**: Known for its ability to protect cell membranes, vitamin E has shown promise in reducing oxidative damage in the brain. Research suggests that higher vitamin E intake is associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and slower cognitive decline in older adults.

**Vitamin C**: A water-soluble antioxidant, vitamin C helps regenerate other antioxidants like vitamin E. Studies have shown that adequate vitamin C levels are linked to better cognitive performance and a reduced risk of neurodegenerative diseases.

**Polyphenols**: Found in foods like berries, tea, and dark chocolate, polyphenols have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Flavonoids, a type of polyphenol, have been linked to improved memory and learning abilities.

**Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)**: CoQ10 is essential for cellular energy production and has powerful antioxidant properties. Preliminary research indicates it may help reduce oxidative stress in the brain and improve cognitive function.

**Curcumin**: The active compound in turmeric, curcumin, has garnered attention for its neuroprotective effects. Studies have found that curcumin can cross the blood-brain barrier, reduce inflammation, and protect against oxidative damage, potentially delaying cognitive decline.

# Scientific Evidence Supporting Antioxidants and Cognitive Health

Scientific studies provide compelling evidence for the role of antioxidants in brain health. A longitudinal study published in the journal *Neurology* found that individuals with higher dietary intake of antioxidants like vitamins C and E had a lower risk of cognitive impairment. Similarly, research from *The Journal of Nutrition, Health & Aging* highlighted the benefits of polyphenol-rich diets, showing improved memory and executive function among older adults.

In animal studies, antioxidants like curcumin and CoQ10 have demonstrated the ability to reduce amyloid plaque buildup in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. While human trials are still ongoing, these findings underscore the potential of antioxidants as part of a preventative strategy against cognitive decline.

# Incorporating Antioxidants into Your Diet

A balanced diet rich in antioxidant-containing foods is a practical way to support brain health. Here are some tips for boosting your antioxidant intake:

**Eat the Rainbow**: Include a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables in your diet. Blueberries, spinach, kale, and tomatoes are excellent sources of antioxidants.

**Choose Healthy Fats**: Nuts and seeds, such as almonds and sunflower seeds, provide vitamin E and other brain-friendly nutrients.

**Drink Smart**: Green tea and coffee are rich in polyphenols that support cognitive function. Consider incorporating these beverages into your daily routine.

**Spice It Up**: Add turmeric to soups, stews, and teas to benefit from curcumin‚Äôs antioxidant properties.

**Consider Supplements**: If it‚Äôs challenging to get enough antioxidants through diet alone, supplements like vitamin C, vitamin E, or CoQ10 can help bridge the gap. Always consult a healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen.

# Limitations and Ongoing Research

While the evidence for antioxidants and brain health is promising, it‚Äôs important to recognize the limitations of current research. Much of the data comes from observational studies, which can show correlations but not causation. Additionally, the effectiveness of antioxidant supplementation varies depending on the individual and their specific health status.

Ongoing clinical trials aim to provide clearer answers about the long-term benefits of antioxidants in preventing cognitive decline. Researchers are also exploring how different antioxidants work synergistically, potentially amplifying their protective effects.

While they‚Äôre not a magic solution for preventing all forms of cognitive decline, incorporating antioxidant-rich foods and supplements into your lifestyle is a proactive step toward maintaining mental sharpness as you age. Combined with other healthy habits like regular exercise, quality sleep, and stress management, antioxidants can help you build a strong foundation for long-term brain health.

Understanding the science behind antioxidants and their impact on cognitive function empowers you to make informed choices about your diet and overall wellness. As research continues to uncover their potential, antioxidants remain a promising tool in the fight against cognitive decline.",1,1737518599.0,u_Klutzy_Sail5986,0,1.0,False

So my bf (straight man ) had been cheating on me with 3 of my best friend (cis gay man) . I am a black trans girl .
He one day left  his phone with me when he went to shower and since I can easily open it ,I just went through it and checked the messages and the  deleted ones of course (we know each other‚Äôs passcodes) . He changed their names but obviously I was able to figure it out and none of them seemed to know that he was playing with the 3 of them.

I honestly got a little choked and I kept that for like 3 weeks to kind of heal and have some moments for me and I have been doing  all my best to avoid my friends as well as not giving him (bf ) as much time as before and mostly I was doing my best to keep him away from me ‚Ä¶meaning I don‚Äôt respond to his texts like before or pick up his calls or call him and do all the little things I would usually do which he took in his twisted mind as me cheating on him ‚Ä¶.so I blocked his number and instagram / literally cut off all the communication . 

I met and talked with one of the 3 to let him know that I found out about him and the (bf) he was so anxious and sorry ..and I told him about the other 2 . It was a mess ‚Ä¶.ü•π 

It was pretty funny how they (3) all wanted to reach out literally the very next day of the little confession.

I guess they talked to him too because he literally parked at my building apt for 2 days straight and did  it pretty much every night after work for 2 weeks  , it was a bit creepy .

 I want to have a conversation with him but at this point I am wondering if it‚Äôs necessary ???we haven‚Äôt talked in 4 weeks as you can imagine. But he is still around most of my little favourite places like I met him at my coffee shop 5 days ago,  now I wonder he is not gonna pop up at the library I usually go to. Anyway just to tell you that man can be real assholes and dating in this generation (I am 23/ he is 26) is CRAZY .

Ever felt like you're diving into a never-ending ocean of AI jargon? Well, you're not alone! Today, we're untangling the mysteries of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science. These terms are often thrown around interchangeably, but they're as different as kale, spinach, and lettuce ü•¨üòÜ. Let's break it down in a simple, no-nonsense way!

### Machine Learning: The Practical Algorithm Wizardry üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Machine Learning (ML) is like the helpful assistant who learns how you like your coffee and prepares it just the way you want every morning. It's all about algorithms learning from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. Think spam filters, recommendation systems, and even self-driving cars! It's ""learning from examples,‚Äù flexibly adapting to the data it receives.

**Tip:** If you're just starting with ML, try building a simple project like a movie recommendation engine using Python. It‚Äôs a fun way to see ML‚Äôs magic in action!

### Deep Learning: The Neural Network Maestro üéµ
Deep Learning is a subset of ML focusing on neural networks with many layers. Imagine trying to teach your dog a series of tricks, progressively building on each new skill. That‚Äôs deep learning‚Äîuncovering patterns through immense data that one single layer couldn't capture. It's more complex and data-hungry but excels at processing vast amounts of data, like images and sound, just like how your favorite voice assistant understands you.

**Pro Tip:** Curious about how facial recognition works or how self-driving cars ‚Äúsee‚Äù the road? Dive into convolutional neural networks (CNNs)‚Äîthe magic wand behind these applications.

### Data Science: The Storyteller with Data üìà
Data Science is the overarching field that wraps up ML and deep learning with a shiny bow. It's like being the director of a movie where data is the main character. It involves collecting, cleaning, and interpreting data to uncover meaningful insights and decision-making nuggets using statistical models, ML methods, and data visualization techniques.

**Actionable Idea:** Start with a small project, like analyzing your favorite sports team‚Äôs performance using publicly available datasets. It‚Äôs a great way to build your portfolio and have some fun!

The price of common household goods, like coffee, may rise. 

A coffee shortage would be the first in our lifetime, but it is not the first time. During times of upheaval, coffee beans were often replaced with substitutes.

A number of roots and grains have been used to create rich, warm drinks. These roasts mimic the flavor, but are uncaffeined. (The only caffeine-containing plant in North America grows around the Gulf of Mexico.)

1i7270c,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1i7270c/the_rabbit_box/,The Rabbit Box,"When I was six years old, my mother sent me to stay with my grandparents for the summer. 

At this time in my life, I had never met my mother's parents, and I had never been away from home longer than a weekend. When my mom broke the news to me that I would be going away for nearly two months, I sobbed on and off for several days. It wasn't until she told me that my grandparents had a dog that I began to feel some excitement about leaving home. 

Kindergarten was ending, and on the last day, I joined the class on the rainbow-colored carpet where we were prompted by our teacher, Ms. Hayne, to share something we had planned for summer break. Ms. Hayne was a young teacher, in her second or third year at the school whose voice was sweet and soft. When it was my turn to share, I proudly exclaimed that I would be spending the summer at my grandparents‚Äôs house. I made sure to mention the dog. My peers giggled and shouted at the mention of the animal, and that helped me to adjust to the idea of leaving even more. 

It felt like some sort of adventure. Still, the day came, and I trembled with nerves in the back seat of my mom‚Äôs Honda as she drove me several hours away from home and toward the unknown. The road seemed to be unending, and the wide city street eventually narrowed into a poorly maintained stretch of asphalt that dug deep into a wooded mountain. 

‚ÄúWhere are the other cars?‚Äù I asked my mother as I peered around checking each window. ‚ÄúNot many people come up this way. Grandma and Grandpa like their privacy, so they moved up here back before you were born.‚Äù Sensing my uneasiness she added, ‚ÄúDont worry honey. You are going to have so much space to run around and explore. It's going to be a good change of pace for you.‚Äù I shuffled in my seat and fell quiet. I did like the idea of exploring outside. My mom and I lived on the second floor of an old apartment building. There were some neighbor kids with whom I spent most of my free time, but finding something to do other than coloring or building Legos was difficult since none of us were allowed to play outside. Too many strangers and moving cars. 

It wasn't the worst neighborhood, but it wasn't the kind of place where you let your kids roam free. There was always an adult watching us when we would venture out to play on the basketball court, where we would usually just end up playing freeze tag. That ten-by-twenty cement pad contained the majority of my outdoor experience. It would be nice to have some freedom to run wild, catch bugs, and climb trees. 

The road trailed on and the foliage seemed to grow all-encompassing, almost swallowing the small road in some areas. As branches stretched over the skies the shadows paved the street in shapes all too frightening for a child with an active imagination. I chose to keep my view centered on the seat in front of me. We drove all day, and when the sun had set we finally pulled onto a dirt road. We continued for at least another mile before a large house came into view behind the trees. 

As we slowly inched the car closer the fauna opened up into a clearing, and the whole property was visible. Near the main house was a barn that looked as though it used to be painted red, but was now chipped away revealing mostly brown and white wood. As we rounded the house to the back where my mom parked the car a small shed appeared. 

‚ÄúAlright. We‚Äôre here!‚Äù my mom shouted with more relief than enthusiasm. I kept my seat belt on, hoping that if I waited long enough my mother would decide this whole thing had been a mistake and turn the car around. Instead, she removed her keys, killing the radio that was softly humming static, and opened her door. I followed my mom's lead, not wanting to remain alone in the car. Stepping out of the vehicle I was hit with a light gust of wind that chilled my small bones and made me grimace. I looked at my mom, and she could see how tense I was. 

Grabbing my hand she led me around to the side door and knocked. I clutched her hand in mine as we waited for the door to swing open. After a moment, creaking footsteps approached, and the hinges of the door squeaked to reveal a tender aged face. My grandmother stood in the doorway with a soft smile and warm eyes ushering us in with her free hand, the other clutching a plate of cookies. ‚ÄúCome in!‚Äù she squealed. 

I looked at my mother who wore the same soft smile on her own face. We walked in and the door was shut behind us. The warmth my grandmother exuded did a decent job of melting my fears, but the atmosphere of the home was quick to send the chills back down my spine. All of the lights were off. Only the moonlight shining in through the entryway window illuminated my surroundings. ‚ÄúOh excuse me one moment.‚Äù my grandmother said as she placed the tray of cookies on the coffee table and rushed to turn on a lamp. 

When the small, solitary light source was flipped on the house was left looking eerie. My mom began catching up with my grandma. The two had talked over the phone several times over the years, but this was the first time they had been in the same room since I was born. They sat on the couch as my mom complained about the drive and my grandmother tried to force-feed her oatmeal raisin cookies. Noticing my shyness my mom excused me to explore the house. ‚ÄúYour room is upstairs to the right,‚Äù Grandma said. I picked up my bag, slung it over my shoulders, and headed towards the staircase. As I ascended I made sure to count each stair, a habit that I have yet to break even in my adulthood. I reached the top. 

14 steps. 

I glanced to my right, seeing that the hallway led to a small bedroom and a bathroom adjacent to it. I peered to the left out of curiosity and let out an involuntary scream. Down the left hallway was my grandfather, a man wholly unfamiliar to me, standing in the doorway. His silhouette was outlined by the shining light behind him, creating a specter in my young imagination. 

My mother rushed up the stairs when she heard me and frantically asked what was wrong. Frozen in fear, I stammered for the words. ‚ÄúTh..the‚Ä¶man‚Ä¶‚Äù I pointed down the hall. Grandpa had turned his back and began walking into the master bedroom, shutting the door behind him without a word. ‚ÄúOh don't you mind him,‚Äù Grandma said as she reached the 14th step. ‚ÄúHe's been feeling under the weather. He hopes to make an appearance tomorrow after he's gotten some rest.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I plan on leaving kind of early tomorrow. I have to get back for some meetings at work.‚Äù Mom said. ‚ÄúTrust me,‚Äù Grandma replied, ‚ÄúNo one gets up earlier than Grandpa.‚Äù

The next morning I got up early to say goodbye to my mom. Up until this point I had been the only one with visible hesitation, but she seemed to linger longer than expected, looking into my eyes and showering me with kisses and I-love-yous. I wish I could have stayed in that moment forever. True to my grandmother‚Äôs words, my grandfather had gotten up before anyone but chose to spend the morning hunting. This was irritating to my mother, but she really did have responsibilities at work to return to, so she eventually got into the driver‚Äôs seat of her car and rounded the house heading for the main road. 

I waved goodbye and watched her car until it dipped past the clearing and was absorbed by the tree line. With the vehicle out of sight, my fate was sealed. I would be spending almost two full months in this foreign place. ‚ÄúCome on inside. We can have some breakfast together.‚Äù said my grandmother. 

The rest of the morning was fairly normal. I ate eggs and bacon, colored a picture, and even got to spend some time watching cartoons on the old TV in the living room. It was the kind that had the antennas at the top, and I didn't get any of the normal channels but I eventually found an animated show and sat back to enjoy the story. That morning I had also gotten to know grandma‚Äôs dog Buffalo, who had gotten used to my presence and was lying next to me on the couch. 

Everything changed when my grandfather returned home from hunting. Though I was in the living room, I immediately tuned in to his arrival as he threw the front door open and yelled out to my grandma. I stayed seated on the couch, but I could hear her greeting him at the door. Her demeanor was drastically different from then on. Instead of the bubbly, cheerful woman I had met the night before, she became a fearful shell when he was around. 

Grandpa mumbled something about having lunch ready by the time he returned from the basement. Dragging two lifeless rabbits at his side, my grandfather walked to the basement door and stopped. He turned to me and said, ‚ÄúDont you go snooping around my basement, you hear me, kid?‚Äù I nodded, and he descended the stairs closing the door behind him. ‚ÄúWhat's in the basement?‚Äù I asked turning to Grandma. ‚ÄúThat's where your grandpa does his work. He sells the rabbit meat and skins, and he uses the downstairs area to clean and prepare them.‚Äù 

I didn't like the idea of dead rabbits in the house. In my innocent mind, I could only feel sadness for the creatures, and even a little fear. I had never seen a dead thing before. A curiosity about the rabbits started to grow within me. Not the blood and guts part. I wasn't old enough to understand that. But the idea of something being alive and then just‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶not being alive anymore was sort of fascinating in a morbid way. I knew then that I had to get a closer look at the rabbits. I wish that I hadn't. Maybe if I had followed the rules and stayed out of that basement, none of this would have happened to me.

A few days passed, and the routine became clear. Every morning, Grandpa would go rabbit hunting. And every day a little after breakfast he would return home with 2 to 5 rabbits strung up by their legs. I remember that, even as a child, it was odd to me that I never saw any meat or skins returning with Grandfather when he would come back upstairs. Wasn't he selling them? They surely can't just still be sitting in the basement‚Ä¶could they? It was hard to come to any conclusions, especially because Grandpa hardly ever talked to me or even acknowledged my existence. 

Grandmother was silent. I quickly became aware that the happy talkative personality I had seen when we first arrived had been a facade, hiding the real grandma. In reality, she was timid, quiet, and kept to herself most days. She only really spoke to me about when a meal was prepared, or when it was time to go to sleep. Other than those times, she stayed in her room. I was too young to realize that I was being neglected, but I understood that something about this situation was wrong. 

Left to fend for myself most of the day, I spent my time exploring the woods with Buffalo. He was a good dog and stayed close to me even without a leash. Though he was a coward most of the time, he seemed to be very protective of me and would often jump in front of me to warn me of ledges, streams, or animal dens. I grew to love that dog. One day while I was at the edge of the tree line about to go exploring I noticed my grandfather getting into his truck and driving off the property. I was about to continue on my expedition when a thought crossed my mind. 

This is the perfect time to see the rabbits in the basement. 

With my grandpa out of the house, I figured I could sneak downstairs, take a quick peek, and be back upstairs before anyone noticed. Grandmother would be in her room until dinner time, and even without knowing where Grandfather went, I estimated I had at least a few minutes. Maybe more. I turned back and headed inside. Once inside I did a brief check to make sure my grandmother wasn't wandering about. Just as I thought she would be, she was shut up in her bedroom. 

It was almost too perfect. I stepped over to the basement door, making sure to tiptoe in case my footsteps alerted her. When I reached the door I was surprised to find it unlocked. They were making this too easy. I opened the door slowly, attempting to minimize the creaking that all the house doors emitted. Looking down the steps, I took in the darkness. ‚ÄúStay here boy,‚Äù I said to Buffalo. If there was raw rabbit meat down there, I didn't want him getting into it and blowing my cover. 

I began my slow descent, counting the stairs. Reaching the bottom, I muttered, 

‚Äú12‚Äù, 

under my breath. I looked around for a light switch and had to feel the walls with my hands until I found what I was looking for and flicked it up. The small bulb illuminated the room in a dim yellow shade. I was starting to feel a little creeped out, and for a second thought to turn back, until I noticed a door on the other side of the room. I figured that must be where Grandpa kept the rabbit remains. 

Inching forward I reached out for the handle, but before I could turn the knob I was caught off guard by a loud booming voice. ‚ÄúSo!‚Äù my Grandfather shouted from behind me. ‚ÄúYou want to see what I keep in the old storage closet do ya kid?‚Äù I quickly turned to face him, my blood running cold. He had a smile on his face, but he didn't seem to be happy at all. There was malice in his eyes. 

‚ÄúI'm sorry Grandpa I'll go back upstairs,‚Äù I said timidly. He shook his head. ‚ÄúNo. You want to see what's inside. And I want to show you.‚Äù Fear froze me in my tracks. I couldn't say anything as he walked closer and reached out for the handle to the door. When he opened it a feeling of uneasy confusion washed over me. It was a closet, about 3 feet in width and 4 feet in length. The only thing inside was a wooden chest. It was dark brown and had a large round lock on it. 

The chest was big, taking up most of the space in the closet. I didn't understand what he was trying to show me. Grandpa fished into his pocket and pulled out a key. ‚ÄúLet's take a look inside, shall we?‚Äù He said. I was still frozen in place. I no longer wanted to see what was inside, but I hoped he would open it quickly so we could get the ordeal over with and move on to my inevitable punishment. Kneeling down, he unlocked the chest and motioned for me to open it. Hesitantly, I grabbed the edges of the lid and lifted the top. 

Before I had a chance to recognize the contents of the box I was grabbed from behind. Kicking and screaming I begged to be let go, but I was too small and weak to fight against him. He shoved me forcefully into the chest and slammed the lid shut. I continued to scream, and from outside the box, I could hear the old man howling with laughter. ‚ÄúMaybe this will teach you not to go snooping in other people's business!‚Äù he bellowed. I pushed up on the top of the box but it didn't budge. The monster had locked it. 

Through my tears, I listened as his footsteps walked away. I heard him climb the stairs and shut the basement door as he exited. After a few more moments of crying, I assessed the contents of the chest. It was too dark to see clearly. The chest had small, almost unnoticeable gaps along the seams in the edges, and being in a closet there wasn't much light available to seep through. 

When put into dark spaces the pupils dilate in order to capture as many photons as possible. It takes time, but as long as there is a small trace of light, the eyes will adjust to it to the best of their abilities. When my young eyes eventually captured the small hint of visibility I was afforded within the box, I began to scream again. With me in the old wooden chest were the remains of a half dozen or so rabbits. Soft fur mixed with sticky congealed blood hugged me from every angle.¬†

I am not sure how long I was left in the box. It must have been hours because eventually when my grandfather returned to let me out the sky was dark and it was time for bed. Everything changed after that night. I was still afforded the liberty of roaming the house and forest during the day, but at night I was always led downstairs, where my grandfather would put me in the box, and I would spend the night there. 

In the mornings when he would go hunting, he would let me out and take me hunting with him. My job was the carry the rabbits after he had shot them. After breakfast, he would show me how to remove the bones. These were his real trophies. With twine and sticks, he would bind them together to form symbols. Sigils of sorts I guess. He was always vague about what they were meant for, but he believed they held the power to ward off evil. The kind of evil was never specified. 

After crafting the symbols we would walk around the forest and hang them on trees. The bloodied coats were placed into the chest. He claimed they held special importance as well, but never told me what he did with them. When the chest was filled with nine skins he would take them out to his truck and drive away with them. Maybe he was selling them, but the way he talked about them made it seem as though they held sacred powers as well. I guess I'll never know for sure what he did with them. Eventually, the summer ended, and I went back to live with my mother once more. I never saw either of my grandparents again.¬†

That brings me to why I am writing this. Many years have passed since that summer at the farm. I buried my trauma, and despite all odds, I've actually grown up to be pretty successful. I'm a social worker who specializes in neglected children‚Äôs cases. I live a humble, quiet life, and it suits me. 

But the other day, out of the blue, I received a call from an executor of my grandfather‚Äôs will. I guess the old man finally kicked the bucket. Apparently, he had left me something, too. I was hesitant to accept a meeting with the representative at first. I didn't really need or want the man‚Äôs money, or whatever he left me. But I decided to go anyway, at least to placate my curiosity. 

We met in a law building filled to the brim with men and women in suits looking far too busy. My job has its own fair share of hustle, paperwork, and long days, so I could sympathize with the people milling about me. The conference room was on the second floor. I scaled to the top and paused.

12 stairs.

When we entered the conference room I was asked to sit down, look over a few papers, and sign them. Skimming the documents I grew confused and asked for clarification about the itemized inheritance. Under my name, there was a number one. ‚ÄúExcuse me, what does this one next to my name mean?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúThat's the amount of items left for you specifically by your grandfather in the will.‚Äù the representative explained. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶what is it? What did he leave me?‚Äù¬†

He turned to the closet in the conference room and fished out a key from his pocket. When he opened the door, lying on the floor was a large, dark brown, wooden chest.

1i725eb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i725eb/is_there_an_alternative_to_ciprofloxicam_i_have_a/,Is there an alternative to ciprofloxicam? I have a lot going on‚Ä¶,"Female, 40yo, 155lbs. No medications. Chronic anemia.  Tests first week of Jan - 
215 cholesterol
slightly elevated ldl
iron deficiency (always a problem) saturation all time low of 6 percent. 
Tibc above high normal
uibc above high normal
Vitamin d low at 15. 
B12 in range but also on the very low end. 
I am constantly getting out of breath and having heart palpitations when just sitting/lying down. 


So... I committed to a new years full change of diet and vowed to actually take my supplements everyday. I always forget or the iron makes me feel sickly so I avoided them. My results have never been this low and I've always been able to manage.  Also I planned to get back to exercising once I got my diet under control.

Which I did... I dropped all cholesterol except for lean meat once a day for dinner, no butter, cream, pasta, white bread etc. eating oats, beans, chickpeas, lentils, vegetables and fruit... and just two weeks later 
My cholesterol was in range, ldl in range, tibc just a few over normal and uibc back in range. Iron saturation up to 15percent and vitamin d 21. B12 test was an after thought so not enough time has passed to retest that. All awesome stuff! I had more energy and positive mindset. Brain fog lifted as it has done in the past when I sorted my iron out. My shortness of breath after getting up or going upstairs did not go away though but figured that would take more time given such low numbers.

However... this past week I had stronger looking pee and back pain. I presumed the pee was from having some coffee this week which I usually avoid and maybe all the supplements I‚Äôve been taking religiously. No burning/pain when peeing etc, no itchy or discomfort whatsoever. Back pain I always have coming and going from a degenerative disk. No meds or over the counter taken for it though. I know my limits and what can aggravate it so I figured it was the usual. 

Then yesterday my back pain moved upwards and felt very different than usual and was constant. Today it continued all day non stop like an ache but also feeling of something very wrong. So I picked up some uti test strips from cvs and it came back high for leukocytes (may be spelling that incorrectly). So I headed to urgent care and they tested too and it came back an infection and doc thinks it's probably moved to my kidney given symptoms.
He's prescribed me ciprofloxicam and told me not to do any heavy lifting while taking it. I told him I literally just joined the gym around the corner. damn. But then, it‚Äôs not a huge deal if I wait a week and just focus on lots of walking.
But now I'm home, I've been having a google about the medication and I'm reading that it can cause problems with my tendons for MONTHS after taking it. How true is this? Do I have be careful lifting weights and intense exercise for months? Is there an alternative antibiotic I could take that wouldn't cause this side effect?  I need to lose weight and build strength to support and keep trending my other issues down. My glucose was barely over fasting range so prediabetes needs to be addressed and my recent weight gain (past few years) I am sure is the culprit.

Also, worst news of the day too‚Ä¶ when they took my blood pressure it first showed 183/93!! I didn‚Äôt realize how bad that was until I texted my husband while waiting on the doctor. He presumed they were sending me to the ER. I was like, what?? The nurse came in and hooked me up for another one but with a five min timer to see if it would go down. I sat and focused on breathing and calming. Second result was 158/105.  I have heard of white coat syndrome but I wasnt anxious or anything. I was convinced/knew I had a uti so I was just going through the motions. I wasn‚Äôt concerned of any other medical issue.  Everything was going great in that regard. I had just pee‚Äôd In the test cup in the bathroom and walked back out, sat down and they called my name immediately. So back up and I guess walked with speed to the other side to follow the nurse. 

The doctor didn‚Äôt say anything about my initial blood pressure. Or even the second even though it‚Äôs high. He just came in the room, told me the results and gave me my prescription (and info about not doing any heavy lifting as it can soften/damage tendons).

So of course I‚Äôve been googling and 158/105 is terrible too! What if it‚Äôs only that number too because I was actively calming myself and focusing on lowering during those five mins? What‚Äôs my ongoing Bp? 

I also read on my prescription to not take iron, calcium or multi vitamins two hours before or four hours after taking ciprofloxicam. I can‚Äôt take iron and calcium and vitamin d together so I have my coffee first thing with calcium fortified oat milk (because I‚Äôve dropped cheese from my diet), then later the iron and b12 with breakfast. Then afternoon/evening I take my vitamin d. How am I going to squeeze all those in staggered along with my twice a prescription with all the timing before and after taking it?

And now with my blood pressure freaking me out I have just learned I can‚Äôt work out‚Ä¶ possibly for months.

Sorry for the really long post here but I‚Äôm feeling very overwhelmed and stressed out while also being very aware that I can‚Äôt allow myself to be stressed out. Ugh. 

What should I do??? 

Also... what if the ongoing shortness of breath isn't iron related but blood pressure related?! I really don't want statins. I KNOW I can address this with diet and exercise. But I need to be able to actually exercise to do that.",1,1737517516.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

Psychologically I have had no issues dropping the habit. However, the physically withdrawal symptoms have totally f\*cked me up. I had a migraine for 3 days that has slowly subsided. I still have brain fog. This has been tolerable. The worst is the back and glute pain. Sitting, standing, laying down has been unbearable. I had the worst sleep of my life last night due to back pain. 

Today, on day 5, I have decided I will taper my coffee drinking instead of going cold turkey. I will drink one cup per day for the next week. Then go down to one cup every second day and so on. 

I have no prior addiction problems. I smoked (lightly) and drank when I was younger. I had no problems dropping these vices cold turkey. I am quite shocked that I am suffering so badly. I can't imagine what its like for someone trying to kick an opiate addiction.

I recently went on vacation and a payment that shouldn‚Äôt have come out did and I was short $50 for insurance and asked my sister to borrow it while my refund comes in (3-5 days). She said sure and then said how she was tight for money because her boyfriend didn‚Äôt get paid last month as he wasn‚Äôt working. 

She never sent the money, which is fine because i got paid from one of my jobs so it balanced out without her help. 

When I was in the airport on my way home, I had mentioned how I was upset that the friend I traveled with complained a lot and i wish I had gone on my trip alone like originally planned. I did enjoy my friends company but I would‚Äôve been able to do more of what I wanted. My sister told me I needed to stop complaining and all I did was complain and be negative all the time. (This is untrue I often get compliments from strangers on how they love my positivity) it really upset me and I brought up how I wished she would‚Äôve said no to sending money instead of saying yes. (She was also flaunting new things she had bought including a $110 coffee maker). She lost it on me saying I was ungrateful and like I slapped her in the face and how selfish I am. She said she sent the payment but I never received it I showed her my bank statement as proof. She told me that I‚Äôm negative and that I needed to be more positive. 

I told her that I would be mia because I needed space and she went off and twisted it and said she couldn‚Äôt stand me and other hurtful things and I just removed her from my social media.  I don‚Äôt have her blocked, but I know she won‚Äôt talk to me. 

I left the souvenir I got her from vacation in between her doors when I picked up my car when I got back (she usually uses it when I‚Äôm away as her and her bf only have one car). 

I love my sister a lot and I wish she was more emotionally mature to have a relationship with. I feel this is a lot of projection on her end. I have spent too much time healing and going to therapy over the last 5 years for her to tear it down.  I‚Äôm just tired of being triggered into meltdowns (I‚Äôm autistic/Adhd/ Cptsd) because she makes me feel like shit. I‚Äôm worried that she will convince my parents not to talk to me anymore too because she did that last time we went no contact. I didn‚Äôt hear from my parents or her for 3 years. 

She also dragged my little sister (16f) into it by saying she told my (26f) sister all I did was complain to her about my trip, when I did not and my little sister said that wasn‚Äôt true.

Now all the normal seemingly innocent things she usually does with him feel inappropriate but I don't know if I'm overreacting since she's never acted on her feelings. 

Sorry this is a long one! I struggle with differentating between relevant and irrelevant info when recounting things haha.

A couple days before Christmas, my SO (33M) and I (33F) hosted several of our friends for a casual afternoon/evening get-together. We had informed everyone that, while I worked until about 4:30 (I work from home), they were welcome to come anytime after 2 as my SO would also be home and ready to entertain. My close friend who we'll call Abby (31F) was the only one who showed up right at 2 while everyone else said they couldn't make it until after 4 at the earliest.

For some additional context, Abby and I had met in college and have been close ever since, going so far as to call each other ""sister"". Also, up until now, I have never had a problem with the relationship between Abby and SO either. They behave very much like siblings as well.

So back to the story, since Abby had shown up so early and I still had 2+ hours left of my shift, SO hung out with her in the living room. I came down from my office at one point for a little break and to greet her and they were just sitting next to each other on the couch chit chatting. Everything was normal. Eventually, my work day ended and the rest of our friends arrived.

The next morning, my SO and I are on the couch enjoying our morning coffee when he suddenly asks, ""Has Abby ever told you she's attracted to me?"". I was immediately confused. I just said no and asked why. So he proceeded to tell me that while the two of them were talking, he had asked Abby about how dating was going because she didn't often talk about her dating life. She'd said that she wasn't really interested in dating and the idea of relationships seemed too complicated. SO asked if she may be asexual and not feel attracted to people. She replied, ""No, I definitely enjoy sex and am attracted to people. For example, I'm attracted to you and the only reason I haven't acted on it is because of OP."" SO was caught off guard by the statement and he figured Abby could tell because she immediately followed up with something to the effect of, ""I'm pretty sure I told OP this."" I assure you, she did not. I have the memory of a goldfish but I feel like if one of my closest friends told me THIS, I'd remember because of how it has me feeling now. 

He told me that she then cuddled up to him. Like body pressed up next to him on the couch, head on his shoulder. This is not abnormal for her. She's always been a pretty touchy-feely person, even with me. And she's done it to my SO before tons of times but again, neither if us had a problem with it because it always had big bro hugging lil' sis vibes. But SO said this time made him kind of uncomfortable given the confession Abby had just made. He said he felt like he shouldn't have let her do it because now it felt like some kind of betrayal to me. But he was afraid if he stopped her, it would have made things weird for the rest of the night since it had never been a problem before. I assured him I wasn't upset with him and thanked him for letting me know. 

The conversation moved on but I did not. This had been eating away at me since then. Like on my mind 24/7. I originally resolved to just put it at the back of my mind as Abby just being weird (she do be an odd duck) but we were out to lunch not long ago just the three of us and Abby said, ""if you're interested, you're more than welcome to come to my house next week and we can hang out in my room or the basement and put in a movie."" I assumed the invitation was extended to the both of us and that she meant the next weekend so I began to say that I didn't think next week would work when she cut me off mid-sentence to say, ""I know YOU'RE not available during the week OP, but for SO, he can shoot me a text whenever he's lonely or bored and he can come over to watch a movie or whatever."" For context, my SO is temporarily on leave from his job to work on his mental health and has been struggling to adjust to having a wide open schedule with not much to do these past couple of months, which is what prompted Abby to say what she did.

But anyway, I kinda froze in the moment not sure how to respond. Again, Abby has done this before, inviting just my SO out (he's never been interested in taking her up on it) but I never thought anything of it BEFORE I knew she had feelings for him. But now it feels highly inappropriate knowing what I know. 

I'm not sure what I should do with this information. I don't think I'm at a point where I'm wanting to end the friendship with Abby because I still trust her to continue to not act on her feelings. But I still feel like I need to keep her at arms length now too. I'm also confused as to WHY she confessed her feelings to him in the first place if she wasn't planning on doing anything with these feelings. Like did she not realize the bomb she'd just dropped? Am I the only one who feels like a bomb was dropped? She could have named literally ANYONE ELSE as an example of someone she was attracted to but she named my SO specifically and TO my SO. And why would she say she told me this when she hadn't? Is she just misremembering? Is it one of those situations where she tried to tell me without telling me? Did she straight up lie to him so he wouldn't bring it up to me? Or so he'd feel less awkward? My mind has been REELING. I feel like I need to set a boundary with her but what is even the boundary? ""Quit being attracted to my hubby, or else?"" WHAT DO I DO? Am I blowing this out of proportion since she hasn't actually done anything and I'm just being an insecure brat? Or do I have a right to feel weird and distrustful of her now?",4,1737516662.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False

1i71tgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1i71tgd/i_bought_an_old_phone_at_a_thrift_store_and_it/,"I Bought an Old Phone at a Thrift Store, and It Has Photos of My House","I‚Äôm not one to post stuff like this online, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about what happened, and maybe someone here will have an explanation.

A couple of weeks ago, I went to a local thrift store to look for cheap electronics. I mess around with old phones as a hobby taking them apart, salvaging parts, that sort of thing. It‚Äôs a small-town store, the kind where everything is dusty, and half the inventory is donated junk that probably should‚Äôve been thrown out.

Among the usual piles of broken flip phones and ancient chargers, I found a smartphone. It wasn‚Äôt anything fancy, but it was intact and priced at only $10. The back was scratched up, and there was a sticker residue on it, but it looked like it might work. I didn‚Äôt even test it; I just grabbed it and paid.

When I got home, I powered it up out of curiosity. To my surprise, it turned on without needing a charge. It was slow and glitchy, but functional. I thought maybe I‚Äôd gotten lucky and could salvage more than just parts.

Here‚Äôs where things get‚Ä¶ weird.

The phone wasn‚Äôt wiped. That‚Äôs not super uncommon with thrifted electronics, but it‚Äôs always a little odd to see someone‚Äôs life still stored on a device they got rid of. There weren‚Äôt many apps installed, and most of the phone seemed pretty empty, but there were photos. A lot of them.

The first few were normal: blurry shots of a dog, random images of the inside of a car. The timestamps were inconsistent, suggesting the photos were taken over a span of years.

Then I noticed one of the photos looked familiar.

It was a picture of a white house. The angle was odd, like it was taken from the street or a distance. But it wasn‚Äôt just any house... it was my house.

At first, I thought it was a coincidence. My house is an older model, one of those cookie-cutter types you see all over small towns. But as I kept scrolling, there were more photos. Close-ups of my front door, my mailbox, my car in the driveway.

The timestamps on these photos were recent.

My stomach dropped. I couldn‚Äôt understand why someone would have pictures of my house, let alone why they were on a phone I‚Äôd just randomly picked up. I kept scrolling, my hands getting clammy. The photos became more invasive.

One was taken through my living room window.

I don‚Äôt have curtains in that room just blinds I usually keep halfway open. In the photo, the angle was low, like it was taken from someone crouching outside. You could see part of my couch and the corner of the coffee table.

Then came a photo of my bedroom window. This one was at night. The flash reflected in the glass, and through it, you could see my bed and part of the nightstand.

I don‚Äôt know how many photos there were in total. I stopped counting after a while. Some were old, judging by the foliage or the state of my yard. Others looked like they were taken within the last few weeks.

I don‚Äôt have neighbors close enough to see into my windows, and I don‚Äôt remember anyone ever lurking around. I live alone, and my house is on the edge of town, bordered by woods.

The last photo I looked at before I shut the phone off was of my backyard. It was taken from the tree line, facing the house. You could see the back porch light on and the sliding glass door. I swear I could make out my shadow through the curtains.

I haven‚Äôt been able to bring myself to look at the phone again. I shoved it in a drawer in my garage, but sometimes I feel like I can hear it vibrating or buzzing, even though I know it‚Äôs probably just my imagination.

I‚Äôve started triple-checking that all my doors and windows are locked, and I bought blackout curtains for every room. I don‚Äôt know who owned that phone or why they had those photos. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre still out there.

But every time I think about it, I get the same creeping feeling I had when I realized those photos weren‚Äôt just random. They were deliberate.

I'd have thoughts throughout the day but would often skip recording them - by the time I unlocked my phone, opened an app, and started typing, I'd either forget the details or lose motivation.

As a developer, I decided to solve this problem for myself. I created a simple app that lets me speak my tasks and uses AI to organize them. It's been a game-changer for my daily workflow - what used to take 30 seconds to type now takes 5 seconds to speak.For example, when thoughts come up during a walk or while making coffee, I just speak them naturally: ""Need to review the project proposal next Monday and send feedback to Sarah by Wednesday."" 

The AI helps structure these into proper tasks.I'm sharing this here because it might help others who face similar challenges.

**You: Oh no, I did not come to reddit to hear about Kendu again. It's all I have been reading on Reddit over the last 6 months and got tired of it.**

Me: I completely understand why you feel that way. We have been shilling Kendu non stop over the past few months. But trust me this is not just another update- a transformation has unfolded in Kendu, one that I believe is a game-changer, not just for Kendu but for the entire memecoin space.

**You: Okay. So what is the latest buzz about Kendu?**

Me: Kendu just had its ‚Äúphoenix moment.‚Äù It‚Äôs risen from the ashes of developer drama, betrayal and is now 100% community-driven. Finally after months of chaos and challenges, the community has taken full control

**You: Wait, Chaos, Drama? Betrayal? What happened!**
 
Me: Picture this: for months, the Kendu community is working tirelessly, pouring their hearts and souls into building something extraordinary. But there was one little problem: the dev. Yes, the dev‚Äîthe person who was supposed to lead the charge‚Äîdecided to moonwalk in the opposite direction. Sabotage? Check. Ignoring community desires? Double-check. Trying to bury Kendu six feet under? Triple-check¬†*(The reason Kendu market cap was going down over the past few months)*. But guess what? The dev underestimated the power of the community. Spoiler alert: the community won.

Basically we had our Batman moment. Dev is Ra al Ghul and Kendu community is Batman :)

**You: How did the community manage to pull this off and what happened to Dev?**

Me: With sheer determination, some serious grit, and probably a lot of Kendu energy drinks, the community rallied together, took control, and staged a takeover that would be worth of a Netflix documentary. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but the got the dev to send back the remaining tokens to the donations wallet. Translation? The dev is out, the community is in, and those tokens are now ammunition for listings, marketing, and spreading the Kendu gospel.

**You: That sounds intense. What‚Äôs next for Kendu?**

Me: Oh, just a clean slate, a fresh start, and a chance to rewrite history. No big deal. The community is embracing a decentralized, transparent, and adaptable approach. Imagine a Kendu that‚Äôs not tied to any one person but is instead a movement fueled by belief and true conviction.

**You: Has this brought back old supporters and how is crypto world reacting to this?**  
Me: Absolutely. It‚Äôs like a reunion. Hundreds of old faces have returned to the Telegram group. And the whales who had been waiting on the sidelines and everyone is ready to push Kendu to new heights. And the result -*you can see for yourself*

**You: I understand that Kendu is turning a new chapter, But what makes Kendu different from other memecoins?**  
Me: Where do I even start? For starters, Kendu is the second memecoin ever to complete a Certik audit organically besides Pepe. It‚Äôs also the second to have its own Stocktwits page and has been featured in top-tier CEX campaigns and advertisements (Coinbase). Add to that a thriving community with real-world products (energy drinks, coffee, jewellery etc), members rocking Kendu tattoos, and one of the healthiest token distributions in DeFi. Oh, and did I mention the SOL wormhole? Yes, Kendu is available both on ETH and SOL

**You: What‚Äôs the ultimate goal for Kendu?**  
Me: Billions, baby. The community took it to a $280M market cap in 2024 in bear market , and now with 17,000 holders, there is no limit to where Kendu can go. we‚Äôve proven that the Kendu movement is unstoppable, a once-in-a-cycle opportunity that‚Äôs here to dominate. It‚Äôs not just a memecoin; it‚Äôs a genuine brand, a movement, and‚Äîdare I say it‚Äîa way of life.

**You: Is it too late to get involved?**  
Me: Not at all. In fact, now is the perfect time. If you‚Äôve been sitting on the sidelines, now‚Äôs the time to jump in.

I deleted the original posts off my page hoping I would stop getting messages about it. But now I have this update. Is it allowed? I don't remember the etiquette here.

I found that my post is still on Reddit. Someone DM'd it to me. Catch up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1cw6m4s/i_think_this_woman_is_using_me_for_freechildcare/).

The short of it is you guys were right, this woman had a crush on me or some kind of interest in the least.. and I was too angry at her / the situation to notice. We're seeing each other now. I won't get your hopes up because it's probably just temporary.

Longer story: Towards the end of last year she approached me. She said she was separating from her husband and hinted that the marriage was abusive. She said her reason for getting in touch with me was to take me up on my offer about teaching her how to box. I told her I was only offering (back then) so I could make her suffer.

The thing is,  I don't think joining a combat sport immediately as a means to process abuse is always the best form of action. I get why it's empowering but if you're not doing therapy or something alongside it.. it might frame things for you in an unhealthy way. So I think you need both. That's just my personal opinion. I felt ill-equipped to be the starting point of her healing or whatever, even though she was reaching out to me so sincerely.

So I redirected her to someone else.

She started going to those classes I connected her with and occasionally texted me about them. Straightforward texts, questions, asking me my opinion etc. We'd have short exchanges, a few texts back and forth with no pattern and a lot of gaps in between.

About a week ago, I ran into her in person and she convinced me to have coffee with her and..

I don't know how to explain it. There is some kind of intensity between us and we decided to see where it leads.

It's not serious or anything.. but I also don't know what it is.

Given how many people thought something was there and how oblivious I was to it... I felt this might be worth sharing.

I didn't know her age back then but I found out she's 32. I'm 25. (I know).",21,1737516403.0,AITAH,22,0.96,False

We hit it off and I asked her out to coffee, we talked and went on a walk and had an all around good time. I‚Äôm fairly inexperienced when it comes to dating so I walked her to her car said our goodbyes and left. 

I reached out the same day expressing how I‚Äôd had a good time and wanted to take her out again. She agreed and we met for lunch about a week later. Again it went good, I felt a little more awkward do to the environment and social anxiety flaring up but at the end of the date she had had a great time. We planned the next one and then she kissed me goodbye and I was like a giddy child lol. 

The third date came and we went on a walk with our dogs. This time I was much more comfortable around her and we kissed more freely. After about an hour and a half we went back to her place with the pups and talked some more. This time we were much more intimate though. For about two hours we sat on her couch cuddling, the usual her legs over mine situation, and we just talked about our lives and more made out than kissed. 

To me it felt like everything was going super well, I would have liked for her to ask more about me but there is always time for that in my head. After being with each other four hours we decided we needed to get up and continue with our day. Before we left I asked if she‚Äôd like to meet up again the following Friday, she suggested a hike and I agreed that that would be fun. Then she kissed me goodbye and we went our separate ways. 

We stayed in fairly consistent contact, we are both students still and I work so it wasn‚Äôt like texting all day every day but consistent. I reached out to see if I could help her watch her dog ahead of our next meeting and just chill and do homework in each other‚Äôs presence. She told me she would have to let me know later into the weekend. 

So Sunday morning rolls around and I get a text from her, initially I thought it would be her telling me if meeting sooner was going to work, but it was actually her very kindly saying she didn‚Äôt want to see me anymore. Which I respect totally despite my own feelings towards her. I let her know that and I also asked if there had been something I‚Äôd done that made her ‚Äúlose interest‚Äù. She told me it was more of a gut feeling about our personalities not matching what she would usually be looking for in a partner and she reassured me that she appreciated me being a ‚Äúperfect gentleman‚Äù throughout our dating and that I would make someone very happy one day. 

Everything here happened across three meetings and spanned over the course of 21ish days. 

Since we stopped messaging at the start of the week I‚Äôve felt honestly kinda shit. And not because I‚Äôm mad at her or myself I don‚Äôt think. I feel like I‚Äôve been mourning the death of a relationship that had yet to bloom. Which sounds so dumb and cliche. Am I crazy for having these feelings or is this just what it‚Äôs like dating as you get older and you‚Äôre dating people with more experience than you?

I suffered some head trauma after a fall on back and front of head. 

This is not my first head injury, I've had at least 3 prior, but only one resulted in loss in passing out and that was in childhood.

I didn't feel anything except pain. No headache or loss of consciousness or sensitivity to light. Was nauseous but was also also nauseous prior.

2 hours post injury I started to feel a small headache. Like the kind I feel when I haven't had coffee by 12 pm. It got worse and become a proper tension like headache 6 hours post injury. I took Tylenol, it got better and went to bed. My head was sore and was hard to get comfortable. Was not the worst the worst headache and for better with Tylenol.

Woke up feeling completely fine. Felt rested. Went about my day. Got a headache half way through the day, took Tylenol. Felt better. When I laid down I started to feel some pressure ish in my back of my head. Like a small version of my head injury in the back. I only feel this when laying down. 

I'm almost done with day 3 post injury. Still having this pain when I lay down. I don't feel confused or nauseous.

Normally he always reaches out first & will even call me if I haven‚Äôt replied in a while. I was surprised he didn‚Äôt even shoot me a text for a whole day. I feel like if a guy likes a girl, he would go out of his way to hear from her or let her know what‚Äôs up?

We work at the same office so I woke up to a text from him TODAY & he just acted like nothing happened ‚Äî asked if I wanted a coffee.

I expressed that it honestly made me really mad that he didn‚Äôt communicate with me & he simply just said he wanted to give me space considering that I didn‚Äôt reply to his emoji (he didn‚Äôt even send a written text last). Am I overreacting because I found this super weird.",0,1737515759.0,AmIOverreacting,14,0.25,False

**You: Oh no, I did not come to reddit to hear about Kendu again. It's all I have been reading on Reddit over the last 6 months and got tired of it.**

Me: I completely understand why you feel that way. We have been shilling Kendu non stop over the past few months. But trust me this is not just another update- a transformation has unfolded in Kendu, one that I believe is a game-changer, not just for Kendu but for the entire memecoin space.

**You: Okay. So what is the latest buzz about Kendu?**

Me: Kendu just had its ‚Äúphoenix moment.‚Äù It‚Äôs risen from the ashes of developer drama, betrayal and is now 100% community-driven. Finally after months of chaos and challenges, the community has taken full control

**You: Wait, Chaos, Drama? Betrayal? What happened!**
 
Me: Picture this: for months, the Kendu community is working tirelessly, pouring their hearts and souls into building something extraordinary. But there was one little problem: the dev. Yes, the dev‚Äîthe person who was supposed to lead the charge‚Äîdecided to moonwalk in the opposite direction. Sabotage? Check. Ignoring community desires? Double-check. Trying to bury Kendu six feet under? Triple-check¬†*(The reason Kendu market cap was going down over the past few months)*. But guess what? The dev underestimated the power of the community. Spoiler alert: the community won.

Basically we had our Batman moment. Dev is Ra al Ghul and Kendu community is Batman :)

**You: How did the community manage to pull this off and what happened to Dev?**

Me: With sheer determination, some serious grit, and probably a lot of Kendu energy drinks, the community rallied together, took control, and staged a takeover that would be worth of a Netflix documentary. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but the got the dev to send back the remaining tokens to the donations wallet. Translation? The dev is out, the community is in, and those tokens are now ammunition for listings, marketing, and spreading the Kendu gospel.

**You: That sounds intense. What‚Äôs next for Kendu?**

Me: Oh, just a clean slate, a fresh start, and a chance to rewrite history. No big deal. The community is embracing a decentralized, transparent, and adaptable approach. Imagine a Kendu that‚Äôs not tied to any one person but is instead a movement fueled by belief and true conviction.

**You: Has this brought back old supporters and how is crypto world reacting to this?**  
Me: Absolutely. It‚Äôs like a reunion. Hundreds of old faces have returned to the Telegram group. And the whales who had been waiting on the sidelines and everyone is ready to push Kendu to new heights. And the result -*you can see for yourself*

**You: I understand that Kendu is turning a new chapter, But what makes Kendu different from other memecoins?**  
Me: Where do I even start? For starters, Kendu is the second memecoin ever to complete a Certik audit organically besides Pepe. It‚Äôs also the second to have its own Stocktwits page and has been featured in top-tier CEX campaigns and advertisements (Coinbase). Add to that a thriving community with real-world products (energy drinks, coffee, jewellery etc), members rocking Kendu tattoos, and one of the healthiest token distributions in DeFi. Oh, and did I mention the SOL wormhole? Yes, Kendu is available both on ETH and SOL

**You: What‚Äôs the ultimate goal for Kendu?**  
Me: Billions, baby. The community took it to a $280M market cap in 2024 in bear market , and now with 17,000 holders, there is no limit to where Kendu can go. we‚Äôve proven that the Kendu movement is unstoppable, a once-in-a-cycle opportunity that‚Äôs here to dominate. It‚Äôs not just a memecoin; it‚Äôs a genuine brand, a movement, and‚Äîdare I say it‚Äîa way of life.

**You: Is it too late to get involved?**  
Me: Not at all. In fact, now is the perfect time. If you‚Äôve been sitting on the sidelines, now‚Äôs the time to jump in. The community has weathered its biggest storm and come out stronger than ever. There‚Äôs nothing stopping them now. As they say, fortune favors the bold‚Äîor in this case, the Kendu believers. So, are you ready to ride this rocket to the moon?

I reach for my phone and go through it, hoping you‚Äôve finally reached out, but you haven‚Äôt and you won‚Äôt because you plain just don‚Äôt want me in your life anymore. And I‚Äôll never ever understand why. I miss you so much, no matter where I am or what I‚Äôm doing I miss you. This separation has been so hard for me, but I hope It‚Äôs brought you the peace you needed. I know I‚Äôm not even a thought of yours anymore and I never will be again, i don‚Äôt know how we‚Äôve ended up here, I don‚Äôt know why I wasn‚Äôt good enough, I don‚Äôt understand how any of this happened.

I know you don‚Äôt sit up at night thinking about me and what we both once shared. You hate me. I miss you so much. It feels like a part of me is missing.

You didn‚Äôt have to cut me out of your life, I was leaving you alone. You believed I was stalking you but actually I was avoiding even going near your road because I didn‚Äôt want you to think what you already believed from the lies you were told. I wonder if you still believe those lies? I‚Äôll never know though will I? Because now I have to live forever without you by my side and honestly I‚Äôm really not coping with that. Yes I still wake up and do my day to day, but I can‚Äôt go one day without wishing you were still here by my side. I really honestly and truly don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing anymore, now that you‚Äôve gone. I thought we had forever my love. I really and truly did and now I don‚Äôt know what to think anymore. I miss you my love, with every fibre of my being. I wish we could work this out because you‚Äôre my person even if I‚Äôm not yours. I don‚Äôt know how to forget you my love, I just don‚Äôt. I keep writing these letters to try and take some of the pain away, there very repetitive I know, but It‚Äôs my true and honest heartfelt emotions. It‚Äôs a testament to how much I love and miss you. I know I can‚Äôt send them, so here is where they will remain. on here and in my heart. I can never tell you how I‚Äôm feeling anymore. I know you will never see this so my thoughts and emotions are safe on here I guess.¬†



I love you, with everything I have and am and I‚Äôm grateful you once loved me too.¬†

I miss you more than words can ever say. Always my love, till this life and the next.

He was asking me such sweet questions as well , and I feel so stupid and naive on the date I gave so many opportunities for him to make a move but he didn‚Äôt try once then after the date he blocked me on Grindr and I messaged him on another app where I could contact him and I asked ‚Äúhey did I something wrong sorry ?‚Äù My anxiety was sky high at this point he replied ‚Äú no , when I meet people from that app I block them ‚Äú I replied ‚Äú ok that‚Äôs cool , is there any possibility of a second date ? ‚Äú then he replies ‚Äúno I think we‚Äôd be better off as friends ‚Äú my heart shattered when I read that *glass shattering noises * I feel so stupid and naive for even going that was my first date ever I ended up paying for coffee he didn‚Äôt even thank me I thought it was going well until that point and I just really want to cry .

First time I really met someone from that app it was around 10 because I got stood up by the last guy , he said I don‚Äôt do things with virgins and I get that it‚Äôs cool and that‚Äôs fine . So this is two separate men .

Just wondering if someone has similar experiences as me and has gotten some clarity on diagnosis for themselves. 
So to begin with a little background info, I was put on birth control when I was 13 (I‚Äôm now 24) due to painful periods. Like so painful that I was in a fetal position and felt like throwing up. I‚Äôve been on birth control ever since then, however, about a month and a half ago I stopped my birth control to see what I‚Äôm like without it. On birth control, I didn‚Äôt experience any cramping or heaviness with my periods. However, now that I‚Äôm off of birth control, my periods are back to being horrible. Back in feb of 2023 I started experiencing an achy feeling in my pelvis. It got so bad that I went to the ER and they found nothing on the CT scan or ultrasound. They found some leukocytes in my urine, gave me some antibiotics, and sent me home. The antibiotics helped for a few days but then I noticed that the pain was there again. That pain lasted for months. I tried to focus on my health and calming my nervous system. I found some relief. Then in September of 2023, I had a kidney stone which led to a horrible UTI. After passing the kidney stone, I continued to feel urinary urgency, pelvic pressure/ache, and a general discomfort in my bladder. At this point I had an xray of my kidneys which showed that there were no more kidney stones and I had urine cultures which showed that I no longer had a uti infection. After countless doctors and negative urine cultures, I found a urogynecologist who told me that I have interstitial cystitis. He put me on hydroxyzine and told me all about the IC diet. For a while my hydroxyzine was working. It was like a reset that prevented huge flares. I also found that coffee and carbonated drinks cause my symptoms to be worse. I also noticed that while on my period, it seemed as if my urinary issues completely disappeared. This past December of 2024, I had a positive uti test. Since then I‚Äôve felt urinary frequency, achy in my back, bladder, and pelvis, and a burning sensation. I have negative urine cultures yet again. I‚Äôm not sure if the uti set off my bladder inflammation or going off of hormonal birth control or maybe a combination of both. My first period off of birth control this past month was painful, heavy, and had many clots. Could this be bladder endometriosis? My urogynecologist said that endo and IC were ‚Äúevil twins.‚Äù Sorry for the long post! Living with this on a daily basis for almost 2 years has been exhausting and I just want some validation and clarity. ",3,1737514875.0,Endo,3,1.0,False

I‚Äôm new to understanding codependency and haven‚Äôt been to meetings or anything, so I‚Äôm still learning the nuances of it. I have some questions about my own behavior. Would love your input!

Most things I‚Äôve read about codependency seem to apply to me - my world revolves around the close relationship, I put their needs above my own, I avoid conflict, I spend every waking moment thinking about them, I take in the caretaker role, etc.

Where I get confused is that I think I DO enjoy my own company! I love going out alone - to coffee shops, to hikes, traveling. But as soon as I have a slight involvement with someone, I am IMMEDIATELY back in my old patterns‚Ä¶ so I find myself avoiding dating at this point because I know it will consume my every cell.

So: can I be codependent if I feel good alone, or is that in conflict with the very definition of codependency? And any tips on ways to moderate this behavior instead of going from one extreme to another? (I guess I should prob read the books and go to meetings, right??)

**This week's [adventure](https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/5/e/5ebac73a-1ecf-4e6d-87b1-ea560bfeb064.jpg?1692937214) is to design an uncommon using a new card frame which has enough design space to feature as a set mechanic.**

Here's [what MaRo had to say about card frames](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/more-maro-maro-2019-12-02):

> ""Card frames have a couple important elements to them. First, there's a functional aspect. They can allow you to do things that might not normally fit on a card by using design elements to convey something that would take a lot of words to communicate, or they could serve as a means to track information that might be a memory issue on a normal card. Second, they can convey a lot of flavor to the card, helping sell the theme of the set. Third, they can be splashy, making the cards more appealing for the players. All of this means that frames are an important tool allowing the designers to make cards and mechanics that they couldn't have ever made in the past.""

Your card frames could solve design problems for mechanics that appear in magic already, such as as how Cases solved a problem with Quests - making them more intuitive and reducing the required text space and tracking involved in quest counters. Or they might enable a new mechanic that otherwise would not work with current card frames.

Don't sweat over doing the graphic design work to actually show off the frame, I don't want this little weekly challenge to turn into a big long [saga](https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/7/d7de696a-49c2-421d-a86c-bcffd68870c6.jpg?1631051336) for you: a description of the card frame and how it functions will more than suffice!

I need advice.,"My biggest issue: impulse buying, eating out (DoorDash, uber eats, date nights, etc.), coffee shops, and‚Ä¶ I feel like there‚Äôs more but I can‚Äôt quite pin point it. 

Anywho, I have a problem. I‚Äôm at a point now that it‚Äôs affecting my mental health. My anxiety is through the roof. I just realized a few minutes ago, because I‚Äôm currently stressed, I wanted to order food‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt have money. So I want to say I emotional buy as well. 

I just don‚Äôt know how to tackle this. I‚Äôve never really had savings, I‚Äôm always in debt, or accumulating more, and when something unexpected happens, I stress out even more and it‚Äôs just a vicious cycle. But I don‚Äôt know how or where to start. I was doing a no buy this year, or that was the plan. Obviously that‚Äôs not happening right now. 

Any advice would be appreciated and maybe some reassurance. What helped you guys get out of the habit of spending? I just want to be able to save, not buy anything, go hiking, and just be‚Ä¶ happy. ",20,1737514607.0,nobuy,17,1.0,False

I started my fitness journey this year with the goal of losing body fat and gaining muscle to tone out my body. I am not overweight but the body fat % is a bit high for me and I‚Äôd like to shed some fat off of my body. I am in a calorie deficit with around 1600-1700 calories a day as my maintenance calories is around 2100. I have absolutely no problem with whole foods and I aim to get in around 120-140 grams of protein a day while limiting my carb and fat intake. My problem is sugar. Me personally, it‚Äôs not so much I want to have all the cookies and cakes in the world it‚Äôs my coffee. I go to Dunkin and get myself a latte with some sort of sweetened syrup and if I make my coffee at home, I experiment with lots of homemade syrups that contain lots of brown sugar, sweetened condensed milk, etc. When it comes to my snacking, I usually opt for stevia sweetened chocolates I find at the grocery store like Lilys brand or Russell Stover. I tried the sugar free syrups route and it was absolutely vile. If I were to enjoy my coffee as my sweet treat for the day while maintaining my diet with my foods in general, would it hinder my results? ",0,1737514581.0,loseit,3,0.5,False
1i712rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1i712rq/the_last_one_for_the_road/,THE LAST ONE FOR THE ROAD,"‚Äî Give me one last drink. ‚Äî The hoarse voice cut through the silence of the nearly empty bar, heavy with impatience.

The bartender, Pituca, glanced up as he wiped a glass with an already grimy rag. He cast a wary look at the man seated at the counter.  
‚Äî You shouldn‚Äôt be drinking, you know? ‚Äî Pituca said, his tone hesitant but firm.

The man raised an eyebrow, almost mocking the advice.  
‚Äî One shot won‚Äôt hurt, Pituca. ‚Äî He leaned slightly forward, resting his elbow on the counter. ‚Äî Just to warm up before I hit the road.

Pituca sighed but didn‚Äôt move.  
‚Äî I don‚Äôt know about this... ‚Äî he murmured, glancing sideways at the glass in his hand. ‚Äî A lot of folks are crashing on those highways... Especially on the BRs.

‚Äî A bunch of cowards! ‚Äî the man shot back with a wry smirk. ‚Äî I‚Äôve been doing this for years, Pituca. I know what I‚Äôm doing. Pour me that last drink. I‚Äôve got a delivery to make tonight.

‚Äî Delivery? ‚Äî Pituca asked, suspicious, as he set the glass down on the counter.

‚Äî Yeah. Heading to Vale Verde.

At the mention of that place, Pituca went pale. He froze, the rag suspended mid-air, his face ghostly white. He said nothing. Turning reluctantly, he began preparing the drink.

Meanwhile, the man glanced around. The bar was nearly empty, the yellowish light casting strange shadows on the walls. Outside, the sound of a cricket seemed to grow louder by the second, as if warning of something.

Pituca placed the glass on the counter, his hand trembling slightly.  
‚Äî Good luck. ‚Äî His voice was almost a whisper.

The man shrugged, grabbed the glass, and downed it in one gulp. Rising from his seat, he noticed Pituca‚Äôs unnerved expression.  
‚Äî Pituca, you okay? ‚Äî I asked, staring at the old bartender. He seemed uneasy, his face paler than usual, his eyes fixed on some invisible point on the counter.

He took a few seconds to respond, and when he finally raised his eyes, his expression was grave.  
‚Äî If I were you, Jhonatan... I wouldn‚Äôt go there.

‚Äî Wouldn‚Äôt go where? ‚Äî I asked, raising an eyebrow. The unexpected reply piqued my curiosity.

‚Äî To Vale Verde. ‚Äî His tone was low, almost a whisper, as if he didn‚Äôt want anyone else to hear, even though the bar was empty except for the two of us.

I laughed, trying to lighten the mood.  
‚Äî Ah, Pituca... What‚Äôs this about? Since when do you believe in that nonsense? You‚Äôre starting to sound like my mom with those scary bedtime stories.

Pituca didn‚Äôt smile. He just shook his head slowly and pressed his lips together. Worry seemed etched into every line of his aged face.  
‚Äî I‚Äôve heard stories about that place since I was a kid, Jhonatan. ‚Äî He sighed, crossing his arms on the counter. ‚Äî That place is bad. Real bad.

‚Äî Bad how, Pituca? Come on, you‚Äôre kidding.

He leaned in closer, his voice now laden with unsettling seriousness.  
‚Äî People disappear there, Jhonatan. No explanation, no trace. They just vanish. Especially kids.

The last phrase stopped my laughter before it even started.  
‚Äî Kids? ‚Äî I asked, now paying attention.

‚Äî Yeah. They get lost in the rows of cornfields and are never seen again. ‚Äî He gestured outside, as if he could visualize the place he was describing. ‚Äî And there‚Äôs no point in searching. They never find anything. Just emptiness... And a strange silence.

‚Äî Alright, alright. ‚Äî I raised my hands, still half-smiling. ‚Äî Just because someone got lost in the fields doesn‚Äôt mean the place is cursed, right?

Pituca was silent for a moment, his gaze fixed on me.  
‚Äî A kid showed up here the other day. Must‚Äôve been about 18, full of bravado. He came with his girlfriend.

I leaned in, intrigued.  
‚Äî And?

He sighed before continuing.  
‚Äî Said he was going to Vale Verde. I tried to warn him. Told him everything I could. But he just laughed in my face.

‚Äî What did he say? ‚Äî I asked, curious.

Pituca closed his eyes for a moment, as if trying to push away the unsettling memory.  
‚Äî He looked at me and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking my girl to the Vale Verde cornfield. It‚Äôs gonna be the best night of my life. You‚Äôll see, you old coward.‚Äù

I laughed briefly, but the sound came out nervous.  
‚Äî Bold kid. Teenagers always think they know everything, huh?

Pituca didn‚Äôt find it funny.  
‚Äî Yeah, I thought the same thing at the time. But a few days later, his parents showed up here. The girl‚Äôs mother too.

‚Äî Looking for them? ‚Äî I asked, my tone now more serious.

He nodded.  
‚Äî They came in desperation, asking if I knew anything. I told them what I knew‚Äîthat they‚Äôd gone to Vale Verde.

‚Äî And then?

Pituca shook his head slowly.  
‚Äî Never heard from them again. Not the parents. Not the girl‚Äôs mother. No one.

The silence that fell over the bar was uncomfortable, like a weight settling over the room. Outside, the wind howled softly, pushing the door, which creaked with every movement.

‚Äî Pituca... ‚Äî I said, trying to ease the tension. ‚Äî I respect you, but I don‚Äôt believe in that stuff. I‚Äôve traveled many roads in my life. Don‚Äôt worry.

He looked at me for a long moment before responding.  
‚Äî There are things in this world, Jhonatan, that we don‚Äôt understand. And some of them... It‚Äôs better not to try.

I finished my drink and placed the glass on the counter with more force than I intended.  
‚Äî Maybe so, but I‚Äôve made up my mind. I‚Äôm going anyway.

Pituca sighed, lowering his head, as if giving up on trying to convince me.  
‚Äî May God protect you, Jhonatan.

I placed some bills on the counter and walked toward the door.  
‚Äî See you around, Pituca. Don‚Äôt worry so much.

Pituca watched the door close with a creak, the sound echoing in the empty bar. He kept his eyes on the entrance as he murmured to himself:  
‚Äî May God go with you...

I climbed into my truck, that iron giant, a 1978 model that was my home on wheels. The smell of diesel oil and worn leather filled the cabin‚Äîa familiar, comforting scent that always accompanied me on the road.

I turned on the battery-powered radio I charged at gas stations, and the heavy sound of AC/DC began to play. ‚ÄúHighway to Hell‚Äù was the perfect soundtrack for the dusk unfolding before me. The clock read close to six in the evening, and the sun was setting on the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and red, as if it were drowning in a sea of fire.

Driving along the highway, my hands gripped the wheel firmly, feeling the vibration of the engine beneath me. The wind blew through the slightly open window, carrying the scent of damp earth and trees lining the road. It was a mix of freedom and loneliness that only life on the road could offer.

Cars passed by, and other trucks crossed my path, with drivers waving or flashing their lights in greeting. I returned the gesture with a brief wave, keeping my eyes on the road. The radio continued playing as I headed toward Vale Verde.

It took me about one or two hours to get near the place. It was a long trip, but I was used to the solitude and silence of the road, interrupted only by the electric guitars of AC/DC. It was 1979, and I was one of the few who had the luxury of a portable TV in my truck. I loved watching movies when parked at rest stops‚Äîa way to escape the monotonous routine.

As the sun disappeared below the horizon, the sky began to change. Dense clouds formed, painting the evening in shades of gray. The wind picked up, carrying the smell of rain that soon started to sprinkle on the windshield‚Äîtiny drops illuminated by the headlights.

Night fell, and the weather worsened. Lightning streaked across the sky like blades, illuminating the cornfield that appeared alongside the road. It was as if the heavens were at war with themselves.

An endless stretch of corn began to appear‚Äîtall green walls extending for miles. My boss had mentioned this, saying Vale Verde was famous for its cornfields and known as one of the greenest towns in the country. He also claimed that nearly all the residents were wealthy, owners of the sprawling fields.

I found it hard to believe. Brazil was a land of inequalities, and thinking an entire town could be wealthy sounded like one of those exaggerated trucker tales. Maybe just idle chatter. Either way, the landscape was both impressive and oppressive, with that sea of corn hemming in the road.

The rain thickened, falling heavy and relentless. The windshield wipers worked hard, leaving wet trails on the glass as the headlights seemed to dissolve in the curtain of water. The sound of AC/DC still played faintly, mixed with the pattering rain and distant thunderclaps.

Then I saw it.

A figure emerged from the cornfield by the roadside.

I slammed the brakes hard, the truck skidding several meters before coming to a stop. The sound of the tires screeching on the wet pavement echoed through the night.

¬† I jumped out of the truck, my heart racing as if trying to burst out of my chest. The rain was pouring down in torrents, soaking my clothes within seconds. The headlights illuminated a girl stumbling out of the cornfield.

She was covered in blood.

‚Äî Are you okay? ‚Äî I shouted, running toward her. My voice felt small against the roar of the rain and thunder.

She didn‚Äôt respond. Her eyes were wide, her face pale, almost gray. Blood trickled from a cut on her forehead, mixing with the rain. She looked lost, her hair plastered to her face and her clothes torn.

‚Äî Hey, talk to me! ‚Äî I insisted, carefully grabbing her shoulders. I could feel her body trembling under my hands.

She mumbled something, but it was impossible to understand over the noise around us. The only thing I could grasp was the metallic scent of blood mingling with the sweet, earthy smell of corn that seemed to permeate the air around us.

‚Äî What happened? ‚Äî I asked, trying to drown out the storm‚Äôs noise.

She lifted her eyes to meet mine, filled with terror, and whispered something that chilled me to the bone:  
‚Äî They‚Äôre coming.

‚Äî Who? Who‚Äôs coming?

She started crying, her sobs muffled by the roaring wind. I pointed toward the truck.  
‚Äî Come on, I‚Äôll get you out of here. Move!

The girl hesitated, glancing back at the cornfield. She looked emaciated, and beneath the torn clothes, her skin bore bruises and scars. My stomach turned as I noticed the raw, exposed flesh where one of her hands should have been.

The shock made me pause. Thoughts raced through my mind‚Äîa lunatic in Vale Verde, a pedophile who had assaulted her and mutilated her. What if he was watching me now, hidden in the cornfield, observing my every move?

My blood froze. Pituca‚Äôs words came flooding back: ‚ÄúVale Verde is evil.‚Äù The place felt cursed, and though the rain had lightened, it still fell heavily, as if trying to bury everything beneath its weight.

Even without the wind, the rustling of the cornfield‚Äôs leaves grew louder, mingling with the sound of the raindrops hitting them. I glanced at the endless rows of corn, and the noise seemed to take on a life of its own. A chill ran down my spine, and the feeling of being watched became unbearable.

I ran back to the truck, my hands still smeared with the girl‚Äôs blood. I was drenched, but that was the least of my worries. I thought about returning to the bar, but it was too far. With no other choice, I continued down the road toward Vale Verde, leaving the girl‚Äôs body by the cornfield‚Äôs edge.

As I walked, surrounded by the endless rows of corn, a distant light appeared on the horizon. It was the town. A small sense of relief surfaced in the midst of the darkness.

Crossing into Vale Verde, I was met with an almost surreal sight: the town seemed untouched by the poverty I knew so well. Grand houses, luxurious mansions, and elegant buildings lined the streets‚Äînot a single structure could be described as humble. Even the smaller homes looked like they belonged in a European architecture magazine.

The rain still fell, cascading off the pristine roofs and paving the streets with an almost supernatural glow.

I reached the police station. Inside, a bald officer with white hair and a protruding belly looked at me over his glasses.  
‚Äî How can I help you, young man? ‚Äî he asked in a deep, disinterested voice.

‚Äî I found a girl by the side of the road, ‚Äî I said hesitantly.

He frowned.  
‚Äî You‚Äôre not from around here, are you, friend?

‚Äî I‚Äôm a trucker. I saw her on the road... Abused and missing a hand.

The officer sighed, as if he‚Äôd heard stories like this before.  
‚Äî Probably some wild animal.

Wild animal? I thought, confused. It would have to be a massive creature to do all that. But the way he said it so nonchalantly unnerved me.

The wet leather of my jacket, mixed with the iron scent of dried blood, was starting to make me nauseous. The station was cold and smelled of old paper and stale coffee. Outside, the sound of rain mingled with the distant rustling of the cornfield, its presence lingering like an unshakable shadow.

¬†‚Äî What‚Äôs your name, friend? ‚Äî the officer asked casually, though his tone hinted at something more.

‚Äî Jhonatan Rodrigues.

‚Äî How old are you?

‚Äî I‚Äôm 20.

‚Äî And kids? Anyone who‚Äôd miss you?

The question caught me off guard.  
‚Äî Yeah... I have a wife and two kids. But why do you ask?

The officer gave a quick, almost awkward smile.  
‚Äî Nothing, nothing. Just part of the job. You know, gathering a bit of info here and there. Are you Christian, friend?

‚Äî I am. My whole family‚Äôs been baptized.

‚Äî Ah, good... ‚Äî He paused, wiping his forehead as if deep in thought. ‚Äî You‚Äôre here to deliver to the mayor, right?

‚Äî I think so.

‚Äî Alright, I‚Äôll take care of your case. As soon as you unload the delivery, I‚Äôll send a patrol to look for the girl.

‚Äî Alright.

I left the station with a strange feeling in my chest. I got into my truck and drove the load to the agreed location. As I navigated through Vale Verde‚Äôs streets, something deeply unsettled me. The city was luxurious, but it felt incomplete. There wasn‚Äôt a single church.

That struck me. Anywhere else in the country, it‚Äôs normal to see churches on every corner, next to bars or supermarkets. There‚Äôs always a cross marking the horizon of any small town. But here? Nothing.

I decided to keep my eyes open as I finished the job. I drove through several streets, crossing pristine avenues and perfectly symmetrical squares. The smell of rain mingled with the fresh aroma of flowers that seemed to grow in every garden. But the absence of churches continued to nag at me. Was it just exhaustion? Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me...

After unloading everything, I returned to the station. The officer greeted me with the same neutral expression as before, but there was something different in his tone now.  
‚Äî We didn‚Äôt find anyone. ‚Äî The words came quickly, as if he wanted to end the conversation then and there.

‚Äî What do you mean? ‚Äî I asked, almost in disbelief. ‚Äî There was a dead girl! She was murdered!

The officer sighed, crossing his arms over his hefty belly.  
‚Äî Son, we sent a patrol, searched everywhere. We found nothing. No body, no sign of blood. Maybe you got confused.

The air in the station grew stifling. The smell of stale coffee mixed with the damp leather of my jacket felt stronger. I stared at the officer, trying to figure out if he was messing with me. But his face showed nothing but indifference.

Outside, the rain had stopped, but the sound of the cornfield seemed to echo, even from miles away. The city‚Äôs silence was almost supernatural, broken only by the wet boots of officers pacing back and forth. I knew what I had seen. I knew that girl had been there, that someone had hurt her.

‚Äî There was nothing. Not a drop of blood, ‚Äî the officer said, his tone dry and sharp. ‚Äî Maybe it was a wild animal you hit, and you mistook it for a girl.

‚Äî It was a girl! I‚Äôm sure of it! ‚Äî I insisted, my voice rising louder than I intended.

The officer remained still, his heavy, judgmental gaze fixed on me.  
‚Äî We didn‚Äôt find anything, Mr. Jhonatan. You‚Äôd best get on your way. Here in Vale Verde, we don‚Äôt like outsiders causing trouble.

There was an uncomfortable pause before he added:  
‚Äî I‚Äôm sure you understand, especially drunken types like yourself. The stench of booze is reaching me from here.

I froze for a moment, feeling the weight of his words. Then, without another word, I left. I got into my truck, furious at the officer and at everything that seemed wrong with that town. It was nearly morning‚Äîprobably around five o‚Äôclock.

The road was wet, but the rain had stopped, and the sky was beginning to brighten with the first rays of sunlight. As I drove, my mind replayed every detail.¬† The word the officer had said lingered in my mind. Something about him deeply unsettled me. Why had he asked if anyone would miss me? At the time, the adrenaline had kept me from processing it, but now, calmer, it seemed... sinister. And why did he want to know if I was baptized? The more I thought about it, the stranger it all seemed.

The wind began to pick up, and the endless rows of corn whispered constantly, almost like murmurs. There was something unnerving about that sound, as if the field had a life of its own, an unseen presence watching me. The damp smell of the earth mixed with the fresh scent of rain-soaked plants, creating an oppressive and uncomfortable atmosphere.

Then I passed the spot where I had found the little girl. I slowed down and looked more closely. My heart pounded. There it was‚Äîa massive, dark bloodstain, splattered across the asphalt. It was impossible to miss. My stomach turned as I noticed something even more disturbing: drag marks leading from the road into the cornfield.

She had been taken back there.

I stepped out of the truck, the cold morning air biting at my skin. The road was silent, except for the sinister rustling of the corn leaves, which seemed to mock me. I approached the edge of the cornfield, where the blood trails disappeared among the tall, dense stalks. A strong, metallic scent of blood hung in the air, mingling with the sweet, sickly smell of ripened corn.

I hesitated before stepping into the field, but something inside me screamed to stop. The sensation of being watched was almost tangible, as if hundreds of unseen eyes were staring at me through the stalks. The shadows of the cornfield seemed darker than they should have been at that hour, even with the sun rising.

Suddenly, the wind picked up, tossing the plants wildly in every direction. The sound was deafening, like a chorus of whispers spreading around me. My feet felt glued to the ground, but my instincts finally took over. I ran back to the truck, stumbling over my own legs, my breath quick and my heart pounding like a drum.

Once inside the cab, slamming the door shut, I felt momentarily safe. I glanced in the rearview mirror; the cornfield seemed still again, but I knew... something was there. Something that didn‚Äôt want to be seen.

As I sped down the road, one question hammered in my mind:

She talks about her personal training workouts, her younger siblings, and her career. Her birthday is this week but she works late (past 9pm).

I finished my drink and placed the glass on the counter with more force than I intended.  
‚Äî Maybe so, but I‚Äôve made up my mind. I‚Äôm going anyway.

Pituca sighed, lowering his head, as if giving up on trying to convince me.  
‚Äî May God protect you, Jhonatan.

I placed some bills on the counter and walked toward the door.  
‚Äî See you around, Pituca. Don‚Äôt worry so much.

Pituca watched the door close with a creak, the sound echoing in the empty bar. He kept his eyes on the entrance as he murmured to himself:  
‚Äî May God go with you...

I climbed into my truck, that iron giant, a 1978 model that was my home on wheels. The smell of diesel oil and worn leather filled the cabin‚Äîa familiar, comforting scent that always accompanied me on the road.

I turned on the battery-powered radio I charged at gas stations, and the heavy sound of AC/DC began to play. ‚ÄúHighway to Hell‚Äù was the perfect soundtrack for the dusk unfolding before me. The clock read close to six in the evening, and the sun was setting on the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and red, as if it were drowning in a sea of fire.

Driving along the highway, my hands gripped the wheel firmly, feeling the vibration of the engine beneath me. The wind blew through the slightly open window, carrying the scent of damp earth and trees lining the road. It was a mix of freedom and loneliness that only life on the road could offer.

Cars passed by, and other trucks crossed my path, with drivers waving or flashing their lights in greeting. I returned the gesture with a brief wave, keeping my eyes on the road. The radio continued playing as I headed toward Vale Verde.

It took me about one or two hours to get near the place. It was a long trip, but I was used to the solitude and silence of the road, interrupted only by the electric guitars of AC/DC. It was 1979, and I was one of the few who had the luxury of a portable TV in my truck. I loved watching movies when parked at rest stops‚Äîa way to escape the monotonous routine.

As the sun disappeared below the horizon, the sky began to change. Dense clouds formed, painting the evening in shades of gray. The wind picked up, carrying the smell of rain that soon started to sprinkle on the windshield‚Äîtiny drops illuminated by the headlights.

Night fell, and the weather worsened. Lightning streaked across the sky like blades, illuminating the cornfield that appeared alongside the road. It was as if the heavens were at war with themselves.

An endless stretch of corn began to appear‚Äîtall green walls extending for miles. My boss had mentioned this, saying Vale Verde was famous for its cornfields and known as one of the greenest towns in the country. He also claimed that nearly all the residents were wealthy, owners of the sprawling fields.

I found it hard to believe. Brazil was a land of inequalities, and thinking an entire town could be wealthy sounded like one of those exaggerated trucker tales. Maybe just idle chatter. Either way, the landscape was both impressive and oppressive, with that sea of corn hemming in the road.

The rain thickened, falling heavy and relentless. The windshield wipers worked hard, leaving wet trails on the glass as the headlights seemed to dissolve in the curtain of water. The sound of AC/DC still played faintly, mixed with the pattering rain and distant thunderclaps.

Then I saw it.

A figure emerged from the cornfield by the roadside.

I slammed the brakes hard, the truck skidding several meters before coming to a stop. The sound of the tires screeching on the wet pavement echoed through the night.

¬† I jumped out of the truck, my heart racing as if trying to burst out of my chest. The rain was pouring down in torrents, soaking my clothes within seconds. The headlights illuminated a girl stumbling out of the cornfield.

She was covered in blood.

‚Äî Are you okay? ‚Äî I shouted, running toward her. My voice felt small against the roar of the rain and thunder.

She didn‚Äôt respond. Her eyes were wide, her face pale, almost gray. Blood trickled from a cut on her forehead, mixing with the rain. She looked lost, her hair plastered to her face and her clothes torn.

‚Äî Hey, talk to me! ‚Äî I insisted, carefully grabbing her shoulders. I could feel her body trembling under my hands.

She mumbled something, but it was impossible to understand over the noise around us. The only thing I could grasp was the metallic scent of blood mingling with the sweet, earthy smell of corn that seemed to permeate the air around us.

‚Äî What happened? ‚Äî I asked, trying to drown out the storm‚Äôs noise.

She lifted her eyes to meet mine, filled with terror, and whispered something that chilled me to the bone:  
‚Äî They‚Äôre coming.

‚Äî Who? Who‚Äôs coming?

She started crying, her sobs muffled by the roaring wind. I pointed toward the truck.  
‚Äî Come on, I‚Äôll get you out of here. Move!

The girl hesitated, glancing back at the cornfield. She looked emaciated, and beneath the torn clothes, her skin bore bruises and scars. My stomach turned as I noticed the raw, exposed flesh where one of her hands should have been.

The shock made me pause. Thoughts raced through my mind‚Äîa lunatic in Vale Verde, a pedophile who had assaulted her and mutilated her. What if he was watching me now, hidden in the cornfield, observing my every move?

My blood froze. Pituca‚Äôs words came flooding back: ‚ÄúVale Verde is evil.‚Äù The place felt cursed, and though the rain had lightened, it still fell heavily, as if trying to bury everything beneath its weight.

Even without the wind, the rustling of the cornfield‚Äôs leaves grew louder, mingling with the sound of the raindrops hitting them. I glanced at the endless rows of corn, and the noise seemed to take on a life of its own. A chill ran down my spine, and the feeling of being watched became unbearable.

I ran back to the truck, my hands still smeared with the girl‚Äôs blood. I was drenched, but that was the least of my worries. I thought about returning to the bar, but it was too far. With no other choice, I continued down the road toward Vale Verde, leaving the girl‚Äôs body by the cornfield‚Äôs edge.

As I walked, surrounded by the endless rows of corn, a distant light appeared on the horizon. It was the town. A small sense of relief surfaced in the midst of the darkness.

Crossing into Vale Verde, I was met with an almost surreal sight: the town seemed untouched by the poverty I knew so well. Grand houses, luxurious mansions, and elegant buildings lined the streets‚Äînot a single structure could be described as humble. Even the smaller homes looked like they belonged in a European architecture magazine.

The rain still fell, cascading off the pristine roofs and paving the streets with an almost supernatural glow.

I reached the police station. Inside, a bald officer with white hair and a protruding belly looked at me over his glasses.  
‚Äî How can I help you, young man? ‚Äî he asked in a deep, disinterested voice.

‚Äî I found a girl by the side of the road, ‚Äî I said hesitantly.

He frowned.  
‚Äî You‚Äôre not from around here, are you, friend?

‚Äî I‚Äôm a trucker. I saw her on the road... Abused and missing a hand.

The officer sighed, as if he‚Äôd heard stories like this before.  
‚Äî Probably some wild animal.

Wild animal? I thought, confused. It would have to be a massive creature to do all that. But the way he said it so nonchalantly unnerved me.

The wet leather of my jacket, mixed with the iron scent of dried blood, was starting to make me nauseous. The station was cold and smelled of old paper and stale coffee. Outside, the sound of rain mingled with the distant rustling of the cornfield, its presence lingering like an unshakable shadow.

¬†‚Äî What‚Äôs your name, friend? ‚Äî the officer asked casually, though his tone hinted at something more.

‚Äî Jhonatan Rodrigues.

‚Äî How old are you?

‚Äî I‚Äôm 20.

‚Äî And kids? Anyone who‚Äôd miss you?

The question caught me off guard.  
‚Äî Yeah... I have a wife and two kids. But why do you ask?

The officer gave a quick, almost awkward smile.  
‚Äî Nothing, nothing. Just part of the job. You know, gathering a bit of info here and there. Are you Christian, friend?

‚Äî I am. My whole family‚Äôs been baptized.

‚Äî Ah, good... ‚Äî He paused, wiping his forehead as if deep in thought. ‚Äî You‚Äôre here to deliver to the mayor, right?

‚Äî I think so.

‚Äî Alright, I‚Äôll take care of your case. As soon as you unload the delivery, I‚Äôll send a patrol to look for the girl.

‚Äî Alright.

I left the station with a strange feeling in my chest. I got into my truck and drove the load to the agreed location. As I navigated through Vale Verde‚Äôs streets, something deeply unsettled me. The city was luxurious, but it felt incomplete. There wasn‚Äôt a single church.

That struck me. Anywhere else in the country, it‚Äôs normal to see churches on every corner, next to bars or supermarkets. There‚Äôs always a cross marking the horizon of any small town. But here? Nothing.

I decided to keep my eyes open as I finished the job. I drove through several streets, crossing pristine avenues and perfectly symmetrical squares. The smell of rain mingled with the fresh aroma of flowers that seemed to grow in every garden. But the absence of churches continued to nag at me. Was it just exhaustion? Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me...

After unloading everything, I returned to the station. The officer greeted me with the same neutral expression as before, but there was something different in his tone now.  
‚Äî We didn‚Äôt find anyone. ‚Äî The words came quickly, as if he wanted to end the conversation then and there.

‚Äî What do you mean? ‚Äî I asked, almost in disbelief. ‚Äî There was a dead girl! She was murdered!

The officer sighed, crossing his arms over his hefty belly.  
‚Äî Son, we sent a patrol, searched everywhere. We found nothing. No body, no sign of blood. Maybe you got confused.

The air in the station grew stifling. The smell of stale coffee mixed with the damp leather of my jacket felt stronger. I stared at the officer, trying to figure out if he was messing with me. But his face showed nothing but indifference.

Outside, the rain had stopped, but the sound of the cornfield seemed to echo, even from miles away. The city‚Äôs silence was almost supernatural, broken only by the wet boots of officers pacing back and forth. I knew what I had seen. I knew that girl had been there, that someone had hurt her.

‚Äî There was nothing. Not a drop of blood, ‚Äî the officer said, his tone dry and sharp. ‚Äî Maybe it was a wild animal you hit, and you mistook it for a girl.

‚Äî It was a girl! I‚Äôm sure of it! ‚Äî I insisted, my voice rising louder than I intended.

The officer remained still, his heavy, judgmental gaze fixed on me.  
‚Äî We didn‚Äôt find anything, Mr. Jhonatan. You‚Äôd best get on your way. Here in Vale Verde, we don‚Äôt like outsiders causing trouble.

There was an uncomfortable pause before he added:  
‚Äî I‚Äôm sure you understand, especially drunken types like yourself. The stench of booze is reaching me from here.

I froze for a moment, feeling the weight of his words. Then, without another word, I left. I got into my truck, furious at the officer and at everything that seemed wrong with that town. It was nearly morning‚Äîprobably around five o‚Äôclock.

The road was wet, but the rain had stopped, and the sky was beginning to brighten with the first rays of sunlight. As I drove, my mind replayed every detail.¬† The word the officer had said lingered in my mind. Something about him deeply unsettled me. Why had he asked if anyone would miss me? At the time, the adrenaline had kept me from processing it, but now, calmer, it seemed... sinister. And why did he want to know if I was baptized? The more I thought about it, the stranger it all seemed.

The wind began to pick up, and the endless rows of corn whispered constantly, almost like murmurs. There was something unnerving about that sound, as if the field had a life of its own, an unseen presence watching me. The damp smell of the earth mixed with the fresh scent of rain-soaked plants, creating an oppressive and uncomfortable atmosphere.

Then I passed the spot where I had found the little girl. I slowed down and looked more closely. My heart pounded. There it was‚Äîa massive, dark bloodstain, splattered across the asphalt. It was impossible to miss. My stomach turned as I noticed something even more disturbing: drag marks leading from the road into the cornfield.

She had been taken back there.

I stepped out of the truck, the cold morning air biting at my skin. The road was silent, except for the sinister rustling of the corn leaves, which seemed to mock me. I approached the edge of the cornfield, where the blood trails disappeared among the tall, dense stalks. A strong, metallic scent of blood hung in the air, mingling with the sweet, sickly smell of ripened corn.

I hesitated before stepping into the field, but something inside me screamed to stop. The sensation of being watched was almost tangible, as if hundreds of unseen eyes were staring at me through the stalks. The shadows of the cornfield seemed darker than they should have been at that hour, even with the sun rising.

Suddenly, the wind picked up, tossing the plants wildly in every direction. The sound was deafening, like a chorus of whispers spreading around me. My feet felt glued to the ground, but my instincts finally took over. I ran back to the truck, stumbling over my own legs, my breath quick and my heart pounding like a drum.

Once inside the cab, slamming the door shut, I felt momentarily safe. I glanced in the rearview mirror; the cornfield seemed still again, but I knew... something was there. Something that didn‚Äôt want to be seen.

As I sped down the road, one question hammered in my mind:

This story isn‚Äôt the straw that broke the camels back but it definitely made me finally start to consider a career change. 

I had a MB accuse me of stealing her husband‚Äôs sunglasses‚Ä¶but not outright. The conversation went like this: 


Me: *walks into work with sunglasses on my head like I do every morning*


MB: *stares angrily at said sunglasses* Nice sunglasses! 


Me: Thanks! They‚Äôre my favorite *confused at the angry stare* 


MB: My husband lost a pair exactly like that a few weeks ago 


Me: Oh? Around the house? I can help look for them! 


MB: We‚Äôre not sure. But they look exactly like the ones on your head. 



Me: *pulls them off head to show her the major scratches on the lenses from 4 years of constant use* Exactly like these? Are they beat up like mine?



MB: They weren‚Äôt when he lost them‚Ä¶. *still staring at me angrily* 



Me: Oh‚Ä¶ok. Well I‚Äôll keep an eye out!! 


MB: I‚Äôll tell DB you have a pair of sunglasses exactly like his. How bizarre! When did you say you got them again? 


Me: I didn‚Äôt. But about 4 years ago, I wear them daily. They‚Äôre great sunglasses I‚Äôm sure DB is definitely missing his! 


MB: He may just steal them back! 



Me: ummmm what? *laughs nervously* he doesn‚Äôt want these beat up old things! 


MB: *Scoffs and storms off* 


UMMMMM. The audacity!? They were an old wire style of Rayban sunglasses. The family was very well off so I‚Äôm sure DB had a newer, nicer version. Mine were seriously beat to hell, a friend ran over them with their truck and I had to bend them back into place but I LOVED those things. Wore them every day and came in with them on my head every morning and sat them on the counter next to my coffee mug and keys every day from the very beginning. I was sooooo shocked that she accused me of stealing them but in her passive aggressive way she always communicated with me.  To this day I wonder if he ever found his sunglasses and if his wife ever felt like an ass for the way she treated me. I made sure to wear them on my head every chance I got around her just to prove I had nothing to hide. I actually quit a week later when they got crazy mad (had the grandma I never met call to berate me?) because I couldn‚Äôt accommodate a last minute schedule change. That family left such a bad taste in my mouth I never went back to nannying, just found a new career.

1i70ulv,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeerotation/comments/1i70ulv/rotation_2_dak_is_live/,ROTATION #2 DAK is live,"Hello all,

I'm trying this again after the first run yesterday. Here's the update for [ROTATION #2 DAK LIVE:](https://coffeerotation.com/products/rotation-2)

v2 Update:

Bean Dosing:

* Workflow speed has improved, reducing from 10 minutes to 6 minutes for dosing and bagging approximately 250 grams of beans.
* Emphasis on cleanliness with a clean workspace and wearing gloves to avoid cross-contamination of flavors.
* Using a K-ultra grinder rubber air blower to clean the Orion nano doser, especially since Dak beans produce a lot of skin particles, which can take 3-4 minutes to clear.
* The Orion nano doser is accurate to within 0.2 - 0.1 grams; I manually adjust by adding one bean to get closer to 15 grams, allowing for three additional servings per box.

Packaging:

* Miscalculated bean quantities initially, which complicated order fulfillment by necessitating alternative beans for 2-3 orders.
* Adopting a ""random"" approach where the specific bean isn't listed online but is detailed on the bag.
* Label system streamlined via Google Sheets for auto-filling information, though current labels (2.25 x 1.25 inches) are too small for clear reading. Larger 3x2 inch labels are on order.
* QR code functionality changed; now directs to the main website due to configuration issues.
* Custom boxes were a mistake; arriving in two weeks, but currently using black mailers. The boxes are smaller than ideal (7x6x1 inch), should've been taller. maybe 3 inches not 1inch.

https://reddit.com/link/1i70ulv/video/gn6h120zkgee1/player

Current Problems:

* The backend of the store is undergoing rapid changes. Transitioning to a headless setup for more flexibility, but currently, it's just a basic site.
* Shipping Label Issue: Shopify integration for labels isn't working; had to use Pirate Ship for syncing orders and label creation. Encountered issues this morning, but managed to ship orders with a workaround.
* Store Compliance: My store was flagged for potential fraud, requiring additional paperwork, setting a pricing structure, and prohibiting $0 sales, which seems odd.

Cost:

Investing in a doser ($900) and label machine ($150) was costly. Manual labor would be cheaper but too time consuming. I can only dedicate 30 minutes to an hour of my brain to this.

Handwriting labels would be inefficient as this is 100+ at a time./label maker/printer was a must.

Bean Pricing:

* Beans cost roughly $3 per 20 grams (e.g., DAK at $31/200 grams or 13 servings or 64$/pound), making each baggie sold at a $9 ""loss.""
* Seeking sustainable solutions, I've contacted multiple places for wholesale pricing but received little response.

Reflections:

This project is fun but might not be sustainable long-term. If it stops being enjoyable, I'll reconsider continuing.

My idea is slowly growing into something bigger, its nice, but its also not fun. Ordering coffee is the easy part, bagging, packing, getting charged 3% on shopify, paying for shipping, spending money on redoing labels, its all how a person dies from 1000 papercuts. It's just funny how I'm getting dms about shipping cost when I'm doing all of this work and they want shit for free. They want FREE coffee, FREEE shipping, FREE everything. Definitely not sustainable, but I would like a way to make this a self sustaining thing so that people can enjoy and try coffee without the risk of spending on a full bag. There's something here, but just need to work through it so that the solution presents itself. I'm not sure what I got myself into...

I'm not a big fan of those subscription wholesalers, but that might be a way to facilitate that through this so that its self sustained. If you like XYZ sample, you place order, and rotation gets some type of affiliate sale. There are a lot of ideas floating around, but we'll  just have to wait and see how it all ends.",6,1737513944.0,coffeerotation,8,0.87,False

I asked my old therapist to call me and I talked with her as well. She said it went really well and that she got a good feel for my therapist and that she believes I‚Äôm in good hands.

She said I want you to know that you have made such an impact on my life as well. She said you have helped me change the way I do therapy and I will never ever forget you. She said she loved my honestly and authenticity. I told her that it wasn‚Äôt just that she created a safe place but that most importantly it was her person that I valued so much. She thanked me and said I thank you and appreciate you for being you.

I cried through most of it. I said I know we‚Äôre not friends but 14 years feels so hard to just say good bye and while I understand that‚Äôs the therapeutic process it feels so wrong. She said she knows it‚Äôs really hard. I know she will never just disappear from my life and her telling me she would reach out if anything ever changes lets me know that, ugh, I‚Äôm crying just writing this. This stuff is so hard when you had such a great connection with a therapist for so long. I wish I could just go grab a coffee with her in 5 years and catch up.on life. We set up our 6 month final visit. Maybe time will help but man I love her, she was like a mom in a way even if it was only in the confines of her office. 

The reason we had to do this was to help me in the work with my new therapist who is amazing as well. and I really look forward to us getting to know each other as we work together. I hope we connect in the same way, I feel it starting. I‚Äôm such a relational person and that‚Äôs what I need in the whole process. I had no idea how healing that part would be like it had with my long term therapist. 

But I am and will grieve a lot‚Ä¶‚Ä¶this parts super hard‚Ä¶.nothing totally prepares you for this‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt have a lot of time to craft this post, but I don‚Äôt have time for editing and whatnot.  On paternal leave and parenting around the clock so I do have time for short replies to clarify. Okay that being said:

My wife hace been together a little over a year (mid thirties) we weren‚Äôt being careful, but we ARE solidly in love and rapidly moving beyond child rearing age, we used to joke about rolling the dice. Needless to say we conceived my child and I proposed to my wife. Things were expedited but I had lived several lives before I started my military career in my early thirties. 
My wife has endured a lot of trauma in childhood and has some very strong unmedicated anxiety. It shows up through her snapping at me or saying unkind things to my when she is spiraling. This is troubling to me because I used to be an absolute hot head and part of my maturing was learning to be overly nice (in a genuine way) so I do end up in a situation where I get overly pissed off and do or say something stupid or over the top. I don‚Äôt want to make it seem like I‚Äôm a complete ass but I‚Äôve blown my top as recently as my early twenties and my skin still crawls thinking of me loosing my shit. All that being said I put a lot of value in how I treat people and over time acts of service has become a core love language for me. Okay great that‚Äôs the backstory.
So we are super new parents and it‚Äôs tough but expected. Another thing that is to be expected is for my wife to have extreme emotions with her already heightened anxiety etc alongside the rollercoster of hormones she‚Äôs dealing with. I promise I get that and respect that. Today I‚Äôm trying to do our new routine as usual. Since we married and I moved in I have done all the cleaning (because I didn‚Äôt want her interacting with chemicals) cooking( because I‚Äôm more efficient and have experience as a professional cook) and generally waited on my wife (as I know I should in this crucial time) . *I know that sentence was fucked but stay with me aye*
So this morning I‚Äôm starting the coffee, the breakfast, and her matcha and she gets on this kick about the baby wrap/carriers she just got. I think cool I‚Äôll try it on while I make breakfast, and she makes a big deal about cooking while holding baby, cool, I‚Äôm all about safety. So she takes over I‚Äôm ‚Äúwearing baby‚Äù and she starts yelling at me about not being able to find this electric whisk that I never use to make her tea and in a anxiety fueled spiral knocks over an entire spice rack while looking for the thing, blaming me all the while. I lost my shit admittedly. I said she was making the newborn stage harder than it had to be, I said she over extends herself which causes me to have to do the same jobs I intended to do only after the time I intended to do them in, and after tears and maybe an argument. I told her this is temporary, and within 6 weeks the baby will be far more independent of her. I didn‚Äôt bring it up, but I feel terrible because I had thoughts of how she is making this about her when the focus in my perspective should be on the child. I should add that in our short marriage her flipping on me in a similar fashion when she‚Äôs in a medium to high pressure situation. I try to be understanding but how can I do this my whole life? Am I the asshole, I can‚Äôt lie I sure fucking feel like it.",3,1737513825.0,AITAH,28,0.62,False

1i70mt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1i70mt2/the_waffle_house_at_the_edge_of_the_woods/,The Waffle House at the Edge of the Woods,"Waffle House, an icon of American midwestern and southern culture. Often, it‚Äôs yellow glow is a beacon of hope to those late night dwellers, whether they be members of the working class or alcohol favoring partiers. Druggos are also a staple clientele. Waffle House, for better or worse, opens its doors to everyone from every walk of life. 

I will set the scene: it‚Äôs a late Thursday night, or early Friday morning in technicality, and I was heading home from a late night bender where I had the important but ultimately boring job of designated driver. All I wanted to do was go home and crack open a cold one for myself to kick off my weekend. Nature had other plans, however. The weather in the midsouth turned on a dime, and tonight was no exception. A downpour diminished any visibility on the road, and I knew I couldn‚Äôt confidently drive through this. The familiar yellow glow shone through the onslaught of rain and hail, however, and given that Waffle House will probably remain open under threat of nuclear war, I knew I could seek refuge there. 

The jingling bells welcomed me more than any employee did, but I could not blame them. The restaurant was a mess, probably from a busy evening earlier. The rodeo was this weekend, after all, and those rodeo boys sure loved their Waffle House. Shit, we all did. It was a Waffle Home in this part of town-- it was all we had after the rest of the town went to bed at sundown. 

A waitress sighs and tells me to sit wherever I‚Äôd like and she‚Äôd get to me when she could. She looked so tired. I picked the one somewhat clean table in the place, and watched the storm rage on outside. My phone confirmed that I would be here for awhile, and all I could do at this point was hope it didn‚Äôt evolve into a tornado. Waffle House would probably remain open even if it did. 

Even this late into the night, Waffle House had a buzz of conversation and kitchen noises. I saw a full staff and other customers, and yet, the only sound in the place was the hail beating on the roof and windows. The usual late night sound of laughter or arguments (usually the latter) was replaced by this frighteningly eerie silence. 

Seeing my phone was nearing the end of its battery life, I glanced around for an outlet when my eyes met those of the man in the booth across me. His hunched shoulders were cloaked in a dirty plaid shirt, and I assumed he might have been one of the rodeo boys. He wasn‚Äôt terribly old, maybe in his fifties at most, but the weariness of his features aged him. He stared at me momentarily, a slight crustiness to his gaze, before he returned to his plate of syrup soaked waffles. 

I slid down a little in my booth, knowing I‚Äôd soon be phoneless. Well, not the end of the world, I figured. People operated just fine without phones for years. I set it aside and waited for my waitress to remember I was here. 

The lights above flickered, and yet were silent-- none of that fluorescent hum. Or maybe there was, and I just couldn‚Äôt hear it among the thunder and hail. It still struck me as unsettling, but my thoughts were interrupted by the work worn face of Marilyn. 

‚ÄúWhat can I get you?,‚Äù she asked in a monotone voice that added to my increasing unease. She didn‚Äôt sound tired, or annoyed, she sounded utterly blank. Almost robotic, but with an inflection of human that made it uncanny.

‚ÄúCould I get a coffee, and the two egg breakfast with--‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt get to specify anything about my plate before she was walking away. Must have been a hell of a shift, I thought to myself. Whatever, food was food, I would be fine with whatever I got at this point, as long as it passed the time faster. I just wanted to go home. 

Her shoes echoed as she shuffled off, and she didn‚Äôt speak with the cook, she just handed him a plate with random crap on it. Figuring my staring would be rude, I turned back to the window. Luckily, the hail stopped, but the rain was still coming down in buckets. No tornado watch yet. The atmosphere felt oppressively thick, and I almost felt like I was choking on the smells of burnt coffee, bacon, and stale cigarettes. There was an undertone to it though, something I couldn‚Äôt place right away. It was oddly‚Ä¶.metallic. 

I pressed the heels of my hand to my eyes and took a deep breath. I had to relax. It was just a fucking Waffle House. It was always weird-- that was part of the charm. My growing anxiety was just the storms, right? 

‚ÄúGood time for a late night meal, huh?‚Äù The voice made me jump from my seat. It was the rodeo guy, staring right at me. His voice was low and gravelly and much more human than the waitress‚Äôs, yet it gave me even more anxiety. Despite how I‚Äôd seen him actively eating, his plate had the same amount of food on it that I‚Äôd seen earlier. He had a little smirk on his face, and glanced at the window, as if suggesting I do the same. 

I smiled nervously, wondering why the fuck some random man was talking to me. I was a newer face around this part of the country, and what they called Southern Hospitality still creeped me the fuck out. As if noticing this, he let out a frightening little chuckle before returning to his plate of waffles, his weirdly hypnotic gaze now breaking. 

I looked back out the window, weirdly compelled to, and the rain had downgraded to less apocalyptic now. I could see my car, and a few bodies in the parking lot smoking. I had a bad habit of not locking my doors, so I locked them from my remote to deter any smokers out there who might be interested in my stunning little Nissan Altima that smoked if you drove it longer than twenty minutes. Lightning flashed, momentarily illuminating the parking lot. That‚Äôs when I noticed the shadows. They moved unnaturally, and danced only at the very edges of the parking lot.

My heart began to race, but like before, the waitress interrupted my growing unease. A cup of coffee was placed in front of me, its smell warm and familiar. And yet, it brought me no comfort. I tried to ask for sugar and cream, but again, the waitress walked away before I could. Black coffee was better than no coffee, I figured. Taking a sip eased my nerves a bit, and I told myself I was just letting my anxiety get out of hand. I was finding fright in things that were perfectly normal-- for a Waffle House. 

Aside myself and the rodeo boy, there was one other table here. Five people in total, who were silent the whole time. I only knew this because they stared at me as they walked by to leave. No words, no smiles, just vacant staring. I knew I stood out, but it made me feel uncomfortable regardless. 

Rodeo boy laughs once more. ‚ÄúSaw yer plates,‚Äù he said, motioning to the window. ‚ÄúOut of state. You‚Äôre new here, aren‚Äôt ya?‚Äù

‚ÄúBeen about six months,‚Äù I replied. Did that count as new? Ever since I moved here, people seemed obsessed with the idea of me being from out of town. It felt so unnecessary.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just a drop of piss in the bucket, son. I‚Äôm here every night, and I ain‚Äôt ever seen you.‚Äù He was right. I‚Äôd never been to this Waffle House before. I much more preferred the one on the highway, surrounded by other businesses. This one was more remote, which added to it‚Äôs uncomfortable atmosphere. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gonna stare, son. You‚Äôre out here dressed as Count Dracula, chokin‚Äô back black coffee. We don‚Äôt do cream ‚Äòn sugar, you‚Äôll just have to mature a bit.‚Äù

He laughed once more, but I decided not to reply. Why should I? He was a creepy, hulking man who was getting a kick out of scaring and insulting me. It felt safest to pretend he wasn‚Äôt there. 

My eyes go back to the window, and in another flash of lightning, I see them again. The shadows. It was as if fingers of darkness were clawing at the edges of the parking lot. I inched closer to the glass to get a better look, when the sound of a plate slamming once again pulls my attention away. My waitress. 

‚ÄúSyrup?,‚Äù she asked. 

It confused me, until I looked down and saw waffles. I hadn‚Äôt ordered that. ‚ÄúOh, this is--‚Äù

‚ÄúAll we got,‚Äù she snapped. ‚ÄúSyrup or not?‚Äù

I nervously shook my head and slumped in my seat some as she walked away. I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of waffles-- even Waffle House‚Äôs-- but hey, food was food. I took a bite, and again looked out the window. The sight made me nearly choke on my food. 

The man was laughing wholeheartedly now, as if my horror was the funniest thing he‚Äôd ever seen. The entire lot now was engulfed in the strange tendrils of shadow, and it was pulling at the hedges that perimetered the building. I got up quickly, getting as far from the window as I could in a short amount of time. 

My eyes looked to rodeo boy. ‚ÄúShut the fuck up dude-- don‚Äôt you see that!?‚Äù

‚ÄúSee what?,‚Äù he mocked. ‚ÄúOh, hush boy.‚Äù His laughing ceased and he pointed at the seat across his. ‚ÄúYour mind‚Äôs playing with ya, making ya see shit. Why don‚Äôt ya sit awhile and relax some?‚Äù

I shook my head and turned to the counter, trying to pay. But it was like the staff was ignoring me. 

‚ÄúAh, come on!,‚Äù the man teased. ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôd be a big fan of the creepy crawlies that hang out ‚Äòround here! C‚Äômon, sit with me, I can tell ya all about it.‚Äù

I still didn‚Äôt want to, and every instinct said not to, and yet, it was like he was forcing me to. I was stiff as a corpse as I sat down, and my eyes refused to meet his. They were quite suddenly full of life, like a proud predator who had just caught his prey. 

‚ÄúThey say these woods are haunted,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool‚Ä¶‚Äù I murmured, looking for any out to leave.

‚ÄúThe shadows yer seeing, they ain‚Äôt real. The trees pull weird tricks out here. No, no, see the real worries in this neck of the woods ain‚Äôt no ghosties. There‚Äôs weird people.‚Äù

No shit. I‚Äôm sitting with one.

He then says something that injected ice into my veins. ‚ÄúYanno, you‚Äôd make a fine lookin‚Äô corpse, Hollywood.‚Äù

There was an instinct to correct him, wanting to say that just because I was from California didn‚Äôt mean I was from Hollywood. I‚Äôd never even been to fucking Hollywood. But fear took over, and I tried to inch out of my seat.

‚ÄúNot a lot of meat on ya, though. But I bet you‚Äôre one of them clean eaters, all that plant based shit. I bet that‚Äôs like a good, grass fed beef. Ya dig?‚Äù

I dug, alright. I once again tried to leave, but now, his hand had a frighteningly strong grip on my own. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt go out there right now if I was you. Like I said, they say these woods are haunted. They say they make people do crazy things. There‚Äôs a few families in them there woods, families I won‚Äôt ever speak to. They like to wait for the dark--‚Äù His voice immediately stopped with the tingling of bells. A new face had just walked in.

He was a tall, thin, utterly filthy man. I would guess that he was a farmer based on his clothing, but it was almost as if he was dressed in a costume to trick people like me who weren‚Äôt raised around here.

Rodeo boy in front of me now leaned in close. ‚ÄúThat there‚Äôs one of em,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúYou sit tight, pretty boy.‚Äù

I had a chance to escape then, as he‚Äôd gotten up to greet this freak. But that meant walking right by them, which I didn‚Äôt want to chance. This new comer had dead eyes, the kind with no soul in them. I turned away, quietly listening to rodeo boy talk him up. 

‚ÄúWell, shoot, Todd I ain‚Äôt seen ya in, shit, how long‚Äôs it been now?‚Äù Rodeo boy sounded genuinely friendly now. 

‚ÄúNot since our Brodie went missin‚Äô,‚Äù Todd replied. His voice was oddly deep for someone as scrawny as he was. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been ‚Äòbout six months.‚Äù

Todd glances my way, and I again feel ice in my blood. ‚ÄúYou looks a lot like my Brodie,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou wanna be Brodie?‚Äù

Rodeo boy, takes him by the shoulder and leads him to a table. ‚ÄúNow, Todd, that twig looks nothing like Brodie. You don‚Äôt want him.‚Äù

Want me? I got up now, knowing this may not end well. I tried to be inconspicuous as I went for the door, but Todd‚Äôs voice warned me not to. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt wanna go out there right now. Mama‚Äôs out, ‚Äòn she‚Äôs in one of her moods. She‚Äôs been real hungry, Mason. I dunno what to with her.‚Äù

Rodeo boy, aka Mason, told me to sit back down before turning back to Todd. ‚ÄúYou gotta ride it out. Yer family can‚Äôt keep doin‚Äô this.‚Äù His voice dropped to a hush. ‚ÄúOne of these days, someone‚Äôs gonna catch on. Get her a deer or somethin‚Äô, all these missin‚Äô boys is eventually gonna turn back to you.‚Äù

It was all clicking. Was this Mama some crazed murder? Was she blood thirsty? Or was it a more literal hunger? 

I didn‚Äôt want to stick around to find out. My car was less than twenty feet away. If I ran, I could get in it fast enough to beat it out of here. 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt try it!,‚Äù Mason called after me. But it was too late. I was dining and dashing sure, but I had to get the fuck out of here. Through the rain, I sprinted to my car, and practically dove inside. I prayed for it to start on the first try, for once in my life, and thank god it did. I ensured all my doors were locked before turning on the headlights. 

The sight before me made me scream. An older, larger woman was in front of my car. In my panic, I was struggling to shift into reverse, giving her a chance to hobble to my door. Through the glass, I could hear her wailing, ‚ÄúYou gotta light!? You gotta light for my cigarette!?‚Äù She was pounding on the window, begging for a light. 

I did not care. I threw the car into reverse and whipped the fuck out of there. I was going about ninety on the highway, wanting to put as much space between me and this Waffle House as possible. It was all a bad dream, I told myself, a manifestation of my anxiety. Seeing my apartment complex in my headlights felt like salvation, and I knew this was all behind me. Now, more than ever, I craved a Modelo. I took a moment in my car to just breathe. Everything was going to be alright, I assured myself. It was all fine. Mason was just scaring me for fun, Todd was obviously mentally ill, that woman was probably on drugs. It was just a weird night. I was letting my fear of storms make everything into a horror movie. 

Once I‚Äôd stopped shaking, I started for my apartment. Typically, I never paid attention to anything in the lobby, least of all the mess of papers that littered the billboard. There was usually all the same shit: local ads, lost pets, and missing people. The same things you‚Äôd see at a Walmart or a post office, or anywhere else. I‚Äôd seen it all so much that it melted into the background in my day to day life. 

But tonight, it caught my eye. A missing person‚Äôs flyer with a photo of a guy looking vaguely like myself. Brodie Wells, it read. Brodie. My heart sunk as I ripped it off and inspected it closer. Behind Brodie‚Äôs flyer was another, very similarly formatted. Another young guy, looking like an outsider. And another. And another. There were over twenty of them-- all within ten years of age from each other, all not dressing like the townsfolk I'd seen here, and all missing in this area. All last seen around that Waffle House by those woods. They were also all tourists, visitors-- just like myself. I brought all the flyers to my unit with me, laying them all over my floor to get a better look. This kidnapper definitely had a type. Or was it a kidnapper? 

I pulled open my laptop and started researching each name, and everything came back the same. No trace of any of them, and this had been going on for years. Two of them had an ounce more of information on them, as their names were better known. They had public profiles, so there was much more on their case. They were also tourists, but they looked different from the kidnappers' victim type. They were in town for some YouTube video project, and apparently, one recommended they film out the woods in the area after a dinner at Waffle House. For years, nothing ever came up about them, until a hiker‚Äôs dog came running out of the woods with a human bone. One that was so smooth, it was as if all flesh had been cooked away. Those were the article's exact words. Soon, another bone was found, and both were DNA matched to a pair of missing YouTubers named Hunter and Isaiah. But that was years ago, and they were never explicitly tied to other missing persons cases. Despite the differences, I found connections. Were these the first victims? Did they put up too much of a fight, perhaps? The one did look a little intimidating, like he didn't trust strangers. Maybe he'd fought back? My heart was pounding and my mind went back to Waffle House. 

Mama‚Äôs in one of her moods. What was the mood? Homicidal? Damn it, Mason, that‚Äôs not something to ride out! I decided to try and call the police, but my phone was dead at this point. Surely, there was a public phone in the lobby. I raced downstairs for it, but to my dismay, the line was dead. Had the storm taken it out? It had picked back up again, the thunder rattling the whole building as it sounded. The lights flickered before also going out, and now, it was pitch black. The only light came from the occasional flashes of lightning. 

That‚Äôs how I saw her, standing in that glass doorway. As shadows unnaturally danced about in the same way they did in that parking lot, I saw her silhouette and a glimpse of her face, but there was no mistaking it. It was the same woman, and my only saving grace was the door being locked from the inside. She was pounding on the glass once more, begging to be let in. 

‚ÄúCome on, now, boy, you can spare a light!,‚Äù she begged, somehow yelling loud enough that I could hear her clearly through the glass. Her fist was pounding on it in a jarring display of strength, sending echoing booms through the quiet lobby. I couldn't see a thing in the dark to find where I was going, and I stood frozen in fear. I was hoping the lock would hold and that the rain soaking her would make her give up. 

A million things ran through my mind. Mason really was a freak, but he was trying to be nice, wasn't he? Was he trying to save me? He seemed to know, and yet, he seemed to have a soft spot for Todd. Was Todd an unwilling accomplice? Were Mason's comments nothing more than to get me to either leave sooner, or pay attention to him? It seemed Marilyn, my waitress, was trying to keep me distracted too. Did they not want me to look out the window? Was that how this Mama spotted me? I lived my life in near constant fear of everyone around me that I missed those who maybe had good intentions at heart. How I regretted that now. 

All at once her pounding stopped, and I thought for sure she was done. But she suddenly pressed her face to the glass, and a long flash of lightning illuminated her unholy grin. She's not human, I thought to myself. She couldn't be. 

‚ÄúYou'd make a lovely corpse!,‚Äù she yelled, and it sent chills through me. 

It wasn't just because of those harrowing words. It was because I could hear her much clearer now. The door was open, the glass shattered around her frail, twitching frame. Her skin hung on her like kudzu hangs on an abandoned home, and her teeth were unnaturally large and white as she grinned maniacally. I was frozen before the sound of shuffling glass against the bottom of her slippers pushed me into action. Her eyes shone like a predator‚Äôs, and I had to act to live. 

All I could do now was run.

It's all I have been reading on Reddit over the last 6 months and got tired of it.**

Me: I completely understand why you feel that way. We have been shilling Kendu non stop over the past few months. But trust me this is not just another update- a transformation has unfolded in Kendu, one that I believe is a game-changer, not just for Kendu but for the entire memecoin space.

**You: Okay. So what is the latest buzz about Kendu?**  
Me: Kendu just had its ‚Äúphoenix moment.‚Äù It‚Äôs risen from the ashes of developer drama, betrayal and is now 100% community-driven. Finally after months of chaos and challenges, the community has taken full control

**You: Wait, Chaos, Drama? Betrayal? What happened?!**  
Me: Picture this: for months, the Kendu community is working tirelessly, pouring their hearts and souls into building something extraordinary. But there was one little problem: the dev. Yes, the dev‚Äîthe person who was supposed to lead the charge‚Äîdecided to moonwalk in the opposite direction. Sabotage? Check. Ignoring community desires? Double-check. Trying to bury Kendu six feet under? Triple-check¬†*(The reason Kendu market cap was going down over the past few months)*. But guess what? The dev underestimated the power of the community. Spoiler alert: the community won.

*Basically we had our Batman moment. Dev is Ra al Ghul and Kendu community is Batman :)*

**You: How did the community manage to pull this off and what happened to Dev?**  
Me: With sheer determination, some serious grit, and probably a lot of Kendu energy drinks, the community rallied together, took control, and staged a takeover that would be worth of a Netflix documentary. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but the got the dev to send back the remaining tokens to the donations wallet. Translation? The dev is out, the community is in, and those tokens are now ammunition for listings, marketing, and spreading the Kendu gospel.

**You: That sounds intense. What‚Äôs next for Kendu?**  
Me: Oh, just a clean slate, a fresh start, and a chance to rewrite history. No big deal. The community is embracing a decentralized, transparent, and adaptable approach. Imagine a Kendu that‚Äôs not tied to any one person but is instead a movement fueled by belief and true conviction.

**You: Has this brought back old supporters and how is crypto world reacting to this?**  
Me: Absolutely. It‚Äôs like a reunion. Hundreds of old faces have returned to the Telegram group. And the whales who had been waiting on the sidelines and everyone is ready to push Kendu to new heights. And the result -*you can see for yourself*

**You: I understand that Kendu is turning a new chapter, But what makes Kendu different from other memecoins?**  
Me: Where do I even start? For starters, Kendu is the second memecoin ever to complete a Certik audit organically besides Pepe. It‚Äôs also the second to have its own Stocktwits page and has been featured in top-tier CEX campaigns and advertisements (Coinbase). Add to that a thriving community with real-world products (energy drinks, coffee, jewellery etc), members rocking Kendu tattoos, and one of the healthiest token distributions in DeFi. Oh, and did I mention the SOL wormhole? Yes, Kendu is available both on ETH and SOL

**You: What‚Äôs the ultimate goal for Kendu?**  
Me: Billions, baby. The community took it to a $280M market cap in 2024 in bear market , and now with 17,000 holders, there is no limit to where Kendu can go. we‚Äôve proven that the Kendu movement is unstoppable, a once-in-a-cycle opportunity that‚Äôs here to dominate. It‚Äôs not just a memecoin; it‚Äôs a genuine brand, a movement, and‚Äîdare I say it‚Äîa way of life.

**You: Is it too late to get involved?**  
Me: Not at all. In fact, now is the perfect time. If you‚Äôve been sitting on the sidelines, now‚Äôs the time to jump in. The community has weathered its biggest storm and come out stronger than ever. There‚Äôs nothing stopping them now. As they say, fortune favors the bold‚Äîor in this case, the Kendu believers. So, are you ready to ride this rocket to the moon?

1i70fbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i70fbd/struggling_with_insecurity_in_friendships/,Struggling with insecurity in friendships,"Sorry for the title, which might seem clickbaity‚Äîwell, it is a little, to be honest. I‚Äôve been dealing with something for a while, and I‚Äôd like to find the tools to bring myself some psychological peace. It‚Äôs nothing serious, but it weighs on me a bit.  
I‚Äôm surrounded by friends who never check in, who almost never write to me. It might sound strange to put it that way, but all my friends are like this. I see them whenever I can, we have amazing times together, we really know each other well. I have several friend groups, and when I say none of them ever write, I‚Äôm exaggerating. Most of them write often. But the ones I‚Äôm closest to almost never do so on their own.

I‚Äôve gotten used to this dynamic, to their way of being and seeing the world, and I love them for it too. I know they don‚Äôt do it on purpose, and I see them behave the same way with everyone else, so I don‚Äôt feel cheated or insulted or less loved. It‚Äôs just a fact: my closest friends never check in, they take two weeks to reply to a text (for those who don‚Äôt live in the same city), when they reply at all. This aligns with my worldview‚ÄîI value the freedom to act, the idea of not spending your life on your phone, and especially the belief that we owe no one explanations. We are free to respond to whomever we want, whenever we want, contrary to the constant messaging of our era. We have the right to be unavailable.

That said, there‚Äôs one particular friend, let‚Äôs call him F, who I‚Äôve been very close to for ten years. He‚Äôs an amazing person in every way. We get along so well, we have the same sense of humor, we‚Äôre always by each other‚Äôs side at parties, we tell each other everything, we make music together, and do so many things. But for the past two months or so, he‚Äôs been upsetting me.

Long story short, he‚Äôs exactly the type of person who never replies. He‚Äôs infamous for it in our group of friends, everyone calls him out on it, he knows it, and he laughs about it. His response patterns are more erratic than anyone I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôve lost count of how many times he‚Äôs been talking to me, seen his phone buzz, glanced at it, and flipped it over. Or opened a message, read it, and never replied.  
He‚Äôs very socially confident. Everyone likes him, he has a lot of friends and is constantly invited to drinks, outings, and events. Over the past year, his responsiveness towards me had improved significantly. He almost always replied, and we saw each other a lot.

But over the past two months, he‚Äôs barely replied to me. And, in this case, it feels very targeted and incomprehensible to me. The other day, I ran into a mutual friend on the street, and we stopped for a coffee near F‚Äôs place. We thought, ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs call him.‚Äù I called him; he didn‚Äôt pick up. My friend called him five minutes later, and he answered.  
Another time, I tried calling him to grab a beer; he didn‚Äôt answer. Two minutes later, I ran into his girlfriend, who for an unrelated reason called him‚Äîand he answered immediately.  
He hasn‚Äôt replied to several of my messages in a row, even though he‚Äôs active in our group chat.

I feel like he‚Äôs avoiding me, even though nothing happened. I went to one of our friend‚Äôs birthday parties recently, and he was there. The first thing he said to me‚Äîwithout me even bringing it up because I wouldn‚Äôt, since it‚Äôs not in my values to guilt someone over their response habits‚Äîwas, ‚ÄúOh, wow, sorry, I haven‚Äôt replied to you in weeks... I don‚Äôt even know why.‚Äù  
Then, later that night, he came to talk to me, suggested we hang out soon, and all that. So, everything‚Äôs probably fine, I guess.

But the fact is, I realize this kind of behavior affects my mood, a little hold over me that I‚Äôd like to break free from. The issue isn‚Äôt his behavior‚Äîhe‚Äôs free to act as he wants. The issue is the insecurity it stirs in me. I don‚Äôt want to make him change. What I want is to work on myself so I don‚Äôt feel insecure when a friend, for no apparent reason, stops responding to me. I always end up thinking it‚Äôs my fault, that I must have done something wrong‚Äîeven though I never actually do. I‚Äôm careful with others. Or I fear the person will stop loving me‚Äîyada yada‚Äîall those things we inherit from a childhood where we were taught that love must be earned, with an absent father, left to fend for oneself early on.

Ultimately, I‚Äôd like to work on myself to respond to such situations with love for myself rather than doubts, to feel a surge of kindness toward myself instead of self-reproach.

1i70awt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Codependency/comments/1i70awt/i_need_advice/,I need advice.,"Today marks the six month anniversary I have with my girlfriend. She hasn't texted or called in 6 days (which is not new). I guess I'm looking for some sort of advice or opinion on my current situation. 

Here's a little backstory:

When we first met, we both fell for each other immediately. I wasn't working due to an injury and she was out of school (currently in her 4th year now of university as of Jan. '25) for the summer and working at a restaurant as a bartender. She would invite me to the bar during her shifts to keep her company, and I did. So right off the bat we were spending a lot of time together within the first couple weeks. Then, less than a month in, we became inseparable after I basically moved in with her (as I had no work at the time and would see her down the street when she was working). She'd leave the apartment for work, I'd wake up, clean the apartment, then shower and head down to see her and hang out for her whole shift. She was always so excited to see me and would stop someone mid-conversation to come out and hug me. It was a wonderful time. We spent almost the whole summer together. 

Just before the school year began, the lease to her apartment was up and she had to move in with her Dad, and I had to go back to my parents'. We agreed that since she had a vehicle that the priority would be for me to find a place to rent once I started work as opposed to getting my licence renewed which would be a lengthy process and a financial drain. No problems there, though, and I currently have a tour with a nice apartment booked for this Saturday. 

The first semester was a little rocky for her in terms of grades and meeting deadlines as we were still tapering off of our summer party mode. And I'm guilty of not declining nights of drinking with her when I should have. I think reality finally set in this December when she had to study for and complete \~8 assignments/exams which is when she went radio silent for approximately three weeks (with proper warning, though, and I respected the fact that she was going to buckle down and pass the first semester regardless of our extra curricular behaviour + I trusted her). 

In the beginning, she was never a huge texter and would take her time to respond, but she always ended up responding regardless of the subject matter. Perhaps it was just the initial getting-to-know-each-other period where she thought it'd be beneficial for me to know her opinion on simple things like cheeses and new releases on Netflix, because throughout getting to know her it has become quite evident that she is more of a bigger-picture person when it comes to conversation, meanwhile I can dabble in both. She has even said that I'm more of a ""micro"" person and she is ""macro"" in terms of personality. I still disagree somewhat, but I do admit that I'm guilty of delivering ""nothing texts"" while I'm at work and bored just for the sake of texting. She, however, isn't. Which leads to many texts left on read and many days without a single text.

I've brought this up to her in the past and have said that I know it's meaningless conversation to her, but just a simple ""hey"" daily would suffice just to acknowledge my... existence... y'know? She's admitted that she's bad in that department and has tried to check-in a few times. I was having a rough night once and told her I had called a friend instead to go to a pool hall instead of calling her first, yet she tried to assure me I could call her about anything in the nicest voice I've ever heard. 

Now she's onto her 2nd semester of this fourth year and I'm back to working full-time. She has made it very clear that school is the priority for her - and I have absolutely zero issues with that as work is a priority for me, as well. It's just that in the past three weeks I've seen her only three times, talked on the phone three times and maybe texted 6 times. **Am I overreacting here or am I just not used to the status quo that was once our schedule of continuous fun and debauchery with little to no repercussions and that now since we have much more stable lives I'm experiencing some sort of detachment issue or love withdrawal?** I try not to let it bug me and I am getting better at the ruminating and negative thought spirals trying to decipher her lack of communication, because I know she's got a lot on her plate with school and family problems, but it still bugs me a little bit. I don't think I'm crazy for wanting a text daily or even every other day... and feeling disrespected when all I've ever texted her lately about was if she's doing okay (due to family and school scheduling issues) in addition to lending an ear the little time we have in person over dinner or coffee so she can vent about the aforementioned problems. 

I've really been biting my tongue lately as I feel any sort of subtle approach via text may just push her further away. It also doesn't help that even though she has thanked me for checking in daily via a text (regardless if she responds or not), it looks like I'm unhinged because the conversation is flooded with blue chat bubbles coming from my side only most of the time. I'm also very sentimental and don't think she shares the same view on the whole 6 month milestone as me. In the beginning, we said we'd never do gifts on our anniversaries, just quality time. She told me over coffee last Tuesday that she'd be busy today (which is fine, because I work and her schooling is important to me), and that we'd celebrate this coming weekend.

So I stole the idea. It didn‚Äôt do too badly.

**1. Georgetown**  
A historic, cobblestone wonderland where everything costs double because it looks *vintage*. Good luck finding parking without a trust fund or navigating the crowds of influencers taking selfies by the canal. Everyone here is either a college student or pretending they still are.  

**2. Adams Morgan**  
Your quintessential frat party neighborhood‚Äîbeer pong in the basement, rooftop margs, and a pizza slice the size of your head at 2 AM. It‚Äôs quirky until you realize the quirk is just drunken chaos on a nightly basis.   

**3. Dupont Circle**  
Where old money liberals sip overpriced lattes while complaining about capitalism. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the charm‚Äîit‚Äôs where ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù is just a euphemism for self-congratulation. Bonus points if you own a dog you refer to as your ‚Äúchild.‚Äù  

**4. Capitol Hill**  
A neighborhood full of power suits and backroom deals. Everyone is ‚Äúworking on the Hill‚Äù (read: fetching coffee for someone who actually has power). The homes are beautiful but cost more than a senator‚Äôs salary, ironically purchased with the lobbyist money you claim to disdain.  

**5. U Street**  
You can‚Äôt throw a rock here without hitting a ‚Äúrestored‚Äù speakeasy or a mural someone will tell you is *iconic*. It‚Äôs where history meets gentrification in the form of $18 cocktails and a two-hour wait for brunch.  

**6. Foggy Bottom**  
This is where tourists mistake George Washington University‚Äôs campus for a trendy neighborhood. It‚Äôs like someone built a city block for corporate interns who haven‚Äôt figured out where the cool parts of DC actually are.  

**7. Navy Yard**  
A shiny, new urban playground for people who think ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù means taking a selfie by Nationals Park. The vibe screams, ‚ÄúI pay $4,000 a month for a studio and tell myself it‚Äôs worth it because there‚Äôs a Whole Foods downstairs.‚Äù  

**8. Shaw**  
This once-vibrant cultural hub is now where tech bros and artisanal coffee shops have come to die. They call it ‚Äúup-and-coming,‚Äù but it‚Äôs really just been fully ‚Äúcome-and-gone‚Äù by gentrification.  

**9. Columbia Heights**  
The place where Target is the biggest cultural landmark. A mix of longtime residents and newcomers pretending they‚Äôre not the reason rent is unaffordable. It‚Äôs diverse, but the tension is palpable, especially at the Trader Joe‚Äôs checkout line.  

**10. Anacostia**  
The city‚Äôs forgotten stepchild‚Äîpraised for its potential, yet somehow always left out of the investment that other neighborhoods get. People talk about ‚Äúrevitalization,‚Äù but they really just mean displacing locals for overpriced condos.  

**11. Logan Circle**  
The kingdom of yuppies where everyone pretends to be laid-back while obsessively comparing property values. Expect immaculate brownstones and equally immaculate egos.  

**12. Chevy Chase**  
Not quite DC, but its residents will die before admitting they live in Maryland. It‚Äôs essentially a suburb dressed up in city taxes‚Äîgood schools, big lawns, and zero nightlife.  

All in good fun‚Äîevery neighborhood has its charm, even if it‚Äôs buried under irony or overdevelopment.",0,1737512367.0,washingtondc,7,0.17,False

I am finally looking into getting myself into making espresso and was wondering it the current 1Zpresso K-Max grinder would be sufficient because I am not sure if I should be getting another grinder or just get a better machine.

My options are:

1. Gaggia Classic EVO Pro + Varia VS3 Grinder (Gen 2)
2. Rancilio Silvia V6 +¬†*use my current grinder*
3. ECM Casa V +¬†*use my current grinder*

What do you guys reckon??

Thanks in advance!",1,1737512218.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

Early I went to Mr. Crew's, and having given Mr. Edward money to give the servants, I took him into the coach that waited for us and carried him to my house, where the coach waited for me while I and the child went to Westminster Hall, and bought him some pictures. In the Hall I met Mr. Woodfine, and took him to Will's and drank with him. Thence the child and I to the coach, where my wife was ready, and so we went towards Twickenham. In our way, at Kensington we understood how that my Lord Chesterfield had killed another gentleman about half an hour before, and was fled. We went forward and came about one of the clock to Mr. Fuller's, but he was out of town, so we had a dinner there, and I gave the child 40s. to give to the two ushers. After that we parted and went homewards, it being market day at Brainford. I set my wife down and went with the coach to Mr. Crew's, thinking to have spoke with Mr. Moore and Mrs. Jem, he having told me the reason of his melancholy was some unkindness from her after so great expressions of love, and how he had spoke to her friends and had their consent, and that he would desire me to take an occasion of speaking with her, but by no means not to heighten her discontent or distaste whatever it be, but to make it up if I can. But he being out of doors, I went away and went to see Mrs. Jem, who was now very well again, and after a game or two at cards, I left her. So I went to the Coffee Club, and heard very good discourse; it was in answer to Mr. Harrington's answer, who said that the state of the Roman government was not a settled government, and so it was no wonder that the balance of propriety was in one hand, and the command in another, it being therefore always in a posture of war; but it was carried by ballot, that it was a steady government, though it is true by the voices it had been carried before that it was an unsteady government; so to-morrow it is to be proved by the opponents that the balance lay in one hand, and the government in another. Thence I went to Westminster, and met Shaw and Washington, who told me how this day Sydenham was voted out of the House for sitting any more this Parliament, and that Salloway was voted out likewise and sent to the Tower, during the pleasure of the House. Home and wrote by the Post, and carried to Whitehall, and coming back turned in at Harper-'s, where Jack Price was, and I drank with him and he told me, among other, things, how much the Protector is altered, though he would seem to bear out his trouble very well, yet he is scarce able to talk sense with a man; and how he will say that ""Who should a man trust, if he may not trust to a brother and an uncle;"" and ""how much those men have to answer before God Almighty, for their playing the knave with him as they did."" He told me also, that there was; L100,000 offered, and would have been taken for his restitution, had not the Parliament come in as they did again; and that he do believe that the Protector will live to give a testimony of his valour and revenge yet before he dies, and that the Protector will say so himself sometimes. Thence I went home, it being late and my wife in bed.",1,1737512101.0,Pepys,0,1.0,False
