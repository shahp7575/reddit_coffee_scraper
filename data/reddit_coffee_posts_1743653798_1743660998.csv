As you can see, I made hcs abt my two fav rarepairs + one of my otps. Hope you like them! 

(also posted this on my tumblr + r/Osana (never again) except this one is slightly tweaked)

I. Reiichi Tanaami X Teiko Nabatasai

Secret admirer letters, maybee? 

Reiichi would call her names like ‚Äòdarling‚Äô, ‚Äòmy love‚Äô etc etc etc any formal nickname. But Teiko, on the other hand, chooses to call him by his title of President. 

Chivalry ‚Ñ¢

Hmmm.. how about heartwarming compliments whenever they're alone?

Reiichi wrote a whole ass list of approx. 1000 reasons on why he absolutely adores Teiko (it's all about her personality, her traits and her talents). 

His parents approve of her, but his sister would probably talk shit since she's the spoiled, self-indulgent motherfucker she is. (And he would totally not throw hands, hehe!)

Some of the teachers would probably tease both of them. Even the damn Headmaster. 

‚Äú Does our prodigy like the President, hmm? ‚Äù or ‚Äú Seems like the prodigy is the only one who can melt the President's heart of ice, haha! ‚Äù

He likes to kiss her knuckle while kneeling down on one knee and gently holding her hand like the distinguished gentleman he is (in private, OBVI). 

Formality. They absolutely don't know how to be informal with each other. 

Once again (and in conclusion)... chivalrous Reiichi Tanaami is canon. 

II. Komako Funakoshi X Joze Shiuba

Komako would teach Joze Japanese, and tell him all about Japanese traditions and culture since she's traditional and all. 
As for him, he'd talk about all about Brazil to her. 

Joze would do cheesy ass math/science puns. He can be a little awkward at romantic gestures but hey, he'll get the hang of it. 

After Joze found out that Komako is interested in gardening, he bought her some flowers and a letter written in Portuguese because of his ass skill at writing Japanese. 
She'd protect him from any racism like for example: 

‚Äú Oh my gosh! Did you know that Joze is bad at Japanese like.. ‚Äù

‚Äú Um.. excuse me but please, you shouldn't talk about others like that. It's.. really disrespectful and can be hurtful. And just because Joze is bad at Japanese.. doesn't mean he's not an equal. He's human. Like you and me.. like all of us. It doesn't matter if he's a foreigner; he should still be treated with respect. ‚Äù

III. Hozumi Takeda X Sonoko Sakanoue

Justice Couple‚Ñ¢

‚Äú You know I can help you, right? You've been drinking way too much coffee lately. Plus, you haven't slept for.. at least 3 days trying to solve this case. ‚Äù

‚Äú Oh, quiet. I don't need help. I'm independent. ‚Äù

I like to imagine that when Sonoko was investigating Akademi, she'd protect Hozumi from danger. 

They'd probably read detective novels together during their free time. 

‚Äú I'm warning you, kid. Break her heart and I'll do more than just break your knees. ‚Äù ‚ÄîThe Journalist, circa 1989.

Sonoko is a PDA hater for life. So she would have to warm up to Hozumi in private in order to earn her soft side. Oh, and she prefers subtle gestures. So does he. 

She has boundaries and he respects them. Even in private, he always asks if she's comfortable enough for any form of physical affection. 

Fuck socializing, embrace solitude. Together. Periodt. 

I've always headcanoned Hozumi having PTSD so whenever he hears gunshots he would have panic attacks and Sonoko would appear in the *blink of an eye* even after hearing a single decible of Hozumi's miserable shrieking. ",1,1743660519.0,RyobaAishi,0,1.0,False

Download the Costa Coffee app and enter a referral code to get a **free** sweat treat of your choice. You **need to opt into receive marketing comms** to get the free cake voucher emailed to you.

New customers will **also receive 5 free ‚Äúbeans‚Äù** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

Steps:

* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link ([here](https://swf3j.app.goo.gl/C9HgF)).
* **Register** and enter the referral code **K9GUN**
* Remember to opt into comms to receive the free cake email on your birthday!
* To receive the ‚Äúfree‚Äù 5 beans first **make a purchase at Costa and scan the app when paying**.
* The 5 free beans will be **credited to your account within 48 hours** (it was immediately for me).

Pro tip, if it‚Äôs anything like Caff√® Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1jqavgt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqavgt,A few cafes I went to past week,"Good day to all!

First I would like to thank everyone sharing the cafes and roasters so I don't need to do too much research and trial and errors. Been to a few cafes named here and here are my experiences. Before I begin, I started the journey into this rabbit holes since 2017 and started to brew my own since last June, and been to Koffee Mameya 3 times prior.

Onibus (jiyugaoka) - latte (house blend light roast) and pour over (El Salvador). Latte was pretty light and I immediately understood why medium to dark roast still a go to for milk based coffee, it was nice but I prefer good medium to dark roasts. The pour over was good, maybe some astringency especially when it cools. Gotten a Ethiopian beans and yet to try brew them.

Light up coffee (Kichijoji) - A step up in general, tried a ""Juicy"" Kenyan pour over and it was juicy and distinctive berries! But like onibus, it still has slight astringency but slightly less so. I had another cup that's daily recommendation which is a Guatemala, it has more of the bourbon variety kind of taste (excuse my limited words for descriptions), slightly on the roasty side compared to the Kenya.

Coffee County (Kitazawa) - Upon the first sip I know I'm in for a treat. Had El Salvador and Colombia for pour overs which are fantastic. I bought those two bags of beans  and you just need to top up a little they'll brew you a cup, which they call ""service"" („Çµ„Éº„Éì„Çπ). Those two cups were completely clean and clear taste notes,  very enjoyable. I like the El Salvador more, it's a Honey process and has that interesting caramel or maple syrup taste notes, and first time I'm tasting what often came out on tasting notes - roasted nuts, in a very good way.

Baggage Coffee - I stumble across this when I'm on my way to Koffee Mameya, ordered a medium roast latte, it was still a little too milky and light, couldn't taste much of the tasting notes. Will come back again in the future for pour overs.

Koffee Mameya - so I'm here again for 4th time and it didn't disappoint. Got myself a cup of Hacienda Copey Geisha and boy, you don't need to be a Michelin Critiques to taste the distinctive grapefruits. It was just as clean as what Coffee County was doing, but it's a Geisha! Just that with such pricey beans, they only brew a 12.5g/200g (if I'm not wrong judging from the yield) for 2000yen. The joy didn't last as long as I wanted ü§£.

I've had a couple months of screw ups and now I'm drinking a lot of caffeine again, but I'm just curious if anybody else has these symptoms when drinking caffeine? 

Today I had probably 300mg and my body was extremely hot the whole day, and still is at 1AM. I feel like I'm overheating even though the temp is at 64 in my room. I'm in great shape but today my heart started racing and after going up 4 flights of stairs I almost felt like my heart was gonna stop. I get weird dissociative symptoms and even depersonalization. My nervous system seems to go absolutely haywire. My digestive system is so bloated and tense that it's more challenging to breathe. My whole life I used to drink 300-500mg of caffeine a day with absolutely no problem and as I've gotten older (33 now) my body reacts horribly to caffeine more and more. My parents are close to their 70s and they still drink 3 cups of coffee a day no problem so I'm not sure it's a genetic thing. So I guess my question is, has the effects of caffeine gotten worse for you over time?

There is likely a connection to my days of being a binge drinker (sober now for 4 years) and the way it did serious damage to my nervous system. Anyway, gonna taper off for the next couple days and face the music. I enjoy the dopamine I get from caffeine as somebody who is prone to depression, but the extreme anxiety it has been causing almost outweighs the benefits of being less depressed. At one point a couple years back I was off for 4 months and felt amazing, but it really took some serious time to start feeling normal with my mood. Best of luck to y'all.

> ""If..."" she pauses again, taking a deep breath and looking off to the side as if bored already. ""If I was in a talkative mood, I might spin a tale. Some long winded story about an old man, so powerful and so overwhelmed by grief that he could stop the world turning and end all life on this planet. A decrepit man so blinded by loss that he needed reminding not only of his own power and the power of those who believed in him but of who his real enemies are, and the dangerous power that they wield. That, in his misery, he has set his sights on a target so miniscule and disorganized - it is beneath him. This is beneath him and his search for vengeance may damn us all and lose him the only family he has left."" 

‚ÄúFreeze simulation. Rewind point two seconds. Scan for vocal inflections.‚Äù Regicide stared at the holographic simulation of Psion before her, her eyes narrowed. She had perfectly reconstructed the cell they‚Äôd spoken in, the cell where she‚Äôd figured out that she wasn‚Äôt just a pretty face, but probably the smartest of those freaks in the Brotherhood, and the simulation was basically essential to figuring out what the hell her game was. 

<Vocal inflections match with other records. Subject is sincere.>

‚ÄúAlright. She‚Äôs on the level. But, what the hell am I missing? Why would she be so obsessed with getting Magneto back on track, and how does being taken prisoner help with that?‚Äù She took a swig of her coffee, the mug proclaiming she was, in fact, prepared to kill for her coffee. Which, while basic, did effectively depict her mood. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not crazy. If she was crazy, I woulda sparked a reaction from her. No, she‚Äôs not *crazy*, but she is driven.‚Äù

She slumped into a chair, looking at the simulation. Three weeks of work and she‚Äôd not even figured out what she was up to. What did the telepath want beyond intel on the Institute, intel she could have easily gotten by ripping apart John‚Äôs psyche. There was something wrong, something she was missing. 

‚ÄúOkay, so she lets us take her prisoner to gather intelligence, but on what? She didn‚Äôt have telepathy so she doesn‚Äôt have any of our actual names, unless someone let them slip, and she didn‚Äôt get her powers back till the hostage exchange. Which means she didn‚Äôt get what she was looking for *until* the exchange, whatever that was, if she got it at all.  Or, she just wanted information on our mutations, but that seems too small for her. I know there‚Äôs something missing from this picture, something that will answer is without a doubt. I hate this. I figured her out before, but I‚Äôm missing something. Something big.‚Äù

Her hand snaked out and grabbed her coffee, taking a sip and making a face. It had gotten cold. Shit. She‚Äôd been at this for a while. She had to take a break, or do something else with the information. Or, she had to find a way to get in contact with her. Get more information from her. But, that would be too risky. She wasn‚Äôt a solo act, but her team‚Ä¶infiltrating the Avalon was definitely on the checklist, bonus points for sabotage. Maybe if she bodyslid to earth and thought real hard, she‚Äôd be able to get her to just show up. But that was a separate problem.

‚ÄúComputer, pause simulation at current timestamp, save progress and close simulation.‚Äù

Right now, she needed to get to work. Lyon was waiting.


**One Day Later, Deck 35, Starship *Greymalkin*, Earth Orbit**

Regicide sat down in her hair in a little meeting room she‚Äôd taken for herself once she‚Äôd sorted out her team. The mission in Lyon had been an experience and thank god for Elixir, otherwise she would‚Äôve died. But hey, that was the risk she took every time, it hadn‚Äôt really hit her confidence, but she was more annoyed that she‚Äôd not been able to kill Abda. He was probably dossier number one on her threatlist, and she needed to deal with that. But just as worrying was this Zenith character, whose powers were more varied than she liked from her Brotherhood members.

And there was the Darkblood Academy. A problem in a thousand forms, but most importantly, a Brotherhood pipeline, the kind that she just didn‚Äôt want or need. Infiltrating it was going to be a headache and a half. Fortunately, her face was completely unknown to the Brotherhood, as was Bram‚Äôs. Warp, on the other hand, wasn‚Äôt gonna be useful for that gig. But, potential was there, if the Avalon wasn‚Äôt their other target. She let out a sigh, looking at the two mutants in the small meeting room.

‚ÄúWell, welcome to X-Force. Again. So, our last mission! It went well, overall, but it does cement something that I want to talk about.‚Äù She clicked a button, activating a holographic display of the three mutants they fought. ‚ÄúWe handled ourselves well enough mano a mano, but what happens when there‚Äôs more of them? We need to work on just jumping people. Three on one, especially with the powers we have, is more viable.‚Äù

She looked at Bram. ‚ÄúI need you to have a codename yesterday. It‚Äôs dangerous in the field to be yelling your real name, especially since we‚Äôre a covert team. Theoretically, anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúWarp, good work with the misdirect, but next time I think we should focus up on using your powers for mobility. I don‚Äôt want anyone to get fucked up like I did, it would literally kill either of you.‚Äù

She leaned back in the chair, looking over them both. ‚ÄúSo. It‚Äôs time for an actual mission statement. Cecil, Elias and Jaxon are leading the teams that do all the big heroics. The fancy, newsworthy crap. Going forward, however, we‚Äôve got a different role.‚Äù

She created holograms of Abigail Brand, Haemoknight, Psion, Bolivar Trask, Cain. ‚ÄúOur enemies have a lot of backers. A lot of people throwing money into their pockets and they‚Äôve got resources we don‚Äôt. And, most importantly, they‚Äôve got spies, while we don‚Äôt. Which is where we come in. X-Force is our spy circle. Sure, there aren‚Äôt a lot of us, but there doesn‚Äôt have to be. I picked the two of you based entirely on two things. One, apart from the France mission, and Warp‚Äôs recruitment, you haven‚Äôt *really* crossed paths with the Brotherhood, and two, your powers are perfect for distractions, transportation and infiltration.‚Äù

Julie let out a sigh, massaging the bridge of her nose. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been on the backfoot for too long. We need to take the fight to the Brotherhood and *more importantly*, we‚Äôve been letting SWORD just turn the US into a police state without doing anything about this. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, we‚Äôre going to have to kill people, odds are. If you‚Äôre out, you‚Äôre out. No hard feelings, no pressure, I can find another mutant.

1jqasc7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqasc7,How to repair this steamer trunk?,"
I bought this steamer trunk yesterday and have been watching YouTube videos and Googling how to restore it and make it usable as a coffee table.

The problem I encountered is that the tools used in tutorials are more advanced, or the steamer trunks seem to be made of different materials, on the outside.

What would you recommend I do with average tools at home, or what are some cheap tools worth buying?

Specifically, how can I make the top part look more presentableand reduce the scratches and this white liquid that dripped down the side?

I enlisted back when I was 18 and I did 4 years active an now I am doing Reserves because hey Dad says go to college at home and the family will help with everything, I was already working on getting my bachleors degree and than start on a Associate degree and sure the hours sucked but hey I worked it out. It wasn't till last year when I reupped that my Dad said I should go reserves and do just 1 weekend a month while focusing on school. 
I probably said yes while surviving off a 5 monsters and some crappy barracks coffee and honestly I wished I said no.
Now here I am 22 years old scrapping by for money with the ""support of the family"" while my Dad and I are getting into arguments over the dumbest things and for me trying to find work even tho it was his idea for me to be home and yet I am actively looking for jobs in my area(small town)

Yes I have a roof over my head but everything else is coming out of my pockets and I can't go anywhere else because California it's so fcking expensive for no reason. 
At this point I might as well go change my contract and leave like I did when I was 18 but I don't want to leave my younger brother while my Dad is like this because I know damn well he is going to pull the same shit he did to me when i was 14.

1jqajk3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqajk3,Please STOP about the price,"People are making way too much noise over Nintendo Switch 2 game prices. Everyone is acting like the sky is falling because some games are $70 or $80. Some are even yelling that physical copies might be $90. Forbes is saying Nintendo has ‚Äúflipped the switch‚Äù on $80 and $90 games. Reddit is full of people panicking over rumors. But let‚Äôs stop and look at reality.

Donkey Kong Bananza is $69.99. That‚Äôs not $80. That‚Äôs not $90. It is listed at that price on Walmart, Best Buy, and Nintendo‚Äôs own website. That right there proves that not all Switch 2 games are $80 or $90. Some games will be more expensive. Some will not. You are blowing this out of proportion.

You want to know the truth? The problem is not the prices. The problem is your budget. The problem is you. You expect the entire world to change just so your favorite games stay at a price that feels comfortable. You expect the economy to freeze for your entertainment. That is not how life works. That is not how money works.

Let me explain something very simple. The world does not revolve around what you want the price of a video game to be. The world around you does not need to confirm or conform to what you expect. $60 games became more common around 2006. That was 19 years ago. Almost two decades. And somehow, games have mostly stayed at that same price ever since.

Meanwhile, everything else has gone up and down in price. That is called inflation. It means the value of your money goes down. Things cost more. That is just how the world works. The fact that games have stayed at $60 for 19 years is actually amazing. You should be grateful. But instead of being thankful, people are acting entitled. Like you are owed cheap games forever. You are not.

Grow up. Stop living in fantasyland. The price is not too high just because you don‚Äôt like it. You do not get to tell the economy what things are supposed to cost. You are not owed a $60 game just because you decided that was the magic number. If the price does not fit your budget, maybe you are not supposed to buy it right now.

And if you are the kind of person who says this makes you unhappy, maybe you should think about where your joy really comes from. If a material object is the only thing that brings you happiness, you need to re-evaluate your life. As a Christian, my joy comes from God. It comes from the fact that I wake up each day with breath in my lungs. That I have a purpose. That I can love others and be loved. That I can live.

Even if you do not believe in God, you still have something to be thankful for. You get to live. You get to watch the snow fall. You get to feel the warmth of the sun. You get to enjoy the smell of rain. You get to listen to the birds, feel the breeze, and sit with the people you love. All of that has value. All of that is free. But you are over here crying about an $80 game like your life is over.

You chose to buy a $500 console. You chose to buy the game. You chose to prioritize that over something else in your budget. Now you are sad that you have to make sacrifices in other areas. That is not Nintendo‚Äôs fault. That is not the economy‚Äôs fault. That is your fault.

If you are spending $6 to $8 at Starbucks every day, you are burning through over $160 per month on coffee. That is two full games. That is most of a console. But I do not hear you complain about that. If you eat out all the time or shop at the most expensive grocery store when you could save money elsewhere, again, that is your choice. You are wasting money on things you do not need. Then you turn around and complain that a video game costs too much.

You wanted a new console. You wanted 4K. You wanted better graphics. You wanted new Mario games and more power. You got it. Now you are upset because the prices went up too. What did you expect? A $200 4K console and $50 brand-new games? This is not a fairy tale.

You need to stop. Look around. Understand that prices rise. Inflation is real. Production costs go up. Technology gets more expensive. This is how the world works. You can cry about it all you want, but it is not going to change reality. The sooner you accept that, the easier your life will be.

Stop complaining. Stop blaming companies. Stop blaming the world. The problem is not the game. The problem is not Nintendo. The problem is not the price.

A few years later, still quietly unraveling, after a relationship break down he begins to confront what he saw through the unlikely connection he forms with a woman he meets. I've started in the last week or so and have punched out around 10,000 words of it, albeit bits and pieces from all over the story. This is my first attempt at anything like this and I'm enjoying the prosses so far. I'm finding it all very cathartic.  
I want to use memory(flash backs) as a tool in my story telling but I'm not sure how I should. His ex-partner is an important person no longer in his life and I'd like to cast back to her here and there. I'm not quite sure how. Here's a short example I hope you all don't mind.

\---------

Adam nodded slowly. He didn‚Äôt answer. He stood, crossed to the room, and pulled the blind back just enough to look out. The street was quiet, the bus stop out front had no one waiting at it.

‚ÄúI hate feeling like a ghost,‚Äù he said, almost to himself.

Billy stayed quiet. After a breath, Adam let the blind fall back into place.

He knelt down at the box. Turned over the photograph. Vivienne, smiling over her shoulder in the kitchen, her ruby hair looked like romance itself. Boxes still sitting on the benches ready to be unpacked from the move.

He placed down it face up and closed the box again.

The kitchen used to smell like coffee grinds and garlic. She always cooked barefoot, hair pulled up, music playing low from the turntable. He saw her there now, dancing between bench and stove, humming along to a Miles Davis.

She turned, smiled. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch the sauce.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt going to.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were.‚Äù

She kissed his cheek anyway.

They ate on the floor, surrounded by boxes they promised to unpack tomorrow. Her wine glass left a ring on the floorboard. They didn‚Äôt care. She rested her head on his chest, her finger tracing the line of his jaw. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go quiet on me,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here,‚Äù he said, exhaling softly.

She didn‚Äôt answer. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get changed.‚Äù

Had a weird experience...,"Just had another zombie dream and have only been asleep for 2 hours. This time was different. Heard about the infection some how and decided to stay home. But only my mom, me, aunt, and a coworker lived together. Our house was fairly the same but right in the city. I got so paranoid of everything that I covered up my windows and did research and kept staring out the windows. It was snowy, there was an insane amount of people, and I felt a real sense of impending doom, anxiety, and anger. I told my family stuff like ""dude it's coming right for us, the storm is literally here, we gotta bunker down, etc"" but none of them listened, matter of fact my mother passively mocked me... The dream turned into me helping a man who ""had a different strain"" one where he doesn't eat people but just sorta dies. But I was helping him with stuff in my same house but empty. It felt dark and erie. I kept looking outside and I can *always* see one of those zombies just mindlessly roaming, trying to attack the perfect person. I don't know if I ever felt as scared as I have in this dream. I didn't even know it was a dream it felt way too real. I can usually play it off like haha that was realistic except for me flying, but this.... has a different vibe to it... I'm telling myself right now it's obviously fake and I'm an idiot but something keeps telling me no it's not.. it is super windy right now where I'm at but right before I woke up, a big snow storm came through in my dream and there was nobody. I kept all doors locked and covered and kept thinking about how the ARMY always fell in zombie shows and I'm fucked, my family is fucked, I'm gonna get torn to shreds alive. 

After I woke up I felt a really strong urge to go check my window, I drank a whole bottle of water, and wrote this. I don't think I got all the details but this is what I could write down. Is there any way to decipher what in the fuck this was? Why did it happen? I feel like something is telling me the world is about to pull the trigger on itself and catastrophic stuff is about to go down. I know that isn't true, but like that lonely demon who makes sure he's there, but from a distance, but still in sight... you know? 

Only thing I can think of to trigger something like this is a big ass bucket of Popeyes chicken, and iced coffee about 30 minutes before bed lol. If anyone can figure this out, or wants to add something I'm all ears!

Their website no longer exists, their Instagram is still up but hasn't been active in years, and I cannot find anything about the brand or company when I Google them. I only found a handful of them on eBay being sold. 

I bought some and I must say these are perhaps the most unique notebooks I've come across. Pocket size or otherwise. The designs of the covers giving a theme with the paper inside, which has more than one kind inside the notebooks themselves. The feel of them is great as well. I bought a coffee themed set and they were not only packaged to look like a bag of coffee beans but they even smell like it too! 

So I'm just wondering...does anyone know what happened to the brand/company? I can't imagine them going out of business with such a great product.

**Why This Pick?**

I have to say, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be betting on the Magic at this time of year ‚Äì but here we are! To be honest, this might be one of the best plays on the board. Not only are the Wizards playing this encounter on a back-to-back, but the Magic have won their last 5 straight games against Washington, and the last 3 wins have all been by more than 15 points. To boot, the Wizards have lost 8 of their last 10 outings. As far as this game is concerned, the Magic spread is the only play that really makes sense. I‚Äôm rolling the dice on a comfortable road win for Orlando.

1jqa90a,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HopelessX_xRomantic/comments/1jqa90a/to_doctor_im_tired_of_everyone_getting_in_my_head/,To Doctor - (I'm tired of everyone getting in my head),"I wasn‚Äôt ready for you to leave.

I wanted to fight for you, I would have. I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs, ""Don‚Äôt go! Please, stay...."" I would‚Äôve traveled any distance, carried any burden, stood beside you in your silence, your sorrow, your healing. I meant every word I ever said.

So why did you leave me with confusion, with no closure, with a heart that still aches like you‚Äôre just out of reach?

You told me I was good enough, but your actions left me feeling abandoned. I keep asking myself what went wrong. Was there more you never said? Did I say too much? Not enough? Was I ever really seen?

I fell for you, not because I wanted to, but because something in you called to me. It's rare, so rare, that I let myself love like this. You were the exception. I didn‚Äôt want this to end.

Everyone tells me to wait, to give you time, but the distance is torture. If you hate me, at least that would give me a reason to let go. But you never said that. Instead, I‚Äôm left feeling everything‚Ä¶while you say nothing.

If I wasn‚Äôt as beautiful as you said, just tell me. If it was all limerence for you, just say it. At least then I‚Äôd have a reason to stop hoping.

I wasn‚Äôt asking for a fairytale. I would‚Äôve taken friendship, conversations about your day, your feelings, your passions, your silence. Coffee in a quiet corner of the world. Anything. I just wanted you.

You changed my life. My husband saw it, he saw me light up. He even asked if you still wanted the photo‚Ä¶ if maybe it would bring you back. Everything was shifting because of you.

I want you to know something clearly, the times when I seemed back and forth about meeting you, that indecision wasn‚Äôt mine. It was my husband‚Äôs. He was struggling too, and in his confusion, he made it seem like I was the one hesitating. He‚Äôs apologized deeply for that. I want you to know that I was 100% ready to meet you. If you ever return, he will not be interfering in any way. That part of the confusion is over.

So no, I can‚Äôt pretend you‚Äôre replaceable. I tried to move on. I tried. I failed. I still feel you. That‚Äôs what hurts the most, how close you still feel when you‚Äôre not here.

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Whether to wait. Whether to walk away. Whether to just leave this account untouched, like a door slightly open, hoping one day you might return.

But if this truly is goodbye, if you never felt what I felt, then please, give me the truth. I don‚Äôt want to carry questions for the rest of my life.

Just tell me,
Was it real for you at all?

1jqa3m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jqa3m8/aita_for_telling_the_real_reason_im_no_longer_a/,AITA for telling the real reason I‚Äôm no longer a bridesmaid,"I (25f) had been friends with Cammy (25f) since kindergarten when her family moved next door to mine when we were both 6. We have been through everything together and once considered the other as a sister. We both have even moved to the same state to be close to one another.  

About two years ago Cammy started dating Andrew (36m) who I did not like. He was a lot older than her and just did not seem like the right guy for her. She once asked me what I thought of him at the beginning of their relationship and I told her my opinion of him being too old, but she told me that everything was fine and that age was just a number. I honestly didn't see anything else bad about him, so I eventually learned to let that go, but always had that uneasy feeling about him. 

Eight months ago Andrew proposed to Cammy and she immediately asked me to be a bridesmaid. I said yes and was happy for her. Her wedding was in late February of this year. 

In early November Cammy comes over to my apartment to tell me that she had been actively cheating on Andrew for the past six months with some guy from her work. She told me that Andrew found out and instead of getting angry with her, asked for her forgiveness and wanted to know as to how he could be a better partner to her because he was failing her. She said the reason she was telling me was to go ahead and get it off her chest before I found out from someone else and thought badly of her. When she told me I could tell she had no remorse and didn't even regret her cheating. 

I was shocked and asked if she regretted what she did and she said it hurt her to see Andrew so upset, but she explained that things were so ""hot"" at work that the tension was too much for her and her coworker to ignore. I told her that I was no longer going to be a bridesmaid and wasn't going to attend her wedding because I don't associate myself with cheaters and no longer supported her marriage, especially since she did not think what she did was wrong. 

Cammy got very mad at me and told me off and eventually blocked me on everything. I never explained to anyone about her cheating for my reason as to why I chose not to go and I made sure to not talk bad about Cammy to anyone who asked because I did consider her to be a sister. We have not talked since that day and I know she and Andrew got married. 

Fast forward to last week and I am out with my bf at a coffee shop where I run into one of Cammy's bridesmaids that is also one of her coworkers. She walked up to me and asked how I was and I said fine and told her it was good to see her. She then apologized for being too forward, but wanted to know if Cammy and I ever made up after our ""incident"" before her wedding. Confused, I asked what the incident was and she eventually told me that Cammy explained to the bridal party that I chose to leave because of my feelings for Andrew and that I couldn't see him get married because of how I felt. 

I was appalled. Not only did I not have any romantic feelings for Andrew, I never even really liked him! I told the bridesmaid that the reason I left was because of Cammy's affair with her coworker, who she knows as well because they all work together. When I told her that, the bridesmaid said she remembered Cammy and the coworker being close, but didn't know about the affair. She left the coffee shop not long after the conversation and I felt guilty about telling her that since I haven't told anyone. My bf says me telling her that makes it look as if I'm trying to hurt Cammy and Andrew, therefore making it seem as if I do like Andrew. 

Aita for telling her that? I don't know if she told Cammy I said that, and I don't know how Cammy and Andrew are doing, but I do feel bad that I shared her business to someone she works with. ",1,1743657377.0,AITAH,6,0.67,False

Hi mamas! I‚Äôm a 31 year SAHM of 3 kiddos who recently moved here in a small town in Colorado and I‚Äôve been trying to navigate life, motherhood, and everything in between. It‚Äôs been a little tough lately‚ÄîI don‚Äôt drive yet and there‚Äôs no public transport where we are, so I‚Äôve been feeling a bit stuck and isolated.

I‚Äôm an awkward introvert but im getting better now since I‚Äôve been working on myself a lot and realized I need to get out more and explore or help other moms. I am hoping to find an online group, preferably an app, or just local community where I can meet fellow moms to chat with, vent to, and connect with‚Äîmaybe even form friendships or find a future BESTIE if we vibe that much. I‚Äôd love to talk about mom life, wife life, or just life in general.

Some things I enjoy and would love to bond over: Playdates and parenting chats, Podcasts, I follow mom blogs, health fitness etc., Going to the gym (or just talking about it haha), Coffee, thrifting, Pinterest inspo, Sharing recipes or making failed experiments lol, skincare, baking, gardening ideas, talking small business/craft projects, hiking, Random wholesome fun like karaoke, spa days, thrifting, libraries, or just hanging at the park/playground, family church (recently just started but would love to get into it more)

Basically I‚Äôm looking for my village‚Äîor even just ONE mom friend who gets it. It can get lonely sometimes and hubby always work. I think there‚Äôs a fellow mom there who also feels the way I do and we and our kids would benefit greatly from socialization. Leme know if you‚Äôre in a similar boat or know a great group/app/community I could join! I‚Äôm open to online-only for now since getting around is a challenge or if you are in Montrose, Colorado, we can both checkout the newly opened Goodwill or you can text me (or I) and we‚Äôll still be friends even if I don‚Äôt reply for a month lol üòÇ I can teach you another language.

I'm a very anxious person in general. I have a psychotherapist and I'm dealing with this just with behavioral therapy. And I think it's good. 

Since many years I've experienced migraines right before the start pf my period almost. Especially while on the birth control pill which forced me to stop it. 

When I started levo (my diagnosis was subclinical hypothyroidism) I felt like i had more energy, instead of migraines I was having mild headache. In general, I regretted not having started with levo before. 

Now, last week I was preparing for an important event (a decisive interview). And took a day off to study for this (so no other activities I could do to change the topic in my head), so far so good, I do that when there's something important. 

On this day I was out and wanted to drink something warm. So I bought a cup of coffee and drank half of it. I have decaf coffee at home and drink maybe 3 times per week. So this is significantly more caffeine I've had in maybe 6 months. I stopped drinking coffee because I noticed that it affects my sleep. 


Continued studying. Around an hour later or perhaps before that I started feeling cold/warm sensation in my chest. Started noticing my heart beating. And dizzy. I bought a bottle of water and continued studying. Then after two hours of the coffee I started having a mild headache. Like the ones I've been having since levo (so not the migraines I used to get). So i continued studying even tho I didn't have that much time pressure (4 days later was the interview).

Then 4 hours later after the coffee the migraine started. Unbearable. Couldn't sleep. Took ibuprofen didn't help. What really helped was Sumatriptan (+500mg of naproxen)but i only took it one day because i only had one pill left and it usually works to stop it for good. The headache and migraine have been coming an going for 5 days (even after the interview). 

I just remembered one time where it lasted this long. I have a GP appointment for early next week to discuss about this issue. But I was just wondering if any of you have become more sensitive to coffee. 

I think my event was multifactorial. That is having a tendency to be super anxious, having a stressful event, having coffee after so kany months without it, and now being recently on levo.

I couldn't hold it in anymore(I wanted to slap the old hag but ofc I wouldnt) so I spat at her(the only option was to be sanskari or do what i did and my mom did beat me for it but was worth it).

And lemme tell you‚Äîit was a journey filled with caffeine, confusion, and a few *very* questionable life choices (like thinking I‚Äôd ""just skim the docs before bed"").

Here‚Äôs the wild ride in case it helps someone out there grinding for this beast of a cert:

**üìÖ Week 1: The Naive Optimist**  
I signed up thinking, ""Hey, I‚Äôve been messing with Azure at work, this‚Äôll be a breeze!""  
*Spoiler alert:* it was not.

Watched a few YouTube videos while half-paying attention. Got cocky. Tried a few questions and got smacked back to reality faster than my cat knocking over my coffee mug.

**üìÖ Week 2-3: The Panic Phase**  
This is when I realized Azure has more acronyms than my entire IT career. VMs, VNets, RBAC, NSGs‚Ä¶ I started dreaming about them. Like literal dreams. Nightmares, actually.

Started digging into Microsoft Learn, but that rabbit hole is **deeeep**. I needed structure. Like a toddler needs nap time.

**üí° Game Changer: Found Edusum**  
Randomly stumbled on Edusum‚Äôs AZ-104 practice tests. Didn‚Äôt expect much‚Ä¶ but whoa. These things were üî•.  
The format, the explanations, the fact that I could take them in my PJs while binge-eating chips at 2AM‚Äî*chef‚Äôs kiss*.

It wasn‚Äôt just about memorizing answers. The explanations actually made things click. Especially for stuff like storage accounts, role assignments, and those weird Access Review settings that nobody talks about.

**üìÖ Week 4: Confidence Mode Activated**  
Started scoring higher on Edusum practice exams. Began speaking in fluent Azure at work. My coworkers were like, ‚ÄúSince when do you know this stuff?‚Äù  
I said, ‚ÄúSince I‚Äôve been hanging out with Edusum more than with my own family.‚Äù

**üéâ Exam Day: I Survived**  
Was I nervous? Yep.  
Did I over-caffeinate? Also yep.  
But I passed! üèÜ

Not a perfect score, but good enough that I fist-bumped the air like I just hacked into NASA.

**TL;DR:**

* Don't underestimate AZ-104‚Äîit‚Äôs not just spinning up VMs.
* Use Microsoft Learn but *structure* it.

what‚Äôs the craziest, funniest, or most bizarre thing that‚Äôs happened to you in Grand Rapids? I‚Äôll kick it off with a personal story that still haunts me to this day.

Back in my senior year of high school, my friends and I decided to hit up Rumors. Were we 21? Absolutely not. Did we ‚Äúpre-game‚Äù irresponsibly in the parking lot with the cheapest liquor imaginable? Oh yeah. By the time we got inside, I was absolutely gone‚Ä¶dancing, talking to strangers, having the time of my life‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt.

At some point in the night, I got so drunk that I threw up all over this poor blonde girl at the bar. Full-on, no warning, just blegh right on her. Somehow, I wasn‚Äôt kicked out, but I knew I had to disappear immediately. I bolted out of there, never to be seen again‚Ä¶or so I thought.

Flash forward a few months. I‚Äôm a freshman at GVSU, and I start talking to this cute guy on Grindr. We set up a first date at a coffee shop hosting live poetry. super cute, right? We‚Äôre walking around downtown beforehand, really hitting it off, and as we‚Äôre about to head inside, I hear someone yell:

‚ÄúYou look so familiar!‚Äù

I turn around, smiling, trying to help her figure it out and she goes,

‚ÄúOh my god, you‚Äôre the guy who threw up all over me at Rumors!‚Äù

I just about died on the spot. Of all the people in this city, of all the possible moments, that night came back to haunt me right as I was having a great first date. Needless to say, the guy wasn‚Äôt interested in a second date for some reason.

I have plenty of other crazy stories, but I want to hear yours!",2,1743656509.0,grapids,0,1.0,False

**AIW for accusing girlfriend of cheating on me? (Found pregnancy test)**



So my girlfriend and I have been together for just under a year. We don‚Äôt live together and both work full time and we are exclusive, as far as I‚Äôm aware.

About a 3 months ago, I notice my girlfriend spending a lot of time on the phone with her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù Jesse. She says that Jesse is a good friend and that‚Äôs it. However she often spends anytime she can on the phone with him, even when her and I are out. Their conversations don‚Äôt lead me to think anything but about 1.5 months ago, my girlfriend says she‚Äôs going to visit Jesse who lives two states over. I can‚Äôt go cause I have to work.

Of course I tell her that I‚Äôm not comfortable with her visiting a male friend out of state but she says that Jesse is just a friend. She will be staying at his place but Jesse is also a single father of 2 young boys so my girlfriend assures me nothing will happen. Despite me voicing my opinion, my gf takes the trip and shares her location to put my mind at ease.

She returns a week later and we move on with life. However, about two weeks ago, my girlfriend asks me to go to our local Target to pick up an online order she had placed. She tells me she ordered shampoo and a few hygiene items. I agree and go to pick up her order. When I get to the customer service counter and give them her name, they bring out a bag with a pregnancy test in it. Shocked and confused, I tell them that this what she ordered. I check the name and phone number attached to the bag and find it matches my girlfriend‚Äôs number so it couldn‚Äôt have been another girl with the same name. They bring out the bag with the items she told me to get and I leave without asking more questions about the pregnancy test.

Shocked and confused by this cause there was no real way that I could have potentially impregnated her (we use protection) I later ask her why there was a pregnancy test at target in her name.

At first she says she has no idea and she did not order a pregnancy test. I asked her to show me her target app to prove it and she says that it was probably her sister since her sister uses her target account to order things sometimes. She also claims that women sometimes use pregnancy test to regulate their PMS or for other things other than to determine if they‚Äôre pregnant. I don‚Äôt know shit about how this works but she assures me that she‚Äôs not pregnant and that test wasn‚Äôt a sign of her cheating when she was on a trip. The other night we go out to dinner and she makes it a point to prove that she isn‚Äôt pregnant by ordering a few cocktails.

Am I wrong for accusing my girlfriend for cheating on me while she was away? I‚Äôm so paranoid but also don‚Äôt have real proof that she did.

Edit: needed to clarify the part about the pregnancy test .The pregnancy test was part of a separate online order. She asked me to pick up her online order at target which she said consisted of shampoo, deodorant and some lotion. When I went to the counter and told them her name, they brought out the bag with the pregnancy test. I said this isn‚Äôt what she told me was her order so they checked again and brought out the second bag with the right stuff as previously mentioned. After checking the info off both bags, I confirmed that both orders were under her name/account so I believe she secretly placed an online order for a pregnancy test and planned to get that later while asking me to get her shampoo. The pregnancy test was NOT in the same bag as the stuff she asked me to get.

Update: I never saw the pregnancy test after that so I don‚Äôt know if that truly was an order she made by mistake or if her sister used her target account to order that got herself. However I did bring up the fact that her sister lives about 20 minutes from her and has a target much closer to her so why would she place an order for a pregnancy test and have the pickup location further from her house? Even if her local target was all out, I find it hard to believe that her sister would order a pregnancy test under her account and pick it up near her house.

*Sure, the pregnancy test could have been placed in her order by error, but then she'd have just shown you the app to prove she didn't order it and wouldn't have blamed her sister.*

*She also wouldn't have lied about women using pregnancy tests to regulate PMS - this is absolutely not the truth and you should be insulted by this lie. The only thing pregnancy tests are used for is to determine if women are pregnant. That's it. She has changed the story like 5 times, and you want to believe her so much that you are starting to believe her.*

*Her having cocktails proves nothing except that the pregnancy test was negative.*

*She went to stay with Jesse despite your reservations about it, lied about the pregnancy test, and is making you think you are paranoid for thinking she cheated - without protection, probably.*



**ohmyyespls**

*women use birth control to regulate periods, not pregnancy tests.*



**No\_Coffee\_4339**

*The pregnancy test isn‚Äôt a sign of her cheating but her reasoning is. Pregnancy tests don‚Äôt regulate anything. Her changing stories and excuses are all you need to hear to know she is hiding something from you.*



**Update - 1 day later**



Thank you all for those that commented on my post yesterday concerning my girlfriend and my belief that she cheated on me.

TLDR: gf went to visit a male friend in a different state despite my protest. About a month later, I find out she secretly bought a pregnancy test. She claims she doesn‚Äôt know where it came from. I let it go and we move on.

So as an update, I realize that although my gf and i have protected sex, the chances of me getting her pregnant is possible. However, I strongly believe that despite our intimacy, I couldn‚Äôt have possibly impregnated my gf. Not to be disgusting and personal, but I NEVER ‚Äúfinish‚Äù inside of her because I want to reduce our chances of having kids until we‚Äôre both ready. That‚Äôs why when I saw the pregnancy test, I immediately thought she cheated on me.

Anyways I went into a panic last night after hearing all the comments and freaked out so I went to her apartment while she was at work (she gave me a key) and I found her iPad. I tried using her birthday as the password and to my amazement it worked. I immediately go through her messages and find evidence that she in fact had sex with her friend Jesse.

I‚Äôm honestly so devastated by this and I‚Äôve been such a nervous wreck since last night. I haven‚Äôt ate and I‚Äôve barely slept. Yes I know what I did, secretly going through her iPad and messages was wrong, but I had to know if she was cheating on me and if that pregnancy test she secretly order was cause Jesse may have knocked her up.

Now I‚Äôm waiting to confront her but I honestly don‚Äôt know how. How do I tell my gf that I know she cheated?

Am I wrong for going through her iPad and messages? Part of me feels wrong for this but you have no idea how much it hurts to know she did this. She was my first real gf in a long time and now I feel like an after thought.

Edit: as far as I know, she is NOT pregnant. She wanted to prove this by having a few cocktails when we went to to dinner last week. There‚Äôs no baby involved, thank god.

*Not wrong. The pregnancy test, and her preposterous answers to your questions about it, caused enough concern to do some digging. Just say to her ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù leave, and block.*



**Update - 3 days later**



TLDR version: gf took trip to see male friend but I later find out that she secretly bought a pregnancy test. Later found out through text messages that she has sex with him while on the trip.

So last night, I told my gf that I needed to talk to her. At first she kept saying she was busy but I insisted on seeing her in person so she finally said to go to her place around 8 pm.

I go over and I reiterated how eversince she got back from her trip, things have felt weird. She claims I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs making things weird by believing that she cheated on me. She continues to claim that the pregnancy test was not hers and that her friend Jesse was just a friend and they just hung out. I then proceed to tell her how I know she cheated because I saw the thread in her messages.

‚ÄúYou came here without me knowing and went through my personal messages? That‚Äôs so messed up and creepy to be honest.‚Äù She says. We got into a slight argument as I told her that my suspicions were correct and she was trying to deflect the conversation. I asked her to give me her phone and I‚Äôll show her all the messages I saw which were very clear and explicit. Of course she refuses and says ‚Äúwe are not married. We don‚Äôt live together. You don‚Äôt own or control me.‚Äù

While I agreed with her on that part, I decide to end things quickly and simply put her copy of her keys on her coffee table and tell her ‚Äúyou cheated. Plain and simple. Goodbye and good luck.‚Äù I walk out and she makes no attempt to stop me.

Later, she tries to text me and says that she‚Äôs sorry for what she did. At first, she claimed that Jesse was an old boyfriend that she never told me about and that they dated years ago before she met me and that he moved away several years ago. She claims that the messages I saw were old conversations they had but I quickly told her that was obviously not true. She swears that she didn‚Äôt mean to cheat and that Jesse must‚Äôve gotten her drunk and it lead to sex. She assures me that she is NOT pregnant with anyone‚Äôs baby.

I told her ‚Äúthat‚Äôs good cause I don‚Äôt want anything else tying me to you.‚Äù I wished her good luck again and I haven‚Äôt heard from her since.

Personally, I‚Äôm relieved but I‚Äôm so upset and devastated by all this. I spoke with my friend Eric who told me that he had an ex that cheated on him too but she later tried to contact him years later when the dude she cheated on him with turned out to be a bum. Hoping I can move forward from this. Thank you all for your input.

Am I wrong for anything I did or the way I acted in this?

I‚Äôve written and deleted this so many times unsure of whether or not to post it but I really don‚Äôt know what to do here. 

About 2 years ago,  I (28F) & my bf (29M) decided to let one of my oldest friends (26F) move into our home. The house that we live in is owned by my bf. It‚Äôs also important to add that on two separate occasions, he has wanted to kick her out and I have had her back & fought for her to stay when truthfully, he had very good reasons to want her out. Also, this friend was going through a rough breakup when I offered to have her move in so she could leave our home town and get a fresh start. Because she was an old friend of mine, we never had a written lease agreement in place. She just Venmo‚Äôd him rent every month. 

Well, back in January my bf and I had quite the fight. Our tenant was home and heard everything. Well.. I was working late one night & while I was away, the two of them spent hours talking shit about me. My bf told her that he didn‚Äôt know if he wanted to be with me anymore, and she told him that she was pretty sick of me too. He fucked up by ‚Äúventing‚Äù to her about it.. but she fucked up by feeding into it. Obviously I was wildly betrayed by BOTH of them. 

My bf and I patched things up, but I noticed that she started treating me VERY coldly - and oddly enough? She was being extra nice to him. Like over the top friendly with him out of nowhere. She told me directly that if we ended up breaking up that she was going to remain living in his house. After that she went SIX WEEKS without saying a word to me. When I tried talking to her, she was super short with me. I hadn‚Äôt done anything to her. 

I had made multiple remarks to my bf about her cold shouldering me, he brushed them off. I finally asked my bf if she had said anything to him about me and he decided to tell me the details of the discussion they had following our last fight. He was honest about what he had said to her, he also shared what she had to say about me too. She kept telling him that she was annoyed I had someone to support me and she didn‚Äôt not. She felt like I have been rubbing my success, happiness, vacations, and relationship in her face and she was resenting me for it. I was devastated. I felt like they had both betrayed me in such a dirty way. He shouldn‚Äôt be involving her as a) another woman, b) my best friend and c) our roommate. If she were truly my friend, she shouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable speaking poorly about me to my bf ESPECIALLY when she knows we‚Äôre fighting. If she were really my friend, she would have told him to leave her out of it. At this point I decided to completely detach from her. I stopped trying to talk to her, be friendly with her, really stopped trying period. From this point, the entire dynamic of our house has shifted. The vibe was already off with her cutting me off and them getting weirdly friendly together, but once I had the full story I had no desire to be friends with her anymore period. Towards the end of February, she cornered me in the kitchen and said ‚Äúwell you clearly have an issue. We gonna talk about it?‚Äù In such an accusatory tone that I had the ick and just told her ‚Äúall good.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to throw my bf under the bus for telling me all the shit she had said about me and honestly, I had such a shitty week with medical issues, grieving the loss of a pet, and had recently wrecked my car so I did not have the mental or emotional capacity to deal with her anyways at that time. (lol. What a fucking month.) 

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago. She is away for the weekend and my bf and I are talking in the garage. He tells me that he‚Äôs tired of the house feeling off and us not getting along. She had been texting him privately and asking him to meet her in his car, etc. to talk because she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know why I was pulling away from her.‚Äù She played him like a goddamn fiddle. She tried to flip it around like she hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong and I was the only one with a problem. He told me that he wants me to ‚Äúfix things‚Äù with her so she doesn‚Äôt move out. I lost it. Chat üëèüèºI üëèüèº LOST üëèüèº ITüëèüèº I told him that we wouldn‚Äôt be in this mess if he hadn‚Äôt brought her into things and made her feel comfortable with disrespecting me. I wasn‚Äôt in the wrong for no longer trying to be friendly when she never should have talked poorly about me to him. He had no right making this mess then being upset that our home was still messy. He‚Äôs not usually a man who‚Äôs willing to hear his role in things (a whole other issue he‚Äôs working on) but he actually listened to me and responded with full accountability. He told me that the only reason he decided to talk to her about it was because he didn‚Äôt want to tell anyone that was ‚Äúactually important‚Äù we had been having issues because he ultimately knew he wanted to work things out he was just angry. We decided together that he was going to talk to her and establish that she is not to be cold towards me & I should be respected as his girlfriend & lady of the house - his words. I told him that I would have a conversation with her and be blunt about my reasons for no longer trying to be her friend- ultimately throwing him under the bus for telling me the poor things she said about me during such a vulnerable time. He talked to her that same day for close to an hour, the next week she texted me asking to meet for coffee. 

I was upfront when we met. Told her that I knew what she had said about me and if she was truly a friend she wouldn‚Äôt ever allow my bf to talk about me like that and then take it as an opportunity to kick me while I‚Äôm down too. All she had to say was ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm not saying those things WEREN‚ÄôT said but maybe he took them out of context.‚Äù In regards to her being distant with me, she said she was trying to give us both space, which is total bs. I brought up specific examples of her practically running into the other room to hang out with my bf anytime he wasn‚Äôt with me. She said that it was actually HIM being overly friendly with HER, and she didn‚Äôt have anything to do with it. I literally watched this play out, I‚Äôm not buying it. She basically tried to pin the whole thing on him. She then also tried some ‚Äúladies should stick together‚Äù shit and said she didn‚Äôt feel as if she could trust him anymore after he told me what she had to say ‚Äúin private‚Äù about me. Also tried bringing up specific things he had said about me that would be particularly hurtful for me to hear. She kept saying she missed hanging out with me and really thought our friendship was stronger than to let a man get in the middle of it. At no point did she ever own her role in this. By the time we left the coffee shop, we didn‚Äôt really have any answers. I told her I didn‚Äôt really know what to think and she agreed. 

Well. The two of them never really stopped having private discussions. They stopped using our house group chat for matters involving the whole home. My relationship with my bf has been well, we‚Äôre repairing things and working towards a beautiful future. But I can‚Äôt get over how uncomfortable I feel towards her and her oddly close and exclusive friendship towards him that blossomed at a time when she knew our relationship was in a rough spot.

She announced today (privately, to my bf) that she is moving out at the end of April and now my bf is angry with me saying it‚Äôs all my fault. He is now completely refusing to own his role in the mess and saying it‚Äôs my ‚Äúbad attitude‚Äù that ‚Äúpushed her out‚Äù. I really want things to work out with him but this has been such an ugly uphill battle in which I was completely abandoned and betrayed by the two people who meant the most to me. AIO?

So a friend of mine who has dreamed of her wedding since she was a child is finally engaged. She has asked me to be a bridesmaid soon as she was engaged. I didn‚Äôt want to be rude and spoil her dreams by saying no since her maid of honour she originally asked said no right away. so I immediately said yes. Even though  part of me wanted to just be a guest. I am so happy her dreams are coming true and truly happy she gets her big day. But I know how much work,TIME and money it cost to be in a wedding. 

While she is being so reasonable about how much we are paying for the dress and not making us pay for hair and make up, we are doing our own. Seems to be pretty minimal on decorations and ‚Äúcrafting‚Äù up things for the wedding. The bachelorette party is simple restaurant and going out on a family boat. So again all really easy going laid back event. 
So where I am wondering if I am being the asshole or if she is just obsessing begins here. 

Since she got engaged March 2024 and the Wedding planed for Aug 2025 we haven‚Äôt talked about much of anything else. She immediately started a group chat with the bridesmaid and I kid you not post every other day with ideas, plans and there have been many. We are now 4 months out from the day and she just recently decided that a restaurant and boat ride is easiest. So many elaborate plans that would have been costly were discussed. The group of girls she has in the bridal party are all stay at home
moms so our funds are pretty minimal. So this is my issues. 
Since after Christmas it‚Äôs truly been all about the wedding. We don‚Äôt talk about anything else. If I try to mention anything about my life or what‚Äôs going on she fades out. Looks at her phone or will literally walk away like ‚Äúoh I need to go pee‚Äù She might listen enough for me to finish my sentence but then it‚Äôs right back to ‚Äúanyways I am ordering this or what‚Äôs should I do about this‚Äù . It‚Äôs obsessive. I don‚Äôt even want to go over for a coffee anymore because it‚Äôs draining to listen to only her wedding plans. There‚Äôs no talk about our kids or life or any current events just wedding. 
So my question is do I just ride it out and let her talk my ear off and make my visits minimal or do I say something? I don‚Äôt want to be rude or hurt her feelings I know how important it is and how much she has dreamed of this day. I on the other hand never was they type to fantasize about my wedding. How would you approach this? 
What would you say or not say? Just let it be 4 months will pass quickly. I just feel annoyed. ",11,1743656057.0,bridezillas,7,0.92,False

She was one of the most broke customers who always got mad and threw a fit and always accused me of purposely messing with the system. No dumbass, it's because the Cash App ""overdraft"" counts as goddamn credit, and our card reader does NOT process credit cards. ""Where are you going to now, I heard _____ is hiring!"" Pfft, why would I wanna work there, so you can come find me and harass me more?

Gotta get my shit from the Amazon locker? Here comes a male family of three with awful hygiene and trashy mannerisms. They just reek of stale cigarettes and weed. They see me from the furthest point across the lawn and start screaming my name. I can't STAND extra attention so I try my hardest to just hurry and scurry back to my apartment before they can get to me. They always catch up. They always wanna talk. They always ALWAYS want to beg me to smoke. No. I'm going back to my unit to smoke with my partner. Please leave me alone. ""Where are you going to now, I heard _____ is hiring!"" Pfft, why would I wanna work there, so you can come find me and harass me more?

- oh but not before the weirdo who kept asking for my number does this stupid shit where he ""pretends"" his dog got loose and sends her after me. No, I'm not single. No, I'm not interested. Hell no, I don't want a drink. Please go away and leave me alone. ""Awww, but where are you going to now, I heard _____ is hiring!"" Pfft, why would I wanna work there, so you can come find me and harass me more?

Going to the corner store. I figure ""aw hell it's early. It'll be fine."" Nope. All the old heads are in there with their giant stacks of scratchers and the overpowering stench of old man funk and stale beer. ""Hey hey where the hell have you been? Your boss better give you a spanking, I haven't been able to get in and buy anything from you guys in weeks! What are you doing out anyway, shouldn't you be working?"" Like first off fuck you, second off the place has been SHUT DOWN. CLOSED. PERMANENTLY. Ffs I'm tired of repeating myself.  ""Where are you going to now, a huh huh I heard _____ is hiring!"" Pfft, why would I wanna work there, so you can come find me and harass me more?

Corner store, but make it late. Now the crazies and hellbent ""mombies"" are out. I had a homeless customer who used to urinate on our building grab me by my wrist today while I was trying to walk in (just needed coffee creamer) and go ""hey pretty thang, where you been at?"" I instantly jerked my hand away and yelled that the place has been shut down for weeks. Dude just laughs because....he's nuts. He oftentimes yells at nothing in the sky. I get inside and a ghetto Mombie looks up from her giant smartphone for a second and snaps her nails at me ""aw hell naw bitch, you been gone too long. Where the fuck am I supposed to buy my shit at now???"" Like fuck you, that's not my fucking problem.  ""Where are you going to now, I heard _____ is hiring!"" Pfft, why the fuck would I wanna work there, so you can come find me and harass me more?

Icing on the cake. The corner store was out of something I needed. So I had to cross the street and go to another one. I run into a very stinky and smelly ex customer who immediately insists on standing super close and I want to cry vomit because he STINKS. I wrap up convo, go to the counter to pay. He follows me. I'm paying and rolling my eyes because he's still just fucking TALKING at me about his new place, fresh bedding, what have you. I turn and make eye contact to get ready to tell him off but I freak out because he keeps following. I'm like sprinting back across the street to go the hell back home and he's just....following and asking if I drive or walk everywhere and I'm just like ""ffs please fuck off!"" Again the same fucking phrase.  ""Where are you going to now, I heard _____ is hiring!"" Pfft, why would I wanna work there, for the love of God it's like they want to just outright say ""I'm going to stalk you until I find out where you're working next so I can give you a hard time again. 

I just hate people. I've been out of work for two weeks and not one day has been fully relaxing because it's a small town and I can't avoid the thousands of people I served at my last job.

Weather changes are only one of my triggers though and I still have no clue what all the triggers are - after 30 years.

Most of the time pills containing caffeine would work.

After stumbling into this sub I quit caffeine altogether.
No chocolate, no coffee, no sodas, no headache pills containing caffeine. 

Today is day 90 of this experiment.

Unfortunately I have to report that I still get headaches - same frequency (about 1 a week lasting 24h - 36h)

While the experiment was going I tried to alleviate them with caffeine-free headache pills (ibuprofen or paracetamol). These pills did not really help much.

Today I had a headache once again - right away when waking up in the morning. I could not do it anymore.

I took a pill containing 100mg caffeine and after 45 minutes the headache is completely gone.

I must say that my heart did not react as well as my head though, since I feel very ""wired"" (heart racing a bit).

Not sure what to do with this. I guess I will still try to abstain from caffeine for most of the time since I think I felt calmer and also I never liked the addiction to coffee anyway.

1jq9fyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1jq9fyp/lets_be_real_castorice_and_her_global_passive_is/,Let's be real. Castorice and her Global Passive is not a big deal,"GLOBAL PASSIVE

It really isn't. I mean the global passive is only a 1HP rez. And most likely in endgame, if you get hit that KO you, and you get auto rez'd, you still need to get to your turn before you can heal or shield. Half the time you could get whacked before then and then your charcter is dead again.

And if you're dying in endgame and need a rez in the first place, then you need to look at how your teams are built. Anyone who's been playing for 1yr+ or since the beginning should have a decent number of characters by now and should at the very least be able to make it to the end of any endgame content without dying.

The only people who wouldn't be able to are really anyone who's been playing for less than 6 months and then in that case  castorice is worth pulling for since they would probably need a bigtime DPS, plus the 1HP rez would help them until a time they don't need it anymore. Remember Bailu in early game? Quickly abandoned once you were able to survive without dying for better healers or shielders. 

And if you think global passives will come thick and fast, i would beg to differ. The last time a game changing character dropped was probably Acheron at last year's anniversary. So Castorice being a game changer happened 1 yr later. If they do introduce another global passive character it probably won't happen until next year.

Let's say they do introduce another global passive character. Will it really change your game? At most it's going to be a 10% buff. will 10% atk or 10%crit really make that much of a difference for you? If it does, then I'd suggest you look at your team builds and team comps and rework them instead.

POWERCREEP

I'll admit you can tell that older characters don't exactly keep up with the newer characters. my Silver wolf, jingliu, kafka, blade, seele are all there collecting dust on the bench. But it's not like you've become a monk and stopped pulling for characters. If you've been playing the game you would have collected stellar jade to pull for someone every couple of banners or so. On average there should be at least 80 or 90 pulls per patch.

F2P

And for those calling this stuff all predatory and all. THE GAME IS FREE! IT COSTS YOU ZERO DOLLARS TO PLAY. It's like someone walking up to you and giving you a free Mcdonald's meal, and then you look at them and say "" Why didn't you give me the Large meal with extra nuggets?"" I mean come on. If it were a full priced game like AC Shadows or Call of Duty then yes you can complain about the monetisation of things.

But it doesn't cost you a single cent to play this game. I'll admit I got one of the smaller shard packets  for Firefly (I mean she's in a freaking Robot suit!) But that was in June. And since then I've pulled the following

Sept- Feixiao, Robin

Dec - Sunday

Feb- Aglaea + LC

And I haven't spent a single cent since. If I were going to spend i'd get the monthly pass as that's the most bang for your buck and it's literally the price of a starbucks coffee or boba drink once a month. Surely you could go one day a month without Starbucks or boba for some extra pulls if you really like the game. 

At the end of the day you don't need to pull on every banner each time it comes around. If you really like their design then go for it! But i'm still running a pela with Acheron in MOC. I've still got baby herta twirling in Pure Fiction. and I'm still getting 35/36*. 

I'm going to pull for Castorice not because of the global passive, or that she seems like a meta DPS, but because SHE CALLS A DRAGON TO RIP THE FABRICS OF TIME AND SPACE TO RAIN HELLFIRE DOWN ON THE ENEMIES.

If that's not peak anime then I don't know what is.

I knew when I applied that I'd be answering phones and talking to people. I had no ideas how draining it would be. I currently work nights at a hotel, and I've worked three customer service jobs before this; one front desk, one retail, and one restaurant. 

For some reason, the customers I deal with at the hotel are some of the most bloated, incompetent humans I've ever seen in my life. Before I get into why, please don't say ""this would be good for r/askhotels, r/talesfromthefrontdesk, or r/hotels."" No. No it would not be. I would get torn apart there. Everyone in those subreddits just love their jobs, and anyone who doesn't revolve their life around working front desk is the problem. 

Anyway, I hate talking to them in person or on the phone. I hate when they ask for things when they should be asleep. And don't get me started on people who just ""hang out"" in the lobby. Can't you be fat and stupid somewhere else?The sound of their voice, ESPECIALLY the throat clearing, or their footsteps or their stupid suitcases rolling towards the desk physically makes my chest tighten. 

I hate how dumb they are. ""Can I get a wake up call?"" What I'm hearing is ""I, a 45 year old man, cannot rely on myself to get up on time, so I'm going to rely on a few strangers to wake me up."" Or ""what time is breakfast?"" What I observe is you didn't bother to look around you for signs or bother to read the little pamphlets you got with your keys. 

There is one group of guests that I hate so much that I wouldn't care if one dropped dead in front of me. Sports parents. They come every weekend and drink themselves silly in the dining room. All the while their kids run around the hotel, ding dong ditching and scattering crumbs down the hallway. Management is aware of this and tells us not to intervene, as they ""paid for the use of that space"" When the sports parents stay up really late and are loud or messy, I always make them decaf coffee the next morning. I know there is a small possibility of the entire family crashing on the way back home, and that thought brings me immense joy. Even so, I make them deaf coffee on mornings after the parents are disrespectfully loud or messy.  I seriously would not give two fucks if the whole family crashed and died. To be honest, I would probably celebrate. Again, I don't wish death on all customers, just the sports parents. Other guests still piss me off just by existing in my vicinity, though.

They tried to invite me for coconut roti (flatbread) for breakfast, as always. I declined, just wanted to see the sea and had to get back home.

I listened to Tracy Chapman's first album in my headphones. Yes I am millenial, but you should all hear her, she sings about you too. She never gets old.

The canal I crossed on my way back had this faint stagnant water smell, like drains left blocked. All along the rails, there was fresh laundry. Women here do not sleep in. 

I passed a Catholic cemetery, and there was this life sized military guy on one of the tombs, and it reminded me of how fragile peace is, and how civil war tore this country apart. I used to drive military aid in Ukraine, so it hit home. I did not call my friends back there in a month, as I don't want to know if anyone died since last.

I came back to our neighbourhood. I lit three incense sticks at the banyan tree Buddhist shrine. One for Vishnu (my fianc√©'s choice), one for Kali (the one that called me), and one, of course, for Buddha. I placed my white flowers with the others. The Gods like pretty things, and it's sort of a lottery. If we don't pray to them, they lose power,  and can't perform miracles anymore. I'm happy to give if it makes someone else recieve.

Next to the shrine, a neighbour lady has a stall where she sells short eats - like small cooked snacks, sweet breads and all. I bought a wade (a lentil donut sort of) filled with coconut sambol (grated pounded coconut with spices, lime juice and dried tuna). Her daughter was in the shed too, a three year old girl with an amulet to ward off the evil eye, pierced ears - and I said she was beautiful, because she was. Her big sister handed her over to me without asking, like here, have the baby, but the baby didn't mind, thankfully.

I went back home, and ground urad dal and rice for the idli (steamed rice cake) I'm gonna do for dinner. My mixie is pretty bad, it cost like $7, so it took some time. I had to chill the engine part in the fridge for a while, and then let it steam off for 15 minutes so it wouldn't collapse from the condensed water. 

My fianc√© is still sleeping, but when he wakes up (he works California hours) I will cook omelet for him.",1,1743654517.0,ordinarylifes,0,1.0,False

I knew when I applied that I'd be answering phones and talking to people. I had no ideas how draining it would be. I currently work nights at a hotel, and I've worked three customer service jobs before this; one front desk, one retail, and one restaurant. 

For some reason, the customers I deal with at the hotel are some of the most bloated, incompetent humans I've ever seen in my life. Before I get into why, please don't say ""this would be good for r/askhotels, r/talesfromthefrontdesk, or r/hotels."" No. No it would not be. I would get torn apart there. Everyone there absolutely loves their job and anyone who doesn't love working front desk is the problem. 

Anyway, I hate talking to them in person or on the phone. I hate when they ask for things when they should be asleep. And don't get me started on people who just ""hang out"" in the lobby. Can't you be fat and stupid somewhere else?The sound of their voice, ESPECIALLY the throat clearing, or their footsteps or their stupid suitcases rolling towards the desk physically makes my chest tighten. 

I hate how dumb they are. ""Can I get a wake up call?"" What I'm hearing is ""I, a 45 year old man, cannot rely on myself to get up on time, so I'm going to rely on a few strangers to wake me up."" Or ""what time is breakfast?"" What I observe is you didn't bother to look around you for signs or bother to read the little pamphlets you got with your keys. 

There is one group of guests that I hate so much that I wouldn't care if one dropped dead in front of me. Sports parents. They come every weekend and drink themselves silly in the dining room. All the while their kids run around the hotel, ding dong ditching and scattering crumbs down the hallway. Management is aware of this and tells us not to intervene, as they ""paid for the use of that space"" When the sports parents stay up really late and are loud or messy, I always make them decaf coffee the next morning. I know there is a small possibility of the entire family crashing on the way back home, and that thought brings me immense joy. Even so, I make them deaf coffee on mornings after the parents are disrespectfully loud or messy.  I seriously would not give two fucks if the whole family crashed and died. To be honest, I would probably celebrate. Again, I don't wish death on all customers, just the sports parents. Other guests still piss me off just by existing in my vicinity, though. That being said, I still do my best to provide them with good service. 

Surely there is someone else out there who has experienced this feeling. I'm just burnt out and don't want to do anything that involves other humans. I'm still in college so my career choices are pretty limited at the moment. ",2,1743654487.0,hatemyjob,0,1.0,False

I wake up sometime between 10-2pm, I drink my coffee in bed in the dark, mindlessly consuming Youtube videos even though I'm ""taking a social media break"". I force myself to go to the gym so I can say I've left the house, and force myself to not look for your Jeep on the road.

What a hypocrite I am.

I don't want you to see me like this. I don't want¬†*anyone*¬†to see me like this. But the truth is that anyone who actually knows me well would not be surprised that I've locked myself here, a prisoner in my own mind yet again. Anyone who actually knows me well would understand what I've been through makes me do this, as much as I truly despise it.

I've tried so many times to fly away from this oppressive feeling, and it feels like each time I've failed to do so, more feathers are ripped out, making each subsequent escape attempt that much harder.

I realize that for a time, you broke me out of this. You truly brought me back to life. I had just made another escape attempt, one that seemed like maybe,¬†*just maybe,*¬†this would be it.

And there you were. You listened to every philosophical ""revelation"" I'd ever come to in my extended isolation. Because it really had become life or death for me. I had come to agree with Camus that the fundamental question for any human being to answer was whether all of this was truly worth it or not. I had to reconcile losing my dad to the absurdity, and find a way to persist having seen its face so young. The Abyss had very much already looked back into me at that point. You listened as I tearfully exclaimed, ""you're the universe looking back at itself""- a moment that I'm not sure whether to cherish, or cringe about now.

The truth is that I've become bitter and angry. I don't see much of the softness in myself that I had tried really, really hard to keep anymore. My soul- if any of us truly have one- is truly fucking tired. My latest escape attempt failed, and I'm back in my childhood house- back with the ghosts, back where so much blood was spilled- and not only mine.

I remember you running your fingers over my scars while we were in bed- the reason I didn't wear short sleeves for about 6 years, until the literal day I turned 18 and was able to tattoo over them. I had truly forgotten that they were a feature on my body until your touch reminded me that my arm had it's own topography.

You said that you've seen the Abyss too, tried to let it take you before, so maybe none of this scares you. But I told you recently I was struggling, and you were kind enough to respond, but you didn't ask why or what was going on. Maybe it's selfish for me to ask you to throw me a rope to help pull me out. But that's all I want. Because you made me believe for a time that maybe, I could fly with these broken wings. But I can't reach out to you again after that. You just...don't want me.

I'm sorry I blamed you, said that you should've known better. But again, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to believe about what happened here. I can't ignore the possibility that you sniffed the girl with obvious daddy issues out. Or that you met up with me again in October only out of pity, which would be worse.

But with the way I've been, maybe I am a thing to be pitied. Because if you were to text me right now, I would still meet you in any parking lot. Or at least a coffee to start.

But I need to accept that none of that is going to happen.",2,1743654316.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

I have extremely sensitive combination skin, and lots of triggers that come with it, arguably the biggest one being sugar. However, I recently started working out, eating better, and cut out a lot of my sugar intake. The only sugar I really consume on a daily basis is my morning coffee (which has creamer and caramel drizzle on it). My skin was looking the best it has in a very long time, but the past few days it has broke out the worst it ever has. I can only think of one thing that would make it break out like this, and it is a moisturizer I switched to since it is getting warmer where I live. During the winter, my skin gets so incredibly dry and most moisturizers I‚Äôve tried make my skin burn terribly, eventually I found one that worked well for me. However now that it is getting warmer out, it is making my skin oily. I switched to the Vanicream one which I believe I used last summer and that was the only thing I changed in my routine recently. I am breaking out in areas that I never do (chin, nose, forehead). I just don‚Äôt understand how it could be this moisturizer when I‚Äôm pretty sure I used the exact same type last summer, but it is the only thing I can think it is. Does this look like a product breakout, or something else?

Developers, we launched our app this past week and we are looking for users to give it a try. Any and all constructive feedback is very appreciated. Longer explanation regarding the issue we are trying to improve and our key differentiators is below:

Tired of the same old dating apps that feel like an endless grind?¬†**Ghosting, swiping fatigue, and conversations that go nowhere?**¬†We‚Äôve all been there. That‚Äôs why we built¬†**Splash Match**, an¬†**anti-swipe**¬†dating app designed to actually get you on dates.

For years, Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble have made dating feel like a frustrating numbers game.¬†**We‚Äôre over it, and so are you.**¬†Here‚Äôs how Splash Match is changing things:

# üéì Built by Recent Indiana University Grads Who Get It

We‚Äôre¬†**recent IU grads**¬†who spent years watching the dating app scene get worse and worse.

‚ùå¬†**Swipe culture is exhausting.**  
‚ùå¬†**Conversations rarely go anywhere.**  
‚ùå¬†**People feel like they‚Äôre stuck in a loop of bad matches.**

We‚Äôve been through the¬†**same frustrations as you**‚Äîso we decided to¬†**build a better way to meet people.**¬†Whether it‚Äôs¬†**more transparency, more fun, or more chances to actually connect,**¬†we designed Splash Match to make dating feel¬†**real again.**

# üî• A Smarter, More Transparent Algorithm

Ever wonder why you‚Äôre seeing the same faces over and over? Or if an algorithm is secretly ranking you?¬†**We‚Äôre done with the mystery.**

üí°¬†**Category Alignment Qui**z ‚Äì When you join, you‚Äôll take a short quiz that helps align you with like-minded people. Our algorithm uses this info to¬†**curate your potential matches transparently‚Äîno shadowy ranking, no black box**.  
üîç¬†**You Won‚Äôt Know Which Categories You Aligned O**n ‚Äì It‚Äôs all about organic discovery. Once you match, you can explore shared interests naturally.

# üíï Friday Night Virtual Speed Dating ‚Äì A Modern Ode to Omegle

Remember the thrill of¬†**Omegle**¬†or the¬†**old-school speed dating days?**¬†We‚Äôre bringing that back.

‚è≥¬†**Every Friday at 8 PM (your local time),**¬†Splash Match hosts a¬†**one-hour speed dating event.**¬†Here‚Äôs how it works:  
üí¨¬†**1.5-minute text conversation**s with singles in your area.  
üìá¬†**Interested? Share your contact card**.  
üôÖ¬†**Not feeling it? No problem. Next chat**.  
üöÄ¬†**Meet tons of new people in a short tim**e ‚Äì Plus, you might bump into them¬†**IRL when you hit the town later**.

No awkward texting. No ghosting. Just real-time, low-pressure conversations.

# üí∞ Affordable, Fair, and Gamified Subscriptions

Dating apps shouldn‚Äôt drain your wallet.

‚òï¬†**Splash Match‚Äôs subscription is cheaper than your daily name-brand coffee.**  
üéÆ¬†**Gamified experience**: Even if you‚Äôre on the basic plan, you can earn coins¬†**just by being activ**e‚Äîwhich you can spend on premium features.

Long story short, I deleted all dating apps AND my profiles about 3/4 months ago. I‚Äôve had them on and off since I was 18, but one day I just woke up and thought‚Ä¶ this is embarrassing. They‚Äôve never really worked for me ‚Äîespecially as a plus sized woman. Seven years and nothing? Come on, time to shut the program down. I will say I‚Äôve had some dates and talked to people, but I‚Äôve never gotten anything long term from it like I  always wanted. 

So, I deleted them. 

At the same time and prior, I started doing things where I might meet people organically: going to a weekly trivia night, a monthly bingo night, joining a ‚ÄúYoung Adults‚Äù group in my city, going out downtown once or twice to bars a month. Generally, I‚Äôm also out and about I feel like! I work remote from coffee shops often. I have other places I cycle through as a regular for shopping, thrifting, group dinners with the ‚ÄúYoung Adults‚Äù group‚Ä¶ long story short I haven‚Äôt really met anyone organically either. I‚Äôve been trying for about 6 months. I did actually meet a guy tbh, but upon getting to know him further we are not compatible. After that, I‚Äôm noticing a lot of people at the trivia, bingo, and dinners are the same regulars too. UGH! 

It‚Äôs making me feel like I need to get back on the apps! But there‚Äôs something in me that really tells me not to. It feels like a temporary fix. 

Idk. Not really looking for advice because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to download the apps. I‚Äôm going to try and stay strong. I‚Äôll start volunteering somewhere and see if anything comes from that! I just wanted to say something because I‚Äôm sure other people may feel the same way. ",2,1743653817.0,women,0,1.0,False
