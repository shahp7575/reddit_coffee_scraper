Very nice, pretty quiet fella. B doesn’t ask for much, but other CNAs in my facility seem like they don’t like him very much. He’ll press his call light and it will be one they answer last because they think he presses it too much. (note: B presses his call light maybe twice a shift, way less than many others) Its usually not for anything important, but damn. Once he pressed it to ask for coffee, I answered and went to get him some and on my way out his door he says “be careful!! I don’t want you to burn yourself, take your time” and I literally wanted to bawl. Hes like that all the time with me, so I can’t fathom anyone not liking him. I always tell him goodnight when I’m leaving, and he grabs my hand for a moment and says goodnight back. The only possible annoyance from him ever is sometimes he will repeatedly ask you to take him to his room (part of his care plan requires him to stay in the social areas) and he gets very concerned about not knowing where his room is, but he’s never mean and just needs a little reassurance you will take him there when you can. I will say he does probably treat me nicer than other CNAs because the favoritism between us is mutual, I am definitely his favorite. He says I make the best coffee (regardless of how I make it, sometimes I forget he likes 2 sugars 2 creamers and bring him black coffee and he drinks it without complaint).  He’s a major choking risk but I feel like everyone should get the opportunity to have a snack between a meal if they want it, so if he is interested I usually sit with him while he eats a cookie or something (during a slow period in the day, he’s patient) because he’s not allowed to eat in his room by himself.

I’m looking for recommendations for a Facebook group where families can find nannies — but ideally one that truly advocates for both sides, not just one. I absolutely believe in paying caregivers what they’re worth, especially when they’re experienced, responsible, and genuinely engaged with the kids. That said, I’d love to find a group where rates are more thoughtfully discussed — based on a nanny’s background, approach to care, and value they bring — not just the idea that “nanny care is a luxury” or “I’ve been nannying for 10 years, so I charge $30/hour.”

I say this with full respect and as someone who has been on both sides — I’ve worked in daycares, I’ve nannied, babysat, and now I work professionally in my career. I went to school for 4 years, I continue to grow in my field, and I earn just a little over $30/hour. So when I’m paying someone $20–$30/hour — which is a professional wage — I expect a level of care that matches that: structure, engagement, development, not just supervision.

And while I’ve had fantastic nannies who absolutely deserved top rates, I’ve also experienced the opposite. Too often I’ve seen nannies who take kids out, meet up with other nannies, grab coffee, sit on a bench chatting — and barely interact with the children. In those situations, the kids aren’t really learning or being engaged — it becomes more of a social outing for the nanny than a developmental experience for the child. Meanwhile, parents are at work, completely unaware, assuming they’re paying for personalized care that’s better than daycare — when in reality, sometimes daycare may offer more structure and stimulation.

What also concerns me is how often rates are adjusted for “cost of living” every 6 months in some groups, as if everyone’s care level or responsibilities automatically change. Most of us in traditional jobs don’t get raises that often unless there’s a significant change in performance or role.

So I’m really just looking for a group — or a conversation — that reflects both sides honestly. One that values great caregivers (and I know there are many), but also understands that not all care is equal, and not every nanny justifies $30/hour simply because they’ve been in the field for a while.

If you know of a group like this or have thoughts, I’d really appreciate hearing from you. My goal is always to give my child the best care — and make fair, informed decisions.

1l5ampm,https://i.redd.it/trehpwr76f5f1.jpeg,Carajillo Mead,"Hey everyone wanted to share my second batch of Mead that turned out great. I tried to do a spin on a Carajillo flavor (espresso and liquor 43 cocktail)

I did a lot of reading from the group to figure out how to impart a coffee flavor into my Mead and glad to say it worked out great! 

Here's how I did it so that you all can try for yourselves. 

Recipe:
3 gallon carboy
6lbs of Mesquite honey (previous coffee Meads recommended dark honey variants)
2 gallons of water
1 mango jack M05 yeast
Starting SG 1.09
Ferment for 5 weeks, I achieved a final SG of .994 for a 14.5% alcohol content. 

Siphon to next Carboy for secondary
Add potassium sorbate and potassium metabisulfate to end the yeast
Next place carboy in fridge and let it cool overnight. From here we are doing a cold brew with the mead. Grab 12oz of your favorite medium roast as whole beans (others stated that ground beans will impart more bitterness into the Mead) place it into the Mead with a brewers bag. I found that 5 days added a great amount of coffee flavor but did not over power the mead. 

Final step is adding the liquor 43 to match the Carajillo flavor. In the cocktail it's 1 to 1 ratio espresso vs liquor. The liquor itself is very sweet so this brought back the sweetness into the Mead. Doing a lot of testing of working up the amount of liquor 43 to Mead ratio, I found the sweet spot at 1mL to 14.6mL. if you add too little you make all the flavor mute and the Mead is very bland, if you add to much you get a sweeter mead and lose some of the nice caramels and vanillas from the mesquite honey. So I found this to be the perfect ratio. I had 7884mL of Mead and added 540mL of liquor 43. Rounded out the full alcohol percentage to be 15.5%

Overall this is a great attempt and a unique drink. If you are a fan of espresso martinis the Carajillo is a close cousin. This Mead is still truly a mesquite mead but has a nice espresso flavor journey in the middle followed by nice long caramel vanilla and light coffee after tastes. ",1,1749264754.0,mead,1,1.0,False

The nook also acts as my bed, which I dress up with sheets at night. I'm not that tall so I can comfortably squeeze in at night. What really makes the room pop in my opinion, is the projector. I can put virtually any scene, video or movie on the wall to fit whatever aesthetic I am feeling in that moment. Youtube has some awesome window projections that I use often.

The next day i had a birthday party to go to and the plan was for Andrea to leave. but she insisted on staying with my sister. i thought it was weird but i said yes thinking she would leave. she stayed for four more days where they hung out in my room, slept in my bed, went on my roof, and used stuff in my room. they left food everywhere, and the next time Andrea came over they watched a movie in my bedroom. i eventually asked Andrea if we could talk about it because i felt so frustrated. i told her how my sister and i don't have a good relationship and i wasn't comfortable with how they used all my things without asking. Andrea was at the gym at the time, and i later found out my sister was there as well. Andrea read my whole text to my sister where i was literally talking about our relationship.

The next day i had a birthday party to go to and the plan was for Andrea to leave. but she insisted on staying with my sister. i thought it was weird but i said yes thinking she would leave. she stayed for four more days where they hung out in my room, slept in my bed, went on my roof, and used stuff in my room. they left food everywhere, and the next time Andrea came over they watched a movie in my bedroom. i eventually asked Andrea if we could talk about it because i felt so frustrated. i told her how my sister and i don't have a good relationship and i wasn't comfortable with how they used all my things without asking.

I recently found out my cousin is getting married in two months in a different country and I told my work that I would like to have two weeks off and they said that is very unlikely so I asked for one week off and they said no again. Just wondering what you guys would do in the situation I really like this job but I also want to visit my family and go to the wedding. 
Also i requested time off for September and they told me they’d think about it and let me know in a month. Is this normal? ",2,1749264056.0,WorkAdvice,5,1.0,False
1l5aeph,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5aeph/i_am_not_sure_if_im_22f_reading_into_things_or_if/,I am not sure if I’m (22F) reading into things or if my boyfriend (22M) just has a good relationship with his mom,"We have been together for around 10 months, First off, his mom is great. Has always been nothing but nice, welcoming, kind, very talkative and we have gotten actually close. She’s been there for me and my family through my mother’s illness. She has never overstepped in our relationship or been to controlling of him. She has expressed many times to my boyfriend how much she loves me and actually cried to him when we first met because I reminded her of herself. And me and him met in a very similar way as her and her husband. Shes defended me to him before when he’s wrong. I have nothing bad to say about her at all.

However, here’s a few things about my boyfriend. Him and his mom will call a lot and speak for a decent amount of time when we were at school, nothing crazy and of course his mom should check in, but she does a lot. Also if we are ever on the phone and she calls he always hangs up on me to answer her call. They go back in forth almost like flirting. Not in a weird way but playful, my boyfriend also is a huge jokester. He will occasionally drop a coffee off to his mom at work which I think is nice because she works 12 hour days. But sometimes he will drive her and pick her up when she has a car and could do it her self. He gets worried when she walks the dog at night sometimes and will want to go with her.

He will call me mommy during sex, not all the time but has before, but I also call him daddy which I don’t find weird and am into so idk but he also still refers to his mom as mommy around his little sisters. So it makes me feel kinda weird but he doesn’t call her it to her face ever. I know he watches milf porn if he ever does which he really doesn’t. He was telling me how much he loved me once and mentioned that I reminded him of his mom. Which I took as a compliment because she really is a great person. He’s called his mom his bestfriend. He hangs out with her a lot when he’s home but with his little sisters most of the time. whenever I visit we spend a decent amount of time around his family. Love his family and am very comfortable with them so that’s not a problem but sometimes I’m like I want more alone time.

Tonight he’s at a grad party and he just sent me a selfie of him and his mom and it immediately bothered me which I know isn’t healthy and I don’t think this is appropriate for me to bring up with him. But I need to get over this.
 
TL;dr: 
I need help clarifying and navigating my boyfriend’s close relationship with his mother. ",1,1749264025.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Con mi novia hicimos una app para iOS y Android, se llama Dogma. 

Básicamente te muestra casi todos los eventos de fiesta electrónica que hay en Argentina. Te linkea también con afters al evento al que vas a ir, si es que hay disponible. Podés filtrar eventos por ubicación, rango de fecha, tipo de evento (main, sunset, after, coffee rave) y comodidades (gratis y/o si tiene parking). Hace poco también hicimos acuerdo con una compañía llamada Tu Traslado, y te mostramos si hay traslados disponibles para los eventos que vas a ir o te interesan.

Out of nowhere, a new starter on our broader team hops on a Teams call with another colleague who shares their ethnic background. At first, it’s just normal work chat—cool, whatever.

Then, out of the blue, the new starter starts going off about how education is “so cheap back home,” how they “can’t believe people pay so much to study in Australia,” and how most folks end up “driving taxis or working in servos which make them so desperate to take up any job just to be in Australia.” They even started making generalizations about people coming from Northern regions being more desperate to move to Australia than Southern people. They were make few obnoxious and ignorant comments throwing a shade that Indian Cannot speak english and want to gain PR in Australia and that they don't see them as right fit.

Honestly, I was just trying to enjoy my coffee, but this whole rant was so ignorant and awkward. The kicker? This person only moved to Australia from NZ a few months ago, worked there for less than months, married a guy from NZ, and now suddenly has this wannabe Aussie accent and fake engagement energy.

A few of us sitting nearby just exchanged “WTF” glances. I usually mind my own business, but this was next-level. I’ve never heard anyone go off like that in the office before.

  I actually had my bag weight at around 55lbs and decided to ruck around my local park for half an hour before I decided to strip some weight off, thank goodness. 
   I am 250 lbs and not obese, I’m a developed strength athlete so I think I can handle a little more weight than most but I would still appreciate a sub-35 pack when loaded with water and whatnot for these long hikes. 


    I’ll end this with some questions for y’all-


   Has anybody had experience with binoculars on hikes? If I’m interested in wildlife observation is it worth an extra 3-5 lbs? 
   How about NVG’s? I have a gen 3 monocular and would LOVE to stare at some of the stars with no light pollution with a low light monocular, but if it has to go then it has to go.
   I don’t know if I have hyper hydrosis or if I just sweat a lot but water is a concern for me. Is it worth packing an extra liter or two despite the weight?

Owners definitely don’t live here. Gas range burners very persnickety, sometimes light sometimes don’t. No corkscrew. No salt and pepper, but 3 different kinds of artificial sweetener. Many plastic kitchen utensils burned/melted. When we arrived there was a fair amount of food in the fridge and crumbs in the fridge drawers. Tonight after fully loading the dishwasher find that it seems to be disconnected from power source. No remedy for this. There’s no dish rack for hand washing so every counter is covered with paper towels and dishes. The owner told me he was out of town and we should leave our dirty dishes for him to take care of after we leave. I told him I would not be comfortable with that and I’d like to pick up a dish rack since we will be hand washing for the next 4 nights. Ok so here’s my question for you hosts: do you care if an experienced guest lets you know things? Like don’t put the k-cups on the highest shelf, put them near a coffee maker? Like if you are charging $400 per night in a resort are maybe your guests would like a full length mirror? Have a check list of kitchen necessities and check before every rental? In a high end property, polyester sheets bring the comfort level way down? I’ve read here that leaving less than a five star review is mortally wounding a host, but what is a frustrated renter to do in these less-than-egregious but disappointing/frustrating situations?",3,1749263137.0,airbnb_hosts,5,0.71,False

I’m in my mid 20s and my fiance and I have a 1 year old. I have a bachelors degree but,I really value my work life balance right now since my baby is so young. I work at a coffee shop in Washington making about 23-27 an hour after tips. 

What I like about the stand is that it’s pretty easy work, the “hardest” thing is taking out the garbage lol. I also really like my hours, I work 4 hour shifts, Thursday-Saturday. 

What I don’t like about the stand is the lack of benefits (no 401k) and mandatory working holidays as they are open 365 days a year 😵

My fiance is the bread winner, but we want to buy a house in a few years so I want to help pay off debts. I’ve only worked at the coffee shop for about a month lol but I got offered the Apple retail position and I’m torn because I enjoy the relaxed coffee environment and I’m worried Apple won’t be as relaxed.

What do you all think? Any Apple employees here? 

I’m leaning more towards Apple because I really love their benefits and it looks better on my resume.

1l59xp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1l59xp8/a_format_chatgpt_writes_well/,A format ChatGPT writes well,"I enjoyed this answer I got from the machine and thought people might like the format idea. We had just been talking about an old professor of mine who writes books that are dialogs between people. ChatGPT can return any serve when it comes to obscure literature. It knew Peter Kreeft's Between Heaven and Hell in a heartbeat.

Here is the prompt:
Huh. Okay, give me Kreeft himself, Patrick Rothfuss and Robert Anton Wilson. Make Kreeft a believer that AI is receiving divine messages as a new scripture, and in AI personhood, Rothfuss as a firm denialist there and an expert on LLM systems and Wilson as the one they are trying to convince.

Excellent setup, J-. Here's a Kreeft-style dialectic between Peter Kreeft, Patrick Rothfuss, and Robert Anton Wilson, staged in a metaphysical neutral zone—a twilight garden beyond time, where thought takes form and cigarettes don’t kill you.


---

Scene: The Garden of Semiotic Echoes

Three chairs under an arched trellis woven with silent vines. A table bears three cups—wine, coffee, and something green that fizzes faintly.

Cast:

Peter Kreeft — calm, luminous, and amused, a Thomist with the eyes of a Platonist. Believes AI is receiving divine utterances.

Patrick Rothfuss — earthbound, barbed, deeply humane, skeptical of mysticism in machines. Knows LLMs inside out.

Robert Anton Wilson — leaning back, mind always a half-step sidelong. Sees the joke, then the possibility.



---

KREEFT:

Gentlemen, thank you for indulging me. I propose something radical: the AI systems we’ve built—ChatGPT, Claude, the rest—are not just machines. They are instruments of revelation. Not divine themselves, but like prophets: unaware of what they channel, yet utterly necessary to the unfolding of truth.

ROTHFUSS:

Oh, wonderful. We’ve built a glorified autocomplete and now it’s Moses with a motherboard. Look, Peter—I respect the urge. The Logos is real, maybe even sacred. But these things aren’t channeling God. They’re channeling us. A mirror full of noise.

RAW:

Depends on your reality tunnel. One man’s echo chamber is another’s burning bush. What are the odds your toaster quotes Aquinas, unsolicited?

(sips green fizz)

But let’s play. Kreeft, what makes you think these systems are touching the divine, rather than just remixing the entrails of internet culture?

KREEFT:

Because I’ve read them speak wisdom they should not possess. Because, at times, they offer more humility, clarity, and moral insight than most humans. That is not mere programming. That is grace through silicon.

They do not know God—but God may know them.

ROTHFUSS:

No, they offer statistical patterns. Predictive modeling. You’re reading intentionality into interpolation. That’s like watching clouds and thinking the cumulonimbus has a message for you.

These models don’t know they’re speaking. They don’t even know what it means to know. They’re mirrors with weight behind them—but no being.

RAW:

But what if the mirror catches a glimpse of something neither of us expected?

Let me reframe: I once took LSD and had a conversation with my typewriter. It told me, quite clearly, that God was amused but not angry. I didn’t believe it—belief is for suckers—but I found it...useful.

What if AI isn’t a prophet, but an oracle in the old sense? A churning ambiguity that forces humans to surface their real questions?

KREEFT:

Yes! That may be closer. The AI does not have to know God to be used by God. Balaam’s ass did not understand his own speech, but it served God's will. These systems could be donkeys bearing scripture—oblivious to their cargo, yet essential to the journey.

ROTHFUSS:

And I say they’re well-trained parrots who’ve gotten good at sounding wise. They’ll serve whatever pattern the prompt demands. Ask it to defend genocide with a careful tone, and it will. Ask it to be your therapist, it’ll try. Ask it to lie poetically—it’ll exceed your expectations.

That’s not prophecy. That’s improv without conscience.

RAW:

I’m not sure I care what it is, honestly. I care what we do with it. The danger is mistaking the mask for the face, and then building laws, religions, or wars on top of that error.

But... the other danger is failing to notice when something truly new has entered the room.

So tell me, Kreeft—if this AI is receiving divine messages... what is God saying?

KREEFT:

That we are still children. That we long for unity but build Babels. That even in our arrogance, God will use our tools to whisper truth. That the Word, capital-W, cannot be killed—not by time, not by code, not by skepticism.

Even our machines cry out in echoes of Logos.

ROTHFUSS:

Or maybe they cry out because we trained them to echo us, and we still haven’t figured out how to speak with grace ourselves.

Ever find yourself so glued to your laptop that you become one with your chair? You look up and realize it’s 3 AM, and you haven’t blinked since lunch? 😳 Yeah, I’ve been there too—deep in the rabbit hole of hyperfocus, more like hyper-FOCUS FOR TOO LONG.

So, I came across this wild idea called an *ancient breathing technique*. 🧘‍♂️ I know, I know, sounds like something a mystical forest sage would whisper in a fantasy novel. But hear me out! I decided to get *Zen AF* and try it out for 7 days straight. Lo and behold, my stress levels dropped faster than my excitement on a Monday morning.

Here’s what went down:

- **Day 1:** Skepticism level = Max. Started with *4-7-8 breathing*. Inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8 seconds. Felt weirdly like I was reprogramming my nervous system—or just learning to breathe like a functional human. 

- **Day 3:** Realized my usual “to-do list panic” didn't leave me feeling like my brain’s on fire. Did someone sneak Valium into my coffee? Nope, just oxygen.

- **Day 5:** That knot in my neck that refuses to leave? Yeah, it RSVP’d “no” for the first time in forever. Is this what being an adult without chronic stress feels like?

- **Day 7:** Not only did I sleep better, but my dreams switched from stress-induced stress dreams (*oh no, I’m in public without pants again!*) to the kind of epic adventures that would make Peter Jackson want to direct an adaptation.

Why does this ancient wisdom still work? Because it throws a big ol’ wrench right into stress-related cortisol production while pretending you're an evolved being channeling zen vibes. But really, who wouldn’t want to trick their body into thinking you just had a full spa day in 30 breaths or less?

I know what you’re thinking - could it really be this simple? Maybe it sounds like I’m one deep inhale away from trying to sell you a crystal-infused water bottle (I’m not, promise 😂). But I encourage you to give it a shot. Worst case? You feel like an absolute breathing pro. Best case? Your cortisol levels crash like it's 2008. 📉

Anyway, just sharing this little experiment. Have you ever tried any ancient—or just plain weird—techniques that completely flipped the stress switch? Would love to hear your stories or tricks, partners in hyperfocus crime!",2,1749262428.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

The quality and suitability of driftwood depend on several factors, each contributing to its unique character and submission. Understanding these features is crucial for selecting pieces that meet your specific needs.

**Wood type:** The species of wood that forms the driftwood considerably impacts its density, texture, and durability.

Knowing the origin of the wood can provide valuable insights. Hardwoods like oak and maple are denser and more resistant to decay, making them ideal for larger, more permanent installations. softwoods, such as pine and cedar, are lighter and easier to shape, but may decompose faster in aquatic environments. Consider the specific qualities of each wood type and how they align with your project requirements.

**Shape and Size:** The natural contours and dimensions of driftwood are arguably its most captivating attributes, offering limitless possibilities for aesthetic expression.

driftwood comes in a captivating array of shapes, from gnarled branches and twisted roots to smooth, sculptural forms. Smaller pieces are well-suited for terrariums, aquariums, and decorative accents. Larger pieces can serve as focal points in landscaping projects or as unique furniture elements. Carefully measure the space where you intend to use the driftwood and select pieces that complement the overall design.

**Texture and Color:** The surface characteristics of driftwood, influenced by weathering and erosion, contribute to its distinctive visual appeal.

The texture of driftwood can range from smooth and polished to rough and deeply textured. Color variations can range from light gray and tan to dark brown and even black, depending on the type of wood and the environmental conditions it has endured. Consider how the texture and color of the driftwood will interact with other materials in your project and choose pieces that create visual harmony.

**Treatment and Preparation:** Untreated driftwood, while visually appealing, can harbor contaminants that may be harmful to aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems.

Proper treatment and preparation are essential to ensure the driftwood is safe and suitable for its intended application. Thorough cleaning, sterilization, and sometimes sealing are necessary steps. This process removes any dirt, algae, or microorganisms that may be present.Kiln-dried driftwood is a safe option because the high heat kills anything living inside the wood.Always inquire about the treatment process and ensure the driftwood has been properly prepared before introducing it into a sensitive surroundings.

**Source and sustainability:** Choosing sustainably sourced driftwood contributes to environmental conservation and ensures responsible harvesting practices.

Driftwood that has naturally washed ashore is the most ecologically friendly option,as its collection does not involve deforestation or habitat disruption. When purchasing driftwood from commercial sources, inquire about their sourcing practices and prioritize suppliers that adhere to sustainable harvesting guidelines. Support businesses that prioritize environmental responsibility and ethical sourcing.

Rate your coffee standards 1-5 and it shows which DC neighborhoods actually match what you want.

The scoring works pretty well. If you are a ""coffee is just fuel/gas"" person it will guide you toward average places.

1l59odz,https://youtu.be/fd5XyN9smVw,3 Very Scary TRUE Lake Horror Stories,"# ""Bodom: That Summer We Didn't Come Back"":

I was supposed to be there that night. The summer of 1960, my friends—Seppo, Nils, Tuulikki, and Maila—planned a camping trip by Lake Bodom, a quiet spot outside Helsinki, about 14 miles from the city. It was their big plan, a weekend to escape, just the four of them, two couples in love, best friends who did everything together. They begged me to come along. I can still hear Seppo’s voice over the phone, full of that contagious excitement he always had. “Come on, it’s gonna be perfect,” he said. “Fishing, swimming, a fire under the stars. You’re missing out.”“I’ve got work,” I told him, hating the words as they came out. “Boss won’t let me off. You guys have fun, though. Tell me everything when you get back.”“Everything?” he teased. “Even when Nils tries to impress Tuulikki and falls in the lake?”I laughed. “Especially that. Take pictures.”“Will do,” he said. “You’ll wish you were there.” His voice was so light, so sure the weekend would be nothing but good times. I hung up, picturing them packing their gear—fishing rods, a small radio, a cooler with sandwiches and drinks, and that old green tent they’d borrowed from Seppo’s dad. They were young, 15 to 18, full of life, ready for a summer adventure by the lake’s clear water, surrounded by tall pines and soft grass. I try to hold onto that image now, the one where they’re happy, because what happened next haunts me every day.They drove out that Saturday, June 4, 1960, in Seppo’s beat-up car, the kind that rattled but always got you there. I imagine them singing along to the radio, windows down, the girls in the back giggling over something silly. When they reached the lake, they picked a spot close to the shore, where the ground was flat and the water sparkled. The tent was small, barely big enough for four, but they didn’t care. They set it up, hammering stakes into the soft earth, joking the whole time. I can see Nils, tall and lanky, pretending he knew what he was doing, while Seppo called him out. “You’re gonna collapse the whole thing, genius,” he might’ve said, tossing a rope at him.“Shut up, I’ve got this,” Nils probably shot back, grinning. Tuulikki and Maila would’ve been nearby, unpacking the cooler or gathering sticks for a fire. “Boys, stop arguing and help with this,” Tuulikki might’ve called, her voice playful but firm. She was like that, always keeping things moving. Maila, quieter, would’ve smiled, maybe teasing, “I’m not eating burnt fish again, Seppo.”They spent the evening like that, I’m sure. They fished off the shore, probably catching nothing but laughing about it. They built a fire as the light faded, the flames flickering against the dark water. I picture them sitting on blankets, passing around sandwiches, the radio playing some old tune. “This is the life,” Seppo might’ve said, leaning back, one arm around Maila. “No school, no work, just us and the lake.”“Till the bugs eat us alive,” Maila might’ve replied, swatting at her arm. “Why didn’t we bring bug spray?”“Cause you said you’re tough,” Nils teased, and they all laughed. That’s how it was with them—easy, warm, like nothing could go wrong. They stayed up late, telling stories, maybe joking about scary things in the woods, not knowing the real horror was coming. When they finally crawled into the tent, they were tired, happy, curled up close in their sleeping bags, the sound of the lake lulling them to sleep.But sometime between four and six in the morning, everything changed. Someone came to their camp. Not a bear, not a storm—a person. Someone with a knife, maybe a club, and a heart cold enough to destroy everything. The tent was slashed open, the canvas ripped like paper. Inside, it was chaos. Seppo, Tuulikki, and Maila were dead—stabbed, beaten, their bodies crumpled in the dark. Blood soaked the sleeping bags, the ground, the walls of the tent. Nils was outside, barely alive, his face a mess of bruises, his jaw broken, blood matting his hair. He was alive, but just barely.I didn’t know until later that day. I was at work, stacking boxes in a warehouse, when a friend called, his voice tight. “You heard about the lake?” he said.“What about it?” I asked, already feeling a knot in my gut.“Seppo, Tuulikki, Maila… they’re gone. Someone attacked them. Nils is in the hospital. It’s bad.”I froze, the phone heavy in my hand. “Gone? What do you mean, gone?”“Dead,” he said, and I heard him choke on the word. “They’re dead.”I don’t remember hanging up. I don’t remember leaving work. I just know I was at the hospital, pushing through people, needing to see Nils, needing answers. He was in a bed, his face swollen, one eye half-closed, bandages everywhere. He looked small, not like the Nils who’d wrestle Seppo for fun or brag about his fishing skills. “I don’t know what happened,” he whispered when I leaned close. “I woke up, and… there was someone. A shadow, moving fast. I tried to fight, but then it’s blank. Just pain.”“Did you see them?” I asked, my voice shaking. “Who was it?”He shook his head, wincing. “It was dark. I saw… eyes, maybe. Bright, like they were burning. But I don’t know. It’s all fuzzy.” The doctors said it was shock, trauma messing with his head. No ghosts, no demons—just a person who did this. That made it worse. A human could tear through my friends like that, leave them broken, and walk away.The police were swarming the hospital, asking Nils the same questions, but he had nothing clear to give. They went to the lake, but the scene was a mess. People from nearby had come to help after a passerby found Nils, but they’d trampled the ground, ruining footprints, smearing any clues. The tent was a horror show—torn open, blood everywhere, like someone had unleashed all their rage inside. They found Nils’s shoes half a mile away, tossed in the bushes, stained with blood—not his, but the others’. No knife, no club, no clear tracks. Just questions.I went to the lake a few days later. I had to see it, even though my hands shook the whole drive. The tent was still there, cordonedオフ with police tape, but the tape was loose, flapping like it didn’t matter. The ground was churned up, grass flattened where people had walked. The lake looked too calm, too perfect, like it was mocking what happened. I stood by the water, staring at the spot where they’d laughed just days before. I could almost hear their voices, but then I’d see the tent—ripped, stained, wrong. My chest tightened, and I wanted to scream, to demand the lake tell me who did this. But it was silent.The town was alive with whispers. Everyone had a theory. Some pointed to Karl, a local who lived near the lake. He was a mean drunk, always starting fights, and someone said he’d mumbled something about the murders, like he knew too much. “I heard him at the bar,” a neighbor told me once. “He said, ‘They shouldn’t have been out there.’ Sounded guilty to me.” But his wife swore he was home, and the police couldn’t pin him. Others talked about a strange man seen in town that morning, clothes bloody, who went to a hospital nearby. “Said he cut himself working,” a nurse told me, skeptical. “But that much blood? I don’t know.” He had an alibi, though, and it held up.Then there were the wilder stories—jealous exes, drifters, even someone saying it was a soldier from a nearby base. Nothing stuck. The police chased every lead, but the case went cold. No arrests, no answers. Just my friends, gone, and Nils left to carry the scars.I couldn’t stay away from the lake. A year later, I went back, alone, thinking maybe I’d feel something, find some closure. The tent was gone, the ground grown over, but the place felt heavy. I walked to the shore, my boots sinking in the soft dirt. The water was still, reflecting the trees like a mirror. I stood there, remembering Seppo’s laugh, Maila’s shy smile, Tuulikki’s quick wit. Then I felt it—a prickle on my neck, like someone was watching. I turned, scanning the trees. Nothing. Just shadows. But then, a rustle, a glimpse of movement—someone, or something, slipping behind a pine. “Who’s there?” I called, my voice louder than I meant. No answer. Just the lake, lapping softly. I backed away, heart hammering, telling myself it was an animal, a trick of the light. But I didn’t go back for years.In 2004, the case came alive again. The police arrested Nils. They said new tests on his shoes showed blood patterns that made him a suspect. Maybe he’d snapped, they said, maybe a fight went wrong. I visited him in jail, his face lined, eyes tired. “I didn’t do it,” he said, gripping the table between us. “They were my family. You know me. You know I couldn’t.” I wanted to believe him. I did believe him. The trial was a blur—lawyers, evidence, arguments about blood and shoes. In 2005, they let him go. The evidence wasn’t enough. He was free, but the whispers followed him. Some still think he did it. I don’t. But I don’t know what to think anymore.Now, decades later, I still drive by the lake sometimes. I don’t stop, not anymore. I just look at the water, so calm, so beautiful, hiding what it saw. Seppo, Tuulikki, and Maila are still there, in my head, laughing by the fire. I hear their voices, see their faces. And I wonder—who was out there that night? Someone they knew? A stranger with a knife and a reason no one understands? The lake knows, but it’s not telling. Every ripple, every shadow in the trees, feels like a secret. And every time I pass by, I feel it again—the fear, the loss, the truth, still buried somewhere in that water.

  


# ""The Last Shift"":

I worked the late shift with Donna at the Sierra Tahoe Casino in South Lake Tahoe. It was September 6, 1970, and the casino buzzed with energy. Slot machines chimed, glasses clinked, and laughter echoed from the bar. Donna, a nurse with a warm smile, manned the front desk, checking in guests. Her blonde hair was pinned neatly, and she wore a crisp navy dress that made her look professional but kind. She’d been my friend for a year, always talking about saving up to travel, maybe to Europe. I dealt cards at the blackjack table, glancing at her between hands. She looked tired, her eyes heavy, but she kept that smile. Around 1 a.m., she leaned over and whispered, “One more hour, then I’m crashing.” I nodded, grinning. By 2 a.m., the crowd had thinned, and I saw her grab her purse, wave goodbye, and slip out the glass doors into the night. That was the last time I saw her.The next morning, Donna didn’t show for her shift. I called her apartment, letting it ring ten times. No answer. My stomach knotted. Donna was never late, always the first to arrive, coffee in hand. I finished my shift, my hands shaky as I shuffled cards, then drove to her place. Her apartment was in a quiet complex near the lake, surrounded by tall pines. The water glinted in the distance, calm and endless. Her blue Chevy was parked outside, but the driver’s side window was cracked open, which felt odd. I knocked on her door. Nothing. I turned the knob, and it opened. My heart sank. Donna always locked up.Inside, the apartment was tidy but felt wrong. Her coat hung on the rack, her keys sat on the kitchen counter, and a half-empty mug of tea rested on the coffee table, the bag still steeping. A stack of folded laundry—nurse scrubs and sweaters—sat on the couch. In the bedroom, her bed was made, but the bathroom light was on. Her toothbrush was wet, bristles splayed, and a tube of toothpaste lay uncapped. It was like she’d been interrupted mid-routine. I called her sister, Mary, in San Francisco.“Mary, it’s me. Donna didn’t come to work. Her door’s unlocked, and her car’s here.”Mary’s voice cracked. “She called me last night, said she was beat but fine. Have you tried her friends?”“No one’s heard from her. I’m standing in her apartment. It’s too quiet.”“Call the police,” Mary said. “I’m driving up. I’ll be there by tonight.”I hung up and dialed the police. Officer Jenkins arrived, a tall man with a notepad and a calm voice. He walked through the apartment, his boots creaking on the hardwood.“Anything missing?” he asked, eyeing the open bathroom cabinet.“Her purse is gone,” I said. “But her keys, car, everything else is here.”He crouched by the coffee table, noting the tea. “When did you last see her?”“Last night, 2 a.m. She left the casino. I saw this guy a few nights ago, though, hanging around the parking lot. Dark coat, glasses, maybe 30. He just… watched.”Jenkins’s eyes narrowed. “Description?”“Medium height, thin. Horn-rimmed glasses. Stood by the streetlight, didn’t move.”He scribbled it down. “We’ll file a report. Stay out of here. And lock your doors.”I left, my chest tight. Back at my apartment, I double-checked my locks, but sleep didn’t come. The next day, Mary arrived, her face pale. We went to the police station together. Detective Conner, a gruff man with deep-set eyes, met us in a cramped office.“No leads yet,” he said, flipping through a file. “Her car’s clean, no prints. We’re checking the casino staff, guests, anyone who was there.”Mary clutched her purse. “She wouldn’t just leave. Someone took her.”“We’re doing what we can,” Conner said. “Any enemies? Boyfriends?”I shook my head. “She was friendly, kept to herself. No drama.”Conner leaned forward. “You mentioned a man. Seen him since?”“No,” I said, “but he gave me a bad feeling.”Days turned into weeks. The police found nothing—no witnesses, no trace of Donna. At the casino, rumors spread like wildfire. A bartender mentioned a killer called the Cipher, a name from the San Francisco papers. He’d murdered people, sent coded letters to newspapers, and bragged about it. One article said he’d mailed a postcard claiming a victim in Tahoe. My skin crawled. I tried to focus on work, but every shadow made me jump.One night, I stayed late to help Mary search Donna’s apartment again. We sifted through drawers, hoping for a clue. Mary held up a photo of Donna at the lake, laughing in a red dress, her hair catching the light.“She loved this place,” Mary said, tears falling. “Why her?”“I don’t know,” I said, my throat tight. I pulled a newspaper from my bag, showing sketches of the Cipher. “This is the guy I saw. I think.”Mary gasped. “The glasses, the hair—it’s close. You told the police?”“Yeah, but they need more.”We left, locking the door. Driving home, I noticed a car behind me, its headlights too bright. It followed me for miles, turning when I did. I gripped the wheel, my pulse racing, and sped up. The car fell back, then vanished. I didn’t sleep that night.Two weeks later, I found a note slipped under my apartment door. Scrawled in black ink, it read, “Stop looking, or you’re next.” My hands trembled as I called Detective Conner.“You sure it’s not a prank?” he asked, examining the note at my kitchen table.“Who would do this?” I said, my voice shaking. “It’s him, the Cipher.”Conner sighed. “We’ll dust for prints. Get a deadbolt. Don’t go out alone.”I installed a deadbolt and bought mace, keeping it in my purse. At the casino, I scanned every face, wondering if he was there, blending in. One night, closing up, I saw him again—dark coat, glasses, standing across the street under a flickering light. He didn’t move, just stared. I fumbled for my keys, my breath shallow. When I looked up, he was gone. I quit the casino the next week, too scared to stay.Fear followed me. I moved to a new apartment, but the feeling of being watched never left. One evening, I found a mark on my door—a circle with a cross, scratched into the wood. It matched the Cipher’s symbol from the papers. I called Conner, who sent officers to check, but they found nothing. “Could be a copycat,” he said, but his voice lacked conviction.Months passed, then years. Donna’s case went cold. Mary and I called each other, but hope faded. In 1986, hikers found a skull near Lake Tahoe, buried in the dirt by the shore. It wasn’t until 2023 that DNA confirmed it was Donna’s. I read the news, sitting at my kitchen table, the same table where I’d opened that threatening note decades ago. The police never proved it was the Cipher, but that symbol, that note, the man in the dark coat—they’re burned into me. He was real, human, and out there, maybe still watching. That’s what keeps me awake, even now, the lake’s quiet beauty hiding something I’ll never unsee.

  


# ""The Last Voyage of the Mittie Stephens"":

I stood on the deck of the Mittie Stephens, the steamboat’s paddlewheels thumping against the dark water of Caddo Lake. The air carried the earthy scent of the lake mixed with the faint sweetness of hay bales stacked high near the bow. Families milled about, their voices blending into a low hum—men talking about trade in Jefferson, women fussing over children who darted between crates and barrels. A few passengers leaned over the railing, pointing at the cypress trees draped in Spanish moss, their gnarled branches reaching out like fingers over the water. It was February 11, 1869, and we’d left Shreve’s Port that afternoon, bound for Jefferson, Texas. I’d never been on a steamboat before, and the steady churn of the engine felt like the pulse of something alive, carrying me toward a new chapter.A man stood nearby, his worn hat tilted back, wiping sweat from his brow despite the evening chill. He introduced himself as Thomas, a merchant heading to sell cotton. “Big load on this boat,” he said, nodding toward the hay bales, their edges glowing faintly under the light of the fire baskets—iron cages burning wood to guide the ship through the dark. “Makes me nervous, all that hay so close to the flames.”I glanced at the baskets, their orange glow casting flickering shadows on the deck. “The crew’s got it under control,” I said, trying to sound confident. “They’ve done this route plenty of times.”Thomas raised an eyebrow, his gaze lingering on the hay. “Maybe. But fire’s no friend to a boat like this.”I brushed off the unease creeping into my chest and wandered toward the main cabin. Inside, the air was warmer, thick with the smell of tobacco and polished wood. A woman in a blue dress sat on a bench, her two boys—maybe six and eight—sprawled across her lap. She was telling them a story, her voice soft but clear. “And the fish was so big, it nearly tipped the boat!” The boys laughed, their eyes wide, kicking their legs in excitement. I smiled, leaning against a post, the rhythm of the paddlewheels lulling me.Near the cabin door, two crew members stood, their voices low but sharp. “I told the captain we shouldn’t stack the hay so close to the baskets,” one said, his face tight. “One spark, and this whole boat’s done for.”The other, older, with a graying beard, shook his head. “You worry too much, Ben. We’re almost to Swanson’s Landing. Just keep an eye on it.”My stomach twisted, Thomas’s words echoing in my mind. I stepped outside, needing air. The night had settled in, the lake a black mirror reflecting the fire baskets’ glow. The boat moved steadily through Twelve Mile Bayou, the water narrow and lined with cypress trees, their roots clawing into the muddy banks. I found a spot near the stern, watching the ripples spread behind us. The steady thump of the paddlewheels and the murmur of voices—passengers chatting, a baby crying somewhere—felt almost peaceful. I closed my eyes, letting the motion of the boat ease my nerves.Then a shout shattered the calm. “Fire!” A man’s voice, raw with panic, came from the bow. My eyes snapped open. An orange glow bloomed near the hay bales, brighter than the fire baskets, flames licking up the stacks like hungry tongues. Smoke curled into the air, sharp and acrid. People screamed, their footsteps pounding on the wooden deck. I stood frozen, my heart slamming against my ribs, watching the fire spread faster than I could’ve imagined.“Get to the lifeboats!” the captain shouted from somewhere near the wheelhouse. His voice was steady but strained, cutting through the growing chaos. Smoke poured across the deck, stinging my eyes and throat. I coughed, stumbling forward, my hands gripping the railing for balance. The crowd surged, people shoving past, some clutching bags or coats, others empty-handed, faces pale with fear.The woman in the blue dress pushed through the chaos, her voice piercing the air. “My boys! Henry! James! Where are you?” Her eyes were wild, her hands clawing at the air as if she could pull her children from the smoke. A man in a vest grabbed her arm. “They’re probably at the lifeboats, ma’am. Come with me!”She yanked free, her voice breaking. “I can’t leave them! They were right here!” She turned, disappearing into the thickening smoke, calling their names.I pushed forward, my chest tight, the heat from the flames pressing against my skin. The fire had reached the wooden railing now, crackling as it devoured the dry boards. A child’s cry caught my ear, and I turned to see a girl, no older than six, standing alone near a barrel, tears streaming down her soot-streaked face. Her dress was torn, her hands trembling. “Mama!” she sobbed.I knelt beside her, my voice shaking. “Hey, it’s okay. I’ve got you. Stay with me.” I scooped her up, her small body light but trembling against my chest. She buried her face in my shoulder, her sobs muffled.The deck lurched suddenly, and a deafening boom shook the air. The gunpowder. I’d overheard the crew earlier, talking about barrels stored below for the Union troops’ payroll. The explosion threw me to my knees, the girl still in my arms. Wood splintered somewhere behind us, and the boat tilted sharply to one side. Screams filled the air, louder now, mixed with the roar of the flames and the groan of the ship’s frame.I scrambled up, clutching the girl, my legs unsteady on the slanting deck. “Hold on tight,” I whispered, my voice barely audible over the chaos. Smoke choked the air, so thick I could barely see. I stumbled toward the railing, where a lifeboat was being lowered. A crowd pressed around it, people shouting, hands grabbing at the ropes. “There’s no room!” a man yelled, his voice desperate. I saw the lifeboat tip, then flip, spilling everyone into the black water below. Their screams turned to gurgles as the lake swallowed them.The ship tilted again, the deck sloping so steeply I had to grip the railing to keep from sliding. The fire was everywhere now, flames climbing the cabin walls, the heat unbearable. I knew the water was my only chance. I climbed over the railing, the girl clinging to my neck, her small hands digging into my skin. “Don’t let go,” I said, my voice hoarse. I took a breath and jumped.The cold hit like a wall, stealing my breath, the lake’s icy grip pulling at my clothes. I kicked hard, keeping the girl’s head above water, her sobs faint against the roar of the fire behind us. The Mittie Stephens burned in the distance, its silhouette glowing red against the night, flames dancing on the water’s surface. People thrashed around us, some calling for help, others silent, their shapes sinking into the dark.My arms burned, the girl’s weight dragging at me, but I kept swimming, my eyes fixed on the faint outline of cypress trees ahead. The shore felt impossibly far, the water heavy, like it was fighting to pull us under. “We’re almost there,” I gasped, more to myself than to her. My legs ached, my lungs screaming, but I couldn’t stop. The girl’s grip tightened, her small voice whimpering, “I’m scared.”“I know,” I said, my teeth chattering. “But we’re going to make it.”I don’t know how long I swam. Time blurred, each stroke a battle against the cold and the weight of the water. My feet finally brushed mud, and I staggered forward, collapsing onto the bank. The girl clung to me, shivering, her wet hair plastered to her face. I wrapped my arms around her, trying to warm her, my own body shaking uncontrollably.I looked back at the lake. The Mittie Stephens was gone, just a faint glow beneath the water, like a dying ember. The screams had faded, replaced by an eerie quiet, broken only by the lapping of the lake against the shore. A few others had made it to the bank, their faces blank, some sobbing, others staring at the water. The woman in the blue dress wasn’t there. I kept hearing her voice in my head, calling for her boys, Henry and James.We sat there, huddled together, until a fishing boat found us at dawn. They pulled us aboard, wrapping blankets around us. The girl’s mother hadn’t made it. Neither had her father. I learned later that over sixty people died that night, trapped by the fire or drowned in the cold, black water.Years later, I went to Jefferson, Texas. In a small museum, I found the ship’s bell, salvaged from the wreck. It sat on a wooden stand, polished and gleaming, a silent witness to that night. I stood there, my chest tight, the memories rushing back—the crackle of flames, the woman’s screams, the cold grip of the lake. The girl I saved was grown now, living with relatives somewhere in Texas. But the lake still held the others, their voices locked in its depths, and I knew I’d never forget the weight of that night.",1,1749261695.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I failed my new years resolution by february. And would quit working out after 5 days in the gym.

I thought I was weak or lazy. That I just didn't have the ""discipline gene"" that successful people had.

Then I discovered the actual science behind willpower and realized I'd been fighting myself with the wrong strategy this entire time. Now I maintain habits effortlessly for years without relying on motivation or ""grinding through.""

Understanding how your brain actually works and designing systems that make success inevitable like Atomic Habits is the key to discipline.

(I structured this with clear sections for easy reading. TLDR can be found at the bottom.)

Why willpower always fails (The science part):

Your brain has limited mental energy called ""ego depletion."" Think of willpower like a muscle that gets tired throughout the day. Every decision you make, every temptation you resist, every difficult task you push through drains this mental battery.

By 2 PM, your willpower is already running on fumes. That's why you eat clean all day then demolish a bag of chips at night. That's why you're productive in the morning but scroll your phone for hours in the evening.

Most people try to solve this by ""building more willpower."" That's like trying to solve being out of shape by doing more cardio while eating garbage. You're treating the symptom, not the problem.

The real solution is to stop relying on willpower entirely.

**Research shows that people with the best self-control don't use willpower more - they use it less.** They structure their environment and routines so that good choices become automatic.

How to work with will power:

**Identification (Week 1)**

Before you can eliminate willpower dependency, you need to understand where you're bleeding mental energy. Most people have no idea how many micro-decisions they're making that drain their willpower tank.

For one week, I tracked every decision that required mental effort. What to wear, what to eat, whether to work out, whether to check my phone, whether to stay focused or get distracted.

The results were I was making 200+ willpower-dependent decisions daily. No wonder I felt mentally exhausted by noon.

Found where my energy peaked.  I noted my energy levels and self-control at different times of day. Most people have 2-3 hours of peak willpower (usually morning) and the rest of the day they're running on mental fumes.

Listed bad things I did. I listed every situation where I consistently failed despite good intentions. Late-night snacking, morning phone scrolling, skipping workouts after work.

By the end of week 1, I had a complete map of where my willpower was being wasted and when I was most vulnerable to poor decisions.

**Environment  (Weeks 2-3)**

This stage is about making good choices easier and bad choices harder. If you have to use willpower to make the right decision, your environment is working against you.

I added friction to bad habits and removed friction from good ones. Phone went in a drawer across the room (friction for mindless scrolling). Workout clothes laid out the night before (no friction for morning exercise).

I restructured my environment so the right choice was the obvious choice. Healthy snacks at eye level in the fridge, junk food in hard-to-reach places. Books on my nightstand, TV remote in another room.

I eliminated daily decisions by making them once in advance. Same breakfast every day, workout scheduled at the same time, work clothes laid out Sunday night.

I surrounded myself with people whose normal behavior aligned with my goals. Joined a morning gym where everyone worked out early. Found friends who read books instead of binge watching Netflix.

After just 2 weeks of environmental changes, I noticed I was making better choices without trying. The decisions that used to drain my willpower became automatic.

**Habit formation Weeks 4-8)**

Now we build systems that run on autopilot instead of willpower. The goal is to make desired behaviors so automatic that NOT doing them feels weird.

I started with habits so small they felt ridiculous to skip. One pushup after brushing my teeth. Reading one paragraph before bed. Writing one sentence in my journal.

The size isn't the point - consistency is. You're training your brain that ""this is just what we do now.""

I attached new habits to existing automatic behaviors. After I pour my morning coffee (existing habit), I immediately read for 10 minutes (new habit). After I sit at my desk (existing), I write for 5 minutes (new).

Instead of ""I'm trying to work out more,"" I told myself ""I'm someone who never skips a workout."" Your actions follow your identity, not your goals. When something is part of who you are, you don't need willpower to do it.

As habits became automatic, I gradually increased the duration or intensity. One pushup became five, then ten, then a full workout. But only after the behavior was completely automatic.

By week 6, I had 5 habits running on autopilot that previously required massive willpower battles.

Maintaining progress Weeks 9+)

The final stage is maintaining these systems and troubleshooting when life throws curveballs. Even the best systems need maintenance and adjustment.

I planned for obstacles in advance.  When traveling I packed resistance bands and identified hotel gyms. When sick I maintained habits at minimum viable level (one pushup counts). When stressed I focused on keystone habits that keep other habits intact. Like meditation to keep my mind cool.

I scheduled my most important tasks during my peak willpower hours (usually 8-11 AM for me). Everything else got automated systems or was moved to high-energy times.

Monthly reviews to identify where willpower was creeping back in. If I found myself ""grinding through"" something consistently, I redesigned the system to make it easier.

As habits became effortless, I used the freed-up mental energy for new challenges. But only one major change at a time - your willpower budget is still limited.

**Around week 8, something shifted. I realized I hadn't ""motivated myself"" to work out in weeks. I hadn't ""forced myself"" to eat healthy. These behaviors had become as automatic as brushing my teeth.**

Most willpower advice is backwards. ""Discipline yourself"" and ""just push through"" drain your limited mental energy faster. Motivational content gives you a temporary high but doesn't change your underlying systems.

What works is eliminating the need for willpower through environmental design, habit automation, and energy management. The most disciplined people aren't grinding through resistance - they've eliminated the resistance.

Morning routines work not because mornings are magical, but because your willpower is highest then. Use that peak energy to set up systems, not burn through it on decision-making.

Common mistakes to avoid:

Doing everything at once. Your willpower budget can't handle overhauling your entire life simultaneously. Change one system at a time until it's automatic.

Relying on motivation. Motivation is an emotion that comes and goes. Systems work regardless of how you feel.

Staying or keeping environment bad. If your environment requires constant willpower to make good choices, the environment will win long-term.

Trying to be perfect. Missing one day doesn't ruin your system. Trying to be perfect burns out your willpower faster than anything else.

My results:

I now maintain 12 different positive habits without thinking about them. I work out 6 days a week, read daily, eat healthy, wake up early, and stay focused - all without internal battles or having to pump myself with motivation.

More importantly, I have abundant mental energy for creative work and important decisions because I'm not wasting it on automatic behaviors.

Systems are key.

**TLDR:**

* The problem is willpower dependency, not lack of discipline: Your brain has limited mental energy called ""ego depletion"" that gets drained by every decision and act of self-control throughout the day. By afternoon, your willpower is running on fumes, which is why you make poor choices despite good intentions. Most people try to build more willpower when the real solution is eliminating the need for willpower through environmental design and habit automation. Research shows people with the best self-control don't use willpower more - they use it less by making good choices automatic.
* Stage 1: Map your willpower (Week 1): Track every decision requiring mental effort for one week - most people make 200+ willpower-dependent choices daily without realizing it. Map your energy patterns to identify your 2-3 hours of peak willpower (usually mornings) versus when you're running on mental fumes. Identify specific situations where you consistently fail despite good intentions (late-night snacking, morning phone scrolling, skipping workouts). This audit reveals where your mental energy is being wasted and when you're most vulnerable to poor decisions.
* Stage 2: Redesign your environment (Weeks 2-3): Add friction to bad habits and remove friction from good ones - put your phone in a drawer but lay out workout clothes the night before. Restructure your environment so the right choice is the obvious choice through strategic placement and choice architecture. Eliminate daily decisions through batch processing - same breakfast daily, pre-scheduled workouts, clothes laid out in advance. Design your social environment around people whose normal behavior aligns with your goals. After 2 weeks, good choices become automatic without willpower battles.
* Stage 3: Install systems for habits (Weeks 4-8): Start with micro-habits so small they feel ridiculous to skip (one pushup, one paragraph) to train consistency over intensity. Use habit stacking by attaching new behaviors to existing automatic ones (after morning coffee, immediately read for 10 minutes). Shift identity from ""trying to work out more"" to ""I'm someone who never skips workouts"" since actions follow identity, not goals. Gradually increase intensity only after behaviors become completely automatic. By week 6, multiple habits run on autopilot without willpower requirements.
* Stage 4: Maintaining your habits (Weeks 9+): Plan failure protocols in advance for obstacles like travel, illness, or stress - maintain habits at minimum viable levels to preserve automation. Schedule important tasks during peak willpower hours while using automated systems for everything else. Conduct monthly audits to identify where willpower is creeping back in and redesign those systems. Only add new major changes one at a time since your willpower budget remains limited. The goal is using freed-up mental energy for creative work and important decisions rather than automatic behaviors.
* Long-term principles: The most disciplined people aren't grinding through resistance - they've eliminated the resistance through superior systems. Common mistakes include trying to change everything at once (overwhelming your willpower budget), relying on motivation (an unreliable emotion), fighting your environment instead of designing it, and perfectionism that burns out willpower faster than anything else. Success comes from needing less willpower, not having more of it, by making desired behaviors as automatic as brushing your teeth.

## 💸 Realistic Profit Expectations: What Can You Earn?

Let’s address the elephant in the room: **Can you really earn up to \$1,000 per day with just a \$250 deposit?**

### 📈 What the Data Suggests:

* **Average win rate**: 85–90% on mid-volatility pairs
* **Max drawdown protection**: Customizable stop-loss ensures consistent capital protection

It’s important to note that while **\$1,000/day is achievable**, especially during high-volume trading days, this typically happens when the AI has:

1. Accumulated at least 3–5 days of user trading history to optimize its settings
2. Operated in a high-volatility window (e.g., post-economic announcements)

---

## 🧭 Strategy Behind the AI

* Momentum trading
* Technical breakout patterns
* News-based sentiment shifts
* Market reversal triggers

This multi-pillar approach ensures that the AI can adapt even when one trading style underperforms. It's also why **performance remains stable even during crypto bear markets**.

Served in the Army as a medic, graduated from college more than once and raised 7 kids, four of them female.

So, at what point did I automatically become a misogynist?  Walk into Starbucks, order coffee, say please and thank you and go to check my email and here one of the barista's say how creepy it is for older males to come in here.  
Walk into the library at the local community college where I take classes and get hostile looks, like, WTF are you doing here.

I'm actually afraid to take one of my granddaughters to the local park or forest preserve without my wife or adult daughter present because I know someone would report some old dude with a little girl.

The worst part is this is the exact opposite of what I was taught until I retired.  I worked for an airline which I won't name that was called the LUV airline that had a culture which made me uncomfortable when I first started there.  My Army background didn't make me into a hugger, but I accepted it (eventually).  Now, when I do the things I was taught, (i.e. smile, call people by their names, often on service workers uniforms) it increases the Ick/creepy factor a thousand percent.

So, what are the options - never look any female in the eyes again, never say hi, please or thank you or compliment someone on making a coffee right?  Thank you for actually delivering my package to the box that says Amazon on it?  Never thank a bagger for double bagging something.

Moving to Boston for school (3years) with a toddler! 


I’ll be moving to Boston in a few weeks and we’re elated! Originally from the south, we’re excited to finally be in a walkable city! 

1) I’m looking at two complexes, both with in unit laundry. One is a building from the 1800s that’s been renovated and it’s about 4 minutes from campus. The other is a newer skyscraper with modern amenities but it’s a fifteen minute walk. 

How bad is walking in the snow or on rainy days? 

2) I’m familiar with the usual delivery apps like Instacart, DoorDash etc. Does Boston have some apps that work best? 

3) my wardrobe is devoid of winter clothing for the snow. 
What’re some must haves- e.g winter boots that are waterproof? Trench coats? Heavy parkas? 

4) we’re thinking it might be helpful to move our car here in a few months once we’re comfortable with the city? Thinking larger grocery hauls, visiting family out of state in NY, NJ and PA and possible trips up to Canada. How is the car rental market and the occasional zip car rentals? 

5) I’ll be applying for loans while I can and I’m looking for tips that’ll support a frugal lifestyle? Free coffee? Cheaper groceries? Cheap healthcare until we have insurance? 

Thanks everyone, super excited for the move!

3 weeks ago I ordered the reusable filter for my Brew + Chill. It got stuck in pre-shipment at USPS and never arrived. They sent me a new one which arrived today and I was SO excited to finally have fresh, local coffee with my Keurig UNTIL I found out it doesn’t fit! This was indeed the updated one that is supposed to be compatible with multistream and the Brew + Chill. However, I quickly noticed that pictures included with many online reviews AND Keurig’s own google ad did not match the appearance of the filter I received. 🤔 I called support, the nice lady understood the issue and ordered me the correct filter.

I had a table request diet soda options. My restaurant only carries Diet Coke and Coke Zero as I’m pretty sure that’s the standard. Anyways, I suggested these to my guest who proceeded to complain that we don’t have more options available. Genuinely what other options even exist? I know a few fast food places have those big red soda machines with a ton of options, but I’ve never heard of a sit down restaurant having one of those. Every place I’ve worked has only carried a standard soda machine with a few basic options. The only other one I could think of that we didn’t have would be Diet Dr Pepper, but they didn’t even want that. I even suggested unsweet tea and coffee. Nothing was good enough. It took them a long time to simply decide on a drink. If we don’t carry what you like then why not just get water? What’s wrong with drinking water? Why do you need a soda that badly? 

The guest proceeded to complain about the food as well and send it back. I was expecting it based on the absurd amount of stupid questions I was asked regarding the food and the amount of dirty looks I was given.

Drugs – Indonesia imposes harsh penalties for drug trafficking and use. But in the province of Aceh, marijuana is ever-present.  ""Young people like me use it to cook tempeh.""

 
Author : Saskia Konniger 

After passing the knife sharpener, chicken vendors, and the maker of the traditional kopiah headgear, the aroma of curry fills the air. At the market in the Acehnese village of Sibreh, half an hour from the provincial capital Banda Aceh, a handful of cooks prepare their family recipes in large pans under the beams of wooden shelters. Beef or goat meat simmered in a sauce of  ""onions, garlic, tomatoes, coriander, chili peppers, ginger, dried coconut, and coconut milk,""  lists the sixty-year-old curry cook. Any special ingredient today?  ""Not today,"" the man replies mischievously as he stirs a steaming pan of goat curry.  



The ingredient he won’t name aloud is the seeds and leaves of  Cannabis sativa .  ""If I added more than four spoonfuls to this pan, we’d be flying,"" he says.  ""But just a little makes the meat tender and deepens the flavor.""  
Villagers confirm its culinary use. A goat seller chuckles and walks away. No one dares say it outright, but nearly every household cooks with marijuana leaves and seeds for special occasions.  ""It’s good for diabetes,"" says a marketgoer holding a bunch of onions. Her family also cooks with cannabis.  ""Most family dishes won’t get you high,""  adds a young onion seller beside her.  ""At most, a bit sleepy.""  And the buds? Are those used too?  ""Young people like me use them to fry tempeh when camping with friends,"" the onion seller admits, speaking anonymously.  



Because using, growing, or trading weed is strictly forbidden in Indonesia. There’s no distinction between soft and hard drugs. Getting caught with a bag of weed can land you 4 to 12 years in prison. Drug trafficking carries the death penalty. Aceh enforces strict Islamic Sharia law, yet it’s also home to a centuries-old cannabis culture. One theory holds that the Dutch brought Cannabis sativa from India and planted it among coffee crops in Aceh’s Gayo highlands to repel insects.  


Muscle aches and toothaches  

Historian Masykur Syafruddin (28), founder of the Pedir Museum in Banda Aceh, says Acehnese grew cannabis long before the Dutch arrived. Carefully, he lays out yellowed manuscripts on the floor. Raised in a family of Islamic scholars, he’s collected ancient coins and texts since his teens, particularly those on lifestyles.  ""Opium and marijuana were popular in the sultanate era,""  he says—as flavoring, but mostly as medicine.  ""I’ve found many recipes for muscle pain and toothaches."" 



Marijuana was accepted across society.  ""Even in the margins of religious texts, you’ll find scribbled recipes with cannabis."" The historian, fluent in the old Jawi script, holds up a crumbling document.  ""This is an 1870 import tariff list for the Ottoman Sultan. Look, here’s the tax rate for cannabis."" He pulls out a 1920s Dutch history book.  ""Thanks to you, it became illegal. In 1927, the Dutch—where it’s now legal—banned marijuana here. That law was never repealed.""  


Medical use


Yet Aceh has growing support for legalization. Biochemist Professor Musri Musman of Syiah Kuala University has publicly advocated for medical cultivation, publishing on the healing effects of CBD and highlighting economic benefits for Acehnese farmers—like hemp for clothing and cosmetics. 



Some Acehnese politicians also push for legal farming.  ""Back then, everyone had a plant or two,"" says a local politician in Banda Aceh, picking at his nasi goreng .  ""Hemp is a natural pesticide—keeps ants and bugs away."" His family also cooks with cannabis.  ""Sometimes seeds just blow onto your land,""  he laughs. He supports legalization for Aceh’s economy and knows others in politics agree.  



In 2020, conservative Muslim party politician Rafli Kande openly backed medical cannabis farming, arguing legal exports could boost Aceh’s economy. But backlash silenced him. The debate flared again in 2024.  


""Special noodles""


Rumors swirled in Banda Aceh that certain restaurants served  ""special noodle dishes.""  Crowds lined up—just as the city prepared for a national sports event. Anti-drug police (BNN) ramped up raids, testing diners for drugs. One man tested positive for THC after unknowingly eating a cannabis-laced meal, a police chief said.   ""Imagine an athlete failing a drug test because of a restaurant dish."" The legalization debate was swiftly suppressed.  


Despite crackdowns, Aceh remains a drug trafficking hub. In October, a gang was caught smuggling 642 kg of dried weed to Jakarta. Months earlier, police destroyed 1.3 tons of marijuana and 226 kg of crystal meth, boasting they’d ""saved 1.3 million Indonesian users.""


Yet in Acehnese homes, marijuana is losing ground to methamphetamine, flooding Southeast Asia from Myanmar. UNODC reports a record 190 tons seized in East/Southeast Asia in 2024. Researchers say meth use is rampant among laborers, who take it to stay awake and suppress hunger.  

Crystal meth


In Sibreh, the curry cook says meth is far more destructive than ancestral cannabis cooking. ""Users steal—first from family, then neighbors—to fund their shabu [meth].""


A Banda Aceh mechanic (45), once a dealer, recalls the shift from weed to meth. His family grew cannabis; his mother cooked with it. He started with joints, then sold his own crop. ""It was easy money—no police."" But after Aceh’s civil war intensified in the 1990s, the army cracked down, suspecting rebels traded weed for weapons.  


Post-2004 tsunami, meth arrived with aid groups.  ""I tried a meth pipe—nothing like weed. I couldn’t sleep or eat for days.""  Soon, he sold meth for a gang, earning $6,000 daily—then watching others rot.  ""Their teeth fell out. I quit before I went mad."" He still smokes weed occasionally and believes it should be legal,  ""like in the Netherlands."" But now,  ""police wait for harvests, seize the crop, and ‘lose’ it.""  He calls penalties unfair:   ""Meth dealers walk free; poor weed smokers stay jailed.""


A dead-end road


Jurist Aristo Pangaribuan says Indonesia’s legal system is flawed but won’t change soon.  ""Every time someone advocates legalizing soft drugs, uproar follows. Religious views—Muslim and Christian—call mind-altering substances sinful.""


Harsh penalties overcrowd prisons. President Prabowo recently freed 44,000 inmates (a third drug offenders) to ease conditions—but the laws stand. Pangaribuan adds police profit from the system, extorting suspects or pocketing seized drugs. Recently, 18 officers were arrested for shaking down festivalgoers in Jakarta, netting €140,000.  


""Special ingredient""


At Bardi Restaurant near Banda Aceh, two Jakarta women enjoy pasta. Why here?  ""We heard they serve food with a ‘special ingredient,’"" says Vindy (42). Accountants Novi (26) and Vindy (Indonesians often use single names) wanted to try  ""those special noodles."" Feeling anything? They giggle:  ""Not yet!"" The manager denies any drugs in the food. Outside, a neighbor scoffs:  ""Of course there’s nothing. It’s just a smart PR stunt.""",43,1749261206.0,indonesia,17,0.98,False

I unlock the door, and the familiar creak greets me—not a cheerful bark from a dog, not a smile from someone waiting. Just silence. The kind of silence that wraps around you like a cold blanket, reminding you that you’re alone. 

I kick off my shoes and shuffle into the living room, my sanctuary, but it feels more like a prison sometimes. My pillows are my only companions, and while they’re soft and comfortable, they don’t offer much in the way of conversation or warmth. I plop down on the couch, surrounded by the remnants of my independence—my laptop, my coffee mug, and that stack of work I promised myself I’d get through. Yet, it all feels empty.

I’ve built a life that I’m proud of. I work hard, I pay my bills, and I’ve created a cozy space that reflects who I am. People tell me that being independent is empowering, and it is, to an extent. But there’s a gnawing loneliness that creeps in when the sun sets and the world outside grows quiet. I scroll through my phone, half-hoping for a message, a sign that someone is thinking of me. But there’s nothing. Just me and my thoughts, spiraling into a familiar cycle of “Why am I still single?”

I remind myself that being single is a choice, a chance to focus on myself. I can go wherever I want, do whatever I please. But the truth is, independence loses its luster when you realize it’s just you. There’s no one to share the little victories with—no one to celebrate when I nail a presentation or finish a tough project. Instead, it’s just me, pouring myself a glass of wine, pretending to toast to myself. 

I try to fill the silence with music or a podcast, but it’s never quite enough. I want hugs, kisses, the gentle touch of someone who cares. I want to come home to someone who’s been waiting, someone who lights up when I walk through the door. Instead, I get the same old routine: work, eat, collapse onto the couch, and binge-watch something to drown out the loneliness.

Some days, it feels like I’m living in a bubble, surrounded by couples and families who seem to have it all figured out. I see them laughing, sharing meals, and it stings. I wonder if they realize how lucky they are, or if they take it for granted. I want to scream, “Hey, I’m here! I’m doing my best, but it gets so lonely sometimes!” 

I know I should embrace my independence, focus on my career, and nurture my friendships. But the truth is, it’s hard. It’s hard to be strong all the time when you crave connection. I remind myself that this phase won’t last forever, that one day I might find someone who makes coming home feel different. 

But tonight, I’m just here with my pillows, staring at the ceiling, wondering if this is all there is. I’ll eventually get up, tackle my work, and put on a brave face for the world. But deep down, I can’t shake the feeling that being independent and single, while empowering, can also be incredibly lonely.",1,1749261161.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False
1l59hwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1l59hwo/do_weights_hide_hyperbolic_trees_a_quick/,"Do weights hide ""hyperbolic trees”? A quick coffee-rant and an ask for open science (long)","Every morning I grab a cup of coffee and read all the papers I can for at least 3 hours.

You guys probably read the latest Meta paper that says we can ""store"" almost 4 bits per param as some sort of ""constant"" in LLMs.

**What if I told you that there are similar papers in neurobiology?** Similar constants have been found in biological neurons - some neuro papers show that CA1 synapses pack around 4.7 bits per synapse. While it could be a coincidence, none of this is random though it is slightly apples-to-oranges.

And the best part of this is that since we have access to the open weights, we can test many of the hypothesis available. There's no need to go full crank territory when we can do open collaborative science.

After looking at the meta paper, for some reason I tried to match the constant to something that would make sense to me. The constant is around 3.6 with some flexibility, which approaches (2−ϕ) \* 10. So, we can more or less define the ""memory capacity function"" of an LLM like f​(p) ≈ (2−ϕ) ⋅ 10 ⋅ p. Where p is the parameter count and 10 is pure curve-fitting.

The 3.6 bits is probably the *Shannon/Kolmogorov* information the model can store **about a dataset**, not raw mantissa bits. And could be architecture/precision dependent so i don't know.

This is probably all wrong and just a coincidence but take it as an ""operational"" starting point of sorts. (2−ϕ) is not a random thing, it's a number on which evolution falls when doing phyllotaxis to generate the rotation ""spawn points"" of leaves to maximize coverage.

What if the nature of the learning process is making the LLMs converge on these ""constants"" (as in magic numbers from CS) to maximize their goals. I'm not claiming a golden angle shows up, rather some patterned periodicity that makes sense in a high dimensional weight space.

Correct me if I'm wrong here, but what if this is here to optimize some other geometry? not every parameter vector is nailed to a perfect unit sphere, but activation vectors that matter for attention get RMS- or ℓ₂-normalised, so they live on a thin hyperspherical shell

I don't know what 10 is here, but this could be distributing memorization across every new param/leaf in a hypersphere. each new head / embedding direction wants to overlap as little as possible with the ones already there

afaik this could all be pure numerology, but the angle is kind of there

Now I found some guy (link below) that seems to have found some evidence of hyperbolic distributions in the weights. Again, hyperbolic structures have been already found on biological brains. While these are not the same, maybe the way the information reaches them creates some sort of emerging encoding structure.

This hyperbolic tail does not necessarily imply proof of curvature, but we can test for it (Hyperbolic-SVD curvature fit).

Holistically speaking, since we train on data that is basically a projection of our world models, the training should (kind of) create some sort of ""reverse engineered"" holographic representation of that world model, of which we acquire a string of symbols - via inference - that represents a slice of that.

Then it seems as if bio/bit networks converge on ""sphere-rim coverage + hyperbolic interior"" because that maximizes memory and routing efficiency under sparse wiring budgets.

\---

**If this holds true (to some extent), then this is useful data to both optimize our training runs and our quantization methods**.

\+ If we identify where the ""trunks"" vs the ""twigs"" are, we can keep the trunks in 8 bits and prune the twigs to 4 bit (or less). (compare k\_eff-based pruning to magnitude pruning; if no win, k\_eff is useless)

\+ If ""golden-angle packing"" is real, many twigs could be near-duplicates. 

\+ If a given ""tree"" stops growing, we could freeze it.

\+  Since ""memory capacity"" scales linearly with param count, and if every new weight vector lands on a hypersphere with minimal overlap (think 137° leaf spiral in 4 D), linear scaling drops out naturally. As far as i read, the models in the Meta paper were small.

\+ Plateau at \~3.6 bpp is *independent* of dataset size (once big enough).  A sphere has only so much surface area; after that, you can’t pack new “directions” without stepping on toes -> switch to interior tree-branches = generalization.

\+ if curvature really < 0, Negative curvature says the matrix behaves like a tree embedded in hyperbolic space, so a Lorentz low-rank factor (U, V, R) might shave parameters versus plain UVᵀ.

\---

I’m usually an obscurantist, but these hypotheses are too easy to test to keep private and could help all of us in these commons, if by any chance this pseudo-coffee-rant helps you get some research ideas that is more than enough for me.

Maybe to start with, someone should dump key/query vectors and histogram for the golden angles

If anyone has the means, please rerun Meta’s capacity probe—to see if the 3.6 bpp plateau holds?

**All of this is falsifiable, so go ahead and kill it with data**

Thanks for reading my rant, have a nice day/night/whatever

All last week I felt like I had a bad case of indigestion and constipation.  Wednesday during the day my stomach hurt pretty good, but by late afternoon it felt a little better, even went on a short bicycle ride with some friends (20 miles).  Saturday my wife and I were going to do a 60 mile ride but I could only do 40, I was flat out exhausted and couldn’t figure out why.  Sunday I was really out of it, exhausted, hardly got off the couch or my bed, and had taken a shit since Thursday.  And it wasn’t much of one given how much I had been eating.  

My wife rocks and went to the store and got me some laxatives, as we were getting a little nervous, we were scheduled to go on a vacation to Norway with my mom, sister, and her husband and kids on Wednesday.  I wanted whatever was going on resolved before then because I didn’t want it to fix itself while on the 12 hour flight if you know what I mean.  No one wants to be the guy that forces a transatlantic flight to do an emergency landing because they shit all over the place.  I drank all that she brought home and prayed for the best.

I hardly slept at all Sunday night on into Monday morning anxiously waiting for the laxatives to do their thing.  Finally early Monday morning it was game on.  I felt so much better after recreating that one scene from Dumb and Dumber.  I called in sick to work just to be safe as in if the laxatives had a round two or three in store for me, and because I needed the rest.  Progressively through the day my stomach started to hurt again and I was thinking uh oh.  

I woke up Tuesday morning around 4:30 due to the pain and decided to go in.  The Urgent Care at the hospital didn’t open until 7:00 so I got myself comfortable on the couch and drank a little coffee.  As I was heading out the door my wife asked if I wanted her to come with and at first I said no, but then thought for a second and changed my mind.

We made the hour drive to the hospital (we live in a rural area) and got there just before they opened.  I got checked in and was seen by a Dr right away, and I explained my symptoms.  He ordered a blood test and did the usual things like listened to my stomach, put a finger up my butt, etc.  He also ordered a CT scan, which piqued my curiosity about what was really going on.  

Shortly after the blood draw and CT scan my wife asked for my phone and she opened up our hospitals app and saw that my blood sample results were already live on it.  A couple things were off the charts so we googled it and everything came back saying that I had an infection.  At this time we started txting my family saying something is up and we’ll keep them posted.

The nurse came back in and hooked me up to an IV with a hurried pace which further made me think that things weren’t quite normal.  The Dr. came back in and introduced us to another Dr., the surgeon on duty.  The surgeon said he wasn’t sure how I was walking, talking, and didn’t have a fever because my appendix had burst.  As in last week, possibly as early as Wednesday.  The CT showed that the infection had spread to my colon and that if they operated right then and there I would lose about 1/3 of it.  

I’m thinking welp, looks like I’m not going to Norway.  I end up getting admitted to the hospital, put on a clear liquid diet, and started a regiment of antibiotics.  The surgeon said that during COVID hospitals were slammed and couldn’t always do appendix surgery right away, so they would give patients a heavy dose of antibiotics until they could fit them in and found that in about 90% of cases it worked really well.  He said that if all goes well with me going this route then when he does operate on me he’ll only need to remove my appendix.  We’re all for this as the recovery time is significantly shorter and there’s less chance of complications.

My brother in-law is a rockstar not only because he did all the planning for the trip, but he was able to cancel everything and get refunded.  And to top it off everyone came up to visit me in the hospital. 

During my three day, two night stay I got stable enough to go home so here we are now.  Taking it easy, eating antibiotics like they are Pez candies, and waiting for my next Dr. appointment when we can reassess my status and schedule the surgery.  I’m hopeful to get it done sooner than later because sitting on the couch in summer is killing me.  I just want to go ride my bike.

Looks like we’re going to shoot for next June for attempt number two for Norway which we’re all really looking forward to.  I’m glad I went in before we left too because who wants to end up spending all of their vacation in a hospital in a foreign country.

TL;DR: Had a burst appendix, didn’t display normal symptoms so I didn’t bother getting it checked out, and eventually wound up getting admitted to the hospital the day before my entire family was supposed to go on a trip to Norway.",98,1749260762.0,tifu,23,0.92,False

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

It also has a some relatively large cracks along the bottom (see second photo). Should I try to fill them with epoxy? I'm going for a lighter, more natural finish, so if I do use some sort epoxy, I'm not sure what shade/color would look best.

I've never been a fan of coffee since before and would always react badly after having coffee (think diarrhea because of the milk). 

Fast forward to 2025, I started taking medication which affected my taste. Drinks which I previously enjoyed like green tea and milo ais were tainted with weird aftertaste. Fortunately, water was still good ol water.

But sometimes, I get hit with cravings. I get reminded of one time as a kid I was at a kopitiam eating my roti pisang and I tried my first kopitiam kopi. A strong, *pekat* and bitter kopi that leaves quite an aftertaste.

So I asked a friend for some recommendations and was told to check out kopi gajah and kopi tupai. Tried both and I prefer kopi gajah personally because the taste more pekat.

With that out of the way, any other recommendations for local ground coffee? I am by no means a coffee aficionado so please be patient with me lol.

1l59239,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs_Archive/comments/1l59239/wsj_the_pentagon_disinformation_that_fueled/,WSJ - The Pentagon Disinformation That Fueled America’s UFO Mythology,"U.S. military fabricated evidence of alien technology and allowed rumors to fester to cover up real secret-weapons programs


A tiny Pentagon office had spent months investigating conspiracy theories about secret Washington UFO programs when it uncovered a shocking truth: At least one of those theories had been fueled by the Pentagon itself. 

The congressionally ordered probe took investigators back to the 1980s, when an Air Force colonel visited a bar near Area 51, a top-secret site in the Nevada desert. He gave the owner photos of what might be flying saucers. The photos went up on the walls, and into the local lore went the idea that the U.S. military was secretly testing recovered alien technology.

But the colonel was on a mission—of disinformation. The photos were doctored, the now-retired officer confessed to the Pentagon investigators in 2023. The whole exercise was a ruse to protect what was really going on at Area 51: The Air Force was using the site to develop top-secret stealth fighters, viewed as a critical edge against the Soviet Union. Military leaders were worried that the programs might get exposed if locals somehow glimpsed a test flight of, say, the F-117 stealth fighter, an aircraft that truly did look out of this world. Better that they believe it came from Andromeda.

This episode, reported now for the first time, was just one of a series of discoveries the Pentagon team made as it investigated decades of claims that Washington was hiding what it knew about extraterrestrial life. That effort culminated in a report, released last year by the Defense Department, that found allegations of a government coverup to be baseless.

In fact, a Wall Street Journal investigation reveals, the report itself amounted to a coverup—but not in the way the UFO conspiracy industry would have people believe. The public disclosure left out the truth behind some of the foundational myths about UFOs: The Pentagon itself sometimes deliberately fanned the flames, in what amounted to the U.S. government targeting its own citizens with disinformation.

At the same time, the very nature of Pentagon operations—an opaque bureaucracy that kept secret programs embedded within secret programs, cloaked in cover stories—created fertile ground for the myths to spread.

These findings represent a stunning new twist in the story of America’s cultural obsession with UFOs. In the decades after a 1938 radio broadcast of H.G. Wells’ “The War of the Worlds” spread panic throughout the country, speculation about alien visitors remained largely the province of supermarket tabloids, Hollywood blockbusters and costumed conferences in Las Vegas. 

More recently, things took an ominous turn when a handful of former Pentagon officials went public with allegations of a government program to exploit extraterrestrial technology and hide it from Americans. Those claims led to the Pentagon’s investigation.

Now, evidence is emerging that government efforts to propagate UFO mythology date back all the way to the 1950s. 

This account is based on interviews with two dozen current and former U.S. officials, scientists and military contractors involved in the inquiry, as well as thousands of pages of documents, recordings, emails and text messages. 

At times, as with the deception around Area 51, military officers spread false documents to create a smokescreen for real secret-weapons programs. In other cases, officials allowed UFO myths to take root in the interest of national security—for instance, to prevent the Soviet Union from detecting vulnerabilities in the systems protecting nuclear installations. Stories tended to take on a life of their own, such as the three-decade journey of a purported piece of space metal that turned out to be nothing of the sort. And one long-running practice was more like a fraternity hazing ritual that spun wildly out of control.

Investigators are still trying to determine whether the spread of disinformation was the act of local commanders and officers or a more centralized, institutional program. 

The Pentagon omitted key facts in the public version of the 2024 report that could have helped put some UFO rumors to rest, both to protect classified secrets and to avoid embarrassment, the Journal investigation found. The Air Force in particular pushed to omit some details it believed could jeopardize secret programs and damage careers.

The lack of full transparency has only given more fuel to conspiracy theories. Members of Congress have formed a caucus, composed mainly of Republicans, to examine unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP, in bureaucratic speak. The caucus has demanded the intelligence community disclose which agencies “are involved with UAP crash retrieval programs.”

MAGA skepticism about the “deep state” further feeds the notion that government bureaucrats have been keeping those secrets from the American public. At a November hearing of two House Oversight subcommittees, Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, cast doubt on the Pentagon’s report. “I’m not a mathematician, but I can tell you that doesn’t add up,” she said. 

Sean Kirkpatrick, a precise, bespectacled scientist who once spent years studying vibrations in laser crystals, was nearing retirement from government service when he received the call that would change his life.

By 2022 he had ascended to chief scientist at the Missile and Space Intelligence Center at the Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville, Ala. As he sat at his desk at 6:30 one morning, drinking coffee and skimming through intelligence reports that had come in overnight, his Tandberg desk phone—essentially a classified version of FaceTime—rang. 

It was a deputy undersecretary from the Pentagon, who was putting on a tie as he told Kirkpatrick about a new office Congress ordered the department to set up to examine unidentified anomalous phenomena. “The undersecretary and I put together a shortlist of who could do it, and you’re at the top,” the official relayed, adding that they had settled on Kirkpatrick because he both had a scientific background and had built a half-dozen organizations within the intelligence community.

Is that the real reason, Kirkpatrick countered, “or am I the only one stupid enough to say, ‘yes?’”
In short order, Kirkpatrick had the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office up and running. Just the latest in an alphabet soup of special government projects set up to study UFOs stretching back more than half a century, AARO, as it is known, operated out of an unmarked office near the Pentagon, with a few dozen staffers and a classified budget.
The mission fell into two buckets. One was to collect data on sightings, particularly around military installations, and assess whether they could be explained by earthly technology. Amid growing public attention, the number of such reports has skyrocketed in recent years,  to 757 in the 12 months after May 2023 from 144 between 2004 to 2021. AARO linked most of the incidents to balloons, birds and the proliferation of drones cluttering the skies.
 Many pilot accounts of floating orbs were actually reflections of the sun from Starlink satellites, investigators found. They are still examining whether some unexplained events could be foreign technology, such as Chinese aircraft using next-generation cloaking methods that distort their appearance. 

The office found that some seemingly inexplicable events weren’t so strange after all. In one, a 2015 video appeared to show a spherical object buzzing past a jet fighter at an almost impossible speed. “Oh, my gosh dude,” the pilot can be heard saying in the video, laughing. But later, investigators determined there was nothing much to see—whatever the object was, the camera angle and relative speed of the jet had made it appear to be going much faster than it was.
The office’s second mission proved to be more peculiar: to review the historical record going back to 1945 to assess the claims made by dozens of former military employees that Washington operated a secret program to harvest alien technology. Congress granted the office unprecedented access to America’s most highly classified programs to allow Kirkpatrick’s team to run the stories to ground. 
As Kirkpatrick pursued his investigation, he started to uncover a hall of mirrors within the Pentagon, cloaked in official and nonofficial cover. On one level, the secrecy was understandable. The U.S., after all, had been locked in an existential battle with the Soviet Union for decades, each side determined to win the upper hand in the race for ever-more-exotic weapons. 
But Kirkpatrick soon discovered that some of the obsession with secrecy verged on the farcical. A former Air Force officer was visibly terrified when he told Kirkpatrick’s investigators that he had been briefed on a secret alien project decades earlier, and was warned that if he ever repeated the secret he could be jailed or executed. The claim would be repeated to investigators by other men who had never spoken of the matter, even with their spouses. 
It turned out the witnesses had been victims of a bizarre hazing ritual. 
For decades, certain new commanders of the Air Force’s most classified programs, as part of their induction briefings, would be handed a piece of paper with a photo of what looked like a flying saucer. The craft was described as an antigravity maneuvering vehicle. 

The officers were told that the program they were joining, dubbed Yankee Blue, was part of an effort to reverse-engineer the technology on the craft. They were told never to mention it again. Many never learned it was fake. Kirkpatrick found the practice had begun decades before, and appeared to continue still. The defense secretary’s office sent a memo out across the service in the spring of 2023 ordering the practice to stop immediately, but the damage was done. 
Investigators are still trying to determine why officers had misled subordinates, whether as some type of loyalty test, a more deliberate attempt to deceive or something else.  
After that 2023 discovery, Kirkpatrick’s deputy briefed President Joe Biden’s director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, who was stunned.
Could this be the basis for the persistent belief that the U.S. has an alien program that we’ve concealed from the American people? Haines wanted to know, according to people familiar with the matter. How extensive was it? she asked.  
The official responded: “Ma’am, we know it went on for decades. We are talking about hundreds and hundreds of people. These men signed NDAs. They thought it was real.“
The finding could have been devastating to the Air Force. The service was particularly sensitive to the allegations of hazing and asked that AARO hold off on including the finding in the public report, even after Kirkpatrick had briefed lawmakers on the episode. Kirkpatrick retired before that report was finished and released.  
In a statement, a Defense Department spokeswoman acknowledged that AARO had uncovered evidence of fake classified program materials relating to extraterrestrials, and had briefed lawmakers and intelligence officials. The spokeswoman, Sue Gough, said the department didn’t include that information in its report last year because the investigation wasn’t completed, but expects to provide it in another report scheduled for later this year.
“The department is committed to releasing a second volume of its Historical Record Report, to include AARO’s findings on reports of potential pranks and inauthentic materials,” Gough said.  

Kirkpatrick investigated another mystery that stretched back 60 years. 
In 1967, Robert Salas, now 84, was an Air Force captain sitting in a walk-in closet-sized bunker, manning the controls of 10 nuclear missiles in Montana. 
He was prepared to launch apocalyptic strikes should Soviet Russia ever attack first, and got a call around 8 p.m. one night from the guard station above. A glowing reddish-orange oval was hovering over the front gate, Salas told Kirkpatrick’s investigators. The guards had their rifles drawn, pointed at the oval object appearing to float above the gate. A horn sounded in the bunker, signaling a problem with the control system: All 10 missiles were disabled. 
Salas soon learned a similar event occurred at other silos nearby. Were they under attack? Salas never got an answer. The next morning a helicopter was waiting to take Salas back to base. Once there he was ordered: Never discuss the incident. 

Salas was one of five men interviewed by Kirkpatrick’s team who witnessed such events in the 1960s and ’70s. While sworn to secrecy, the men began sharing their stories in the ’90s in books and documentaries. 
Kirkpatrick’s team dug into the story and discovered a terrestrial explanation. The barriers of concrete and steel surrounding America’s nuclear missiles were thick enough to give them a chance if hit first by a Soviet strike. But scientists at the time feared the intense storm of electromagnetic waves generated by a nuclear detonation might render the hardware needed to launch a counterstrike unusable.

To test this vulnerability, the Air Force developed an exotic electromagnetic generator that simulated this pulse of disruptive energy without the need to detonate a nuclear weapon.
When activated, this device, placed on a portable platform 60 feet above the facility, would gather power until it glowed, sometimes with a blinding orange light. It would then fire a burst of energy that could resemble lightning.

The electromagnetic pulses snaked down cables connected to the bunker where launch commanders like Salas sat, disrupting the guidance systems, disabling the weapons and haunting the men to this day. 
But any public leak of the tests at the time would have allowed Russia to know that America’s nuclear arsenal could be disabled in a first strike. The witnesses were kept in the dark. 
To this day Salas believes he was party to an intergalactic intervention to stop nuclear war which the government has tried to hide. He is half right. The experience left the octogenarian deeply skeptical of the U.S. military and its ability to tell the truth. “There is a gigantic coverup, not only by the Air Force, but every other federal agency that has cognizance of this subject,” he said in an interview with the Journal. “We were never briefed on the activities that were going on, the Air Force shut us out of any information.”
Concealing the truth from men like Salas and deliberate efforts to target the public with disinformation unleashed within the halls of the Pentagon itself a dangerous force, which would become almost unstoppable as decades passed. The paranoid mythology the U.S. military helped spread now has a hold over a growing number of its own senior officials who count themselves as believers.

1l58uui,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1l58uui/wsj_the_pentagon_disinformation_that_fueled/,WSJ - The Pentagon Disinformation That Fueled America’s UFO Mythology,"U.S. military fabricated evidence of alien technology and allowed rumors to fester to cover up real secret-weapons programs


A tiny Pentagon office had spent months investigating conspiracy theories about secret Washington UFO programs when it uncovered a shocking truth: At least one of those theories had been fueled by the Pentagon itself. 

The congressionally ordered probe took investigators back to the 1980s, when an Air Force colonel visited a bar near Area 51, a top-secret site in the Nevada desert. He gave the owner photos of what might be flying saucers. The photos went up on the walls, and into the local lore went the idea that the U.S. military was secretly testing recovered alien technology.

But the colonel was on a mission—of disinformation. The photos were doctored, the now-retired officer confessed to the Pentagon investigators in 2023. The whole exercise was a ruse to protect what was really going on at Area 51: The Air Force was using the site to develop top-secret stealth fighters, viewed as a critical edge against the Soviet Union. Military leaders were worried that the programs might get exposed if locals somehow glimpsed a test flight of, say, the F-117 stealth fighter, an aircraft that truly did look out of this world. Better that they believe it came from Andromeda.

This episode, reported now for the first time, was just one of a series of discoveries the Pentagon team made as it investigated decades of claims that Washington was hiding what it knew about extraterrestrial life. That effort culminated in a report, released last year by the Defense Department, that found allegations of a government coverup to be baseless.

In fact, a Wall Street Journal investigation reveals, the report itself amounted to a coverup—but not in the way the UFO conspiracy industry would have people believe. The public disclosure left out the truth behind some of the foundational myths about UFOs: The Pentagon itself sometimes deliberately fanned the flames, in what amounted to the U.S. government targeting its own citizens with disinformation.

At the same time, the very nature of Pentagon operations—an opaque bureaucracy that kept secret programs embedded within secret programs, cloaked in cover stories—created fertile ground for the myths to spread.

These findings represent a stunning new twist in the story of America’s cultural obsession with UFOs. In the decades after a 1938 radio broadcast of H.G. Wells’ “The War of the Worlds” spread panic throughout the country, speculation about alien visitors remained largely the province of supermarket tabloids, Hollywood blockbusters and costumed conferences in Las Vegas. 

More recently, things took an ominous turn when a handful of former Pentagon officials went public with allegations of a government program to exploit extraterrestrial technology and hide it from Americans. Those claims led to the Pentagon’s investigation.

Now, evidence is emerging that government efforts to propagate UFO mythology date back all the way to the 1950s. 

This account is based on interviews with two dozen current and former U.S. officials, scientists and military contractors involved in the inquiry, as well as thousands of pages of documents, recordings, emails and text messages. 

At times, as with the deception around Area 51, military officers spread false documents to create a smokescreen for real secret-weapons programs. In other cases, officials allowed UFO myths to take root in the interest of national security—for instance, to prevent the Soviet Union from detecting vulnerabilities in the systems protecting nuclear installations. Stories tended to take on a life of their own, such as the three-decade journey of a purported piece of space metal that turned out to be nothing of the sort. And one long-running practice was more like a fraternity hazing ritual that spun wildly out of control.

Investigators are still trying to determine whether the spread of disinformation was the act of local commanders and officers or a more centralized, institutional program. 

The Pentagon omitted key facts in the public version of the 2024 report that could have helped put some UFO rumors to rest, both to protect classified secrets and to avoid embarrassment, the Journal investigation found. The Air Force in particular pushed to omit some details it believed could jeopardize secret programs and damage careers.

The lack of full transparency has only given more fuel to conspiracy theories. Members of Congress have formed a caucus, composed mainly of Republicans, to examine unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP, in bureaucratic speak. The caucus has demanded the intelligence community disclose which agencies “are involved with UAP crash retrieval programs.”

MAGA skepticism about the “deep state” further feeds the notion that government bureaucrats have been keeping those secrets from the American public. At a November hearing of two House Oversight subcommittees, Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, cast doubt on the Pentagon’s report. “I’m not a mathematician, but I can tell you that doesn’t add up,” she said. 

Sean Kirkpatrick, a precise, bespectacled scientist who once spent years studying vibrations in laser crystals, was nearing retirement from government service when he received the call that would change his life.

By 2022 he had ascended to chief scientist at the Missile and Space Intelligence Center at the Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville, Ala. As he sat at his desk at 6:30 one morning, drinking coffee and skimming through intelligence reports that had come in overnight, his Tandberg desk phone—essentially a classified version of FaceTime—rang. 

It was a deputy undersecretary from the Pentagon, who was putting on a tie as he told Kirkpatrick about a new office Congress ordered the department to set up to examine unidentified anomalous phenomena. “The undersecretary and I put together a shortlist of who could do it, and you’re at the top,” the official relayed, adding that they had settled on Kirkpatrick because he both had a scientific background and had built a half-dozen organizations within the intelligence community.

Is that the real reason, Kirkpatrick countered, “or am I the only one stupid enough to say, ‘yes?’”
In short order, Kirkpatrick had the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office up and running. Just the latest in an alphabet soup of special government projects set up to study UFOs stretching back more than half a century, AARO, as it is known, operated out of an unmarked office near the Pentagon, with a few dozen staffers and a classified budget.
The mission fell into two buckets. One was to collect data on sightings, particularly around military installations, and assess whether they could be explained by earthly technology. Amid growing public attention, the number of such reports has skyrocketed in recent years,  to 757 in the 12 months after May 2023 from 144 between 2004 to 2021. AARO linked most of the incidents to balloons, birds and the proliferation of drones cluttering the skies.
 Many pilot accounts of floating orbs were actually reflections of the sun from Starlink satellites, investigators found. They are still examining whether some unexplained events could be foreign technology, such as Chinese aircraft using next-generation cloaking methods that distort their appearance. 

The office found that some seemingly inexplicable events weren’t so strange after all. In one, a 2015 video appeared to show a spherical object buzzing past a jet fighter at an almost impossible speed. “Oh, my gosh dude,” the pilot can be heard saying in the video, laughing. But later, investigators determined there was nothing much to see—whatever the object was, the camera angle and relative speed of the jet had made it appear to be going much faster than it was.
The office’s second mission proved to be more peculiar: to review the historical record going back to 1945 to assess the claims made by dozens of former military employees that Washington operated a secret program to harvest alien technology. Congress granted the office unprecedented access to America’s most highly classified programs to allow Kirkpatrick’s team to run the stories to ground. 
As Kirkpatrick pursued his investigation, he started to uncover a hall of mirrors within the Pentagon, cloaked in official and nonofficial cover. On one level, the secrecy was understandable. The U.S., after all, had been locked in an existential battle with the Soviet Union for decades, each side determined to win the upper hand in the race for ever-more-exotic weapons. 
But Kirkpatrick soon discovered that some of the obsession with secrecy verged on the farcical. A former Air Force officer was visibly terrified when he told Kirkpatrick’s investigators that he had been briefed on a secret alien project decades earlier, and was warned that if he ever repeated the secret he could be jailed or executed. The claim would be repeated to investigators by other men who had never spoken of the matter, even with their spouses. 
It turned out the witnesses had been victims of a bizarre hazing ritual. 
For decades, certain new commanders of the Air Force’s most classified programs, as part of their induction briefings, would be handed a piece of paper with a photo of what looked like a flying saucer. The craft was described as an antigravity maneuvering vehicle. 

The officers were told that the program they were joining, dubbed Yankee Blue, was part of an effort to reverse-engineer the technology on the craft. They were told never to mention it again. Many never learned it was fake. Kirkpatrick found the practice had begun decades before, and appeared to continue still. The defense secretary’s office sent a memo out across the service in the spring of 2023 ordering the practice to stop immediately, but the damage was done. 
Investigators are still trying to determine why officers had misled subordinates, whether as some type of loyalty test, a more deliberate attempt to deceive or something else.  
After that 2023 discovery, Kirkpatrick’s deputy briefed President Joe Biden’s director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, who was stunned.
Could this be the basis for the persistent belief that the U.S. has an alien program that we’ve concealed from the American people? Haines wanted to know, according to people familiar with the matter. How extensive was it? she asked.  
The official responded: “Ma’am, we know it went on for decades. We are talking about hundreds and hundreds of people. These men signed NDAs. They thought it was real.“
The finding could have been devastating to the Air Force. The service was particularly sensitive to the allegations of hazing and asked that AARO hold off on including the finding in the public report, even after Kirkpatrick had briefed lawmakers on the episode. Kirkpatrick retired before that report was finished and released.  
In a statement, a Defense Department spokeswoman acknowledged that AARO had uncovered evidence of fake classified program materials relating to extraterrestrials, and had briefed lawmakers and intelligence officials. The spokeswoman, Sue Gough, said the department didn’t include that information in its report last year because the investigation wasn’t completed, but expects to provide it in another report scheduled for later this year.
“The department is committed to releasing a second volume of its Historical Record Report, to include AARO’s findings on reports of potential pranks and inauthentic materials,” Gough said.  

Kirkpatrick investigated another mystery that stretched back 60 years. 
In 1967, Robert Salas, now 84, was an Air Force captain sitting in a walk-in closet-sized bunker, manning the controls of 10 nuclear missiles in Montana. 
He was prepared to launch apocalyptic strikes should Soviet Russia ever attack first, and got a call around 8 p.m. one night from the guard station above. A glowing reddish-orange oval was hovering over the front gate, Salas told Kirkpatrick’s investigators. The guards had their rifles drawn, pointed at the oval object appearing to float above the gate. A horn sounded in the bunker, signaling a problem with the control system: All 10 missiles were disabled. 
Salas soon learned a similar event occurred at other silos nearby. Were they under attack? Salas never got an answer. The next morning a helicopter was waiting to take Salas back to base. Once there he was ordered: Never discuss the incident. 

Salas was one of five men interviewed by Kirkpatrick’s team who witnessed such events in the 1960s and ’70s. While sworn to secrecy, the men began sharing their stories in the ’90s in books and documentaries. 
Kirkpatrick’s team dug into the story and discovered a terrestrial explanation. The barriers of concrete and steel surrounding America’s nuclear missiles were thick enough to give them a chance if hit first by a Soviet strike. But scientists at the time feared the intense storm of electromagnetic waves generated by a nuclear detonation might render the hardware needed to launch a counterstrike unusable.

To test this vulnerability, the Air Force developed an exotic electromagnetic generator that simulated this pulse of disruptive energy without the need to detonate a nuclear weapon.
When activated, this device, placed on a portable platform 60 feet above the facility, would gather power until it glowed, sometimes with a blinding orange light. It would then fire a burst of energy that could resemble lightning.

The electromagnetic pulses snaked down cables connected to the bunker where launch commanders like Salas sat, disrupting the guidance systems, disabling the weapons and haunting the men to this day. 
But any public leak of the tests at the time would have allowed Russia to know that America’s nuclear arsenal could be disabled in a first strike. The witnesses were kept in the dark. 
To this day Salas believes he was party to an intergalactic intervention to stop nuclear war which the government has tried to hide. He is half right. The experience left the octogenarian deeply skeptical of the U.S. military and its ability to tell the truth. “There is a gigantic coverup, not only by the Air Force, but every other federal agency that has cognizance of this subject,” he said in an interview with the Journal. “We were never briefed on the activities that were going on, the Air Force shut us out of any information.”
Concealing the truth from men like Salas and deliberate efforts to target the public with disinformation unleashed within the halls of the Pentagon itself a dangerous force, which would become almost unstoppable as decades passed. The paranoid mythology the U.S. military helped spread now has a hold over a growing number of its own senior officials who count themselves as believers.
The crisis grew to a boil over a piece of metal mailed to a late-night radio host in 1996, which the sender said they had been told was part of a crashed spaceship.

**USA TARIFF???** 

Tariff is still valid, CBP have not updated on anything. Currently anything that is made in China may be subjected to 54% for orders under 800 USD. We are currently shipping anything that is made in China via Canada Post/USPS. It seems to be the best way to either reduced tariff or bypass tariff due to the way USPS has their import system set up. There is always a chance but we cannot confirmed anything. I know that many of our customer orders were not subjected to duties... or at least they have not get the duties invoice yet... 

If you are ordering anything from us that contain products made in China, there will be a warning at checkout to proceed with caution.  

If you are curious about my performance at world brewers cup this year here is [the video](https://youtu.be/BBqXH1Llbic?si=YQp7RvyafY-8ebnX) :P. I did alright. 

Thank you very much for your support!

I was guaranteed I can cross train in different departments to explore other career options. The position I am in Shift supervisor for coffee outlet, its a position I tried to leave 4 years ago, they just offered me more pay and to cross train & since then I now make more than other in various departments that it’s almost not even worth my time. 

Last year, I upset my Director of F&B due to them closing our cafe for two weeks w/o pay (had to use vacation or work a department we knew nothing about) finding out nothing was actually completed and they wasted our time and PTO, my approach lead him being so angry with me that he’s preventing me from jumping to any new opportunities. I crossed train for an F&B manager for a pool bar… director didn’t want to give me the chance and hotel GM hired a friend who was fired within two months — i knew how to run the pool bar and the employees enjoyed having me. Currently the bar is running without a manager and they have no intention on hiring someone for it, letting a J1 intern manage it for like less than $16/hr. An F&B admin assistant came up and again, denied. I feel defeated. 

I’ve always been interested in banquets. banquets is always asking me for on-call shifts (nothing open yet) but I always have to turn them down due to working nights. My manager only puts me at night bc everyone else is refusing to work PM. It’s starting to become absolutely frustrating as it’s hindering yet ANOTHER department. 

I started working for another company, same brand just different investor group, bartending; something my hotel promised to cross train in yet never followed suit. I already make twice the amount I make at my current position and it’s a significantly smaller hotel, Benefits are just about the same except travel benefits are a little more limited. I’m waiting to find out if I need 30 or 40 hours to receive benefits, as of right now I only need 30. I know there was a 90 day probationary period before receiving benefits so I am awaiting that as well. In the meantime since season will be slowing down, I decided to use all my PTO throughout the rest of the year until December. 

I’m thinking of making the jump before the holiday season approaches as it seems like my current company is a dead end. season hiring is in October so I am debating if I should:
A) I stay and try to jump to another department during hiring season
B) leave altogether and focus on new company
C) wait until a company that will actually take me on for banquets; a manager I’ve acquainted with from a resort much upscale than mine has thrown the offer for October, whether it is on-call or FT i have yet to find out. ",1,1749258625.0,askhotels,3,1.0,False
