I'm fine with much cheaper accommodation but not budget like a hostel. I'm looking at $50 to $75 a night ideally but the main thing is to be close to my friends. Coffee and pastries included in the morning would be nice.

This will be my first time visiting Thailand. I'm a single 50s man, not looking to party but I do enjoy a beer or a nice cocktail. I'm looking to get pampering massages but absolutely nothing involving happy endings. Just hoping for somewhere nice with access to the beach or a nice pool area that isn't crazy loud.

I'd really appreciate your suggestions...thanks!",1,1733321395.0,ThailandTourism,0,1.0,False

It was really nice although, after 7 months I was really unwell being the mistress. He had encouraged me looking for a man who could offer me all I need, since he cannot just now.

I had gotten closer to a friend who's into me (Luke). MM knew everything about it, even that Luke had kissed me. MM was annoyed and hurt but would say ""I don't have a right to say anything. You're right to pursue this"" although at times he'd say ""come on, not that guy ! He's from a terrible neighborhood"".

So, during that nice week with MM, we spent a morning and lunch together, made love. Had a short conversation about his W at some point (for legit reasons), and again I was reminded of my Mistress position and I felt really insecure. He had to leave. It was still a lovely day though.

Luke called me right after, inviting me for a coffee that night. I somehow liked Luke and was happy to see him. What happened is , we ended up sleeping together for the first time.

I had not really thought of it being on the SAME DAY as with MM. I told the truth right away to MM, who was ..... Disgusted. Hurt. And for days he called me while super drunk telling me pretty hardcore things: 
""This was DISGUSTING. Thank god I've seen your true face before making a mistake. You have no idea what I was going to announce to you at the end of this week"".

(He was implying he was going to leave his W and that I had messed that up... But I know that's a total lie. MM just lost his driving licence and is about to wear an electronic bracelet for 6 months so it's definitely not the moment to leave his partner (plus, don't think he will ever).)

After a few days he stopped drowning in alcohol, and apologised to me. Looks like he doesn't remember everything he said. But since then he keeps saying it awoke the ugly and mean part in him and that he's truly sorry. That it was absolutely ok for me to pursue something with Luke. Although ""please not like this, not on the same day, come on"". Which I totally understand.


We are on great terms right now MM and I, and I'm leaving the city soon so we agreed to stop our relationship (and that if he's single one day maybe we could meet again).


What I wonder is...
If , hypothetically, MM is single one day ; do you think that ""two men on the same day"" episode might have destroyed any chance of him truly wanting to come to me ?
Do you think I'm disgusting...?

1h6gs4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1h6gs4t/the_polite_coup/,The Polite Coup,"President Yoon Suk Yeol's hands trembled as he arranged the documents on his desk for the seventh time. The motion steadied his nerves – barely. The manila envelope contained photographs: himself accepting white envelopes from a chaebol’s construction executives, each image timestamped and crystal clear. His secretary had arranged them chronologically, bless her eternally professional soul.

A coffee cup sat cooling on his desk, the steam rising in lazy spirals. He hadn't touched it. The headline would break in six hours. Six hours until thirty years of carefully cultivated reputation would—

His fingers found his tie pin, adjusting it microscopically. There was still one option. An unseemly option.

His hand hovered over the phone for three long breaths before he picked it up.

""Secretary Park? Would you join me in my office?"" A pause. ""And please bring contingency protocol K-17.""

Twenty minutes later, Secretary Park stood at attention, clutching a leather portfolio. ""Sir, implementing K-17 would require—""

""I'm aware of the requirements.""

Yoon's voice was steady now. ""Draft the declaration. Martial law. Use the template from the '79 precedent, but..."" he brushed an invisible speck from his sleeve, ""...let's add a note about North Korean collaborators. That should be enough to keep the press happy.""

The secretary's pen scratched against paper. Outside the window, Seoul's lights twinkled, oblivious to the machinery of state grinding into motion.

The 2 AM darkness in Sergeant Hyun-Woo's barracks shattered with his k-pop ringtone. His dreams of his mother's steaming kimchi jjigae evaporated as the duty officer's voice crackled through: ""Parliament deployment. Non-lethal loadout only. Fifteen minutes.""

""Non-lethal?"" Staff Sergeant Kim muttered as they set up barriers ninety minutes later. The pre-dawn air bit through their uniforms. ""Sir, these might as well be water pistols.""

Hyun-Woo ran his thumb along his riot shield's edge, feeling each scratch and dent from previous protests. ""Standard protocol for legislative premises. We maintain order through presence, not force."" The words felt hollow in his mouth, rehearsed from a manual written by men who'd never stood a line.

A news van's headlights swept across them. Then another. And another. Soon the street hummed with media vehicles, their satellite dishes rising like metal mushrooms in the gray morning light. Cameras began to flash. Protesters began arriving.

""Sir?"" Private Lee shifted his weight. ""The martial law orders say no press or protests allowed.""

Hyun-Woo watched another van park. ""I see them, Private.""

""Should we...""

""I see them,"" he repeated, softer this time. The shield felt heavier with each passing minute.

Parliament Member Ji-Hye emerged from the crowd like a splash of iridescent watercolor in her pearl-gray hanbok. Camera flashes intensified, but she moved as if walking through her own garden, unhurried. Each step measured, deliberate.

She stopped three paces from Hyun-Woo's shield. ""Sergeant."" Her voice carried just far enough to be caught by the nearest microphones. ""These halls belong to the people's representatives. I would kindly request access""

Hyun-Woo felt sweat trickle down his back despite the morning chill. ""The building is sealed under emergency orders, Member Ji-Hye.""

""Ah."" She nodded, as if he'd made a particularly interesting point during a tea ceremony. Her eyes flicked to his nameplate, then his riot shield, then the practice weapon at his side.

Without another word, she turned and walked exactly twenty paces left. The crowd parted. At a ground-floor window, already open, several citizens had formed an impromptu assistance line. They lifted her up, in through the window. Ji-Hye paused at the window's edge, looked back at the soldiers, and gave a slight bow before accepting the protesters' help inside.

""Orders, sir?"" Staff Sergeant Kim's knuckles were white on his weapon.

Hyun-Woo watched as more parliament members appeared, each following Ji-Hye's path. Some wore business suits, others traditional dress. All bowed before entering. Through the windows, he could see them removing their shoes, could hear the echo of the speaker's gavel as they called the emergency session to order.

""We follow protocol,"" he said finally. ""No force against legislators. No exceptions.""

Forty-seven minutes later, Ji-Hye reappeared at the window. She held a document embossed with the parliament's seal, the ink still fresh. ""The emergency session has concluded, Sergeant. Martial law has been lifted by unanimous vote. 190-0."" She extended the paper. ""Your copy, for proper documentation and recordkeeping.""

Hyun-Woo stared at the document, then at his shield, then at the crowd of citizens and journalists watching in complete silence.

He set down his shield and began to walk home.

President Yoon's coffee had gone completely cold when his aide entered without knocking. One look at the aide's face told him everything.

""They had quorum?"" His voice was barely a whisper.

""Yes, sir. Full attendance. Your party boycotted, but it wasn’t enough. All votes were recorded and notarized.""

Yoon touched his tie pin one last time. Outside his window, the sun had fully risen over Seoul. Even now, he could hear the whir of printer presses running the morning editions. He wondered what they’d say, how they’d frame it.

He reached for the phone to make his final presidential announcement, officially ending the martial law order.

But he paused.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

I didn't know how to get the ice cream from the fridge, so I tried to shit my way in by doing something awful. I instantly regretted it but oh well, it is what it is. So, instead of the ice cream, I decided to get a cup of coffee instead. This way I'll burn my mouth awake instead of freezing it. Then, after the cup, I decided to study a bit about nuclear physics, and wondered if I could use any of the stuff I learned to get the ice cream out of the fridge. However, I didn't realize that I didn't actually have any nuclear plants in my house. But I do have regular plants, so I painted them bright green so they would emit a kind of nuclear lighting type light and they look radioactive how. That will do. I then rammed the plants into the fridge, hoping something real good and useful would happen. But, well I just got paint smeared all over the front of my fridge, and still no ice cream. Welp. Then, I remembered that I did burn my toaster the other day. I think that may help. If the fridge is icy then perhaps making it less icy would help? I don't know but I could try. So I tried to smear my toaster against the wall of my ice-coated fridge, but all that happened is my toasted rubbing against the green paint and short circuiting. I didn't get any ice cream but I did get electrically shocked. I guess that's a good substitute for a brain freeze. However, I do have a problem and that is that I still got to finish my nuclear physics homework. So I started working on that but the coffee worn off (my mouth wasn't burning anymore) so I fell asleep instead, and got the weirdest dreams ever.

\- - -

That was the quote that lingered in my mind. I saw it once—on a TV screen during a mental health awareness ad, which played after the show I was absentmindedly watching had ended. It stayed with me, I pondered how powerful our minds can shape our reality. The thoughts we think, beliefs we share, and our perceptions of reality aren't merely passive but actively influence how we experience and interact daily.

It had me thinking, that despite everyone living in the same physical world, billions of individual realities, cultivated by billions of other people co-exist under one shared present, does that make sense?

But what do I know? I was just a college student trying to figure things out, I still am. Truth be told, I wasn't even sure I was in the right course, so I'm fairly certain that no one should be taking my thoughts seriously about existential views regarding mankind.

Brushing off my odd late-night philosophicals, my head shifted to more important and delicious concerns—what to eat for dinner. I thought about ordering Chinese food but quickly disregarded it, due to the need to save money for my car payment, which I've been paying off since last year.

So, I settled for the next best thing—ramen noodles.

They weren't so bad—actually, not bad at all. It hit the spot for me. It might not be everyone's ideal hearty meal, but it was good enough for me.

Shortly after, I then washed the dishes, something I had done countless times—whether in the afternoon or, more often, at night. Though, the time of day didn't matter, as in front of the sink, there was this window. It wasn't an ordinary window used for admiring the view or scenery outside; its sole purpose was to expel fumes from the kitchen when someone cooked.

It stretched the full length of the sink to the drain board, with a built-in exhaust fan just above the handle. You could open the window slightly, but it wouldn't slide all the way down; it could only open halfway before being held back by the hinge.

When I peered out, all I could see was darkness—pitch black, apart from my darkened reflection. You wouldn't even know there was an identical window on the opposite side if it weren't for the rare moments when workers opened the ventilation during the day, letting in just enough light to reveal the various windows lining the vertical space from top to bottom. To me, It looked more like an empty elevator shaft than anything else, but except for elevator doors it had windows.

Well, I guess I am partially to blame in choosing where to live in the building, when I did a quick tour of the vacant spaces, I chose the one with an ominous window, instead of an apartment with a kitchen that didn't face a black void. Sure, I could've splurged for a better space with a scenic view, or a better building in general, but that was out of the question. I was on a tight budget, and a good view wasn't exactly a priority standard at that time.

That night, when it came time for me to wind down and get ready for bed I saw from my living room window that it was pouring rain outside, that explained the pitter-pattering I kept hearing as I had dinner, but paid no mind to. I watched the street, empty and desolate in the dead of night as the heavy rain poured on the pavement and the lifeless road, how the droplets of rain flowed with the direction of the strong winds blowing through the air, the trees swaying it's leaves and branches along the gushing winds, it was then made clear to me it wasn't just a heavy rainy night, outside before me was a storm in place.

I felt taken aback by the sudden alarm that emitted from my phone, the sounds of panicked sirens repeatedly ringing from inside the phone's speaker, as the phone's LED light illuminated my dimly-lit features, my brows furrowed as I read;

. . .

*9:32 PM*

'Emergency Alert'

**National Weather Service:** A STORM SURGE WARNING is in effect for Richmond, VA until 4:00 AM. Take action now to protect life and property. Avoid flood-prone areas.

. . .

I looked out the window once more at the empty, desolate streets, saturated by the storm's relentless rain. The rainwater cascaded down the street, flowing over the pavement in sheets. It was obvious that the storm wasn't going to let up anytime soon. As I lay in bed, the steady rhythm of the rain took on a surprisingly therapeutic quality, offering a strange sense of calm amidst the storm's fury.

I felt truly at peace for a moment. The rain's pitter-patter had grown louder compared to earlier, when I barely noticed it. With my head nestled snugly on the pillow, I tried to surrender to sleep, letting the gentle rhythm of the rain lull me into a deep, restorative slumber, enjoying one of the best rests I had in quite some time.

Later that week, as early December settled in, my air-conditioning started to leak, well it had began leaking the morning after the storm, thus I had to keep a bucket underneath, and upon testing it's functions I came to a realization that it had broke during the night. Fortunately, winter made the lack of cooling less of an issue, though the building manager had ghosted my text.

At some point black spots began to grow on the grills, dark, jagged blotches creeping across the metal, resembling ink bleeding through paper, though I tried cleaning, but it smudged and made more of a nuisance for myself to get rid of as it turned the white paint surrounding it dirtier.

The unit I rented out wasn't designed to expel heat like some of the others, so I had no problems with a heater, unlike other tenants. However, one problem did remain: the leak. While it wasn't as bad as when the storm first hit, it just persisted. I spoke to the maintenance guy, hoping that bringing it up might speed up the process, but all he told me was that there were delays in repairs. Apparently, I wasn't the only one dealing with water leakage—whilst other units were reporting problems with their heating system.

Despite the issues with my apartment not functioning properly, I found myself brushing off those minor inconveniences. Something else had been bothering me entirely. Over the past few days, I've felt increasingly unsettled in my own space, for the past few days I began to experience the same day to day occurrences I used to get, when I lived with my own family—extra dishes to clean that I don't recall using, dirt and smudges on the floor I'm certain I didn't cause, missing food items from the fridge that I was sure I had just bought.

These little signs that made me feel as if somebody else lived with me was subtle at first, I even began to think I was just starting to forget easily, early dementia, maybe? No that would've been easier to deal with.

What unnerved me the most in the days since the storm were the footsteps I started hearing at night outside my bedroom door. Normally, it was quiet, and I'd curl up with a book in the dim, cozy light of my room, or maybe scroll through messages from friends and family. But now, I found myself huddled under the covers, eyes fixed on the thin strip of light beneath the door, where a quick shadow occasionally passed, accompanied by the wet tap of bare feet on the cold floor, resembling water droplets hastily falling onto a half-full bucket.

Growing up, I wasn't one to easily believe in ghost stories, but I wasn't a full-blown skeptic either. When faced with something I can't explain, I'm not so dense as to just ignore it and brush it off as unscientific. That part of me is what made it so hard to leave my room at night. It felt ridiculous—here I was, a grown man who'd been living alone for almost two years, struggling to muster the courage to go to the bathroom because I believed there was a ghosts in my apartment, how pathetic.

The prospect of moving out was bleak, so whether I was being haunted or not, I couldn't let whatever this was deter me from living normally. Thus, I found my hand gripping on the handle as I unlocked the door, letting the light from the hallway slowly fill up my darkened room; of course I saw nothing, I simply let out sigh of relief and made my way towards the bathroom near my living room. What did I expect upon opening that door? did I expect a dead ghost from a past century to jump me before I could take a leak?

Walking down the hallway, my gaze was mainly fixed on to the floor, while the warm glow from the lights above washed over the space; it being the only source of light in the entire apartment. Just as my hand hovered over the bathroom light switch, my fingertips grazing the cold plastic, I had paused right then and there.

My gaze shifted beyond the kitchen, and towards the window. A light—no, not from inside my apartment, but outside the kitchen window, directly opposite from my own. It shone like a rectangular beacon in the darkness, catching my eye even from where I stood in the hallway, far removed from its source.

Taken aback, I shook myself from the brief trance as I had stepped into the bathroom. Even when I tried to rationalize what had occurred, my mind kept circling back to that light. What could it have been? As far as I knew, no one lived in the apartment next to mine. It wasn't even possible someone had moved in recently without me noticing, as I would've heard the commotion, so the only option left could be, maybe Mr. Grant was fixing the place up?... at two in the morning. Still, whatever it was, it didn't seem to matter anymore.

Exiting the bathroom, I realized that the light was gone. My kitchen was once again cloaked in darkness, illuminated only by the faint glow from the only light source from the hall. However, just as I walked back to my room, I could've sworn I saw something—a movement in my periphery, the shifts in the shadows, darting behind one furniture to another.

For the past few days, I'd felt increasingly unnerved. Coming home from classes, I would sometimes overhear my neighbors talking about their issues with the building. I wasn't particularly fond of taking the elevator with others—it always felt awkward—but it was one of those unavoidable aspects of apartment living.

One afternoon, I found myself sharing the elevator with Mrs. Callahan and a friend she'd brought over, and they were chatting about work. I wasn't one to eavesdrop, but when people are only three or four feet away enclosed in a metallic box with you, it's hard not to catch bits of their conversation.

With my phone out, pretending to be disinterested, I couldn't help but overhear Mrs. Callahan discussing the issues she'd been having with her apartment. She mentioned a gas leak she experienced last week—luckily, it was fixed, but the thought alone was unsettling. I'd heard of a fire in this very building years ago, also caused by a gas leak. It had been ruled an accident, but still, tragedy can linger in people's minds, longer than they hope it would.

I never learned many of the details, not even where in the building it had happened, but I reassured myself that maintenance now was different from before—hoping, for the better.

As I stepped out of the elevator and made my way to my apartment, I noticed Mr. Jobert down the hall, on the opposite side from where I lived. He was a retired veteran from the military, a Coast Guard, as I recall. He was older, with salt-and-pepper hair and a gruff exterior that spoke of age, yet his solid build hinted at strength that could still take on someone younger. Despite the years , he looked like he could outmatch a high school football player if it came to it. Mr. Jobert was the only neighbor I regularly spoke with on this floor.

On my first day, he'd helped me move furniture into my apartment, most likely out of pity when he saw me struggling to get a couch through the doorway. Occasionally, I'd catch a glimpse of his daughter, Cindy. She looked about my age, though I was pretty sure she didn't attend the same university as me—given that I've yet to seen her around campus.

I greeted Mr. Jobert with a quick nod, and he responded with a curt smile as I headed toward my apartment door. My gaze drifted to my unit, and suddenly the door beside mine came into view, triggering memories of last night. The light from the kitchen window flashed back in my mind. As far as I knew, no one lived in the apartment next to mine, that thought replayed in my head like a broken record since last night. With my key poised to turn in the lock, I hesitated, then turned away, striding down the hallway to the other end.

*""Hey, Mr. Jobert, sorry to bother. Are you busy?""* I asked, my keys finding it's way back to my pocket.

*""Hey, Josh. No, not at all, just waiting on a delivery,""* he shrugged, tapping away on his phone, one hand holding it upright while the other did heavily tapped on the screen. Something I noticed older people did more often than those younger.

*""I was wondering if I could ask you something.""*

He hummed in acknowledgment, still focused on his device.

*""Do you happen to know if anyone's living in the apartment next to mine?""*

*""506?""* He finally glanced up from his phone, his brow furrowed in a perplexed expression as I nodded.

*""No, son, no one's lived there in years. But, you should know that, right?""*

I scratched my brow, unsure how to explain last night's strange occurrence without sounding like I'd lost it, the thought of talking about these occurrences going on in my apartment to anyone was silly, thinking of me rambling about footsteps, random blotches of dirt and murmured whispers sounded stupid to me, it just made me sound as if I was crazy.

*""Well... last night, when I got up, I saw light coming from my kitchen window. It looked like it was coming from the window in front of mine... from Apartment 506.""*

He stopped tapping on his phone, furrowing his brow further. His expression shifted from confusion to deep thought. As I looked up at him from a shorter angle, I catching a glimpse of the scar on his neck, standing out under the hallway light.

. . .

I remembered the time I'd asked him about that scar, he had me babysit his dog 'Lady' while he was from home for a few days, when he came to pick her up I invited him for coffee, and we had small talk while his white fluff ball of a dog ran around. He wore the same thoughtful expression when I asked, clearly weighing what to say, likely recalling the events that led to him getting the scar. After a moment, once he had gathered his thoughts, he shared a story from his time at sea in the late eighties when he served as a Coast Guard officer.

He talked about his duties back then, the long nights on watch, the unpredictable nature of life at sea, what lurked within the unknown, the unexplored, where nature had made the decision that no man was destined to see. With a slight pause, he finally spoke the day he got his scar. A commercial fishing boat had radioed in for help to the Coast Guard ship he was stationed it at the time.

He and his crew, along with his partner Murphy—who he always referred to by last name—were dispatched to check it out. When their ship neared the boat in distress, he and Murphy deployed into the water to investigate. But something was off. Despite being within close proximity to the boat, they heard no response from the crew, the moment they arrived for help.

Murphy hopped on the boat first, calling out for the fishermen to show themselves. When they got on the vessel was eerily silent, no signs of life anywhere, not even a single sound, say for the haunting winds accompanied by the rain, with the sway of the sea, just no short of distance below them.

With all the lights extinguished, the ship had looked as if abandoned, Murphy joked that maybe a ghost had radioed in, Mr. Jobert didn't really find that funny as he smacked his partner at the back of the head, before the pair proceeded, solely relying on their tactical flashlights. While Murphy entered the wheelhouse, Mr. Jobert stayed by the deck, sweeping his light over the area as they both covered ground.

A full minute hadn't even gone by before a curdling scream pierced through the raining ambience. The scream came from inside the wheelhouse, muffled as the scream was barely contained inside the small shed. Mr. Jobert's heart raced as he rushed to check on his partner. He needed not to check inside the wheel house as the door opened on it's own, with Murphy's body had collapsed against it, causing it to come wide open. Mr. Jobert's flashlight beam fell on his partner's form, and what he saw made his stomach drop.

Murphy's chest was filleted open, the bones from his chest ripped out as flesh and blood protruding from deep, claw-like gashes. His face was frozen in an expression of horror, his eyes wide and unblinking as they locked onto Mr. Jobert's. With a trembling hand, Murphy clutched his bleeding throat in an effort to stop the bleeding spilling from his open throat, choking on his own blood. His eyes seemed to scream a silent warning, pleading for Mr. Jobert to run, yet no words escaped his lips—only a sickening gurgle before life drained from his body.

Mr. Jobert frozen, standing in nothing but the shock of his partner's death gripping him, in his eyes at that moment, everything unfolded in a blur. The man he's spent countless of hours to years with as friends and companions was dead right in front of his eyes. Murphy promised him he'd be there for his wedding, he'd be there to see him and Lanie get married.

He was barely holding himself together, let alone fully in comprehension of his situation, when in an instant his flashlight illuminated the open door, something lunged at him with a speed void of any humanlike attributes. He barely got a good look at whoever or whatever it was, before the force had knocked him off balance, causing him to tumble backward at the railing of the ship, his flashlight slipping from his grasp and clattering uselessly as he fell over the side of the boat, plunging into the cold open sea.

Disoriented, he struggled to make sense of what had just happened. He began to realize he was under water as his lungs burned for air, while he instinctively kicked towards the surface, but then a chilling realization hit him—whatever had attacked him, had fallen into the water too.

Fighting against panic, he swam desperately to break through to the surface. The storm above raged violently, with rain and crashing waves making it near impossible to see. His only thought was to get back onto the smaller boat, to escape and reach the safety of the Coast Guard ship. But just as his fingers barely grazed the surface, a cold, scaly grip clamped onto his ankle, the hard piercing scales scratched onto his skin.

In an instant, he was yanked back down into the depths.

Mr. Jobert fought desperately, thrashing against the force pulling him deeper into the dark abyss. With his vision rendered a blur by the water and the panic rising from his chest, he twisted himself around, getting a good look at what had attacked him and his partner—the creature responsible for Murphy's death. Through the red haze of anger and rage he felt in that moment, crippling fear had latched itself onto him as he bared a sight he would never forget, its terrifying form etched itself into his mind, haunting him to this day.

It wasn't human, hell it wasn't even an animal, what Mr. Jobert saw that faithful night was an unearthly aquatic humanoid. Its body was covered in slick, glistening scales, and its limbs were webbed like a grotesque merging of man and sea. Fins protruded from its spine starting from the back of it's head down to it's tailbone, what locked onto Mr. Jobert was its glowing red eyes bore fully of carnal rage and hunger with an otherworldly intensity.

The creature was either completely feral, or pure evil. Its gaze cutting through the water, locking onto him. After a moment of thrashing in silence, the creature let out a deafening cry—a sound unlike anything he'd ever heard throughout what his time at sea. It started as a deep, haunting whale-like call that had morphed into a glass shattering shriek that rattled his skull, if it weren't for the fact that they were underwater, the piercing echo would've ruptured his eardrums.

Mr. Jobert seen what that thing had done to Murphy, he wasn't going to allow it to do the same thing to him next, for his survival, for his fiance, and for his partner Murphy. He was going to survive, even with nothing but the skin of his teeth, and the fire under his ass. Summoning the strength he could gather, Mr. Jobert lifted his free ankle and used his hard boot to kick the creature square in the face, feeling the satisfying crunch boot against its tough, scaled skin.

The grip on his ankle loosened as it's claws started to spread apart from the tight hold, he wasted no time, kicking himself free once more. His lungs burned for air as he swam to get to the surface, until he caught sight of the dark silhouette of the small boat nearby—the small rescue boat he and Murphy used to reach the ill-fated fishing vessel.

Driven by pure survival instinct, he surged upwards, the muffled rain louder as he approached the surface closer. With his heart pounding in his chest and his lungs feeling as if it was going to burst inside his chest, Mr. Jobert aimed for the surface, kicking with all his might.

With the sliver of hope wrapped around him, he felt a sharp grip coil around his shoulders—rough, scaly arms digging into his skin as the creature latched onto him to pull him back down deeper into the depths of the sea. Its cold body pressing against his back, dragging him down like a relentless predator. Panic surged through him, and his muffled scream was lost in the bubbles of water as he nudged and elbowed, struggling to unlatch the thing attaching itself onto him.

In abject fury, Mr. Jobert felt as if he was close to his wits end, feeling his resolve slowly deplete, his fists pounding against the creature's grasp as it clung to him like a drowning parasite, desperate for its host. Its claws latched onto his neck, drawing minimal blood from the piercing grip. This thing was relentless, but Mr. Jobert wasn't going down, not without a fight.

Desperate, from his thrashing and wiggling free from it's grasp, he had managed to have enough space to turn his body around, the moment they faced each other, he plunged his thumbs into the creature's eye sockets. His fingers pierced into the creature's presumed weak spot, feeling the cold wet tissues wrapping around his harsh thumbs, whilst deep in it's sockets, with his nails pressed against the corneas.

The monster let out a blood-curdling shriek, so piercing it reverberated through the water. Dark blood clouded the surrounding waters around them, turning the sea into a murky red haze. In its pain, the creature retaliated, despite it's blocked vision, it was still able to do some damage, slashing at the side of Mr. Jobert's neck with its claws, ripping the tender flesh, luckily not enough to sever an artery. The attack sent a sharp sting of pain through him. He let out a pained cry, out of agony but didn't stop—he couldn't afford to.

Pulling back his thumbs free, he gave one last kick, channeling all his strength to condemning the creature back to the hell it crawled out of, he used to momentum of the kick to propel himself further up the surface. The cut on his neck throbbing and leaking blood but, still he managed to power through with pure adrenaline. The surface was near, but he dared not look back, focusing on every stroke and kick, driven by sheer power and the will to live.

Mr. Jobert safely returned to the coast guard ship, though he was bloodied and shaken, the slash on his neck was a glaring reminder of the near death experience he'd just survived. His fellow officers swarmed him with questions, what happened to the boat? where was Murphy? Hesitant he'd sound absolutely nuts, he still told his truth. As unbelievable as it sounded, he detailed everything, down to the gash on his neck. He was sure they'd think he was crazy, and that no one would buy the story of an aquatic creature attacking them in the dead of night. But that didn't matter—he knew what he saw, what he encountered, and even if hell decided to open up underneath, he will continue to stand by his account.

A team of coast guard officers later went back to the fishing vessel to investigate, only to find the obvious, nothing. No Murphy. No traces of the creature or it's existence, and certainly not a single fisherman that supposedly radioed them in. The only blaring evidence of something gone horribly wrong in the boat was the trail of blood that led from the wheelhouse and vanished into the dark water. Of course, when they returned to shore, an official investigation with law enforcement involved was launched. But it led nowhere, as there were no solid leads, no body to recover, no witnesses beyond Mr. Jobert, who's presumed to be a nut job, though medical and psychological tests proves otherwise, they have no evidence to corroborate his terrifying account.

Murphy was officially listed as ""missing, presumed dead,"" and despite his death, no one could link it to Mr. Jobert or to anything natural. The story was filed away as an unsolved mystery. But even if the rest of the world had to move on, Mr. Jobert never did. He believed—no, *he knew*—what had happened that night. Whether anyone believed him or not didn't matter. That was his truth. And every time he glanced at the scar on his neck, he was reminded of the horror beneath the waves that had claimed his friend and nearly taken his life too.

. . .

*""That does sound strange... Look, it may be unlikely, but it could've also been Grant. Seems far-fetched he'd be doing checks or repairs at that hour, but still.""*

Mr. Jobert's voice cut through the haze in my mind, forcing me to shake off the thoughts that had been swirling around. I tried to focus on what he was telling me.

*""I thought the same,""* I admitted. *""Mr. Grant's been pretty tied up lately with all the repairs around the building. He hasn't even gotten around to fixing my A/C.""*

Mr. Jobert nodded knowingly. *""Yeah, slow repairs aren't exactly uncommon here. You've been here long enough to know. Even if they're swamped with work, they're always slow to respond.""*

I found myself agreeing, thinking over his words, but before I could form a proper response, the elevator behind us dinged. A man in a delivery uniform stepped out, briefly scanning the hallway until his eyes landed on us. He jogged over, pizza box in hand, confirming the order with Mr. Jobert, as I stepped aside letting them handle the exchange.

*""Hey, kid,""* Mr. Jobert said after paying for the pizza, *""fancy coming in for a slice? I decided to just order in for supper. Cindy said she couldn't make it today, busy with whatever school stuff she's got going on.""*

*""Sure.""* I nodded with a chuckled grin.

I wouldn't turn down free pizza, even if someone held a gun to my head. When the delivery guy left through the building elevator, I followed Mr. Jobert inside his apartment. It felt cozy, distinct and as homey as I remembered it would be since the last time I've been. I didn't feel the strange unease that had plagued over me in my own place lately. Here, I could relax and breathe easily, even if it was only for a little while.

Days had passed since my talk with Mr. Jobert, still no sign of Mr. Grant. He didn't come to my apartment to check on anything, none of the complaints I had seemed to have even reached him as I was left on delivered. I really wasn't a stickler to get these issues resolved quickly, if it wasn't for the mold on my A/C that had worsened to the point of it being unbearable to be around. It was spreading out, thick and dark clumps of mold attached itself to the ventilation grills, and the smell... It resembled something rotting, putrid enough to turn my stomach. Eating in the living room had become impossible. I spent most of my time holed up in my room just to escape the stench.

What really pushed me over the edge was when one morning I woke, I found drops of liquid leaking from the vents again, when I heard the familiar sound of liquid tapping on the floor. Only this time, it wasn't water. The blackened mold had begun seeping out between the grills in ink-like streaks, as if an octopus erupted from inside the ventilation system. Since I've been asleep when the leaking had begun, I wasn't able to catch it in time before it made an even bigger mess to clean up. This was a nightmare—scrubbing and mopping for what felt like hours as my arms started to feel restless, doing whatever it could just to get rid of the foul-smelling mess.

Frustrated, and feeling like I'd reached my limit, I finally picked up the phone and called the maintenance guy.

He didn't pick up, and with two hours left before class, I had enough time to pester him until he answered. Frustrated, I spammed his phone with missed calls, feeling like an obsessive ex, when finally, just as I was rifling through the fridge for something to pack for lunch, a crackling sound echoed from my phone's speakers. My attention snapped back to it, sitting on the counter, and I rushed over to pick it up.

*""What?""*

His voice was groggy, and I could tell he'd just woken up, which only irritated me more. The nerve—like I was the one being a bother, as if I committed a the great sin of coming to him about the repairs he should've done two weeks ago.

*""Mr. Grant, I texted you weeks ago about my A/C. It's molding at this point! I've had to clean up this disgusting mess—""*

*""Ah, shit. I'm sorry, kid,""* he interrupted, sounding more exhausted than anything. ""Yeah, I got your texts... and all the other complaints from everyone else in the building. I haven't gotten to your problem yet because it's not as urgent as some of the other crap I'm dealing with.""

His voice grew more aggravated, as if he was recalling everything at once.

*""Yesterday, that fat bitch Bertha from 304 had people raising alarms because her apartment started smelling like a goddamn corpse. I had to call 911, and we busted down her door thinking she'd dropped dead from a heart attack. Turns out she's been hoarding dead cats, and the smell was seeping through the walls. So, excuse me if I haven't gotten around to your A/C since the beginning of the month.""*

I couldn't really mutter up much of a response, he could tell I was taken aback by his ranting as he sighed, seemingly out of pity for leaving me speechless at the other line.

*""Okay... how about this,"" he offered, sounding a little less annoyed, ""I'll come check it out next week on Monday. Can you stick it out until then?""*

*""Yes, please,""* I muttered.

*""Great.""* He hung up.

Sighing, I just shrugged it off, returning to what I'd been doing at that time, before the call interrupted me. My college classes that day was as mundane as ever, with the usual routine dragging on, although it was a bit more stressful, as holidays were approaching, deadlines had to be met. With another semester being nearly over—only a more week until the sweet temporarily release from school, due to the winter break. I could practically feel the collective excitement around the campus—students, staff, and even professors were looking forward to the break for a chance to head home to their families for the holidays.

Though, it was still Thursday after all, and I had a few more classes to power through before the Monday break finally arrived, so I couldn't feel too comfortable just yet.

I was burning the midnight oil, working on papers that were due the next day, when the familiar pang of hunger hit. Leaning back in my chair, I let out a sigh and glanced at the monitor. My eyes skimmed the pages of the essay I'd been hammering out for hours. The bulk of it was done, thankfully, but it still needed a final round of revisions and a few touch-ups before I could submit it to my professor.

My eyes drifted to the bottom right corner of the screen: 11:44. Sixteen minutes before the deadline. I quickly double-checked for any glaring errors—grammar, spelling, all the usual pitfalls that professors would chew you on for, if overseen. Satisfied that it was as polished as it was going to get, I let out a deep sigh. It was time. I drafted an email, attached the file, and hit ""Send."" The weight of that assignment was finally lifted off my shoulders, as I felt a sigh of relief come out of me.

The calming pitter-patter of rain against my bedroom window had lulled me into a rare state of peace. With my essay finally behind me, I leaned back into my chair, letting the white noise wash over me. For the first time in a while, my mind felt clear—until a sudden, muffled crash jolted me alert. The distinct clatter of ceramic hitting the floor sent a jolt of unease through me. My eyes shot to the bedroom door, dimly lit by the glow of my desk lamp.

Slowly, I stood, my heart picking up speed as I moved toward the noise.

The creak of my door echoed softly as I stepped out into the hallway, the warm light barely guiding my steps. I made my way to the kitchen, each footfall muted by the quiet of the apartment. My fingertips brushed against the cold plastic of the switch before I flicked it on, and the harsh kitchen light buzzed to life, casting long shadows across the floor.

There I found before me pieces of a plate I had used previously earlier in the day, what was once a formed ceramic piece was now reduced to jagged pieces of shattered glass onto the floor. With my brows furrowed I began to clean, I assumed it had slipped somehow from the counter. I had just washed these letting them out to dry on the drain board before I could put it back on the cabinet above the counter, where I stored my other plates.

Sweeping the shards into a neat pile, my eyes drifted to the counter where the plate would have been. Something about it felt off. The surface was smeared with grime—dust and debris mingled with smudges of what looked to be mud. But what stopped me cold was a medium-sized mark, unmistakably resembling a footprint. I froze, staring at it for a moment longer than necessary. After discarding the broken pieces, I turned my attention to scrubbing the dirt from the counter, the unsettling image of that footprint lingering at the back of my mind.

Quite frankly, I would've been more freaked out, if this wasn't the first time I'd come across something like this. Just the week before, after coming home late from a dinner with some groupmates after class, I'd noticed dirt trailing from the front door to the living room. At the time, I shrugged it off, assuming it was my own doing, maybe from rushing in and out? But now, with the footprint shaped mark on a counter, I was sure I hadn't caused, it boggled my mind.

I knew for certain that this time it wasn't me. And I had no idea what to make of it.

On my way back to my room, no longer feeling the need to eat, that eerie sensation returned—the same one I had felt the night I hesitantly stepped out of my bedroom, the same night the kitchen window had glared with the unnatural light from the mirroring window next door. Only this time, there was nothing. No light, no unexplained footsteps that I tried to pass off as dripping water. Just silence.

I stood frozen for what felt like five long minutes, staring into the dim, hollow space of my living room. The shadows twisted unnervingly, and the outlines of my furniture felt uncanny, as if the empty leather seats were watching me, accusing me of being an intruder in my own home. A chill gripped me, creeping up my spine, as I saw it, a dark hand emerging from behind the couch, gripping the seat to help itself up further, slowly rising as the smell of rotting emitted from the ventilation above became more prominent.

My chest tightened, and before I knew it, my eyes stung with tears I hadn't realized were forming.

The tension snapped, and I bolted to my room, slamming the door behind me, causing the crucifix attached above the doorway to shake, as I flicked the lock with shaking hands. With my back pressed against the door, sinking myself to the floor, the gentle, warm glow from my desk lamp was my only comfort, casting a soft light in the room that barely reached the corners.

I sat with my knees pulled to my chest, hugging myself tightly like a child seeking shelter.

My forehead rested against my knees, and for a brief moment, I let my body curl in on itself, trying to find peace in that fetal position, hoping to feel safe again. With stray tears trickling slowly down the skin of my cheek, I heard the faint sound of a music box, its soft, lilting notes permeated my ears, hearing the source coming from under the slit of the door, slowly lulling me to sleep.

It doesn't make any sense!

Disclaimer: that's not a rant. Not everything has to make sense to be good.

**Drawing a contract for a fake relationship:**

It's so much fun, but let's think this over: a contract without witnesses, written by themselves in a coffee shop, featuring only a mere signature as a proof of veracity and unregistered — because if they were to register the contract, then someone else in the government would know about the nature of their relationship.

If all that isn't a problem. Yet, in the end of the contract if one of the parties simply refuse to give in, who will you talk to to make this contract valid? You can't!

**Breaking your engagement or attempting to before the arrival of the ogFL:**

So, this is a political engagement to which the ML agreed upon and, according to story, will only give up because he met the love of his life, but our desperate lead goes there and asks to break up before his ""reason"" even arrives. Ofc he won't agree, girl!

**Disrespectful maids:**

It doesn't matter how shitty your situation is. There ain't no way a commoner could abuse a noble without facing consequences. Technically, the lady could beat the shit out of the maid and nothing would happen to her, while the other way around could be even considered treason!

Wow, didn't know I missed it that much. Also, how weird is life that I'm now *that* person; the one who says he loves going to the gym and misses when he doesn't! As weird to me as me suggesting sugar snaps are a nicer snack than chips (spoiler alert: *no*. Just no.)

...*<sits down with you for breakfast...is silent a bit>*...

What you want to do, as a parent, is to take away all pain, all hardship, from your kid. Who wouldn't? Who would wish that kind of thing on someone?

And yeah, I know you know as well that nobody can do that for someone else. Nobody is getting out of this thing alive, and nobody is getting out of it unharmed.

And so...no, I can't take away your hurt nor carry it for you.

Best I can do is talk about how it is for me. That can be useful -- but it's not the same as experiencing it. ...*<thinks>*... Like, I can tell you how it is to go to a gym for the first time, how my body felt lifting weights for the first time. How it took time for me to really notice and feel which muscles are engaged, which muscles to focus on during a movement. But only doing it yourself will give you those same experiences.

Anyway.....

Sadness, emotional pain, anguish, sorrow, regret, grief -- these are part of human life like breathing is. Experiencing these feelings at any time doesn't mean you're broken. It means you're whole, experiencing the whole of life. Now, like most sane people, you won't enjoy these feelings. It's much nicer to pass a day on a happy-high than it is in the depths of despair, right? .... Right.

And so, maybe we will want to avoid those feelings, those emotions. Push them aside, push them away, drink them away, anything to make them just not be. Thing is, kid.... These feelings need to do their feelings. Feelings (noun) need to feel (verb). They need to be *heard*, in a way. ...*<thinks what to compare it with>*... If you come to me in deep hurt, you cry, you howl from the pain inside of you, then of course I don't *want* that. I don't want you to feel like that. But would me pushing you away make you feel better? Would it feel nice if I tell you, ""buckle up! straighten up! stop that crap!""? No, right? ...*<nods>*... Your feelings are like your kids, or like your best friend. They come to you to be *heard*. And that might suck (ha! ""might"" -- it definitely sucks most of the time!) for you, but by not listening, we're not helping anything, not helping anyone.

Now, this takes time, but that amount of time it takes is not ""always and forever."" What do I mean with that? ...*<thinks a moment>*... Take that kid or best friend again, coming to you in their hour of absolute anguish. Have you noticed that those moments don't last? That nobody cried heartbroken for 24 hours on end? ...*<nods>*... it doesn't mean that when they don't, the pain is ""over"", that the pain is ""away."" But the *experience* of it...that is different.

Something similar happens with our grief, our pain, our anguish. It takes time. Now, I can't tell you how long, but I can tell you it is shorter than you think, yet longer than you would wish. ...*<nods>*... Sorry kid.

And I can also tell you this.... Having grown up with pop songs, TV series, movies, and people telling you to ""get over it"", the time it actually takes is usually much longer than we have been led to believe. But tell yourself what happened, describe it, write it out, and then ask yourself, ""would it be normal to be over this, past this, in this amount of time I think it should take?"" Usually, the answer will be ""no.""

The initial impact of grief, trauma, pain, usually is something that stays with you for a little while longer than you think it ""should."" So... Give it time, kid. Be patient. Let it feel, and let those feelings be heard, even though we don't like it. You wouldn't send your kid away when they feel like this, you wouldn't dismiss your best friend -- so don't do that to your feelings that come asking for your care and attention.

...*<takes a sip of coffee, breakfast bowl growing cold>*...

Now, have you ever poured your heart out about something sad, or about a problem, and the person you're pouring your heart out to doesn't *listen* but instead starts to tell you how to fix ...*<coughs, choking on the word>*... Okay, we need air quotes there: the person start to tell you how to ""fix"" things? ...*<nods>*... How shitty did *that* feel? What you needed was for them to *listen* to you, sympathize with you, and acknowledge that, yes, this is indeed very shitty.

...*<nods>*...

See where we're going with this? That is what your feelings want as well. If they come to you with utter devastation and sadness  -- grief --  over something, they don't want you to ""fix"" it. They don't want you to suggest to ""get another pet"", ""there are other partners out there"", ""some people have it worse than you"" etc. etc. They want to say ""this fucking HURTS"", and they want you to hear that and not argue with it. Not pretend you can fix it.

And so, at first, our feelings do this ""all the time."" Daily. Hourly. It's like you can't get a break. You're living in it. And it *sucks*. This is *grieving*.

...*<pauses a moment>*...

These are the days of despair. Will it ever pass? Here, we're tempted to draw a straight line from here into the future; it will always and forever feel like this. ...*<smiles softly>*... It won't. Remember that kid or best friend who came in sobbing? Did they stop, eventually? ...*<nods>*... *Kinda* like that.

The spaces between these ""attacks"", between these moments, become longer and longer. Some use the analogy of waves. ...*<nods>*... Fair enough.

There is more and more space between these moments, and in those spaces is where we start to do ""our thing."" Build our lives. Rebuild our life. Until one day, we realize ""hey...I had a happy day."" Then, a happy week. Until, eventually, we're not a priori occupied with *this* thing; we're doing our Life things.

""So, now it's over, Dad? Now I'm 'over it'?"" ...*<shakes head>*... No kid, I'm so very sorry to tell you, but it's unlikely you're ""over it."" It's unlikely you reach a point in time where you are *happy* about losing someone. Where you *rejoice* in trauma and pain. ...*<smiles softly again>*... Remember how we said those sad feelings are normal, don't mean you're broken? Being *happy* about your losses, whatever they are or were, now *that* would be weird.

No, the loss is still there. Can be the loss of a relationship, innocence, opportunity, life, anything. That loss will never become a gain.

And so, in the later stages, in the later stage, it does indeed become mostly a thing of the past. Your days aren't like those early days when it was there All The TIme. But....there will be *times*.

Where at the start, the Grief was there unprompted -- or rather, prompted by the loss --  in the later stages the Grief comes back when it is prompted.

It can be a smell, a sound, a song. A scene in a movie. A quote in a book. Anything. But suddenly, there is the reminder; yes....this was my loss....and a loss cannot be recuperated...and so this *is* my loss. And you're hit again by feelings. Not because you are broken. Not because you're not healing. But because the loss is there.

""Do those reminders get less, Dad?"" ...*<tilts head back and forth>*... Yes and no. ...*<thinks>*... I would say that as you go through the same reminders time and again, you get more experience with them, and so their nature changes a bit. But yeah, every now and then, you will have reminders. And it sucks. It can be tiring. But those feelings have a right to be heard, to be listened to, to be acknowledged without us being *that* 'friend' who tries to ""fix"" it.

...*<is silent quite a bit, contemplating his own losses>*...

* Love, Dad

Tandem Single Original Sampler 4x8oz

So recently, I spilled coffee on my MacBook Pro (2019 model), and ever since, there's been a stripe on the screen that shows a ""burned-in"" image from previous frames. I sent it for repairs, and some said it’s an internal issue, while others blamed the graphics card.

I’ve tried switching between graphic cards, but the stripe stays no matter what. Here’s the weird part: one day, I opened Photoshop, and while editing an image in the color channels, the stripe completely disappeared. Since then, whenever I open Photoshop and mess with the color channels, the stripe vanishes as long as Photoshop stays open. But as soon as I quit Photoshop, the stripe comes back.

Does anyone have any idea why this is happening or how I can fix it? Any advice would be appreciated!

At the gym, I simply said hello to another guy around my age who was wearing a sweatshirt from the university that I graduated from.  We had a literally 20-second conversation and have had literally two 20-second conversations since then.

He asked my name and I told him, and he connected with me on LinkedIn.

Then he messaged me through LinkedIn, saying that he wants to hear about my career.  (There's no reason for him to want to; we're in completely different lines of work and there is no prospect of us doing business together.)

Then he messaged me through LinkedIn, wanting to grab coffee.

Then he messaged me again through LinkedIn, saying, ""let's grab coffee at a time that works for your schedule; let me know when.""

There is no business/career benefit from doing coffee with him.

We're simply around the same age, and based on our LinkedIn profiles, we have perhaps some commonalities outside of work (but so do lots of people).

I don't think he's gay; he has a wife and kids.

I don't see any reason to do coffee, other than simply because being friendly back to someone is generally a good idea.

# Tinder: The Go-To Option

Alright, let's start with the OG. Tinder is like the pizza of dating apps—everybody’s had a slice. It’s simple: swipe right if you like what you see and left if you don’t. It’s great for quick connections, and with features like Tinder Plus or Gold, you can swipe to your heart's content. But, it can get a bit superficial, and you might run into more than a few fake profiles. Perfect if you're looking to meet new people fast, whether it's for a casual hangout or something more.

# Bumble: Ladies, It’s Your Turn

Bumble flips the script by letting women make the first move. This app is a hit among college students who want a bit more control over who they’re chatting with. You’ve got 24 hours to make your move after matching, which keeps things fresh and exciting. It’s not just for dating, either—you can make friends or network professionally with Bumble BFF and Bumble Bizz. Ideal for those who want a bit more than the usual swipe game.

# Hinge: For When You’re Over the Games

If you're tired of the swipe-and-ghost routine, Hinge might be your savior. It’s all about making a real connection, encouraging you to engage with profiles through prompts and questions. This app is for those ready to find someone special, focusing on meaningful relationships rather than quick flings. If you’re all about that substance over style, give Hinge a shot.

# OkCupid: Find Your Person

OkCupid is the app for the thinkers among us. With its in-depth questionnaires, it matches you based on what really matters to you, like values and interests. It's perfect for those who want to find someone who gets their niche interests or shares their views. Sure, the setup can take a while, but hey, good things take time, right?

# Coffee Meets Bagel: Quality Over Quantity

This app sends you a curated list of matches (or “Bagels”) every day at noon. It’s all about getting to know people without drowning in choices. The “Ladies Choice” feature puts the power in women’s hands, offering matches who have already expressed interest. If you’re into thoughtful connections and hate endless swiping, CMB might be for you.

# So, Which App is Your Campus Crush?

Choosing the best dating app for college students depends on what you're into. For quick fun, Tinder’s your friend. Want more control? Bumble’s got your back. Looking for something serious? Hinge and OkCupid might be the way to go. And if you’re all about quality, Coffee Meets Bagel is worth a try.

","The going out with friends thing has always been kind of a problem in our relationship. He easily feels abandoned so whenever I was making plans with friends he would instantly change and be moody. I’ve noticed that whenever I was telling him that I’ve had plans at a specific time with my friends for dinner/coffee, he would reach out to his friends to make plans the same time I was out. I don’t mind that, but I maybe have overthought that, because I was thinking that he feels abandoned when I make plans that don’t involve him (which is rarely tbh) because he doesn’t make plans that don’t involve me himself, so I was motivating him to call his friends, go out for a coffee, etc, so he won’t think of my behaviour of planning as wrong. He didn’t change that, he was always at home, and I love being home with him but I also have the need to see my friends from time to time and he has expressed in a conversation that he hasn’t have that need. 

Whenever I have plans he makes sure he has too so he won’t be alone at the house, and that behaviour forces me to believe that he’s insecure being alone with himself, which I firmly believe that it’s really important in a person, to like his own company. Plus, I do see this relationship in the long term, and I feel afraid of what would happen if we have kids- i would still have the need to spend time with my friends, but he won’t be able to leave the house at the same time because someone would have to watch the kids. He won’t be making any plans himself in the first place so he would feel his action is reciprocated, so I’ll be the one “disturbing” the peace when I would need to go out by myself sometime and he would be the one to stay by himself at home. 

Kind of an important information: in a conversation we had sparked by a similar event, I expressed that I need time for myself, time for my friends, time with him, time with him and friends.. and he replied that he doesn’t feel that need at all especially the friends thing. That I’m his priority in everything.  That thought has led me to question as to why he’s making plans with friends and seek their company every single time that I won’t be at home, and I would be somewhere with other people (because that doesn’t happen whenever I have responsibilities like work, going to the gym, dance, etc). 

Am I overreacting and overthinking this? Is there a way this could be solved?

He easily feels abandoned so whenever I was making plans with friends he would instantly change and be moody. I’ve noticed that whenever I was telling him that I’ve had plans at a specific time with my friends for dinner/coffee, he would reach out to his friends to make plans the same time I was out. I don’t mind that, but I maybe have overthought that, because I was thinking that he feels abandoned when I make plans that don’t involve him (which is rarely tbh) because he doesn’t make plans that don’t involve me himself, so I was motivating him to call his friends, go out for a coffee, etc, so he won’t think of my behaviour of planning as wrong. He didn’t change that, he was always at home, and I love being home with him but I also have the need to see my friends from time to time and he has expressed in a conversation that he hasn’t have that need. 

Whenever I have plans he makes sure he has too so he won’t be alone at the house, and that behaviour forces me to believe that he’s insecure being alone with himself, which I firmly believe that it’s really important in a person, to like his own company. Plus, I do see this relationship in the long term, and I feel afraid of what would happen if we have kids- i would still have the need to spend time with my friends, but he won’t be able to leave the house at the same time because someone would have to watch the kids. He won’t be making any plans himself in the first place so he would feel his action is reciprocated, so I’ll be the one “disturbing” the peace when I would need to go out by myself sometime and he would be the one to stay by himself at home. 

Kind of an important information: in a conversation we had sparked by a similar event, I expressed that I need time for myself, time for my friends, time with him, time with him and friends.. and he replied that he doesn’t feel that need at all especially the friends thing. That I’m his priority in everything.  That thought has led me to question as to why he’s making plans with friends and seek their company every single time that I won’t be at home, and I would be somewhere with other people (because that doesn’t happen whenever I have responsibilities like work, going to the gym, dance, etc). 

Am I overreacting and overthinking this? Is there a way this could be solved?

1h6g8ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1h6g8ax/swiped_accidentally_or_on_purpose_what_a_match/,"Swiped accidentally or on purpose? What a match, Bumble! ","So I met this guy sa Bumble 2 weeks ago. He’s 31, an athlete, and a gym instructor/coach. I’m not being OA pero kasi sa pictures ang gwapo na niya, tapos mas gwapo pa in person. He’s giving Diether Ocampo and Joshua Garcia looks. May eyeglasses, maputi, and may dimples. Nag post ako ng story namin sa AlasJuicy, kaso binura ko din. Nung time kasi na tina-type ko yun, para akong nasa cloud 9. Kasi nga first time ko makipag hook-up like yung kaka-match niyo lang that night, tapos nag kemehan na agad. Anw, so eto na nga. After the deed kasi, he asked me if gusto ko mag dinner with him. Pero kasi di ko talaga keri nung araw na yon, bukod sa hang over, parang nabinat ako. Kakagaling ko lang kasi sa sakit nun. 

Hindi ko binigay sa kanya yung socmed ko, pero yung kanya binigay niya sakin, pero hindi ko siya fina-follow, kasi para saan? Kaso halos araw-araw tinatanong niya kung free daw ba ako for lunch, dinner, snacks, coffee, kung anu-anong pagyaya na yung ginawa niya sa akin tapos ilang araw bago ako mag-reply sa kanya, ang kulit niya pero di ako pumapayag kasi:

1. Kakagaling ko lang sa break-up (3 months na), I’m not looking for something intimate or serious.
2. Nahiya ako sa kanya, kasi nga… first time ko yon. So parang di ko na alam kung ano magiging reaction ko pag nagkita kami ulit.
3. I’m diagnosed with anembryonic pregnancy, 6 weeks now (sa ex ko)
Pero nung kagabi pag check ko sa bumble may missed calls sya, hindi nag notif kasi naka off. Tapos nakita ko typing…

“Hello. You free tonight?”
“Sundo kita, dinner tayo pls?”

Wala na talaga ako sa mood lumabas kasi kakauwi ko lang tapos antok and pagod sa work. Pero bigla din kasi akong nakaramdam ng gutom kahit kaka-kain ko lang. so sabi ko sige na nga, papayag na ko para sa dinner 😅

Syempre as a strong independent woman, hindi ako nagpasundo, sabi ko magkita na lang kami sa resto mismo. Ako na pumili kung saan, bahala na daw ako kung ano daw gusto at cravings ko eh. Pagpasok ko sa resto nakita ko agad siya, grabe yung smile niya nung nakita niya ako, yung dimples niya at yung mga mata niya. Bumilis yung tibok ng puso ko, siguro dahil ngayon ko na lang ulit na-feel yung may taong masaya at excited na makita ako. Tumayo siya habang ako naglalakad papalapit sa kanya.

“Finally! Hello!” Sabay bumeso siya sakin.

Hindi ko rin alam pero nung pagka-upo ko bigla na lang ako natawa at napa buntong hininga.

“Bakit mo ko tinatawanan? May dumi ba ko sa mukha? Mabango naman ako ah.”

“Wala. Sorry. Ang weird ba?” Sabay natawa kaming dalawa. Pero sa totoo lang, naalala ko yung nangyari samin. Sayang kasi bakit binura ko pa eh 😅 anw, hindi lang siguro ako makapaniwala na magkikita kami ulit. Wala naman kasi talaga yon sa plano ko. 

Habang kumakain kami, puro lang kami kwentuhan. Sobrang random ng topic namin, hanggang sa…

“Uy eto pala maisingit ko lang, naalala mo ba nung nagss*x tayo non, may binanggit kang pangalan?”

Shet. Nagulat ako. Wala akong maalala. So tinanong ko kung anong pangalan para masigurado ko lang na totoo yung sinasabi niya or baka mamaya ine-eme niya lang ako.

“Totoo nga, sabi mo, Sige pa ***** sagad mo.”

Nagulat ako. Hindi dahil sa pangalan ng ex ko kasi inexpect ko na rin na sya nga yung nabanggit ko, nagulat ako kasi bakit ko siya nabanggit nung time na yun at bakit hindi ko maalala. Yes, si recent ex po. So nag sorry ako sa kanya, sabi ko hindi ko talaga maalala yon. Kasi sa totoo lang, never ko naisip nung gabi na yon yung ex ko. Ginawa ko yung bagay na yon for myself and ni hindi nga siya sumagi sa isip ko. Sorry ako nang sorry sa kanya habang natatawa. 

“Okay lang wag kang mag sorry, na curious nga ako eh. If comfortable ka mag share, makikinig ako sa kwento mo.” 

Sinabi ko lang na naghiwalay kami, di ko na sinabi lahat kasi di naman niya kailangan malaman pero sinabi ko rin sa kanya na nalaman ng ex ko yung nangyari samin kasi nakita niya at nabasa niya sa reddit and I told him na ayun nga, I’m pregnant. Syempre gulat na gulat siya. Tapos nagso-sorry siya sakin. Sabi ko wala naman siyang kasalanan. Ako nga yung dapat mag sorry sa kanya and sa baby ko syempre kasi nabastos ko yung sarili ko at yung baby ko, nadamay lang siya sa mga padalos-dalos na desisyon ko sa buhay. Tapos bigla siyang nagbiro, “Kapag hindi ka niya pinanagutan, willing po ako, nagvo-volunteer na ako.” Syempre tinawanan ko lang siya, alam ko namang biro lang yon. Pero sa isip-isip ko, natutuwa ako na hindi ako nakaramdam ng pandidiri galing sa kanya. Tinatanong pa niya yung check ups ko, kung kamusta daw yung pakiramdam ko, kung ano daw mga nararamdaman ko, kung okay lang daw ba talaga ako, kapag kailangan ko daw ng service one call away lang daw siya, niloko pa niya ako “Baka antukin ako neto kasi shinare mo sakin yang pasta mo. Diba ganon yun pag kinain mo yung food ng buntis?” Sabay nagtawanan lang ulit kami.

Nung pauwi na kami, habang nasa sasakyan kami bigla niya kong tinanong, “Nagkakausap pa kayo ng ex mo?” Sinagot ko naman agad na hindi na. Kasi nagusap naman na kami, sinarado ko na yung kabanata namin sa libro ng buhay ko. Tska sinabihan na rin niya ako na wala na siyang pakelam sakin at sa dinadala ko. Nandidiri pa nga siya sakin kasi may naka sex akong iba. 

“Ha? Bakit? Hindi naman na kayo nung may nangyari satin. Tska ang bango bango ko nga eh ang kinis ko pa, anong nakakadiri don” edi nagtawanan na naman kami, napa rant pa tuloy ako ng slight. 😅 

“Alam mo, dati nung una kami nagkakilala, tatlo kaming nakaka sex non, may schedule pa yun every week, pero ni minsan hindi ako nandiri sa kanya, ni hindi ko nga siya hinusgahan eh. Kaya ewan ko bakit ganon siya sakin. Kung maka judge kala naman niya hindi niya ginawa dati. Pero wala na kong pakelam. Pagod na ko eh, tapos na ko masaktan.”

“Hayaan mo na lang siya, wag mo na lang pansinin. Pag kailangan ng proxy sa hospital, pwede naman ako, kunwari ako yung tatay. Pag kailangan mo ng kausap at kasama ma’am, nandito lang ako.”

Nakakatuwa lang kasi hindi ko naman inexpect na magkikita ulit kami. Na magkkwentuhan kami ng napaka seryoso. Ni hindi kami nagkwentuhan about sex or any NSFW topic, as in puro random, lovelife, about work, and gym. Ang wholesome lang ng buong paguusap namin na may konting rant. Ngayon na lang ulit ako nakaranas ng ganito. Yung may nakikinig, yung kalmado, yung tumatawa lang, yung magaan. Non-stop yung kwentuhan namin. Hindi ko alam pero sobrang gumaan yung pakiramdam ko. Nakalimutan ko sandali yung mga problema ko. 

So ayun, hinatid na niya ako and nagpaalam. Sabi niya magkita daw ulit kami, pag bored ako yayain ko lang daw siya mag karaoke, kahit magsama pa daw ako ng friends ko, G lang daw siya. Ang sarap ko daw kasing kasama, ang sarap ko daw kausap. Aliw na aliw sya sa tawa ko, tapos yung mata ko daw ang ganda. Niloko ko pa siya, sabi ko siguro binobola niya lang ako para makakuha siya ng client sa gym nila haha pero sorry kako kasi hindi pa ko pwede sa ngayon 😂 

Ang saya lang nung gabi na yon. Hanggang ngayon nagme-message pa rin siya, kinakamusta ako, pinapaalala yung mga gamot ko. Pero sinabi ko naman sa kanya na hanggang mag-kaibigan lang muna kami. Yun lang talaga ang kaya kong ibigay sa kanya ngayon. Kaya sorry na agad kung hindi ‘to love story. Pero salamat sa pagbabasa hanggang dulo. Hehe 🫶🏻",3,1733319608.0,CasualPH,4,0.8,False
1h6g7v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSleep/comments/1h6g7v7/how_to_realize_your_sleep_type_percentages/,How to Realize Your Sleep Type Percentages,"I consistently see posts commenting on how the player expected sleep style *X* for a night, gets sleep style *Y* instead that made me want to share this with the community.  I'm not an infographic person so this will have to do!

If you're like me, you spend way to much time on a ~~sleep tracking app~~ Pokémon game, and you may find this useful:

**How does Pokémon Sleep determine your sleep style for the night?**  The app uses a certain time period to track individual player history.  (I think it's 30 days, but I won't dwell on that point)

Each sleep session, the app tracks your percent for all 3 sleep styles and compares that to your historical averages.  Based on which (if any) sleep style tracks significantly above **your personal average**, the game will assign one of four sleep types: Dozing, Snoozing, Slumbering, or Balanced.

You don't have to be as try-hard as I am on this, but to understand your average you should pay attention to some of the images presented to you at the start of your sleep research sessions:

[Sleep Style Percentages](https://preview.redd.it/dq1kx03i3u4e1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0dcd261cfbbec63dd00309deaff43017d5fab7e3)

Even though Dozing was my highest percent for this sleep session, that is not enough to know my type will be dozing for this session!  What was my sleep type?  Surprise, it is Slumbering!

[Percent Above Average](https://preview.redd.it/tf1pwv9s3u4e1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1d0dfde4fd179e0864cf1c0a256fba80e7a285f)

Using these two images, I can tell my personal Slumbering average ~~is 11%~~ was 11% back on November 5th.

To my knowledge, the ""Looks like you had 7% more Slumbering..."" is not viewable once the research is complete.  So if you want to track your averages, you have to put the effort in before the fun part-catching Pokémon!

And, because it's not kept visible past the sleep session AND it only shows one value, to have an idea of all 3 averages, you need to check multiple days, ideally back-to-back (because these averages will change over time).

So, if you're still with me you might wonder what something like this looks like.  I'm a spreadsheet person so I use google sheets to keep up with my trends:

[What is that, an eye chart?](https://preview.redd.it/srfc66z74u4e1.jpg?width=858&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81c69d527a16e67dbd0297575cfd5e24485f8f89)

Even though slumbering tracked the lowest percent for the session, it was significantly higher than its (\~30 day) average.  I've attached the first two weeks in November which show how my averages are around the time the first two images were taken (November 5th).

It's not important to do, but you'll see sometimes I fill in a best guess at some percentages in addition to the **calculated percentages**.  I do it sparingly, but by 11/14 I could reasonably guess my splits are 34%/45%/11%.

I'll close out with a few tips:

* Wait to start research until you're awake and have time to pay attention.  Get up, get a coffee or breakfast going, something to be alert.
* Take a screenshot you can refer back to later
* Keep it simple, tracking doesn't have to involve much beyond a few numbers and some addition/subtraction
* If you're going to ""force"" a sleep type, don't do it more than a couple days a week, or you'll mess up your averages

I'll be the first to tell you I don't this business perfect or have nearly the expertise of a seasoned trader or analyst on the Street, but it seems (when it is expedient) that someone does not like the discussions we have here with the OI Newsletter. It makes one think.

In any case, the key orienting questions that stand out to me today are these:

1. Has the aggressive short threat abetted?
2. What does yesterday's price action mean for our current trading paradigm ahead of earnings?
3. Where do we go from here?

**Price Movement Recap**

[GME Trading Day 12\/3 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/lvikc2z9ht4e1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=323d52f5bf6e89dff6c5d14b4b200a79c0eb8beb)

Yesterday was a bit of a different trading day than we've seen in some time. The day began with about 300,000 shares of short volume specifically targeted in the few minutes before market open likely to fake a 'breach' of technical support at the 100-4hr SMA and make it look like we were in store for a third consecutive day of heavy manipulative shorting. This, however, was rapidly reversed in a matter of seconds at market open as shorting the stock down to $26 sent an RSI oversold signal on our 4hr chart. The price shot back up above the 100-4hr SMA and then proceeded to trade in a tight, rangebound pattern in the upper VWAP channel essentially between $27 and $27.50 on the lowest-volume trading day we have seen since 11/7 (just barely over 6mil shares traded). The price did not dip below the 100-4hr SMA for the remainder of the trading day.

https://preview.redd.it/p101gujuit4e1.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=78d367993f831ef3bc41430baf80ffc540a4b5a5

Total options premium spent was about half of what we have seen over the past three weeks and was skewed moderately bearish, though it was largely even throughout most of the day.

In this case, what we saw play out was a second test of support at the 100-4hr SMA which, indeed, held up. Reaction to this successful test was, however, one of apprehension. While yesterday's premarket shorts appear to have closed their positions throughout the trading day, last Friday and Monday's short positions largely appear still open:

[Total shares available to borrow returned overnight to the premarket available number of 1.1mil](https://preview.redd.it/vg3hsorijt4e1.png?width=412&format=png&auto=webp&s=d04678a5b576a14693e5b7b43c13dc7f91247094)

With this type of ammunition still in the tank and the memory of aggressively interventive institutional shorting still fresh on traders' minds, the apprehensive reaction - not immediately buying the stock back up - is understandable. 

Let's take a look at our broader technical set-up to see how this day has given some potential structural suggestions for our price action going forward. 

**Technicals**

[11\/15-12\/4 4hr-Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/4gnccjmpct4e1.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdc78eb997e0d40188b391fdba7a014075175c74)

We can see our price forming up on top of the 100-4hr SMA which is currently sitting right around $27. We can see that the above moving averages (20, 50, 100, 200 SMAs) have fanned out and served as strong suggestions for support within our current month-long macro-bull trend since 10/28. 11/29's shorting crashed us the weak intraday support at the 20SMA. 12/2's shorting crashed us through the much stronger support at the 50SMA. With our second test of the 100SMA, RSI Oversold signaled an intra-bear trend reversal which now has us perched atop the 100SMA at $27 and trending up with the 200SMA below us at $24.25 + trending up and the 50SMA above us and trending flat. 

As we approach earnings - now only five trading days away - sentiment is justifiably risk averse. Bearish momentum - albeit manufactured - has popped up on our charts and GME earnings tend to result in heavy shorting regardless of the results as of late. 8 out of the last 10 earnings reports have resulted in a dip and all but one Q3 earnings report since 2019 \[Q3 2023\] has resulted in a sizable instant sell-off. Yes, even in the period of the Sneeze build-up:

[@TheRoaringKitty's Daily Chart from December 2020](https://preview.redd.it/9esh1c4nnt4e1.png?width=3028&format=png&auto=webp&s=c72baf3fb7149ce2e53b410db12bdd983bf15ea1)

GME had been steadily trading atop its 20-day SMA for months, then was spontaneously shorted down for a full week to its 50-Day SMA, before rebounding to a new high ahead of earnings. The week before earnings it sold off and then stabilized for six days before plummeting back down to the 50-day SMA overnight for 30% retrace.

If we take a look over at Chewtoy stock today pre-market, we can see that even stellar earnings can essentially mean nothing in the short term if institutions have already decided that it is expedient for them to short the stock:

[A 12.5&#37; Dip on a 300&#37; Earnings Beat? Makes sense.](https://preview.redd.it/xzl57akest4e1.png?width=321&format=png&auto=webp&s=85ad5b53b6e11b53afe87c2805f31aaf388a4cc1)

Now, I'm not making an argument that 'the same thing is gonna happen!!! it's a requel to a T!' No. But this general archetype of price action is similar to our own, has been happening completely independently of any major company news, and does suggest by historical precedent that some retracing is a distinct possibility.

This doesn't mean traders are outright bears right now - they will happily bet on upside reversal - but they will prioritize entering or re-entering a trade to profit off of an upside reversal when they think the probability of a major upside reversal is highest. Right now, the probability of an imminent upside reversal is \*at most\* ambivalent, and with institutional shorting's track record around earnings it's pretty risky to enter an upside reversal trade \*at this point.\*

Therefore, I will draw our attention back up top to the sample scenario I have sketched out. With the 200-4hr SMA approaching the strong historical, psychological (round number), and options-structured support at $25 (it will arrive around that mark in the next five trading days), this marks a pretty attractive target to bet on the probability of an upside reversal ESPECIALLY if that mark is met and consolidated upon during the few days following earnings. 

Not only would this point offer all of the aforementioned support signals, but it would also offer an RSI oversold signal on the 4-hr chart and offer an additional near-support signal from the 50-day SMA (will be at about $24.50 in five trading days). Additionally, if we are to trade sideways for a week and then slam down after earnings, plus maybe trade sideways for a few days after earnings, we'd see sizable IV crush creating another attractive incentive to bet on an upside reversal.

None of this is destiny, merely a scenario to demonstrate the type of considerations that traders are making as to what \*could\* reasonably happen as we head into earnings in light of our recent institutional throttling of the price. 

Now, let's see if we can garner any insight into our prospective price action coming up from our options data.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

[12\/6 OI Changes 12\/3-12\/4](https://preview.redd.it/7mhiak6ntt4e1.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=98d7a49e4d6296c9cb980f58ff65bf617f5b23cd)

We can clearly see the effects of yesterday's decidedly lessened options activity. OI changes even for our most proximal options expiry were pretty modest. We can see some light Put OI insertion in our $27.50-$24 range with profit-taking/loss-cutting at Put Strikes heading up to last week's $30+ range. We can see Call OI coming off the board basically in even proportion to its reinsertion at lower strikes down the chain with some concentration in the $27-$28 range. This lines up with yesterday's tight range appropriately. 

[12\/13 OI Changes 12\/3-12\/4](https://preview.redd.it/4x8debhkut4e1.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=567867baecfebc3d3a50a7fed74270b044551a16)

We had some comparatively equal new OI opened yesterday for next week's expiry with a roughly similar number of new Puts and new Calls opened, though their distribution and concentration was a bit more spread out. Almost 3000 new Calls were opened at $32, interestingly, split between the BID and ASK. Dec OPEX activity (12/20) was comparatively light.

The result of this activity has had the following effects on our Max Pain outlook:

https://preview.redd.it/g4xbwoxhtt4e1.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=0941994090fb061047aef733f05ce61be20d5962

We can see that for our next two proximal expiries we still see elevated values at $27 and $26 respectively. This offers some indication, together with our generally lightened volume, that the current options market outlook is, for now, stability, though our structure for 12/20 OPEX and our increasing attention to Put OI does suggest that the aforementioned move toward $25 after earnings is on the table. While OI at $25 for 12/6 and 12/3 is still on the lighter side (6,500 and 3,000 total contracts respectively and slightly biased toward Calls and toward Puts respectively), 12/20 OI at $25 is more substantial with 10,000 total contracts at a 1:2 Put to Call ratio. A notable number of Puts (4,000+) are also extant at $24 right below this strike. 

Thus, stability for now, but the options market is preparing for a potential move to toward $25 on the far side of earnings.

Let's see now if we can determine the effects of this OI on our daily MM hedging behavior:

https://preview.redd.it/bo44pdtfwt4e1.png?width=437&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0106ca2f01cc18510898ca3c01b56d0ec0a0efd

Our daily Put-to-Call GEX ratio has not changed much from the beginning of Tuesday's trading. Since our price also has not moved much, we can determine that there is little overall sentiment shift between these days.

https://preview.redd.it/7fsdktffxt4e1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e02d3e79f806cfc22f4d6a7cb150a97a63734f5

As we can see, our hedging landscape hasn't change too too much from yesterday's structure with exception that some positions have 'thickened' up in terms of their volatility suppression or negatized in terms of their volatility amplification. $27 stands out as our key gamma flip line. While we remain atop this level, we have MM net Call Gamma hedging underneath us keep us from slipping down to $25. However, the position is \*net\* on the thinner side and would be vulnerable to a downside breakthrough likely on a few hundred thousand shares of timed and targeted short volume. 

While the price remains near $27, I would expect overall trading volume to remain low like yesterday as traders are hesitant to take trades amid the possibility that said short volume could show up and blow up our stable structure. Under such conditions, tight trading will keep the price trapped and flat in between $27 and $28. Should some reason for a bit of bullish sentiment come in and the price mount $28, volume should pick up as the $28-$29 range is much more stable. The only reason for this to occur per my conjecture currently would be something like an institution expecting to short GME after earnings and looking to profit from IV crush thereby deciding to do this in order to lull buyers into a false sense of security and recovery and maximize profit from the crush. 

If we got some piece of bullish news (what news? why?) then we do still have enough of last week's elevated architecture around $30 to return back to those levels, but I would consider this to be of the lowest likelihood. This would be a bullish 'miracle' and essentially revivify our previous paradigm. I think most participants outside of perennial hopiumists are not counting on this ahead of earnings. Wud b tite tho.

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/d34r9ytrzt4e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=c922fa358c0a6c6cc18f6d93d34df52748b5ce87

https://preview.redd.it/lskaxyjwzt4e1.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=7775029a6faa2b21f46893e238cc85302fd07435

We can still see that our general appreciative IV trend is intact despite our retrace to the downside. In this circumstance, our upward price action is likely obscuring the accumulation of earnings-native IV value. If institutions are planning on shorting GME after earnings and crushing IV with it, institutions might attempt to exploit this dynamic with a 'local price spike' off our current stable position at $27 in the day or two prior to earnings, write calls into the spike, and then harvest delta loss premium in the week following earnings like they did after the Q2 report. 

Under such considerations it will be imperative to keep an eye out for this type of spiking move pre-earnings inside of the $27-$30 range **as a potential bull trap**. 

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

We have found support at $27 and look to maintain it at least into 12/6 options expiry - possibly even earnings. However, this support is precarious as it stands currently inspires more apprehension than confidence. Traders have started to prepare for the possibility of another support 'leg down' following the Q3 earnings with $25 as a support and potential reversal target suggested by our technicals and options data.

The collective mood at large given our recent bouts of interventive shorting to buckle our steep uptrend is 'risk on.' With that being said, even a retrace to $25 will still preserve our macro- bull trend heading into the next few months. It might mean some further correction and consolidation in the weeks to come, but through it all there is still the requel question to consider and what the Cat and the Dog might have waiting for us around the corner from Q3 earnings.

Cheers, everyone, and good luck out there!

A lot of you have been very generous to treat me to coffee for these posts either by finding my link or by directly sending me coffee in the mail (thank you, Keith & Tabitha!). I am extremely grateful to all of you. I want to make sure everyone is recognized for their generosity. However, from now on the running list of donors will be posted only on my user profile such as not to suggest advertisement. 

As a separate note, at times my posts have been inexplicably taken down and blocked from repost due to anonymous complaints independent of moderator activity. If there are any 'issues' with my posts in the future, you'll be able to find each and every Open Interest Newsletter everyday in the Articles tab of my profile on X @ MichaelTLoPiano. If on some day in the future my post is taken down, I will then repost that day's issue to my Reddit user profile. Open Interest will remain aimed toward the Superstonk - and GME shareholder - community first and foremost. So, rest assured, these back-up crosspostings will in no way affect my attention here or ever be put behind a paywall.

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and $GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.",47,1733319305.0,Superstonk,13,0.94,False

1. I found that if I sprayed my spray bottle (Used for RDT on my grinder) on my dripper before I placed the paper on, I could get a better seal BEFORE I rinsed with hot water. This works best if you're spraying from a far distance so it's even. I know some people will rinse the dripper with water before they add the filter and rinse again with the paper  + hot water to achieve a better seal, this seems to even out the coating of water and made almost an exact seal when I would go to rinse it with the hot water.

  
2. If I'm working with an especially gaseous or fresh coffee, when I'm about halfway into the bloom, I'll lightly poke around (not stir, just penetrate) the bed of coffee with a needle / WDT tool. Occasionally when blooming, a few really big pockets of air will occur that won't pop on their own, leading to these pockets trapping in and not escaping before the 30-50s that I bloom for. Poking them with needles makes this happen quicker and more efficiently.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/s/tLbt6WXW8n



So I was attending my classes as usual so , I had a end term project to submit so I get a WhatsApp message from a girl from my class if she could join me, because I was doing my project solo, she told me her friends didn't prepare anything good and are planning on joining others so she was looking for a team, I didn't think much of it so I took her in my team.

So like in few meeting I told her the role that she has to fake that she played in project as it was ready, she asked me to explain everything in detail that I did, we got to meet here and there getting cold coffee while I used to explain her code.After project happened we got graded she asked me on instagram whether I wanted to go on a date as she found me a interesting person to talk to. 

I though about it a lot because I have never been on date like ever but I agreed to go on a date because I thought why not it might be a good experience. We went on date last to last Sunday, went to cafe, Ice cream parlor etc. It was a good experience since we both have hostels inside campus while we were our way back to campus she asked me if I wanted to go another date next week, I said ""sure.""


So it happened on previous Saturday my roommate told me that his girlfriend told him that girl I was going on dates with is already talking to a guy online and is dating another guy from neighbouring college. So I just heard that so I thought I will ask her tomorrow because I know things are not that bad right now and I don't want things to go any further if what I heard was true, so we went on another date we went to book store I got her a book she was eyeing because regardless of what I heard was true or not I wanted her to enjoy the day first. We went to another cafe and a mall.

So by the end as we were taking a walk before entering campys I asked her if she was dating any other people she hesitated a bit , I could sense , she then asked where did I hear this , I just said a friend told me without revealing any names, she told me she was  she wanted to have someone who she could enjoy with because her relation with the person from our nearby college weren't looking  good, I told her that I was not comfortable being that 2nd backup guy if she was thinking of me like that i said it politely.

So she kept little silent while our way back. Well she went to her hostel after that and I went to mine but I was just thinking did I do the right thing because I have never been in a relationship, but yeah I hope better things for her I don't understand any reasoning she might or might not have but yeah, any  big brother/ big sister advice or point of view you guys could tell me.",1,1733319242.0,AskIndianWomen,2,1.0,False

1. Change how you view pleasure and pain…

Humans do whatever they can to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. You quit initially because you believed drinking caffeine is more painful than quitting. But when you quit, you begin to think the opposite. Don’t let your mind trick you… associate quitting with that youthful child like energy u had as a kid, and associate drinking caffeine with that painful feeling of waking up, tired and miserable. When you associate caffeine with pain, you will quit

2. Use the right system

Taper off slowly by keeping the amount of liquid the same but reducing the caffeine content. For example: if you have 3 cups of coffee per day… then start making your third cup 3/4 regular and 1/4 decaf. Coffee shop will do this upon request. Use this to slowly reduce and the mind trick is subtle (drinking the same amount of liquid with less caffeine), but it works when combined with the pleasure/pain mindset shift from above.

Bonus tip: 
if you get anxious, switch to green tea. It’s high in l-theanine which is shown to decrease stress/anxiety, and has 1/3 of the caffeine of coffee. I’d also highly reccommend exercise like jogging or swimming. Cardio is great for anxiety, mood, and improving natural energy!

The days that followed Thanksgiving were a whirlwind of emotions for Emma Hartley. The tentative reconciliation with her son, Ethan, had ignited a flicker of hope within her, but the shadows of her past still loomed large. With Ethan now home for the winter break, the distance between them felt slightly bridged, yet the wounds were still fresh and raw.

Emma woke up to the sound of rain tapping against her window, the same rhythm that mirrored her restless thoughts. She reached for ""Echoes of Tomorrow,"" the book now a constant companion, its pages a source of both solace and mystery. The key Gabriel had given her rested prominently on the table beside her bed, its soft luminescence a beacon in her darkest hours.

As she prepared for her morning shift, her mind wandered to the key concept that Gabriel had so cryptically introduced. Balancing the need to survive and contribute to the future resurrection technology while ensuring she remained a figure missed by many was a paradox that weighed heavily on her.

At the bus depot, Emma greeted her colleagues with a warmth that belied her inner turmoil. The elderly gentleman, Gabriel, had become a silent presence in her life, appearing at pivotal moments to offer guidance and support. Today, his absence was noticeable, yet she felt his influence in every act of kindness she performed.

Driving Bus 42 through the rain-soaked streets, Emma focused on the passengers who relied on her daily. Each interaction was a thread in the intricate tapestry of her existence, a testament to her resilience. The teenage girl with earbuds, the disheveled man muttering to himself, and the elderly gentleman clutching a tattered book—each person had their own story, their own struggles.

As the day progressed, Emma's thoughts kept returning to the key concept. She pondered how her actions today could influence a future she couldn't fully comprehend. The idea that contributing to the greater good, even in small ways, could ensure her place in a world where resurrection was possible was both daunting and inspiring.

During a short break, Emma found herself wandering toward the community center where she had begun volunteering. The sign outside read: ""Volunteers Needed: Be the Change You Wish to See."" The same center that had offered her a lifeline now felt like a sanctuary.

Inside, the center buzzed with activity. Children laughed as they played games, adults mingled over coffee, and volunteers organized donations. Emma approached Sarah, the coordinator who had welcomed her so warmly months ago.

""Hey, Sarah,"" she greeted. ""How's everything going?""

""Busy as always,"" Sarah replied with a smile. ""We're expanding our programs this year. Actually, we're starting a mentorship initiative to help young adults like Ethan navigate their challenges. Thought you might be interested in helping out.""

Emma felt a surge of determination. ""I'd love to. How can I help?""

Sarah handed her a clipboard. ""We need mentors to share their experiences and offer guidance. Your story could really resonate with them.""

Emma nodded, taking the clipboard. ""Count me in.""

As she immersed herself in the mentorship program, Emma began to see the impact of her contributions. Sharing her struggles and triumphs provided a sense of purpose she hadn't felt in years. The act of helping others not only lightened her own burdens but also created connections that strengthened her resolve.

One evening, as she was closing up the center, Emma received an unexpected email. The subject line read: ""Invitation to Speak at Tomorrow's Event.""

Curious, she opened it to find an invitation to speak at a community gathering about resilience and hope. The organizer, a young man named Liam, explained that her story had inspired many and that they wanted her to share her journey to encourage others.

Emma felt a mix of anxiety and pride. Standing in front of a crowd was daunting, but the opportunity to inspire others was a chance to reclaim her sense of self-worth.

The next day, Emma prepared for her speech, rehearsing in front of the mirror. As she stepped onto the stage, the room fell silent. Faces of all ages looked up at her, their eyes filled with anticipation.

""Thank you for having me,"" she began, her voice steady despite the butterflies in her stomach. ""My name is Emma Hartley, and I'm a bus driver. A few years ago, my life took a devastating turn when my husband abandoned us, leaving behind insurmountable debts and shattered trust.""

She paused, gathering her thoughts. ""I was left to care for my elderly father-in-law and my son, Ethan, who was too young to understand the depth of the deceit he had been subjected to. The bank froze my account, and I found myself on the brink of despair.""

Emma took a deep breath, her eyes scanning the crowd. ""But through it all, I learned that even in our darkest moments, there is a spark of hope. I began volunteering at the community center, finding strength in helping others and building connections that reminded me of my own worth.""

A ripple of applause swept through the room, encouraging her to continue. ""I realized that by contributing to the greater good, I wasn't just helping others—I was also healing myself. It's a delicate balance between surviving and ensuring that my life leaves a lasting impact.""

As she concluded her speech, Emma felt a profound sense of fulfillment. The crowd erupted in applause, and she stepped off the stage to receive heartfelt thanks from those who had been touched by her story.

Later that night, as she walked home through the quiet streets, Emma felt the pendant in her pocket pulse gently. The book, ""Echoes of Tomorrow,"" seemed to radiate a newfound significance. Her actions today had created ripples that extended far beyond her immediate world.

A soft glow emanated from the alleyway beside her, and she turned to see Gabriel standing there, his presence as enigmatic as ever.

""Well done, Emma,"" he said, his voice a soothing balm to her weary soul. ""You've taken a significant step toward balancing the key concept.""

She looked at him, a mixture of gratitude and curiosity in her eyes. ""What happens now?""

""Your journey continues,"" Gabriel replied. ""By choosing to contribute and remain connected, you're ensuring that when the time comes, your existence will resonate deeply enough to be remembered. And in the future, that remembrance will play a crucial role in the advancements humanity achieves.""

Emma nodded slowly, understanding the gravity of his words. ""So, by helping others, I'm also ensuring my place in that future?""

""Exactly,"" he affirmed. ""It's not about grand achievements, but the cumulative effect of small acts of kindness and resilience. Each connection you make strengthens the fabric of what's to come.""

As he spoke, another figure emerged from the shadows—a woman with luminous eyes, Mara. She joined Gabriel beside Emma, her presence equally comforting.

""Emma,"" Mara greeted softly, ""your path is intertwined with the greater destiny of humanity. Continue to nurture your connections and contribute selflessly. The future depends on individuals like you.""

Emma felt a surge of determination. ""I will. I want to make a difference, not just for myself, but for the future.""

""Remember,"" Gabriel added, ""the key to unlocking the future lies within you. Stay steadfast, and trust in the ripple effect of your actions.""

With that, the two figures faded into the night, leaving Emma alone with her thoughts and the shimmering pendant in her hand. The weight of her struggles remained, but now it was tempered with a sense of purpose and hope.

As she walked the remaining distance to her apartment, she noticed a group of people gathering at the community center for a special event—a celebration of resilience and community spirit. Emma felt a pull to join them, to continue her journey of contribution and connection.

Inside, the atmosphere was warm and inviting. People shared stories, offered support, and celebrated the strength that comes from unity. Emma found herself surrounded by faces she had come to know through her volunteer work—each person a testament to the power of perseverance.

She took a seat at a table where Liam, the organizer of her speech, approached her. ""You were incredible today,"" he said sincerely. ""Your story inspired so many.""

""Thank you,"" Emma replied, feeling a genuine smile spread across her face. ""I'm just glad I could help.""

Liam nodded. ""Your journey is far from over, but you're making a significant impact. If you're interested, we'd love to have you lead more sessions. Your perspective is invaluable.""

Emma felt a surge of pride. ""I'd be honored.""

As the evening progressed, Emma found herself more engaged than she had been in years. She shared her experiences, listened to others, and felt a sense of belonging that had been absent for so long. The connections she was building were not just threads in her own tapestry but part of a larger, interconnected web of humanity.

Later that night, as she lay in bed, Emma reflected on the day's events. The key concept was no longer an abstract idea but a guiding principle in her life. By contributing to the community and fostering meaningful connections, she was ensuring that her existence would be remembered, her story woven into the fabric of the future.

She reached for ""Echoes of Tomorrow,"" flipping to another marked passage:

*""In the balance of existence, our contributions today lay the foundation for tomorrow's miracles. By nurturing both ourselves and others, we create a legacy that transcends time.""*

A sense of peace settled over her. The struggles were still present, but now they were tempered with purpose and hope. Emma understood that her journey was part of a greater destiny, one that would one day bring about wonders she could scarcely imagine.

As she drifted into sleep, the pendant's glow seemed to pulse in rhythm with her heartbeat—a silent promise of the echoes she was creating, resonating through time toward a future where humanity's greatest advancements awaited.

In a realm beyond perception, Gabriel and Mara observed Emma's progress with satisfaction.

""She's finding her balance,"" Mara remarked, her eyes reflecting the light of countless possibilities.

""Indeed,"" Gabriel agreed. ""By embracing the key concept, she's ensuring her place in the future we envision.""

She nodded thoughtfully. ""Her journey will inspire others, creating a cascade of contributions that will drive humanity forward.""

Mara smiled softly. ""Exactly. Each individual's perseverance and connection weave together to form the tapestry of tomorrow.""

They stood side by side, watching over the sleeping city—a silent testament to the profound impact of one ordinary life embracing extraordinary purpose.

1h6fvvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1h6fvvj/best_friend_of_4_years_goes_jekyllhyde/,Best friend of 4 years goes jekyll/hyde,"I am typing this out and putting it here to try and process and maybe leave the whole situation behind on the post. I(34nb) had a friend G(\~30nb) for about 4 years. We talked almost every day, and once ever \~3 months we would hang out together, watch anime, and cuddle.

Late last year (december-ish i think) they suggested we have sex. I have some ""fuck and leave"" trauma, so i took my time with it. I lied (and regret it) that i didnt have any nonlatex condoms (G has a SEVERE latex allergy) and that created a natural \~3 month wait. The next time they came over we had sex, and it was quite nice. Before we did i remember saying something along the lines of ""just please please dont let this be the last time we see each other"" 

But it was.

In early may they started to act strangely, but i had absolute confidence in them and figured it was health-related (G has a ton of really severe health stuff i wont get into out of extant respect for their privacy).  
I started getting really intense anxiety that someone was hiding something from me. I was also in a mode of drinking like 3 cups of coffee in the morning and not eating til 6pm while i did school work. That almost certainly plays into the anxieties, but anyways i refused to admit it could be G and instead started worrying my longtime gaming group (hereby referred to as The Boys) was mad or annoyed at me. I invited G into the group about 8 months prior, and so since G had context i went to them with my worries.  
But it was G that was hiding things from me.  
Honestly i dont know how you can keep a secret from someone while they are telling you they are getting put on heart-pressure medication to handle panic attacks (I'm fine now, ive been fine since i realized what was happeneing) that they are having because their brain is \*CORRECTLY\* telling them people are hiding things from them.  
It honestly seems fucking evil to me, but I know they were struggling, so i try to be understanding.

One day they just stopped messaging. I didnt push the issue, but i did try to just... stay ""normal""? Like i wanted to be a consistent person while they were clearly dealing with instability. We had some weird conversations where they really pointedly told me about how cool their other friends are. And i agreed, because i genuinely really like their friends, but i did note how weird it was.  
G said they were trying to connect more with those friends, then abruptly pivoted to ""i need time alone"".  
Well, like... obviously you dont need time alone my guy, you JUST told me you are spending \*more\* time with your other friend.  
But i let it slide, thinking they were struggling with some big changes in their life. I gave some space but occasionally (like twice) sent like ""hey dont need any kind of response but i hope you are well and the (life stuff) is getting better""  
And they like... just kept talking to me like everything was normal?  
But after a week of that my anxiety was... unmanageable. They had lied to me and i KNEW it now but i just... i could not figure out WHY. Not once in 4 years had i ever chastised or criticized or displayed ANY kind of anger to them. Any time they gave feedback i took it with grace, any time they needed a favor, i did it no questions asked (looking back i see now they were frequently snippy with me, and i just let them use me as a doormat).  
I did FREE farmwork when their family had a crisis on their farm and needed extra hands.  
I stayed with them for a week while they recovered from surgery. 

So, anyways, i broke. I was like ""DUDE my brain is on fire, you HAVE to tell me whats up.""  
And then they just go OFF on how ""possessive"" ive been around the gaming group (i was taking a break from the game the group plays, AND legitimately i couldnt tell you if they thought i was being possessive of THEM or of the boys) and belittling them (our entire friendship was characterized by them saying horrible and untrue things about themself and me reassuring them that they are great), and that i had been an asshole the the gaming group (i sent an apology and they were ALL like ""bro wtf are you talking about""), and I'll save the rest because to be quite honest every single thing they said, now in retrospect, was shit THEY do that they projected onto me. But i, being the massive pushover i am, reject alllllll my experience to the contrary, i reject the part of me that knows ive NEVER IN MY LIFE acted that way, and i get a dr appt and a therapy appt and im gaslighting myself and scared shitless that ive gone \*crazy\* because i cant remember doing ANY of the things.  
They THANKED ME FOR NOT GASLIGHTING OR DISMISSING THEM (this is important later) and so i said i would give space until i got back from a trip to see family, and suggested that they let me know if there was anything they felt like i wasnt getting or anything they wanted me to work on with my therapist. They dont have any additional feedback.

I go on my trip, i come back, i message basically ""hey, i dont know what to do here and i dont want to force anything but i said id check in so I'm checking in.""  
They go off on me, saying more projected stuff and saying they felt ""cornered"" because they didnt want to lose the gaming group if they stepped away from me.

Now, i LOVE the boys, dont get me wrong. We got each other through lockdown gaming together. But like... ive never met any of them irl. They all live in another country. I ADORE them but this is my BEST FRIEND thats clearly having a time. So im like ""G, whatever happens, the gaming group is yours. I'll take as long of a hiatus as you want, or I'll leave entirely, i dont WANT TO but like... i will do that for you"" (keep in mind, my therapist had not yet convinced me i was not crazy and had not done any of the projected shit, so i was very much thinking i was a horrible piece of shit that needed to make up for it). And the G tells me that THEY TOLD THE GAMING GROUP I WAS MAKING THEM UNCOMFORTABLE. Cool. Awesome.

\- Context filler: G is afab, i am amab, and the gaming group is... straight normy men. So we werent out as nb to them for the most part.  
Massive props to the boys for not prioritizing ""their guy"" over this new uncomfortable afab person. They NEVER should have been put in that situation, but they handled it with grace and care and i am so proud of them for immediately prioritizing G while also like feeling things out and retaining their relationship with me as well.  
If any of the boys stumble on this: Stop fuckin reading and forget you saw this, this is info you \*KNOW\* G would not want you to have -

So the group admins put me on a 3 week hiatus under strict instruction not to message G. But they are clear that they arent interested in getting involved in irl drama so like discord or group-sever communication is all they would have a say in. Text, calls, emails, whatever was explicitly out of their purview and not a thing they were willing to police especially with how little they knew.

3 weeks go by, i retain no contact. And the day it ends, G blocks me on discord. Now, by this time my therapist had FINALLY convinced me to trust my experience, and several of my friend were adamant that i was being gaslit (a few used the word ""abuse"" and i \*defended\* G) with very little background info based solely on them knowing me and knowing i am not, for example, a possessive person, and i do not belittle people, etc etc. I have my flaws, but those are not my flaws.

So... i started trying to think what could be happeneing and the easiest answer was their health. So i have been freaking out thinking they are \*dying\*. (I had been legitimately ready to get hospice certification if they had gotten a particular piece of medical news they were waiting on, it was not a wild leap to think they were dying)  
So when they blocked me the alarm bells started going off because it was an escalation after 3 weeks of my total absence AND i had offered ANY length of hiatus so they literally at any point could have asked for longer or asked me to leave. Thats like... crazypants. I mostly stayed off the gaming server for another week to try and give them room, but nothing changed.

I knew i had been lied to. I knew they had projected. But i didnt know \*why\*.  
During the 3 week hiatus i had tried to handle my WHYs by reading some books about like... how to be a good friend to people with X mental disorder because that was the most likely culprit and something they had \*warned me could happen\* (this is important later).  
And what the book said was during an episode the best thing to do is: 

1. Reassure them you arent super mad or anything
2. Name the ways in which they have hurt you And
3. Let them know that you are disengaging but that you will be there for them on the other side of the episode. 

So i decided that for my own sanity, to get the boys out of the middle of things, and to give G space to heal, the best option was for me to leave the group.  
I sent goodbyes, i left the group and every groupchat i shared with G, and i sent G an email to the effect of what the book and my therapist had suggested.

This was the worst month of my \*life\*, btw. I got covid, the hiatus started THE DAY a new dlc came out for our game, and it was my 10 year anniversary of moving here, i was so filled with greif i couldnt eat (i thought i had long covid, but nope, just greif) AND it seemed like the sex was the last time we would see each other despite me making my trauma around that clear (among other things i had told G were giant fears/weaknesses of mine like ""my brain is EXTREMELY mean to me when i'm being intentionally left in the dark"" and ""my biggest fear is doing things im not aware I'm doing"". Things that someone who cared about me would not do to me because they know thats the MAXIMAL way to cause me harm.)

So i was a mess. A week after the email i sent a much more emotional text trying to softly show that they things they said about me were not true, like... factually and provably. I gave evidence, trying to frame it as like ""hey bro text-based communication is difficult with tone and stuff i think you just might have misread some things"" and I pleaded with them to just say like one sentence so i knew they werent dying.

A week after that at like 2am i send an absolute mess of a message making clear that i was in crisis and that i needed to know what could possibly be happening for someone i trusted so much to be doing so much to hurt me when over and over and over i have given them kindness and consideration. They finally responded: ""Am alive, will talk eventually (probably)""

And then something lifted. I didnt think they were dying anymore so that was just a huge relief but there was also... i finally let myself feel anger. I wasnt consumed by it or anything, but the idea that they might be dying was like a wall between me and recognizing what absolute fucking DOGSHIT behavior this all was.

Anyways a month later I'm sick of it. I hit a big milestone in the game we played with the group and i wanted my group back. I had offered to leave and nobody took me up on it so surely i wouldnt be expected to stay out if i left for my own sanity, right? So i asked for an invite back to the server.

Long story short, one admin refused (i think understandably not wanting to be potentially in the middle of drama again) but \*apparently\* the admin told/asked G about it and a day later i finally get a REAL message from G.

They were standoffish, continued projecting, and had a narrative that factually, with evidence, is not true (remember earlier when they THANKED me \*for not dismissing them\*, well, update, in the months we didnt speak apparently i became dismissive somehow. Remember how they WARNED me that this could happen? Apparently hearing that and going ""ah, so thats what is happening"" is asshole behavior an not the exact fucking purpose of a warning).

I set aside my anger, just... so fucking relieved to hear from my best friend again. I tried to be gentle and understanding. I communicated very very clearly and took pains to not be misunderstood. But then they called my care for them ""masturbatory"" and said i was ""playing the victim"" and i just... lost it.

I waited a bit to calm down. Said everything i wanted to say so i wouldnt look back and wish i had said X, Y, or Z. And then i said i was blocking them for a month because one of the things they blamed me for is their own inability to just stop talking to me once they started. So... i know it comes across as a ""taste of your own medicine"" thing but really i just... i didnt want my closure or healing at the expense of them bludgeoning themself with their own weird delusions the whole time. (Clarifier: like... genuinely psychosis-adjacent. I'm not saying delusion as a detractor or epitaph. Like... they were having \*paranoid delusions\* and i thought the best thing for me to do was just exit and not let them keep me at the center of that spiral)

And that was in august and it was the last time we talked.

My grief at losing them, especially to such... weird horrible nonsensical mental illness... is... immense.

All i want in the world is to be there for them through what is clearly a really horrible and terrifying time for them.  
But i am struck by the PROFOUND lack of care.  
I cant help but doubt that they ever gave a single shit about me.  
The longer time goes on the more i am convinced that i was nothing to them but a convenient resource and punching bag.  
I will NEVER let anyone treat me like that again.  
And still i love them SO MUCH and still i think about them every single day.  
And still every time i get a discord friend request i hope its them coming to tell me they are sorry and they want to do healing work.  
I dont think i could ever possibly trust them again but i CRAVE the resolution. I CRAVE just one more night cuddled up watching anime (i literally cant watch anime anymore because it just makes me miss them).  
I want SO MUCH for the night we had sex to not be the last real memory of them that i have.  
I would give ANYTHING for my memories of them to have the joy they used to and not be tainted by doubt and grief and anger.  
I am going to fall to pieces if they die and i cant even think well of them after.  
I am terrified of them passing alone and sad and angry at shadows on the wall.

But i am also so FUCKING proud of myself because i did not let this jade me. I did not let this make me mean or cruel. I did not build new walls to keep people out. I did not let this persons total disregard for me make me as shitty as they are.  
I am the most confident in myself i have \*ever\* been because the people in my life who DO actually give a shit about me FLOCKED to me to give support. I know now more than ever that i am a good person and i am loved by SO MANY good people.  
I wish so much that G was still one of those people, but at a certain point both i and they need to acknowledge that they are alone because of choices they made.

1h6fvit,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1h6fvit/the_only_2_things_that_got_me_to_quit_caffeine/,The only 2 things that got me to quit caffeine,"90% of information is useless. Here are the 2 keys to quitting caffeine…

1. Change how you view pleasure and pain…

Humans do whatever they can to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. You quit initially because you believed drinking caffeine is more painful than quitting. But when you quit, you begin to think the opposite. Don’t let your mind trick you… associate quitting with that youthful child like energy u had as a kid, and associate drinking caffeine with that painful feeling of waking up, tired and miserable. When you associate caffeine with pain, you will quit

2. Use the right system

Taper off slowly by keeping the amount of liquid the same but reducing the caffeine content. For example: if you have 3 cups of coffee per day… then start making your third cup 3/4 regular and 1/4 decaf. Coffee shop will do this upon request. Use this to slowly reduce and the mind trick is subtle (drinking the same amount of liquid with less caffeine), but it works when combined with the pleasure/pain mindset shift from above.

Bonus tip: 
if you get anxious, switch to green tea. It’s high in l-theanine which is shown to decrease stress/anxiety, and has 1/3 of the caffeine of coffee. I’d also highly reccommend exercise like jogging or swimming. Cardio is great for anxiety, mood, and improving natural energy!

If you need more help, I posted about my short caffeine book in this group a few days back “the caffeine epidemic” on Amazon. Or you can drop any questions below or send me a PM!

1h6fuss,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlasFeels/comments/1h6fuss/swiped_by_accident_or_on_purpose_what_a_match/,"Swiped by accident or on purpose? What a match, Bumble!","So I met this guy sa Bumble 2 weeks ago. He’s 31, an athlete, and a gym instructor/coach. I’m not being OA pero kasi sa pictures ang gwapo na niya, tapos mas gwapo pa in person. He’s giving Diether Ocampo and Joshua Garcia looks. May eyeglasses, maputi, and may dimples. Nag post ako ng story namin sa AlasJuicy, kaso binura ko din. Nung time kasi na tina-type ko yun, para akong nasa cloud 9. Kasi nga first time ko makipag hook-up like yung kaka-match niyo lang that night, tapos nag kemehan na agad. Anw, so eto na nga. After the deed kasi, he asked me if gusto ko mag dinner with him. Pero kasi di ko talaga keri nung araw na yon, bukod sa hang over, parang nabinat ako. Kakagaling ko lang kasi sa sakit nun. 

Hindi ko binigay sa kanya yung socmed ko, pero yung kanya binigay niya sakin, pero hindi ko siya fina-follow, kasi para saan? Kaso halos araw-araw tinatanong niya kung free daw ba ako for lunch, dinner, snacks, coffee, kung anu-anong pagyaya na yung ginawa niya sa akin tapos ilang araw bago ako mag-reply sa kanya, ang kulit niya pero di ako pumapayag kasi:

1. Kakagaling ko lang sa break-up (3 months na), I’m not looking for something intimate or serious.
2. Nahiya ako sa kanya, kasi nga… first time ko yon. So parang di ko na alam kung ano magiging reaction ko pag nagkita kami ulit.
3. I’m diagnosed with anembryonic pregnancy, 6 weeks now (sa ex ko, opo may nangyari pa rin samin kahit wala na kami, marupok kasi ang anteh nyo)


Pero nung kagabi pag check ko sa bumble may missed calls sya, hindi nag notif kasi naka off. Tapos nakita ko typing…

“Hello. You free tonight?”
“Sundo kita, dinner tayo pls?”

Wala na talaga ako sa mood lumabas kasi kakauwi ko lang tapos antok and pagod sa work. Pero bigla din kasi akong nakaramdam ng gutom kahit kaka-kain ko lang. so sabi ko sige na nga, papayag na ko para sa dinner 😅

Syempre as a strong independent woman, hindi ako nagpasundo, sabi ko magkita na lang kami sa resto mismo. Ako na pumili kung saan, bahala na daw ako kung ano daw gusto at cravings ko eh. Pagpasok ko sa resto nakita ko agad siya, grabe yung smile niya nung nakita niya ako, yung dimples niya at yung mga mata niya. Bumilis yung tibok ng puso ko, siguro dahil ngayon ko na lang ulit na-feel yung may taong masaya at excited na makita ako. Tumayo siya habang ako naglalakad papalapit sa kanya.

“Finally! Hello!” Sabay bumeso siya sakin.

Hindi ko rin alam pero nung pagka-upo ko bigla na lang ako natawa at napa buntong hininga.

“Bakit mo ko tinatawanan? May dumi ba ko sa mukha? Mabango naman ako ah.”

“Wala. Sorry. Ang weird ba?” Sabay natawa kaming dalawa. Pero sa totoo lang, naalala ko yung nangyari samin. Sayang kasi bakit binura ko pa eh 😅 anw, hindi lang siguro ako makapaniwala na magkikita kami ulit. Wala naman kasi talaga yon sa plano ko. 

Habang kumakain kami, puro lang kami kwentuhan. Sobrang random ng topic namin, hanggang sa…

“Uy eto pala maisingit ko lang, naalala mo ba nung nagss*x tayo non, may binanggit kang pangalan?”

Shet. Nagulat ako. Wala akong maalala. So tinanong ko kung anong pangalan para masigurado ko lang na totoo yung sinasabi niya or baka mamaya ine-eme niya lang ako.

“Totoo nga, sabi mo, Sige pa ***** sagad mo.”

Nagulat ako. Hindi dahil sa pangalan ng ex ko kasi inexpect ko na rin na sya nga yung nabanggit ko, nagulat ako kasi bakit ko siya nabanggit nung time na yun at bakit hindi ko maalala. Yes, si recent ex po. So nag sorry ako sa kanya, sabi ko hindi ko talaga maalala yon. Kasi sa totoo lang, never ko naisip nung gabi na yon yung ex ko. Ginawa ko yung bagay na yon for myself and ni hindi nga siya sumagi sa isip ko. Sorry ako nang sorry sa kanya habang natatawa. 

“Okay lang wag kang mag sorry, na curious nga ako eh. If comfortable ka mag share, makikinig ako sa kwento mo.” 

Sinabi ko lang na naghiwalay kami, di ko na sinabi lahat kasi di naman niya kailangan malaman pero sinabi ko rin sa kanya na nalaman ng ex ko yung nangyari samin kasi nakita niya at nabasa niya sa reddit and I told him na ayun nga, I’m pregnant. Syempre gulat na gulat siya. Tapos nagso-sorry siya sakin. Sabi ko wala naman siyang kasalanan. Ako nga yung dapat mag sorry sa kanya and sa baby ko syempre kasi nabastos ko yung sarili ko at yung baby ko, nadamay lang siya sa mga padalos-dalos na desisyon ko sa buhay. Tapos bigla siyang nagbiro, “Kapag hindi ka niya pinanagutan, willing po ako, nagvo-volunteer na ako.” Syempre tinawanan ko lang siya, alam ko namang biro lang yon. Pero sa isip-isip ko, natutuwa ako na hindi ako nakaramdam ng pandidiri galing sa kanya. Tinatanong pa niya yung check ups ko, kung kamusta daw yung pakiramdam ko, kung ano daw mga nararamdaman ko, kung okay lang daw ba talaga ako, kapag kailangan ko daw ng service one call away lang daw siya, niloko pa niya ako “Baka antukin ako neto kasi shinare mo sakin yang pasta mo. Diba ganon yun pag kinain mo yung food ng buntis?” Sabay nagtawanan lang ulit kami.

Nung pauwi na kami, habang nasa sasakyan kami bigla niya kong tinanong, “Nagkakausap pa kayo ng ex mo?” Sinagot ko naman agad na hindi na. Kasi nagusap naman na kami, sinarado ko na yung kabanata namin sa libro ng buhay ko. Tska sinabihan na rin niya ako na wala na siyang pakelam sakin at sa dinadala ko. Nandidiri pa nga siya sakin kasi may naka sex akong iba. 

“Ha? Bakit? Hindi naman na kayo nung may nangyari satin. Tska ang bango bango ko nga eh ang kinis ko pa, anong nakakadiri don” edi nagtawanan na naman kami, napa rant pa tuloy ako ng slight. 😅 

“Alam mo, dati nung una kami nagkakilala, tatlo kaming nakaka sex non, may schedule pa yun every week, pero ni minsan hindi ako nandiri sa kanya, ni hindi ko nga siya hinusgahan eh. Kaya ewan ko bakit ganon siya sakin. Kung maka judge kala naman niya hindi niya ginawa dati. Pero wala na kong pakelam. Pagod na ko eh, tapos na ko masaktan.”

“Hayaan mo na lang siya, wag mo na lang pansinin. Pag kailangan ng proxy sa hospital, pwede naman ako, kunwari ako yung tatay. Pag kailangan mo ng kausap at kasama ma’am, nandito lang ako.”

Nakakatuwa lang kasi hindi ko naman inexpect na magkikita ulit kami. Na magkkwentuhan kami ng napaka seryoso. Ni hindi kami nagkwentuhan about sex or any NSFW topic, as in puro random, lovelife, about work, and gym. Ang wholesome lang ng buong paguusap namin na may konting rant. Ngayon na lang ulit ako nakaranas ng ganito. Yung may nakikinig, yung kalmado, yung tumatawa lang, yung magaan. Non-stop yung kwentuhan namin. Hindi ko alam pero sobrang gumaan yung pakiramdam ko. Nakalimutan ko sandali yung mga problema ko. 

So ayun, hinatid na niya ako and nagpaalam. Sabi niya magkita daw ulit kami, pag bored ako yayain ko lang daw siya mag karaoke, kahit magsama pa daw ako ng friends ko, G lang daw siya. Ang sarap ko daw kasing kasama, ang sarap ko daw kausap. Aliw na aliw sya sa tawa ko, tapos yung mata ko daw ang ganda. Niloko ko pa siya, sabi ko siguro binobola niya lang ako para makakuha siya ng client sa gym nila haha pero sorry kako kasi hindi pa ko pwede sa ngayon 😂 

Ang saya lang nung gabi na yon. Hanggang ngayon nagme-message pa rin siya, kinakamusta ako, pinapaalala yung mga gamot ko. Pero sinabi ko naman sa kanya na hanggang mag-kaibigan lang muna kami. Yun lang talaga ang kaya kong ibigay sa kanya ngayon. Kaya sorry na agad kung hindi ‘to love story. Pero salamat sa pagbabasa hanggang dulo. Hehe 🫶🏻",4,1733318544.0,AlasFeels,4,1.0,False

I punch a clock, and get one half-hour lunch break, so that limits chances to get away from the desk. My work wouldn't allow me to use public wi-fi and I need at least two screens anyway, so coffee shops and other work spaces are out.  The main thing is that I need to be full time at one place or the other because of certain tasks that require equipment that can only be in one place.  

Taking a walk before work or at lunch sounds like a good way to break up the day, but limited as the bad weather season is upon us. I know it sounds wimpy, but I am daunted by the idea of having to make an ""outside"" life after work. After work is when I like to relax.  

Help me make the decision. I've gone back and forth for a few months now.",1,1733318139.0,workfromhome,14,0.6,False

Hi all - I have battled with my weight for my whole life.

I have during lock down used intermittent fasting effectively and lost 2 stone and this resulted in the best I had felt in my entire life.

I am not loosing myself again I’m up to 103kg - Age 32 - Height 5ft 11

I feel very uncomfortable with the way I look.

I would like to kindly ask the members of this community for some guidance for the best strategy for weight loss.

I am willing to do OMAD or 4 hour windows.

I am not sure which is best.

I will be training with a 1 to 1.5 hour walk each day and weight lifting/calesthenics 3/5 times a week. 

I have electrolytes for my water through the day and will be drinking black coffee.

Is there a WhatsApp group for this group by chance? 

I would love to hear anyone’s advice on how I should approach this and what foods to eat

From my understanding my body type is Endomorph 

I put on Muscle easily and also gain fat easily

I have done many carb free diets and absolutely thrived on them so I am happy to do low to no carb

Once again thank you for any advice 

Kind regards from myself

I will also share my weight loss results each week on this post ",0,1733317995.0,intermittentfasting,3,0.5,False

Height:184cm
Weight: 81kg
Sex: Male
It all started with a flu I had last weekend. Everything was going normally but the day my throat started hurting I was also experiencing weird chest pains that lasted couple of seconds and appeared randomly. During the night it got worse. Chest pains got more consistent and I was experiencing strong random heart palpitations. At first I just wanted to sleep because it was 4am but then I looked up on google what my symptoms meant. To my horror first thing google said was that those are heart attack symptoms. I couldn’t believe it because I know google exaggerates a lot and I’m also 21 years old. It still got to my head to the point where at 6am i went to the hospital. Ekg and medical visit basically told me my heart is fine with minor but common abnormalities caused by coffee/smoke and the palpitations were most likely caused by the viral infection I am experiencing. Fast forward two days I’m mostly fine with little to no chest pains symptoms but I still experience heart palpitations now and then. My heart beat is also weird and I don’t know if normal. I’ll add a picture of one day after. I’ll also add one weird ecg and one normal. I took these with an apple watch series 7.
Keep in mind that on that day I didn’t work out. I just walked to university. In total 5k steps. 
I just realized I can’t add pictures but if any doctor is interested in my case please dm me I’ll send them. ",1,1733317900.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

A department store CC:  $300 of a $350 credit limit (it was a $2,000 credit limit, but they recently decreased my limit, I bought couches on this card almost 6 years ago and have not used it since) (i could also pay this even now if I wanted to)

3 AM. Coffee in hand. Lines of code streaming across my screen. For weeks, this was my reality as I built RIZILA, an AI-powered platform to help job seekers create perfect CVs and motivation letters.

I was convinced I had struck gold. ""Everyone needs a good CV, right?""

Oh, how wrong I was about... well, almost everything. 😅

Here's what really happened:

1️⃣ The ""Build It and They'll Come"" Myth
I spent countless nights perfecting every pixel, making the UI seamless, testing edge cases. But while I was heads down in code, I forgot the most important thing: talking to actual users. I built what I thought people needed, without ever asking if they wanted it.

Lesson: Your perfect solution needs a validated problem.

2️⃣ The Silent Launch
Launch day arrived. I posted on Product Hunt, invested in promotions, and... crickets. 🦗
One of the paid promotions likely used bots, getting my product hidden from listings. My dreams of going viral crumbled in real-time.

Lesson: There are no shortcuts to authentic growth.

3️⃣ The Missing Audience
When I finally had something to share, I realized I had no one to share it with. No Twitter following. No LinkedIn engagement. No email list. I was shouting into the void.

Lesson: Your audience is as important as your product.

4️⃣ The ""Could Have Been"" Moment
Looking back, I realize how different things could have been if I'd built in public. Every feature could have been validated. Every decision could have had community input. Instead of launching to silence, I could have launched to an eager audience.

Lesson: Build with your community, not for them.

🎯 The Silver Lining
This isn't a story of failure – it's a story of necessary lessons. Every entrepreneur has their ""first product"" story. This is mine.

Next time will be different:
- Validate first, build later
- Build in public from day one
- Focus on community before code
- Grow organically, even if it's slower

Starting over isn't failure – it's applying yesterday's wisdom to tomorrow's dreams.

In December of 2022, u/mrtechnodad gave me the challenge of finding one good thing in everyday no matter how small. Since then I've been sharing (sorta) monthly lists of good things that have happened. 

This November I didn't plan on making one of these lists. My personal lists that I write have been getting shorter as I've gotten further back into normalcy. Part of writing this for y'all forced me to think of more things. So thank y'all for that. 

I'm preemptively writing this intro, then I'm going to add things as they happen. Next week in the United States is the holiday Thanksgiving. We all get with family and friends, eat a big meal, and feel gratitude for all we have. I think that it ties in well with the lists I make. Good things that happen can be moments you're thankful for, people you're thankful for, a yummy sandwich that you are thankful for. I think this list might be more geared towards thankfulness, rather than just Good Things™️. We'll see when I start. 

November's Good Things and Things I'm Thankful for: 
- Taking to my best friend almost every day for a week
- Technodad memes 
- The weather is cooling down
- Getting a meet and greet ticket for TommyInnit's next tour 
- My cat cuddling in bed now that it's chilly

- Seeing mountains
- Hot coffee on a cold day
- Snow!! It didn't stick but I got to watch it fall
- Starting chemo again 
- Carrot Cake 
- Seeing my sisters 
- Hot showers 
- Spending time with friends
- Making art
- Little adventures to the store 
- Playing the Horse Club Adventures 2, Secrets of Skeifa DLC
- My cat greeting me when I come home
- Fuzzy socks

This one ended up long. Writing as I go means that it sorta gets out of hand pretty quickly. I hope y'all don't mind. 

I started chemo again this month. My god is it worse than I remember. I'll be alright, I know how to deal with it. It’s just wearing me out.

Hopefully you guys can discover some new music from reading this! Also I'm a little tipsy so apologies if these reviews aren't super coherent.

Naoko Ken - Singer Naoko vs. Writer & Composer Miyuki
Definitely my favorite of all my finds. I had no idea who Naoko Ken is but these are just beautiful songs with great string arrangements that really shine on vinyl. It's very in the Kayōkyoku genre which is a kind of Japanese ballad. Fav track: Wakareuta
⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ 

Sade - Promise
As soon as I saw this I grabbed it and held on to it. I've been wanting to add some Sade into my collection and although this album was not what I was considering as my first pick I couldn't resist. This pressing is amazing and really opened my ears to Sade's music in ways I never had before. As soon as Is It a Crime? began I was already floored and once it got to the chorus I was like yes Sade sing!
⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ 1/2

Hako Yamasaki - Aruite
Originally I got this because the cover was ✨ vibes ✨ but the whole album was very good, very folky, rainy day looking out the window while a single tear falls into black coffee vibe. I would say it's not an easy album to listen to because although I have no idea what she says, her voice conveys a lot of emotion. My wife described it as the sound of someone who has been betrayed.
⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ 

Hatsumi Shibata - Best 16
Compilation album, style kind of similar to the Naoko Ken album but a little bit more campy, still has some good songs but overall not as solid. There are some more upbeat numbers as well. Fav track: Bye Bye 
⭐ ⭐ ⭐ 

Yumi Matsutoya - Benizume
Not a bad album, quite eclectic. It includes Japanese style ballads but also goes into genres like bossa nova. Unfortunately I couldn't fully enjoy it because the record was in slightly bad condition and even worse, the best song (9月には帰らない) had the most scratches. However, I would still recommend to have a glimpse into Japanese music from the 70s
⭐ ⭐ ⭐ 

Akira Wada - The Guitar
TBH I was kind of confused by this album. I got it because I was in the mood for some guitar music but these are 5 songs both repeated on different sides but one with guitar parts and one without. It seems like the part without is for people to practice playing guitar to? Anyway, the side with guitar parts was not bad, kind of spacey, sometimes a bit rocky, sometimes a bit more atmospheric. Not my favorite but an interesting listen

Guest article by Franziska Katterbach
December 4, 2024

Cannabis from the pharmacy: Since April 1, a simple prescription suffices. Photo: picture alliance / PHOTOPQR/L’ALSACE/MAXPPP | Jean-François FREY

The developments in the medical cannabis market anticipate many elements of the recreational use model originally planned by the German “traffic light” coalition. It is a system with both potential and risks. An analysis by Franziska Katterbach.

The changes introduced by the Cannabis Act or the Medical Cannabis Act regarding the prescription of medical cannabis in Germany mark a turning point. Medical cannabis will continue to be prescribed as a medicinal product under existing social law regulations. However, since April 1, a special narcotics prescription is no longer required—a regular prescription now suffices.

With the removal of the prior approval requirement by statutory health insurance providers, the threshold for doctors to prescribe cannabis has effectively been lowered. Many physicians have become more open to the subject. But what does this mean for the recreational market?

The “traffic light” coalition has implemented partial legalization, which essentially decriminalizes consumption for individuals. Cannabis can now be cultivated at home within specific limits for personal use and distributed to members of cannabis clubs (Pillar 1). However, the “Pillar 2” law, promised by Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) for regional pilot projects involving commercial supply chains, seems unlikely to materialize anytime soon given current political developments.

Yet, key components of this “second pillar” of the Cannabis Consumption Act (KCanG) have, to some extent, already become a reality—albeit under the guise of medical cannabis.

Reducing Bureaucracy and Boosting Industry

Before the Cannabis Act (CanG) took effect, doctors prescribing cannabis had to seek prior approval under Section 31(6) of the German Social Code (SGB V). This requirement created a significant administrative burden in medical practice, often with inadequate compensation. Numerous applications were initially denied, only to be approved after lengthy proceedings.

The downgrade of cannabis to a prescription medication and the removal of this hurdle have noticeably improved the situation, providing the industry with an initial boost. Online consultation platforms now offer a new, flexible approach, challenging traditional structures. Patients benefit from faster access, and prescription numbers are rising significantly.

The economic impact should not be underestimated either: According to industry reports, the medical cannabis market in Germany could grow to over one billion euros by 2028.

Medical Cannabis Market Morphing into the Recreational Market

The coalition initially aimed for full legalization—a licensed and state-controlled market for recreational cannabis. Key elements included quality control, youth protection, and regulated distribution.

In practice, however, many of these elements are already being implemented in the medical market:
	•	Controlled distribution: Cannabis products are dispensed exclusively in pharmacies, ensuring quality and safety.
	•	Youth protection: Access to cannabis is restricted to adult patients based on a doctor’s prescription.
	•	Strict regulation: All products come from certified cultivation and adhere to strict standards ensuring pharmaceutical quality and consumer safety.

The medical cannabis market has effectively also become a recreational market: Nearly anyone can obtain prescriptions through simple online consultations, which can then be redeemed at pharmacies. This enables quick access to verified products without the need to establish comprehensive new structures.

Challenges for Doctors and Patients

Despite these developments, several issues remain unresolved:
	•	Doctors’ concerns: Many physicians are hesitant to prescribe cannabis due to fears of reimbursement claims from statutory health insurers. Insurers can demand repayment from doctors if prescriptions are deemed disproportionate.
	•	Economic feasibility: Physicians are required to prescribe conventional medicines before turning to medical cannabis. Prescriptions must also be medically justified and thoroughly documented, adding to their workload.
	•	Two-tiered system: Patients purchasing cannabis privately bypass these hurdles, but this creates inequities, as not everyone can afford private prescriptions.

A Temporary Step?

Looking at Canada offers insight into how a regulated recreational market can function. In Canada, two separate systems exist: A medical market where patients obtain cannabis directly from producers following medical consultations, and a recreational market with state-controlled retail outlets.

Germany’s coalition agreement envisioned a similar model. However, pharmacies currently only dispense cannabis to “patients.” Consumers without medical indications rely on cannabis clubs, home cultivation, or the black market.

This legal framework may be only a temporary step. Some aspects of the “second pillar” are already being implemented within the medical system. These structures could easily be expanded if a political majority eventually supports a state-licensed recreational market and full legalization.

Awaiting Evaluation

The Cannabis Act mandates an evaluation process. Over four years, controlled cannabis distribution for non-medical use among adults will be assessed, with an interim report due in two years and an initial evaluation by October 1, 2025 (18 months after the law’s enactment).

This will determine whether a broader, state-regulated recreational market (with its associated European legal risks) is necessary—or whether the existing system is flexible enough to meet the needs of both patients and other cannabis consumers.

Companies should already prepare to operate in a rapidly evolving market. The cannabis industry is on the move, and those who act strategically now will benefit in the long term.

3 AM. Coffee in hand. Lines of code streaming across my screen. For weeks, this was my reality as I built RIZILA, an AI-powered platform to help job seekers create perfect CVs and motivation letters.

I was convinced I had struck gold. ""Everyone needs a good CV, right?""

Oh, how wrong I was about... well, almost everything. 😅

Here's what really happened:

1️⃣ The ""Build It and They'll Come"" Myth
I spent countless nights perfecting every pixel, making the UI seamless, testing edge cases. But while I was heads down in code, I forgot the most important thing: talking to actual users. I built what I thought people needed, without ever asking if they wanted it.

Lesson: Your perfect solution needs a validated problem.

2️⃣ The Silent Launch
Launch day arrived. I posted on Product Hunt, invested in promotions, and... crickets. 🦗
One of the paid promotions likely used bots, getting my product hidden from listings. My dreams of going viral crumbled in real-time.

Lesson: There are no shortcuts to authentic growth.

3️⃣ The Missing Audience
When I finally had something to share, I realized I had no one to share it with. No Twitter following. No LinkedIn engagement. No email list. I was shouting into the void.

Lesson: Your audience is as important as your product.

4️⃣ The ""Could Have Been"" Moment
Looking back, I realize how different things could have been if I'd built in public. Every feature could have been validated. Every decision could have had community input. Instead of launching to silence, I could have launched to an eager audience.

Lesson: Build with your community, not for them.

🎯 The Silver Lining
This isn't a story of failure – it's a story of necessary lessons. Every entrepreneur has their ""first product"" story. This is mine.

Next time will be different:
- Validate first, build later
- Build in public from day one
- Focus on community before code
- Grow organically, even if it's slower

Starting over isn't failure – it's applying yesterday's wisdom to tomorrow's dreams.

Have you had a similar experience? What was your ""I wish I knew this before"" moment in your entrepreneurial journey?

Nothing so wonderful as holding the hand of someone you love in the cool morning air (while voice-dictating with your free hand). My heart feels so light and bright.

First Mr. Maniotis’ talk with us yesterday about the responsibility of “covering” a song is still ringing in my ears. Then about 2am my phone went off and woke me up. It was June from Jammy. “What are you both doing now?” “It’s 2am! What do you think we are doing?” She told me to wake up Lolita and we should immediately listen to this song she's going to text me.

So I woke Lolita up and we [listened](https://youtu.be/c6OCOrJLYwI?si=esLseBT2xOzijoMC) to Tony Bennett singing a song called Snowfall. I called June back. “You are right! It's the most beautiful song ever! Jammy has to learn it right away.” None of the Jammy girls want us to mention them on Reddit. But June told me that she wants the world to know about this song! “Go ahead and post on your blog!”

Then on our run with the East Bronx Runners… Every Wednesday and Saturday we pass by the sanitation workers who are working our neighborhood. We wave to them, they wave to us. But today they asked us to stop. You know what they had? A whole packet of nice, cold water bottles. They said that we inspire them and they wanted to say Merry Christmas. 

Back to running and one of the ladies said, “Oh, it's holiday tip time.” Wait a second! “No, it's not about that!” Lolita said to her. “It's the Christmas spirit!”

The sun is rising and the ferry is pulling into our dock. Instead of taking the bus, we are treating ourselves to an Uber crosstown ride. That will give us time for our morning breakfast sandwich *and* a hot cup of coffee

Have you ever considered adopting a water diet plan? Many people are discovering the amazing benefits of incorporating more water into their daily routine. This simple yet powerful approach can significantly boost your health. Let’s dive into the multiple advantages of a water-focused diet.

### Promotes Hydration

Staying hydrated is crucial for overall health. Water plays a vital role in most bodily functions. It helps maintain temperature, remove waste, and lubricate joints. When you prioritize drinking water, you ensure your body operates smoothly. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses a day to keep your hydration levels in check.

### Supports Weight Loss

One of the standout benefits of a water diet plan is its potential for weight loss. When you drink water before meals, it can help you feel fuller, reducing the amount of food you consume. This simple trick can lead to lower overall calorie intake. Additionally, replacing sugary beverages with water cuts out empty calories, aiding in weight loss.

### Detoxification

Your body needs water to flush out toxins effectively. A water diet plan encourages drinking adequate amounts, which can enhance the detoxification process. When you're well-hydrated, your kidneys function better, filtering waste from the blood and regulating fluid balance. This natural detox mechanism can help you feel refreshed and revitalized.

### Quick Tips for a Successful Water Diet Plan

### Understand Your Daily Water Needs

The first step in developing a water diet plan is understanding how much water you need each day. Your personal water requirement can vary based on factors such as your age, sex, weight, and activity level. A general rule of thumb is to aim for at least 8 cups (64 ounces) of water per day. However, it’s better to calculate your needs:

- **Body weight:** Drink half your body weight (in pounds) in ounces of water. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, aim for 75 ounces a day.
- **Activity level:** Increase your intake if you exercise regularly or live in a hot climate.

### Incorporate Water-Rich Foods

In addition to drinking water, consider adding water-rich foods to your diet. Foods that are high in water content can contribute to your hydration needs. Examples include:

- Watermelon
- Cucumber
- Strawberries
- Oranges
- Celery

These foods can be delightful as snacks and can help you meet your hydration goals.

### Set a Schedule for Drinking Water

To make drinking water a habit, create a schedule. Here’s how you can do it:

- **Morning routine:** Start your day with a glass of water as soon as you wake up.
- **Before meals:** Drink a glass of water 30 minutes before each meal. This can help with digestion and may reduce your overall food intake.
- **Set reminders:** Use your smartphone or set timers to remind you to drink water throughout the day.

### Use Water to Replace Sugary Beverages

One of the most significant advantages of a water diet plan is ditching sugary drinks. These can add empty calories to your diet. Try these tips:

- **Flavor your water:** If plain water is unappealing, add slices of lemon, cucumber, or mint for a refreshing taste.
- **Transition gradually:** If you currently drink several sodas a day, start by replacing one with water each week until you’ve made a full switch.

### Track Your Progress

Monitoring your water intake can enhance accountability and help you see improvements. Here are some ways to track your progress:

- **Use a water tracking app:** There are many smartphone apps available to help you log your water consumption.
- **Keep a journal:** Write down your daily intake on paper. This traditional approach can be effective and provides insight into your habits.

### Listen to Your Body

Your body will usually send signals when it needs water. Pay attention to signs like:

- Dark urine
- Dry mouth
- Fatigue

By listening to your body, you can adjust your intake accordingly. Remember, everyone's hydration needs are different, so it’s essential to be attuned to your own.

If you have specific medical conditions or dietary restrictions, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional before starting your water diet plan. They can provide personalized guidance based on your health needs.

### Stay Committed

Adopting a water diet plan is a commitment. It requires consistency and dedication. You might not notice immediate results, but as you stick to your plan, you'll likely feel healthier and more energetic over time.

Common Myths and Misconceptions About Water Diets
-------------------------------------------------

Water diets have gained popularity over the years, but with that popularity come many myths and misconceptions. Let's dive into some of these common beliefs to clarify the truth behind water diets.

### Myth 1: You Can Survive on Water Alone

One significant misconception is that drinking only water can provide all the nutrition your body needs. While staying hydrated is essential, our bodies require a balanced diet that includes proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Relying solely on water can lead to serious health issues, including malnutrition and organ failure.

### Myth 2: Water Diets Lead to Instant Weight Loss

Many believe that cutting calories and replacing meals with water will result in rapid weight loss. While water can help in weight loss by reducing calorie intake and promoting a feeling of fullness, such weight reduction is often temporary water weight rather than fat loss. Once normal eating resumes, the weight usually comes back.

### Myth 3: All Water is Equal

Not all water is created equal. There are various types of water available, such as tap water, bottled water, and mineral water. The mineral content and purification methods vary significantly. Some promote health benefits, while others might contain impurities. It’s crucial to choose high-quality water to maximize health benefits.

### Myth 4: You Can Drink Too Much Water Without Risks

While hydration is crucial, excessive water intake can be dangerous and lead to a condition known as hyponatremia, or water intoxication. This occurs when sodium levels in the body become too diluted, causing swelling in cells, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications. It's essential to balance water intake based on your body’s needs, activity level, and climate.

### Myth 5: Water Diets are Safe for Everyone

People often assume that water diets are a safe option for everyone, but this is not the case. Certain groups, such as pregnant women, individuals with kidney problems, and those with eating disorders, may face severe health risks if they restrict their food intake and rely mainly on water. Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any drastic diet plan.

### Myth 6: You Can Drink Water Anytime, Anywhere

While it sounds reasonable to stay hydrated throughout the day, drinking excessive amounts of water during meals can dilute stomach acids, hindering digestion. Instead, consider drinking water before or after meals to optimize digestion. Listening to your body’s signals will help you maintain a healthy balance.

### Myth 7: Water Diets Detoxify Your Body

Many proponents of water diets claim that they can flush toxins from your system. However, your body is equipped with organs, such as the liver and kidneys, that naturally detoxify without the need for drastic diets. Ensuring you’re well-hydrated aids in this process, but it is not a standalone solution for detoxification.

### Myth 8: Any Hydration is Good Hydration

While staying hydrated is essential, the source and quality of your hydration matter. Sugary drinks, coffee, and sodas might contribute to your fluid intake but can carry additional calories and unhealthy substances. Opting for pure water and herbal teas is a smarter choice for optimal hydration and overall health.

### Water Diet Alternatives

If you're considering using a water diet in your routine, you might want to explore more balanced alternatives. Here are some strategies to incorporate hydration while ensuring you get the necessary nutrients:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Drink a glass of water before meals to help control appetite.
- Infuse water with fruits, herbs, or vegetables for added flavor and nutrients.
- Combine water with healthy snacks, like nuts or fruits, to maintain energy levels.
- Incorporate herbal teas and broths to diversify your hydration options.

Understanding these misconceptions can guide you towards a more balanced approach to hydration and dieting. Remember, the goal is not to restrict but to find a healthy balance that works for you. Always consult with health professionals when making significant dietary changes to ensure you're supporting your body’s needs effectively.

Hydration and Its Impact on Weight Loss
---------------------------------------

When it comes to weight loss, many people focus on diet and exercise. However, one key factor often overlooked is hydration. Drinking enough water plays a crucial role in effective weight management. Let's discover how hydration influences your weight loss journey.

### Understanding Hydration

Hydration refers to the process of providing adequate water to your body. About 60% of your body is made up of water, which is essential for various bodily functions, including digestion, circulation, and temperature regulation. Understanding the importance of hydration is the first step toward harnessing its benefits for weight loss.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Water Intake and Metabolism

Your metabolism, which is the process by which your body converts food into energy, can be significantly affected by hydration levels. When you're adequately hydrated, your metabolic rate can increase. Research has shown that drinking about 500 ml of water can boost your metabolism by approximately 30% for about 30 to 40 minutes. Here’s how water impacts your metabolism:

- **Enhances Caloric Burning:** Drinking cold water forces your body to expend energy to reach normal body temperature, although the amount is minimal.
- **Improves Digestion:** Water helps dissolve fats and soluble fiber, allowing for easier digestion and nutrient absorption.
- **Regulates Appetite:** Staying hydrated helps prevent unnecessary snacking by keeping your stomach full.

### Water and Appetite Control

One of the most interesting benefits of water when trying to lose weight is its ability to control appetite. Sometimes, when you think you're hungry, your body might just be thirsty. Drinking a glass of water before meals can help you eat less. Studies suggest that people who drink water before their meals consume fewer calories. Here are some quick tips:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Drink a glass of water 30 minutes before eating.
- Keep a water bottle handy throughout the day to remind yourself to drink.
- If you're feeling hungry, drink water first and see if the craving subsides.

### Water Intake Recommendations

How much water should you drink for optimal hydration? While the ""8 glasses a day"" rule is common advice, hydration needs vary based on factors such as age, weight, activity level, and climate. Here are some general guidelines:

- **Women:** Aim for about 2.7 liters (91 ounces) of total water daily, including all beverages and food.
- **Men:** Aim for about 3.7 liters (125 ounces) daily.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Your thirst is a natural indicator of hydration needs. Additionally, observe the color of your urine; pale yellow indicates adequate hydration.

### Hydration During Exercise

When you exercise, your body loses water through sweat, which can lead to dehydration if not replenished. Staying hydrated during workouts helps maintain performance and energy levels. A few suggestions include:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Drink water before, during, and after exercising to stay hydrated.
- Consider electrolyte drinks if you engage in prolonged, intense exercise.
- Keep track of your fluid intake to ensure you are meeting your body's needs.

### Hydration Sources Beyond Water

While drinking plain water is important, you can also stay hydrated through various foods and beverages. Here are some options:

- **Fruits:** Watermelon, oranges, and strawberries are high in water content.
- **Vegetables:** Cucumbers, lettuce, and celery are also excellent choices.
- **Herbal Teas:** These can count toward your daily water intake without added calories.

Hydration is a vital component in the weight loss process. Not only does it play a crucial role in your metabolism, but it also aids in appetite control and exercise performance. By ensuring you drink enough water and incorporating hydrating foods into your diet, you can enhance your weight loss efforts significantly. Remember to listen to your body and prioritize hydration daily for optimal health and wellness.

# MORE about - China restricting exports of critical minerals to US in response to chip restrictions

***Beijing halts supply of gallium, germanium, and antimony over dual-use concerns***

[China restricts exports of critical minerals to US in response to chip restrictions](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/china-restricts-exports-of-critical-minerals-to-us-in-response-to-chip-restrictions/3412793)

https://preview.redd.it/pucnibgsmt4e1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7878cf9f31230095dca55d56cd7eb30ecb42ab5

**BEIJING**

China has announced export restrictions on critical minerals to the United States, countering recent US measures targeting its chip industry.

The Ministry of Commerce stated that the export of materials with dual military and civilian uses, including gallium, germanium, antimony, and super-hard materials, to US defense manufacturers is now prohibited.

Exports of graphite, which is essential for batteries and aerospace applications, will also face tight controls.

China justified the measures as compliant with its export control laws, asserting that they aim to safeguard national security and uphold international non-proliferation obligations.

As the world’s largest producer of rare metals—accounting for 70% of global output and processing 85%—China’s move could significantly disrupt supply chains.

A US Geological Survey (USGS) report warned that restricting gallium and germanium exports could cost the US economy $3.4 billion.

The Chinese government had already announced in August 2023 that gallium and germanium exports would be restricted, followed by graphite export controls in December.

**Response to chip restrictions**

China’s action is a direct response to US restrictions targeting its chip-making industry.

The US Commerce Department recently expanded its export controls, prohibiting the sale of 24 types of chip-manufacturing equipment and three categories of software essential for semiconductor production.

US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo stated that the measures aim to curb China’s military advancements in cutting-edge technologies.

Beijing has condemned the US actions, accusing Washington of using export controls to suppress Chinese industries.

The Joe Biden administration has prioritized preventing the transfer of critical technologies to China, notably through the CHIPS and Science Act and broader investment restrictions.

Signed into law in August 2022, the CHIPS and Science Act has limited Chinese manufacturers’ access to advanced semiconductor technologies.

In August 2023, Biden issued an executive order restricting American companies from investing in critical technology sectors in China, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and microelectronics.



# DEC. 3RD, 2024~ China’s Trade Reprisals May Extend to Minerals Like Rare Earths

China isn’t short of options when it comes to critical minerals that could be used as counters in a trade war with the US.

Beijing’s ban on Tuesday covering sales to the US of gallium, germanium, antimony and superhard materials, and tighter controls on graphite, are likely an opening salvo in export controls that could be extended to dozens of niche materials if trade frictions with Washington escalate.

“This may only be the start of the country ensuring national security and its strategic role in mineral resources,” Citic Securities Co. said in a note.

The state-backed brokerage listed 10 commodities, including the 17 elements grouped as rare earths, in which China holds an outsized role as producer or processor. The minerals are typically crucial to high-tech manufacturing, including so-called dual uses in military applications. 

Beijing’s latest restrictions were imposed after the White House on Monday slapped fresh curbs on the sale to China of high-end memory chips made by US and foreign companies. The Biden administration is using targeted measures to slow the country’s development of advanced semiconductors and artificial intelligence systems that may help its military. 

President-elect Donald Trump, however, has threatened import tariffs as high as 60% on all Chinese goods, a measure that would invite a heavy response from Beijing. 

* Beijing is reminding Washington—including the incoming Trump administration—that it has a new arrow in its quiver, said Bloomberg Economics. We expect a second US-China trade war in Donald Trump’s second term. One key difference could be that Beijing escalates by using export controls in response to US tariffs.

As well as rare earths, Citic’s list includes tungsten, molybdenum, titanium, tin, indium, chromium, tantalum, niobium and cesium as candidates for export curbs. China also enjoys dominance in other commodities such as arsenic, which has a wide range of applications from herbicides to telecommunications. In recent years, the US has relied on China for 60% of its supply of the metal, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

Rare earths, meanwhile, have been a feature of China’s previous trade disputes, and last year the government halted the export of a range of technologies associated with processing the elements, making it harder for the US and its allies to bolster supplies of the strategic raw materials. 

In the wake of Beijing’s ban, investors rushed into companies that mine and refine critical minerals. In China, Yunnan Lincang Xinyuan Germanium Industrial Co. surged by 10%, the daily limit, while Yunnan Chihong Zinc & Germanium Co. rose as much as 7.8%. 

In Sydney, Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. advanced as much as 5.6%. The company last month opened the largest processing facility for the elements outside China.

The problem for Beijing is that further curbs on strategic minerals will only hasten efforts by the US and its allies to counter its dominance, which will dilute their impact.  

For example, when China first tightened export controls on germanium and gallium in 2023, it would have signaled to buyers they needed to diversify supply. As a result, Chinese customs data showed zero exports of the two minerals to the US this year, which suggests that firms were instead tapping inventories or procuring the metal from other sources. 

On the Wire

China could approve another 100 nuclear reactors over the coming decade, according to an industry lobby group, as the nation turns itself into the world’s biggest operator of atomic power and potentially a major exporter of the technology.

Mitsubishi Corp. has suffered a loss of more than $90 million in China after uncovering suspected fraud by one of its copper traders, according to people familiar with the matter.

China’s move to ban exports of rare metals to the US underscores the need for trade cooperation between mineral-rich Canada and its southern neighbor.

Teck Resources says it’s considering ways to lift germanium output following China’s move to ban shipments of the rare metal to the US.

The leaders of Wyoming’s budding rare earth mining startups were feeling vindicated Tuesday after China announced a ban on exporting several critical minerals to the United States.

The Chinese ban announced Tuesday includes gallium, used to make semiconductors, and germanium, used for infrared and fiber optics technology. China also banned antimony, used for military explosives, and super hard materials like tungsten, used for armor-piercing bullets and shells.

China’s move followed the Biden administration further cutting off access to advanced American technology, adding 100 Chinese companies to a restricted trade list in an escalating tech war between the two superpowers.

“This kind of validates the momentum that is already going here in Wyoming,” Wyoming Rare (USA) President Joe Evers said. “And it also shows that domestic projects like those that are being undertaken in the state of Wyoming are so necessary and important for our economic prosperity and our national defense.”

Wyoming has a huge head start on other American states in developing rare earths mines and processing, Evers added, and its position at the front can only be a benefit in what is definitely becoming something of a rare earths arms race.

“Most folks take it for granted,” he said. “When you think about these resources, critical minerals and rare earths, they’re in our pockets, in our computers, and in our homes.

“It’s in our cars — whatever they might be. But I don’t think we appreciate how much lead time is necessary to bring these projects online.”

# Already Working

Wyoming also doesn’t have all its rare earth eggs in one basket. It has several projects already in the works.

The Halleck Creek project near Wheatland, for example, that Evers’ company is working to bring online, has the potential to be one of the [largest rare earth deposits](https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/12/23/wyoming-rare-earths-deposit-has-potential-to-be-worlds-richest/) in the nation, if not the world. The U.S. government has already pledged [up to $456 million in financing](https://cowboystatedaily.com/2024/09/27/huge-wyoming-rare-earth-project-gets-450-million-loan-from-feds/) for the project.

Final assay results from the most recent core samples taken from the area have confirmed some of the highest-grade rare earth oxides to date at the location as it works to flesh out the business case for its mine, according to recent announcements by the company.

Concurrent with that effort, the company has continued to make “good progress” on the permitting side of things, Evers added.

“We’re getting everything teed up for additional exploration next spring and summer,” he said. “And we’re really focusing in on the metallurgical process of how we get metal out of these rocks that we’re working on out there.”

Then there is also Ramaco Resources, which has an unconventional rare earth deposit estimated to be worth at least[ $37 billion](https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/11/26/37-billion-rare-earths-bonanza-may-only-be-the-beginning-for-wyoming-coal-mine/). 

Since then, the company has [revised its estimates](https://cowboystatedaily.com/2024/03/26/one-of-worlds-richest-rare-earth-deposits-in-wyoming-may-be-richer/) upward, from 800,000 tons of rare earths to more like 1.5 million tons.

While the Halleck Creek deposit doesn’t have any of the listed banned materials, Ramaco’s deposits include both gallium and germanium, both of which are among the more valuable rare earths.

# Wyoming Head Of The Pack

But it’s not just these rich rare earth mining sites that are putting Wyoming ahead of the game. There are also efforts to develop an entirely new, and cheaper, approach to the chemistry of refining rare earth minerals. 

That’s where the [recently finished](https://cowboystatedaily.com/2024/11/02/uptons-china-busting-rare-earths-demonstration-plant-is-officially-underway/) demonstration plant in Upton comes in. It, too, has received federal assistance for its mission to scale up an economically feasible approach to processing rare earths.

That’s been seen as critical to developing a domestic supply, more so even than the mining itself. China has long maintained a stranglehold on rare earth supplies by flooding the market with the minerals, choking out competitors by keeping prices so low, they can’t compete.

Rare Element Resources Vice President, General Counsel, and Chief Administrative Officer Kelli Kast told Cowboy State Daily her company views China’s latest announcement as a call to action for domestic sources and technology. And she’s excited to be part of helping to lead that charge here in Wyoming.

“It once again shows China’s intention to manipulate the market by putting export restrictions on key critical rare minerals,” she said in an email. “Because Rare Element Resource’s rare earth Bear Lodge deposit near Sundance and our proprietary processing and separation technology is wholly separate from Chinese sourcing and technology, we believe our demonstration project now underway in Upton is even more important, and then the development of our Bear Lodge Mine.”

***Given its proximity to the world-class Bear Lodge deposit, the town could one day be in line for a full-scale operations plant, if American Rare Earths’ process is proven out.***

# DEC. 3RD, 2024~ Strengthening Canada-U.S. Critical Mineral Partnership Amid Rising Geopolitical Tensions

OTTAWA, ON, Dec. 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - China's recent decision to ban exports of gallium, germanium, antimony, and other high-tech materials with potential military applications in retaliation for U.S. restrictions on semiconductor-related exports, underscores the precariousness of global supply chains. This development highlights the vital role of the Canada-U.S. trade relationship in addressing supply chain vulnerabilities.

China's actions serve as a stark reminder of the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions, particularly on the reliable supply of critical minerals. These materials are essential not only for technological innovation and economic growth but also for defense applications critical to national security.

Canada has long been a dependable partner, providing certainty to U.S. manufacturing and defense industries by serving as a major supplier of minerals and metals. In 2022, 52% of Canada's mineral exports—valued at over $80 billion—were destined for the U.S.. Strengthening the free flow of minerals and metals between Canada and the U.S. is more critical than ever.

Imposing tariffs on Canadian mineral and metal exports to the U.S. would run counter to the shared goals of secure and reliable supply chains. Such measures risk disrupting the essential flow of these resources, undermining the competitiveness of North American industries, and exacerbating vulnerabilities in critical mineral supply chains that both nations are working to address.

The partnership on critical minerals between Canada and the U.S. began in earnest with the development of the [Joint Action Plan on Critical Minerals Collaboration](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4316856-1&h=362338770&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fnatural-resources-canada%2Fnews%2F2020%2F01%2Fcanada-and-us-finalize-joint-action-plan-on-critical-minerals-collaboration.html&a=Joint+Action+Plan+on+Critical+Minerals+Collaboration) in 2020 under President Trump. This collaboration has continued under the Biden administration, demonstrating the enduring importance of this strategic alliance. As the U.S. prepares for a new administration, we look forward to working closely with the incoming Trump administration to build on this foundation, ensuring the resilience of critical mineral supply chains and supporting shared economic and defense priorities.

""The minerals and metals industry in Canada stands ready to strengthen our partnership with the United States, ensuring the free flow of these essential resources that drive economic growth, defense capabilities, and technological advancement on both sides of the border.  The security and well-being of all Canadians and Americans depends on it."" said Pierre Gratton, President and CEO of MAC.

*The mining industry is a major sector of Canada's economy, contributing $161 billion to the national GDP and is responsible for 21 percent of Canada's total domestic exports. Canada's mining sector employs 694,000 people directly and indirectly across the country. The industry is proportionally the largest private sector employer of Indigenous peoples in Canada and a major customer of Indigenous-owned businesses.*
