1h9cgiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1h9cgiw/is_breville_espresso_machine_worth_it/,Is Breville espresso machine worth it?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts!

I've been a home barista for about 7 years now, and I want to share my honest experience with Breville espresso machines. After trying various brands and models, I finally invested in a Breville, and let me tell you - it's been a game-changer for my morning routine.

First off, let's talk about what you're actually getting for your money. These machines aren't just fancy coffee makers; they're legitimate espresso machines that can pull shots comparable to what you'd get at your local coffee shop. The pressure gauge, precise temperature control, and built-in grinder (in most models) make a huge difference in the quality of espresso you can make at home.

What really sold me was the user-friendly interface. Unlike some Italian machines that feel like you need an engineering degree to operate, Breville makes the whole process intuitive. The machines basically hold your hand through the learning curve of espresso making.

The build quality is solid too. I've had mine for three years now, and it's still running like day one. Sure, it's not the tank-like construction of commercial machines, but for home use, it's more than adequate. The stainless steel finish not only looks sleek but also matches most kitchen aesthetics.

One thing that surprised me was how much money I've saved. Think about it - a decent cappuccino costs around $5 nowadays. If you're having one daily, that's $150 per month! My Breville paid for itself in less than a year.

But let's be real - these machines aren't perfect. The built-in grinder, while convenient, isn't as precise as standalone professional grinders. And yes, they're not cheap. However, when you compare them to other prosumer machines, Breville offers excellent value for the features you get.

If you're thinking about getting one, I'd recommend checking out the current prices and models here: https://athometouch.com/breville

Maintenance is pretty straightforward too. Regular cleaning and descaling will keep it running smoothly. The machine even tells you when it needs attention, which is super helpful.

I've noticed that my coffee game has improved significantly since getting my Breville. I can now experiment with different beans and dial in the perfect shot, something I couldn't do with my old machine. The consistency in shot quality is what really makes it worth it for me.

For anyone on the fence about investing in a Breville espresso machine, I'd say go for it if you're serious about good coffee and want to develop your barista skills. The learning curve isn't too steep, the results are fantastic, and the machine will last you years with proper care.

Just remember - even the best machine needs good beans and some practice to make great coffee. But with a Breville, you've got all the tools you need to make cafe-quality drinks at home.

Has anyone else here made the switch to Breville? I'd love to hear about your experiences!",1,1733638095.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False
1h9cghf,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1h9cghf/signs_he_is_interested/,Signs he is interested ,"He was a manager and I worked with him but he not my direct boss though higher up the chain than me. 

We first started texting and during summer did so almost daily. Sometimes it was about work and other times it was about our life outside of it. Sometimes we would share pics of things. It did seem to change a little when I said something about being just friends and then he said it too

At work I tried to keep things professional and I’m shy so it’s easier for me to talk in text and he was so focused and busy with other coworkers so I didn’t want to interfere. At one point he did invite me to eat lunch with him in his office which I did, but it was more like a work lunch as people came to stop by to ask him questions. As a friend and courtesy I would get him coffee once a month or so. During the lunch the convo went to hands momentarily when he asked me to reach out and compare his and so we ended up touching (it was part of a random convo)

People started kind of gossiping and speculating that I like him (and maybe him liking me I’m not sure) after that he backed way off like cut ties with me, like don’t talk and our boss heard about it. In fact he sort of made a complaint about me. But sometimes like we had a work meeting and I sat by myself and by the end he was standing near me. If I went down a hall to avoid him he would pursue/go down the same hall as me. Sometimes he would wait and hold the door for me(I realize this is common courtesy but it starts to maybe add up) During this time once he even playfully pretended to scare me and grab me from behind on my shoulders. 

A couple of other times he was talking with people and I was coming down the stairs and they were facing him but turned to look at me as if he was looking or had some expression that caused them to look. A couple of times I had a skirt and it wasn’t too short but as he walked by as I was with another female coworker it seemed he couldn’t help but look (as if he was checking me out) someone had apparently asked him if he was into me and he denied it completely. I always get compliments from staff on how I look and dress. However if I’m extra dressy and feel I look extra good looking it’s like he will ignore/not look at me. 

We would talk about hanging outside of work to get coffee or drinks etc and he/we both agreed and said yes, but sometimes he would have other things and just seemed nervous to. 

I had told him several times before I felt confused with our relationship because he was like a boss but also a friend and sometimes I didn’t know how to address him and the boundaries of things. I had also told him I would not want to date someone I work with because of possible drama and how it would be if we broke up but still having to see the person at work. One time we had a whole “argument “ because there was an issue I had at work and I talked about going to the higher ups and I didn’t want to involve him because I felt we were too close and it Would be awkward and I was going to tell him but then I didn’t but he kept pressing me saying he was going to be stressed and worried about it as it sounded concerning 

Well he recently left and js at a new facility with the same company but now it may be different because he is not a manager and we aren’t coworkers. We slowly have started talking again but not as much of same as before

I (34F) have been in a relationship with my husband (34M) for a total of 9 years (married for 5) and our relationship is at a breaking point and we’re on the brink of divorce. I’ve recently started to suspect that my husband could have some degree of OCPD (I recently learned about this from my therapist). The past year or so has been very rocky with conflicts happening once every few days, sometimes every day. Something about our relationship has always felt somewhat off or unfair to me, but I could never quite put my finger on what it was. My husband is a great person and has qualities of a great partner - very emotionally attuned, loving, caring, and considerate. We had hopeful plans for the future: starting a business and eventually starting a family. However, we haven’t yet been able to pursue those plans because for years we’ve always been fixated on working on another project: our relationship (but particularly me). For background, I was a recovering alcoholic (still drinking off and on during the first year, but finally quit for good shortly after our 1st anniversary and have been sober ever since).

My husband is very particular and detail-oriented. He's particular and critical about other daily life aspects as well, such as making coffee, the way the dishwasher is loaded, and constantly ""optimizing"" various daily processes. Also, he tends to be quite judgmental if people are not doing things or behaving in a way that he views as the “right way.” He often is critical about the way others act, including my family and his own friends and family. He cut off his parents a few years ago and also cut out a couple of friendships because he did not approve of the way they were treating him (some of which I can understand). He’s told me he has felt like he has experienced some “OCD-like” tendencies, but mostly when he was younger and doesn’t feel that way much anymore.

Since we first got together, he’s given me an abundance of feedback/criticism over the years. I knew I had my issues being recently sober, trying to acclimate to my new identity as a non-drinker. I just didn’t realize how many issues I had but became acutely aware according to all the feedback he had given me. Recently, I actually sat down and listed all of the things I could think of that’s he’s given me feedback about and I easily came up with over a hundred distinct items. He’s criticized things as basic as the way I walk, talk, and my facial expressions, the way I do my hair, to the way I express myself and how I interact with others (friends, family, strangers), often saying I’m not assertive enough/too timid, don’t speak enough, share my opinion enough, etc.

To be clear, I know that I have my interpersonal issues and I struggle in intimate relationships as far as displaying enough physical affection, intimacy, and being vulnerable. I realize that I have an insecure/avoidant attachment style which can be problematic and we are definitely mismatched compatibility-wise. He’s told me that I need to learn to speak his love languages, particularly with affection and intimacy. This is something I’ve been trying to learn and get better at over the years, but I struggle greatly, and I believe it’s at least partially because I don’t feel emotionally safe with him. Whenever I try to touch him/show him affection in some way, it is scrutinized and I’m told that I didn’t do it the right way or the way I’m doing it doesn’t resonate with him. He tells me that when I make attempts I come off as too unsure of myself and he finds that completely unappealing. He says I lack expressiveness and that the way I show love is insufficient and doesn't meet his needs, often citing that he doesn’t feel much emotional connection with me. He’s told me I need to be more expressive, more feminine, etc. I’ve made honest attempts to be more of the way he’s seeking, but it is never good enough. There is always some form of criticism or “feedback.” There’ve been instances in which I’ve complimented him and he thanked me for the compliment but said that the way I said it wasn’t expressive enough and didn’t resonate with him at all. He’s also told me I have a huge problem with communication and that I often under-communicate or communicate in a way that leads to misunderstandings. I’ve improved in this area as well but he is very critical if I make a communication mistake because he’s been “through so much with me.”

Over the past year or so, he’s particularly fixated on the way I speak, citing that I’m too monotone or my voice lacks energy and inflections. I’ve actually made great strides in improving this aspect, but he is still extremely critical and impatient if I sound “flat” or “hit a bad note.” He gets so bothered by this he often shuts down and goes silent and then he expects me to validate and comfort him to make him feel better. I often try to do this, but I’m unable to bring him comfort because he says I didn’t say the right things, in the right way, or touch him in the right way while I’m comforting him. There are often times where I feel like I make “mistakes” that I don’t agree are mistakes so I share my perspective on it but he says that my perception is skewed and that what he is telling me to improve is “objectively right.” My perspective is not heard out because I’m viewed as the “instigator” of all of our issues because I lack “basic/fundamental” things therefore I should yield to him. He tells me he is not interested in my perspective because I’m the one who made an initial mistake.

He says he has no patience with me because I’ve deprived him for years of a healthy, emotional, intimate connection, which he desperately needs. I understand that he truly feels this way and that is valid, however, I’ve been questioning for years whether this level and frequency of criticism I receive is warranted. I wonder if it is to this level because he might be viewing things through the lens of OCPD (that is if he has it).

Over the past couple of years, the criticism has been unbearable and I have felt a dramatic shift in my self-esteem and emotional stability. I often feel completely unlovable, like I’m defective (he’s told me that if he would've realized how broken I was he probably wouldn’t have gotten in a relationship with me in the first place). Through the years I feel as though I gave my best effort but with the constant criticism about the way I am and the scrutiny of all of my attempts at meeting his needs, I just can’t continue to carry on in this relationship with the way I feel broken down emotionally. He’s gotten to the point where he is so frustrated he calls me some things that are very damaging and hurtful, often calling me stupid or an idiot if I don’t agree with him because “I can’t understand basic logic.” I’ve tried explaining to him that when he says these things it is just hurting the relationship but he says that it’s inhumane for me to deny him of expressing himself and that it is the “right” thing to do because I’ve caused him so much pain over the years. Recently during an argument, he told me that I’ve been a terrible partner and this relationship has been horrible for him since the beginning.

I honestly feel like I’m leaving so much detail out, but there is so much feedback/criticism that I’ve received that I feel it will be too long to cover. The biggest thing that is making me feel like I can’t go on is that he refuses to see things from my perspective and I am constantly blamed for the demise of the relationship. I’ve tried explaining things to him many times in many ways to try to have him see the role he is playing in contributing negatively to the dynamics, but nothing ever seems to get through and he refuses to take any responsibility. I’m really just looking for some insight from anyone who has possibly experienced something similar because I’ve been so lost for so long. I feel like there is something off with him at times, but then I start to doubt myself and think all of the problems lie with me. I’m doubting myself now even as I’m writing this. Could this be OCPD or are we just in a terribly unhealthy dynamic?

We currently aren't speaking to each other after another fight about a perceived ""mistake"" I made. I don't believe it was a mistake, but I validated him while also giving my perspective. That wasn't acceptable to him because ""after all we've been through with my poor communication,"" I should not provide my perspective and should only be apologizing/validating. We argued back and forth for a couple of days, couldn't see eye to eye, and essentially haven't been speaking now for 2 weeks. I've attempted to extend an olive branch on 2-3 occasions, but was denied and he still refuses to speak to me. 

**TLDR**: I've been in a relationship with my husband for 9 years, and we're on the brink of divorce. I suspect he might have OCPD, which has made him very critical of me. He's given me constant feedback on everything from my behavior to my communication, making me feel inadequate and emotionally unsafe. Despite my efforts to improve, he never seems satisfied and refuses to see things from my perspective. His criticism has severely impacted my self-esteem, and I'm questioning whether the issues are due to his potential OCPD or if we're just in an unhealthy dynamic. I'm seeking insight from others who might have experienced something similar.

I need to use devices with unsecure public WiFI, for two reasons: 1) to access resources at home/office, and 2) to encrypt my Internet traffic from the coffee shop hotspots.

The home ISP is under CGNAT with inflexible ISP-provided gateways. Technically, the computers inside are triple-NAT'ed. The home ISP also has slow upload speed, which translates to slow download speed if a home computer is used as exit nodes.

Solution:

1. Install talescale on a cheap VPS server as an exit node.
2. Install talescale on a home server as a subnet router.
3. Install talescale on my laptop and phone.
4. Apply ACL so that traffic can only flow from 3) to 1) and 2).  Flows in other directions are not allowed. For example, there can be no flow from 1) or 2) to 3), and there can be no flow between 1) and 2).
5. The VPS server may have vulnerabilities and may be compromised. (So theoretically someone can monitor my unencrypted traffic terminating on that server, but it's probably still better than coffee shop.)

The advantage is that I will be able to remote into my home office while enjoy fast encrypted Internet. But how secure is this solution? Do you guys see any holes in this scheme that will allow an attacker to invade my laptop, phone, or home network?",1,1733636477.0,Tailscale,0,1.0,False

Over the years I've noticed a pattern in the activity. Babies. When all of my kids were babies they would look at the ceiling and smile and coo. My son was upstairs in his bedroom when he was around 1.5-2 in his crib. I had the baby monitor on and was doing dishes from dinner. I head my son talking. ""Hi, hi, hi.""  Random babbles I couldn't make out.. Then I clearly heard a man's voice say, "" bye buddy."" Then heard my son say, ""bah-bye!"" I ran upstairs to his room as fast as I could because there was no man in the house. My mom also heard the man's voice. I searched the whole upstairs top to bottom and nothing! I asked my son and he just said man. Not entirely odd as my mom told me I learned patty cake without her teaching me. 
I've also noticed activity when the ghosts don't like what you're doing. In January 2004 I turned 13. To celebrate I had a sleepover with 3 friends. We went to the video store and rented the blair witch project on VHS. This was 2 days into 2004 so we thought it was real. We built a giant bed on the floor with tons of pillows and blankets, turned the TV channel to 3 and popped the Vhs into the player. Anyone old enough to remember Vhs tapes will likely remember you needed the TV on channel 3 or 4 as your ""output"" to see and hear the movie. We turned off the lights and and cuddled up. As the movie started to get to the more intense scenes where you knew something was about to happen all of a sudden the TV started scrolling through channels 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. As the static channels filled the screen, it also very loudly filled our ears. We all jumped and screamed. Then we laughed as we searched all around us for the remote as someone had to be laying on it. I flipped on my bedroom light and we all sat up and dug through the pillows and blankets. We couldn't find it. We all stood up so we could shake the blankets out and to our horror the remote was sitting in the middle of my bed no where near the 4 of us. Freaked out I grabbed it and muted the TV to get the static noise to stop. As we tried to gather our thoughts acrossed the room a box flew off my keyboard(piano) bouncing off my windows and flying back to the the middle of the room. No one was near it. We screamed and ran downstairs to have my older brother and his girlfriend  ""comfort""(laugh at) us.
The last pattern I've noticed became clear last winter. I've always been able to read people very well. When I meet someone I can tell by their eyes if they're a good or bad person. I get a sense of a color and pictures in my brain. I don't know how to explain it. I can just tell what someone is truly like by looking in their eyes. My son met this new kid at wrestling. He acted like a really nice funny guy. But I could just feel something dark there..like dark bad. Red fire, snake green, diabolical. But he acted so nice. My son asked if he could spend the night to go to a tournament the next Saturday. I told him I was apprehensive. But this boys parents called me and we talked. The father worked at the school a few towns over, they were stricter parents. He knew he was to remain respectful and polite, etc. After talking to the parents for a half hour I said I was ok with the sleepover. Friday night comes around and I had my best friend over for a sleepover painting night. The boys invited over a few other neighbor boys and played fortnite. After a while my best friend and I were laying in my bed laughing and joking around when all of a sudden the led rope lights that line my room started changing settings. Warm white, neutral white, cool white, bright white. Then the brightness turned all the way down to low, then all the way up to high and turned off! I was upset thinking my son was pranking me so I went downstairs to question him for taking the remote for my lights. He was adamant he did not have it. I had him open the app he uses for his lights to confirm he hadn't found a way to add mine on there. He hadn't. My lights don't work on a app. My best friend and I headed back upstairs and we saw my light remote hanging off my lamp where it always is. I didn't bother checking to see if it was there before asking my son. I turned the lights back on and we brushed it off as maybe I got a faulty set and went to bed. 
The next day on our way to the tournament the boys told me what happened to them the night before. My son and his two normal neighbor friends were in his room playing the Xbox. The new kid went to the bathroom acrossed the house. He said as he peed someone was jiggling he door knob. He said he was almost done but the jiggling persisted along with knocking on the door. He quickly turned and unlocked the door and swung it open and no one was anywhere. He ran back to my son's room all freaked out and the guys asked what happened and he told them one of them must've been pulling a prank. Our house is over 100 years old. It's creaky. You would clearly hear someone walking away let alone running away. 
Later that night they asked if he could spend the night again due to a family emergency. I work Sundays but felt bad for the kid so I allowed it.. I had my old long term man friend over that night. He would spend the night Saturdays so we could carpool on Sunday. My little kids are with their father Saturday nights so it's usually only my oldest son home. 
My man friend and I were sleeping when I woke up to my door knob jiggling. I got up and unlocked my door thinking my son needed something. To my surprise no one was there. Even more odd you hear every footstep upstairs and I heard no one walking away. I did notice my younger children's bedroom door was open and I know it was closed. I shut my door and their door and went downstairs to ask my son if he needed something. I walked through my kitchen just as my son opened the front door coming in. They were having a little fire at the neighbors house with his father. He was not home. No one was. I told him what happened and him being the 6ft 1in buff wrestler he said he was going to look around. He went and got his pellet gun and quickly loaded it. I told him it was fine and I would just go back to bed. He walked with me to the stairs only to see the blue led lights shining through upstairs indicating my younger boys bedroom door was open again. Again it's an old house. Had my man friend been out of bed I would have heard the footsteps. I would've heard the bedroom doors opening and closing. You hear everything up there whether you're upstairs or downstairs. My son insisted at that point to check it out. He checked my small bathroom and it was clear, the boys room and it was clear. I opened my room and quickly looked and nothing. My guy friend hadn't even moved a finger since I had been gone. My son went downstairs and went to bed. I went back to bed. 
In the morning I went downstairs to start making coffee. I heard my man friend walking upstairs, I heard him say something then start walking downstairs. As he walked past the kitchen he did a double take and said I swear I just saw you in the bathroom mirror reflection as I walked past. I thought it was weird you didn't have the light on but I saw someone in there. We ran to look and nothing or nobody anywhere. 
We went to work, the new kids parents picked him up, and the new kid has never been back(good thing as we found out he really is trouble), the activity in my house stopped and almost a year later my lights in my room have been perfectly fine. 
That's when I came to the conclusion the ghosts are always active when their is a baby in the house to play with, when you're doing something they don't like, or someone is in the house they don't like. My mom told me numerous stories when she was younger and the ghosts were active when she had certain people over who ended up being bad people. So sorry, not sorry, my ghosts don't like you.",1,1733636250.0,spoopycjades,0,1.0,False

1h9byvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/1h9byvq/he_doesnt_want_to_go_to_dinner_to_meet_my_family/,He doesn’t want to go to dinner to meet my family because he can’t afford it. ,"I’m the girlfriend asking. My boyfriend and I currently have a bump in our finances where we currently could only afford home cooking vs going out to eat (considered a luxury purchase atm) . My cousins are coming to town and they invited my boyfriend and I to an upscale dinner.

Cousins do not know our financial situation and would rather keep that business private. 

Bf feels guilty not being able to afford everyone’s meals even if we agreed to split it. If cousins would cover the cost of dinner, he still feels guilty or embarrassed. If I offered to pay or Zelle him the $ before dinner, he still feels guilty. It’s the social expectation of a man being able to afford dinners or experiences for their partner is what has him he feeling guilty and not being able to offer this experience. 

Ofc it would mean a lot for me for him to go and for him to meet other members of my family for the first time (this will be his first time meeting a second member of my fam) esp since I’ve met many members of his. We’ve been together over a year. We love and care about each other and I believe we can overcome this bump.  

I assume he wants to give a good impression to my family, but because of his finances, he is choosing not to go to avoid the situation. 

I have offered to do an alternative double date like walking around the park with coffee (or without) that I can pay for my boyfriend and I. He says I’m pushing it and manipulating my way at this point… 😒

Appreciate your thoughts and insights. 

TLDR: my boyfriend can’t afford to go to dinner to meet my cousins who are coming from out of town. I’ve offered other options that we can do together. He says no. He is choosing not to go to avoid further embarrassment. ",5,1733636200.0,AskMenOver30,7,0.78,False
1h9byjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalWizards/comments/1h9byjs/how_to_build_authentic_customer_relationships/,How to Build Authentic Customer Relationships Through Digital Marketing,"Building authentic customer relationships isn’t about flashy campaigns or sales pitches; it’s about making customers feel seen, heard, and valued. Here’s how brands are doing it effectively:

1️⃣ **Personalized Communication**  
Creating tailored experiences based on customer preferences is key.

*Example:* A loyal customer of a bookstore receives an email suggesting books based on their purchase history. The email includes a note: “Since you enjoyed *The Midnight Library*, we thought you’d love *Before We Were Strangers*. Plus, enjoy 15% off your next purchase!” The personal touch makes the customer feel valued.

2️⃣ **Active Social Media Engagement**  
It’s not just about posting content but engaging directly with customers.

*Example:* A customer tweets about their new headphones, mentioning how amazing the sound quality is. The brand replies, “We’re so glad you’re enjoying them! Got a favorite playlist to test them out further? 🎶” This simple acknowledgment sparks a positive interaction and strengthens the connection.

3️⃣ **Transparency and Trust**  
Being open about practices and decisions builds credibility.

*Example:* A beauty brand shares an Instagram post about their product reformulation. They admit the previous version didn’t meet customer expectations and explain how the new formula addresses the concerns. Customers appreciate the honesty and the effort to improve.

4️⃣ **Community Building**  
Creating spaces where customers can connect with each other fosters loyalty.

*Example:* A fitness app creates a private group on Facebook where users share progress, tips, and motivation. One day, a user posts about completing their first marathon using the app’s training plan. The brand comments, “Congratulations, Alex! Your dedication is inspiring!” This interaction strengthens the community bond.

5️⃣ **Authentic Storytelling**  
Sharing genuine stories resonates emotionally with customers.

*Example:* A local coffee roaster posts a short video on TikTok about their partnership with a small family farm in Ethiopia. The video shows the coffee-growing process, interviews with the farmers, and how the partnership impacts the community. Viewers feel a stronger connection to the brand after seeing its positive impact.

6️⃣ **Focus on Value Over Sales**  
Providing useful content creates goodwill and nurtures long-term relationships.

*Example:* A software company releases a free webinar titled “5 Ways to Streamline Your Remote Team’s Workflow.” They don’t pitch their product during the session, but attendees leave with valuable insights—and a link to explore the company’s offerings if interested.

💬 **What Do You Think?**

* Have you experienced any of these strategies as a customer?
* If you’re a marketer, what’s your go-to method for building authentic relationships?

I’m torn about this Reddit because her career seems over, and I don’t love the idea of kicking someone when they’re down. But it was cathartic to see I wasn’t the only one thinking, what the fuck?

I don’t live under a rock but I never had twitter (maybe I do?) so I missed her somehow over the years. The book was recommended early this year by a fanboy in the Edmonton party scene, and I later realized plenty of people, both in Edmonton and New York, follow her on Instagram. She’s an entitled brat, not that funny, and anyone else would’ve been canceled for the magical N-word bit. That said, she perfectly captures a certain Alberta “hot chick princess brat” vibe—entitled, dumb, and oddly self-aware, like an Alberta version of Paris Hilton—but without humility. It fascinated and depressed me.

I subscribed to her Substack out of curiosity but unsubscribed when it was worse than mid-90s Cosmo. Also, the tampon story grossed me out—yeast infection waiting to happen presented as some deep lady wisdom tip. Anyway, thanks for this group for proving I’m not crazy. It’s true: the shameless confidence of formerly hot girls seems to be what “makes it” in LA, but there’s still valid criticism to be had. So, thank you. Ps: I struggle with my own stories and crazy from being a former Alberta party girl who grew up in Edmonton and had a lot of adventures in the States and I want to write about that, not in the Kelly Oxford style but I worry I caught some Edmonton brat princess virus as well that I can’t erase from my psyche. Something about oil towns…. Something about entitled Edmontonians, every time I go back there it has a sincere overly earnest dumb and dumber vibe I can’t quite articulate but I am fascinated with.

I’ve put together a super detailed itinerary for my upcoming trip to London with my friend this December. It’s our first time in the city, and we’ll be there from December 18th until the morning of the 27th. We’re celebrating my 25th birthday on the 19th and want to soak up all the Christmas magic!

We’re staying near Kensington/Hyde Park and have considered closures around December 24–26. We know that the 25th is going to be very quiet with no public transport, so we’ve planned walks through the parks and maybe a pre-booked hotel lunch. The budget is flexible, and we’re aiming to do a lot, but we’ve included optional spots in case places are closed or we run out of time.

I’d love any feedback, suggestions, or must-see spots we might have missed, especially if you know of any holiday events, great places to eat on Christmas Eve/Day, or local spots that are worth adding. Also, if you think any particular day looks too crowded or unrealistic, let me know!

**Our Highlights:**

* **Dec 18 (Arrival):** Harrods, Covent Garden, festive lights, easy evening.
* **Dec 19 (Birthday!):** Notting Hill (Portobello Road), high tea at The Ritz, West End show, cocktails at a rooftop bar.
* **Dec 20:** Harry Potter Studio Tour, Platform 9¾, Borough Market, maybe Leadenhall Market.
* **Dec 21:** Sky Garden, Tower Bridge, vintage shopping on Brick Lane, Spitalfields Market, Soho dinner.
* **Dec 22:** Westminster, Southbank, Uber Boat to Greenwich, high tea at Corinthia, maybe Battersea Power Station at night.
* **Dec 23:** Day trip to Bicester Village for designer shopping or museums if we skip it.
* **Dec 24 (Christmas Eve):** Last-minute gift shopping, afternoon tea (Charlie & The Chocolate Factory?), early dinner at Rules. Things close early.
* **Dec 25 (Christmas Day):** Quiet day, walk Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens, pre-booked hotel lunch if possible, cozy evening in.
* **Dec 26 (Boxing Day):** Sales on Oxford/Regent Street, Peggy Porschen or Biscuiteers for sweet treats, dinner in Soho/Chinatown.

**Extra Spots Considered:**

* Tons of coffee/chocolate stops: Knoops, Dark Sugars, etc.
* Hidden gems: Goodwin’s Court, Cecil Court, Leake Street Arches.
* Multiple markets: Seven Dials, Leadenhall, Borough, Spitalfields.
* Vintage/thrift shopping in Shoreditch & Brick Lane.
* Special meals at Dishoom, Bob Bob Ricard, Gymkhana, Quo Vadis.
* Harry Potter-themed cocktails at The Cauldron.
* Rooftop bars (Aqua Shard, 12th Knot, Coppa Club igloos if we can book).

**Any Thoughts?**

* Is there a better way to handle Christmas Eve/Day activities?
* Recommendations for restaurants open on Christmas Day?
* Tips on timing: Are we cramming too much into any particular day?

I’ve put together a super detailed itinerary for my upcoming trip to London with my friend this December. It’s our first time in the city, and we’ll be there from December 18th until the morning of the 27th. We’re celebrating my 25th birthday on the 19th and want to soak up all the Christmas magic!

We’re staying near Kensington/Hyde Park and have considered closures around December 24–26. We know that the 25th is going to be very quiet with no public transport, so we’ve planned walks through the parks and maybe a pre-booked hotel lunch. The budget is flexible, and we’re aiming to do a lot, but we’ve included optional spots in case places are closed or we run out of time.

I’d love any feedback, suggestions, or must-see spots we might have missed, especially if you know of any holiday events, great places to eat on Christmas Eve/Day, or local spots that are worth adding. Also, if you think any particular day looks too crowded or unrealistic, let me know!

**Our Highlights:**

* **Dec 18 (Arrival):** Harrods, Covent Garden, festive lights, easy evening.
* **Dec 19 (Birthday!):** Notting Hill (Portobello Road), high tea at The Ritz, West End show, cocktails at a rooftop bar.
* **Dec 20:** Harry Potter Studio Tour, Platform 9¾, Borough Market, maybe Leadenhall Market.
* **Dec 21:** Sky Garden, Tower Bridge, vintage shopping on Brick Lane, Spitalfields Market, Soho dinner.
* **Dec 22:** Westminster, Southbank, Uber Boat to Greenwich, high tea at Corinthia, maybe Battersea Power Station at night.
* **Dec 23:** Day trip to Bicester Village for designer shopping or museums if we skip it.
* **Dec 24 (Christmas Eve):** Last-minute gift shopping, afternoon tea (Charlie & The Chocolate Factory?), early dinner at Rules. Things close early.
* **Dec 25 (Christmas Day):** Quiet day, walk Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens, pre-booked hotel lunch if possible, cozy evening in.
* **Dec 26 (Boxing Day):** Sales on Oxford/Regent Street, Peggy Porschen or Biscuiteers for sweet treats, dinner in Soho/Chinatown.

**Extra Spots Considered:**

* Tons of coffee/chocolate stops: Knoops, Dark Sugars, etc.
* Hidden gems: Goodwin’s Court, Cecil Court, Leake Street Arches.
* Multiple markets: Seven Dials, Leadenhall, Borough, Spitalfields.
* Vintage/thrift shopping in Shoreditch & Brick Lane.
* Special meals at Dishoom, Bob Bob Ricard, Gymkhana, Quo Vadis.
* Harry Potter-themed cocktails at The Cauldron.
* Rooftop bars (Aqua Shard, 12th Knot, Coppa Club igloos if we can book).

**Any Thoughts?**

* Is there a better way to handle Christmas Eve/Day activities?
* Recommendations for restaurants open on Christmas Day?
* Tips on timing: Are we cramming too much into any particular day?
* Any must-try seasonal treats we should add?
* Any neighborhoods or markets better visited earlier in the trip due to crowds?

I am in dental school. And I want to sleep less. I need more time to study and do work. My friend she sleeps only 3 hours a night and never gets tired or headaches or moody. She gets so much work done. I need to be like her so I can get better grades. 

But everytime I sleep and don’t have class the next day, I end up sleeping a full 9 hours. I’ll set so many alarms but snooze ALL of them and keep sleeping. I NEED to wake up and study most mornings,especially on days off but I just can’t, I keep snoozing and sleeping. Even when I get 6 hours in. I won’t stop snoozing alarms until I get 8-9. I know it’s a mental strength battle to push urself to get up. But are their tips for getting there? It’s hard bc I know when I wake up all I have to look forward to is HOURS of studying which is so unmotivating. 

Last night I tried to brew a cup of coffee and put it next to my table for the morning. I woke up at 7am, chugged the coffee, AND WENT BACK TO SLEEP TILL 10 😭. I use a lamp that turns on the light automatically at 7am. Doesn’t work. Idk what else to do to get me up. 

Most nights when I have class i get 6 hours. Sometimes 4-5. Sometimes 8-9. Depending on school work. But usually 6 when school is rough. But lately I’ve been pushing 8-9 every day and it’s so u productive and bad. I am a female And when I get <5 hours for more than three days in a row I get headaches brain fog and can’t function. So I’m aiming to function on 6 hours. I want to stop being lazy. 

Please tips on how to train myself mentally and my brain to get up. Anyways thanks for the help in advance. ",1,1733634785.0,sleep,1,1.0,False

She was totally into me, but I just wasn't sure if I was all that attracted to her back.  She wasn't terrible looking or anything, just went from being very attractive online to looking, just kind of ok in person.  I don't want to seem shallow but it bugged me.  I think she used very old pictures online.  However, she was very nice and we had a good conversation, by the end of it I started to REALLY like her A LOT, but I just kept thinking it was a shame that her pics were not accurate to how she looked in reality & I was not sure if I was that into her physically.  I was also thinking that maybe I should not go so much on looks this time, I should go based on how she is as a person.

At this point I am on the fence about her.  She wanted to meet again, I agreed, and I am supposed to meet her tomorrow.  I told her ahead of time not to get hopes up and it takes me meeting a person at least 3 times to decide if we are a match.  Not necessarily true but I was kind of giving myself an out if I am not feeling it.  

So I am giving it another chance, because maybe tomorrow I will really feel a spark and like her more, but just in case I don't I really do NOT want to hurt her feelings.  I would feel really bad.  I don't want to go with the typical excuse of ""There just wasn't enough chemistry"" because too many people use that.  Her life is really not together though right now at all, as far as her job/financial situation, so maybe I could use that as an excuse, that I need to find some one more aligned with me in that way? I am still worried about hurting her feelings even with that excuse.  

Can anyone give me advice? Just in case I decide we are not a match.  Who knows, maybe I will like her & decide to continue this, but I need a way out in case I don't.

But everyone gives free delivery.  And there doesn't seem to be any way that they can build this free delivery into their already impossibly low prices.  For example, there was a walnut coffee table on Ebay for $350 (at least $200 in materials).  The place that builds it was in the UK.  I live in Canada and they offered me free delivery right up until paying at checkout.  So I went online just to see how cheap I could get that same size of table if it were collapsed into pieces to minimize space.  It was $1700 from the UK to my city.

So I asked the Ebay support how they think someone could offer such a deal, and they said that I may have to create relationships with shippers that may give a discount in return for more business in the future.  It still seems impossible.  And I wouldn't even know where to start building relationships.

For those who don't know about the book:
There is a cafe in which there is a specific table at which if you sit, you can go back in past but you have to stay at the table in the past so you cant do anything or meet anyone who has never been to the cafe and if you dont drink your coffee before it gets cold you become a ghost.

The interesting thing is the concept of closure is explored well. Even if the time travel itself seems useless people go back to talk to poeple who died, people they have wronged etc. ",13,1733634313.0,Indianbooks,3,1.0,False

Is the count low because my body has adapted to using the fat for energy instead of just flushing the ketones out or is there something else I should check is okay? The physical results are making sense, but the strip results threw me off.",1,1733634300.0,fasting,4,1.0,False

I've lost my passion for the sector by dealing with so much red tape, poor leadership, toxic work cultures, and continually feeling like folks just don't want to do what's right, only what's easy. I'm ready to move out of the field and I've always wanted to work outside more, building and repairing things. As a kid I worked summers at my uncle's farm and my first job was cleaning horse stalls and mowing pastures at around 10-12 years old for my friend's parents - some of my happiest memories are of manual labor.  I've built a couple basic tables and just finished two lofted beds for my two oldest boys. I have dreams of building a small cabin on a little piece of land we just bought. Not a skilled carpenter by any stretch of the imagination, but have a lot of interest in it, enjoying working with wood immensely and learning new tools, can do basic math though I'm sure I'd benefit from refreshers, and again - I love to learn and I'm beyond ready for a career change.

Other semi-relevant experience is in one of my non-profit roles as a program director I partnered with a local agency that built beds for kids in need. I wrote all the grants to pay for the lumber and led teams of teen volunteers for a week at a time along with a group of volunteer carpenters to train the kids on various tools like miter saws, drill presses, orbital sanders, and basic power drills as well as the simple math needed for the bed builds. Over the course of two years we built and delivered 525 beds. Additionally, I did something very similar with another local agency where I led a team of teens and worked with volunteer carpenters to install a privacy fence and frame out interior walls for a low-income family's new house they earned at a steep discount and friendly loan terms through a lengthy application process. Personally, I volunteer with a non-profit that helps kids and adults with developmental disabilities. I'm in my mid 30s and have three kids. While the first couple years of the apprenticeship program looks like it would be a significant decrease in my current non-profit salary, I'm willing to accept that hardship in the short-term while I learn and gain on-the-job hours. 

Is there anyone in here that has gone through the MACRC carpentry apprenticeship program , or know someone that has, that I could chat with? This is what I've been looking at  - [https://www.carpentersunion.org/training/](https://www.carpentersunion.org/training/) Happy to talk online or buy you lunch, coffee, or beer sometime.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/wEqwL6nEid): **November 7, 2023** 

Throwaway as my husband knows my Reddit. 

I 34(f) have been with Ken -not his real name-37(m) since I was 16. We met in school as he was my brothers friend. We have been married for 10years. Have a 2year old son and one on the way. Ken has always been my person. The person who you can’t picture life without and I honestly can’t remember not loving him. I grew up with him, he’s my everything. 

Unfortunately Ken has this issue where he takes on everyone else’s feelings like to heart. I’m not saying it’s a bad thing, however recently his best friend of 20years has just found out that his wife has been cheating on him and none of the children are his. Obviously his friend is devastated and is staying in our guest room. He’s a nice guy just life has him down right now. He’s started the process of divorce. The more time Ken spends with his friend the more depressed he’s become. And distant. 

Our mornings use to start where I would wake up at 6am with our son make breakfast then about 8am I could wake Ken up with a coffee and some breakfast before going to drop little one off at nursery and go to work. Ken works from home most days only going into the office on a Monday. So I’d give him his coffee he’d give me a kiss and then I’d go off on my happy little way. Then I’d finish work, get our son and go home where Ken would be making tea. I’d clean up after whilst he was bathing our son and putting him to bed. 

I thought this was life, it might sound boring to some but it was my life and I loved it. Our house was filled with love. We would spend our nights cuddling, talking watching a movie. Date night once a month. We would take our son out together on a Saturday and then Sunday go visit family or have friends over. You get the picture I’m rambling. Sorry. 

Anyway, for the past month things have been…changing. Ken is more depressed. I make him a coffee in the morning and just get a mumbled “thanks”. I’d come home from work and the friend and him would be in the livingroom watching sports. I’m now making tea. Bathing our son, neither of them will barely talk to me. We don’t go out on the weekends together I feel like a single parent. I’ve tried to talk to Ken about it all but I get one worded answers. Then he stays up till about 1am which I know it’s not super late but I’m passed out by then, I’m exhausted, alone and pregnant. I miss my husband. 

Yesterday I came home from work and you know when something just doesn’t feel right? Well, I went to find Ken to see what he was doing as his friend wasn’t in the house but Ken’s car was. He was in his office looking up DNA kits for our son. I asked him why and his response was “well I just want to make sure all the kids are mine before I continue looking after them as I’m not a free childcare”. 

This broke me. When I say I’m devastated it’s an understatement. But if he thinks that I’ve cheated on him then surely the trust is gone? Is there any going back? Am I just being pregnant and hormonal? Would I be extreme for looking for a divorce? I could put the papers in the envelope with the results from the DNA test. 

I think I’m gonna go cry in bed now. Had to take the day off work as I feel like I’ve just been gut punched.

[I’ve asked my husband to move out. Am I taking this too far?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/8sz4fZfrfr):  **November 7, 2023 (Same day, 11 hours later)** 

Hello Reddit, well after my post earlier this afternoon I cried then read all your lovely comments and I couldn’t be more greatful. I think posting about it here really helps for some reason. Weird how telling complete strangers that I’m struggling with life seems to help. 

So I think after my pity party which couldn’t last long due to being a parent I called my step-mum and dad (my mum died when I was 10) they are coming to stay with me on Friday. Crying on the phone helped although I’m not really sure they could truly understand a word of what I was saying. I’ve spoken to Ken…well more like spoke at Ken telling him that his friend has till Thursday to leave. I’m not a monster and can’t just tell him to leave at the drop of a hat. I’ve also told Ken he needs to leave too. Whilst yes I could go to my dads house I don’t want to disrupt my little one more than needed and all the things for my baby is here too. Especially as I’m 8months along it just seems stupid for me to be the one to leave. 

I’ve made it a point of not pointing out it’s my house either. I’m trying to be calm and sensible. I’m not 100% sure Ken listened but I did message his sister who is a force to be reckoned with and she said she will make sure he’s gone by Thursday night. Things I’ve told Ken I want is yes he can have the DNA test but I will be damned if I’m the one to do it. He can also have one for the baby as I ain’t got shit to hide. I know that some people have questioned why I’m so against it. 

Let me make something clear. I would never cheat because as I said in my last post Ken is/or was I dunno, my person. He’s the only man I’ve ever been with. So that isn’t any concern of mine. I’m just hurt that he wants one because clearly he doesn’t trust me. 

So things I want. I want him to have the DNA tests mainly so I can make him eat the results (not literally I’m just venting) I’m also going to suggest couples therapy. I already see one due to losing my mum and my little sister in a car crash when I was little. I want to suggest he sees one alone but you can lead a horse to water but can’t make him drink it, I don’t wanna force him to do anything he doesn’t want to do. I want him to maintain contact with our son, yes he doesn’t believe he’s the father right now but that’s no reason he should neglect him as he’s his and I don’t want to upset my son. Yea he’s only two but still he deserves all the love from both his parents. He’s done nothing wrong. Then obviously this one when he/she comes along. 

Still not sure about the state of my marriage but even if divorce is what happens I need to be able to get through to him so he can be the father he was. Am I going insane? Do I sound insane? I don’t know why writing here helps so much. Thanks Reddit.

[My husband got his DNA test results. He still thinks I’ve cheated](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/QjkAjKZaOk): **November 13, 2023 (six days later)** 

Hello again, I don’t know how to update posts so I just had to make another one. 

Following my two other posts I will answer some questions, yes it is my house. It was left to me when my mum died. I have lived here all my life. I didn’t move out because I have a child and one on the way so why should I be the one to leave. I get that some people believe I was the AH for asking him to leave but as I was heavily pregnant, have a toddler and it’s my house I wasn’t about to leave. Yes he could of stayed but have you tried living with someone who just wants to argue or just not talk? I’d prefer my child not to live in that environment thank you. At the end of the day I’m a mother first and a wife second. If you think that’s harsh then I don’t know what to tell you. My children come first end of. 

Well Ken’s friend did leave the day I told him he had till Thursday. He wasn’t happy about it and shouted some insults at me which was amazing. Ken’s sister came and picked up Ken. I wish I could tell you what she said but she didn’t say anything in front of me just kept giving Ken death stares. We did get the DNA test for little one and Ken is the father…obviously. Ken somehow thinks I’ve intercepted the results even tho I wasn’t the one that did it. I wasn’t the one that got handed the results ect so he’s clearly lost his mind. 

My dad came over and whilst I was making tea my waters broke. My little girl is here she healthy and happy. She was 9lb 8oz so no concern of anything with her. I’m now a mum of two. I am home now and Ken has been to see his baby girl although as she’s not had a DNA test he disagrees with her being his because “his family doesn’t have many girls” yet he has a sister so I just rolled my eyes. I don’t really know where to go from here. Ken is refusing therapy he says there’s nothing wrong with him or his brain. I beg to differ. He wants to get ANOTHER DNA test for our boy but won’t tell me when or where so I can’t interfere. Maybe one day he will come to his senses. 

My dad and step mum are staying with me for a while to help me with the baby’s. I’d like to say I’m ok but honestly my emotions are all over the show I don’t know which was is up. Ken’s sister visits the baby’s and we have an unspoken rule that we don’t speak about Ken apart from when our son asks about him. I wish it was the kind of update where he got the results seen how much of a idiot he’s been and we move on but sadly that’s not the case. I can’t dwell on it to much just take shit one day at a time. 

I do miss my person and worry that he’s missing out on his baby girls life already which if I think about to much I will just sit and cry but I don’t have time for that. As always thanks for listening to me rant. I might update if anything else happens in my life. Right now I’m still left wondering if I’m doing the right thing here. Is there anything I could do differently? Why are my kids so hard for him to accept all of a sudden?

[AITA for making it difficult for him to find a solicitor?](https://www.reddit.com/u/Patient-Somewhere-86/s/hMGNvR4b15): **November 23, 2023 (10 days later)** 

Hello again Reddit. Things have been Bizarre but now I have closure. I know what’s happened to my marriage. I know what scum Ken really is. He’s not my person and never truly was. So now I just want to divorce him, cut my loses and move on with my life.

Im still at home with my babies settling into motherhood. My dad and Step mum are still here but they will be leaving soon once I’m more emotionally stable. To say I’m ok would be a lie but I now know what I need to do.

I have some sort of closure with Ken. I know what happened with him and I know that it’s not my fault. Turns out Ken was having an affair and has a baby on the way. Even typing that makes me want to throw up.

I found this out when a visibly pregnant lady just knocked on my door and asked me when I would be leaving the house as “it’s Ken’s house”. When I say this confused the crap out of me I mean it.

I talked to this women for a while to try to work out what she was talking about. It turns out that she’s Ken’s side piece. Well technically in her head she’s his fiancée. A month ago Ken got down on one knee and proposed to her in my fucking kitchen….classy right.

So they have been seeing each other for a while. She’s having his baby. She believes I’m the ex wife who Ken is letting him stay in his house till I get on my feet. We apparently broke up a few years ago and none of my kids are Ken’s. When I goto work in the mornings Ken goes to her house and works from there. They were waiting for marriage to move in together. How you trying to marry someone when you are already married? Fucking weirdo.

I asked for proof of all this. She has pictures of them together. Apparently she has a OF account that they make content together 🤮🤮. I told her we are still married and explained everything to her.

I’m not sure what she’s going to do. But hey not my circus not my monkey. Now I want a divorce. Is it true that once you talk to a solicitor about divorce they can’t represent the person your divorce? I want to go around our town and meet with as many solicitors as possible as the first hour is free so that he has a very hard time getting representation? Is that too petty?

The house is in my name only and is protected so there is no way he can take it. I have all my money and we do have a joint account but that’s just what we put our share of household bills in. I haven’t spoken directly with Ken. His family have completely cut him off and he’s been kicked out of his sisters house.

All those people that was concerned about him having tumour or something wrong with his brain I really don’t think that’s the case. I think his actions just caught up to him as his lies were going to come out once his baby was born. I think that’s what happened. He got backed into a corner and tried to fight his way out.

Through divorce process I will get the court to do DNA testing so he has proof for both. Even if he chooses to not believe it. I’m mentally exhausted from all of this and sat wondering how I didn’t notice. Might have to go for an eye test.

But honestly would I be so wrong for just making his life as difficult as possible to get legal advice or is that too far? I want him to suffer.

[I’m finally divorced and couldn’t be happier](https://www.reddit.com/u/Patient-Somewhere-86/s/1IE5RDrJAL): **December 1, 2024 (one year later)**

Well hello there again Reddit. I’m ok. I totally just forgot about my ramblings on here lol. Im doing ok. I’m officially divorced from Ken.

It took a long time to get to this part of my life and and some points i actually felt like I was drowning. Both of my kids had a DNA test through the courts and they are Ken’s. He still doesn’t believe it. Not my problem tho.

Ken is now in prison for domestic abuse. I’m not 100% on the details because I wasn’t involved. It was his side piece.

I’d love to say that sometimes I don’t break down in tears and I’m completely over it. But I’m not. I’ve now gone back to work tho after my maternity leave was finished. I got a promotion. And now I’m use to living with just us three. My kids keep me going and I’m so proud of them. They go visit their grandparents and dads side of the family and they have been so lovely and supportive. His sister is still amazing.

I don’t really know what else to say. Just I’m ok. I’m divorced and my children are thriving. I can’t thank Ken for a lot of things but I’m greatful for my children. 😊

**Top Comment**

**Commenter:** I have this habit of not being able to move forward once I come across a situation like yours. I need reassurance, confirmation, and even closure to even move on. Even though the situation doesn't involve me, I hate seeing women in marriages that have a husband that cheats.

Now, you brought me peace in knowing that you're safe and thriving for your kids. I'm so happy that you have him out of your life and I hope he rots in prison for his stupid behavior through all of this.

I hope that you continue to thrive and continue to live your life to the fullest, same goes for your kids.

Stay safe, and continue thriving OP. 🫶🏽❤️

==================================================================

""Discover the SECRET of Fresh breath for Dog https://freepage.pro/samutores/dogfresh""

Let’s face it—there’s nothing quite like the joy of having a furry friend greeting you with slobbery kisses. But as endearing as those wet-nosed affections are, that unmistakable doggy breath can sometimes be a dealbreaker. Whether it smells like something died in there or just gives off a stale aroma, bad breath in dogs is more common than you might think. Not only is it unpleasant for us humans, but it could also signal underlying health issues for your canine companion. Luckily, dog treats for bad breath are here to save the day!

In this guide, we’ll explore the root causes of bad dog breath, the importance of dental care, and how specially formulated treats can help freshen up your pup’s smile. So grab a seat, maybe a cup of coffee, and let’s dive into the world of canine freshness!

Understanding Your Dog's Bad Breath
-----------------------------------

Before we roll up our sleeves and start tossing around dog treats for bad breath, it's essential to understand why your dog's breath smells less than pleasant. Bad breath, or ""halitosis,"" can be a symptom of various issues ranging from simple dietary mishaps to serious health conditions.

### Common Causes of Bad Breath in Dogs

1. **Poor Dental Hygiene**: Just like humans, dogs need regular dental care. Bacteria can build up in their mouths, forming plaque and tartar that lead to unpleasant odors.
2. **Dietary Choices**: Some foods can cause your dog to develop bad breath. If you're feeding them low-quality kibble or human food loaded with sugar, that might be part of the problem.
3. **Health Issues**: Conditions like kidney disease, diabetes, or oral tumors can contribute to foul-smelling breath. Always consult your vet if a sudden change occurs.
4. **Foreign Bodies**: Occasionally, dogs munch on things they shouldn’t. If they swallow something foreign or develop a dental abscess, it could wreak havoc in their mouths.

### Importance of Addressing Bad Breath

Ignoring bad breath isn’t just a matter of unpleasantness; it can also be a sign of neglecting your pet’s overall health. Regular check-ups with your veterinarian and maintaining good dental hygiene can prevent bigger problems down the road. Plus, wouldn’t you rather cuddle with a dog who has minty-fresh breath?

The Role of Dental Treats
-------------------------

Now that we've established why your pooch might have bad breath, let's discuss how dog treats for bad breath play a pivotal role in keeping your dog's mouth fresh and healthy. Dental treats aren't just tasty snacks; they're often specifically designed to enhance oral health. They can assist in plaque control, freshening breath, and even providing essential nutrients.

### How Dental Treats Work

- **Mechanical Action**: Many dog treats have a unique texture that helps scrub away plaque and tartar. When your dog chews on these treats, they’re essentially brushing their teeth without even knowing it!
- **Ingredients That Freshen Breath**: Look for ingredients like chlorophyll, parsley, or mint, which naturally combat odor and freshen breath.
- **Additives for Health**: Some dental treats come fortified with vitamins and minerals that are beneficial for your dog’s overall health, ensuring they get a little nutritious kick along with their snack.

### Popular Types of Dog Treats for Bad Breath

When it comes to selecting the right treats, variety is the spice of life! Here are some popular options:

1. **Rawhide Chews**: Known for their toughness, these chews can help scrape away tartar while providing hours of entertainment. Just keep an eye on your pup to ensure they don't gulp large pieces.
2. **Dental Chews**: Specifically designed for oral health, these treats come in various shapes and sizes to fit different breeds. They’re often infused with breath-freshening ingredients.
3. **Natural Snacks**: Bite-sized rewards made from wholesome ingredients can also help, especially those packed with ingredients like sweet potatoes or peanut butter!
4. **Homemade Options**: Feeling adventurous? You can whip up your homemade dog treats using ingredients like pumpkin and mint, ensuring your pup gets a fresh and tasty snack.

Choosing the Right Treats
-------------------------

With so many options available, how do you choose the best dog treats for bad breath? Here are some criteria to consider.

### Ingredients Matter

Always look at the ingredient list. Aim for products with:

- Natural ingredients
- Limited preservatives
- No artificial flavors or colors

### Size and Texture

The size and texture of a treat are crucial. Larger, harder treats usually do a better job at scrubbing teeth, while smaller, softer ones might be more suited for quick rewards.

### Brand Reputation

Stick to reputable brands that specialize in pet care. Reading reviews and finding recommendations can guide you toward safe and effective products.

DIY Dog Treats: A Fresh Twist
-----------------------------

What’s better than giving your dog store-bought treats? Making them at home! Not only can you customize the flavors, but you can also ensure they’re made with wholesome ingredients. Here’s a simple recipe that incorporates breath-freshening elements.

### Minty Fresh Dog Biscuits

#### Ingredients:

- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1/4 cup oats
- 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
- 1 egg

#### Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a mixing bowl, combine all ingredients until a dough forms.
3. Roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut into fun shapes.
4. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 20–25 minutes or until golden brown.
5. Allow to cool before serving to your furry friend.

These treats not only satisfy your dog’s taste buds but also pack a minty punch to help combat that awful breath!

Maintaining Oral Health Beyond Treats
-------------------------------------

While dog treats for bad breath are fantastic, they shouldn't be your only line of defense. A comprehensive approach to dental care will ensure your pup maintains a sparkling smile.

### Regular Teeth Brushing

Brushing your dog's teeth might sound daunting, but it’s one of the most effective ways to maintain their oral hygiene. Aim for once a week, gradually increasing the frequency as your dog becomes more accustomed to it.

### Routine Vet Check-Ups

Make sure to schedule annual veterinary visits for professional cleanings and dental evaluations. Your vet can catch issues before they become significant problems.

### Consider Toothpaste Made for Dogs

Human toothpaste is a no-go for pets. Instead, invest in toothpaste formulated specifically for dogs. Look for flavors that appeal to your pup, like chicken or beef!

### Chewing Toys

Besides treats, consider dental toys that stimulate chewing. These toys can withstand vigorous chewing while cleaning teeth and providing mental stimulation.

Signs Your Dog Might Need Extra Help

(28M) On the verge of deppression!😔 HELP!!!,"In early 2024, I moved to a new city with a new job, and it came with a lot of stress. I started drinking excessive coffee, which led to bloating and blood in my stool. The blood stopped after I quit coffee, but the bloating persisted, especially after consuming dairy (I was drinking 500ml of milk daily).

A couple of months later, I started developing hives. Initially, I thought it was due to allergies and stopped eating legumes, which helped somewhat, but the hives became random with no clear triggers.

First Doctor Visit I consulted a doctor who ran some blood tests. The results showed high bilirubin levels, but everything else was normal. The doctor said there was nothing to worry about and prescribed antihistamines. I took them for 2 weeks, and while they worked temporarily, the hives returned as soon as I stopped the medication.

2 Months Ago The symptoms worsened significantly. I started experiencing:

Severe stomach discomfort, with a constant ""sandpaper"" sensation. Foul-smelling, sticky stool (possibly fat malabsorption?). Occasional heartburn. I visited another doctor who prescribed an antacid and probiotics. This combination worked for about a month. During this time, my bowel movements normalized, and both the bloating and hives disappeared. I was following a low FODMAP diet and incorporating protein powder into my meals.

While Traveling While traveling, I couldn't find the prescribed probiotics and switched to a generic brand from Amazon. It worked briefly, but after returning home and indulging in sweets and fried foods, the hives and abdominal pain came back even worse. My stools became foul-smelling and fatty again.

Current Situation I recently consulted another doctor who prescribed Rossgut 400 (an antibiotic) and a PPI. While on Rossgut, I experienced no hives, no bloating, and normal bowel movements for 2 weeks. However, as soon as the course ended, my symptoms returned. Now I’m dealing with:

Dry mouth and excessive thirst after meals. Shortness of breath. A feeling of food being stuck in my stomach. Loss of appetite. Incomplete bowel movements. My weight has dropped from 70kg to 65kg in this time.

Current Routine I’m taking multivitamins, calcium, cabbage juice (morning and evening), and L-glutamine. My diet is restricted to bananas, khichdi, and boiled chicken, as these are the only foods I can tolerate without severe symptoms.

Mental Health I’ve always been an active person with very rare drinking habits and a clean diet. In fact, my parents think eating “too clean” might be the cause of all this. But now, I’m feeling completely drained. Depression is creeping in, and I’ve been having bad thoughts. I feel stuck, scared, and like there’s no end to this.

If anyone has been through something similar or can offer advice, please help me out. I’d really appreciate any support or suggestions. 🙏",1,1733633998.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1h9b90f,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1h9b90f/small_space_styling_choosing_the_right_rugs_for/,Small Space Styling: Choosing the Right Rugs for Compact Areas,"Styling a small space can feel like a challenge, but the right choices can make even the tiniest room feel spacious and inviting. One of the most impactful design elements in compact areas is [rugs and carpets](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs). The right rug not only adds warmth and texture but can also visually expand a room, create defined spaces, and enhance the overall aesthetic. If you’re looking to transform your small living area, here’s your ultimate guide to choosing the perfect [rugs for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) and beyond.

# 1. Choose the Right Size for the Space

When it comes to small spaces, size matters. A rug that's too small can make the room look disjointed, while one that's too large may overwhelm the space. For living rooms, ensure the rug is large enough to fit under the front legs of your furniture, creating a cohesive and grounded look. If you’re unsure, a versatile [white rug](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/black-and-white-rug) can be a great starting point—it adds a sense of openness while complementing a variety of styles.

# 2. Light Colors for a Spacious Feel

Neutral tones and light-colored rugs are perfect for compact areas as they reflect light, creating the illusion of a bigger room. A **white rug** or one in soft beige or pastel shades can brighten up the space while making it feel airy. Pair it with contrasting furniture or cushions to create depth and balance.

# 3. Add Patterns for Personality

Small spaces don’t have to be boring! Incorporate patterned rugs to inject personality into the room. Geometric designs, stripes, or subtle florals can draw the eye and make the room feel dynamic. However, avoid overly busy patterns that may overwhelm a compact area. Stick to designs that balance style and simplicity, especially in high-traffic areas like the **rugs for living room**.

# 4. Focus on Texture

Texture plays a crucial role in small space styling. High-pile rugs can add coziness but may not be practical in tight spaces. Opt for low-pile or flatweave **rugs and carpets** for a sleeker look that's easier to maintain. Textured rugs with woven details or subtle embossing can add interest without overpowering the room.

# 5. Define Zones with Rugs

In open-plan or multi-functional small spaces, rugs can help define zones. Use different rugs to visually separate areas such as a dining nook, living room, or workspace. A neutral **white rug** under your coffee table, paired with a bold accent rug in the dining corner, can create distinct yet harmonious spaces.

# 6. Consider Material and Maintenance

For high-traffic compact areas, durability is key. Choose materials like wool, cotton, or synthetic blends that are easy to clean and maintain. If you’re shopping in the UAE, [carpets Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) stores offer a range of options that combine style and functionality, ideal for small spaces.

# 7. Layer for a Stylish Look

Layering rugs is a popular trend that works well in small spaces. Start with a larger neutral base rug and add a smaller accent rug with bold patterns or colors. This adds dimension to your space while keeping it visually balanced.

# 8. Shop Local for Unique Finds

For those in Dubai, the local market offers a wealth of unique **rugs and carpets** that cater to small-space needs. From sleek modern designs to traditional Persian rugs, **carpets Dubai** stores have options to suit every taste and style. Shopping locally also allows you to explore textures, sizes, and designs in person to find the perfect fit for your home.

# Final Thoughts

Selecting the right **rugs and carpets** for small spaces is about balancing functionality with style. Whether you’re drawn to the timeless appeal of a **white rug** or the dynamic charm of patterned **rugs for living room**, the key is to choose pieces that enhance your space without overwhelming it. With thoughtful choices, even the smallest area can become a cozy, stylish haven.

I went gluten free last year for 2 months. (Nov-oct) I did it just to experiment. My allergy test says I don’t have a wheat allergy and my gluten bloodwork came back with nothing worrying. 
But as soon as I stopped going gluten free my body’s health has gone down hill :/.
My current symptoms are chest tightness, like a squeeze on my heart, shallow breathing (some days are ok some days are worse) and non stop burping.

My diet was very mixed and healthy I’m not a person who eats junk foot rarely. Anybody else had symptoms
Like that? 

Btw before going gluten free I had severe carpal tunnel on my left hand after going gluten free it’s not that bad anymore. (I’m still now eating gluten)

Ive gotten checked out by 4 cardiologists who can’t find anything wrong with my heart, I’m now seeing pulmonologists trying to figure something out. I’ve never had breathing issues in the past. 

A big incident that happened to me in May was when I was eating dinner, I was having mozzarella sticks, I had a random heart attack. No it wasn’t anxiety. I was eating and then my mind goes blank I knew something was wrong I lay down on my bed and then bam a stab in my heart for a few minutes. I was in denial it was a heart attack until the next morning I had my coffee and it cause another mini incident. So I went to the hospital where they kept me over night trying to figure out why my heart reacted like that. I stayed over night, the ct scan came back clear and they dismissed it as a GERD issue.

Speaking of coffee, you absolutely have to check out Intelligentsia Coffee. The blue tile exterior is Instagram-worthy, but the coffee is what really makes it special. I usually grab my coffee and head to the Silver Lake Reservoir for a morning walk. The path around the reservoir is about 2.2 miles and gives you amazing views of the hills.

For food lovers (aka everyone), the restaurant scene here is incredible. Sqirl is famous for their ricotta toast, and yes, it lives up to the hype. Night + Market Song serves some of the best Thai food I've had outside of Thailand. If you're into vegan food, Little Pine Restaurant will blow your mind.

The Sunset Junction area is where you'll find most of the action. It's packed with vintage clothing stores, record shops, and local businesses. I love spending afternoons just wandering around, popping into places like Mohawk General Store or Silverlake Flea Market.

If you're looking to explore Silver Lake and other cool LA neighborhoods, I found this awesome service that offers guided tours and unique local experiences: https://athometouch.com/losangeles. They really know their stuff and show you places you might miss on your own.

One of my favorite spots is the Silver Lake Stairs. These painted public staircases are scattered throughout the neighborhood and offer some serious workout potential plus great photo ops. The Micheltorena Stairs with their heart design are probably the most famous.

For music lovers, check out Rockaway Records. They've got an incredible collection of vinyl and music memorabilia. And if you're into architecture, the neighborhood is full of amazing mid-century modern homes designed by famous architects like Richard Neutra.

At sunset, head to the Silver Lake Meadow. It's this gorgeous grassy area next to the reservoir where locals gather for picnics and to watch the sky turn pink over the Hollywood Hills. Pure magic!

Want to make the most of your Silver Lake adventure? Check out some awesome local tours and activities here: https://athometouch.com/losangeles. They've got some really unique experiences that'll help you see the neighborhood like a local.

Silver Lake is definitely the kind of place where you can spend a whole day just wandering and discovering new spots. Every time I visit, I find something new to love about this neighborhood. It's got this perfect balance of being hip without trying too hard, which is pretty rare in LA.

Have you guys visited Silver Lake before? What are your favorite spots? Would love to hear about your experiences in the comments!",1,1733633481.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

Part 20- At the Iron Blood dorm ,"This Series is sister to ""Steel Valkyries"", which technically takes place before the events of ""Siren Thesis"", all within a cluster of branches where the Sirens have decided to undertake inland incursions.

Summary:

Buggy and Stormcat make their way around Azur Lane after being dismissed from the testing site, a less than gentle nudge for them to go and be part of whatever activity they want to undertake, that is not technically work-related. And Stormcat has a certain place she has set herself to go visit for her own unconventional reasons.

[Previous part](https://www.reddit.com/r/Azurlanefanfics/comments/1h3s2tb/siren_thesis_part_192_the_debriefing/) \-

////

It was an almost idyllic midday within the port, a blue sky, cool winds gently blowing, bringing the calming scent of the sea as well a refreshing sensation even with the midfall’s sun on one's back.

In the middle of such blissful weather, Buggy and Stormcat were walking at a calm pace through the port of Azur Lane. Both feeling like they had achieved a great deal of things, regardless of being technically on a forced vacation, imposed on them by the commander of Azur Lane. But alas, more than once they had a discussion or two about the subject, all Valkyries agreed that they felt somewhat restless if they were not moving or doing something.

Even now, during their small vacation, they found enjoyment in participating in whatever activity took place within Azur Lane. Fortunately for them, many of the Kansen also preferred to be active as well as creating some sort of event.

After lending a hand on the second day of tests performed with the Siren walker, brought by Doctor Bethencourt, they had been graciously kicked off the test site by some of the girls. Insisting that they shouldn’t spend their free time on the test grounds, since it was technically work-related, and encouraging them to find something else to do, preferably something that didn’t require a report at the end of the activity.

When it came to actually do something they wished to do for themselves, it was Stormcat that had something in mind that she wanted to do, or rather, something they could do only now that they were at the main base of Azur Lane.

 

“You really memorized the whole place already, uh?” Buggy asked, finally breaking the silence that had settled once they made their way out of the test site.

“Well, we had plenty of opportunities, on the first day they gave us a brief tour.” Stormcat replied “Plus, this morning Coby convinced me to accompany her on a morning jog alongside Tennessee and some other girls keen on taking advantage of every second of daylight.”

“ah… how was that like?” Buggy asked somewhat gingerly about it.

While they preferred to be on the move or doing something, there was always individual characteristics and peculiarities to the Valkyries. And in Buggy’s case while she was quite reliable and serious, she tried her best to take to heart the idea of this being a break of sorts. As such, she certainly did not spend her first morning in Azur Lane waking up her teammates at dawn break in order to go for a jog around the island. Plus, from the sounds being made early morning on their accommodations, as well as the current conversation, someone else took it into their hands that her team had some morning exercises.

“Eh, it is a nice enough place. It’s the people that make it shine, really. Some of these girls are quite cheerful and accommodating.” Stormcat shrugged her shoulders at that statement.

“The arrangement of the base is kinda hectic. We made our way to pick up some more people from each dorm to join the jog around the base. It’s a pretty common thing for them, apparently. That’s why I know where to go now.”

“And where is that? You kind of just started walking without saying where you intended to go.”

“Oh, I didn’t tell you?” Stormcat giggled at that.

“E-yup, sure haven’t”

“I see, my bad, sorry.”

""You still haven’t answered my question"" Buggy insisted in a semi-playful tone.

""Fine, if you want to be so insistent about it."" Stormcat replied while raising her hands in a defeated gesture.

And regardless of such a statement, Stormcat simply remained quiet for the next few minutes. Buggy could only sigh internally, as well as quite openly about it. Her companion was wont to have bouts of whimsical behavior, and she knew by vast amounts of unfortunate experience that once Stormcat got into such a mood, it was simply better to not pursue any further, especially if one didn't feel like engaging in some kind of tomfoolery.

And they were technically in vacation time, as such she simply allowed the lull of the conversation to turn into a pleasant sort of quiet moment where she didn't have to get straight answers out of her team.

It was after several minutes of walking through the well paved roads of Azur Lane that they reached one of the various Kansen dorms. Buggy was surprised by the sight of it, she more or less expected something militaristic in nature, but in reality it had the profile of a common modern building. It certainly didn't look the part of a modern corporate building, but it still held a certain degree of that ominous feel from such a place.

Thinking about it she realized that she didn't know enough architecture to be able to formulate an opinion about the minute details of modern architecture. To her it was a building, it had its walls and it had its windows. She didn't feel like the building was making any sort of statement about anything in particular. Probably about being a neat and tidy place, if anything.

Stormcat entered without any sign of apprehension and Buggy just followed her inside, onto what was obviously a reception of sorts, a couple of couches with a coffee table in between, calm music could be heard coming from somewhere within the reception, with magazines and newspapers on the coffee table and even a reception desk past that, giving the impression that they had entered a lobby rather than a dorm.

"" *Guten Morgen* . What can I do for you?"" A girl manning the desk said.

Buggy was somewhat startled by the voice as she didn't realize someone else was in that room with them. Now that she paid closer attention, the girl behind the desk looked both serious as well as somewhat reluctant to be at her current station. Or perhaps a bit too distant. So far Buggy had interacted with a whole bunch of extroverted Kansen, so this would be her first interaction with someone that was more on the quiet side.

The girl had short dark brown hair held on a few braids, 2 small ones framing her face, and most notably her tidy and somewhat complex uniform that drapped her in dark blues, red and golden accents, A beret on her head and most notably a puppet that seemed to be made out of metal on her right arm.

""Eh, we came to see whoever has the food."" Stormcat stated.

Buggy´s mind came to a screeching halt upon hearing her companion's words. Many ideas and words came to mind as well as possible implications of what could be actually going on, all coalescing into one simple statement.

""For the love of- you just wanted to have Iron Blood food?!"" She asked in disbelief.

""Er... I mean, it is a bit more complex than that..."" Stormcat replied inching away from her superior.

""Oh! wait, you two are Valkyries visiting, aren't you?"" The girl manning the desk asked.

""I see... it makes sense. I hear you sometimes make a pilgrimage to the *Vaterland* , but I suppose it makes sense to want to come and visit *Mutter* if you happen to be here. And you should be hungry."" The girl said as she eyed the two of them.

Before hearing their responses, the girl checked a clipboard she had nearby, flipping the pages and nodding a few times to herself.

""Right now, both *Mutter* as well as *Herr* Bismarck are in a meeting with the commander, but they should probably arrive after lunch time"" She quickly stated going over any possible counter argument that Buggy could even come up with.

""You are free to remain here at the reception if you wish to. But If you are feeling peckish, Miss Thüringen should be practicing in the kitchen and she could be able to prepare something for you.""

""Yes, that would be ideal!"" Stormcat replied before Buggy could even say something.

""Understood, please follow me. My name is Georg Thiele, I´ll guide you to our kitchen."" The girl said, nodding at them in acknowledgement.

""Ah, nice to meet you. I am Stormcat, er... just Stormcat, I suppose."" Stormcat said.

""Nice to meet you, I am Buggy of the Eagle Union´s Valkyries"" Buggy managed to introduce herself, coming to a better known territory for her, quick and simple self introductions.

""Likewise"" The girl stated, she nodded marginally in response and turned around, making her way into the dorm building without waiting for a response.

Buggy wanted to explain that while she was in fact hungry, her main reason to visit the Iron Blood dorms within Azur Lane was not something as unseemly as wanting to taste their local food. She had no real counter argument at that, and while she frantically went over which arguments she could probably bring regarding such a thing, she continued following Stormcat and the IronBlood destroyer.

Her opportunity to explain herself became slimmer when she realized that they had already entered the kitchen within the dorms. She became immediately fixated on how big and tidy the place was, everything seemed like it had been cleaned purposefully with the intent to host visitors, or probably an inspection. Which was pretty much on point with what she had experienced of the people from Iron Blood.

Then again, an inspection was probably taking place already, as she noticed there were three more people in the place. One of them was dressed like a maid of sorts. Truth be told, Buggy had not had much exposure to the whole maid culture until she came to Azur Lane, where the exposure to such a thing had been above and beyond what she had thought possible.

Some of the royal Maids had made her wish she could make some, less than professional requests from then, on a more private setting. So all in all she found some trouble trying to concentrate whenever there was a group of maids working. And this time wasn't an exception as the low cuts, present around everywhere on their attires, had distracted her enough that yet another conversation had already started before she could fully realize it.

""Guttern morgen, Miss Gneisenau, Miss Scharnhost, Miss Thüringen, these girls are Valkyries visiting us, they have come to visit *Mutter*, and they also want some food.""

Without giving much else of an explanation, the Iron Blood girl simply nodded and made her way out of the kitchen while everyone else remained a little bit confused by the statements.

Once George had left the kitchen everyone looked at each other as if trying to make sense of what had happened, as if the others had more information about what was taking place.

And one of them decided then that was how things must actually be like.

""You are Valkyries then, correct?"" A tall Iron Blood woman asked them.

Buggy was once again surprised by how different each Kansen seemed to be, as well as how bold they could be regarding their attires.

In front of her stood an Iron Blood Kansen with striking blue eyes framed by professional-looking red-rimmed-glasses, long straight lilac-colored hair, wearing a cap, part of her uniform of dark blue color with red accents, if it could be called an uniform, really. She wore rather small shorts, and thigh highs, a jacked that seemed like a pointless piece of wardrobe as it both exposed her midriff as well as her shoulders, and her sizeable chest was barely contained held by a white shirt that was once again fully exposed by the jacket.

""Buggy, you are staring too much again"" Stormcat chided softly at her companion, bringing her out of her daze.

""Ma'am! I am sorry, I didn't mean to stare but if only respectfully!"" Buggy quickly babbled as she stood at attention.

""It is all fine."" the other girl sitting beside that particular Kansen answered. ""While most would readily assume it is improper, we won't easily shy away from someone willing to appreciate fine Iron Blood engineering.""

""You are completely fine-eh-Right!! You are completely right ma'am!."" Buggy quickly replied, composing herself mid sentence as best as she could.

The second Kansen was apparently related to the first, with the same build, same hair color, and similar uniform just slightly different on some parts, covering more of her body and yet somehow displaying much more at the same time. but most notable on her was an eyepatch covering her left eye.

""I think we might be teasing her too much as it is,"" The third Iron Blood Kansen in the room said, one with calm blue eyes and long gray hair, being for some reason dressed like a maid.

""Yes. Please, let's just disregard my friend while she overcomes her sudden bout of shyness."" Stormcat said with a grin to her face.

""Wait no! dont disregard me-!.. a-bah ba- I mean!"" Buggy tried to complain about the implication of her getting shy around the Kansen, but she only managed to fumble her own words in a majestic fashion ending up covering her face for a couple of seconds trying to hide her blushing face while she put one finger up, indicating for everyone else to give her a few moments to compose herself.

""While that is comical enough, it would probably be for the best to make note it would be on her best interest that she doesn't meet Eugen, or she will risk most of her vocab being teased out of her"" One of the two sisters said, the one with glasses, stating it in a matter-of-fact way, to which the other Iron Blood Kansen simply agreed by nodding in acknowledgement.

""Anyway, I am Scharnhorst, this is my sister Gneisenau and this is Thüringen."" The Iron Blood girl with the eyepatch introduced each one as she signaled at them with her hand, with each one nodding minutely in response.

It was obvious she was done with their introductions as they looked intently at Stormcat and Buggy.

Stormcat had enough experience dealing with Iron Blood people to be able to pick on such a cue, she looked at Buggy who had recovered enough to seem at least ready to introduce herself properly if left to her own devices, and probably if left alone with people with less distracting attires.

""This is Buggy, and I am Stormcat, both of the Eagle Union Valkyries."" She introduced both of them in a simple manner, signaling each one of them.

""Oh? At first I thought you were a Tiger, but that doesn't seem to be the case at all."" Gneisenau said as she fixed her glasses and looked at Stormcat with a much more appreciative look.­ ""So tell me, what brings you to the Iron Blood dorms? You don't seem to be Zealous enough about your origin to be looking for Miss Freiderich, nor *Herr* Bismarck.""

""Well yeah, that would be interesting in itself, I suppose, with our origins and all that."" Stormcat said as much while shrugging in a noncommittal fashion.

""I am here for the food."" Stormcat stated, again.

""What do you even mean with that?!"" Buggy exclaimed, once again bothered by such a statement coming from her friend.

""You have heard before how important it is for the Tigers back home to come and meet Miss Friederich and Miss Bismarck! This is kind of disrespectful!"" Even though Buggy wanted to shout at her friend due to how wrong all this situation seemed to her, she managed to keep her voice low, and she even managed to somehow whisper the last part of her statement.

""I mean, we are proud of food, so we can probably just indulge your request, even if it's a little odd."" Thüringen, the maidly dressed Iron Blood Kansen said as she eyed Stormcat.­

""Oh really?! Thank you! Now I'll really know if Emma and Emilia are pulling my tail about their food being actually great or if they are just pranking me with their bad rations.""

She said as much, as she looked at her friend with a pleased look on her face, nonetheless she failed to notice that everyone else in the room had a look of confusion on their faces.

""Wait, what do you mean by their bad rations? Iron Blood rations? Is that why you are here?"" Buggy all but hissed back at her friend.

""Eh? I mean, yeah, a couple of our companions back home are two Tigers, sent there as part of the Valkyrie exchange system and what not"" Stormcat said matter-of-factly, as she more or less gave her answer as a simple explanation to everyone in the room.

""Wait, two Tigers have shared their rations with you? Iron Blood Valkyrie Tigers?!"" Scharnhorst asked with a look of disbelief on her face.

""I mean, yeah? There are two Tiger Valkyries on base, I often get teamed with them because they seem to respond positively to me, I think?. Tough girls, just seem like their responses to most things are too intense at times."" Stormcat said as she shrugged her shoulders.

""Like, at the end of missions they would make a point of making a campfire and heat up some of their rations. They would constantly brag about how the real dish, *'from the vatherland'* would be so much better while giving us canned stuff that I could barely palate."" She said as she pantomimed the gestures made by the Tiger Valkyries in question.

Stormcat continued explaining, completely blind to how the Kansen from the Iron Blood, as well as her own companion, were looking at her with astonishment evident on their faces.

""Er... I don't think I have ever been offered any of their rations"" Buggy said while looking at Stormcat who seemed agitated over the whole canned food situation.

""Actually I don't think I have heard of anyone else being offered some of their stuff"" Buggy commented softly as she pondered on the issue.

 

Everyone remained quiet as the statements seemed to confuse everyone in the room, even Stormcat who wasn't aware that no one else had tried the Iron Blood rations.

""You must be a hell of a fighter then!"" Scharnhorst loudly stated as she crossed her arms, breaking the silence that had fallen onto the room, looking at Stormcat with a whole different look on her face, evidently reevaluating her opinion of the Valkyrie in front of her.

""Eh?!"" Stormcat said intelligently, looking like a cat startled by the IronBlood girl raising her voice. Her two tufts of hair, which resembled cat ears, also flopped backwards in response to her surprise.

""They must really appreciate you."" Her sister Gneisenau added, accommodating her glasses as she looked intently at Stormcat and Buggy, stopping if only to look at Thüringen and nodding at her, part of some interaction that went completely over the Valkyries heads.

""Ok then, I suppose this would be a great opportunity to put my skills to the test. But with things as they are, I am thinking we should also call for Nurnberg."" Thüringen said in response to Gneisenau's meaningful look at her.

""That seems like the right thing to do. No offense meant to you, Thüringen. You are quite accomplished at this, but Nurnberg really has a way to bring the flavour of the fatherland onto any dish."" Geneisenau said.

""None taken, I know what you mean. I don't intend to presume I can bring the best to the table, and I am quite happy knowing my skills are developing. I wish I was able to bring some of the 'old flavours' I remember to everyone, but until I reach a decent enough level, I am happy to continue practicing.""

""Now if you will excuse me, ill go for her then."" Thüringen said, making a minute curtsy while holding her attire, leaving without much fanfare.

""Now, come sit, I will serve you some good beer. Iron Blood cuisine is meant to be served warm and with a cold drink on hand."" Scharnhorst said as she stood up and started looking at the cabinets within the kitchen.

""heh, they have said as much before."" Stormcat said as she took a seat that had been offered by Gneisenau, with Buggy following suit next to her

""Hah! They must really like you."" Scharnhorst said with a rather jovial tone to her as she continued going over the kitchen, now holding two tall glasses intended for their drinks. 

""You should probably remain at the dorm until Miss Friederich comes back, she will surely want to hear from your interactions with Emma and Emilia. Really, she is always delighted when she hears something from her 'Valkyrie daughters' """,1,1733633006.0,Azurlanefanfics,0,1.0,False

How can I move past these feelings?","I (M28) had given up on dating and relationships after a horrible abusive relationship where they wound up cheating on me. I was so hurt I didn't want to feel that way again.

I met this really sweet girl at the local barber, and we chatted a lot when I'd come in. Over the year I'd see her, she seemed flirty and trying to keep me later with free service. A few chances I felt came up where it seemed like she was expecting me to ask her out and I couldn't do it. 

I decided I needed to try or else I would regret it. The next time I saw her, she left it all out. She kept stopping the haircut to show me pictures from her sister's wedding, photos of her at the wedding, and some food she made. She also told me after I did something embarrassing that her dad did something embarrassing and it was how her mom knew he was, ""the one"". I asked a question about the wedding and her catching the bouquet, she said that she was done with dating. But I decided to ask for her Instagram and she excitedly wrote it down.

I asked her out for coffee and she wanted to do ice cream. She warned me she was busy with school, work and church. So initially she said she wasn't available that week then said she was on Friday after work. We agreed on a place and she waited until the day of to tell me when she was off. She was like, ""okay I'm off, you available in 15 minutes?"". 

We had our date and everything seemed to go well. We talked a lot, we laughed and we both seemed invested. Her friends showed up and she went to talk to them and then came back. She brought up she dated someone at a place I used to work at and she was very quiet and looked down at one point. We finished our date and we said we should go out again and she gave me a full hug and we left.

The following night, I asked her for a dinner date. Which she responded saying I was super nice and sweet but she didn't want to waste my time or money and that she didn't see it going anywhere and apologized.

I figured this would happen, she is Mormon and very Mormon at that based on her Instagram. I am not, so I naturally assumed that was the reason. I just told her it was okay, I appreciated she was honest and hoped that everything would work out for her and that I had enjoyed our time out. She liked the message and that was it. But she didn't unfollow me or say she wanted to be friends.

For the next 5 months, she would watch my Instagram stories and usually be one of the first. She would sometimes post a story and then watch mine right after I watched hers. Then she abruptly stopped watching mine and I never saw her post another story and had a feeling she restricted me. Yet she still followed me.

I was kinda confused about everything. Throughout and from the start it felt like mixed signals. How she flirted but said done with dating. She wasn't available then she was. She wanted to go out again, but then didn't see it going anywhere. Then kept watching my stories. She didn't specify anything either.

I never went back to that barber cause I didn't want to make it uncomfortable for her. After 6 months, I hadn't heard from her so I decided to block her on Instagram. Nothing out of spite, it was cause I was disappointed and I didn't want to see her move along cause I know Mormons do.

I've not been able to escape this ""what if"" feeling and some guilt for just blocking her. It was the first person I dated and the most excited I felt about someone in a very long time. We had a connection and it seemed mutual. She put herself out there at work to make it clear.

I've considered unblocking her or going back to the barber, but it still sucks. It felt like I had a chance with a super sweet girl and it just sucks cause it think her faith blocked it.

(TLDR; I made a connection with a super sweet girl and went out with her. It was my first date since the end of an abusive relationship 2 years prior. She put herself out there at work to get me to ask her out. The date went well, but she said it wasn't going anywhere afterwards. She's Mormon and I'm not, so that's probably the reason why. But she kept following my Instagram and watched stories for months before I decided to just block her. She seemed super interested but there were mixed signals about dating, our date plans and if we'd go out again. I can't stop wondering ""what if"" and have some guilt.)",0,1733632872.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

This play chronicles a family’s Christmas dinner over the course of several decades. As time passes we see the family deal with both good news and bad, both grow and retract…and retract. Visual and audio cues chime in to denote the passage of time, though I didn’t personally find the transitions hard to follow. 

While there’s some humor here and there this is a somewhat heavy play despite its lean 75 minute runtime. I enjoyed it quite a bit and I feel that its themes can resonate with anyone that has had multiple family gatherings (holiday or otherwise) over the years. Yeah, holiday gatherings can be a fun time but it’s just as often sad, or dipped in interpersonal drama. 

The long Christmas dinner is running til December 29 at the Bramble Arts Loft, a new(!) theater venue in Andersonville, right next to the understudy, a great little coffee shop/theater bookshop.

1h9avr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/InnerEfficiency/comments/1h9avr8/how_to_create_a_morning_routine_that_works_your/,How to Create a Morning Routine That Works: Your Blueprint for a Productive Day,"Imagine starting your day not with a frantic rush and a gulp of coffee, but with **intention**, **energy**, and a sense of calm control. A well-crafted morning routine isn’t just a luxury — it’s a powerful tool for personal transformation, productivity, and mental well-being. In a world where we’re constantly bombarded with distractions and demands, a strategic morning routine can be your secret weapon for success.

# Why Morning Routines Matter

Successful people across industries — from CEOs to artists, athletes to entrepreneurs — share one common denominator: they understand the magic of a purposeful morning. Your morning sets the tone for your entire day, acting as a psychological and physiological reset button that can dramatically impact your productivity, mood, and overall life satisfaction.

Let’s consider a typical professional scenario: Imagine a marketing executive struggling with chronic stress and inconsistent productivity. By implementing a structured morning routine, they might experience a dramatic shift:

**A Potential Morning Routine:**

* Waking up at 5:30 AM
* Practicing 20 minutes of meditation
* Completing a 30-minute workout
* Enjoying a nutritious breakfast
* Dedicating time to goal-setting and journaling

**Potential Outcomes:**

* Increased personal energy
* Improved mental clarity
* Enhanced professional performance
* Better work-life balance

Consider a freelance writer battling morning procrastination and creative blocks. A redesigned morning might look like:

**A Possible Approach:**

* Rising at 6:00 AM
* Practicing gratitude journaling
* Taking a short, reflective walk
* Writing for one uninterrupted hour before checking emails

**Potential Benefits:**

* Heightened creative output
* Reduced morning anxiety
* More consistent work habits
* Increased professional satisfaction

>

# Crafting Your Ideal Morning Routine

# Understanding Your Natural Rhythms

The secret isn’t about copying someone else’s routine, but **discovering what works uniquely for you**. Some people are morning larks, while others are night owls. Pay attention to your body’s natural energy cycles. When do you feel most alert? What times spark your creativity? When does your energy naturally peak?

# Building Your Routine: A Gentle Approach

Transformation doesn’t happen overnight. Start small and build gradually. Choose one or two **micro-habits** that feel manageable:

* Wake up just 15 minutes earlier
* Drink a full glass of water immediately upon waking
* Spend five minutes stretching your body

# Designing an Energizing Morning

Your ideal routine should be a blend of activities that **nourish your body**, **stimulate your mind**, and **align with your personal and professional aspirations**. Think of it as a personalized recipe for daily success.

# Practical Implementation Strategies

# Taming Technology

In our hyper-connected world, technology can be both a blessing and a curse. During your morning routine, consider keeping your phone in airplane mode. Create a sacred space free from digital interruptions that can derail your focus and intention.

# Overcoming Common Challenges

The “I’m not a morning person” excuse is one we’ve all used. But here’s the truth: **becoming a morning person is a skill you can learn**. Gradually adjust your sleep schedule, create a compelling reason to wake up, and make your first-morning activity something you genuinely look forward to.

# Conclusion: Your Morning, Your Masterpiece

Crafting a morning routine is a journey of **self-discovery and personal growth**. There’s no universal blueprint, but with experimentation, patience, and commitment, you can design a morning that becomes the launchpad for extraordinary days.

**Remember:** It’s not about perfection. It’s about progress.

So when I was a kid, my mother, my sister & I all moved out to Hawaii to see my mother's friend that lived out there. We packed our things & headed to the tropical paradise. While sitting on the plane, my mother had all of our money we were gonna use to start our lives out there in the form of cashiers checks, in her zipped up wallet, in the bottom of her carry on. We landed, we were all pretty tired from the flight, so we thought we'd go get some coffee at the airport. We walk for a bit, then we see a big round table outside of a coffee shop & my mother starts frantically looking through her carry on & then dumps the contents out onto the table we were all sitting at. The money was GONE. To this day, we never recovered the money & have no idea how someone was able to steal it. 

That's story one. 

Story two. 

We've been living in Hawaii for about a year or so at this point. We ended up moving in with my mother's friend, due to all our money getting stolen on the flight there. 
My sister & I absolutely loved walking around the dried lava fields, exploring the caves that it would form. We were so adventurous, we would walk around everywhere. We didn't even wear shoes, no one really does over there.
So, on one of our fun adventures, we stop at this field with very tall grass/weeds. We stop for a second & take in the sight of just how beautiful everything was, when all of a sudden we see this top hat bouncing in & out of sight on the top of the grass/weeds. In front of whatever we were seeing were two ferrets, one white, one black. We were stunned.. we had no idea what we were witnessing. We run back to the house to tell our mother what happened. 
Back then, my mother was an avid listener of a very popular radio show called NPR. Seeing what this subreddit is about, y'all probably know what it is or most likely at least heard of it. 
We were all laying down, ready to go to bed. As we were telling our mother what we saw just a couple hours before, NPR is quietly playing the background. We hear someone call in & they tell the host something they saw that day & they explained to a T, exactly what my sister & I saw earlier. We all couldn't believe it. We all instantly thought, ""no wayyyy"", but nope, it was real.

My husband spent his Saturday thus: breakfast, shower, change, put some clothes in the wash, head out around 8 to run an errand. Took 1 hour. Snake the shower drain. Game until noon. Eat lunch. Game until 4:23, come downstairs and then retreat again when he saw I was mopping. Game until 5-something, come downstairs and embroider with the TV on. Finish embroidering and watch TV/scroll until dinner (except for the 2 minutes he got up to feed the dog) around 7:30, eat, sit and wait for me to come watch a movie. He took the dog out to pee before bed. Pretty chill yeah? Few things to do but mostly nothing. 

My Saturday: get up at 6am, walk the dog and feed her, work on allocating my paycheck next week, table that, then chill until he brings my car back at 9:15-ish. Get dressed and head out to do grocery shopping. While I drive I call my mother to finalize their plans to visit this week. Shop, put gas in the car, come home and carry all the bags in myself. Put groceries away, heat up lunch for myself and eat really quick. Sit down and deal with some bills coming due next week. When that's done, I have my first coffee in three days because we were out of creamer. Then clean up my kitchen, swiffer the floors so I can mop, then mop the entire downstairs, which should have been done this week when I cleaned that day I worked from home because we have house guests coming, but left for as late as possible because between the snow and the dog I didn't want to do it twice.  Go to start the linen laundry, which we're out of, and oh wait! He never finished his clothes. So I have to dry and fold his clothes before doing the things everyone uses. That done I work on some things I need to line up for school in January. Walk the dog, which is a production right now since it started snowing, then come inside and bake the loaf I usually do every week or else we have no quick breakfasts to grab before leaving for work in office the mornings we go since we have a 90 minute commute, then we wind up getting Dunkin' which fucks up both up. As soon as that's done, I tend to the full sink of dishes which could only be half done because we have a huge sink, no dishwasher, and small drying area. This has historically been his only designated in-house chore aside from managing his own clothes.  I did ALL the thanksgiving dishes last week because he'd do a couple, not bother with any cutlery, and then we have nothing to eat with. All the towels are in the wash to expand the drying space so I just stop there. Finish the loaf, start on dinner, serve around 7:30. Pack leftovers and clean up everything except the stove because that's still hot so my kitchen is a mess again until whenever I get to it. And instead of studying for my stats final I sit and watch a Christmas movie with him because i want the time to connect. He went to bed, and I've been studying. And that laundry never got finished. 

I am not a housewife. I work 40 hours a week, as of January will be in school or doing homework 7 hours a week, and just got a request to take over for a volunteer coordinator (which I may or may not take, not sure yet) 8 hours a week fulfilling some undergrad gaps before grad school. When we discussed me changing my career path we talked about him having to cook more, pick up a couple extra chores here and there while i work on changing course, and he told me no problem. Lately he's just been so LAZY. He games hours a day. I'm talking before 4pm he works from home until about 630, which isn't that bad, but then it's all. weekend. long. There's shit to do and he spends the equivalent of a work day gaming on weekends. This doesn't include TV time. Normally I don't care, do you when there's nothing going on, but today was a great example of I did a shit ton of stuff, and all I got was a ""you did a lot today"" after clearing up after dinner. I'd love to have a day when I had absolutely nothing to do. That's not an option for me. 

I am concerned about when school starts. He seems to be thinking last couple times we talked that it's just handling dinner 2 nights a week because I'll be late getting home. Even if that was true here's the thing: he's going to want to try new recipes. It sweet, he wants to expand what he knows how to make for me and to his credit he's a very good home cook when he does it, but that means a shit ton of ingredients to buy because he doesn't omit or substitute EVER, then he's going to complain about the increased grocery bill. So I'm still going to have to manage his plans on those two days anyway. And if it's a regular recipe of ours? If it's not one of the 5 things he already make he asks me a question every 2 minutes. If the card doesn't specify 'diced onion' but you know is a sauce, you know what to do for it, you don't need me. I'm worried me going to school and relying on him like he insists I can is going to lead to piled up laundry, a grimy house, an unwalked dog, an out of control grocery budget, and vermin from the standing water in the sink dishes.

He's not usually a dirty person, and not usually a lazy person. But these things are just not things he cares about. Laundry doesn't bother him until it's completely out. Dishes don't bother him until there's nothing left. The house could be cluttered and grimy and he'll be fine until there's a problem. When he does things he does them well. It's getting to the point that he feels the need that I can't handle. 

I just wish he could just look around, see the need, and do what needs to get done, but lately he's been complaining about everything and today was just straight up unhelpful. I mean, the first time he noticed the problem I was bringing his second load of folded laundry upstairs and by then I'd just rather do everything myself because I'm almost done anyway. 

I'm worried to start the spring semester. Not because I can't handle it but because I'm worried he won't handle it. Maybe it's the recent snow storm and him shoveling the drive, maybe it's work related, something. He's the kindest, gentlest, most supportive person I've ever met, I'm not leaving him, and we will discuss this when I'm not so pissy about it but like...come on. One of these days you're going to have to associate the dryer no longer shaking the entire house and drowning out normal conversational volume with your laundry being done, right? 

TLDR: i'm about to start school to chase my dreams with his encouragement and pledge of help, but lately he can't seem to help even when life isn't crazy yet. I'm concerned everything is going to fall apart with me having to rely on him more for home management. ",2,1733631612.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Not anymore the new asst director has been there for about a year and since the actual director works mostly remote she has free reign
 She HATES kids. She ruined the summer reading program by majorly downsizing it all of the in library programs are now adult only (they literally have signs stating do not bring kids younger than 18 in on multiple days of the week) and now the kids section is shrinking A LOT!

I'd heard from some other former patrons that she kept charging them for items that were damaged so they stopped attending I didn't think much of it until it started happening to me too. I rent a lot of books usually but don't always have time to read them all so sometimes they just stay in my book bag. Well I'd return them and then 2-3 months later after multiple visits be told of these items were damaged by the way the books I was being charged for were old and already damaged but I paid anyways. It kept happening though and I've had enough now. 

The asst. Director now wants me to pay $12 for a book that was 5+ years old outdated (due to it being a tech book the info is outdated) that shed been wanting to replace anyways and since I was the last to rent the book 6 months ago I obviously damaged it. This book never left my bag
 The kicker is I watched her put it on display after I returned it. When she showed me the damaged book it looked awful like someone purposely wrinkled all the pages and spilled coffee all over it. Now I've gladly paid for the occasional item that I might have damaged or replaced it with a new copy but this is ridiculous.
