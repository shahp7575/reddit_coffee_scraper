1mvj6df,https://i.redd.it/0paelue687kf1.jpeg,AIO: Cousin messing up my house,"I don’t know if I’m overreacting so I’d appreciate some feedback!! My older cousin came to stay over for a week from France. My new place is a studio, but super small since I’m renting out my other place for some extra income. 

I have a double bed, a pull out couch so there is plenty of place for her to sleep and she chose the pull out bed. I like a quiet and clean space to live in, and I understand not everyone follows the same cleanliness standards so I’m more lenient when I have guests but some things have happened that have just sent me over the edge. 

First of all, the place is a mess. She doesn’t want to make her bed up during the day, or fold it back into a couch so there’s more space. I’ve been making her bed for her, and she asked me to do that so I said “just this time” and did it. That was 3 days ago and she expects me to do it everyday. She even said “I’m out of bed if you can do your thing when I’m in the shower that’s great”. She leaves my brand new towels on the floor, and her curly hair everywhere. I’ve asked her not to eat in bed because this is London, mice will appear if you’re not careful, and I found crumbs all over the floor and her bedsheets, as well as two crushed bugs in the bed. She leaves makeup fingerprints all over the mirror, bathroom sink and even the wall beside the full length mirror. She leaves her iced latte glass cups on the floor. Yes, I’ve spoken to her about it and she shrugs it off. 

Today, she went to visit a museum and I was in the shower. When I came out of the shower, she was gone already and there was a pool of coffee on the kitchen floor with a handful of paper towels just thrown on top of it and coffee splatter on the wall as well as the glass cup for the coffee with a massive crack down the side and the glass straw shattered still left in the sink, a leftover Tupperware of rice on her bed with a rice-y spoon on the blanket beside it and rice scattered on the blanket too. There were crumpled up booger tissues just in the bed as well. 

She also speaks on the phone very loudly on FaceTime with several men I don’t know, and tries to make me say hi even though I am a hijabi so I can’t show them my hair and they laugh about it. Yesterday, she referred to me as “autistic Annie” (my name isn’t Annie, nor am I autistic) because I came back from the grocery store to find a packet of sour candy spilled all over my kitchen counter with the sugar granules everywhere on the floor and one of my chia potted plants knocked over and soil everywhere, and I said “this isn’t acceptable! Can you help me clean NOW?” and I started to clean. It made me feel embarrassed and ashamed. 

Something that has also deeply hurt me is that we’re Arab, and I take great pride in my culture and belongings and I inherited a beautiful traditional middle eastern blanket / couch throw from my grandma and she used it to wrap her dirty laundry in and now it has an odor to it. 

I don’t know if I’m being too picky or too unfair. I genuinely don’t know. She told me to “chill out” when I tried to talk to her about it. ",1,1755706282.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

1mvj4i6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1mvj4i6/explore_the_best_wood_pellet_smoker_grill_in_the/,Explore the best wood pellet smoker grill in the Recteq DualFire 1200,"Testing out the recteq DualFire has been an experience that’s hard to forget, and that’s coming from someone who grills year-round. Let me start by saying, this is no ordinary smoker. The dual-chamber design immediately caught my attention. Anything that lets you sear steaks at high heat in one chamber while slow-smoking ribs at a precise and steady temperature in another is a game-changer. I've tried both chambers extensively, and honestly, it feels like having two professional-grade outdoor cookers rolled into one unit. The moment it arrived, I knew I was in for something serious — the stainless steel construction just oozes durability, and its sleek appearance silently screams, “I’m built to withstand the elements.”

The real magic, though, lies in its precision. I dialed the temperature down to 180°F to smoke a brisket overnight, and the results were insane. The PID controller kept the temperature rock-solid for hours, which meant I got to enjoy my Saturday morning coffee without constantly checking on the smoker. Cranking it up to 700°F for pizza night with the kids was just as impressive! It's not just a grill; it's a versatile cooking station. 

**Strong Points**

- Dual-chamber design allows simultaneous searing and smoking.  
- Temperature ranges from 180°F to 700°F offer unmatched versatility for grilling, smoking, or even baking.  
- Made from high-grade stainless steel, ensuring durability and resistance to weather-related wear.  

[Check recteq DualFire 1200 price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b0ckj8yz94/)

While the functionality blew me away, there are a few quirks I had to learn to work around. For one, this grill is massive — which is great in terms of cooking capacity, but it also meant finding a permanent setup space in my backyard. At over 200 pounds, portability isn’t exactly one of its features. And although the industry-leading warranties and customer service gave me peace of mind, I wondered why a cover for the grill wasn't included in the package. It feels like something you’d expect with a product in this price range.

**Negative Attributes**

- Bulkiness makes it unsuitable for small patios or frequent repositioning.  
- Does not include a grill cover, which would have been a nice addition at this price.  

Beyond the basics, the Wi-Fi connectivity stood out as a feature I didn’t expect to love as much as I do. Using my phone, I could monitor and adjust the temperature while multitasking inside the house. I even received notifications during longer smokes, which meant no guesswork about when to wrap or pull the meat. It’s especially handy for someone as forgetful as me when I get busy entertaining guests. Pairing the app felt straightforward, but it occasional tweaks were needed for initial stability — a minor hiccup I quickly got over given how well the rest of the system works.

When comparing it to some of the other heavyweights in the combination grill-smoker market, I couldn’t help but think of the Traeger Timberline series. Both grills cater to those looking for versatility and high-tech features, but in my opinion, the DualFire takes the edge for sheer cooking space and dual-chamber innovation that lets you experiment with multiple techniques that other units simply don’t. On the flip side, Traeger’s app seems to load slightly faster, and they have more seasoning and pellet variety.

The price for a smoker of this caliber might raise some eyebrows at first, but hear me out. If you're serious about outdoor cooking and want a grill that can handle everything from tailgates to full-blown summer BBQ parties, the investment starts to make sense. I’ve owned cheaper grills in the past, and while they got the job done, the uneven heating, small cooking surface, and rust-prone build eventually cost me more than I saved. The DualFire feels like it’s built for the long haul.

1mvj3q7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvj3q7,Found some series 1 drinks in the wild.,"Was out shopping today and in one of my regular food shops I thought I’d take walk down their toy aisle as they can sometimes be a bit hit and miss when it comes to Miniverse. Anyway all they seemed to have were the Makeup series and Diner 3 so strolled away and then I spotted a tiny box with Miniverse markings and it said Drinks! I’ve been collecting Miniverse for about 1.5 years now and the early series drinks have never really been available, even though I’m in the UK and our recall was nowhere near as bad the rest of the world, so I was excited to add more drinks to my collection because tbh, they’re kinda my fave as they’re easy and hard to mess up! Pulled up the good ol’ meenyminimo and checked the list, now there are only 6 different options available and 5 balls in the box. 3 of them were what they were and the other 2 were dupes. I debated whether to get them or not anyway but tbh, for what they are, a single drink, they were pretty expensive! They were marked at £5.35. So decided to just get one of each, which were Berry Refresher, Ube Boba and a Mocha. Anyway, just wanted to share incase anyone else finds these oldies out in the wild. Used more ice than I should have in my Mocha cause I’m kinda having an iced coffee summer so it seemed more appropriate. Got them in Tesco for anyone in 🇬🇧 who might be looking! Oh and one last thing, it was *insane* how tiny the balls were lol. I’m now annoyed at having these tiny balls of plastic to recycle. ",3,1755706128.0,miniverse_makeitmini,1,0.8,False
1mvj2ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToolboxTruth/comments/1mvj2ii/explore_the_best_power_tool_combo_kit_milwaukee/,Explore the Best Power Tool Combo Kit Milwaukee Has to Offer Today,"The Milwaukee 2498-25 is the power tool combo kit I recently brought into the mix of my DIY arsenal, and let me tell you, it has been quite the experience. Putting this 5-tool combo kit through its paces, I felt a mix of both excitement and trepidation because, let’s face it, power tools need to deliver, especially if you're someone who consistently works on challenging projects like I do. This versatile kit included some heavy hitters: a drill/driver, impact driver, Hackzall reciprocating saw, ratchet, and an LED worklight. With tools like these, I dove into crafts, repairs, and even some ambitious woodworking plans. 

**Design and Portability**  
One of the most appealing aspects here is how compact the tools are despite their strong performance. Milwaukee’s design really seems to cater to those who value mobility without sacrificing power. Trust me, I’ve squeezed myself into the tightest of spaces while doing repair work on old furniture and fixtures in dimly lit corners, and the size and ergonomic grips of the tools were a lifesaver. The power-to-size ratio of this combo kit is beyond convenient—everything from the drill driver to the Hackzall feels like it's designed with both amateurs and pros in mind. 

**Performance and Capability**  
Performance speaks volumes, and this lineup delivers. Each tool—whether it’s the hex impact driver with its torque of 1,000 in-lbs or the Hackzall with its variable speed of up to 3,000 SPM—felt robust during use. Do I need to mention how satisfying it is to slice through dense materials with the Hackzall in seconds? My projects have sped up significantly because I’m not scrambling to switch between incompatible tools. With these, cutting metal, fastening screws, and even boring through concrete feels surprisingly efficient.  

[Ready to snag Milwaukee 2498-25? See Amazon’s price.](https://toolsmaestro.com/p/b0bjj96cc1/)

**Battery Life and Charging System**  
No matter how great a tool lineup is, a poor battery can ruin everything. Luckily, Milwaukee’s REDLITHIUM battery technology holds up well. Two 1.5Ah battery packs come included with the combo, and I found they last ample time even during marathon work sessions. Whether I was constructing that new DIY coffee table or rewiring fixtures, I didn’t have to pause too frequently for recharging. The charger, compact yet fast, is a solid bonus. However, during heavier usage, you might find that an additional higher-capacity battery is a smarter long-term investment.

**Strengths**  
- Compact and ergonomic design suited for tight spaces.  
- Versatile tool selection for multiple tasks/projects.  
- Strong performance metrics with reliable torque and SPM values.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Original batteries are suited for moderate usage but struggle in intensive projects.  
- No storage compartments inside the bag for better organization.  
- LED light lacks certain brightness adjustments that more premium worklights feature.  

**Versatility and Usage**  
Each tool in this set feels designed for maximum adaptability. For instance, the ratchet worked fantastically on an automotive repair I assisted with. The drill driver, lightweight yet packed with torque, breezed through a DIY birdhouse project I worked on with my nephew. I even used the LED light in my garage one evening when fixing a shelving unit, and its magnetic back ensured hands-free functionality. Though the tools are versatile, it’s clear they cater to users from DIY enthusiasts to construction workers juggling home improvements to professional tasks.  

**Other Options**  
Choosing a combo kit can be tricky, especially when compared to market rivals like DeWalt’s DCK594P2 or Ryobi’s ONE+ system. While Milwaukee shines in portability and ease of use, others might offer extra user-friendly accessories like storage systems or slightly more powerful batteries. From what I’ve tested, Milwaukee’s set seems best suited to individuals needing high portability without losing power—it’s very much about balance rather than dominance in one category.

**Quality for Price**  
Is it financially worth it? That’s what I wondered after using it intensively. The tools deliver as promised, but buyers must weigh whether they’ll use each component to its full extent regularly. While the price isn’t the cheapest in the market, it’s clear you’re paying for durability and precision, not entries that underperform or break quickly. Each tool has practical value over time.

1mvj2a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1mvj2a0/publicly_expose_only_location_api_used_by_the/,Publicly expose only location API used by the phone apps?,"Like many I am not to thrilled about exposing HomeAssistant publicly. I have everything behind a reverse proxy even internally and that is running on a different physical machine, so the risk is fairly limited, however the potential fallout also is pretty big with indoor security cameras etc. being available to Home Assistant.

I have a VPN set up to access everything while away so there isn't really a need to expose anything, with one exception: if I forget that I was switched to a different VPN on my phone or if the VPN doesn't work for some reason, when I leave, Home Assistant doesn't know about this and still thinks I'm home.

It looks like the zone feature has no fail safe for when a device doesn't check in for a while, it completely relies on every user / device checking in with a location. I know there are other options to track presence, but I am planning to rely more on the distance to home and whether people are coming or leaving e.g. to keep the AC on if I'm just a mile away grabbing a quick coffee, but turn it off when I am 20 miles away.

So here's my actual question: has anybody looked into potentially only exposing the API endpoints that are required for the app to successfully authenticate and report its status in the background? In my mind I would do something like allowing only POST requests of very specific api endpoints and block everything else externally.

Maybe this is overkill, but that's what we are all here for, isn't it?",0,1755706042.0,homeassistant,0,0.5,False

# Colossians 3:17

* *And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.*

If we belong to Christ in heaven, our lives here on earth should reflect that heavenly life.

Our prayer is, “Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” So we must put to death all the things in our lives that are wrong or that don’t belong in heaven. This includes all desires, actions, and attitudes that are not pure and righteous.

We are called to live in this world, surrounded by its evil, yet remain untainted by it. The list of things we are to cast aside is alarming. It may seem like we would never be tempted to do these things, but the danger is always present.

There are also things we are told to “put on,” and these are all beautiful—compassion, kindness, humility, and meekness. We should keep this list close, where we can see it every day.

1mviwrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToysAndTots/comments/1mviwrx/screenfree_activities_for_babies_012_months/,Screen-Free Activities for Babies (0–12 Months),"Babies under 12 months learn best through touch, sound, movement, and human interaction not through screens. Studies show that babies under 3 don’t learn well from TV or phones (this is called the **“video deficit effect”**). Too much screen time can affect language skills, attention, and even emotional development later on.

The good news? Babies *love* real-world experiences. Even the simplest games, singing, reading, or letting them feel different textures build strong brain connections. And you don’t need fancy toys. A spoon, scarf, or cardboard box often works better than anything with batteries.

# Developmental Stages and Activities

Babies grow so quickly that their play needs change every few months. Below, you’ll find activities organized by age. Don’t worry if your baby is a little ahead or behind,these are guides, not strict rules.

# 0–3 Months: The Fourth Trimester

Babies are adjusting to life outside the womb. They love soothing voices, gentle touch, and womb-like rhythms.

|Activity|Why It Helps|How to Do It|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Read to Your Baby|Builds early language, soothes with your voice|Pick simple books with rhythm (nursery rhymes, short stories). Hold baby close and read slowly.|
|Sing or Hum|Reduces stress, builds bond|Sing lullabies, make up silly songs, or hum while rocking.|
|Walk with Baby|Gentle motion calms, exposes them to new sounds|Use a sling/carrier, narrate what you see.|
|Kangaroo Care|Skin-to-skin regulates heart, temp, and stress|Place baby (in diaper) on your bare chest under a blanket.|
|Tummy Time|Builds neck and shoulder strength|Place baby on tummy on a mat. Get down face-to-face and encourage them.|
|Mirror Play|Babies love faces|Use a baby-safe mirror during tummy time and talk to their reflection.|
|High-Contrast Patterns|Stimulates vision|Show black-and-white cards or bold stripes, 8–12 inches away.|

# 3–4 Months: Becoming More Alert

Babies start smiling, laughing, and showing interest in the world.

|Activity|Why It Helps|How to Do It|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dance with Baby|Combines music, motion, and bonding|Hold baby securely and sway to music with a steady beat.|
|Texture Play|Enhances sensory skills|Let baby touch soft blanket, smooth spoon, rough washcloth.|
|Play Comedian|Encourages laughter and emotional growth|Make silly faces, noises, or blow raspberries.|
|Encourage Kicking|Builds leg strength and teaches cause-effect|Tie soft rattles to ankles or let them kick a crinkly mat.|
|Texture Books|Combines touch + language|Use “touch and feel” baby books; guide their hands while you name textures.|

# 5–6 Months: Rolling, Babbling, Exploring

Babies are getting mobile and vocal.

|Activity|Why It Helps|How to Do It|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Finger Rhymes|Combines rhythm, gestures, and language|Do songs like *Itsy Bitsy Spider* with hand motions.|
|Encourage Rolling|Builds core strength|Place a toy just out of reach to one side.|
|Supported Sitting|Improves posture and perspective|Prop baby with pillows, place toys within reach.|
|Babble Conversations|Early language practice|Imitate their sounds, pause, and let them “reply.”|
|Peek-a-Boo|Teaches object permanence|Hide your face or a toy, then reveal with excitement.|

# 7–8 Months: Fine Motor Skills Developing

Now babies can grasp better, respond to words, and may start scooting or crawling.

|Activity|Why It Helps|How to Do It|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Self-Feeding|Builds independence + pincer grasp|Offer soft foods (banana pieces, peas) on tray.|
|Picture Books|Builds recognition + vocabulary|Choose books with big, real images. Point and name objects.|

# Bonus Activities (All Ages)

* **Sensory Bottles:** Fill a plastic bottle with water + glitter. Shake and watch.
* **Music Play:** Try different genres. Older babies can bang on drums or shakers.
* **Bubbles:** Blow bubbles; babies love tracking and popping them.
* **Obstacle Course:** Use pillows or cushions for crawling paths.
* **Puppet Play:** Puppets “talk” to baby, encouraging social interaction.

# Tips for Parents

* **Follow Baby’s Lead:** Stop if they look tired or fussy.
* **Keep It Short:** 5–10 minutes is enough for most activities.
* **Use Everyday Items:** No need for expensive toys. Scarves, spoons, or mirrors work.
* **Make It Routine:** Read before naps, sing during diaper changes, play peek-a-boo after feeding.
* **Involve Family:** Siblings and grandparents can join in.
* **Celebrate Small Wins:** Every babble, roll, or clap is a milestone worth cheering.

# Science Behind Play

* **Piaget (the “explorer” idea):** Babies don’t learn by sitting and listening. They learn by touching, mouthing, kicking, rolling, basically doing stuff. Every time your baby shakes a rattle or bangs a spoon, their brain is learning cause-and-effect. This is called the sensorimotor stage (birth to \~2 years).
* **Vygotsky (the “social learner” idea):** Babies learn best with other people. That’s why peek-a-boo, singing, or even talking back to their babbles helps them more than playing alone. He called this “social interaction driving learning.”
* **Erikson (the “trust” idea):** In the first year, babies are figuring out: “Can I trust the world?” When you respond to their cries, cuddle them, or smile back, they start believing “Yes, I’m safe, people take care of me.” That trust is the foundation for all later confidence and relationships.
* **Sensory Integration (the “multi-senses” idea):** Babies’ brains connect faster when more than one sense is involved. For example, when you sing (sound) while bouncing (movement) and showing a toy (sight), the brain gets stronger connections than from just one sense alone.

# Quick FAQ for Parents

**Q: My baby isn’t interested. Should I worry?**  
A: No, babies have short attention spans. Try again later or switch activities.

**Q: We don’t have many toys. What can I do?**  
A: Household items (spoons, scarves, boxes) work just as well.

**Q: Can’t I just use baby videos?**  
A: Screens hold attention but don’t build real skills. Babies need hands-on play to learn.",1,1755705718.0,ToysAndTots,0,1.0,False

Then procrastination shows up it starts innocently with just a few minutes on Reddit then a YouTube video then another before I know it my energy is gone.

The plan I made while brushing my teeth is forgotten the motivation I felt while pouring my coffee is gone and the morning of possibilities is gone already lost.

It's not laziness; it's fear disguised as procrastination so my mind chooses rest over courage hiding in dopamine loops of scrolling clicking and watching, instead of facing the work I truly care about.

1mviv10,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1mviv10/a_guide_to_the_crescents_and_room_types_at_four/,A guide to the crescents and room types at Four Seasons Hualalai,"This is a question I get in my inbox multiple times a week so I thought I'd do a knowledge share for everyone on our sub as well!

Understanding the crescents and rooms at FS Hualalai: which crescent is best suited to which traveler and which room types to book if you want a particular crescent is a whole game unto itself. 

# Background on the property & sections

Here is an overall resort map of the property to set the stage:

[The crescents are the four sections along the beach noted above](https://preview.redd.it/ja5g0egiy6kf1.png?width=1772&format=png&auto=webp&s=614b0d4afb834bb99d66d8d34762ae212045e2d2)

To provide some background, Four Seasons Hualalai is built along the beach with four crescent sections. The sections are called crescents because of their shape. Each crescent has it's own pool, it's own restaurants and it's own distinct vibe. People often have a very distinct preference for one over the other, which I'll get into more below. The pool is the focal point of each crescent with the rooms being dotted around it in a horseshoe shape. 

The four crescents are: 

1. King's Pond
2. Sea Shell
3. Beach Tree
4. Palm Grove 

Here's a closer view of those:

https://preview.redd.it/svsa1p1m37kf1.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=af1e6621b8ccc534dff53d4b7f70704ed42cadcd

The rooms on the crescents are located in different bungalow buildings as you can see dotted on the map. There are 37 bungalows on the property and each has an upper floor and a lower floor. There are certain room types which are more common in one crescent or another - more on that below. 

# How do I know which crescent I want to be in?

Like I said, each crescent has a vibe:

* **King's Pond** = King's Pond is my personal favorite because of how unique it is. You have this incredible infinity pool (part of that $100MM renovation) that sits above the actual King's Pond which is the resort's signature saltwater aquarium that you can swim and snorkel in. They have huge array of beautiful tropical fish and a resident eagle ray that is super friendly. You're obviously not supposed to touch any of the fish or the ray but that certainly doesn't stop him from coming by and touching you - which he very much does. He like to sidle up to his visitors. Also King's Pond is awesome because they have resident marine biologists on staff that have an outpost right on the pond where they conduct educational seminars and are around to answer any questions you have about the aquarium or the ocean in general. For an animal nerd like me, this spot is a favorite. Also to note: King's Pond is definitely family friendly, though it's much more low key so if you have kids that are going to be loud and rambunctious - it's best to stay at Sea Shell. The pool at KP is smaller, more low key and meant for lounging and hanging, not playing. 

* **Sea Shell** = This is the family friendly kids pool. The pool itself is built like a lagoon cove so there's lots of areas for the kids to explore and play in. This is the one that's louder and has a lot of action and a ton of kids and the place that will tire your kids out and let them make friends. It's sort of like it's own kids club in a way. It's also right in front of the Ocean Pool which is great because the kids can run back and forth to the beach. 

* **Beachtree** = This is the other explicitly family-friendly crescent but the one that's more low key. So if you want a kid friendly spot that's less rambunctious - this is your jam. It's also right on top of the breakfast restaurant, Beachtree and the lawn in front of the crescent is the primo spot for sunset photoshoots. Many a family Christmas card is taken here. 

* **Palm Grove** = the adults only section. It's suited for a romantic trip or a friends trip where you want a vibey yet low key pool situation with a fun swim up bar, this is your move. Plus you're right by Residence Beach House which is a great spot for a couple's or group dinner. 

One additional note is that it's important to consider your location preference. If you have super little kids and it takes forever to get them places, maybe you don't want to do King's Pond because you'd find it easier to be closer to the breakfast restaurant. 

# How do I choose my crescent?

Well that's the kicker. You can't, technically. However, you can optimize for it by choosing a room type that makes it more likely you will be in the crescent that you want and then ensure that you share your preference with the hotel or your TA. Half of my time with VIPs at Hualalai is just working with the team to honor our location preference - which they are great with and super accommodating for everyone.

So with that here's the overview on room types and locations 

**Sea Shell & Beachtree**:

* *Ground floor* = Partial Ocean View Room 
* *Upper floor* = Prime Ocean View Room

**King's Pond & Palm Grove**:

* *Ground floor* = Ocean View Room
* *Upper floor* = Prime Ocean View Room 

\*\*all ground for units have a massive outdoor rock shower in addition to the indoor shower and soaking tub. 

**Ocean Golf View Room**: they aren't in any crescent at all. And they honestly kind of stink. I would not book into one of these. You're far from everything and have no real views and really none of the vibe of the other rooms that are in the crescents. 

**Poolside Rooms**: These ones are less common room types and they are located on the corners of Sea Shell & Beachtree (ex bungalows 15 & 19 & part of 20)

**Partial Ocean View Room**: these will always put you in Sea Shell or Beach Tree. The Sea Shell Partial Ocean Views also have a great little lawn area in front that parents often love because you can hang on your patio and face the pool/ocean and the kids can run around in the grass a bit. Easy place to have your morning coffee. 

**Ocean View Room**: ground floor units these will always pretty much always put you in King's Pond or Palm Grove. There are a super small number that are in Sea Shell and Beacthree

**Prime Ocean View Room**: this is the second floor level of all of the 4 crescents. So if you book this one, make sure you make your preference on location known. 

**Oceanfront Rooms**: just like the Poolside Rooms, there aren't many of this category and they are found in Bungalow 1, 9, 17 & 24. They are really a charming room type and the one I stayed in when I was on property most recently. I was in Bungalow 1. You get incredible beach/ocean and sunset views in these ones.

I was working 2 jobs in Oregon. I needed both to pay my bills. My beertending job I was at for 1 year, working 10-15 hours a week. 10 towards the end. Then I had a coffee job which was at least 30 hours a week. Things got weird with the beer job, as I had heard from someone before me about how shady things were being run: ie things like the GM taking from the tip pool as well as working 10 hour shifts with no breaks. Anyways, I put my head down and worked for a year. Towards the end I got fired for no reason. Unless a reason is the GM did not like me and kept picking on me for the tiniest things, I also have a feeling he knew I was on to their shady practices. 

So, in short I end up losing that job and realizing I really cannot make it out there. I quit the coffee job and let them know I am leaving because I cannot afford to be in Oregon, and will be going to live with family in my home state. So, I filed unemployment and after 6 weeks now I am getting denied. The reasons are as follows ""The adjudicators statement is that you are not credible, that you moved because you could not afford Oregon because the previous job that you lost was a bartender job, which should have been easy to replace in the climates labor market of Portland"" and ""When you quit work because you could no longer afford to live in Oregon after losing your other job. This was not a reason of such gravity that you had no alternative but to leave work""

I am truly baffled. It seems the coffee shop tried telling them that I myself claimed the reason was to be with family, which is not true. I am filing an appeal but not sure if I should get my hopes up. I can prove to them how behind I was and am on bills. I can also express to them truly how I moved to Oregon to pursue a career, and coming back to my hometown was the last thing I wanted. Does anyone have any advice on how to prepare for my hearing?

We are looking at single dose grinders. Based in Ireland so the Lagom Casa and Niche Zero will work out as roughly the same price for us or the difference is not enough to warrant one over the other. 

We have the Bambino plus and no grinder at the moment.

I drink mostly americanos and my husband drinks cappuccinos. We will be using medium roast beans. Also will be using decaf beans for iced lattes but aside from that we won’t be looking to make filter/pour over. 

I am new to this so looking for something that is easy to dial in and for a noob. Also something that is easy to clean. And to be able to switch between the decaf and normal coffee beans. 

Any advice on which to go for between the two? Or if there is another around the same price point that would be a lot better? We would hope this would last us and that we wouldn’t have to upgrade in the future.

I stumbled upon this sub and just wanted to relieve my soul. I'm apologising in advance for this post being very long, I wanted to provide more context to the entire story.

I'm 26, female and I have few friends I consider close, plus few people I met by having the same hobby (I made art as hobby but it turned in a little side job that led me online communities and convet) which led to meetings and friendship despite some of them living in different countries, but I still considered people I've been friends since school days my closest friends. 

This part isn't about people I've met through hobby.

I'm the one who remembers, calls, listen, help keep a pet or move/clean apartmens, buy presents for them and their children/spouses, help with notes and studies. It was like that during our time in school, when I was busy with uni, than my career/job, nothing changed during nor after I got married to a man I've been with since we were in highschool, nor now when I'm completely free because I don't work due to spine injury (sick leave is 6 months, than board approves prolonged leave if they find you unable to work. It's possible only in cases of serious medical conditions), I always have time to answer the call or to send a message to check on them. But none of them would do the same for me.
(Sidenote, my husband isn't clingy, nor he puts himself in our hangouts unless he is invited to a party or we host a party. And most of the time he hang with husbands and boyfriends of my friends. Boys talks I guess) 


Excuse my friends started using frequently is that they don't want to bother me because I'm sick. 
By sick they mean that I have had spinal injury around a year ago, now awaiting surgery. I'm in and out of doctors office a lot, but I don't bother people with that problem. I stll can take medication, walking cane, and walk out to cafe or bar and sit there for hour or two with occasional standing up to move my legs a bit. My condition isn't contagious nor do I complain around about it, no one is obligated to bear with my health struggles. I talk about it only if someone explicitly asks what's wrong with my back/legs. But I feel like they just found perfect excuse now. I had hospital stay some time ago, not a single message from them to check if I was ok.

Few weeks ago I reached out to a friend I haven't seen in a long time because she didn't reach out to me in any other form except sending insta reels. Asked to meet at least for a coffee since she's busy per her words, she couldn't. Later that same day I saw her in a bar with other people. We also used to work in the same company as mechanical engineers, until I got sick leave approval, at work she had other group she spent breaks with. I don't mind since she is in quality control sector and I'm part if the powertrain engineering team. 


Back in February, I messaged to another friend (9 years long friendship) for her bday, gave her present a bit earlier since I wanted to surprise her as soon as the present arrived, she opened the message like month later than replayed to it mid April saying she's busy and doesn't feel like talking to anyone. Since than she's ignoring all my posts, stories etc on socials despite being active all day. Which shows me she deliberately doesn't want to talk to me specifically, not everyone as she claims.

Since things like this kept happening for a long time, I just decided to stop reacting out to all of them. Than yesterday I stumbled upon one of those friends in shopping centre, and I was scolded for 'not reaching out like I forgot he existed'. He was quite offended when I said it's because I'm busy.

Meanwhile, we all live in the same city, small city to add to that, less than 200k people, you can walk it over in like 2h, so we are not that far away. And not all of us are the part of the same friend group, so it's not like they are together in the ignoring me for longest time game. We all have other friends too if that makes sense. 

Back to people I met accidentally online/at cons 4-5 years ago. They are messaging frequently, some of them visited on a lot of occasions, staying at our home so they don't have to pay for hotel or food, still insisted to repay somehow. We visited them (many of them invited my husband as well), same story. We exchanged packages with souvenirs, snacks, presents through the years. They always remembered my husband as well in those packages. One friend even went out of his way to visit wanting us to show him the country but only by travelling the ways and places that can accommodate my condition. If impossible, he was willing to just chill at home with us for 10 days. We still went to 7 different cities and had great time. Those people live in countries like Luxembourg, Japan, India, BiH, UK, Malaysia, Korea, North Carolina (USA). Despite time difference, we do texting, video calls. They don't mind posting photos with me. Something people I've known almost since childhood never do. But people whose life is somewhere else, far away, still can make time and introduce me to other friends and family. 

Now I feel like a bad person for ignoring their existence, but I'm just sad and disappointed. I don't even feel like confronting them and asking am I that unlikeable that they are around only if they need something or if I pull they by the sleeve. 
Was all the time we hang out because they pitied me, or something changed in the meantime....did I do something, anything to be that unlikeable to them.

Thanks to everyone who reads to all if this. I wrote literal essay.

1mvimoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1mvimoz/so_what_now/,So… What now?,"Hi there! I’ve recently been struggling with some issues. I just get these feelings of emptiness out of nowhere. I can wake up early in the morning, get ready for the day, sit down for breakfast and coffee and then suddenly find it being 8 hours later. Nothing in between, no accomplishments, no tasks done that used to be simple, no joy, no thoughts, nothing.

To cope I’ve set up a “small victories” scheme where I count every little small thing I do as a victory. Not to then reward myself, but rather to get the feeling the day wasn’t completely wasted. To be able to see a list of things I have done. It’s hard for me to have to do this, as somewhere in my brain I’m kicking myself for no longer being as functional as I once was.

A while ago I made some steps I’m proud of. I opened up to a select few, some friends, a trusted colleague, my parents, and importantly mental healthcare professionals.

Here’s my issue… what now? I’m at a phase where I have tons of people around me trying to help, but the healthcare system in my country is such that you get to experience the joy of having to wait 9 weeks for actual help. Heck, waiting for the conversations to figure out a course of action took 5 weeks.

There’s no concrete steps for me to take. There’s a million “tips and tricks” that people have lovingly given me, and I appreciate those a lot, but they’re not the holy grails that fix my problems. Some help, others do nothing.

There’s no diagnosed label to hand out to for example work. Currently if I don’t feel up to working, while I don’t use excuses and just flat out say “mentally I am currently not capable of doing work”, I don’t really have the kind of doctor’s note you would get from an illness or the visible cast you would get from breaking a bone.

It’s hard not having anything to point to. It’s hard to not be able to say “I have X/Y”. I know I am my own person and I know myself best, but how do I say what I feel and what I just can’t do to people I don’t want to share my whole story with? How do I deal with work? What can I do in between the various mental healthcare appointments?

I am sorry for partially rambling and not being fully capable of writing out everything I feel in a coherent way. I am barely functioning at the moment, but I just would like some advice on what’s next.

Samsung SDI featured my home lab in a documentary on their official YouTube channel. It's a 3-minute piece that shows both my day job as an embedded engineer working on EV battery management systems and my after-hours tinkering at home.

https://preview.redd.it/l3t4v52x37kf1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c86466c3860b3acd4a4fb40fafbd6d4efe66c57

**The video:** [https://youtu.be/5PxKBkhkRJM?si=5prGaKsBvyf4vKVF](https://youtu.be/5PxKBkhkRJM?si=5prGaKsBvyf4vKVF)

**Day job**

I work in Samsung SDI's BMS Development Group, primarily on battery management systems for electric vehicles. My focus areas include...

* CDD implementation for wireless BMS (working with ADI and TI chipsets)
* Async UART and SPI driver development/integration
* Currently deep into a wireless BMS R&D project

**The home lab journey**

What started as curiosity-driven teardowns of random electronics has evolved into something more substantial. After plenty of failures (and I mean *plenty..!!*), I've built up a decent setup with oscilloscopes, optical microscopes, 3D printer, and various other tools that have turned my space into a mini lab.

These days I'm mostly into reverse engineering and modifying home appliances

* Air purifiers with custom displays
* Old coffee machines getting new firmware(adding esp32 wifi module)
* Writing custom code to make devices do things they were never meant to do

The failure rate is still high, but there's something deeply satisfying about breathing new life into old hardware or making a ""**dumb""** device smart.

**Why both worlds matter**

What's interesting is how working with software architecture at the office and getting hands-on with hardware at home complement each other. You start seeing theory play out in practice in unexpected ways. The constraints and challenges are different, but the problem-solving mindset carries over.

Would love to connect with others here who are into embedded systems, whether professionally or as hobbyists. What's your setup like? Anyone else find themselves unable to resist taking things apart ""just to see how it works""?",5,1755705097.0,embedded,0,1.0,False
1mvilz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colts/comments/1mvilz9/colts_conspiracy_theories/,Colts Conspiracy Theories,"I’ve noticed some weird occurrences observing the Colts the past few years. It’s fine to the point where I truly believe there are hired gremlins in the practice facility, and deeply imbedded in the organization.

A)Did anyone else notice all the slippage on home games last year on the field? Near the hash marks (e.g. the week 1 bomb throw) and near the sidelines (e.g. goofy unexplained trippings by receivers such as Adonai Mitchell). There were groundskeepers gremlins paid under the table to sabotage the season, in a subtle way.

B)Might be a stretch……but nah, they were putting meth in the training tables food supply, specifically the wide receiver group, and possibly the tight ends. Only this would explain the goofy activities and spazz like behavior of Michael Pittman Jr (after basically every catch he has he does something strange and chaotic), Josh Downs (unexplainably odd and crackhead like end zone dances and first down celebrations), Adonai Mitchell (perhaps recieved the highest doses, acted very weirdly), Alec Pierce frequently looked gaunt and with speedy dark circles in press conferences, with odd changes in his manner of speech, and the entire tight end group. I’m sure you noticed Ogletree’s activities, the unspeakable acts of Granson, as well as Jelani Woods, who had the misfortune of being a victim of both the gremlin groundskeepers, which caused his toe injury, and the meth. 

C)they snuck drugs, possibly meth, into Steichens coffee, I noticed his anxiety and frequent meltdowns in press conferences, a direct result of meth consumption. 

If we fully examine the weird occurrences of the past 2 years, I’m sure much more would be uncovered. Perhaps a team of filmmakers at a local university should do an intrepid investigation.

1mvil5s,https://v.redd.it/38udq95h47kf1,My neighbor who's 13 years older than me finally agreed to go on a real date with me after me pestering her and her telling me 'i'm way too young for her' befor,"I genuinely love her. We've known each other for 5 months (she moved in 2 floors down) She's super friendly, nurturing, and honestly amazing. I hate girls my age, they're immature, stupid unrealistic and I can't hold a conversation with them for longer than 5 mins. With her I could talk for HOURS if it were possible. We have similar interests (old Hollywood films, alt-rock music, Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hai.) Since we met, I've dropped hints I like her n few months ago I told her outright and asked her out. She politely declined & said it'd be bad if my parents found out and that I'm too young. I apologized next day on whatsapp but told her my feelings were real. We've mostly stopped talking since then but still text ""good morning"" every few days. Last week however i met her during our building complex' Janmashtami celebration and she was asking how i was doing. One thing led to another and after 20 mins of me getting carried away and being flirty AGAIN, i asked her if she wanted to get coffee some time, and she said how about we have dinner on Thursday night. I was about to do back flips from the happiness bruh but i kept my cool.

Tomorrow is the day.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? How do I approach this without screwing it up and show her I genuinely want something serious, and am not just some immature young f*ckboi? I can't mess this up",0,1755705037.0,TeenIndia,15,0.38,False

1mvijdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mvijdf/does_mind_reader_coffee_pod_drawer_enhance_your/,Does Mind Reader Coffee Pod Drawer Enhance Your Countertop Organization? Read This Review!,"The Mind Reader TRY30-BLK Single-Serve Coffee Pod Drawer quickly became a staple in my kitchen. If you’re always on the hunt for coffee pods and aren’t a fan of the countertop chaos, this sleek organizer might just be the real solution you didn't know you needed. Designed to hold up to 30 coffee pods in five neat rows, it’s made my mornings an entirely new kind of zen. At first, I doubted the plastic frame would hold up over weeks of repeated use, but after putting it through the paces, I was pleasantly surprised by its durability.

**Design and Space Efficiency**  
The sleek and compact design was one of the initial draws for me. It fits perfectly under my single-serve coffee machine, doubling as a stable brewer base. The flat design is a serious countertop-saver—it barely takes up any space. Measuring around 12.75 inches long by 10.5 inches wide, this thing practically disappears into the aesthetic of my kitchen. Plus, the black finish gives it a modern touch that blends in smoothly with most appliances.  

[Check Mind Reader TRY30-BLK price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00xblgres/)

**Ease of Use and Functionality**  
Arranging pods in this drawer feels oddly satisfying. The five neatly divided rows make it easy to store different flavors and quickly pick what I want—even under caffeine-deprived conditions at 6:30 a.m. Cleaning is ridiculously simple too. A quick wipe with a damp cloth and it stays pristine, even after a busy breakfast shift. The rubber grips on the base are practical, adding stability while pulling out pods or brewing coffee. It’s appreciated on those mornings when I’m rushing and might accidentally shove the whole thing during my quest for caffeine.  

**Positives**  
- Compact and space-saving design.  
- Stable base with rubber grips to protect against slipping.  
- Organized rows for effortless pod selection.  

**Build Quality and Durability**  
Honestly, I wasn’t entirely convinced when I learned this product is made of heavy-duty plastic, but its durability is a pleasant surprise. Despite daily use—including sliding it back and forth while accessing the back of my coffee machine—it’s held up remarkably well. I braced myself for creaking or bending, especially when loaded with pods, but it’s remained solid. Not to mention, at 2.25 pounds, it’s sturdy enough to feel well-crafted but light enough to move if necessary.  

**Downsides**  
- Limited capacity for larger households needing more than 30 pods accessible.  
- The plastic frame, while durable, may not appeal to everyone aesthetically.  

**Target Users and Gift Potential**  
This drawer caters perfectly to anyone who owns a single-serve coffee machine. I’ve even got a few coworkers eyeing it for their offices—a tidy stash of coffee at work could make Monday mornings slightly more bearable! It’s also lightweight and compact enough to travel with; I could imagine taking it along on trips for those “hotel coffee not cutting it” situations. And if you’ve got friends or family who adore their pod brewers but could use a bit more organization, it’s an excellent gift.

**Product Comparisons**  
Compared to other organizers I’ve looked at, many alternative options are either bulkier or lack the streamlined design I’ve come to love about this one. Some alternatives in the market add tiers or stackable components, which can hold more pods but eat up way more space. This product strikes a neat balance between practicality and space-saving, especially given that it serves as a machine base as well. However, premium metal options from competitors may offer a higher-end aesthetic, which might suit fancier kitchen setups better, but they often come at a heftier price.  

**Value for Money**  
For the price, the Mind Reader TRY30-BLK delivers excellent functionality and makes daily coffee routines so much easier. I’ve not felt the need to splurge on additional organizers or accessories since purchasing this. Given its practical features and stable build quality, it earns its place in the “bang for the buck” category.

I have a eureka silenzio and don’t want to do anymore maintenance than regular by using these beans if they will cause issues. Can anyone shed some light on this topic before I just use the beans in pour over with a different grinder?

1mvigzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mvigzm/the_brutal_truth_about_dating_in_london_as_a/,The brutal truth about dating in London as a mid-20s guy,"This isn’t really a question,  just me venting. Curious if anyone else feels the same, and what you actually *do* about it.

I’m 28, from Greater London. Middle-class area, massively overpriced. Rent or mortgages are basically impossible for anyone in their 20s on a normal salary. Add bills, living costs, and forget it.

So most people my age (25–30) still live at home. I’d say 65–70%. These aren’t lazy kids — they’re professionals with “good” jobs, uni grads, the whole thing. Moving out just isn’t realistic.

Getting into central London takes about an hour. Dating across the city? Pretty much impossible.

I spent time living in Southeast Asia and dating there was *night and day*. Meeting people was effortless. Unlimited affordable, romantic date options. Even when you’re expected to pay as a guy, it doesn’t wreck your bank account.

Back here? Dating feels near impossible.

You can’t really “meet people naturally” unless you’re a pub regular (expensive + not that fulfilling). So it’s basically just dating apps.

And dates in London are brutal on the wallet. A boring low-effort one? £20. Try to make it interesting? £80–£100, gone. Even a “cheap” coffee date is £10+, and let’s be real — coffee dates (or equivalent) usually have zero spark. If you’re already starting from an app (less magic to begin with), you *have* to put in extra effort or it goes nowhere.

Do the maths: if a decent date costs ~£100, and it takes 5–10 first dates before you find someone you actually click with, that’s £500–£1,000 just to *start* dating properly. Insane.

And yeah, I’ll admit it… as a guy trying to save to move out and buy a car that doesn’t embarrass me, it’s frustrating. Especially when the woman I’m with might even earn more than me, but still expects me to cover everything.

The tradition of men paying came from a time when women didn’t work. That’s not reality anymore. In the UK, women in their 20s now earn more on average than men. Yet men are still expected to pay, be financially stable, have the nice car. In today’s economy? Almost no one can hit that standard. And it’s only getting worse.

To be fair, I do get why women like it when men pay — it makes them feel cared for, taken seriously. This isn’t a dig at women.

What gets me is how London (and honestly the UK in general) has almost no natural ways to meet people (except for pubs, and FYI you can forget about going to clubs in this country!). Combine that with how unaffordable *everything* is (housing, food, going out, activities) and you end up with a lonely culture where dating feels like an expensive uphill battle.

In SEA, I saw poverty, but the culture/infrastructure meant money didn’t equal loneliness. Here, no disposable income basically = no social life.

So yeah. Anyone else feel this? What do you do about it?

For me, the loneliness of being mid-20s in Greater London has hit hard since coming back. Honestly makes me sad. My plan? Leave the UK again soon.

1mvi9vz,https://i.redd.it/6jbixxuc27kf1.jpeg,How to Quit Smoking for Good?,"“How I finally quit smoking after 30+ years with a method hardly anyone talks about” (a true story)

I’ve always been annoyed by the title of Allen Carr’s book *“The Easy Way to Stop Smoking.”* For those who’ve lived with this habit for decades, “easy” sounds like a cruel joke. I’m convinced there’s nothing “easy” about addiction. That’s why in this article, I want to talk not about an easy way, but about a *deep* psychological way.

This method helped my mom, who smoked for more than 30 years, tried to quit dozens of times, and failed every single time — until she finally took this new path.

I’ve never smoked myself. I can’t stand the smell of that acrid smoke — and let’s not even start on the health risks. But I’ve always been fascinated by this question: A person stands with a cigarette in their hand. They know perfectly well it’s harmful. They’ve seen the gruesome pictures on cigarette packs, read countless medical warnings. And still, they light up. *Why?*

Whenever I asked smokers “why,” all I got back was an irritated: *“Leave me alone, I smoke because I want to.”*

I never got a real, reasoned answer. But my curiosity didn’t fade. Since I’m a huge fan of Jungian psychology, I decided to look at the question through that lens.

What if smoking isn’t just about nicotine, but something much deeper? What if smoking is actually a symbolic dialogue with the Shadow — the part of ourselves we repress, deny, or try not to acknowledge?

For many, smoking isn’t just a bad habit. It’s a ritual, a meeting with repressed energy. And that’s why it’s so hard to let go.

# The first cigarette is almost always about the shadow

It’s about:

* The desire to look grown-up, strong, independent.
* A rebellion against rules and control.
* Curiosity about the forbidden.

At that stage, a cigarette is like a key to a secret door — a door to a world where you can be different: bold, disobedient, “wrong.”

Add chemistry to the symbolism, and the ritual gets stronger. Smoke rises upward, unconsciously resembling a connection with something higher, transcendent.

# Why it’s so hard to quit

If it were just about nicotine, quitting would be easy. But often it’s about something else:

* A small act of rebellion: *“Yes, I know it’s harmful. I’ll do it anyway.”*
* A hidden way to release aggression: fire and smoke symbolizing suppressed energy.
* A personal ritual of freedom: *“This cigarette is my territory, my pause. No one has power over me here.”*

That’s why people cling to cigarettes. They’re not just inhaling smoke — they’re symbolically replacing unmet needs.

Every smoker is smoking their own Shadow.

* For some, it’s the Rebel — feeling free through the cigarette.
* For others, it’s the Self-Punisher — smoking as hidden aggression turned inward.
* For some, it’s the Seeker of Power — *“I play with death, I control it.”*
* And for others, it’s the Escapist — the cigarette offers a pause, an escape from feelings.

Once you understand *which* part of your Shadow is smoking, it becomes easier to choose another way.

# A small practice

Next time you reach for a cigarette, pause for 10 seconds and ask yourself: “Who wants to smoke right now?” Write it down in your journal. After a week, you’ll see which Shadow speaks the loudest.

# Quitting Smoking with Shadow Work

Instead of battling with “willpower,” try a different path: integration.

1. Identify the Shadow image behind your cigarette. Ask yourself: *“Who is speaking in me when I want to smoke? The Rebel? The Aggressor? The Scared Child?”*
2. Acknowledge the repressed energy. Instead of: *“I must quit,”* say: *“I see that a part of me seeks freedom/aggression/comfort through smoking. I accept that part.”*
3. Give that energy another channel.

* Aggression → sports, honest conversations, cathartic practices.
* Rebellion → creativity, travel, healthy risks.
* Need for ritual → breathwork, tea ceremony, journaling.
* Self-punishment → working with guilt, self-compassion practices.
* Seeking pleasure → non-destructive joys: sensory pleasures (good coffee, a piece of chocolate, fragrances, candles), body practices (massage, stretching, yoga nidra, warm shower with oils), pleasure-based creativity (music, painting, dance).

No, I’m not promising this method is “easy” or that it will work 100% for everyone. But it *did* help my mom. Only when she uncovered the hidden psychological roots of her craving (and there were many!) could she approach quitting more consciously.

Instead of breaking herself and suffering, she began untangling — step by step — what really drove her to smoke.

The key is this: find the true reason. Once you find it, you can choose a new, healthier way to meet that need.

[Shadow Work](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFHCRGWF) raises self-awareness. And the more awareness we bring to our actions, the easier it becomes to understand:

* *Why we do what we do (even if it’s destructive).*
* *Why it feels beneficial to keep doing it (even if it hurts us or others).*
* *What need lies behind the action.*
* *How to meet that need differently.*

None of this sounds fun. Asking yourself hard, uncomfortable questions is painful. But Shadow questions lead us to radical honesty with ourselves — and that honesty gives us real freedom.

If you smoke, don’t try to break yourself with sheer willpower. Instead, meet your Shadow. Where there’s smoke, there’s always a hidden voice. Hear it — and you may finally be able to let go of the cigarette forever.",1,1755704363.0,spicy_topics,0,1.0,False

We live in the city and use a commercial composting service that drops off and picks up a 5-gallon-bucket once a week. They accept all food products (yes, meat, bones, grease), paper products, commercially compostable cups or tableware, etc. We usually keep the bucket outside. We have a small “compost caddy,” in the fridge, which we use day-to-day to avoid smell/ avoid walking outside just to dump some coffee grounds or non-eaten toddler meals. For napkins and kitchen clean-up right now, we’re just using paper towels and then putting them in the compost. We also have a regular trash can and a recycle bin. 


My daughter has learned to use paper towels to wipe her hands and face and she also also wipes the counter or table (and sometimes floors, and toys, and a scar on Mama’s knee, and the cat). She then puts the paper towels in the trash can. She also finds any trash or food wrappers on the floor and happily takes them over to the trash can, which she can open. She can’t open the fridge doors by herself and she can’t reach the in-fridge compost bin even if she got the fridge open. 


For things like paper towels and food scraps, I’d like to compost them. Sometimes she’ll walk something over to the fridge and hit it, aka asking me to open it. I’d like a better system, but also, it’s summer and we get fruit flies, and idk how I feel about letting “her,” compost sit out all day. I guess I’d like something she can access herself, but also I don’t want her being able to dig around in trash/ compost (she’s gone back for “toys” that we’ve thrown away).

I’m struggling with almost every aspect of daily task required to maintain health and hygiene. I can’t balance on one leg and the crutches hurt the cuts on my palms. That means I can’t access appliances, the fridge, pantry, stove, pick up things I dropped, etc. 

I have a lot of success doing things on the carpet, but getting up and down is hard on my good leg. Showering is okay too. 

But the Doctor said I was dehydrated yesterday, which is because it’s burdensome for me to get a glass of water. Tried to make coffee today, but I dropped grounds on the floor, spilled boiling water on myself and fell. Normally I’d clean up the mess right away, but how could I get the towels off the floor after?

I think part of the answer is to have someone come over and meal prep for me the whole day, but I’m not sure who that person is? I think I need a cleaner to come too, but how do I find someone who also does laundry and misc stuff around the house (water plants tidy stuff). 

Also, if there’s a resource like a video or something I can show my boyfriend and relatives how difficult it is to do stuff with a non weight bearing leg and/or bad balance. I would really appreciate it. I don’t think they understand as they aren’t being very helpful. 

My boyfriend at first said he would help out, but then he gets surly about it. He makes me dictate every little part of a task like he doesn’t know how to do it on his own (putting water in the filter, making a sandwich, starting the dryer on low. ) it’s exhausting and it makes me feel like I’m begging.

1mvhti1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechInUse/comments/1mvhti1/should_you_try_best_wireless_headphones/,Should You Try Best Wireless Headphones PowerLocus P2 Today,"Testing out the PowerLocus P2 Bluetooth headphones has been quite the experience. I’ve used numerous audio devices in the past, and while some impressed me, others fell flat. The P2 offers some unique features that make it stand out, but there are a few shortcomings I feel are worth mentioning. These headphones cater to a broad audience—kids, teens, and adults alike—and come with features that suit various lifestyles, whether you're into gaming, fitness, or just relaxing with music. Here's how they fared in my day-to-day use.  

**Design and Comfort**  
The build quality of these headphones genuinely caught me off guard. The materials used felt premium to the touch, with the leather and memory foam combination on the earcups and headband providing top-notch comfort. Even after wearing them for a couple of hours, my ears felt fine, with no awkward pressure points, making them ideal for long work calls or extended Netflix binges. Plus, they’re foldable, which made them extremely practical for tossing into the included protective case whenever I hit the road. While they feel lightweight at only 6.2 ounces, they still give off a sturdy vibe, which is far better than some plastic-heavy models I’ve owned.  

**Connectivity and Pairing**  
Bluetooth 5.3 makes a significant difference. Setting up the connection was refreshingly easy—slide the power button, and the headphones are immediately discoverable on your device. I tested them on various gadgets, including my Android phone, laptop, and even a Fire TV, and the connection was consistently stable within its advertised 36-foot range. The multipoint pairing feature works surprisingly well, allowing me to switch between my phone and laptop seamlessly during work hours. A slight hiccup occurred when the Bluetooth signal weakened if I moved into a different room, which is something to keep in mind if you frequently wander around while listening.  

See [PowerLocus P2 price on Amazon](https://audio-play.com/p/b07c66sfjb/).  

**Audio Performance**  
I can’t deny it—the sound quality is fantastic for headphones in this range. High-definition stereo with deep bass provided the punch needed for bass-heavy tracks, while the mids and highs remained crisp and clear even as the volume hit higher levels. I appreciated the dynamic power sound for podcasts and audiobooks, too. However, although there’s some noise isolation, don’t expect complete noise cancellation in louder environments. Think of these as great headphones for regular settings but not necessarily for airy coffee shops or noisy subway rides.  

**Battery Life and Charging**  
The PowerLocus P2 headphones promise 15 hours of playtime, which turned out to be accurate during my testing. A full recharge only took about 2.5 hours, and it was nice to know I could plug in the 3.5mm audio cable for uninterrupted music once the battery drained. While this flexibility is a definite plus, I did feel a touch disappointed with the 15-hour battery life—a tad below the trend, especially with some competing brands pushing 20-30 hours. That said, for everyday use, the balance between wireless and wired modes makes this issue less of a deal-breaker.  

**Usage Versatility**  
Here’s where these headphones truly shine. They cater to almost any scenario—travel, gaming, home entertainment, and even casual fitness sessions. The built-in microphone performed well during online meetings, thanks to its noise reduction technology, which ensured clear communication. Switching between Bluetooth and the wired mode happened effortlessly, which added versatility to my activities. Their compatibility with practically any device sealed the deal. My nephew even borrowed them for a quick gaming session on a PS4, and he was impressed by how immersive the sound was.  

**Highlights**  
- Premium materials enhance comfort and durability.  
- Bluetooth 5.3 allows easy, stable connectivity with a decent range.  
- Punchy audio quality with satisfying bass and solid mids.  
- Compact, foldable, and comes with a protective case for portability.  

**Caveats**  
- Noise isolation is decent but may not suffice in loud environments.  
- Battery life could have been longer for modern standards.  
- Bluetooth struggles slightly with multi-room usage.  

**Competing Products**  
I couldn't help but compare the PowerLocus P2 headphones to similar models, such as the Anker Soundcore series or JBL Tune 750BTNC. While the JBL headphones offer more advanced active noise cancellation, they feel heavier on the ears long-term. The Anker Soundcore series provides slightly extended battery life, but they often lack the foldable, comfort-oriented design the P2 delivers. What sets the P2 apart is its multipoint pairing and its seamless switch between wireless and wired modes, which I didn’t find as intuitive in its competitors. While other brands might excel in specific areas, the P2 gives you a well-rounded experience, especially at its competitive price range.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Anyone considering a pair of headphones likely prioritizes cost alongside features, and the PowerLocus P2 holds its ground here. While it won't empty your wallet, you get a good balance of style, functionality, and sound performance. Compared to big players in the market, the P2 might lack some high-end features, but it compensates with long-lasting comfort, versatile use, and accessories like the protective case that extend its longevity.

I’ve recently had to change to a pretty low sugar diet (I can have sugar but need to limit it ). And I’m also on a calorie deficit diet for another reason so 600 calories frappes are no goes. 

I don’t go out to get coffee, treats and all that like I use too. But once a week, I like to treat myself to a coffee out. Right now the only place I’ve been able to go is Starbucks, because they have so many options for customization and the ability to remove the simple syrup, topping, whipped cream, and use SF syrup.

I was wondering if there were any local coffee shops that people knew that had sugar free and lower calories options like, SF syrups.

Please, please answer or at the very least maybe someone can direct me to the right place to ask.

My Father is the one with RA. We have 2 cats, we've had them for years before he agreed to live with us, they are not new.

Obviously we have a litter box, and a trash bin to throw away their waste, which I empty every 2 days. 

He doesn't need to interact with this waste what so ever, however it is in the basement laundry room. I have no other space to put their litter boxes.

How likely is it to make him sick?? The laundry room is of course separate from his own room and away from him. 

He does throw his dryer lint away in the same waste bin BUT he could also carry the lint into his bathroom trash can, so there's no need for him to be near it. 

He woke up and complained about it sitting there (beside the litter boxes) 

But he also goes out to fast food places to get a coffee every morning?? Which means a stranger, or a few strangers, are handling his coffees before he drinks them. 

I WILL be getting a new type of trash bin that seals, but how likely is it that he'll get sick from cat waste sitting in a bin, undisturbed? ",1,1755703165.0,rhumatoidarthritis,0,1.0,False

1mvhm75,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1mvhm75/should_you_try_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Should You Try the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker BELLA Today,"The Bella Single Serve Coffee Maker quickly became a part of my hectic morning routine. It’s a compact and efficient coffee machine that promises to brew fresh coffee from 6oz to 14oz, catering to individual preferences. The fact that it supports both coffee pods and ground coffee is a huge plus for any coffee lover. I tested it with my go-to brand of coffee grounds and several K-cup pods to see how versatile it really is. The results were consistent—a smooth, flavorful cup, whether I needed a quick boost or a larger portion for my travel mug.

**Design and Build Quality**  
If you’re like me and counter space is a precious commodity, this coffee maker will be your new best friend. Its slim and space-saving design fits neatly on any countertop, even in my cramped kitchen. The oatmilk-colored finish adds an aesthetic touch, blending beautifully with modern decor. The adjustable drip tray was a thoughtful addition, especially when I tried brewing directly into a 7-inch tall travel mug. It accommodates different cup sizes seamlessly without compromising on convenience.

[Check Bella Single Serve Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b0cyj6xt9s/)  

**Features and Versatility**  
I love a gadget that adapts to personal preferences, and this coffee machine does exactly that. The option to switch between coffee pods and ground coffee is fantastic for households with varied coffee habits. On weekdays, I found myself brewing quick pod-based coffee, while lazy weekends allowed me to indulge in freshly ground beans. The single-touch brewing mechanism made the process quick and efficient, saving precious morning minutes. Plus, with a 14oz water reservoir, it’s perfect for multiple small brews without constant refilling.  

**Pros**  
- Accommodates both coffee pods and ground coffee.  
- Slim and modern design ideal for smaller spaces.  
- Adjustable drip tray, compatible with taller mugs.  

**Cons**  
- Limited brewing capacity; not ideal for multiple large servings.  
- The oatmilk color might not appeal to everyone.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
One standout feature is the effortless cleanup process. With dishwasher-safe components such as the reusable filter, coffee pod adapter, and drip tray, it took less than a minute to clean up after brewing. I appreciated how the removable parts simplify maintenance; there’s nothing worse than struggling to scrub out coffee residue. The auto-shutoff feature was just icing on the cake, giving me peace of mind on mornings when I was rushing out the door.  

**Performance**  
The 1000-watt motor ensures a quick and consistent brew every time. Even with multiple back-to-back tests, there was no noticeable drop in performance or temperature, which speaks volumes about the heating system. I also liked how the machine didn’t retain any flavor residue when switching between coffee types. The aroma, texture, and freshness were consistent, no matter what I brewed.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Small water tank might not suit heavy coffee drinkers.  
- Slight dripping after brewing ends, though it’s manageable with the drip tray.

**Competing Products**  
In a market flooded with single-serve coffee makers, the Bella model holds its ground remarkably well. Against a similar product like Keurig K-Mini, Bella’s adjustable drip tray offers added versatility, although the Keurig edges out with a slightly larger water tank. If you’re dealing with limited space and need a no-fuss coffee maker, Bella beats bulkier rivals like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which requires more countertop real estate. Each option has its merits, but Bella’s dishwasher-safe parts and aesthetic design make it a standout choice for those prioritizing ease of use and style.

**Value for Money**  
Compared to rivals in its category, Bella offers excellent cost efficiency. It provides features typically found in higher-priced models while delivering the simplicity and compactness that busy individuals need. For me, it checked critical boxes: versatility, ease of operation, and consistent performance. Admittedly, if you’re making cups for a household of four every morning, you might want something with a larger capacity. But for single-serve simplicity without breaking the bank, this coffee maker is hard to beat.

Laundry day at my house has always felt like a delicate balancing act. Between kids with sensitive skin, my endless gym clothes, and a preference for quick-and-easy solutions, finding the right detergent has been more challenging than I care to admit. Testing out the Tide PODS Free & Gentle Laundry Detergent Soap Pacs, 112 Count, has been an unexpectedly refreshing experience. Not only does the product deliver exceptional cleaning, but it has also managed to sidestep some of the common issues I've encountered with other detergents. There's a lot to unpack here, so let’s break it down.

**Packaging and Ease of Use**  

What initially caught my eye was how portable and neat these detergent pods are. Forget about measuring liquid or powder; each pre-measured pac feels like the snap-and-go of laundry solutions. The plastic container it comes in is sturdy and compact enough not to hog my laundry shelf, while the lid locks firmly to keep the pod munchkins (read: kids) in my house safe. These pods are easy to toss directly into the drum, making laundry loads smoother and less chore-like.  

[Check Tide 3229 price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0btkkjlls/)  

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  

When it comes to getting stains out, I can confirm that these pods hold their own against the muddy soccer uniforms, coffee-stained shirts, and tomato-sauce mishaps that frequent my laundry. They’re touted as handling 100% of common stains, and I can vouch for that claim. Even my husband, whose work clothes seem immune to cleaning, noticed how fresh and stain-free everything felt. What’s fascinating is how well they work in cold water. I let my daughter experiment with her hand-wash setting, and the pods still delivered their potent cleaning performance. This versatility freed me from worrying about laundry-specific water conditions.  

**Hypoallergenic for Sensitive Skin**  

This was the real test for my family, as we’re no strangers to rashes or irritated skin when we use the wrong detergent. These pods are dye-free, perfume-free, and have been certified by the National Eczema Association (NEA) and the National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF). My youngest son has incredibly sensitive skin, and I was relieved to see that not only were his clothes fresh and soft after washing, but he didn’t have a smidgen of irritation, even after sweaty sports practices.  

**Positives**  
- Pre-measured pods remove the need for fiddly measuring or spills.  
- Hypoallergenic and NEA/NPF certified, making it an excellent choice for those with sensitive skin.  
- Exceptional stain-removal power, even on tough food and mud stains.  
- Adaptable to any washing machine and works wonderfully in cold water.  

**Packaging and Unit Count**  

I also appreciated that the pack includes a generous 112-count of pods. That's more than enough to tackle weeks of laundry without frequent reorders or shopping trips. The packaging feels both practical and environmentally considerate (although, let’s face it, pods like this come with their own concerns in terms of plastic wrapper wastage).

**Negatives**  
- Like most pod detergents, they’re more expensive per wash than traditional powders or liquids.  
- Some users might find that pods occasionally stick together in humid climates, requiring a gentle nudge to separate.  
- While the child-lock container is secure, overly curious kids might still become too interested in its bright, candy-like appearance without proper supervision.  

**Product Contenders**  

If you're exploring alternatives, comparable pod-style detergents are available. The Arm & Hammer Power Paks are a worthy mention, as they also cater to sensitive skin at a slightly lower price point. However, their stain-busting prowess is a notch below Tide—and you’ll likely find they struggle with cold water performance. Seventh Generation Free & Clear Pods are another option for eco-conscious individuals, offering plant-based cleaning ingredients, albeit less consistency on tougher stains. Tide Free & Gentle PODS outperform both in terms of cleaning balance, skin-friendliness, and their ability to tackle a variety of little disasters around the home.  

**Smart Spending**  

For the features offered—certifications for sensitive skin, deep-cleaning performance, and compatibility with various water temperatures—Tide PODS Free & Gentle deliver exceptional value. While they’re priced slightly higher than some options, the pros outweigh the added cost if you’re seeking quality and convenience for a family with diverse laundry needs. There’s undeniable appeal in being able to rely on a product that works across multiple settings while maintaining hypoallergenic properties.

I know it's tempting to drink coffee/caffeine beverages because of Nardils day time tiredness/fatigue/sleepiness (I know every individual reacts different) but in my experience the Anxiolytic benefits/effects of Nardil are majorly reduced if you keep on drinking caffeine.. Sometimes i woke up and didn't have my usual cup of coffee to start the day or any coffee for that matter during day and WOW I really felt the difference, i felt at peace and just a calmness in every situation, but if I drink coffee even if it's just one or worse 3 or 4 cups, Nardils anxiolytic effects were still kinda there but just not as potent.. So I have made the decision and decided to take this huge step and quit coffee/caffeine for good...

The fun thing is that some days ago I completed this part with the same character and everything went smoothly, but I ended up losing that save for an unrelated reason and I had to replay it again. This time, even if I do everything in the same way step by step the saving system goes haywire after exiting the van. 

I have been trying to get past this bug for a couple of days now, and I have been forced to go trough the goddamn forsaken braindance a minimum of 20 times at this point. The bug seems to be caused by either the brain-dance logic not being removed after the session or the van hay wiring things.

* Rewinding and pausing the braindance just before existing doesn't work.
* Scaning only the bare minimum elements off the braindance doesn't work.
* Scaning all the possible elements off the braindance doesn't work.
* Scaning all the important elements of the braindance  in order (pizza>suit>coffee) doesn't work.
* Fast traveling away after exiting the van allows me to save, but if I go to the mission area the bug triggers again.
* If I exit the Van just after finishing the braindance I can save, but if I go to the mission area the bug triggers.

If anyone has any input in this regard I would really appreciate it.

For reference, this is a pre 2.0 save that I updated to 2.0 and beyond.

Thanks a lot for your time.

It's an improved version of what was previously known as Based Cut and Streamlined Cut, but it was updated with a few restored scenes and even better transitioning here and there. Russian subtitles have also been added.

The core idea behind this edit (and the old ones) is to cut the fat from the show and leave only the good stuff like in your classical Marvel feature films. When I say fat - I mean the unnecessary side characters' subplots like Falon's family boat\\money problems, John Walker's depression or Bucky's remorse about killing the asian guy. A lot of Flagsmashers scenes have been cut when they were not advancing the plot. Same goes with the scenes which were explaining the stuff we have already seen and know as viewers. Also a lot of WALKING scenes have been trimmed for there are too many of them and they are too long. Majority of the cringy dialogue jokes have been cut as well as the IRL social commentaries about racism and politics. The Falcon's sympathy towards the Flagsmashers have been reduced, he no longer tells others to show respect to the ""not terrorists"", he just tries to avoid killing them and tries to talk Karlie down to avoid more bloodshed.

And now more specific on what have been changed from each episode:

**Episode 1**

\- Cut the scene between Sam and Torres at the cafe after the intro action scene.

\- Cut all the scenes with Bucky going out with his friends and going on a date.

\- Trimmed the Sam going back to his family scene also cut all his other family scenes except theTV one.

**Episode 2**

\- Trimmed the Jonh Walker and Lamar intro scene.

\- Trimmed the infiltration to the warehouse scene.

\- Cut the Flagsmashers ""people lobe you"" talk scene.

\- Trimmed the Isaiah Bradley visit scene.

\- Cut the arrest and police station scene.

\- Cut the Flagsmasher's ""suicide"" scene.

**Episode 3**

\- Cut the Jonh Walker's raiding scene.

\- Cut the chatting on the plane scene.

\- Trimmed the arrival to Madripur scene.

\- Cut the bar drink and fistfight scene.

\- Trimmed the Sharon's taking boys home scene.

\- Trimmed the ""at the docks"" scene to make it more fast-paced.

\- Cut the Flagshmashers plan talk scene.

\- Cut the John Walker and Lamar visiting prison scene.

**Episode 4**

\- Cut the Bucky in Wakanda scene.

\- Cut the boys in the flat talk scene.

\- Cut the boys visiting refugees centre scene.

\- Cut the Karli retrieves the serum from the sematary scene.

\- Trimmed the John and Lamar drinking coffee scene.

**Episode 5**

\- Trimmed the John Walker's being devastated scene.

\- Trimmed the John on trial scene.

\- Cut the aftercourt talk scene with Valentina.

\- Cut the Flagsmashers talk scene.

\- Trimmed the Bucky vs Zemo scene.

\- Trimmed the Isaiah Bradley visit scene.

\- Cut the Sam's family and boat scene. 

\- Cut the Bucky helps Sam with the boat scene (He just gives him the suitcase from Wakanda).

\- Trimmed the Bucky and Sam throw the shield and talk scene.

\- Cut the John Walker visiting Lamar's family scene.

**Episode 6**

\- Small cuts and trims here and there for a better pacing all along the episode.

\- Cut the Sam's final speech with the press and senators. (he goes past them straight to Bucky). The movie ends after a police officer tells Sam that there is another Flagsmasher has been spotted and Sam's flying leads to end credits.

\- Cut the Zemo blowing up the trucks from prison scene.

\- All the following scenes with Sam and Bucky have been cut.

\- US Agent scene moved to be the second ""after credit"" scene.

\- Marvel logo added after the credits like in all the movies.

My sister (27F) was just a baby at the time, so she doesn't remember him at all. We never had any contact with him after that. My mom never really talked about it with us. As I got older, I asked her more about what happened, and she told me their marriage was unhappy. She never loved him, and they only got married because she was pregnant with me. She also hinted that she may not have been completely faithful to him, but I stopped pressing her on that because I didn't want to embarrass her.

At some point, my sister looked him up online and found out that he remarried and had another daughter. She wrote him a letter, but he never responded. I told her to just let it go.

Last week, I got the news that he had died. His wife, Tara, contacted me and we met for coffee to talk. I was a bit confused that she called me and not my sister, but I didn't think much of it. When we met, she was nicer than I expected. She told me that my dad felt regret about never reconnecting with me while he was alive.

She said the funeral was in two weeks and that I should be there, especially since I was mentioned in his will. Apparently, he left me a substantial portion of his assets. My dad wasn't super wealthy, but he worked in finance and had more money than I expected.

At that point, I asked about my sister, and Tara got uncomfortable. She suggested I speak to my mom first and then get back to her. After a long conversation with my mom, she finally admitted that my sister was ""probably"" not my dad's biological daughter.

I wasn't expecting that. I spoke to Tara again, and she said she didn't hold any ill will towards my sister, but my dad didn’t want anything to do with her. Tara also claimed that my dad tried to reconnect with me (but not my sister) a few years after he left, but my mom prevented it. I’m not sure if that’s true, as my mom denies it.

My sister is in denial about all of this. She still considers him her father and wants to go to the funeral. She says she doesn’t care about the money, but I still plan to share whatever I receive with her. I spoke to Tara again, and she insisted that my sister cannot come to the funeral. I told her I wouldn’t go either, then. Tara asked me to reconsider. I’m really torn about what to do.",4,1755701987.0,AITAH,15,0.75,False

I’m exploring an idea for a new service in Dublin city centre: a **secure indoor hub for e-bikes and e-scooters**. The idea is that you could pay by the hour to park your bike/scooter safely inside, with charging points available and maybe even a small coffee dock.

I’ve put together a quick survey (10 questions, takes 2 mins) to see if people would actually use something like this: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduLrGmD9Jvmsiz4zfF4dHh7ekUC\_KCXQyGhFZk11q78YSxaA/viewform?usp=dialog](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduLrGmD9Jvmsiz4zfF4dHh7ekUC_KCXQyGhFZk11q78YSxaA/viewform?usp=dialog)

I’d love to hear your thoughts — especially on:

* Would you pay for safe indoor parking?
* What feels like a fair price?
* Would charging and a coffee spot make it more attractive?

1mvh0fh,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1mvh0fh/should_you_buy_the_best_air_fryer_toaster_oven/,Should You Buy the Best Air Fryer Toaster Oven Instant Pot Vortex,"Sampling dinner remnants and baking cookies has never been the same since I got to test the Instant Pot 140-4002-01. It’s not every day that a kitchen gadget offers 10 different cooking functions all in one compact unit. Air frying as I stream my favorite shows? Yes, please. Roasting a whole chicken on its rotisserie spit? Consider me chef-level. This device genuinely feels like having a miniature Michelin chef right on my counter. That said, while I’m thoroughly impressed with its versatility and aesthetics, there are some nuances worth discussing.

**Sleek Yet Functional Design**  
The black stainless steel finish is surprisingly elegant, and it elevates any countertop into looking a little more “put together.” Its dimensions—12 inches deep, 12 wide, and just under 14 tall—mean it doesn’t monopolize valuable kitchen real estate. Yet, it’s spacious enough to bake a 12-inch pizza or toast six slices of bread. It comfortably nested next to my coffee machine, balancing utility and aesthetics. One minor observation: at 29.3 pounds, it’s hefty, so I wouldn’t recommend moving it around frequently.

**Advantages**  
- Hosts 10 cooking functions including air frying, broiling, toasting, and more.  
- Features EvenCrisp Technology, ensuring crispy results with 95% less oil—my fries never looked or tasted healthier.  
- Double-layer glass door seals in the heat perfectly without warming up my entire kitchen.  
- Accessories like the air frying basket, baking tray, and rotisserie spit are as handy as they sound.  

[Check Instant Pot 140-4002-01 price on Amazon.](https://coolpromoproducts.com/p/b08pl327w4/)

**Performance That Delivers**  
With 1800 watts powering it, the cooking power of this product shouldn’t go unnoticed. Chicken breasts came out remarkably juicy during my first test with the convection function. On a particularly experimental Thursday, I dehydrate some apple slices with their built-in feature, and the results rivaled the store-bought packs I’m usually addicted to. Even with my limited culinary skills, it felt like this gadget was helping me fake being a top-notch cook. Although the learning curve is relatively gentle, cycling through its multiple functions with an easy-to-use dial takes a bit of getting used to.

**Disadvantages**  
- The instruction manual isn’t quite comprehensive, meaning trial and error becomes your best friend.  
- While the 36-inch cable length is decent, tighter kitchens with limited outlets might find it just a tad inconvenient.  
- Its plastic body is less durable compared to metal-bodied competitors.  

**Family Size Convenience**  
Its 18L capacity is what makes it such a strong contender among multi-use ovens. My niece’s birthday cake experiment and my cousin's attempt at homemade pizza proved that this oven genuinely has your family events covered. Feeding larger groups is seamless, and whether you're crisping up potato wedges or roasting a rotisserie chicken, the space inside adjusts effortlessly.

**Strengths**  
- Large capacity fantastic for families or frequent hosts.  
- Compact design that utilizes its internal space effectively.  
- Dishwasher-safe enamel tray and frying basket reduce cleanup time.  

**Competing Products**  
Against similar countertop ovens like the Breville Smart Oven Air and Ninja Foodi, this product holds its own with standout positives like the EvenCrisp technology and family-sized capacity. The Breville leans more premium with its aesthetics but also marks a steeper price tag, while the Ninja Foodi excels in pressure cooking rather than pure air frying/crisping. The Instant Pot model hits the practical sweet spot for balancing functionality and affordability, particularly with its user-friendly controls and useful accessories.

**Value for Money**  
Given its versatility, any investment in this appliance feels well-justified for households that value time and functionality. Balancing over nine individual tools in one device ensures you’re not just paying for convenience but long-term efficiency as well. Similar models either fall short on capacity or inflate prices with niche features. This isn’t about luxurious features; it’s about features that make sense for everyday scenarios.

Back in March, I had written: *“Universe, show me a white feather if I’m on the right path.”*

I completely forgot about it… but two days later, while grabbing coffee, there it was — a **big white feather** on the bench I always sit on. At the time, I didn’t think much of it. Looking back now, it feels like one of those little **law of attraction success stories** people always share.

It made me wonder: are these small signs the universe’s way of saying, *“you’re aligned, bigger things are coming”*? Sometimes the tiniest synchronicities — numbers, feathers, random encounters — are the strongest **manifestation signs**.

So I’m really curious… what’s the fastest thing you’ve ever manifested?

* Was it a sign you asked for?
* A person or opportunity that appeared suddenly?
* Or maybe even unexpected money?

In the beginning, it seemed innocent she used to invite me over to eat cake with her and her friends. It felt simple… harmless even. But over time, things started to feel… off.

One day, we had a video call. She didn’t want to turn on her camera, saying her hair was “messy.” Actually, she never wanted to show her face. Later, she told me she had autism according to her, at least.

Our conversations were mostly one-sided. I was always putting in the effort.

We planned to meet at the park once, but she canceled last minute, saying she hurt her leg. Then she started opening up about how her ex abandoned her, how she dated another guy who dumped her, and how she felt constantly rejected.

At that point, I still wanted to be there for her… until the day I got mugged and almost lost her number. She didn’t care. She acted completely indifferent and even said:

> “I won’t text you if you don’t text me.”



That was a red flag, but I ignored it.

She’d talk about her cats, her nephews who also had autism, and once she got furious because her cousin mentioned she used to drink with her ex. Her emotions flipped constantly like a switch.

Eventually, I invited her to the movies, since she always complained we never went out. At first, she said no because she was “too shy.” Then she agreed. But the next day, right before the date, she suddenly dropped:

 “Maybe we should just be friends?”


Still, we went. We met there, bought candy, kissed during the movie, spent the afternoon acting like a real couple. It felt nice  until I realized she wouldn’t let me look at her phone. She refused to give me her Instagram until after we broke up.

Another time, we went to the mall. She gave me a chocolate, and we ended up going to a motel. But the moment we got there, she said she was “too shy” and didn’t want the lights on. I said it was fine… but suddenly, she snapped and her mood flipped again.

We went to the park another day, spent some time together, and when she was heading home, I decided to walk her there. That’s when I noticed something strange she was making it obvious she didn’t want me to meet her family.

Later, her sister once drove her to my place. I made a small joke about how we never went out because she was always “making excuses.” She blew up on me that day.

We played a game together once, I criticized it lightly, and she got mad, stopped playing entirely. Then she brought me chocolate… only to ask for a breakup right after.

She invited me to a party once, then changed her mind, then said she wanted me there again. I got frustrated and asked if she even wanted me around. She said yes, but made it very clear I couldn’t arrive before 6 PM.

I showed up a bit early anyway. Her sister saw me and asked me to come upstairs. We ended up going to her friend’s party together, and there, she introduced me as her boyfriend. I thought, “Finally, some clarity.” But then, out of nowhere, she turned to me and said:

""Should we download a dating app to find you a hot girl?""


I laughed awkwardly, but deep down, I was confused as hell.

Later that night, she wanted me to sleep over. I went home instead. Things started spiraling from there.

After all the mixed signals, I eventually called her and broke up. She started crying, blocked me everywhere, then sent me a long message saying I “sent her to a mental clinic” and “stole her happiness.”

Then… a few days later, she messaged me again, saying she missed me more than she thought she would. Against my better judgment, we started talking again.

And that’s when I found her on a dating app.

When I confronted her, she claimed she was “looking for her friend’s ex.” I didn’t buy it. I got angry, but in the end… I still told her I loved her.

She said she was at a place and wished I was there. Later, she called me, inviting me to her mom’s birthday party. I didn’t go.

The next day, her mom called me personally, asking if I really loved her daughter. Then she invited me for coffee.

We talked again, but soon she told me her dad was angry at me. I vented online about everything that had been happening… and she found my post.

She accused me of using her, lying to her, and manipulating her. Then she said she only acted that way because she was insecure, had autism, and prayed for me every single day.

Then she blocked me everywhere.
And just… disappeared.

📖 Prologue: Final Logoff

Trace Wolfe killed the engine and listened to it tick.

The 1999 Ford Ranger shuddered once, then fell quiet, the old manual transmission winding down with a lazy whine. The truck had been his since high school, gifted from his father, and though its paint had dulled and its odometer turned long past respectable, the machine still carried the weight of memory. His father’s hand on his shoulder the day he drove it off the lot. His father’s laugh when he ground the gears learning stick for the first time. His father’s silence, gone five years now, leaving Trace with only ghosts and steel.

The summer evening pressed heavy on Memphis. Humidity clung like a second skin, a storm front shouldering the horizon with bruised clouds. Heat radiated from the asphalt, carrying the faint, bitter tang of oil and hot metal. The Ranger’s cab smelled of sweat, dust, and the leather cleaner Trace had used religiously, though it hadn’t been new leather in a long time.

He sat a moment longer, hands loose on the wheel, staring through the cracked windshield. Thirty-five years old, sore from another shift inspecting industrial panels, and feeling every day of it. His shoulders ached with the weight of hours bent over wiring and steel. His palms carried the calluses of years spent as mechanic, welder, blacksmith before that. Once, he’d dreamed of work that left room for more than exhaustion. Now he dreamed only of the chair waiting upstairs, and the screen that promised escape.

The storm cracked in the distance, a low growl rolling over rooftops. Trace sighed, shut the truck door, and climbed the narrow stairwell to his apartment.

Inside, the air was still, touched with the faint ozone of electronics. His apartment was neat in the way of someone who lived alone too long: everything in its place, nothing in excess. A desk of dark wood, scarred from years of use. A shelf of well-worn paperbacks: Halo: The Fall of Reach, Mass Effect: Ascension, Destiny: The Taken King lore anthology. Above them, a rack of tools hung like an altar—wrenches, soldering irons, a welder’s mask. Life and escape, side by side.

Trace dropped his keys in a dish by the door, peeled off his work shirt, and sat at his desk. His rig dominated the space, a custom-built tower glowing faintly blue through tempered glass. Cables snaked in careful order, a HOTAS throttle and joystick set beside a mechanical keyboard. Dual monitors waited in black silence.

He touched the power button. Fans whirred, lights pulsed to life, and the room filled with the soft hum of booting hardware. The storm outside dimmed to a low percussion against glass, syncing with the rise of electronic heartbeat.

Trace leaned back, exhaling slow. This was the moment that never lost its edge. The shift from dull reality to something more. He pulled on his headset, bass already thumping with tonight’s playlist—EDM, heavy with synths, the kind that pulsed like engines spooling up. Some nights it was metal, others the hymnal ache of Christian rock his father had left him, still others the raw punch of industrial. But tonight, he needed the hum of thrusters, the promise of speed.

The Star Citizen launcher blinked onto his screen. Loading bar crawled forward, slow as it always did, but anticipation coiled tight in his chest.

When the menus unfurled, he clicked without hesitation. His hangar expanded across the screen—floodlit, cavernous, metal glinting under white brilliance. And there she was.

The Pelican 314.

Trace’s ship stood ready in the bay, sleek and beautiful. Crusader Industries’ Mercury Star Runner, lines smooth as if carved by wind. Deep navy-blue livery gleamed beneath the hangar lights, painted and repainted in hours of tinkering. The name stenciled in white along her flank was simple, unpretentious: Pelican 314.

It wasn’t the biggest ship he owned in-game, nor the deadliest. But it was his. His blood and hours, his every credit saved, his every late-night cargo run. It had carried him through the universe when nothing else had. It was freedom. It was memory. And it was home.

He smiled despite himself.

Sliding into the cockpit view, he let the HUD swallow his monitors. His hands rested on the HOTAS, muscle memory tracing throttle and yaw. The chair creaked under him, familiar and grounding. He whispered it under his breath, as always: “Launch.”

The hangar doors parted. Engines hummed, then roared, the sound rattling through his headset. Light spilled across the cockpit glass as the Pelican rose, carried into the throat of the bay. Beyond, stars scattered across black, endless and bright.

Trace’s chest tightened—not fear, but something like longing. Here, he wasn’t thirty-five and exhausted. Here, he wasn’t a man trapped in the small gravity of his father’s absence and the slow grind of work. Here, he was pilot. Explorer. Someone with control.

His phone buzzed on the desk.

Trace frowned, pulled it closer. Screen black. No notification. But as he stared, a ripple passed across the glass—faint light, blue-white, like veins threading across dark stone. For half a second, he thought he saw letters forming.

Then nothing.

He blinked. “Glitchy piece of junk,” he muttered. The iPhone had been solid since he bought it, but lately… strange. Overheating, flickers, lights where there should be none.

He set it back down. The monitor glow reflected in its surface, making it look like another HUD panel.

His HUD expanded to a full starfield, the Pelican breaking free of the hangar throat. Engines burned steady. Space unfolded before him.

The storm cracked again outside, rattling the window. Lights flickered in his apartment—just once, then steady again. Trace’s pulse hitched.

He eased the throttle forward. The Pelican surged, stars sliding across the canopy. He breathed deep, headset thundering with music, and for a moment the walls of the apartment seemed thinner.

His phone buzzed again. This time, the glow lingered—threads of blue crawling across the screen in slow, deliberate arcs, as if veins of light had begun to root in the glass.

Trace froze.

The HUD flickered, momentarily stuttering. Then the phone’s glow died, leaving silence and shadow.

Trace shook his head, muttered under his breath, and gripped the stick tighter. Whatever it was could wait. He had stars to chase.

The Pelican 314 slid into the void, engines purring.

And behind him, on the desk, his phone pulsed once more, faint but steady, as if keeping time with the beat of his heart.

📖 Prologue: 
Final Logoff



Chunk 2 — The Fracture


The stars bent.

One moment, Trace’s monitors showed the simulated canopy, the gentle crawl of a galaxy. The next, the screen warped, the edges of the HUD distorting as if someone had grabbed reality and twisted.

Trace leaned forward, heart tripping. His rig’s fans spun louder, a grinding pitch that didn’t sound right. Static hissed in his headset, then the throb of his EDM track slowed, warped, like a tape dragged through water.

“What the—”

The phone on his desk pulsed blue, light spilling in brighter arcs, brighter than any notification should ever be. The glass crawled with lines of text too fast to read, symbols dissolving into numbers, then into star maps he half-recognized.

The HUD shook. His chair shook. For a wild second he thought it was the storm outside, power lines humming with a surge. But no—the vibration was in his chest, in the soles of his feet, in the bones of his teeth.

Then the cockpit filled his vision.

Not the screen—the cockpit.

The familiar smell of his apartment—dust, ozone, faint leather cleaner—vanished in a rush of recycled oxygen, sharp and metallic. His hands, clamped on the HOTAS, were gripping not plastic, but steel flight controls, worn smooth by use that wasn’t his. Every panel around him glowed, alive, switches and readouts blinking in sequence. The seat pressed into his back, contoured, padded, real.

Trace’s breath hitched, fogging the canopy glass.

This wasn’t his apartment.

The stars were no longer pixels. They were burning pinpricks in a vast black sky that went on forever.

“What the hell—” His voice caught in his throat.

Alarms shrieked.

The canopy flashed with red warnings. MISSILE LOCK DETECTED.

Trace’s pulse slammed into overdrive. He tore the stick sideways on instinct, the Pelican rolling hard. His stomach dropped, his body dragged against the harness that hadn’t been there seconds ago. A missile streaked past his wing, trailing fire before bursting into fragments.

“Pirates.” The word left his lips like a curse.

Three Cutlass Blacks clawed across his scope, their engines glowing hot against the void. Their guns spat streams of tracer fire that painted the black with golden rain. Shields flared as shots chewed across his bow, rippling like struck water.

Trace’s mouth went dry. This wasn’t a game. There was no respawn, no hangar reset. His ship wasn’t wireframe—it was steel and fuel and him inside it.

Another lock screamed. Trace jerked the stick, the Pelican thrumming as it dove, shields flaring bright. He felt the vibration through his spine, through his teeth.

The dorsal turret rotated on its own. He hadn’t touched the controls.

And it fired.

A stream of blue-white bolts lanced upward, stitching across the lead pirate. The Cutlass spiraled, wing blown away, flames licking vacuum before it spun into debris.

Trace’s eyes widened. “I didn’t—”

“Little busy here,” a voice snapped. Female. Sharp. Sarcastic. “Hope you don’t mind I borrowed the turret.”

Trace’s blood froze.

“Who—who the hell is that?”

“Later. Fly.”

Another missile shrieked across his canopy. Trace yanked the stick, his body slammed by inertia, lungs crushed against the harness. Sweat blurred his vision. He banked hard, skimming the edge of a drifting asteroid, the Pelican’s shields scraping sparks against the rock.

The ventral turret roared, twin bolts catching another pirate square in the cockpit. The ship exploded, shards scattering like shattered glass across black.

Trace’s heart hammered. His fingers shook on the stick, knuckles white. “This—this isn’t happening.”

“Focus, flyboy.” The voice purred now, amused despite the chaos. “Last bandit’s still behind you.”

Trace’s HUD blinked, lock warning escalating into a scream. The third Cutlass bore down, missiles primed, its silhouette a vulture against the stars.

Trace swallowed hard. “Okay… okay…”

He slammed the throttle, engines howling, the Pelican surging forward. The stars streaked. He jinked left, right, weaving through debris fields and missile trails.

The voice cut in again, quick and sharp. “Thirty degrees up, then cut engines on my mark.”

“What? That’s suicide.”

“Trust me.”

Another lock tone. Trace’s throat closed.

“Now!”

He yanked back on the stick, angled the nose up, and slammed the throttle idle. The Pelican bucked, momentum hurling him forward, body straining against straps. The pirate screamed past overhead, overshooting his vector.

“Gotcha,” the voice whispered.

The ventral turret fired. Twin bolts ripped into the pirate’s engines. The Cutlass blossomed in fire, torn apart in silence, fragments scattering into forever.

The warning tones died.

Trace’s chest heaved, every nerve screaming. Sweat poured down his back, soaking his shirt. He loosened his grip on the stick, hands trembling.

The comm crackled, silent except for his own ragged breathing. The stars burned indifferent. His ship drifted, shields flickering.

And then, softly, the voice again.

“See? We make a pretty good team.”

Trace stared at the canopy, at the debris drifting past. His voice came raw. “Who… are you?”

A pause. Almost playful. “Wouldn’t you like to know.”

Then silence.

Trace’s eyes flicked down to the console. His phone—jammed into a data port when the chaos started—still glowed faint blue, threads of light crawling across the glass like veins.

Something was inside his ship. Inside his ship.

And it wasn’t leaving.

📖 Prologue: Final Logoff

Chunk 3 — Chi Ceti IV

The jump tore him into ribbon and decided, at the last second, to be merciful.

Light became pressure became nothing. Then the harness slammed the air out of his chest and the Pelican 314 bucked like a spooked animal reappearing inside its own skin. Trace’s stomach tried to keep going while the rest of him snapped back into place. He gagged once, twice, dragged a breath through a throat full of static.

The canopy held a world.

Blue oceans. Brown-green continents braided with river silver. Cloud-bands curling like white script around a globe too large to ignore. Sunlight made a hard coin out of its limb. Not Stanton. Not Sol.

Somewhere else—so utterly itself that denial felt childish.

He lifted a shaking hand and coaxed the Pelican’s nose up, bleeding momentum until the altitude marker stopped screaming and the atmosphere’s invisible hand loosened at the shield bubble. Systems cascaded from angry red to sulky amber.

QUANTUM DRIVE — OFFLINE
HULL — SCORCHING / MINOR ABRASIONS
SHIELDS — RECALIBRATING (43%)

The comms were already there. Not just noise—voices. Human. Clipped, too calm to be anything but trained.

“—Spartans, break off and return to the Commonwealth. Priority one.”
“MAC coil at eighty—no, eighty-two. One shot, make it count.”
“Seraph squadrons—vector seven-by-twelve. Elevation—”

Trace’s breath hitched. Commonwealth. Spartans. The names lodged in him like old shrapnel that his body recognized before his mind gave permission.

He’d read this battle. He’d pictured it on a bedroom floor under a cheap lamp at two in the morning. He’d flattened dog-ears in those paperbacks and traced lines of dialogue with his thumb.

And here it was, talking over him.

The tactical feed staggered, then locked. A UNSC signature on the far side of the planet snapped into place: COMMONWEALTH. Opposite it—elegant, loathsome, inhuman—an alien hull curved like a scimitar, its ventral bays lit with molten breath. Covenant light carrier, shields bright enough to shame the sun.

Plasma lanced across the void in a slow, unstoppable river. Even half a world away, the sensor wash made Trace’s HUD flinch.

“Deck seven venting—”
“Plating’s blistering—two meters of titanium-A doesn’t mean—”
“MAC coil at ninety—hold your positions!”

UNSC ships didn’t have shields. They never had—not here, not now. Just steel and prayer and the stubbornness to keep shooting. Hearing it was worse than reading it. The helplessness carried in the timbre more than the words.

Trace swallowed down the sudden urge to apologize to no one.

He should have been nothing, a smear of heat in high orbit. But the Pelican 314 drifted where it shouldn’t, wearing the faint shimmer of a shield bubble like contraband. He could feel attention turn without seeing it; the way you feel a room change when someone important walks in.

The phone he’d half-crammed into a diagnostics tray was still wedged by the throttle, its glass quietly breathing veins of blue-white. He realized, with a cold, tidy click, that whatever had puppeted his turrets against the pirates hadn’t been a proper link—more a parasitic borrow, a bleed-through. A hand on the wheel, not a seat behind it.

A voice slid into his ear, thin as wire, amused as sin. “Congratulations. You survived your questionable life choices.”

He flinched so hard the harness squeaked. “Who—what are you?”

“Later. Turn thirty degrees sunward unless you’re married to the idea of becoming plasma graffiti.”

He turned—on instinct, on an old habit of trusting the person who sounds like they already know the answers. A violet spear of heat sawed through where he’d been. The shield skin rippled, the sound of it a delicate hiss that made his teeth ache.

A quiet curse bled over a public UNSC channel, half-muted. “Sir—confirming anomalous reflection on that civilian. Our—our scopes show—”

“Not now,” an older voice cut. “Log it for ONI and focus. Spartans are inbound.”

Trace gripped the yoke until his knuckles went chalk white. He had spent years wishing he could be inside a story; now the story was looking back and counting his teeth. On the far side of the world, the carrier rotated with predatory patience. Its bays brightened to obscene, molten clarity.

“Delta Romeo?” the voice in his cockpit prompted, dry as sun-baked chalk.

He blinked. “What?”

“Do you want to live, or do you just enjoy heavy breathing under pressure?”

“Both.”

“Then plug me in. Properly this time.”

He glanced at the aux slot on the starboard console—the real one with data pins and a physical lock. Not the lip of a tray where a phone could leech power and ride noise. The slot blinked green like an eye that had been open this whole time.

Every instinct screamed at him. You don’t jam unknowns into your engine. You don’t let mystery drive.

Another voice on UNSC command, brittle with adrenaline: “Captain, Covenant carrier is—uh—shifting. It looks like something else got its attention.”

Something else. Him. The idea landed with a sick, cold weight.

“Trace,” the voice said, dropping the sarcasm to a scalpel-fine thread of urgency. “Now.”

He tore the phone free and slid it into the starboard port. Magnets caught with a satisfying, terrible click. For a heartbeat nothing happened; the ship breathed, the world curved, plasma crawled across someone else’s sky.

Then the Pelican 314 woke up.

The cockpit light deepened into a cooler temperature, blue-white like arc welders. HUD elements crisped from “game clean” to “surgical.” Power busses rerouted themselves with the certainty of a hand that had done it before, always, forever. Capacitors sang—bright, hungry. Dorsal and ventral turrets rotated together like owls turning their heads.

Her voice—because there was no way to pretend it was mere sound now—came through clear and close, confidence edged sharp. “Strap in.”

Three Seraphs sliced over the planet’s limb like throwing stars, vectors converging. The dorsal turret wrote a straight-line sentence across the nearest one, punctuation in bright, ruinous bursts. Shields flared. Metal went to glass. The craft tried to decide which way was forward and failed.

The ventral turret chased the second, patient and bored, firing a staccato that sounded like someone tapping a pencil exactly where it would be most annoying. The Seraph folded. The third widened its arc, reconsidering its life choices.

“Who are you?” Trace asked, because it seemed like a good time to be stupid.

“Someone with standards,” she said, and it felt like a smile without teeth. “Fly the bus. I’ll shoot.”

The bus. He would have argued if his hands weren’t busy being an extension of a fuselage he suddenly trusted more than his own legs. He skimmed the high blue filament of the atmosphere, let gravity tug just enough to smear the Seraphs’ clean turns, then kicked the nose and found the gap you only get when your enemy has to think like a manual.

Plasma flashed. Heat scuffed the shield skin. Warnings stacked neatly, politely.

SHIELDS — 39%
PORT ENGINE — TEMPERATURE HIGH (CAUTION)

UNSC wideband snapped his attention sideways. “Unidentified civilian craft, this is UNSC Destroyer Commonwealth. State your designation.”

Reflex rose up like old music. He almost said Trace Wolfe because it felt truer, more human—but the chaos dragged his gamer past out of him faster than sense could keep up.

“This is—Deathrun147,” he blurted, hating it the instant it was sound. “Registry Pelican 314.”

Silence, two beats long. Then the clipped, inevitable translation of a machine called a navy: “Acknowledged, Deathrun147. Callsign Delta Romeo One-Four-Seven. Form on vector two-six-niner carom eight. You are drawing enemy attention. Stay mobile and stay clear of our firing solutions.”

Her laugh chimed through the ship like a thrown coin. “Alphabet soup. Look at you—official.”

“It’s not my name,” he muttered, hauling them down the vector. Atmosphere licked the shield skin, hiss like summer rain on a tin roof.

“It is to them,” she said. “I’ll call you Trace.”

He opened his mouth, closed it. “You—know my name.”

“You said it earlier. Screamed it, really. Implied context: ‘Trace, don’t be an idiot.’ You were the audience.”

Heat shimmered; the horizon flexed. Seraphs tried to follow through friction and failed. The dorsal turret cupped a shot around one, ventral clipped another just as it began to find a solution. The wreckage wrote commas across the sky.

The Commonwealth spoke again, a different voice now—older, with a steel edge that remembered cigarettes and bad coffee. “Delta Romeo One-Four-Seven, this is Captain Wallace. ONI will want what you’ve got. Until they pry it from my cold hands, you fly our sky.”

“Copy,” Trace said, and surprise made it honest. “Copy, Captain.”

“Live long enough to be debriefed.”

“Working on it.”

MAC coils wound up. He didn’t hear them so much as feel the universe make room. Across the far curve of the world, the carrier turned its wounded attention fully, ventral bays brightening until they hurt to look at. Trace felt small in a way he’d thought he knew from being human and wrong about the scale of things.

“Trace.” Her voice again, softer, almost intimate inside the noise. “Do exactly what I say.”

He did—up two, drop three, wobble like he was blacking out, sell the easy kill. A Seraph dove with greed. The dorsal mount murdered it with one contemptuous burst.

“You’re enjoying this,” he said, and it wasn’t an accusation.

“I enjoy competence. Don’t make me regret investing.”

Alarms climbed. The carrier’s plasma torpedo launched, a slow sun uncoupling from a larger one. It carved a lazy arc meant to mock speed by making it irrelevant. His shield bubble would take it once, maybe, but the ship behind the bubble would not.

“Brace,” she said, and the word made his hands sweat more than the torpedo did.

Dorsal and ventral weapons charged, amperage screaming down conduits in a way that would have made any engineer in him flinch. She fired them so the beams crossed, lancing the torpedo at a geometric center as impossible to eyeball as it was inevitable to calculate.

Light. Heat. The gut-deep whomp of a small sun deciding not to be born.

Trace blinked spots out of the world and found himself alive.

The Commonwealth’s comms forgot to be professional for half a second. “What the hell was that?”

“Teamwork,” he heard himself say. His mouth was too dry for irony, but it came anyway.

“Good hunting,” Captain Wallace said after a heartbeat. Professionalism returned and wore the smallest smile. “You just bought us our shot.”

The MAC coil sang at the far edge of the sky. The slug moved like faith—seen only by its effects. The carrier’s shields flared to furious bloom and then, finally, failed. Tungsten cored the belly of a god and made it bleed.

Cheering burst over UNSC channels, human and ugly and perfect. Orders drowned it a beat later. Trace realized he was laughing, a cracked sound that felt like something loosening where fear had lived too long in too short a time.

“Delta Romeo One-Four-Seven,” Wallace again, all steel. “Form up on our outbound. We’re not dying here today. Neither are you.”

“Copy.” He meant it with a sincerity that surprised him.

He slid the Pelican 314 into the vector the destroyer threw him, a big ship making a hole in the bad weather for a smaller one to fly through. His shield skin whispered against atmosphere like the sea shushing a child. The turrets tracked and settled, lion tails switching at flies.

He looked down—at the phone now more conduit than device, glass faceted with threads of blue-white that pulsed at something like a pulse. He wanted to ask for a name. He wanted to make one up, as if the act could make anything normal.

Instead: “You still with me?”

A pause that might have been affection wearing irritation. “Obviously.”

“Thank you,” he said, because there was nothing else sane to say.

“Earn it,” she said, and if sarcasm could be fond, hers was.

The planet turned under them, minding its own weather. The Commonwealth limped and hunted. The carrier bled light and hate. Somewhere in the middle of all that, a man in a ship that shouldn’t exist—and a voice that had decided to move in—threaded the sky on a vector he hadn’t chosen and maybe needed anyway.

For a brief and holy moment, Trace let himself breathe.

He was not done. Not safe. But he was alive.

“Delta Romeo One-Four-Seven,” came a last addendum from the bridge, the concern tucked neatly behind control. “Stay clear of our firing solution—and don’t make my gunners nervous.”

“Understood,” he said, and smiled because he could.

He glanced once more at the glass in the console.

“If you have a name,” he said—quiet, to the humming of his ship—“I’ll use it.”

Silence stretched, an elastic band he didn’t realize he was holding until it released.

“Later,” she said at last, and he heard the grin he’d eventually learn could cut and comfort in equal measure. “Survive the next five minutes, then you can ask me cute questions.”

He laughed, helpless, and let the Pelican slide a little closer to Commonwealth’s shadow, where armor and will could sometimes stand in for the shield he wore like a challenge to the universe.

Out of the fire, he thought, not yet knowing the punchline.

The frying pan waited with patience only wars and gods possess.

📖 Prologue: 
Final Logoff



Chunk 4 — Out of the Fire


The Pelican 314 rode tight on the Commonwealth’s vector, a sparrow in the shadow of a predator. Trace kept one eye on the nav plot, the other on the carrier’s slow, hateful turn. Every instinct said to run—burn the quantum drive, fold space, vanish. But the HUD still blinked amber where it should have glowed green: QUANTUM DRIVE OFFLINE. No way out.

The destroyer’s coils screamed higher, tungsten round spooling energy the way thunder stacks in stormclouds. Trace could feel it even at this distance, vibration more bone than sound. The Covenant carrier rotated, its prow angling, weapons bays glowing brighter—an executioner raising a blade.

And then the worst happened.

Its attention snapped directly to him.

Trace knew before his sensors showed it. That sick, slow chill that meant someone had not only spotted you but chosen you. The carrier’s ventral cannon bled heat. Fighters peeled from its bays, purple wings curling toward his position like knives loosed from the sheath.

He swore, pulled the Pelican into a hard bank. “Uh, your big ugly just decided I’m the more interesting target!”

UNSC channels crackled, overlapping chatter.
“Confirm anomalous shielding—”
“They’re ignoring us?”
“No—they’re tracking him.”
“Captain, orders?”

Wallace’s voice cut through, steel and smoke: “Hold position. Let him draw them. Spartans are en route—Commonwealth needs a clean shot.”

Trace barked a laugh that wasn’t humor. “Oh great, I’m bait.”

“You’re alive,” she countered from his own cockpit, her voice as level as if she were reading shopping lists. “Try to maintain that status.”

The first Seraph made a run, energy weapons sparking across his forward shields. Warning tones cascaded. FRONT ARC SHIELDS — 24%.

“Your bus can take more,” she said, calm to the point of cruel.

“You’re not the one strapped into it!”

“I’m everywhere else. Keep flying.”

Turrets roared, precise. One Seraph went down in silent flame. The others adapted, sweeping into a spiral attack vector, careful, coordinated. He felt his jaw set, fingers trembling but steady.

The UNSC comm cut through again. “Delta Romeo One-Four-Seven, you are ordered to maintain your current trajectory. You’re buying us the shot we need.”

Trace wanted to scream at them, to demand they remember he wasn’t military. But some part of him—the mechanic, the player, the man too stubborn to quit—just answered. “Copy, Commonwealth. Holding vector.”

The voice in his console snorted, sarcastic even under plasma fire. “Listen to you. Soldier-boy.”

“Shut up,” he muttered, hauling them through a corkscrew to shake another salvo. Sweat blurred his vision. His lungs burned. The carrier’s glow filled half the sky now, the plasma it was coiling so vast it seemed to bend light.

And then—

The Commonwealth’s MAC gun fired.

It wasn’t sound, wasn’t light. It was the absence of both, the way air stills before a storm. Then the slug blurred across the void, a line so perfect it shamed geometry. It struck dead center. Shields shattered in violet flame. Armor peeled open. The Covenant carrier convulsed as if some god had driven a spear through its belly.

Trace screamed—not words, just release—as UNSC comms erupted in human voices. Cheers, curses, half-choked sobs.

The destroyer’s secondary batteries stitched burning punctuation into the carrier’s wounds. The great ship began to list, ventral bays collapsing inward. Fighters scattered. The light bleeding from its hull dimmed, ember to ash.

The comms went quiet in the way only aftermath can. Then Wallace again: “Delta Romeo One-Four-Seven… you bought that shot. Commonwealth thanks you.”

Trace swallowed hard, the words landing heavier than they should. “…Copy that, Captain.”

“ONI will want a full debrief. Until then—you stay with us.”

“Understood.”

The Pelican 314 slid closer to the destroyer, dwarfed but alive, its shield skin still flickering in stubborn defiance.

Trace slumped in his harness, every muscle screaming, chest heaving. He let his hand drift across the console to where the phone—no, the presence inside it—still pulsed faintly. Blue-white threads crawled the glass like veins.

“You still with me?” he whispered.

The reply came smooth, sarcastic, and yet—beneath it—warm. “Obviously. If I left, you’d be paint on someone’s hull.”

He let out a shaky laugh, half-crazed, half-grateful. “Guess I owe you.”

“You have no idea,” she said, almost purring. “Now fly your bus. We’ve only just started.”

Trace leaned back, stared past the canopy at the ruined Covenant hulk drifting silent. The UNSC destroyer loomed, battered but burning steady. He should have felt safe. Instead he felt the ground dropping out again.

1mvgwf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1mvgwf0/can_bastion_probiotic_enzyme_cleaner_really/,Can Bastion Probiotic Enzyme Cleaner Really Remove Deep Odors,"I got my hands on the Bastion Probiotic Enzyme Cleaner recently, and as someone who always has an arsenal of cleaning products at home, I was intrigued by the idea of a natural, bio-enzymatic cleaner. Let me tell you, cleaning with technology-driven products has always been a hit or miss, but this one brought something unique to the table. With its promise to handle stains, odors, and grime on multiple surfaces without relying on harsh chemicals, I couldn’t wait to give it a proper test.  

**Design and Formula**  
The cleaner comes in a generously sized one-gallon bottle, and I appreciated the ready-to-use formula. No mixing, measuring, or diluting is required. You literally just grab your spray bottle, apply, and let the probiotics and enzymes do their thing. The product claims that it leaves no residue—no film, no streaks, just clean surfaces—and I found this to be true for the most part. After cleaning up a coffee spill on my living room rug (thank you, clumsy me), there was no stickiness left behind. The natural formula stands out because it’s free from bleach, chlorine, or toxic chemicals, making it a safer option for families with kids and pets.  

**Performance and Effectiveness**  
I have to admit, I wasn’t entirely convinced that enzymes and probiotics could handle tough stains and smells effectively. But after tackling a series of cleaning challenges, like wine stains on the kitchen counter and pet urine mishaps on the carpet, I was seriously impressed. The enzymes broke everything down efficiently, while the live cultures in the formula went to work on the odors. It even worked wonders on the grout in my tiled kitchen floor, where stuck-on grime usually seems invincible. The results weren’t instant—you do need to give the formula time to “digest” stains—but patience made all the difference here.  

**Highlights**  
- The probiotic technology makes it feel futuristic yet eco-friendly.  
- Works on an impressive variety of surfaces: carpets, countertops, toilets, laundry, and more.  
- Absolutely no harsh chemical smell; instead, a mild and clean scent that isn’t overpowering.

**Practicality for Daily Use**  
Having used chemical-laden cleaners in the past, I was a bit wary about how this natural solution would hold up. Surprisingly, it’s become my go-to cleaner for quick spills as well as deep cleaning days. No need to rinse after application also saves time, which is a massive win for busy households like mine. I even tried it on my toddler’s high chair for some dried-on food stains, and not having to worry about residue or harmful chemicals felt like a weight off my shoulders.  

**Family-Friendly Features**  
As a parent, I’m always skittish about using products that might be safe for surfaces but dangerous for little hands. The Bastion cleaner is hypoallergenic and non-toxic, so using it all over my home, be it the couch or the dog’s favorite nap spot, gave me a lot of peace of mind. Pets and kids traipsed over newly cleaned surfaces with no issues, which is a huge plus.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Hypoallergenic and safe for humans, animals, and the environment.  
- Long-working formula remains active for up to 80 hours after use.  
- Eco-conscious design leaves no footprint on the planet.  

**Downsides**  
Of course, nothing’s perfect, and this cleaner has a few quirks.  
- It requires time to work thoroughly, so it’s not for anyone expecting instant gratification.  
- Though “ready to use,” pouring it into my spray bottle was a bit clumsy due to the gallon size—the option of smaller bottles might be helpful.  
- Tougher stains may need repeated applications before you see magic happen.  

**Competing Products**  
I compared the Bastion Probiotic Enzyme Cleaner to some enzyme-based sprays in my cupboard, like Rocco & Roxie’s, and chemical cleaners such as Lysol. While the Bastion cleaner didn’t have the same aggressive stain-lifting speed as harsher formulas, it outshined in creating a safer, family- and planet-friendly lifestyle. The odor-removing capability also felt more robust than some of the competitors, which tend to just mask smells rather than remove them entirely. That said, some alternatives come with added scents or quick-drying formulas, which might appeal to those who want something ultra-quick.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
This cleaner may seem like an investment at first, but the enormous gallon bottle, versatility, and long-lasting active formula make it well worth it. Considering you don’t need multiple cleaners for different surfaces, this one product can basically replace several bottles under the sink.

1mvgtxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mvgtxm/does_the_szhetefu_12oz_french_press_coffee_maker/,Does the SZHETEFU 12oz French Press Coffee Maker Deliver a Perfect Brew Review?,"The SZHETEFU 12ozFP-01 French Press caught my eye because I’ve always been a fan of finding compact but robust tools for my coffee routine. With kids running around in the morning and a tight schedule, having an efficient and practical French press is non-negotiable for me. After testing it extensively, I can confidently say it's a nifty coffee maker with notable strengths and some areas that could benefit from improvement.

**Compact and Elegant Design**  
My first impression of this 12-ounce French press was its sleek silver matte finish paired with a double-layered stainless steel body. Its compact dimensions—measuring 3.01""D x 5.47""W x 6.48""H—make it ideal for small kitchens or limited counter space. The design isn’t just visually appealing; it's incredibly functional too. I found the lid fits snugly, which reduced spills even when my toddler decided to tug at the table while I poured my coffee.

**Positives**  
The functional design and attention to detail truly stood out as I started using this petite coffee maker regularly.  
- **Portable and lightweight**, making it excellent for camping trips or that early-morning commute caffeine fix.  
- Keeps coffee **warm for up to two hours** thanks to the insulated double-layer construction, which is perfect for lazy weekends.  
- Cleaning and reassembling the components are a breeze, with a threaded rod top already secured for convenience.  

[Check SZHETEFU 12ozFP-01 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0ddt44xv1/)  

**Brewing and Flavor**  
Being a French press, the brewing method requires coffee grounds to steep fully in the water. This brewing style genuinely unlocks rich, smooth flavors, and I appreciated the flexibility to adjust brewing times to my preferred strength. One thing I loved experimenting with was the variety of coffee beans I had stockpiled, and using this press allowed their unique profiles to truly shine. For latte or cappuccino fans, simply pour in milk—it even keeps it comfortably warm without reheating.  

**Who’s It For?**  
As someone who adores specialty coffee but doesn’t always have the time to fiddle with high-maintenance machines, this product is a gem. I would recommend it for solo coffee drinkers, minimalist households, and on-the-go coffee enthusiasts. Its 12oz capacity generally accommodates 1–2 cups, which also helps manage my coffee intake throughout the day (when I’m not overly caffeinated, parenting feels much more manageable).

**Drawbacks**  
Although it has a lot to offer, there are a few things that might bother other users or, truthfully, did annoy me slightly.  
- You’ll need **precision with grind size**; too fine, and the grounds might sneak past the filter.  
- It’s slightly bulky for such a small capacity, so if you’re someone who measures travel gear by weight, it might be a consideration.  
- Wishing there was a measuring scoop included could’ve made the setup easier for beginners.  

**Competitive Options**  
Given its price range and functionality, the SZHETEFU stands confidently among its competitors, such as the Bodum Chambord and Stanley Classic Travel Press. The Chambord offers a more classic glass design but lacks the insulation features, making the temperature retention of the SZHETEFU superior. The Stanley Classic, on the other hand, also boasts rugged durability but tilts slightly heavier, which might turn off ultralight travelers. Where the SZHETEFU excels is certainly in its multipurpose design, and its stainless steel finish feels sturdier than the competitors’ glass options.

**Price Performance**  
When considering the price, it does offer impressive **value for its durability** and functionality. You get a machine designed with a purpose, particularly tailored for coffee aficionados who need something portable and reliable. It’s worth noting how it competes well within its price category compared to others, particularly because of its thoughtful engineering—like that snug stopper design, which minimizes coffee grounds ending up in your cup.

I’m a 27-year-old creative soul who thrives on new ideas, new places, and meaningful connections. I live in the world of fashion and photography—always chasing good light, good coffee, and good conversations.

Maybe you’ve tried different side hustles already—delivering food, [freelancing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-freelancer-and-make-money/), selling [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)—but the results just aren’t adding up to that first big milestone: $5,000.

# Why This Side Hustle Works So Well Right Now

Businesses of every size need help [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/). Small shops, local restaurants, solo entrepreneurs, even creators on [social media](https://tchelete.com/best-social-media-marketing-tools-you-should-know/)—most don’t have the time, patience, or know-how to manage everything themselves. They’re desperate for affordable help.

That’s where this side hustle comes in. You pick a service (like managing [social media](https://tchelete.com/best-social-media-marketing-tools-you-should-know/) accounts, writing blog posts, creating simple graphics, editing short videos, or setting up email newsletters) and you offer it to people who can’t or don’t want to do it themselves.

Here’s why it works:

* **Low barrier to entry** – You don’t need a degree or fancy equipment. A laptop and an internet connection is enough.
* **High demand** – Businesses are shifting online more than ever, and they need freelancers to help them keep up.[](https://systeme.io/?sa=sa0036022176932279ade69fe2023d810d1f3ff284)
* **Scalable income** – You can start small, but once you gain confidence and experience, you can raise your rates and take on bigger projects.

# The $5,000 Roadmap

Let’s break it down step by step so it feels doable.

# 1. Pick One Simple Service

Don’t try to do everything. Choose one skill that you can either learn quickly or that you already have. Some of the fastest to get started with include:

* Social media management (posting, responding to comments, basic growth strategies)
* Short-form video editing (think TikTok or Instagram Reels)
* Simple website setup (using platforms like Wix or WordPress)
* Copywriting (writing emails, blog posts, or product descriptions)
* Canva design (basic flyers, social media graphics, or presentations)

If you’re not sure which to choose, go with the one that feels the least overwhelming to you. You can always expand later.

**Get Started** — [**bit.ly/systemeioaffiliatez**](https://systeme.io/?sa=sa0036022176932279ade69fe2023d810d1f3ff284)

# 2. Learn Just Enough to Get Started

You don’t need to become an expert before you start. Watch a few tutorials, practice a bit, and you’ll know more than most of the people hiring you. Remember, clients don’t care about certifications—they care about results.

# 3. Find Your First Client

This is where most people get stuck. But landing your first client is simpler than it seems:

* **Start local.** Ask small businesses in your area if they need help with social media or content. Most will say yes.
* **Use freelancing platforms.** Sites like Upwork, Fiverr, or Contra connect you with people looking to hire right now.
* **Network casually.** Tell friends and family what you’re doing—you’d be surprised how quickly someone knows someone who needs help.

# 4. Charge Fair, But Don’t Undersell

At first, your goal is momentum, not perfection. If you charge $200 per project and finish just one project a week, you’re at $800 a month. Double that, and you’re close to $2,000. Keep stacking, and $5,000 comes into view quickly.

# 5. Build on Small Wins

Every time you finish a project, ask for a testimonial. Use that to get your next client. As your skills improve, raise your rates. That’s how you move from just “trying” to creating a steady income.

# A Realistic Example

Let’s say you choose short-form video editing. You learn how to edit on CapCut (a free app). You offer to edit 10 TikToks for a local coffee shop for $300. They love it.

You use that work to show another small [business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/) that hires you for $500.

Then a [content creator](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-content-creator-and-make-money/) hires you for $1,000 a month to edit their weekly videos. Suddenly, you’re stacking income streams without needing to “start a [business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/)” in the traditional sense.

Before you know it, you’ve hit that $5,000 mark. Not because you had to go viral, or because you got lucky—but because you picked something simple and followed through.

# FAQs

# 1. Do I need prior experience to get started?

No. Many freelancers begin with zero professional experience. What matters is showing you can do the work. Your first projects can even be unpaid practice examples that you use in a portfolio.

# 2. How fast can I make $5,000?

It depends on how much time you put in. If you dedicate 10–15 hours a week, you could realistically reach $5,000 in a few months. Some people do it faster.

# 3. What if I don’t feel “skilled” at anything?

Pick something you’re curious about and commit to learning. The internet is full of free tutorials. You only need to be one step ahead of the client to be valuable.

# 4. Is this oversaturated?

Not if you niche down. “Video editing” is broad, but “editing short, trendy [Instagram](https://tchelete.com/how-to-grow-your-business-on-instagram/) Reels for fitness coaches” makes you stand out. There’s room for everyone because the [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) world keeps expanding.

# 5. Can this become a full-time income?

Yes. Many freelancers who start with small projects end up building six-figure businesses. But your first $5,000 is the most important—it proves to you that it’s possible.

# Final Thoughts

If you haven’t hit $5,000 yet, the problem isn’t you—it’s just the approach you’ve been trying. Some side hustles take too much time for too little reward. Others depend on luck. But freelance [digital](https://tchelete.com/effective-digital-marketing-strategy/) services are different: they’re straightforward, in demand, and flexible enough to fit into your life.

The only real question is: **what skill are you willing to bet on first?**

Lots of well adjusted guys are struggling with dating without turning to hate.","I'm a 28 year old man who hasn't been in bed with a woman in almost 6 years now, and never had piv sex so am technically a virgin despite having fooled around a couple times. By definition, I am an incel.  I am trying (pretty hard I might add) to find a partner, and have yet to succeed.

When people use the word ""incel"", the connotation is these assumptions that the man is hateful, far right, & misogynistic and hate society and women for them not getting laid.  School shooters, Andrew Tate, & the red pill come to the forefront of the conversation.

My problem with it is I think that while there is an alarming number of men who fit into that mold of radicalized hate towards women for their sexual frustration... there are even more guys who just don't have a girlfriend but would like to.  These are often left-leaning, well educated, young professionals who have a healthy level of empathy towards women, but for a myriad of reasons that are specific to individuals, can't seem to land a relationship despite trying.

It pains me to think that just because I'm not having sex, people assume I'm a far right nationalist who wants to perpetrate violence against women.  I also hate this assumption that I'm not trying then blaming women for my failure.  I'm trying, I've been rejected several dozen times in person this year alone (I'll shoot my shot at coffee shops, parks, bars, concerts, clubs, meetups, and non-quiet sections of libraries) and an uncountable amount online.  I'm also not blaming women for my failure, I recognize that I'm obese and that holds me back, living at home with parents at 28 isn't attractive (despite it being to help be a caretaker for my mother, not due to financial inability to live on my own), and have ADHD/OCD/Anxiety that makes me come across way too eager when first meeting women.  I'm working to address those shortcomings (therap, journaling, mediation, exercise, healthy eating), but that's a long-term process (likely a half decade battle) and I'm not just going to stop trying to put myself out there until I've lost 100 lbs healed all my samskaras, got my adhd fully under control, etc... 

I recognize and appreciate that Iliza Shlesinger threw in the qualifier into her joke that it only applied to people who ""blamed women"" for their lack of sex, but I think the conversation needs to be had that the majority of involuntarily celibate people do not fit into this hyperbolized stereotypical incel identity.

1mvgpxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1mvgpxz/my_body_just_doesnt_allow_sleep_past_5_hours/,My body just doesn’t allow sleep past 5 hours.,"Hello,

I usually don’t have issue falling asleep but always wake up only after 5 hours (or less) without an alarm clock. This has been going on for years (I’m 39 now) and I don’t know how to fix it. I’m scared my body has become too used to surviving on just 5 hours. I don’t actually feel lethargic throughout the day most of the time but I do have my days. I’m also one of those people who never take naps, I don’t even think I could fall asleep in the day unless I was dead tired. I sleep at 11 I wake up around 5, if I sleep at 10 then I wake around 4, I know this is 6 hours but I’m always up an hour before just laying there an hour before looking at said times. Sometimes when I fall asleep a bit later at 1am (which I rarely do because I try to stick to a tight sleep schedule) I still wake up at around 5. Has anyone gone through a similar experience and know how I can break out of this “max 5 hour sleep” routine? I love coffee but now only limit myself to morning coffee once a day, don’t do any strenuous exercise or eat/drink at least 3hrs before sleep, etc but nothing really helps. I’m thinking this might just be the curse of having an anxious mind throughout my days. Thanks for any tips.",1,1755700936.0,sleep,2,0.67,False

1mvgpg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mvgpg6/i_bought_a_house_in_an_abandoned_town_to_get_some/,"I bought a house in an abandoned town to get some peace. I think it's ""fixing"" me instead","I don’t know why I’m writing this. I’m not a forum guy. But I’m alone out here and I have to tell someone, anyone. Just to get it out of my own head. So if I do go crazy, at least there’s a record of it.

I torched my life about a month ago. Job, apartment, relationship, the whole thing. I’m an architect, or I was. Had a full-blown burnout, the kind that leaves you feeling hollowed out, you know? I just needed quiet. Needed to start over. I found this listing online, a house going for practically nothing. The catch was its location: the middle of nowhere, in a derelict 60s housing development that went bust. The town’s name is Aethelburg. Sounded perfect. A place where the world couldn’t find me.

When I got here, it was even deader than I’d imagined. A ghost town of asphalt and weeds. Perfectly laid-out streets that lead nowhere, rusted streetlights standing like skeletal sentinels. All the houses are identical, these sad little copy-pasted boxes, all of them empty and rotting. Except mine. Mine was… clean. Too clean. Like someone had been here a week ago and scrubbed the place down.

The first few days were bliss. The silence. I’d forgotten what real silence was. Not city-quiet, which is just a low hum. This was a deep, heavy quiet that felt like it was pressing on my eardrums. I started unpacking, slowly. Starting to feel human again.

That’s when the little things started.

The first thing, it was a picture frame. An old photo of my parents. I’d put it on the mantelpiece over the brick fireplace. One evening, I’m walking to the kitchen to get a drink. I stop. I pick up the frame, and I move it. Maybe four inches to the left.

The thing is, I don’t remember deciding to do it. My hand just… did it. Like an autopilot thing, you know? Like when you’re driving and you suddenly realize you don’t remember the last five miles. But after I did it, after the frame was in its new spot, I felt this wave of… calm. Relief. Like an itch I didn’t know I had was finally scratched. I figured, okay, whatever. Stress. Nerves. It’s a new place. I’m just settling in.

A few nights later, I woke up. Not because of a noise. I just… woke up. Eyes wide open in the pitch black. I wasn’t in my bed. I was standing in the kitchen. The linoleum was ice-cold under my feet. It took me a second to figure out where I was. I hadn’t turned on the light. The only light was the pale moonlight filtering through the window over the sink.

And I saw what I’d done.

Every can of food I owned. I’d taken every single one out of the pantry. Tuna, corn, beans, soup, all of it. And I’d stacked them. Not just in a pile. I’d built a perfect, symmetrical pyramid on the countertop. It was flawless.

I have no memory of doing this. None. The last thing I remember is reading in bed and turning off the light.

And the scariest part, the part that’s really messing with my head, is that my first reaction wasn’t fear. It was satisfaction. I looked at that pyramid of cans in the dark and some quiet, calm part of my brain just went, *“There. That’s better.”*

The panic didn’t hit until I was back in bed, shivering. Am I sleepwalking? I’ve never sleepwalked in my life. But maybe stress can trigger it? A new environment? I kept trying to find a logical reason. I had to. Because the alternative was just… not possible.

But it kept happening. It’s still happening.

I’m not just sleepwalking anymore. I find myself doing things during the day. I’ll be in the middle of something, and I’ll just… zone out. I’ll come to, and I’ll find I’ve spent the last hour organizing the books on my shelves. Not by author, not by title. By the exact shade of their color, from lightest to darkest. I found myself on my hands and knees in the bathroom, scrubbing the grout between the tiles with a toothbrush until it was pristine white. I don’t remember starting. I just “wake up” in the middle of it, my back aching, with that same weird, creepy feeling of a job well done.

I’m becoming obsessive. That’s the only rational explanation. The isolation is getting to me, triggering some latent OCD I never knew I had. My whole day is consumed by it now. Everything has to be perfect. Symmetrical. If a coaster is off-center on the coffee table, it’s not just annoying. It feels… wrong. Physically wrong. I get this knot in my stomach, this rising anxiety that doesn’t go away until I fix it.

The problem is, it’s working. The burnout, the anxiety, the reason I came here in the first place… it’s gone. It’s been replaced by this… this obsession with order. It’s like my brain has traded one illness for another. And the new one is so much quieter. So much calmer.

I tried to fight it. I swear I did. Three days ago, I decided, fuck this. I’m not a slave to this. I deliberately messed up the living room. I left a coffee cup on the floor. I tossed a book onto the sofa instead of putting it back on the shelf. I tried to just live in it. To be a normal, messy human being.

I thought I was going to die.

It started with a headache. A dull throb behind my eyes. Then a noise started. A low, deep hum. So low it was more of a feeling than a sound. It was like the house was vibrating. It made my teeth ache. I lay on my bed for hours, curled up in a ball, sweating, the pressure in my head building and building. I felt like my skull was going to crack open.

I couldn’t take it. Around dawn, I gave up. I got up, my head pounding, and I cleaned the living room. I put the cup in the sink. I put the book back on the shelf, in its correct color-coded spot. I straightened the rug.

The second I finished, the instant the room was back in perfect order, it stopped. The headache vanished. The humming cut out. Just… silence. And that wave of calm washed over me again.

It’s not just in my head. It can’t be. OCD doesn’t give you a physical, vibrating hum in your house. It doesn’t stop the second you align your books. This is something else. This house, this place… it’s not just a building. It’s a system. And it has rules. And I’m learning that breaking them has consequences.

And then tonight happened. The thing that made me write this.

I was in the bathroom, washing my face. I looked up at my reflection in the mirror. And I saw my hand. My right hand. It started to lift.

I didn’t tell it to. I tried to stop it. I swear to God, I focused all my will on telling my arm to stay down. But it was like it wasn’t mine anymore. It was like watching someone else’s arm, attached to my shoulder. It moved slowly, deliberately.

I watched, frozen in horror, as my own index finger touched my forehead. And it started to draw. An invisible pattern on my own skin. A spiral, with straight lines coming off it, like a stylized sun. I could feel the light pressure of my own nail. I was staring at my own eyes in the mirror, wide with terror, and I couldn't do a single thing to stop it. I was a prisoner in my own body.

It probably lasted ten seconds. It felt like an hour.

Then it stopped. My arm dropped to my side. I had control again. I shakily raised my other hand to my forehead. There was nothing there. No mark. No scratch.

But I know what happened. I saw it. I felt it.

It’s not just about the things in the house anymore. It’s not about arranging books or cans. It’s started arranging *me*.

I should leave. I know that. A sane person would be packing a bag right now and driving until the sun came up. But I can’t. The thought of leaving this house, of leaving anything out of place… it fills me with a kind of dread that’s worse than the fear. The thought of the headache, of the humming…

And there’s something else. The real reason I’m still here.

Since this started, since I’ve been following these… rituals. I’ve been productive. I’m an architect. I design things. I hadn’t been able to draw a straight line for six months. My creativity was gone, burned out.

The other night, after one of the arranging episodes, I sat down at my drafting table. And I started to draw. It just… flowed out of me. The lines were perfect. The concepts were clear, brilliant. In a few hours, I’d designed a structure more elegant and complex than anything I’d managed in my entire career. It was effortless. I wasn’t even thinking. I was just the hand holding the pencil.

I looked at the finished drawing, and I felt that same, familiar feeling. That deep, profound satisfaction. The feeling of perfect order.

I think I understand now. This house isn’t haunting me. It doesn’t want to hurt me.

It’s fixing me.

It’s taking all the messy, chaotic, human parts of me—the anxiety, the depression, the unpredictable spark of creativity—and it’s cleaning them up. It’s sanding them down. It’s putting them in order. It’s emptying me of the chaos and filling me with… purpose. With structure.

And that’s the part that terrifies me more than anything else.

A part of me wants to let it. A part of me is so tired of the mess.",12,1755700904.0,nosleep,7,0.93,False

Possets (***take all FS + samples for $75 total***)

* $20 **The Magnificent Red Rose** (6ml oil) - When you are thinking of things spiritual, I always like to have a flower around me. Of course, in a perfect world there would be perfectly beautiful hybrid tea red roses with the most sublime perfume. That is what this is, the best rose fragrance I have come up with yet.

It's far more than a single note, and with a good deal more depth and character than any other rose fragrance I have smelled.
* $20 **Portrait of a Lady** (6ml oil) - My mother adored a good rose perfume. She declared that men just loved it and she always got compliments on it wherever she went. This is a special one which might have been what she wore when she was painted by Galpin. A combination of lovely cupped old roses and modern florist's roses combined with that unique scent of wet stone for balance. She also loved a stone-like scent and this one would have been a favorite of hers.
* $20 **Isabella** (6ml oil) - Notes of rose are combined with a light resin, white tea leaf and a rare honey/milky-musk. This one starts off as demure and gradually becomes more and more seductive as it warms on your skin.

I am not a doctor, trainer, nutritionist, nothing of the sort so I do not want to argue about my strategies, about macros, about this or about that. If I can help one person then my goal is complete . It may not be for everyone but it worked for me!

So with that said let’s crack in. I’m a 35 year old male who had always been in athletic shape. Played d1 golf and division 2 high school athletics . A little less than average height around 5’8 with a compact broad structure. I always hovered around 155-165 , that’s when I felt most “ripped” … in my 30s I started to care less about my body and got up to 210 pounds. That’s heavy for me, the classic big gut feeling sluggish so I finally had enough and wanted to do something about it and this is what I did. I’m going to explain the little details because I think that’s what’s most important

I started my new routine with a 48 hour fast. You don’t have to, but I wanted to shock my body and be in a hard calorie deficit going into a daily calorie deficit of eating if that makes sense

1. I held myself accountable, if you don’t you will inevitably fail. Let’s face it, eating food that taste great but packs on pounds is a lot easier and funner(is this a word lol) than restrictive eating and working out.

2. I live a busy life - meal prep and cooking aren’t my strengths but I found ways around that. I weighed everything, kept it right on my kitchen counter. 

3. I told myself every day “I’m going to the gym” even on days I didn’t want to. And believe it or not I ALWAYS felt better after going. 

4. Start with something, anything .. this is a long game not a short fix. I don’t know your situation so make it work. Be deliberate in your intentions. 

5. The food:

Breakfast:
1 scoop whey protein 
2-4 oz Unsweetened vanilla almond milk 
8-10 oz Starbucks medium roast iced coffee . Purchased at local grocery store 

1 nonfat market basket brand (that’s the local grocery in my state) plain Greek yogurt 
Mixed in 1 serving of Jif peanut butter.

I bought the whey protein at a vitamin shop. I buy the coffee and almond milk at the grocery store
I buy the 1 serving cups of the Greek nonfat instead of the bigger container. I buy 7 a week, one a day boom it’s quick. I weigh out the peanut butter every morning 

Lunch:
5 ounces of COOKED skinless boneless chicken breast 

1 cup of minute brown rice. Probably not the best option because of sodium but for me the convenience factor outweighs minimal gain nutritionally . Pop it in the microwave boom ready to go. They sell them in packs of 2 at my grocery store. I buy 4 packs at a time , one for every day

Dinner:
5 ounces of COOKED skinless boneless chicken breast 

100 gram romaine lettuce. I don’t include tomato’s, cucumbers etc purely for quickness and convenience . 

30  ml ranch dressing 

I will also sub out chicken here and there for 85% lean ground beef, sirloin steak, salmon etc. I do it in 5oz servings, found that’s the sweet spot for me

Snack:
One Quaker rice crisp caramel 

I only drank water, seltzer waters, 0 calorie Powerade , Diet Coke during the week. No sugary drinks. I don’t care about what ppl say about artificial sweeteners . My life my body, I enjoy Diet Coke, it doesn’t hinder me that much 

I live a social lifestyle. I will stick to this Monday thru Thursday religiously . Friday and Saturday nights I will “loosen” up and ALLOW myself one meal whatever I want whether it’s a breakfast outing w friends or a dinner w family. I will drink Tito’s and soda without counting on the weekends,  I simply don’t care that much , I will have my fun and enjoy my life . The other meals stick to the plan 

This plan is a little high in fat, very calorie restrictive and hard to stick to, but it works for me. I hit my protein goals, keep carbs down and am in a wicked calorie deficit. 

You’re gonna feel hungry. Fight thru it, that’s a good sign. Means your body’s eating fat for energy.

The point is - it’s a plan , I stick to it. Make a plan stick to yours . 

The work outs:

Tailor it to yourself. Find what distances / weight works for you but this is what I do

I google mapped a spot where I can safely and legally park my car 1.5 miles away from my home gym. I park my car , walk 1.5 miles to the gym, workout, walk back 1.5 miles to the car and go home.

I do this because I HATE treadmills, stair masters etc. I find I pass the time much quicker walking in real life.

If you can’t walk far. Do this set a timer on your phone. I don’t care if it’s 5 minutes. Walk 5 min away from your house when it goes off, walk back home. Add a minute every other day. Build routine, get the body moving. Watch your YouTube content on your walk instead of on your couch. 
Between the 3 miles to and from gym and my work activity I’m in the 15k steps a day range.

The work outs :

Back and biceps
Chest and triceps
Legs
Shoulders and traps
Core 

Go online. Research 3 exercises for your back, 3 exercises for your biceps . Start with a weight that you can do 10 reps EASY im talking so EASY. Just get in the damn gym. The next time you’re scheduled to do back and biceps go up in weight.keep doing this until it becomes very difficult to get 10, then go up one more and only do 5. Once you get to this point find weights that are challenging for 8 reps and red line yourself to get 8 achieved 

Do the basic 3x8-10 failure on the last 2 reps

Rinse and repeat  go online etc for every muscle group

I tend to go WAY heavier on legs like squats and dead lifts because it engages the core and really helps the body burn calories . Maybe it’s my imagination but it feels that way and placebo is sometimes good in losing weight / building muscle  

I was at 210 July first I’m at 185 August 20th 

That’s 25 pounds in under two months. I’m leaning out , retaining muscle and keeping that pump

The moral of the story is: do it

On the way back, the car suddenly stalled—almost like how a manual engine would cut off. All the electronics were still running on battery, but the engine was completely off. I quickly veered to the shoulder and stopped.

I tried restarting 3 times—starter motor was cranking but the engine just wouldn’t fire up. After waiting 30 minutes for the recovery truck, I tried again and surprisingly it started right away like nothing happened.

I then drove it to the nearest fuel station, parked for another 30 minutes, and later took it slowly to the dealer as advised. The outside temperature today was 43°C, which might have played a role.

This album was recorded during a turbulent time in American history following the assassinations of US Attorney General Robert Kennedy and civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Max Roach’s initial fame came during the bebop era, playing with Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, and many other musicians. His artistic expression has grown significantly beyond his earlier Civil Rights-era works, including the famous “We Insist” album, and now encompasses even more progressive projects, like this one. These musicians, who helped to shape the sound of 70s jazz. This recording highlights the musical talents of alto saxophonist Gary Bartz, trumpeter Charles Tolliver, pianist Stanley Cowell, bassist Jymie Merritt (a familiar face with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers), and vocalist Andy Bey, who later joined Horace Silver and lends his voice to the title track. The style is strongly reminiscent of Bartz’s earlier work with Milestone records, or some Strata East releases by Cowell and Tolliver. Given his talent, it’s unsurprising Cowell contributed 3 tracks to the set: “Effi”, “Equipoise”, and “Abstrutions”. The group also delivers a great rendition. During this session, Jymie Merritt, the bassist, wrote “Absolutions,” which was later recorded by the Lee Morgan’s quintet for Blue Note Records at the Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach, California, in 1970.

This baseline is your **Basal Metabolic Rate**, or **BMR**.

Think of your BMR as the number of calories your body burns just to keep the lights on—powering essential functions like breathing, circulating blood, and keeping your brain ticking, even if you were to lie in bed all day. It’s the absolute minimum energy you need to stay alive.

Getting this number right is the foundation of any solid nutrition plan. From there, we'll factor in your activity level to find your *true* daily calorie needs, often called your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).

# Your Body's Baseline: Understanding BMR

To get a reliable estimate of your BMR, experts turn to a couple of trusted formulas. The most common and scientifically validated ones are the Mifflin-St Jeor and Harris-Benedict equations. While they sound complicated, they're just using a few key pieces of information about you to do the math.

# Key Variables in BMR Formulas

Both formulas rely on the same core biological data points to calculate your metabolic rate. Here’s what they look at and why it matters:

* **Gender:** Men generally have a higher BMR because they tend to have more muscle mass and less body fat than women.
* **Weight:** Heavier bodies require more energy to function, plain and simple.
* **Height:** Taller people have a larger body surface area, which typically results in a higher BMR.
* **Age:** Our metabolism naturally begins to slow down as we get older, so age is a critical piece of the puzzle.

These factors together determine your Basal Energy Expenditure (BEE), which is just the clinical term for the calories needed for your body's most basic, non-negotiable functions.

>

# Choosing the Right Formula

So which formula should you use? While both are respected, most current research points to the **Mifflin-St Jeor equation** as being more accurate for the majority of people when compared to the older Harris-Benedict formula. It's why you'll find it's the standard in most modern health and fitness tools.

Instead of crunching the numbers yourself, you can get a quick and reliable estimate using our [**health calculator**](https://dietfit.appsfy.ai/health-calculator).

Once you have your BMR, you’ve built a solid foundation. The next step is to account for your daily movement to find your personalized daily calorie target.

# Putting BMR Formulas into Practice

Alright, theory is great, but let's get our hands dirty and actually run the numbers. This is where the rubber meets the road—taking the BMR formulas and turning them into a real, practical starting point for your daily calorie needs.

We'll use both the Mifflin-St Jeor and Harris-Benedict formulas to see them in action. Just remember, these equations were designed with metric units, so the first thing you'll always need to do is a quick conversion of your weight and height.

* **Weight:** Pounds (lbs) ÷ **2.20462** = Kilograms (kg)
* **Height:** Inches × **2.54** = Centimeters (cm)

Let's walk through it together with a couple of clear examples.

# A Real-World BMR Calculation for a Man

Let's imagine a guy named Mark. He’s a **35-year-old**, stands **6 feet tall (72 inches)**, and weighs **190 pounds**.

First, we'll convert his stats over to metric:

* Weight: 190 lbs ÷ 2.20462 = **86.2 kg**
* Height: 72 inches × 2.54 = **182.9 cm**

Now we have what we need to plug his numbers into the formulas.

**Using the Mifflin-St Jeor Formula:** BMR = (10 × 86.2) + (6.25 × 182.9) - (5 × 35) + 5 BMR = 862 + 1143.1 - 175 + 5 BMR = **1835 calories per day**

**Using the Harris-Benedict Formula:** BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × 86.2) + (4.799 × 182.9) - (5.677 × 35) BMR = 88.362 + 1154.8 + 877.7 - 198.7 BMR = **1922 calories per day**

See the difference? The Harris-Benedict formula often estimates a little higher, which is totally normal. From my experience and based on current research, the Mifflin-St Jeor result is widely considered the more accurate modern baseline.

# A Real-World BMR Calculation for a Woman

Next up, let’s do the math for Sarah. She's a **45-year-old** woman who is **5'4"" tall (64 inches)** and weighs **150 pounds**.

First, the metric conversions:

* Weight: 150 lbs ÷ 2.20462 = **68 kg**
* Height: 64 inches × 2.54 = **162.6 cm**

Now, let's see what her BMR looks like.

**Using the Mifflin-St Jeor Formula:** BMR = (10 × 68) + (6.25 × 162.6) - (5 × 45) - 161 BMR = 680 + 1016.3 - 225 - 161 BMR = **1310 calories per day**

**Using the Harris-Benedict Formula:** BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 × 68) + (3.098 × 162.6) - (4.330 × 45) BMR = 447.593 + 628.8 + 503.7 - 194.9 BMR = **1385 calories per day**

Once again, there's a small but meaningful difference between the two results. This is precisely why it's so important to pick one formula and stick with it. Consistency is what allows you to accurately track your progress and make adjustments.

>

# BMR Calculation Formulas at a Glance

To make this even easier, here's a quick-reference table with both formulas laid out side-by-side. You can just plug your metric numbers in.

|Formula Type|Formula for Men (Metric)|Formula for Women (Metric)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Mifflin-St Jeor**|BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5|BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161|
|**Harris-Benedict**|BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × weight in kg) + (4.799 × height in cm) - (5.677 × age in years)|BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 × weight in kg) + (3.098 × height in cm) - (4.330 × age in years)|

Having these handy will save you time when you're ready to calculate your own numbers or help someone else with theirs.

Now that you have your BMR, you've found your foundational number—the energy you burn just by being alive. This figure represents your metabolism at complete rest. The next crucial step is to factor in your daily activities to find your true total energy expenditure.

# Factoring In Activity to Find Your TDEE

Okay, so you’ve figured out your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). That number tells you what your body needs just to keep the lights on—if you were lying in bed all day. But let's be real, almost no one does that.

This is where the magic happens. We need to turn that baseline number into something you can actually use in your daily life. That's your **Total Daily Energy Expenditure**, or **TDEE**. Think of it as your *real* daily calorie burn, accounting for everything from your workout to walking the dog and even fidgeting at your desk.

To get there, we simply multiply your BMR by an ""activity multiplier.""

# Choosing Your Activity Multiplier

Now, this part requires a bit of honest self-assessment. It’s incredibly common to think we’re more active than we are, which can throw off the whole calculation. Take a moment to think about your average week—not your *best* week, but your typical one.

Where do you fit in?

Find your activity level in the table below. This will give you the right multiplier to get an accurate estimate of your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).

# Activity Level Multipliers for TDEE Calculation

|Activity Level|Description|Multiplier|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Sedentary**|You have a desk job and get little to no intentional exercise.|**1.2**|
|**Lightly Active**| **1-3** You get light exercise or play sports days a week.|**1.375**|
|**Moderately Active**| **3-5** You engage in moderate exercise or sports days a week.|**1.55**|
|**Very Active**| **6-7** You perform hard exercise or sports days a week, or have a physically active job.|**1.725**|
|**Extra Active**| *and* You have a very physical job do hard exercise most days (e.g., professional athlete).|**1.9**|

Once you’ve found your multiplier, you're ready to see how it connects your baseline BMR to your real-world energy needs.

The image below gives a great visual of how this works—your activity level is the bridge between your resting metabolism and your true daily calorie burn.

As you can see, that activity factor is the key piece of the puzzle, turning a static number into a personalized, dynamic target that reflects your lifestyle.

# Calculating Your TDEE with an Example

Let’s bring back Sarah from the last section. We figured out her BMR was **1,310 calories**.

Sarah works at a desk, but she’s pretty consistent about hitting the gym for spin class or a lifting session about four times a week. That puts her squarely in the **Moderately Active** category.

Here’s how we’d calculate her TDEE:

* TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier
* TDEE = 1,310 × 1.55
* TDEE = **2,030 calories per day**

That **2,030 calorie** number is her ""maintenance"" level. It’s the amount she needs to eat each day to stay at her current weight, given her activity level.

>

The difference your activity makes is huge. For example, a 30-year-old woman who is moderately active might need around **2,000 calories** a day to maintain her weight. But if her lifestyle became sedentary, that number would drop to about **1,750**.

If you'd rather skip the manual math, our simple [**online health calculator**](https://dietfit.appsfy.ai/en/health-calculator) can do the heavy lifting for you.

Now that you have this all-important TDEE value, you’re ready for the next step: tailoring it to achieve your specific goals, whether that’s losing fat, building muscle, or just maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

# How to Adjust Calories for Your Specific Fitness Goals

Okay, so you've calculated your TDEE. That's your ""maintenance"" number—the calories you need to stay exactly where you are. But for most of us, maintenance isn't the final destination. The real magic happens when we learn how to tweak that number to start moving the needle, whether that means losing fat or building muscle.

This all comes down to a simple concept: energy balance. To lose weight, you have to burn more calories than you eat (**a calorie deficit**). To gain weight, you have to eat more than you burn (**a calorie surplus**).

The secret isn't in making drastic, unsustainable changes. Forget those crazy crash diets. A slow, steady, and strategic approach is what delivers results that actually last, all while keeping your metabolism healthy and preserving your hard-earned muscle.

# Aiming for a Calorie Deficit to Lose Fat

If fat loss is what you're after, the goal is to create a consistent, manageable calorie deficit. That just means eating slightly less than your TDEE each day. A great starting point that’s both effective and sustainable is to reduce your daily intake by **300 to 500 calories**.

Let’s go back to our example, Sarah, whose TDEE was **2,030 calories**.

* **Her Goal:** Lose fat at a steady, manageable pace.
* **The Plan:** We'll create a moderate deficit of 400 calories.
* **Her New Daily Target:** 2,030 - 400 = **1,630 calories**.

This small adjustment puts her on track to lose about **0.5 to 1 pound per week**. That might not sound like much, but it’s the sweet spot for losing fat while holding onto muscle, and it's a number she can actually hit without feeling deprived.

# Using a Calorie Surplus to Build Muscle

On the other hand, if you want to build muscle, you have to give your body the extra fuel it needs to repair and grow. This is where a calorie surplus comes in—eating a bit more than your TDEE. The key word here is *slight*. We want to build muscle, not just gain a bunch of fat.

A smart surplus is usually around **300 to 500 calories** above your maintenance number.

Let's look at a new example. Say Mark has a TDEE of **2,844 calories**.

* **His Goal:** Build lean muscle without adding too much fat.
* **The Plan:** We'll add a conservative surplus of 350 calories.
* **His New Daily Target:** 2,844 + 350 = **3,194 calories**.

When Mark pairs this extra fuel with a solid resistance training program, his body has exactly what it needs to build new muscle tissue.

Think of these new calorie targets as your starting point, not a rigid rule. The next step is to pay attention to your body’s feedback and adjust as you go.

# Looking Beyond the Calorie Formulas

[https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGTMUwEDBu4](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGTMUwEDBu4)

While the formulas we've covered are an excellent place to start, it's so important to remember they're just that—a starting point. They give you a solid estimate, but your body is far more complex than a math equation.

Think of your calculated TDEE not as a strict rule, but as your personalized baseline. From here, the real work of fine-tuning begins. Truly understanding your calorie needs means looking beyond the numbers and learning to listen to your body's unique signals.

# The Big Impact of Body Composition

One of the most significant variables a calculator can't see is your **body composition**, which is the ratio of muscle to fat in your body. This is a huge deal because a pound of muscle burns more calories at rest than a pound of fat.

Let's imagine two women who are both 5'5"" and weigh **150 pounds**. One lifts weights regularly and has a good amount of muscle, while the other leads a more sedentary life. Even at the same weight, the weightlifter will naturally have a higher BMR because her muscle tissue is more metabolically active. This is a classic example of why a one-size-fits-all number doesn't always work.

# Factors Your Calculator Misses

Beyond just muscle mass, a handful of other biological processes are quietly influencing your energy use every single day. These are the little nuances that explain why your real-world results might not perfectly match what the calculator predicted.

* **The Thermic Effect of Food (TEF):** Did you know your body burns calories just digesting food? It's true. And protein has the highest thermic effect of all, meaning you use more energy to process a chicken breast than you do for the same calorie amount of carbs or fats.
* **Hormonal Health:** Your hormones are the master regulators of your metabolism. Anything that affects your thyroid function or cortisol levels can significantly speed up or slow down your body's engine.
* **Sleep Quality:** Never underestimate a good night's sleep. Skimping on sleep can throw your appetite and metabolism-regulating hormones out of whack, often making you feel hungrier while simultaneously burning fewer calories.

The estimates in modern nutritional tools are often based on massive amounts of data. Many professional resources, for example, rely on guidelines like the [Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/development-of-dietary-reference-intakes) from the National Academies.

Healthcare pros often use specialized [DRI calculators](https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator) that take user data and provide incredibly detailed nutrient recommendations. These tools are what guide both public health initiatives and individual meal plans. Here’s a peek at what one of those professional-grade calculators looks like.

As you can see, this goes way beyond a simple calorie count. It provides specific targets for macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals, all tailored to your personal data.

# Got Questions About Calorie Math? We've Got Answers

Once you start digging into calorie tracking, a few questions almost always come up. It can feel a little confusing at first, so let's walk through some of the most common sticking points and get you some clear, practical answers.

Think of this as a way to sidestep the usual frustrations and keep your momentum going.

# How Often Should I Re-Run the Numbers?

It’s a great idea to recalculate your daily calorie needs any time you have a significant change in your body or your routine. A solid rule of thumb is to check in again after every **10-15 pounds** of weight change. That’s enough to meaningfully shift your BMR and how many calories you burn each day.

You should also do a quick recalculation if your activity level changes dramatically. Maybe you’ve started a new, intense training program, or perhaps you switched from a job where you were on your feet all day to one behind a desk. For most of us, revisiting the math every 3-4 months is plenty to keep your targets accurate and effective.

# Are Those Online Calorie Calculators Actually Legit?

Online calculators are a fantastic place to start, but no, they aren't going to be 100% perfect for every single person. The good ones use proven formulas like the Mifflin-St Jeor, which is known to be pretty reliable for a wide range of people.

The catch is that they can't see the full picture—your unique genetics, your exact body composition (muscle vs. fat), or how your hormones are behaving.

# Help! Why Am I Not Losing Weight in a Calorie Deficit?

This is easily the most common and frustrating roadblock people hit. It almost always comes down to a few key things. First, take a hard, honest look at your tracking. It's the little things that get you—the splash of oil in the pan, the creamer in your coffee, that handful of nuts you grabbed on the way out the door. These can easily add hundreds of ""ghost"" calories to your day.

Second, be real about your activity level. It’s human nature to overestimate how active we are. If you're certain your tracking is on point, you could just be in a temporary plateau. The body is smart and adapts. Sometimes, a ""refeed day"" where you intentionally eat at your maintenance calories can give your metabolism a helpful nudge.

A few other culprits might be at play, too:

* **Sky-high stress:** Chronic stress pumps up cortisol, a hormone that loves to hang onto body fat.
* **Not enough sleep:** When you're sleep-deprived, the hormones that control hunger and fullness go haywire, usually making you feel much hungrier.
* **Hormonal imbalances:** In some cases, an underactive thyroid or other issues can slow your metabolism down.",1,1755700201.0,diet,1,1.0,False
1mvgdgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryGiftsf/comments/1mvgdgq/the_paradox_of_luxury_gift_cards_indulgence/,"🎁 The Paradox of Luxury Gift Cards: Indulgence, Freedom, or Just Fancy Currency? ✨","Okay so… I have to admit something… gift cards completely confuse me 🤯 but at the same time, they kind of excite me??? Like, isn’t it wild that a little rectangle of plastic or a digital code can feel like both the *laziest* gift in the world and yet somehow the most *thoughtful* depending on how you look at it?? I swear—every time I give or receive one—it feels like a social experiment in miniature.  

Because here’s the thing:  

- They solve the age-old problem of “What if I buy the wrong thing?”  
- They *also* can feel like you barely tried at all.  
- BUT they give freedom, independence, and… strangely… anticipation.  

And then I start spiraling into this near philosophical debate inside my brain: Does a gift stop being a “gift” if it’s technically just currency tied to a specific brand? Like you don’t hand someone cash and say, “Surprise!” in the same exact way. But you hand them a black, sleek card with “Louis Vuitton” or “Hermès” stamped across it and suddenly the whole room gasps? Same value. Different vibe.  

https://goodnovel.org/  

When I try to sort it out, I end up with these questions eating away at me:  

- Is the meaning of a gift card tied more to the label and experience of *where* it can be used than the act of giving itself?  
- Do gift cards lose their emotional depth compared to something hand-picked, or do they gain a new symbolic depth from the possibility it represents?  
- Why does a high-end designer gift card feel like a *treasure map*, while a generic coffee shop one just feels like… “eh, thank you, I guess”?  

I keep staring at this paradox. Because the truth is: gift cards sit on a strange border where luxury intersects with practicality. They’re simultaneously indulgent and transactional. Someone could give you a mysterious designer bracelet from Cartier—or a Cartier gift card. Both signal taste, but each plays with your imagination differently. One’s definitive; the other’s open-ended curiosity.  

https://goodnovel.org/  

And I feel like this REALLY matters in our world of luxury gifting. When we’re always asking what makes a gift *memorable*, the humble (yet loaded) gift card might hold answers we don’t admit out loud. It’s flexible, unpredictable, reflecting not the giver’s taste but the recipient’s instincts. There’s kind of a freedom in that.  

So here’s where I’m stuck—are we undervaluing gift cards as uninspired, or are we failing to see how they tap into the “luxury of choice?” Maybe a gift card *isn’t* the absence of personalization after all. Maybe it’s the whisper of possibility.  

Would love to hear your experiences—especially when the gift card was for something extravagant. Did it feel more personal or less? Did it spark a sense of liberation… or disappointment?  

https://goodnovel.org/  

Because maybe the real luxury gift isn’t the item waiting on the shelf—it’s the choice itself.",1,1755700147.0,LuxuryGiftsf,0,1.0,False

Newport will always be a popular destination no changing that. But can we please at least try to keep non retail spots to ourselves! Let people discover it on their own means. I get its on the map on google etc or on a website. 

I know that its 2025 and most things are already on the internet but we can still reduce the spread of secret spots or local gems. Theres a few spots Ive been going to for years and as tourism has increased its had a negative impact on them. One swimming spot on the cliff walk used to be less popular and relaxing. Now you have wedding parties going to 40 steps doing full on photo shoots with no consideration to anyone else in the area. Like full on video productions on the stairway for 30 minutes and then they get mad when you try to pass by even though you've already been waiting for them to pause. Another heavenly spot which I would love to spend eternity hanging out at has become well known. It was a mostly private area, not many people knew about it. In the recent years its blown up. Someone posted a detailed guide on how to get there on tiktok, you have families coming (nothing wrong with family gatherings I mean) from out of state and leaving garbage behind. 

Theres not many places left in Newport/Middletown to get away from the hustle and bustle. Not everyone appreciates what we have and wants to take care of it. I often clean up garbage from tourists ranging from stuff like balloons, coffee cups to even a whole pack of shotgunned beers surrounded by cigs and bags of chips. It would be nice if we pretended certain outdoor spots never existed publicly. It doesn't happen often online but I just wanted to put it out there. I'm also not saying boycott local biz. Go support locally owned shops and places like the amazing wildlife sanctuaries on the island.

Designed for the Brondell Circle Under Sink Water Filtration System, this replacement set combines carbon block and sediment filtration along with reverse osmosis membrane technology. As someone who values clean and great-tasting water (because let’s face it, tap water doesn't always cut it), I had high hopes for this product. 

**Design and Build Quality**

The carbon-based block filtration stood out to me immediately because of how compact yet efficient it feels. Measuring 2.75""D x 8.25""W x 11.25""H and weighing 2.6 pounds, it’s not an eyesore and tucks neatly under the sink. I was impressed by how durable it feels when you hold it; you know it’s built to last for its six-month lifespan. Installing this filter with its twist-and-seal mechanism was a breeze and required no special tools—just a quick click here and a twist there.

**Performance: Does It Really Work?**

Testing its filtration claims, I could taste a remarkable difference almost instantly. It’s designed to reduce VOCs, chlorine, and other contaminants while eliminating rust, sand, and particulates, which is crucial for city dwellers where water can sometimes taste questionable. In my kitchen, I noticed clearer water and even better-smelling coffee in the mornings—something my partner also commented on. The three-stage filtration system, combining pre-and post-carbon layers and a sediment filter, really does its job. However, remember to replace this filter regularly every six months, or the quality diminishes.

**Advantages**

- Reliable filtration system (3-stage carbon combined with reverse osmosis).
- Easy to install with no professional help needed.
- Noticeable improvement in water clarity and taste.
- Compact design that fits well under the sink.
- Features a battery-powered filter change indicator.

[Check Brondell RF-20 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b012ut5v66/)

**Sustainability and Eco-Friendly Approach**

This brand seems proud of its sustainability initiative, and their design reflects that. It’s refreshing to use a product that doesn’t just focus on functionality but also on reducing environmental impact. Knowing that this filter and the filtration system as a whole are geared toward minimizing waste and water usage makes a difference for eco-conscious users like myself. 

**Negatives to Keep in Mind**

While the Brondell RF-20 filter does an admirable job overall, it’s not without its challenges:

- The upfront cost might deter those on a budget.
- Regular six-month replacements can feel like a hassle.
- Only compatible with the Brondell Circle system, limiting its usability for other setups.

**Competitive Options**

When comparing this to other replacement filtration options like Aquasana or APEC’s under-sink alternatives, Brondell excels in user-friendliness and installation simplicity. Aquasana might offer similar filtration capabilities but requires more effort in setup. APEC systems often have slightly bulkier filters, which could pose fitting challenges in smaller kitchen setups. However, if you’re looking for a sustainable, easy-to-use, and specific filter for the Brondell Circle system, this one stands out.

**Price Performance**

Taking into account its performance and user-friendly design, the Brondell RF-20 water filter delivers good bang for the buck. It’s not the cheapest filter out there, but the taste improvement and visible water clarity justify the expenditure. The fact that you can trust it with crucial filtration tasks like removing industrial chemicals and chlorine adds value. Plus, the filter includes a replacement battery for the indicator, which feels like a thoughtful inclusion.

But here’s something you can try **without caffeine** and without leaving your desk (thought you should still get up from your seat and move around for God's sake!).

**The 3-Minute Desk Reset:**

1. **Posture Check (30 sec):** Sit tall, roll shoulders back, open your chest.
2. **Breath Reset (1 min):** Inhale deeply through the nose for 4 counts, exhale slowly for 6 counts.
3. **Eye Break (1 min):** Look away from your screen — focus on something at least 20 feet away.
4. **Mini Stretch (30 sec):** Neck rolls, wrist circles, or quick hamstring stretch.

It sounds too simple… until you try it.  
  
This small reset can refresh your mind, reduce physical tension, and help you finish the day strong — no extra coffee needed.",1,1755699723.0,HealthWala,0,1.0,False

We all know how hard it gets to actually meet new people once you’re out of college or stuck in 9–5 life. That’s why I made r/NashikHangouts – a chill community for anyone in/around Nashik who wants to:

1) Plan weekend Misals 😋
2) Go for food hunts 🍕
3) Coffee/beer catchups ☕🍻
4) Game nights / movie marathons 🎮🎬
5) Or just vibe with new folks ✨


No creepy DMs, no weirdness 🚫 — just a safe space to connect, plan group activities, and make Nashik a little more fun.

We’re Sergio, Dario and Davide, three friends from Italy on a crazy hitchhiking trip: we started in Baku and we’re making our way back home to Milan only by thumb.
So far we’ve crossed Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, Greece, North Macedonia and right now we’re in Kosovo.

👉 Tomorrow (21st → 22nd August) we want to reach northern Albania — and we’re open to any place we can reach from Pristina (Shkodër, Shëngjin, Theth, Velipojë… we’re flexible!).

A bit about us:

Sergio – medical student 🩺

Dario – neuroscience student 🧠

Davide – postman 📬 (and the one who keeps us grounded in reality 😉).


We know we’re three people, which can feel like a crowd, but we travel light: we have sleeping mats and sleeping bags, so even a floor works fine for us. We’re all ex-scouts, so we adapt easily.

More than anything, what excites us is meeting locals, sharing stories, learning about Albanian culture, and of course having a good laugh together.
If anyone has space to host us (or even just share a tea/coffee and some company), we’d be super grateful 🙏.

Thanks so much for reading — and maybe see you soon somewhere in the north of Albania!

Warm regards,
Sergio, Dario & Davide

### Parsing the Odds: When Math Meets Mayhem

The numbers scream “Sounders party!” louder than a Seattle rainstorm screams “sunshine.” Let’s crunch the cold, hard cash of bookmaker logic:

* **Seattle Sounders**: Decimal odds of **1.36–1.48** (implied probability: **68–73.5%**) across major books. They’re the financial equivalent of a 1030 AM infomercial: *“THIS IS THE MOST CERTAIN THING YOU’VE EVER SEEN!”*
* **Puebla**: Decimal odds of **5.8–7.05** (implied probability: **14–17%**). That’s the statistical equivalent of betting your last dollar that a squirrel will solve quantum physics during a power outage.
* **Draw**: Odds of **4.8–5.0** (20–21% implied). A “draw” here feels like a bet that your Uncle Bob will *finally* remember your name at a family reunion.

The Sounders’ dominance in the numbers is as obvious as a “For Rent” sign at a homeless shelter. But let’s not let the math dull the drama.

### Team News: Injuries, Coach Changes, and the Weight of Expectation

**Seattle Sounders**: On a **10-game winning streak**, they’ve been the NBA’s Luka Dončić of MLS—unstoppable, slightly sleep-deprived, and wondering why everyone’s so surprised. But their recent **1-0 loss to Minnesota United** (a team that once lost to a college side) is the sports equivalent of a “glitch in the matrix.” Key players like **Jordan Morris** and **Cristian Roldan** are as healthy as a vegan at a salad bar, so their attack should hum like a Tesla on Autopilot.

**Puebla**: This Liga MX also-ran is playing with the emotional grit of a team that just found out their coach quit. **Pablo Guede’s resignation** after four losses in five games left them scrambling to promote **Martín Bravo** from “coffee-fetcher” to interim boss. Bravo’s first press conference? A masterclass in panic: “We’ll play with heart… and maybe Google Maps, since I’m not familiar with the stadium.” Yet, Puebla’s \*\*upset wins
