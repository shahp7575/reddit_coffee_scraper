I finally got the courage to give her my number and ask to maybe grab coffee or something. As soon as she left she texted me to basically give me hers. Basically giving her a way out in case I caught her off guard and she was just being nice as this was the first time we had ever actually interacted. Later that day I sent just a follow up text like hopefully I didn’t bother you in the gym and she sent back hours later all good etc. I texted back that night and she hasn’t responded (it’s been 15 hours or so). Mainly wanted to get to know her a bit and try to ask her to hang out and get to know each other better. But from my past experience long replies/ no replies is there way of telling you they’re not interested. Trying to not get my hopes up if nothing is gonna happen.

I’m a mix of soft & strong: I lift heavy at the gym (leg day twice a week 🤭), cycle for fun, run 5km every Sunday, and chase sunsets when I need peace. Nature trips are my therapy. And yes, I love raving, techno, and EDM I’m either recharging in nature or losing myself on the dancefloor.

I’ve been in the BPO industry for 7 years, currently WFH 10PM–7AM, weekends off. I’d love to meet someone in the same field or also on the night shift. Para tugma schedule natin, and maybe someday it could lead to living together if things go well.

I value emotional maturity, effort, and intentional people. I’ve healed a lot from my past, and I protect my peace. I’m not here to play games. I want something real and steady.

For transparency: I’ve only had two serious relationships. One lasted 5 years and 5 months, and the second 4 months. And I’m post-op trans, 3 years now.

What I’m looking for:  
• someone kind & respectful  
• can hold a real conversation  
• loves adventures/nature trips  
• values growth & effort  
• bonus points if you’re active or into fitness  
• bonus if you’re in BPO or night shift  
• ultra bonus if you’re into EDM/techno  
• 420-friendly is a plus

We can date wholesome, take things slow, and just see where it goes. No pressure, just good energy.

If you vibe with that, maybe we can grab coffee, go for a walk, plan a nature escape, or rave together someday.

1pbn672,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1pbn672/how_was_i_supposed_to_handle_this_social_situation/,How was I supposed to handle this social situation?,"Basically, I am going to go back in time to 2 yrs ago. When I first started med school. I was in a class of 35 students so relatively small class. However, I didnt fit in. It became apparently by the first week. 

I tried to be social such as introducing myself to others and sitting next to others in the cafe. I noticed that my friendless was met with neutral energy. By the end of the first week, everyone had figure out the people they wanted to be friends with. I knew that something was off when I went to the first bar event. Everyone had car pooled except me and people had formed social circles. I will admit that I am not the best conversalists but I wasnt given a fair opportunity. Most people would stop talking to me within one minute if I was not engaging enough. 

I tried to not take it personally, but I was iced out at the next social event. No one expecting me to come. At this point trying to talk to women in the class was pointless. It was clear I was unpopular and most of the women didnt even try to hold a convo except my future female friend. She ironically was the prettiest girl and she took me under her wing. She friended me first on instagram. She even told me that you dont have to sit alone. 

Till this day, Idk if she ever liked me. I say this because in the beginning she was extremely touchy and teased me alot. She clam down once she got a bf. But it was crazy becuase I asked her to let me take her to the bar. She agreed and even brought me a cookie as thanks. At the bar, she made it clear that I took her and I was taking her home. I screwed up back then being shy so she went home with another dude lol. That is why I say she might had a small crush. We only stayed friends because she actively text me even presently. But back to the story. 

I had it tough. I even tried to become more social by talking more. People just made fun of me. Alot of the guys would hang with my female friend and block opportunities for me to connect. Like inviting her to their house and a couple others. I tried therapy, social skill training, and life coaching. At first I was gaslit into thinking I was the problem. However, at they heard me complain about how people typically never talk to me first unless I walk up to them. They told me to just move on. My last ditch effort was to get drunk with them since I am actually the life of the party. They recording me drinking and claim I was an alcoholic. And that I love driving home drunk. 

There was no people on the outside unfortunately. All I had was coffee shops and hobbies. Eventually I isolated myself and moved on. Now 2 years today, I dont even talk to any of them except my female friend. I have a soft side for her since she was supportive back then. 

But was there a better way to handle this? It significantly added to the reason why I think everyone is fake and I dont like to socialize as much anymore. ",1,1764619352.0,AskMenAdvice,3,0.67,False

Growing more and more nervous, I swiveled on my stool and looked towards the front of Flanagan’s pub to find everyone there staring at me as well, all with the same dull expression.  The butt slapper, the crooning man, the party hat people—all of them were dead silent and focused on me and me alone.  I gulped and turned to John, whose grey eyes held the same intensity as those of his patrons, though unlike them, he was smiling.  This smile was not comforting in the slightest, especially after I noticed the drool; with his mouth slightly ajar, a puddle of spit had formed just between his bottom teeth and his lower lip, a puddle that was now steadily overflowing and dripping onto his pants, his stool, and the oak floor.  This hypnotic drip-drop was, I noticed, the only sound in the place.  Every instinct was telling me to run, to get out of the pub and not stop sprinting until I was in safer, more familiar company.  My brain wanted this, but my body was not obliging, paralyzed with the exception of my pounding heart.  I was startled when John broke the oppressive silence with a question:

“Yer father—where is he now?”

“What exactly is going on he—”

Before I could finish, John grabbed me by the throat, his hands coarse and strong, his nails carving into my neck.  I felt warm blood start to trickle around the indentations of his meaty fingers as he squeezed tighter.  Air—which had been taken for granted up to this point—was growing scarce, not helped by the fact that I had been mid-exhalation when John had started to strangle me.  I tried reaching my own hands up to pull his off, but his grip only tightened the more I struggled.  Lightheadedness starting to take hold of me, I reached for my empty beer glass, picked it up, and brought it down in a swift arc on top of John’s slicked-back hair. 

He didn’t even blink as the remnants of the glass scattered onto his shoulder and the surrounding floor. 

“I’m going to ask you one more time before you lose consciousness,” John said, his tone more matter of fact than outright threatening.  He almost seemed bored, plucking a piece of glass out of his cheek with his free hand.  “And if you don’t answer my question, then I will allow you to pass out.  As soon as you wake up, we will play this game again.  And again.  And again.  Until I get my answer.  Understand?”

I nodded as best as I could against his hand, gasping for breath like a fish out of water. 

“Good,” he said, releasing his grip.  I heaved in as much glorious oxygen as I could before making a break for the front door.  To my surprise, everyone was allowing me to pass, some even getting out of my way and laughing at me.  John joined in on this laughter and yelled from his seat:

“I wouldn’t do that, lad!”

Ignoring him, I barreled towards the front door, the bald karaoke man blowing me a kiss and snorting as I grabbed the handle and swung the door open.  If I hadn’t been holding the door handle, I would have fallen straight down into what now lay before me:

Nothing.

With one foot extended out into the darkness and the other still on tiptoes at the edge of the entryway, I felt my stomach do backflips as my eyes searched for anything that looked like New York.  There were no buildings, no people, no buses—there wasn’t even a street.  Just a void that threatened to suck me in and never let me go.  Pivoting on the only foot touching solid ground and pulling the rest of my weight back inside using the door handle, I collapsed backwards into the pub, thankful for the fluorescent ceiling lights now burning my clammy cheeks.  Clapping hands erupted behind me. 

“Bravo, Mr. Elliot Collins,” John shouted.  “A valiant effort, to be sure.  Your reflexes are quite intact—other people have not been so lucky.”  He pushed himself up from his stool and walked over to me, upside down from my point of view on the floor, his boots landing with emphasis on the creaking oak, each step sounding to me like the sharp reverberation of a downward guillotine.  Once the boots reached my face, I winced as he grabbed me by the shoulders and pulled me up to my feet.  He spun me around, his smile no longer warm and friendly, but taunting. 

“And where did you think you might be gettin’ off to?” he asked, dusting me off and straightening my collared shirt.  “We’ve still got places to go and sights ta see, you and me.”  He thrusted his arm around the back of my neck like we were old pals and walked me back to the bar, all the bar patrons still watching with mirth.  “Now, I believe I was in the middle of asking you a question.”  His talon-like fingers once again sunk their way just underneath my clavicle, and he squeezed to the point I cried out in pain. 

“For yer reference, this is a one,” he said, then tightened his grip further, making me howl until he loosened his hold.  “That was a four.  We can go all the way to ten if ye like, but I figure you’d rather just answer my question this time.”

I nodded my head with enthusiasm, which made him laugh again.

“Good.  So, yer father—where is he spending New Year’s Eve?”

For a moment, I was terrified that I wouldn’t be able to answer his question, my brain too preoccupied with its ongoing fight or flight mode to process that kind of historical information.  As his grip escalated to what I assumed was at least a three, the answer miraculously broke through the pain:

“The *Gazette*!” I cried, and he loosened his grip once more. 

“You’re sure?” he asked.  “You wouldn’t be lyin’ to me now, would ya lad?”

“No, no, no,” I said, shaking my head as vigorously as I could in the negative.  “He always spends New Year’s Eve working overtime.  He wants the first paper of the year to be perfect.”

“Is he alone?” John asked, and I noticed that drool was starting to drip down from his bottom lip again.

“I-I think so.  He usually sends the rest of his employees home around five.  He’s really OCD about certain things and he says he likes to work without distraction.  He’s been there finishing up at five in the morning for certain editions he thinks are important.”

“Very good,” John said, satisfied enough to loosen his grip a bit.  He started pushing me towards what looked to be a broom closet at the back right corner of the pub. 

“W-where are you taking me?” I asked, feeling sick to my stomach.

“Narnia,” John said, cackling.  Unable to stop myself, I threw up on one of the wooden tables we were passing, the brown, black, and yellow sludge reminding me of my dislike of Guinness.  The people sitting at said table—an elderly couple—weren’t upset or disgusted in the slightest, joining John in his cruel laughter as he continued to push me along towards the back door.  My lip quivered against the fresh vomit droplets and I began to cry.

“Please,” I begged.  “Please, please just let me go.  I can pay you.  My dad has money.  Whatever you want, just name it.  Just let me go.”

We reached the door and John turned to me as he put his hand on the brass knob.  “Well, I suppose we could ask yer paw if those terms are acceptable to ’im.”  He turned the knob clockwise and pushed the door inward. 

At first, I didn’t really believe what I was seeing, thinking my mind was playing tricks on me.  As we stepped through the door and into the room, I looked around and persisted on the notion that what I was seeing was impossible.  The white walls, the generic motivational posters with sunsets and mountaintops, the smell of burnt coffee—I’d been in this room many times, mostly as a kid.  This wasn’t right, this didn’t make sense, and though I knew that the *New York Gazette’s* office was miles away from Flanagan’s Pub, the familiar figure hunched over the large, metal offset printing press told me that I had defied all known laws of physics to arrive in my dad’s place of business.  As that familiar figure looked up from his work, his greying brows furrowed and his five o’ clock shadow stretched by a confused frown, he asked:

“Son?  What are you doing here?  And who’s this with you?”

I tried to speak, to tell my dad to run and get help, but the words wouldn’t come.  John—who still had his arm wrapped around my shoulders—spoke for me.

“I’m an old friend,” John said, smiling and pointing to his own grey hair.  “Emphasis on the word ‘old.’  John Flanagan.  Pleasure to meet ya.  And, to answer your first question, young Elliot here was sharin’ the details of yer newspaper operation, and I was curious and wanted to see it for meself.” 

“Well, uh…” my dad started, clearly taken aback by the current proceedings.  “I guess any friend of Elliot is a friend of mine.  I’m just putting some finishing touches on tomorrow’s edition.  Were you interested in journalism?”  My dad looked me up and down, his eyes questioning my apparent discomfort with the situation. 

“Oh, you could say that,” John said with a smirk.  “I love to hear people’s stories.  I find them very…illuminatin’, you could say.” 

“Uh-huh,” my dad said, still looking at me.  “Elliot, are you okay?”

Try as I might, I could not get my vocal cords to produce sound. 

“He’s fine,” John answered for me, slapping me on the back and walking over to my dad and gesturing to the printing press.  “Beautiful piece of equipment ya have here.  How does it—”

“S-stop,” I said, my voice weak yet loud enough for my father to hear. 

“Don’t come any closer,” my dad said, putting up a hand to the stranger, who obliged and held his own hands up in faux humility. 

“My apologies, Mr. Collins, my apologies,” John said.  “Me curiosity got the better of me, that’s all.”

“Just what in the hell are you doing here?” my dad asked, wary of the man—the thing—in front of him.

“I’m a friend of yer boy’s, like I said.”

“No he isn’t,” I said, finally finding my voice again.  “Dad, get out of here.”

My dad looked from me to John and back again. 

“What’s going on, son?”

“There’s something wrong with him,” I blubbered.  “H-he’s not…he’s…”

“A bit of a rascal,” John said, winking at me.  “I agree.  But, rascal or no, I do have some business with Mr. Barnabas Collins, here.”  He nodded towards my father. 

“Barnie is fine,” my dad said, still holding his hand up.  “And you can stay right there, mister…”

“Flanagan,” John said with a bow.  “John Flanagan of Flanagan’s Pub.”

“Never heard of it,” my dad said, crossing his arms.

“We’re sort of tucked away,” John said, standing up straight again.  “Very selective with our clientele.  We don’t want just any riffraff coming in and causing trouble.  Your son was kind enough to grace the establishment with his presence.  Really classed up the joint, if I do say so meself.”

My dad looked back at me again.  “Is this true, son?  Or is this just more malarkey coming out of his mouth?”

“I-I did go to his bar,” I said.  “But I dunno—it’s hard to explain.  He might hurt you.  C-call the police.”

“Hurt me?”  My dad looked John up and down, gulping and backing up a step, like a man who’d just realized there was a lion in the den with him.  Shaking his head, he regained his composure and glared at John, a facial expression I knew all too well as his ‘stern look,’ the look that made everyone—except for my mother, who usually giggled at his attempt to come across as a tough guy—shrink into themselves in preparation for some sort of lecture about everything they had done wrong or even thought about doing wrong.  “Did you hurt my son?  What in the hell are you doing here?”

“I told you,” John said, trying—and failing—to hold back laughter.  “I’m a friend of yer boy’s.” 

“That’s it,” my dad said, pulling his cell phone out of his ridiculous belt clip that no amount of teasing from any of his family members had gotten him to stop using.  “I’m calling the police.  They can sort this shit out.”

I saw the phone clutter to the ground before I was even able to perceive that John had moved.  Now positioned in front of my father, John’s hand was clamped around my dad’s now empty one. 

“What the fuck?” My dad said, trying to jerk his hand out of the stranger’s grip to no avail.  “Let go of me!”  He tried shoving, punching, and kicking from every possible angle he could muster, but John did not seem to even register the body hits, unmoving.

“Nah,” John said.  “I don’t think I will.  Not until your son does something for me.”

“What do you want?” I said, finding the courage—or the stupidity—to step forward, closing the gap a hair.  “I’ll do anything you want if you’ll just leave us alone.  Please.”

“I’m afraid you’re in too deep, me boy,” John said as he beckoned me forward with a curled index finger.  “But you can make this as painful as you care to make it.  Come ’ere, lad.  I’ve got a job for you.”

“What do you want me to do?” I asked.  This was apparently not what John wanted to hear, as he suddenly twisted my dad’s arm inward, extending it out and making my dad shriek in the process.  It was a sound I had never heard my father make before, and it’s one that still echoes throughout my dreams. 

“STOP IT, STOP IT!” I yelled, and John loosened his grip somewhat, much to my dad’s obvious relief. 

“I didn’t tell you to ask questions,” John said.  “I asked you to come over.”

“DON’T LISTEN TO THIS MANIAC, SON!” my dad bellowed.  “RUN AND CALL THE POLICE!”

Not an outburst that John had wanted to hear, he then punched my father—hard—in the stomach, making my dad double over onto his knees, panting, his hand still held above him by John. 

“You boys really are thick, ain’t ye?” John said, with no small amount of venom in his frenzied eyes.  “No one is calling the police.  No one is leavin’ until I say they’re leavin’.  You’re both to do as I say, or you’re liable to get hurt.  Now—*come here*, Mr. Elliot Collins.”

I did as he asked, though not without reluctance.  With each step forward, the dread in my heart built itself up more and more.  By the time I reached our collective captor, my father had stood himself back up, sweat now marking his forehead.  He looked at me with what I can only describe as sympathy, a look that said this situation was somehow his fault and he was sorry about it.  Seeing him like this, my nausea rose along with my sense of guilt. 

“Excellent,” John said, smiling.  “So, ye *can* follow simple directions.  Let’s move on to step two.”  He nodded towards the printing press next to him.  “Open it.”

The “it” in question was the cage perched atop the moving gripper bars in the machine, which were steadily whirring along their track of aligning and shoving paper further into the press for printing.  My father—ever the taskmaster—usually liked to get the gripper bars moving at their highest speeds once he was satisfied with the newspaper and finally ready to print, ensuring he got his “money’s worth” out of what he jokingly called his “work horse.”  Knowing full well that said “work horse” had a maximum speed of processing seventeen-thousand sheets of paper per hour, I started to picture where John’s request was going as I watched the bars underneath the cage cyclically grab and shove sheets of paper at their now unsettling velocity. 

“Did I stutter?” John asked, twisting my father’s arm and causing him to yelp like a wounded dog. 

“Okay!  Okay!” I acquiesced, grabbing the metal cage and lifting it up on its hinge.  The gripper bars suddenly stopped moving, one having just picked up a new piece of paper.

“Good,” John said.  “Now, do me another kindness and take yer paw’s hand.”  He sidestepped behind my father to grab his free arm, then extended the arm closest to the printing press towards me. 

“Just do what he says, son,” my dad said, weirdly calm about everything. 

“D-dad, I—”

“Trust me son,” my dad said.  “If you don’t do this, he’s just gonna do something even worse.  Go ahead.”

With tears welling up and starting to stream down my cheeks, I did as my old man said and took the offered arm.  John let go of it, tightening his grip on the other arm and massaging my dad’s shoulders with his free hand. 

“Good boy,” John said, his voice shaky with what I assumed was anticipation.  “Now, I think ye know where I’m goin’ with this, yeah?”

“Yeah,” I said with a gulp, my throat suddenly very dry. 

John nodded towards the opened press.  “Go on then, lad.” 

I gave my dad one last pleading look, hoping had some way out of this horrible situation.  Still calm, he gave me a gentle nod, as if I was doing nothing more than putting a batch of cookies in the oven with him supervising.  Seeing no other option, I did what John wanted and gingerly guided my father’s arm down into the machine between the still bars. 

“Turn it on,” John said. 

“Do I have to—”

“Son,” my dad interrupted, “do as the man says.  I promise it’ll be okay.”

Just like that, with those reassuring words, all the baseball games my dad took me to, all the secret fast food nights when my mom was out of town, all the times he played my dumb PlayStation games with me just to make me happy after he had spent a long day at work—all of these imprinted memories crawled out from their respective corners of my brain and made themselves known again.  I gave one last pleading look to John, who shrugged and said:

“You wanted this.”

“No, I didn’t.”

John simply nodded towards the power button on the side of the press in response, apparently deeming further arguments with me a waste of his time.  I crouched down next to the red button, my finger hovering just in front of it as I glanced up at my dad, feeling tears welling up in my eyes.  To my surprise, he did not seem the least bit frightened.

“Do it,” my dad said.

Wincing, I pressed the power button, turning away from it all as I waited for the gripper bars to dig into his skin.  I waited like that for about ten seconds, listening for the sound of the cycling machinery, but it never came.  Turning back with no small amount of reluctance, I saw that my father’s arm was unharmed, the gripper bars still in their same position underneath the open cage.  My dad gave me a knowing wink before craning his neck back to address the sociopath behind him, whose downturned brow gave away a sense of befuddlement. 

“Feature of the press,” my dad explained.  “A safety mechanism locks the bars as soon as the cage is lifted up.  Now, listen—Mr. Flanagan, was it?  Whatever kind of trouble my son is in, I’m sure we can work something out.  If it’s drug money you’re after, it wouldn’t be the first time I had to dig Elliot out of a financial hole.  I have cash on me, and I can certainly go to an ATM with you if that doesn’t cover it.  There’s no need for police, there’s no need for any more violence.  Let’s work together, here.”

“You’ll really take me to an ATM?” John asked.

“Yes,” my dad said, his voice going up an octave in his eagerness.  “Yes, absolutely.  I’ll take you to an ATM right now.”

“Hm,” John said, drumming his fingers on my dad’s shoulders.  “A fine offer, Mr. Collins, but I believe our path has already been set by yer boy, here.” 

Without warning, John punched the side of the printing press and—against the established safety precautions—it whirred to life again.  I screamed out just before my dad did as the gripper bars moved on their track at a high speed—one on top driving into his upper forearm, one on the bottom forcing his wrist in the opposite direction, his arm gaining an unnatural zigzag shape as the sharp points of the bars cut into his skin and drew fresh blood. 

“PLEASE!” my dad howled in a pitch I’d never heard before.  “S-STOP!”

“STOP IT!” I screamed, grabbing John by the collar of his shirt.  He seemed unbothered. 

“I suppose I could,” John said, observing the blood pooling into the bottom of the machine with all the interest of a man watching paint dry.  “But I don’t think I will, Mr. Elliot Collins.  I don’t think I will.” 

Just when my dad started to falter in his posture, slumping down somewhat against the press, John gave the machine another smack and somehow got the gripper bars pushing even harder, jolting my dad back into an upright stance with a fresh shriek of pain. 

“Do you want it to stop?” John asked.

“Y-YES!” my dad screamed, which got him a hearty slap on the back of the head from John.

“Not you,” he growled before turning to me.  “Do you want it to stop?”

“YES!” I shouted.  “FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STOP IT!”

“Then give the machine one more hit, if you please.”  John backed away from his spot and pointed towards my target. 

“T-that’s just been making it faster,” I said.

“Uh-huh,” John said.  “That’s the idea.”

“P-please son,” my dad said, his face now pale, straining with the effort it took to speak.  “I-I can’t take much more of this.  Just make it quick.”

Seeing no other choice, I walked up to the press and punched it as hard as I could, wanting to punish myself for everything that was happening.  As my hand landed with a resounding *thud* and the bones within it creaked and cracked, the gripper bar teeth—which should not have had anywhere near the strength or sharpness to do this—bit through my father’s forearm and tore it from the rest of his body, leaving it lying in a heap at the bottom of the cage as the bars finally slowed to a halt, my dad screeching as blood from his remaining upper arm covered his lost limb in a sickeningly pulsatile fashion before he fell backwards onto the ground.  I crouched down next to him, tears streaming down my face as he panted like a wounded dog. 

“Dad,” I said, my voice cracking.  “I…I’m so sorry.  I’m so sorry.  I didn’t mean for this to—”    

“I know you didn’t,” my dad wheezed.  “It’s okay.  I know you didn’t.  You’re a good…”

His voice trailed off as his eyes did, away from me and towards some unseen place.  I grabbed his remaining hand with my own broken one, too distraught to acknowledge my own throbbing pangs of resistance to the act.

“I’m so sorry,” I blubbered, my tears now falling down on his still cheeks.  “I’m so so sorry.  Please don’t go.  Please.  I’ll be a better son, just please don’t leave me.”

A slow clapping emanated from behind me.  Snot dripping down onto my lips, I turned back to face their source. 

“Very good, Mr. Elliot Collins,” John said, still clapping.  “A bravura performance if ever there was one.  And the tears at the end?  Oscar worthy.”

“You son of a bitch,” I said, my grief giving way to fury.  “This isn’t a performance.  You took my dad away from me, you sick fuck.” 

“Technically you landed the killing blow, me boy,” John said, straightening his black suit, the smiley face on his tee shirt now dabbed with my father’s blood.  “Yer dad wanted a legacy?  By God, he’s got one now, all thanks to you.  Wait ’til the coppers see this.  There’s a headline fer tomorrow’s paper.”

As if on cue, the press spat out a fresh edition of what should have been tomorrow’s *Gazette*.  The all-caps title piece—“HAPPY NEW YEAR!”—was just legible through the red stains. 

“YOU SICK FUCK!” I screamed, no longer caring about the possible reprimands as I jumped up from my father’s still body and began wailing on John with my fists.  While I felt every ounce of pain as I continued to shatter the bones in my already-broken hand, I saw through my tears—of pain, of grief, of everything—that the punches were having no effect on John whatsoever, regardless of where they landed.  He didn’t try to stop me, he didn’t say anything, he didn’t make a move—he just stood there and took it, his face expressionless as he patiently waited for me to realize that my efforts were futile.  I don’t know how long I stood there trying to hit him from every single angle I could think of both above and below the belt, sweating and screaming all the while.  Eventually, I exhausted myself, and I let my hands—one swollen and red—slide down the smiley face on John’s chest and fall down to their normal resting positions. 

“Are ye finished, lad?” John said.  I still think to this day that there was some miniscule spark of empathy in his eyes and voice at this moment. 

“Yes,” I panted, defeated.  “I guess you’ll kill me next?”

“No,” John said, his smile returning, as if snapped out of sleep.  “We have something else in mind for ye.”

As he led me back through the open, impossible door into Flanagan’s Pub, the party inside was back in the full swing it had been when I first walked in that evening.  The balding, thin man was back to crooning Roy Orbison at full blast, the patrons were all clinking their glasses to the ongoing ball drop that was being broadcast on the various televisions, and Miss Patty was serving drinks like they were going out of style.  John guided me back to the barstool I had previously been sitting in—the one that I came to realize had always been meant for me—and that’s where I’ve been sitting for the majority of the years that have since passed following that fateful night.  I say years, and I could very easily be mistaken—time is a bit tricky in Flanagan’s Pub.  Hell, I might have been in here for decades, centuries even.  I don’t age and I don’t drink anymore, but even so, there are things from my life that I am starting to forget.  I no longer remember what my mother looks like.  I don’t remember why I chose to ruin a friendship over a girl, but I do remember my friend’s contorted, tear-ridden, furious face after I told him what I’d done.  Even the memories of my father—the good ones, the ones from my childhood before I grew up into the disappointment I turned out to be—are starting to slip away, while the memory of him screaming, his arm being ripped from his body, and his final moments of words unsaid still remain. 

None of us really talk to each other here.  It’s deathly quiet most of the time, but every now and then someone new will walk through that front door and we will suddenly be partying like there’s no tomorrow, like we’d been partying long before they arrived.  I suppose, in a way, we have been.  It’s hard to explain, but it’s like a play that constantly changes and that you never have to rehearse for.  Sometimes, we have a football fan coming in and everything in the pub—us patrons included—are suddenly decked out in the appropriate team’s regalia.  Maybe someone just came from a funeral, and in those cases, the pub takes on a more somber, dimly lit interior.  Sometimes it’s John talking to these folks like he talked to me, but sometimes it’s another one of the patrons.  I suspect that, one day, it’ll be me talking to some poor, lost soul that wanders in here.  No matter who talks to them, it always ends the same—they always end up going through the backdoor, witnessing something awful, and then coming back in here, changed, shaken, and resigned to take their seat at the table.  The first few times that someone walked in, I tried to warn them, to tell them to run away, but something kept me from finding the words.  I hate to admit it, but now, I laugh along with everyone else, pretending to have a great time—or a bad time, if that’s what the new guest needs to see.  Maybe I’ve gone crazy from being in here so long, maybe the place makes me do it, maybe it’s a combination of both.  I don’t know why I do it, but I worry that, one day, it’ll be me you’re sitting next to, and I’ll be talking your ear off, learning your deepest, darkest secrets, and then using those secrets to break you like I’ve been broken.  I don’t know if I’ll have control over my actions at that point or not.  If you look closely at some of the patrons in here, you can see that there are tears in their eyes as they pretend that they’re having all sorts of fun.  But there are also some whose eyes are just plain empty. 

While I still have the faculties to write this now, I worry that I won’t be able to in the not-so-distant future.  I worry that the pub will consume me.  So, while a small part of me is still here and still able to write, I want to spread the message to anyone who finds this:

If you find a pub by the name of Flanagan's, don’t go in for a drink.

For the love of God, don’t go in. ",1,1764619327.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

About me:

I'm 26 years old and a data scientist / programmer.

I'm ADHD (and probably on the spectrum. I tend to hyperfixate on my interests but a few have cropped up over time and stuck with me. One of those is specialty coffee. I'm a huge nerd when it comes to excellent coffee, and I'm really spoiled by one of my local shops because it's *world class*. Another interest is Tolkien;  I got really into LOTR as a teenager but never read the main series until college. After that I became invested and read the Silmarillion and a bunch of other work by him too. I've also been known to enjoy reading court filings for fun, I've tried to tell people it's not as nerdy as it sounds but they don't believe me. I really enjoy it though!

My most recent hyperfixation has been ballroom dancing, mostly because I read almost all of war and peace, and I became obsessed with the idea of dancing a proper waltz. But I've found the activity to be wonderful exercise and helps me work through my innate wallflowerness. 

Aa far as my politics go, I'm a progressive. It kind of started as a joke in high school geography where I would pick the communist countries to give a report on them but then I got introduced to actual American leftists like Eugene Debs and I was sold. A wonderful history teacher really helped me start to think for myself.  I care about the world around me being a better place, and I hope you do too!

I love traveling and sincerely want to do more throughout life.

I consider myself a Christian. 

What I'm looking for:

I want genuine connection. I love talking about the mundane things and the deep things too, and I also love being able to switch between the two easily. I'd really like to find a best friend and a lover. I've always been obsessed with friends to lovers trope. A prime example being Pierre Bezukhov and Natasha Rostova from Tolstoy's War and Peace. If you know anything about Pierre, I've been told I'm very much like him. 


I also greatly value intention and effort. I also think the desire to grow together is a really important aspect of a relationship.

I want someone to adore! I'm very obsessed with the idea of doing the most for my eventual partner. I want to lasso the moon for a partner (if you get the reference, lmk!)

I'm comfortable with ages 22-31 or just a little outside of this for the right person.

Physically I prefer a slimmer build, whether or not you're athletic doesn't matter as much to me! I tend to prefer darker haired people but this is not a strict preference.

Intellectually, I prefer if you're college educated and still curious! (Bonus points if you're a lover of the humanities) I would like it if you have your own career goals and are actively working towards them. 

I'm open to an LDR but please be within the United States. Ideally I would prefer a life long partnership but I know that doesn't happen overnight and it will take work from both of us.

Thank you for reading all of this! I'd really like to hear what your favorite song is right now so I know you've read this message. 

[Here are some pictures of me to get a better idea of what I look like :)](https://imgur.com/a/r4r-forever-alone-dating-post-MKbPgC0)

I look forward to hearing from you!

Generic prompts = generic output = angry clients.



So I documented EVERY prompt that produced work I could send directly to clients. After 3 months and hundreds of iterations, I have 120 that consistently deliver.



\*\*These aren't your typical ""write a blog post about X"" prompts.\*\*



Each one is 3-5 sentences with specific variables, metrics, and frameworks. Here are 5 that transformed my workflow:



\*\*1. The ""$10K Sales Page"" Prompt\*\*

""Create a sales page for \[product\] at \[price\] targeting \[audience\]. Include: 7 headlines ranked by psychological impact, 3 core pain points with agitation, unique mechanism explanation, 10 benefit bullets with features, social proof strategy, offer stack worth $\[X\], and risk reversal. Format for conversions, not creativity.""



\*\*2. The ""Viral LinkedIn"" Formula\*\*

""Write a LinkedIn post about \[topic\]: Hook without emojis (10 words max), personal insight (3 sentences), data point or surprising fact, 3-5 actionable bullets, engaging question. Use line breaks every 1-2 sentences. Optimize for comments, not likes.""



\*\*3. The ""Competition Crusher"" Analysis\*\*

""Analyze \[competitor URL\]: Extract their exact positioning, pricing model, content strategy, and funnel structure. Identify 3 gaps we can exploit, 3 strengths we must counter, and specific angles they're missing. Output as actionable strategy, not report.""



\*\*4. The ""Email ATM"" Sequence\*\*

""Generate 10 email subject lines for \[campaign\]: 5 with curiosity gaps, 5 with urgency (no spam triggers). For each: character count, mobile preview, psychological trigger used, and A/B test variant. Then write the highest-converting one's body copy.""



\*\*5. The ""Content Calendar That Converts""\*\*

""Build 30-day calendar for \[brand\]: 40% educational (teaching specific skills), 20% case studies (with numbers), 20% behind-scenes, 10% engagement posts, 10% soft promotion. Each post needs: hook, platform, repurposing plan, and CTA.""



\*\*The difference?\*\* My VA now produces better copy than senior copywriters I used to hire at $100/hour.



I compiled all 120 prompts into a PDF with categories, examples, and pro tips. If anyone wants it, comment below and I'll DM the link (don't want to spam the sub).



It's $4.99 (price of the coffee that fueled this project). The 5 above are yours free regardless.

1pbn1z4,https://i.redd.it/n4fo2abjen4g1.jpeg,"got tired of busy, chaotic book covers, so I engineered a prompt for this specific ""poetic minimalist"" aesthetic with refined gold typography.","Hi everyone,

I find that most AI image generators lean towards complex, cluttered designs when you ask for a book cover. Getting something clean, elegant, and balanced is actually incredibly difficult.

I spent a few hours fine-tuning a prompt to achieve this specific ""luxury minimalism"" look. The hard part was balancing the golden typography with the glowing abstract symbol without them clashing or looking fake.

This prompt forces a ""clean white"" background (though it can be changed) and focuses heavily on ""cinematic lighting"" that creates soft, realistic golden reflections on the text and symbol. It nails that high-end, coffee-table book vibe.

If you are an author or designer looking for a timeless, refined cover style without the AI clutter, I saved the full, detailed prompt in my free app.

**How to get it:**

1. Download **Promptifex** (Search on iOS/Android).
2. Search inside the app for: **“Minimalist Golden Book Cover Prompt”**.
3. Paste it into Gemini or MidJourney.

1pbn1mu,https://i.redd.it/qo2sloefen4g1.jpeg,My birding (waist bag) bag,"Here is my stuff. I mostly do photography, frequently in the tropics. I tried to post this in the other thread but got an internal server error.

I usually carry my stuff in a waist bag with molle points on either side. It leaves my bank uncovered which is nice in tropical environments, and it keeps the weight off my shoulders which is helpful because I have a heavy camera.

The bag is from decathlon but it's discontinued and no longer available in quite a few countries. The dump pouches were from the same but I can't find them online anymore.

Attached to the molle points on the bag I have:

Two dump pouches for bulky items. These usually get filled with either nocturnal gear or the camo stuff (see below). They're big enough to hold a decent sized lens too.

A [nylon water bottle clip](https://amzn.to/48r1Zpb) either side (small bottle for illustration). Usually I'll carry 600ml to 1.2l across both of these, but they do work with e.g. 1l bottles. It's a very light solution, I find the bottles don't rock around and I don't lose any space if I'm not carrying a bottle on either side. Sometimes I'll use electrolyte tablets in the water if I'm expecting to be sweating a lot.

A [nylon locking d-ring](https://amzn.to/4ooBQxd) either side. I use these to hang anything with a short lanyard to the waist pack, like my thermal for instance.

In the bag goes:

* A [camo poncho](https://amzn.to/440biLw) \- polyester. Offers basic concealment for photography in a lightweight way. Can help keep the insects or sun off situationally too. Breathable. Be nice to get some from a lighter more packable material.
* A second waterproof camo poncho (something like [this](https://amzn.to/4pe35fn) but I don't know the exact model) - offers rain protection and can be used to cover e.g. legs or a camera and tripod for better concealment. Actually a bit lighter than the polyester one but not breathable which sucks if it is hot.
* A [camo facemask ](https://amzn.to/4pNHVER)and gloves - both offer a bit more cover for UV, insects or shy subjects. The gloves honestly sometimes get left at home particularly if it's hot.
* Insect repellent. Currently use DEET as it has some effectiveness against leeches. It is a plastic solvent though and I honestly haven't tried that much in the way of alternatives. I use a high concentration aerosol for weight reasons. Pretty indispensable in the tropics as sandflies or mosquitos can be severe.
* Sunscreen. I use small 30ml travel tubes which go a fair way with a long sleeved shirt.
* Compass - a getting lost off track mitigant. Probably I should find a smaller one
* Spare car key - this is just the key component of a broken keyfob. It's enough to get into my car (to food and water) if I lose or damage my main key.
* [Garmin Inreach Messenger](https://amzn.to/3KxF6IU) \- method to communicate and/or call for help if I'm outside phone reception (which is frequently the case).
* Water purification tablets - means I can refill water if needed without worrying about water-borne diseases. The tablets are tiny and the little roll is enough for 25 litres or something
* 1 or 2 no doze tablets. Useful for caffeination if I'm not able to get coffee in the morning. On trips I'll often just take these instead of drinking coffee - saves 10 mins of bird time or sleep time/day.
* Dental floss
* 1x Industrial strength garbage bag - this is to throw my camera in if there is a sudden downpour. Used to tuck this under my lens hood cover but the current one isn't stretchy enough.
* A packet of tissues. This is mostly to wipe my lens elements if fogging occurs due to a temperature difference between the camera and air. I find the tissue better for this because it adsorbs water.
* 1 or 2 Zeiss lens wipes
* Phone
* (Not pictured) Either a [RODE VideoMic](https://amzn.to/3M7bp1T) which connects to my phone or a prototype 3d printed parabolic microphone (hanging from one of the molle clips).
* Canon extender 1.4x and 2.0x
* Canon eos r1
* [Canon ef to rf adapter](https://amzn.to/49K9b2a)
* Canon 600mm F4 lens (latest version [here](https://amzn.to/49LAUQ3), but I have an older one). May be swapped with a 400mm f2.8 sometimes.
* [Op/tech sling strap](https://amzn.to/3XsFCLi) \- I find the neoprene the most comfortable with a heavy lens.",2,1764619074.0,BirdingGear,1,1.0,False

To give an idea of what you can earn:

•	Completing a few bonus challenges in a week can get you 100–200 points, which is roughly $50–$60.
•	Hitting a double-star day or quick promo can add up fast yesterday I earned about $15–$20 worth of free items just from normal coffee purchases + challenges.
•	Even if you’re casual with it, you can still end up with a couple free drinks a month without trying too hard.

There’s plenty of ways to earn small challenges, bonus promos, double-star days, and region-specific offers (US, UK, Canada, Australia). All very beginner-friendly.

There’s also multiple ways to redeem your points and no strict minimum.

Our breakup wasn’t messy no cheating, no abuse, no big betrayal. It was two people slowly losing each other because we couldn’t communicate the way we needed to. We talked, but nothing changed. We cared, but we didn’t understand each other deeply enough. And when things got uncomfortable, we both shut down. Eventually, that silence turned into distance we couldn’t undo.

I’m not here to tear her down or pretend she was the problem. She wasn’t. She’s a genuinely good person with a big heart, and yeah, she had her flaws everyone does. But when I really sit with it, I know a lot of the weight falls on me. I didn’t show up the way she deserved. I didn’t communicate the way I thought I did. And I didn’t realize how much my own patterns were hurting the relationship until it was too late.

Since the breakup, I’ve been owning hat. Therapy twice a week, pages and pages of journaling, actually talking about my feelings to people instead of pretending I’m fine. I don’t want to carry the same version of myself into the next chapter of my life. I've been breaking the patterns that held me back.

Lately, I’ve been wondering if it’s okay if she’d be open to meeting for coffee. To acknowledge what went wrong and take ownership, to hear her perspective and to give her space to share how she felt. I want her to feel seen in a way I didn’t always manage to do when we were together. I want to apply what I’ve been learning to have a real conversation, and share growth through action and not empty words. I’m not looking to beg, ask or convince her to come back. If reconciliation ever happened, it would have to be something she chose on her own, without me pushing. Even if she sees the changes I’m making and still doesn’t feel differently, that’s okay. She’s allowed to feel however she feels. Her emotions are valid, even if they don’t line up with what I hope for. And the growth I've had isn't lost. 

My Therapist said yes ""if she's willing"" as it's extremely uncommon for men to do this and this is good for both parties if willing to be discussed. 

She dumped me, it was amicable we held each other and cried and are still friends.

1pbmukl,https://www.reddit.com/r/midlifecrisis/comments/1pbmukl/im_having_a_super_strange_experience_of_a_midlife/,I’m having a SUPER strange experience of a midlife crisis.,"I have been feeling exceptionally lonely lately. And I’ve been toggling between Reddit and quora. Trying to find spaces where I can communicate with people and  laughter and just share information freely. It’s been hard to find a safe place where people aren’t just ballistically attacking  or being rude.

So I’m a little bit cautious to even post this because I’m a sensitive person and definitely going through at least one type of  Crises at the moment! several.

but I wanted to share my experience of what is feeling like my midlife crisis suddenly attacking me and causing some pretty deep depression that is quite discomforting and I don’t know what to do at this point.

I can’t really explain everything but I will give an example. I am a female. I grew up in the 90s. My parents were… Basically functional addicts and alcoholics who somehow skated by. They were divorced. But everyone had a place to live. we had food and clothes and cool stuff. And everyone was  OK. My mother died Fairly young however , years ago. My parents were divorced and I didn’t have a father “around” .There was a lot of  pressure in the 90s/mid 90s/late 90s to Be very thin. There’s nothing wrong with being thin naturally – but there is something kind of wrong – I speak from experience - with trying to be unnaturally very thin, when that is not your natural frame, and you have to do drugs and starve yourself or make yourself throw up to achieve it. And you hate yourself. And to not build a life for yourself because you’re so obsessed with being thin. So thIn naturally – OK. But all the people who aren’t naturally thin who are trying to be  at the expense of everything – is the part that’s not OK.

Anyways – I had body dysmorphic disorder since I was eleven years old. If you Google the actual disorder… What this means is that I had a true disorder that interrupted my life. I was a meth addict, for brief snippets of my life- But have been homeless because of it before. When not using drugs, I was Often over exercising or /bulimic. I was suicidal. Even when in recovery – which was most of my life and I’ve mostly been sober my whole life from substances – I still was a “meth addict” In recovery – and it’s still not been a very fun life.

basically – body dysmorphic disorder ruined my life.

As I mentioned, I’m 39 now. And I’m having a really strange experience that I can only imagine is sort of a midlife crisis. Where I’m old enough now to have decided what matters. I have thought my way out of my body dysmorphic disorder.

I have found my own conclusions for what I think matters and it is kindness and… Kindness basically. And trying to be there for others. That is what helps me. I don’t desire to be Beautiful anymore. You would think this feels like recovery and would be a huge relief. That’s what I had imagined if I ever got over it. And something strange has happened.

I haven’t had a body dysmorphic thought for over a year. I look in the mirror and I’m fine with what I see. I actually think that I am attractive for my age. And that’s all. I don’t obsess beyond that. I look in the mirror and I see a woman who looks damn good for her age and that’s it. I don’t think I look thin or fat or anything I think I look normal and fantastic.

And I’m more depressed than ever. Honestly more depressed than ever. I feel like my body dysmorphic disorder and obsession with my looks/weight as a female gave me purpose. Not a good purpose, but at least a purpose. Something to focus on. Something to obsess about to ignore all this sad horrible things in the world around me. It really was an escape from reality in a way.

So I’ve lived my whole life thinking this disorder is my problem and it’s caused me all these problems. And now it’s gone and I want to be here less than ever. Nothing motivates me because I don’t care how I look. I look fine and I have nothing to do. I barely want to live because nothing motivates me now. I used to go to the gym because it mattered to me to be slightly more fit. But it no longer does. I literally look basically the same without working out. And it takes up a lot less time and I don’t have to deal with people or driving or putting myself in a position where I could get in a car accident because I wanted to go to the gym to look slightly better.

I literally feel like I have nothing to live for. And that’s not to say I don’t have family or people I love because I do. But I personally feel sort of a huge void that my body dysmorphic disorder suddenly went away and I actually feel… Worse than ever. And I don’t know where to talk about this

I will mention that I know there is a body dysmorphia sub Reddit but– I  spent some time on there and read a lot of It at one point and found it to be mostly people just wanting to talk about their body dysmorphia. They didn’t seem to want help. So as an older woman who has gotten over it… Nobody liked my input. They were all just like… OK old lady. So nobody appreciated any advice I had and I’m not mad about it. Just basically felt like as a 40-year-old woman I was in a room of 20-year-old trying to say hey… Will this helped me… Or… Well this won’t always matter… But none of them can see it yet or Care and I get it. not offended lol.

So it’s starting to feel more like a Midlife crisis. It’s like I grew up as a woman finally and in my late 30s realized that I’m gonna get old and that what matters is laughter and Care… And being there for each other with family and friends and stuff… But the core thing that got me going. That got me to get up in the morning and drink coffee. That got me to scroll images of beautiful women to compare myself too. That got me to buy make up and go Shopping. That got me to go out in public to see seek attention. All these things. They’re gone because I don’t care. So I literally almost never want to leave the house and have almost become an agoraphobic instead.

Just a rant about my weird midlife crisis, as a woman. That’s all

What will happen if I call labor board. Am I able to get $ or will there store be fined?,"I have worked at this store for almost 2 years. 

I recently left. One of the reasons why I left was because I felt like I was doing too much unpaid labor. I work the closing shift. There are no paid breaks so if a customer came I had to stop and serve them. If it was a slow day it was manageable, but on busier days I wouldn't stop.  

I would not get paid If I stayed past closing. Because i was always told i should be able to get everything done by closing. Including counting the till and all other closing tasks. Someday I would get done on time, other days I would be there 20-40 min. Staying after a closing is typical for any job  but I'm not being paid. 

I was suppose to stay another week before leaving. Yesterday, a customer asked me to make a soup. I  was in the back trying to eat. I said sorry we dont have any soupst the moment because I am cleaning the area we have cookies and coffees though. Of course that was a lie but honestly I just wanted 10 min uninterrupted to eat and since its my last week working i didnt care. That customer complained to my boss and today they told me he was letting me go early. Now truthfully I didnt care cause I'm leaving anyways. However during my exchange with my boss they made comments about me not doing my job properly ( because i did not make the sandwich), and I told them that I should have called the labour board on them and to make sure I could pick up my last paycheck. I also may or may not have told them to go fuck themsleves. I wouldn't have cared if they just let me go but the lecture they were doing was annoying and I wish they would have just called me and told me to stay home instead of me leaving my house.

I honestly dont care they let me go a week early, I already put in a week notice. But that snarky commentary has bothered me. I was going to let this go and move on with my life. But I want to know, what will happen if I call labour board? Especially since I no longer work there.

Also please I am not looking for judgement. I was desperate for a job which is why I dealt with this for so long. I have some savings and will be going back to school in Jan so I will be okay.  And maybe I sound money hungry but either way I will be calling the labour board but if anyone has any stories about them getting $ or what steps i should take let me know.

I’m 27 years old and currently a Battalion Chief at a small ESD county department with 5 stations and runs 5,500 calls a year we only have Engines, Brush Trucks and ambulances. I was hired at 18, went through the departments academy, and promoted quickly: 2 years as a firefighter, 2 as an engineer, 2 as a lieutenant, 1 as a captain, and now BC for a year so far, and I’m currently only an EMT-A. I did promote out of ambition, but not for power. Rank has its privileges, but respect is earned and more importantly, I’ve always tried to earn that through a major emphasis on training, developing good firefighters who are all on the same page and aggressive on the fireground, and as I moved up in rank, always prioritizing going above and beyond to take care of the people below me.

I’m burned out from small department politics, not the job itself. The issues are inconsistent policy enforcement, micromanagement, favoritism, and constant mandatory OT. I still love the work, but the nonstop personnel problems, babysitting grown men, and dealing with egos have taken a toll. What’s wearing me down is the political and social side of the job. The truth is, I genuinely just miss running calls, training with the guys, keep my mouth shut and being a firefighter. I still have so much I need to learn about the job!

I have an opportunity to apply with a municipal department without having to relocate my wife and kids, that’s roughly twice the size of mine, with more diverse calls, specialty teams, and most importantly, Civil Service with a strong union. My current department isn’t unionized, and after seeing how inconsistent decisions can be, Civil Service protection and a structured system have become a major priority for me. This department also offers far better PTO. If hired, I’d come in as a lateral entry probationary firefighter with only a small pay cut, and I’m completely fine with that, I want to get back to running calls, making coffee, checking rigs, cleaning the station, and learning the job again. What intimidates me is switching from a 48/96 to a 24/48 with no Kelly days, and the fact that I can’t use any vacation or trades for the full probation year. I respect that expectation, but it would still be a huge adjustment and is the main thing I’m trying to realistically think through.

What I’m trying to figure out is whether stepping back into a firefighter role at 27 is the smart long term move. I don’t have an ego about the badge, I promoted young to help the department and because I wanted to grow. But now I just want to be a firefighter again, run calls, learn the job, and not be consumed by politics every shift. I’m burnt out I’m working a ton of OT, I want to prioritize work, life balance for the rest of my hopefully long career.

I’d really appreciate advice from firefighters who’ve had long careers. Is it worth giving up my current position for Civil Service, a strong union, better PTO, and a more structured system? How tough is moving from 48/96 to 24/48? Has anyone stepped back to firefighter and been glad they did? And does a move like this usually pay off in the long run? I’m not willing to work for a non civil service department again, if I ever leave my current department, it needs to be a department that’s civil service with collective bargaining.",0,1764618567.0,Firefighting,1,0.5,False

Since the ""My Turn"" MV was released, some commenters and reactors have speculated about Arem's new bass, which she named ""Coffee"", saying that they have been unable to identify the manufacturer. 

There is a reason for that :) I actually designed and built this instrument myself in 2006, and for many years she was my primary bass. The headstock logo is my initials. However life changes, age and arthritis have drastically limited my playing time, and I started thinking about passing the bass on to an artist whom I admired and would take good care of her. Naturally, since I am a huge Diadem, Arem was my first choice. So, earlier this year I sent her a handwritten letter asking if she would be interested in having it. To my amazement, she kindly responded positively and said she really wanted to hear it! And so, I said my farewells to my old companion and set about getting the bass ready for a trip to Korea. I made a new truss rod cover with **아름** inlaid in silver, purchased a new flight case, and installed her favorite brand of strings.

I intended for it to arrive at the practice room before the band left for the US-Canada tour. Unfortunately, it did not get there in time, and some drama ensued. It made it through Korean customs ok, which I had worried about since the fingerboard is made of Gaboon ebony, which is a restricted wood species under CITES Appendix II. However, when tracking finally showed ""out for delivery"", it was quickly updated to ""delivery refused""! Apparently there was a large import duty to be paid, and whoever was minding the store at Rolling Star Ent. did not want to accept it. No shade to them, and I can't blame them since it was several hundred dollars. But I was a bit panicked since it looked like I would not be able to get the bass to Arem after all, and faced the prospect of paying another $700 in shipping to get it back here to the US. At this point RQ was already in Canada on tour, communications with Arem were spotty, and I could not reach anyone at Rolling Star to clarify the situation. The shipping company and the DHL customs representative did not know what was going on either. So, for three or four days I was pretty freaked out. But finally I got another message saying that the delivery had been made! To this day I don't know what changed or who paid it, but I'm eternally grateful!

Then, one day - in fact I was waking up in a hotel room in Chicago the morning after seeing Scandal in concert - a YouTube notification popped up that Arem had posted a video on her Rumi channel of her playing her new bass ""Coffee"". Needless to say, I was totally blown away...it's no exaggeration to say it made my whole month and I didn't stop grinning for quite a while. Later, she posted a bass unboxing video and said some very nice things about it, and the cherry on top was when the ""My Turn"" MV dropped with my bass front and center and sounding amazing! I didn't even know how to feel, and I still don't, but it was the highlight of my year for sure. I hope Coffee and Arem make many happy memories together!

P.S. As a huge bonus, ""My Turn"" MV also features a sterling silver pendant necklace that I handcrafted for her birthday. I am truly blown away by Arem's benevolence in featuring my little offerings, and as a result about half of the current 500k views are probably me LOL. 

Thanks for letting me share this journey with my fellow Diadems! Not meaning to blow my own horn here, at all, but it was too good not to share :)

1pbmse6,https://i.redd.it/l7t9181m9n4g1.png,How to get Smooth rotation along a wheel axis with only 3D printed parts:,"I am working on an open source robotics project in which I am attempting to minimize non-3D printed parts to cut down on cost for the end user. a major part of the robot body is two axles with wheels fixed on either end of each axle, and the axles need to be free moving. Basically think of a basic cart.

The axle design is still going through some iteration, as you can see in the picture, the axle is not actually cylindrical. This design decision was made to reduce friction between the axle and the axle brackets by reducing contact area, and it is also easier to print the axles flat on a 3d printer bed if they aren't actually cylindrical. In prototyping, this worked well and they spun freely when rolling the assembled cart on even a very smooth surface (a polyurethane finished coffee table). 

Once I developed the prototype further and added the battery pack however, the weight from the battery pack is causing more friction on the axle and axle bracket contact points, and now the wheels do not spin freely on the test surface. 

I am trying to avoid metal bearings to minimize the bill of materials for an end user that wants to implement the design. And I don't really want to do those 3D printed bearings either because there is a lot of variability in printer quality and I don't want it to be a show stopper for someone if they can't get the bearings to print properly.

The robot will require a dozen or so M3 screws and hex nuts, so I wonder if there are options to create an axle design that utilizes some screws and nuts to promote smoother rotation, but I am really seeking a way to create a smoother rotation of the axle without needing to introduce any new non-3D printed hardware.

Let me know if you have any ideas or recommendations for better wheel axle rotation with only 3D printed parts!

1pbmpe3,https://www.ipm.org/news/2025-12-01/indiana-ave-starbucks-reopens-amid-strike,Indiana Ave. Starbucks reopens amid strike,"Last Friday, baristas from this Starbucks joined an [indefinite nationwide](https://sbworkersunited.org/the-red-cup-rebellion-expands/) strike, which began Nov. 13. The location closed on Friday and didn’t reopen until this morning. Barista and union member Sophie Lee says the store reopened today to make up for underperforming during the holiday season when students leave town. 

“We're across the street from the Sample Gates, so this day when all the students are coming back, tends to be a bigger day for business,” she said. “And they just really want those profits…they've been raising prices every year, and I've seen it since before Covid. Every year, the price of a latte goes up, the quality doesn't go up and my pay doesn't really go up. It's just the upper management and the executives who get all of those profits.” 

[Over 120 stores](https://sbworkersunited.org/the-red-cup-rebellion-expands/) and 2,500 baristas across the nation are participating in the strike. The [Starbucks Workers United Union](https://sbworkersunited.org/the-red-cup-rebellion-expands/) is hoping to negotiate a contract with better working conditions and job security. The union has been [trying to negotiate](https://sbworkersunited.org/our-fight/) a contract since last year. 

“I get paid around $16 an hour, and I usually work around 30 hours per week,” said barista and union member Eliza Ortiz. “I still don't make enough. Living in Bloomington is very expensive. I can't afford to pay rent and food or get my medication.” 

[A statement](https://natlawreview.com/article/update-starbucks-responds-holiday-red-cup-strike-coverage) sent to the National Law Review by Jaci Anderson, a Starbucks spokesperson, said strikes on Nov. 13 disrupted fewer than one percent of stores across the country. The company expected to exceed sales expectations for “Reusable Red Cup Day.” 

“The facts show people like working at Starbucks,” Anderson said. “Partner engagement is up, turnover is nearly half the industry average, and we get more than 1 million job applications a year. Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners.” 

Picketers outside the store are urging people not to go to any Starbucks location and instead to buy from local coffee shops. They plan to protest outside the Indiana Avenue location 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. every day. ",6,1764618315.0,bloomington,0,1.0,False

*ok note there will be a lot of assumptions in the later section, so bare with me pls*

  
anyway for context: we are both college students who went on a small group (\~12) 2 week long trip to a remote part of the country, so obviously the entire group bonded pretty well, at least so I thought. he is a very outspoken, loud, and pretty overconfident (?) individual so it wasn't like I never interacted with him bc he always was in every conversation. 

however, once we came back to college, I'd say hi to him if I'd see him anywhere (as I would do to anyone in this group), and he would kind of give me this judgy look and move on without saying hi, if that. we're in the same major, so we share a number of classes and same thing or he'd just ignore me. 

i don't mind it, bc honestly saves me time from the pleasantries of normal human behavior, but i'm just SO confused. he says hi to other people in the group and still talks to them, so idk why i am the one he ignores LOL. the rest of the group & I are chill and a few of us still meet up for coffee or whatnot, so idk whats up. 

theories that my friends have made, which i dont buy tbh:

1. i'm a tall female and he is a short man -> insecurities : they always bring this up but tbh there were so many short guys on the trip and they were all normal to me. 

2. i'm quiet & don't really care for the whole charade of very cocky self-absorbed people & that puts a damper on his very loud personality of ""look at what i've done"" : I sort of believe this more and kind of wonder if I reacted to one of his (many) bragging sessions in a bad way, but then again, there were many very accomplished ppl in my group and I never had any bad blood with them. then again, they didn't keep bragging about random things so maybe ??

3. it's all in my head : most realistic one, although I'm friends with a guy who was in the group as well & even he notices how differently the other guy treats me vs him in a group convo lol.

anyway pls lmk if theres any other context that can help or any thoughts u have. why do ppl do this? it's literally just a hi back",1,1764618162.0,Life,1,1.0,False

1pbmh98,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pbmh98/aita_roommate_is_mad_that_im_not_home/,AITA: roommate is mad that I’m not home,"TLDR: I got 2 new roommates , told them I wouldn’t be home frequently and they would rarely see me. Despite this I still tried to clean as much as I could when I was home (garbage and dishwasher was done by only me, and I also swiffered and swept). However, one roommate, after 8 months, lashed out at me saying I was treating the home like an Airbnb and didn’t clean enough. Should I have done more? 


Full story ; 

This happened a few months ago but I recently remembered it. 

So a while back I was a student and living in a townhouse on a shared lease. At the end of the 2024 school year, 2 of my roommates were going to be leaving and so myself and the other roommate (we’ll call here A) needed to find 2 more. It ended up falling on me, but I didn’t mind. I posted the ads, did tours and interviews and ended up finding 2 new people (call them B and C) . 

Now I was very clear with both new roommates: A and I were in an intense program and so we weren’t a good house for people looking for friends or constant going out. We would split chores and split household supplies. A house rule is that if someone wasn’t home for an entire month or longer, they wouldn’t be expected to split utilities (only the delivery charges)(I know this is weird but it was student housing in a student city and quite normal for the area.) . And I was clear that I had an internship out of the city and so I would only be home a couple days a week, and when I was home I would be mostly on school campus or at a friends house or in my room. 

I know some people really like spending time with roommates and being friends with them, which is why I wanted to make this clear. I totally get it, but A and I were in an intense professional degree and neither of us had the capacity to do that. In my free time I liked to sleep over at friends places , visit family, or just sleep. 

Despite not being home often, I made sure I always contributed. I had my own bathroom and my bedroom was separate from everyone else’s, so I took care of my space and my bathroom, expecting that the three others would take care of their shared bathroom and hallway. I kept paper towel stocked, supplied the kitchen with most kitchen tools (toaster , coffee machine, kettle, knives, etc) and I was the one who collected garbage every week and took it out and the one who unloaded the dishwasher and put everything away. On top of that I would also swiffer. Because I wasn’t home often I didn’t keep things in the common space often, besides a jacket , and maybe like some flowers or a candle. 

In Jan 2025, I started dating my current partner, and I spent more and more time at his place since his roommates were ok with partners staying over and mine were not entirely happy with that. Whatever to me. 

In May 2025 I had graduated and was not going to be living in the house. We had found someone to take over my room, but he wasn’t available to take it over until August. That was fine with me, as it let me try to find a new place to live with some time to spare. However, I was studying for a very big licensing exam and I needed somewhere quiet and to myself. Our shared home wasn’t very quiet as roommate B played loud instruments at home , and B and C often had friends over. I had no issue with that but I knew it would stress my out while studying 

My original plan was to go live with my parents in another city , but my boyfriend suggested I just move in with him until I started my new job in August , as none of his roommates would be there over the summer and he could cook for me and take care of me. Obviously that sounded amazing to me so I did that. So from May - July I lived with my boyfriend but continued paying rent in my shared house as the person they had found to take over from me wasn’t able to do so until August. 

From May - August, A also was not living in the shared house. So it was just B and C. 

At the end of May, I was asked to split utilities equally, while A was not , she was allowed to just pay delivery fees. I questioned why that was, as both A and I weren’t living there, so we should be treated the same. B then went off on me, saying I had been treating the home like an Airbnb, not contributing enough, etc. I told her I was sorry but if she felt that way she should have told me at any other point. I also told her that I contributed a lot, that most of the kitchen was stocked by me, that the garbage was constantly done by me, etc. 

She then said I didn’t clean the common space enough, and I questioned what she meant as I swept and swifered the common spaces a lot. And she said that I didn’t put things away or tidy, and I replied that it was because none of the things around were mine, they were mostly A and B’s things, and I didn’t feel comfortable moving them. This apparently wasn’t good enough. 

I just am still lost with this. Up until May , I paid utilities equally despite  being home far less than everyone else, and despite allowances being made for others (at one point A was allowed to pay less because she was only home for 2 weeks). I never complained about being the only one to do the trash or dishwasher, I swept and swiffered everytime I was home. B really seemed to be mostly upset that I wasn’t home very often, but that also confuses me because before she signed on I warned her that I would rarely be home and that she would rarely see me. Should I have done something differently? 

Edit: It’s also not like I wasn’t home ever. We had a couple roommate dinners together, and I was the only person with a car so I would often drive the others to events they were doing if it was late at night (and pick them up) and to groceries. I really tried to be a nice person to them, but I also wanted to keep my own life. To be fair, I probably could have joined more things with the roomies, I know they hung out more than I did with them, but I also feel like I made it clear before anyone moved in that I would not be that type of roommate,

I will also admit I was petty while moving out due to the above lash out (the way I was spoken to was incredibly rude and I was hurt) and so I took all my kitchen appliances , as well as the bath curtain they were using since it was mine from a previous home. I didn’t /need/ to do that, but I do use all the above at my new place, and I didn’t buy anything for the shared house, it’s all things I brought with me. But I will admit I was petty and not incredibly nice (I did however tell them weeks in advance what I would be taking so there would be no surprises) ",1,1764617807.0,AITAH,7,0.67,False

I love going for walks with my music blasting, and hiking when I have the time, love me some cute coffee dates and I do game sometimes on my switch. I also love pets, if you have one send pics PLZ. I have an alright job, a few close friends and a boring life so overall my life is pretty quiet and drama free! Really just looking to share in the monotony of day to day life with someone, the highs and lows and whatever falls between those places too. 😊

Im not really dead set on someone particular or a “type” I’m looking for (slight preference for mascs but? Not a huge deal lol), I’m very chatty and am hoping you are too though! I’d love to hear about your day everyday, your hobbies, yours passions and everything else going on! Also please have a good sense of humour! I would prefer if you were close ish to my age or a bit older (25+), and preferably from Canada or North America? I can’t do huge time zone differences, I sleep too much! 😂 I am also monogamous relationship wise, very on the fence about kids, and want to be around people who share the same values (Politically left and an atheist.) Also happy to swap selfies if you wanna see who you’re talking to! 

Please if you do reach out, please tell me your age, where you’re from and a little blurb about you so we can get to chitty chatting! Thanks for reading lmao!

I think it's been almost exactly a year since I began the journey.

I've been feeling great but I have questions I'm hoping you can help answer.

I vomited a lot of bile in the beginning (very painfully), and it seemed to worry the nurses a bit once it carried on to the second day post-op. I almost couldn't drink at all and they kept me in hydration IV. Then I suddenly got better during the second day and they let me go home.

Since then I've began the liquid diet but it seems like a lot ?

It's:

\-75g of potatoes, 50g of meat and 50g of vegetables (mixed) twice a day 

\-A high-calorie high-protein 200ml shake once a day

\-Yogurt once a day

\-Fruit purée once a day

\-One glass of fruit juice

\-One coffee/tea (they say unsweetened, can I use artificial sweeteners instead ? My program mentions it once or twice in examples but only in yogurt)

\-1.5L of water (water tastes sweet now for some reason)

I'm supposed to eat/drink all of this with pain relievers, nausea medicine, etc but I haven't needed any of it and I'm worried something is wrong somehow ?

The nurses supposed to give me those all seemed surprised I didn't need any of it, which adds a bit to my anxiety. But my heartrate is normal and everything seems fine on the surface, so they're only giving me anticoagulant right now (on top of the supplements I'm taking).

My team also said it would be very hard (and possibly painful) to eat all of this but it hasn't been the case at all.

They said I'd feel tired and lightheaded, but I don't. I feel some discomfort sometimes, but that's it. Everything negative just... didn't happen.

I'm happy about it of course, I feel great, as if I have a lot more energy than before, and I've already lost some weight I think (or at least my belt is already 1-2 holes tighter); but at the same time I'm struggling mentally.

Sometimes I'm feeling great and very excited for the future, and other times I'm just so deeply sad. 

I've been battling a few difficult things this year so it isn't exactly new and the team gave the go despite knowing, but my feelings around it all seem to just get stronger now, and I'm struggling a bit.

Is that normal ? Just an effect from the surgery ? Just me dealing with too much at once ?

I had a blood draw today and I'll know more tomorrow but everything seems normal on the result sheet except a slight inflamation.

I was 178kg before that. I have two goal weights, the ""official"" one at 120 and mine, at 90-100. 

Is that realistic ? I am fairly active due to my work, walk a lot, lift things, etc in a restaurant where I'm the dishie. And since we're cooking for ours *and* 20+ restaurants I have *a lot* of work and walk/lift a ton every day.

I'm just afraid I just... won't lose enough to feel the difference.

My mother got a Mason (which she describes as the ancestor of the Sleeve) decades ago, went from 181kg to 70kg (doing the same work), so I know it's definitely possible (and I'm a man, 20cm taller), but she also never had the food reeducation, which means she often skips food for days and is getting around it now because I'm doing it (they just didn't teach her, not entirely her fault).

here's the piece I was eyeing for along the wall. it's 30 inches high (blue tape). I adore it, but it's pricey and want to be sure it fits. I would be putting a plant and maybe a sculpture on it (about 10 inches tall) if that matters.

Are you like me and the weather has a big impact on your emotions? It's finally cold down here in Texas and maaaaaannnn I feel way more lonely. I have to confess I've been exceptionally mean to myself recently. Little mistakes just seem to make me go over the top with the ""such a useless idiot"" type of talk to myself, then after that I'm left sitting there upset. I try to be kind to myself and honestly it doesn't work? I guess I'm coming to you for a bit of external validation even if it's unhealthy. I'm just trying to be honest.

In reality, I'm not that bad. I'm 38. I rock climb now used to lift weights. I like coffee and am working on my latte art but also love a pour over. I have ONE houseplant that's been alive for 15 years. She's amazing. I like sports, not golf, but like football basketball and even formula 1. I like to read books, and this year I've focused a little more on fiction, and would like to get more into poetry. I collect vinyl too.

I won't be a bummer I swear, I hope to provide you with the following services/benefits... The fun interactions, the teasing, the shared jokes, the wanting to dress up for someone, or receive little pics, little good night texts....Just fun stuff. We can be crushes.

1pbm00p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pbm00p/im_an_urban_explorer_for_the_us_government_pt_1/,I’m an urban explorer for the US Government (pt. 1),"If you’re reading this, it means I made it past the Palantir webcrawlers. This is not entirely a mistake. If I can say anything at all, it’s because I was allowed to. That’s also why I’m posting here: disguising something as fiction and dropping it where that nobody in their right mind would think otherwise goes a long way. Who am I to judge what constitutes a “right mind” at this point. I used to think I could live with all the secrets—that the money was good enough to keep me quiet.

I’m a contractor for the U.S. government. I’m aware of how vague that sounds, but it’s the most specific I can really get without setting off alarms. My company is a pretty standard shell that coordinates dispatch, retrieval, and payment for people like me who investigate places that no longer exist.

I’m the kind of guy who couldn’t hack it at a nine to five. I’d rather dodge rental cops, sneaking into a boarded-up Cinnabon at 2 a.m. to map holes in reality, than sit in a cubicle all day pretending I don’t want to suck-start a nine millimeter.

Abandoned places are dangerous in plenty of obvious ways: broken glass, black mold, the occasional meth kitchen, or the homeless dude who has every right to be there because no one else is. As a kid, running around a dying mall or crumbling factory felt like freedom—a haven for breaking shit, tagging walls, and pretending that being edgy would somehow make me matter. It all seems insane now that I fully comprehend how getting busted or a round of tetanus shots were the least of my worries.

The last thing I’ll do is try to convince you not to go to an abandonment after telling you the things I know. Forbidden fruit being the sweetest and all. All I offer is my story—do with it what you will.

My “career” began around six years ago, under the instruction of a man I’ll call Marcus. Marcus was an explorer through and through. The guy reeked of Marlboro Reds and spent every minute between gigs researching the next spot he’d hit. He’d spent a lot of time in Europe as an exchange student. From what he told me, they’ve got it worse over there—centuries more history producing everything from abandoned villages and towns to entire industrial complexes and bunkers.

I had explored spots all over the Midwest with him and other friends on and off for about six months. I had finished up a stint of incredibly soul-draining jobs and needed the time to reset—mostly pretending I was somehow closer to deciding what to do with my life. Exploring was one of the few things I did back then that made me feel tangibly alive.

One day, when Marcus and I were supposed to meet for coffee and planning, someone else was there with him. She stayed seated but offered me her hand as I walked up to the table where Marcus was lounging. Her grip was firm, and she gave Marcus—who was oblivious to my presence, lost in his screen—a curt look before greeting me.

“Joshua, right?” “Yeah, sorry if I seem surprised, Mark didn’t mention anyo—” “That’s perfectly alright,” she said. “Marcus has kept me updated on your progress. My associates and I believe you might be just the kind of person we’re looking for. Please, have a seat.”

I smiled awkwardly and nodded in feigned interest as I sat. My patience with this lady was already wearing thin after her interruption, but I couldn’t help being curious why some suit was trying to hire me based on my qualifications as a vagrant.

“Like… a job?”

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught Marcus pausing his frantic typing to take a sip and chuckle at my confusion.

“A position is on the table, provided you meet standards,” she said. “Marcus will fill you in on the specifics. I simply needed to make contact. That will be all for now. It was a pleasure meeting you.”

She stood. Before I had time to mutter a half-hearted “Uh, sure,” she’d already strode past me, placing a hand high on my shoulder. “Good luck.”

Marcus snorted into his Americano, tossing a lazy, “Later, Judy,” in her direction without taking his eyes off the screen.

I let the silence stretch long past its third trimester before finally breaking it. “Fill me in on what? Are we still checking out the cement plant today?”

Marcus fiddled with his tabs for a moment, then spun his laptop around. Several windows were open: an aerial map, structural layouts at least fifty years old, and finally an incomplete wire transfer—the routing number of which looked suspiciously like my own.

“I find my method of recruitment more fun,” he said. “But in full disclosure, that’s higher than your normal rate on account of onboarding costs and a bonus.”

It had a lot more zeros than a Pizza Hut paystub.

“Marcus… who are you?”

He smiled the smile of a man who’d just pulled off a massive joke—but in his eyes, something else shined. The intensity of it both drew me in and made me want to look away.

“One good question begets another,” he said. “So I’ll ask you: if you see a tree fall in the woods, and it makes no sound… what would you do about it?”

“What?”

“We’ll talk shop on-site. C’mon, we’re burning daylight.” He closed the laptop and slid it into his messenger bag.

I finished the last of my cheap drip coffee and watched as he stood and made a beeline for the door, tossing a few bucks on the table for the waitress. I considered my position carefully.

I had known Marcus just long enough to go along with whatever this was. I wasn’t ready to believe it was anything other than some kind of prank.

Forty minutes later, we made it through the last town before the factory. I caught glimpses of its single, large smokestack from the freeway, but the trees obscured any view from lower down on the dirt road. Nobody seemed to be around when we passed through the main street—then again the cement plant had been shut down a few decades before I was born. There was an off-kilter swing gate blocking the access road, with a sign that said CAUTION: SINKHOLES right next to a NO TRESPASSING sign that was so sun-bleached it was hardly legible.

Marcus pulled his Tacoma sharply around to face the direction we’d come from, leaving room for me to do the same behind him. He hopped out with a different bag slung over his shoulder—something I found odd since he usually made a point of traveling light in case we had to book it.

“Leave the tourist gear for this one,” he said. “I have everything you’ll need. Otherwise, keep doing what you’ve always done. Try to just… go with it. I’m sure things are moving quickly to you, but no amount of me yapping is going to help until you see.”

“Alright then, lead on, O’ knowing one,” I joked.

He didn’t laugh.

The man before me seemed much different than the one who sat grinning across the table less than an hour ago. Now he was sober, focused on me in a way I had not seen before.

I pulled my digital camera and snacks out of my bag, then left the bag altogether just stuffing a basic first-aid kit and a few flashlights into my cargo pocket. Marcus handed me a respirator, the kind with detachable filters. We hopped the gate.

The quiet was intoxicating after a few days away from a “bando”. The fall air was thick with humidity and it suited my lungs just fine. We crossed a shallow dike running parallel to a set of train tracks before deciding to skip a sketchy looking suspension bridge that went over a decent size river

I’ll admit, to this day I’ve had a nicotine problem ever since I started running with Mark. But addiction aside, stopping to take that scene in and acclimate calmed my nerves after a strange morning. The acrid plume I slowly drew into my lungs grounded me.

“What’s the skinny on this one, Marcus? Is there some kind of plan I should follow?”

We leaned against the wall of the silo stack. Marcus and I had skipped the rest of our usual sightseeing and went straight to the area marked on his map—a break in the wall leading down into a basement.

Marcus took a moment to reposition his cigarette to the corner of his mouth before speaking, gesturing over his shoulder at the gaping hole in the earth.

“Follow my lead and do everything I say without hesitation. That’s your plan for now. Any second thoughts?” “Lead on.”

We went.

Just before the hole in the wall, Marcus donned his respirator and put on a headlamp, holding another flashlight in his hand. He adjusted the headlamp to point nearly straight at the ground, then motioned for me to press my hands to my mask’s filters and inhale—the mask sucked tight to my face. Marcus nodded in satisfaction and flashed me a thumbs-up.

“Keep an eye on your footing, and don’t leave your flashlight on anything for more than a few moments. Let’s go.”

We clambered down into the basement of the silo, ducking a hunk of ventilation duct hanging loosely from the ceiling. Everything—the thick dust hanging in the air after each step, the vulgar graffiti—was par for the course.

Marcus cracked a glowstick and dropped it at his feet. He painted a beam of light across the walls briefly, then took a left. I followed, not sure if I was starting to see things in the shadows or if the tension from the café was finally getting to me.

It was when we passed the next corner and all outside light had faded that I realized I wasn’t seeing things in the shadows. I was seeing the shadows themselves.

Everywhere I swept my narrow beam the dark seemed to shrink away from it. A chill set in my spine, like watching CG Tom Hanks in The Polar Express for the first time. If this was a prank, Marcus would’ve had to violate the laws of physics.

“Good—you noticed. That’s why I told you to keep your light moving. Needed to know if you were paying attention. The slower you move, the more obvious it is.”

He swept his own beam in circles around mine. The mist responded by growing thicker at the edges of the light.

“Don’t do that too much it seriously does piss it off though” I ignored his apparent lack of concern for my worldview shattering in real time.

“This… is why we’re here?”

“Astute observation, young grasshopper. Nictophyllosis is one of the things that likes to crop up when nobody’s around. All you need to know is: keep the light on, and keep a spare handy. At all times.”

I longed for the overcast sky outside, my off-hand wrapped tightly around my backup light as I tried to convince myself that Momma didn’t raise a bitch.

We continued. Rounding another corner, we came into the main room I’d seen in the architectural diagrams: a run of conveyor belts under the silo stack. Marcus stopped to check various side rooms and a hopper that protruded from the ceiling. Finally, he set a small cube on the ground in the middle of the room. It clicked on, projecting a square of red laser light on the walls.

“We’ll need to be a ways back for this part. Any shadow you cast makes the yield less. We really only get one shot at this.”

He placed a ceramic container on top of the cube—a rectangle the same footprint, just taller. We backed out around the corner. Marcus clicked a remote, and the laser incrementally rose toward the ceiling.

He gestured for me to follow him back in. A crackle. A faint line of soot on the wall closest to the device.

“Damn, Mark—how powerful is that thing?” “Yeah, my bad. Don’t look directly at it. That’s a lot stronger than a laser pointer.”

Now the box projected a small square on the ceiling; the dust revealed a wall of light matching the container’s sides. Marcus shone his beam at the ceiling, then flicked it downward sharply. “Gotcha.”

I reflexively inhaled as the several inches of air above the open container turned opaque—like ink blooming in water.

“Pretty neat, right? This is our sample.” He fished a small lid from his coat pocket, approaching the light field gingerly, still compressing the black matter downward with his beam.

“It could get a bit hairy after I lid it. Follow my lead. Do not panic. Do you understand?” “Y-yeah.”

For what felt like a minute, I stood transfixed as he slowly lowered the lid before clamping it down with a hiss. A chill crept down my back—too real to be imagination. Marcus’ breath came out of his mask as a fog. My fingertips burned as if dunked in ice water.

“Turn toward the exit.”

Beside me, Marcus wrestled the container, slipping a metal clasp around it lengthwise—a motion that looked easier than it probably was. The container gyrated like something inside was spinning at impossible speed.

“Hand on the wall.”

I pressed my palm to the concrete. It felt warm compared to my fingers.

“Walk.”

The pounding of my heart drowned out the ringing in my ears. My vision narrowed to a tiny tunnel. I decided the mask wasn’t going to stop me from trying to hyperventilate.

“Stop.”

I froze mid-step and slowly lowered my foot. Marcus looked at me without a hint of impatience.

“Close your eyes. Breathe deeply. Then open them.”

I obeyed. When I opened them again, pale gray light filtered down in distant rays through thick dust.

“What are we waiting for?”

“There are two things wrong with this picture,” Marcus said. “One is in your hand, and the other is on the ground. You’d better figure them out before we freeze to death.”

I stupidly looked down at my left hand before realizing—the right was still curled around the chipped corner of the wall.

“We turned left to get down here, didn’t we?” I asked.

“Correct. And what did I leave at the entrance?” “The glowstick.”

No glowstick ahead. I turned right.

The hallway that should’ve been our exit was swallowed in darkness. My beam reached only a few feet before being eaten alive.

“Fuck.”

“Close your eyes again,” Marcus said. “And keep following the wall. You got this.”

My numb right hand scraped forward along the concrete. I rounded the corner—one step, then another. We moved cautiously until the air warmed and the sound of wind swelling from outside brought me back.

I opened my eyes. The hole back to the world was in front of us. Marcus nodded toward his glowstick on the ground. “Go ahead and climb up. I’ll just be a sec.” His tone was different—lighter. That eased my mind.

I scrambled up the broken wall, welcomed the muddled sky, and pressed my back to the silo. Slow breaths. My hands rubbed together for heat. I lit up to feel something warm. Marcus emerged a few minutes later—no worse for wear. Giddy, even.

“Gnarly, right?” I managed a half-laugh. “Are you going to tell me what the hell any of this was, or what it has to do with a job?” He laughed in my face.

“Nope! Go home and rest up. Call me when you pull yourself together and if you’re still interested I’ll give you the whole spiel. Sound fair?” “Not at all, but… doesn’t seem like I’m in a position to complain. Where are you off to in such a hurry?”

He grinned. His backpack gently wriggled. “Yeah, I’ll walk you to your car. C’mon.”

I didn’t need the time off to decide. Hell, I didn’t even need the walk back. I didn’t have a clue what I’d seen, and that was a rush was unlike anything I’d ever felt.

“Is there a dental plan?” “Not really. But that’s not usually something someone making almost six figures worries about, is it?” he said, patting my back.

“Oh yeah—Judy’ll want this back.” He plucked something from my neck. Right where Judy had grabbed me earlier.

“Needed to make contact, huh?” I asked. “I thought something about that interaction was strange. What’s her deal?”

“Standard-issue vital monitor and mic. Just doing her job. Don’t worry… she’s usually not that weird.”

I couldn’t tell if he was joking, and I was too tired to care. Every time Marcus had me thinking I knew anything about him, he found a way to remind me I knew absolutely nothing.

The next morning, everyone was at their desks, ready to kick off work at 8 a.m.

I was filling Pete and Steve in on the wedding, raving about how perfectly it went.

""That's how I'd do it,"" Steve said. ""Nice and simple.""

""When I get married,"" Pete said, flashing a sly grin. ""It'll be a grand affair. Whoever she is, she'll have money, and her dad'll foot the bill.""

""Must be nice being you,"" I laughed. ""While us regular guys are out chasing, you're the one being chased.""

""Pete's God's favorite son,"" Erl chimed in from the in-charge desk, eavesdropping on our chat with a smirk.

""What's going on over there?"" Erl said, squinting at Elaine's desk like Dirty Harry.

Elaine was seated, while Kenny leaned in close, working her like a late-night comic delivering a monologue. 

They were cracking up, Elaine playfully swatting his leg.
Gary caught it and hollered, ""Hey, Rickles, you running a stand-up routine or troubleshooting circuits today?""

Kenny glanced at the clock, startled. ""Oh, shit. Didn't realize it was past eight.""
He hustled back to his desk, plugged in his headset, and picked up a call from a Bell South field tech.

""She may be over ten years older than us, but she's still got it,"" Steve said.

""With that Dolly Parton chest, tight jeans, and heels—I'm not saying I'd date her, but, you know,"" Pete added.

""I went through a messy office romance back at 32 A.O.A. I learned not to crap where I eat. But hey, to each their own,"" I threw in my two cents.

""I don't just crap where I eat. I pee, vomit, and roll around in it,"" Gary joked, a nod to his own messy fling with Lorraine.

Meanwhile, a few blocks away, Angie and Mary sat together over coffee in their building's cafeteria, both glowing as they relived every moment of the wedding.

""I can't believe I'm sitting here with a married woman,"" Mary teased. ""How's it feel, Angie? Any different?""

""It's the same for Jeff and me,"" Angie said with a soft smile. ""I was okay with living together, but with a baby on the way, we're officially a family now.""

""Gerry and I were talking last night about how special the day was,"" Mary said. ""We felt so blessed to be part of it—and part of that family you're talking about.""

Angie squeezed her hand. ""Yup. We're in it together.""

Mary let out a shy grin. ""You know, when we found out you were pregnant, my hormones went into overdrive. That night, I saw a woman with a baby on the train. When I got home, I dragged Gerry to the bedroom, and we almost went for it unprotected. I wanted to get pregnant, Angie. Don't know what came over me.""

Angie held her hand, meeting her eyes. ""I'm glad you told me, Mare. It's only natural. I'd probably feel the same if our roles were reversed. But hey, let's keep it to one impulsive pregnancy at a time,"" she said with a grin. ""You're the one who's always in control. You'll know when the time's right.""

""I know,"" Mary said. ""Sometimes I think Gerry's in more of a rush than I am.""

""Just enjoy what you've got now,"" Angie said. ""No pressure. Build your life together, get to know each other. We've got our whole lives ahead, sister.""

They gazed out at the water, quietly reflecting on all they had to be grateful for.

""Let's head upstairs,"" Angie said. ""We've got two great guys who love us. That's a damn good foundation.""

We stepped out to the courtyard next to the building for our break. Vinnie offered me a smoke, but I waved it off politely.

It was one thing to be high making deliveries or running a Xerox machine, but I had to tackle Yolanda's massive hoot-and-holler circuit later, and I needed my head clear.

""I get it,"" Sandy said. ""One time after break, Gary told me, 'Get your head out of the clouds.' I said, 'Sure, soon as I get it out of the haze.'""

After break, I jumped on a conference call with five Merrill Lynch equipment vendors across five cities. I sent them tone to measure while they shot tone back to me, allowing us to adjust their receive and transmit levels to stop the circuit from whistling.

Once they nailed it, five more vendors joined, and we ran through the process again. The work made time fly—nothing like solving a massive puzzle to make a quarter to five show up early.

On the train ride home, I debated cooking or grabbing a pizza from Lenny's on 86th Street. It was a long day, so pizza won out quick.

While waiting for the pie, I studied the photos of John Travolta on the wall, snapped when they filmed Saturday Night Fever's opening scene there. It passed the time. Lenny's pizza was solid, but it didn't touch J&V or DaVinci's on 18th Avenue. Just twenty blocks away, and I still got homesick for the old neighborhood sometimes.

As the pizza was ready, Mary came down the station steps, fresh off the train behind mine. She wasn't bummed about skipping a home-cooked meal—who doesn't love pizza?

Back at the apartment, I slid a couple of slices onto paper plates and poured us each a glass of Pepsi. We sat at the table and dug in.

""So, how was the blushing bride today?"" I asked. ""Gotta hand it to Angie, showing up to work the day after her wedding.""

""She was great,"" Mary said. ""Her boss gave her a nice gift, and the office took a collection yesterday for a card.""

""We work in good places, you and me,"" I said. ""That was the right thing to do.""

""Yeah, and Angie's taking next week off,"" Mary added.""They're visiting Jeff's parents in Florida, making a honeymoon out of it.""

""Miami's perfect for that,"" I said. ""Angie loves beaches. My office, though? It's wild. We've got a straight guy flirting with a gay woman, a May-December romance that might be something or might not, and a sordid affair that could wreck two families. Lucky for me, I'm just a spectator now that I'm with you.""

Mary laughed. ""I used to watch soap operas, but I don't need to anymore. Your office stories top anything they could dream up.""

I raised my slice in a toast. ""Who needs television when you've got real life?""

Chapter 18- Mae of Earth

It was Friday night, and Mary and I were gearing up for a laid-back evening with my buddy Charlie, aka The Dude, and his intriguing girlfriend, Mae.

I hadn't seen much of Dude since I moved to Thomas Street—definitely not as often as I'd like. But I figured we could trade quantity for quality, and a night at Farrell's Bar and Grill with him and Mae fit the bill perfectly.

I knew Mae had to be something special. For one, she was with Dude, and that alone said plenty. Plus, the way he talked about her? A new-age hippie who worshipped the Grateful Dead, could craft a bong out of anything, and wrote poetry that was equal parts profound and sweet. ""Who is this saint of a woman?"" I'd asked him.

""Come hang at Farrell's and find out,"" he'd said.

So here we were, Mary and I cruising up 3rd Avenue toward Park Slope, ready for whatever the night had in store.

We circled Farrell's a couple of times before someone pulled out on Sixteenth Street, and I slid right into the spot. Pure magic.

Mary and I walked up the block in jeans and sneakers, my kind of vibe. Meeting someone new can bring a twinge of nerves, but I felt none of that about Mae.

I held the door open for Mary. Right away, I spotted the back of Dude's head, his small bald spot peeking through, sitting in a booth across from a woman who looked like an older blend of Grace Slick and Stevie Nicks.

I slipped my arm around Mary and whispered, ""There they are.""

Mae must've caught our eyes. She said something to Dude, who turned, grinning wide, and waved us over.

We reached their booth, and I gave Dude a big hug. I extended a hand to Mae, but she brushed it aside, pulling me into a welcoming hug, then doing the same with Mary.

""Sit here next to me, girlfriend,"" Mae said to Mary. ""This way, we can admire our handsome guys.""

Mary giggled, shooting me a look, and slid in beside Mae. Dude held up four fingers to the bartender, and a waitress brought over four white cardboard containers of ice-cold draft Budweiser.

Farrell's was the quintessential corner bar, steeped in legend. Its regulars were a mix of cops, mobsters, and locals like Dude, who'd had his first beer here and loved spinning tales about it. 

The wooden floors matched the rustic vibe of the place, classic rock blared from the jukebox, and the waitresses—pretty, Irish, in white dress shirts and black jeans—kept things moving.

Jeany, our waitress, set the beers down and pulled out her pad. ""What'll it be?""
""Onion rings for the table,"" Dude said. ""The ribs here melt in your mouth.""

I ordered a cheeseburger and fries, Mary and Dude went for the ribs, and Mae, a vegetarian, chose a big garden salad.

""I'll be back soon,"" Jeany said, snapping her pad shut and hustling toward the kitchen.

""So, how long have you two soulmates been together?"" Mae asked with a warm smile. ""They look made for each other, don't they, Charlie?""

""Beautiful couple,"" Charlie said, nodding.

Mary, blushing slightly, said, ""Eight months—well, that's how long we've been living together.""

""Yup,"" I added with a chuckle. ""New job, new roommate, all at once.""

""Gerry says you write poetry, Mae,"" Mary said, her eyes bright with interest—she loved poetry books. ""Would you share one with us?""

Mae didn't hesitate. She smiled and recited, her voice steady and clear:

Something sweet can dull the ache, a kind word sees you through.

We gather here without pretense—this friendship, warm and true.

When life has left us bruised and worn, we long for gentle souls.

Look up and see: they're all around, the ones who make us whole.

Mary's eyes stayed glued to Mae, her jaw dropping at the poem's simple beauty.

""Was that off the cuff, Mae?"" I asked, honestly impressed. ""Just came to you now?""

""Yup, that's how I do it,"" she said. ""I felt the love at this table, and it just flowed through me.""

""Do you ever publish them?"" Mary asked.

""Nah,"" Mae said. ""I jot them in a notebook and share them with special people. I'd rather read them to friends than let folks read them on their own.""

""Told you she's got real talent,"" Charlie said, beaming with pride.

""Thank you for that,"" Mary said, leaning in to hug Mae.

Just then, Jeany returned with our food, pulling us back to the moment.

""My goodness,"" Mary said, wiping barbecue sauce from her mouth. ""These ribs are unreal. Here, Gerry, try one.""

I took a bite, and she wasn't kidding—they were incredible.
""Impressive,"" I said. ""The burgers are a cut above, too.""

""Farrell's beer and food keep my svelte figure intact,"" Charlie quipped, grabbing his ample belly with both hands for show.

""I love your body, fifty pounds overweight and all,"" Mae shot back. ""More for me to hold onto.""

We all cracked up at Mae's quick wit.

""So, you gonna be a shop steward for craft now that you've been at Thomas Street a while?"" Charlie asked me.

""Nah,"" I said. ""Talked to Erl about it. He's got it covered, so I'll stay a civilian. How's the local going?""

""Same as always,"" Charlie said. ""Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll. Oh, and Dale and Ann say hi.""

""Who're Dale and Ann?"" Mary teased, raising an eyebrow. ""Someone I should know about?""

A flush crept up Charlie's face, turning him crimson.

I met Mary's gaze cautiously. ""Dale's the admin VP, and Ann's the New Jersey head steward,"" I said.

""That's it?"" Mary pressed, smirking.

""Well,"" I admitted, ""I dated Ann for a bit before she went back to her husband. But that was before you, babe.""

""Wow, this is getting juicy,"" Mae said, grinning. ""Next, you'll say Charlie slept with Dale.""

""After a Christmas party,"" Charlie blurted. ""We were stoned, and it scared the hell outta me when I sobered up.""

""She went back to her husband?"" Mary asked, shocked. ""Why's this the first I'm hearing about this?""

""I don't know,"" I said. ""I never asked about your dating history.""

""All I had was my high school sweetheart,"" Mary said. ""Broke up with him a year before we met.""

""It was just a few lonely dates,"" I said. ""Haven't seen her since. Right, Charlie?""

""Right,"" Charlie said, shifting uncomfortably. ""Think I've said enough.""

""More than enough,"" Mae jumped in. ""All this means is we've got two attractive guys here.""

""You're not mad, are you?"" I asked Mary, nerves creeping in.

She burst out laughing. ""You should've seen your face! No, I'm not mad.""

Relieved, we finished our food, grateful to let the conversation pause while we ate.

We leaned back, full and content after the meal. We ordered another round of beers, though Mary switched to Pepsi.

Charlie flagged down Jeany, our waitress, for the bill.

""Let Mary handle the tip and split it,"" I said. ""She's got a knack for numbers like Mae has for poetry.""

Mary worked her magic, calculating the tip. Charlie and I split the bill, and he handed the cash to Jeany in the folder, telling her to keep the change.

""Heard you've got another talent,"" I said to Mae with a sly grin.

""You mean my bong-making skills?"" she said. ""Yup. Dry out a container with a napkin, and we'll have a nightcap outside before you head out.""

We stepped outside, strolling a bit up Sixteenth Street along the side of the bar. Mae pulled a penknife from her bag and, sure enough, turned a container into a bong in no time. I passed her a nickel bag of Danny's Blonde Jamaican weed, and she packed just enough for a small joint.

""Guess I'm definitely driving home,"" Mary teased, not a fan of pot.

The three of us passed the joint around, the mellow buzz tying a perfect bow on the night.

Mary and Mae hugged tightly. ""We've gotta do a girls' night with my friends Angie and Diane,"" Mary said warmly. ""They're gonna love you.""

""Just name the time, and I'm there,"" Mae said, thrilled to have made a new friend.

I hugged Mae and Charlie, telling him I'd call soon.
Mary and I walked up the block to the car. I was over the moon—Charlie couldn't have found a better match, and I couldn't have asked for a cuter driver.

Chapter 19- Tangled Hearts

It was Friday night, and Mary and I were gearing up for a laid-back evening with my buddy Charlie, aka The Dude, and his intriguing girlfriend, Mae.

Chapter 20- Honeymoon in Coral Ridge

Jeff and Angie's flight landed at Fort Lauderdale airport at 10 a.m. on Saturday.

Angie rented a Chevy sedan from Hertz while Jeff snagged a pair of cheap, stylish sunglasses from the airport smoke shop. In the driver's seat, Angie studied a Rand McNally road map, while Jeff flipped through a People magazine he'd picked up.

The map showed an eighteen-minute drive from the airport to Coral Ridge, where Jeff's parents lived, but Angie shaved it down to fourteen with her lead foot.

She was eager to meet them in person. Jeff's father, Manny, an 83-year-old concentration camp survivor, and his mother, Sylvia 82, whose family had escaped Germany before the worst, had immigrated to America in 1946 after the liberation. 

After years of toiling in a shirt factory, Manny, a natural entrepreneur, saved enough to buy a newsstand on 18th Avenue by the subway station. Later, he added a greeting card store on 64th Street to his ventures. 

Combined with his sharp instinct for stock market investments, he and Sylvia built enough wealth to purchase a private home on 65th Street, where they raised their adopted family.

Angie pulled into the driveway of Manny and Sylvia's ranch-style, three-bedroom home in Coral Ridge. Jeff leaned over and tapped the horn.

Manny and Sylvia rushed out at the sound, beaming as they greeted Jeff and their radiant, pregnant daughter-in-law. Manny, tall and lean, towered over Sylvia, who was average height with a warm, plump figure.

Hugs were exchanged, filled with joy. As Manny reached for their bags, Angie stopped him. ""Jeff, grab the luggage,"" she said. ""Don't let your dad carry it.""

""Are you kids hungry?"" Sylvia asked, her voice bright with her signature eagerness to feed.

Jeff, now hauling a suitcase in each hand, grinned. ""Yeah, I'm starving. What'd you make?""

""Potato pancakes and homemade blintzes,"" Sylvia announced, a world-class cook in her element. ""That'll tide you over till lunch.""

""Brace yourself, Angie,"" Manny said with a chuckle. ""Sylvia's happiest when she sees plates cleaned. You might gain a few pounds this week.""

""Oh, I'm ready,"" Angie laughed. ""My grandma Evie makes killer knishes, and Grandma Connie's lasagna is unreal. Lucky for me, I've got a fast metabolism.""

Jeff dropped the bags in the guest bedroom and made a beeline for the kitchen table. It had been a couple of years since he'd tasted Sylvia's potato pancakes and blintzes. 

They melted in his mouth, each bite pulling him back to childhood.
Angie grabbed one of each, letting out a hearty ""Mmm"" after her first taste. ""You've got to teach me how to make these, Mom,"" she said.

""Don't worry,"" Sylvia said with a grin. ""By the time you leave, you'll be ready to open a Jewish deli. I want my grandchild enjoying the same traditional cooking his or hers dad grew up on.""

""Any plans for the week?"" Manny asked. ""Treat this like a honeymoon as much as a visit.""

""I'm a beach person,"" Angie said. ""I want to hit Fort Lauderdale Beach, Pompano, and take a long drive to Miami Beach.""

""They're all gorgeous,"" Manny said. ""And we've got to squeeze in a night at the dog races. Jeff loves that.""

""What about the Hoffman side of your family, Angie?"" Sylvia asked. ""Where in Europe are they from?""

""My grandpa Sid and grandma Evie's families were from Odessa,"" Angie said. ""I think that's in Russia.""

""Odessa, yes,"" Sylvia said. ""A lot of our Brooklyn friends, especially from Sheepshead Bay, came from there. Small world.""

Manny handed Jeff a card. ""Here you go,"" he said.

""Our wedding gift,"" Sylvia added, smiling.

Jeff opened it, eyes widening. ""Two thousand dollars? Wow, thank you!"" He kissed both their cheeks.

""That's so generous,"" Angie said, hugging them tightly. ""Thank you both.""

""You know,"" Manny said, ""we'd like to cover your rent, like we did when Jeff lived alone. God's been good to us, and who better to share it with than our kids?""

Jeff shot Angie a look, nudging her to consider it.

""You're both too kind,"" Angie said firmly. ""But we're adults with good jobs. It's important for us to cover our own bills.""

""That's an honorable stance,"" Manny said, nodding. ""Jeff's in good hands, I see. But if you ever need anything, we're here.""

Angie and Jeff spent their days lounging on pristine, near-white sand and swimming in the warm, blue ocean.

""This is the life, Jeff,"" Angie said, stretching out. ""Seven minutes from home. I could get used to this.""

Her bikini still fit, though a slight baby bump was starting to show.

They stayed at the beach until late afternoon. Evenings, Angie bonded with Sylvia in the kitchen, learning to cook family recipes as if she'd always been part of the family. 

Jeff and Manny camped out in the living room watching MTV—Manny proud of his son's job, Jeff enjoying being home where his work impressed.""

On Tuesday, Manny and Jeff headed out to the pier at Fort Lauderdale Beach for a day of father-son bonding. They talked about Mets baseball, the merchants on 18th Avenue, and Brooklyn deli pastrami sandwiches. 

Each of them caught a couple of fish, but they released them back into the ocean. Manny took more joy in setting them free than in catching them.

On Wednesday night, they piled into Manny's station wagon and headed to the Hollywood Greyhound Racetrack in Hallandale Beach. Nine races awaited. 

Angie handed Jeff eighteen dollars—two bucks per race to keep him in check. They gorged on hot dogs and curly fries, and thanks to Manny's handicapping, each walked away two hundred dollars richer.

Thursday night, Angie and Jeff hit the Wharf Nightclub near Fort Lauderdale, decked out with a Miami Vice vibe—pictures of Crockett and Tubbs lined the walls, awash in pastel colors.

Angie loved to dance, and Jeff humored her, though his go-to move was barely moving at all. When How Deep Is Your Love came on, she wrapped her arms around his neck, kissing him deeply. ""I've never been happier,"" she said. ""Meeting your parents made it even better. I can't wait to come back with our baby.""

Friday, they hit Fort Lauderdale Beach again, joined by Manny and Sylvia. Manny fired up the grill for burgers at lunch, the ocean breeze carrying the smoky aroma.

That evening felt bittersweet, knowing they'd leave in the morning. Angie packed, grateful for Sylvia's washing machine, which had handled most of their laundry.

Saturday morning, Sylvia whipped up a hearty breakfast of scrambled eggs, turkey bacon, and toast. They ate slowly, savoring the food and each other's company.

""Their flight left at ten. Jeff loaded the bags while the four of them shared heartfelt hugs in the driveway.""

Angie and Sylvia clung to each other, eyes welling up. 

""Come back whenever you want,"" Manny said, his voice thick with emotion. ""This is your home.""",1,1764616631.0,u_glac1018,0,1.0,False

1pblwq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1pblwq6/it_literally_never_ever_ends/,"It literally never, ever ends","The kids are grown now, and BM is divorced again from her 2nd husband.  

But she STILL stalks me on the socials as hard as she can.  Even sent the sheriff to our tiny, tiny town of 400 people to do a wellness check in October of this year.  Their youngest kid?  33 YEARS OLD!!!!!  

So me and Jason, that's the Sheriff in my little town, we know one another, obviously.  He cruised by my house, and I was out front getting my flower beds ready for the winter.  He pets my dog who was out there with me, throws the ball for him a few times, asks me how I am, how are things, is Husband back from a work trip, how's my mom managing with my sick dad, all the things.  Then I asked about his wife and teased him about going lights and sirens the other day at 5 minutes to noon because lunch was ready and he was late.  We chatted for half an hour or more about some town gossip.  

Then he said, You know, we got a really crazy call out of California from a phone that's registered to ""HCBM's name.""  Said she wanted us to do a welfare check because she was just sure Husband was beating me and I needed help.  We live in northern Idaho, over 1200 miles from this woman.  So Miss Marie, the town's everything--water bill lady, phone answerer, 911 dispatcher, (though most of us just call Jason directly in the very, very rare occasion that anything is wrong) election official, you know, EVERYTHING, she thought it was extra strange since everyone knows husband is an aircraft mechanic in the ag industry and is gone all of October and a chunk of early November, so he wasn't even home.  

So Marie did some digging and found out that the woman on the phone was married to Husband from 1992 to 1997.  We met in 1999.  Been together ever since.  Kids are grown and gone, living their lives.  And STILLLLL this woman is trying to make trouble.  Jason said he was going to call her and scare her a little bit.  And then he said something I found interesting.  He said, ""I get now why you and Husband had that fancy attorney out of Coeur d’Alene to make you that LLC, and the LLC bought this land and that house.  I thought that was an odd thing 8 years ago when you moved in.  But now I get it.  You didn't want her to be able to get your address online from the property records.""  

I mean, that's why, but over the last decade, searches on the internet for just a few dollars will tell you everything about anyone, so it was a wasted effort.  You can opt out of them, but most make you opt out every year, or they expire, and how can you find them all to opt out of?  There are dozens, and new ones spring up all the time.  

So here it is, December 1st, Husband is home and won't be leaving again until after the first of the year.  I'm back at work after the holiday. Husband is out in his shop working on an airplane he'll rebuild and flip, which has been oddly lucrative.  He's got heat out there, but pushed the plane out this morning because he got the landing gear in and had to take 10,000 pictures of every tiny bit of this thing.  Who should happen by?  If you guessed the Sheriff, you win a gold star!!  He comes inside the shop, pours himself some coffee, gets comfy in the shop man cave, and says, ""You might need to call that fancy attorney you got up in Coeur d’Alene.""  What on earth for, Husband asks?  Turns out, HCBM called the state police to report that Husband and I have a growing operation in a state where it's illegal.  Now, Jason has been inside my house MANY times, and he and his wife are friends of ours.  I fed him a big ol' plate of food on Veteran's Day because he is one, and so are several of my old men neighbors whom I took food to.  Jason was also the person we asked to feed our dog when I was in the hospital in Spokane last year.  So this man is totally familiar with us and our home.  The state police called him to inform him of the call, and he told them that it was absurd and that he knew us personally very well. By the way, what was the caller's name???  If you guessed HCBM, you're RIGHT again!!!  So he suggested to Husband this morning that we have her served with a cease and desist letter telling her to stop her crap, and then if she does NOT stop her crap, that same attorney can get us a court order that has legal consequences.  WHY are we dealing with this in 2025/2026???  WHY???  They haven't been married for 28+ years!!!!

The next morning, everyone was at their desks, ready to kick off work at 8 a.m.

I was filling Pete and Steve in on the wedding, raving about how perfectly it went.

""That's how I'd do it,"" Steve said. ""Nice and simple.""

""When I get married,"" Pete said, flashing a sly grin. ""It'll be a grand affair. Whoever she is, she'll have money, and her dad'll foot the bill.""

""Must be nice being you,"" I laughed. ""While us regular guys are out chasing, you're the one being chased.""

""Pete's God's favorite son,"" Erl chimed in from the in-charge desk, eavesdropping on our chat with a smirk.

""What's going on over there?"" Erl said, squinting at Elaine's desk like Dirty Harry.

Elaine was seated, while Kenny leaned in close, working her like a late-night comic delivering a monologue. 

They were cracking up, Elaine playfully swatting his leg.
Gary caught it and hollered, ""Hey, Rickles, you running a stand-up routine or troubleshooting circuits today?""

Kenny glanced at the clock, startled. ""Oh, shit. Didn't realize it was past eight.""
He hustled back to his desk, plugged in his headset, and picked up a call from a Bell South field tech.

""She may be over ten years older than us, but she's still got it,"" Steve said.

""With that Dolly Parton chest, tight jeans, and heels—I'm not saying I'd date her, but, you know,"" Pete added.

""I went through a messy office romance back at 32 A.O.A. I learned not to crap where I eat. But hey, to each their own,"" I threw in my two cents.

""I don't just crap where I eat. I pee, vomit, and roll around in it,"" Gary joked, a nod to his own messy fling with Lorraine.

Meanwhile, a few blocks away, Angie and Mary sat together over coffee in their building's cafeteria, both glowing as they relived every moment of the wedding.

""I can't believe I'm sitting here with a married woman,"" Mary teased. ""How's it feel, Angie? Any different?""

""It's the same for Jeff and me,"" Angie said with a soft smile. ""I was okay with living together, but with a baby on the way, we're officially a family now.""

""Gerry and I were talking last night about how special the day was,"" Mary said. ""We felt so blessed to be part of it—and part of that family you're talking about.""

Angie squeezed her hand. ""Yup. We're in it together.""

Mary let out a shy grin. ""You know, when we found out you were pregnant, my hormones went into overdrive. That night, I saw a woman with a baby on the train. When I got home, I dragged Gerry to the bedroom, and we almost went for it unprotected. I wanted to get pregnant, Angie. Don't know what came over me.""

Angie held her hand, meeting her eyes. ""I'm glad you told me, Mare. It's only natural. I'd probably feel the same if our roles were reversed. But hey, let's keep it to one impulsive pregnancy at a time,"" she said with a grin. ""You're the one who's always in control. You'll know when the time's right.""

""I know,"" Mary said. ""Sometimes I think Gerry's in more of a rush than I am.""

""Just enjoy what you've got now,"" Angie said. ""No pressure. Build your life together, get to know each other. We've got our whole lives ahead, sister.""

They gazed out at the water, quietly reflecting on all they had to be grateful for.

""Let's head upstairs,"" Angie said. ""We've got two great guys who love us. That's a damn good foundation.""

We stepped out to the courtyard next to the building for our break. Vinnie offered me a smoke, but I waved it off politely.

It was one thing to be high making deliveries or running a Xerox machine, but I had to tackle Yolanda's massive hoot-and-holler circuit later, and I needed my head clear.

""I get it,"" Sandy said. ""One time after break, Gary told me, 'Get your head out of the clouds.' I said, 'Sure, soon as I get it out of the haze.'""

After break, I jumped on a conference call with five Merrill Lynch equipment vendors across five cities. I sent them tone to measure while they shot tone back to me, allowing us to adjust their receive and transmit levels to stop the circuit from whistling.

Once they nailed it, five more vendors joined, and we ran through the process again. The work made time fly—nothing like solving a massive puzzle to make a quarter to five show up early.

On the train ride home, I debated cooking or grabbing a pizza from Lenny's on 86th Street. It was a long day, so pizza won out quick.

While waiting for the pie, I studied the photos of John Travolta on the wall, snapped when they filmed Saturday Night Fever's opening scene there. It passed the time. Lenny's pizza was solid, but it didn't touch J&V or DaVinci's on 18th Avenue. Just twenty blocks away, and I still got homesick for the old neighborhood sometimes.

As the pizza was ready, Mary came down the station steps, fresh off the train behind mine. She wasn't bummed about skipping a home-cooked meal—who doesn't love pizza?

Back at the apartment, I slid a couple of slices onto paper plates and poured us each a glass of Pepsi. We sat at the table and dug in.

""So, how was the blushing bride today?"" I asked. ""Gotta hand it to Angie, showing up to work the day after her wedding.""

""She was great,"" Mary said. ""Her boss gave her a nice gift, and the office took a collection yesterday for a card.""

""We work in good places, you and me,"" I said. ""That was the right thing to do.""

""Yeah, and Angie's taking next week off,"" Mary added.""They're visiting Jeff's parents in Florida, making a honeymoon out of it.""

""Miami's perfect for that,"" I said. ""Angie loves beaches. My office, though? It's wild. We've got a straight guy flirting with a gay woman, a May-December romance that might be something or might not, and a sordid affair that could wreck two families. Lucky for me, I'm just a spectator now that I'm with you.""

Mary laughed. ""I used to watch soap operas, but I don't need to anymore. Your office stories top anything they could dream up.""

I raised my slice in a toast. ""Who needs television when you've got real life?""

Chapter 18- Mae of Earth

It was Friday night, and Mary and I were gearing up for a laid-back evening with my buddy Charlie, aka The Dude, and his intriguing girlfriend, Mae.

I hadn't seen much of Dude since I moved to Thomas Street—definitely not as often as I'd like. But I figured we could trade quantity for quality, and a night at Farrell's Bar and Grill with him and Mae fit the bill perfectly.

I knew Mae had to be something special. For one, she was with Dude, and that alone said plenty. Plus, the way he talked about her? A new-age hippie who worshipped the Grateful Dead, could craft a bong out of anything, and wrote poetry that was equal parts profound and sweet. ""Who is this saint of a woman?"" I'd asked him.

""Come hang at Farrell's and find out,"" he'd said.

So here we were, Mary and I cruising up 3rd Avenue toward Park Slope, ready for whatever the night had in store.

We circled Farrell's a couple of times before someone pulled out on Sixteenth Street, and I slid right into the spot. Pure magic.

Mary and I walked up the block in jeans and sneakers, my kind of vibe. Meeting someone new can bring a twinge of nerves, but I felt none of that about Mae.

I held the door open for Mary. Right away, I spotted the back of Dude's head, his small bald spot peeking through, sitting in a booth across from a woman who looked like an older blend of Grace Slick and Stevie Nicks.

I slipped my arm around Mary and whispered, ""There they are.""

Mae must've caught our eyes. She said something to Dude, who turned, grinning wide, and waved us over.

We reached their booth, and I gave Dude a big hug. I extended a hand to Mae, but she brushed it aside, pulling me into a welcoming hug, then doing the same with Mary.

""Sit here next to me, girlfriend,"" Mae said to Mary. ""This way, we can admire our handsome guys.""

Mary giggled, shooting me a look, and slid in beside Mae. Dude held up four fingers to the bartender, and a waitress brought over four white cardboard containers of ice-cold draft Budweiser.

Farrell's was the quintessential corner bar, steeped in legend. Its regulars were a mix of cops, mobsters, and locals like Dude, who'd had his first beer here and loved spinning tales about it. 

The wooden floors matched the rustic vibe of the place, classic rock blared from the jukebox, and the waitresses—pretty, Irish, in white dress shirts and black jeans—kept things moving.

Jeany, our waitress, set the beers down and pulled out her pad. ""What'll it be?""
""Onion rings for the table,"" Dude said. ""The ribs here melt in your mouth.""

I ordered a cheeseburger and fries, Mary and Dude went for the ribs, and Mae, a vegetarian, chose a big garden salad.

""I'll be back soon,"" Jeany said, snapping her pad shut and hustling toward the kitchen.

""So, how long have you two soulmates been together?"" Mae asked with a warm smile. ""They look made for each other, don't they, Charlie?""

""Beautiful couple,"" Charlie said, nodding.

Mary, blushing slightly, said, ""Eight months—well, that's how long we've been living together.""

""Yup,"" I added with a chuckle. ""New job, new roommate, all at once.""

""Gerry says you write poetry, Mae,"" Mary said, her eyes bright with interest—she loved poetry books. ""Would you share one with us?""

Mae didn't hesitate. She smiled and recited, her voice steady and clear:

Something sweet can dull the ache, a kind word sees you through.

We gather here without pretense—this friendship, warm and true.

When life has left us bruised and worn, we long for gentle souls.

Look up and see: they're all around, the ones who make us whole.

Mary's eyes stayed glued to Mae, her jaw dropping at the poem's simple beauty.

""Was that off the cuff, Mae?"" I asked, honestly impressed. ""Just came to you now?""

""Yup, that's how I do it,"" she said. ""I felt the love at this table, and it just flowed through me.""

""Do you ever publish them?"" Mary asked.

""Nah,"" Mae said. ""I jot them in a notebook and share them with special people. I'd rather read them to friends than let folks read them on their own.""

""Told you she's got real talent,"" Charlie said, beaming with pride.

""Thank you for that,"" Mary said, leaning in to hug Mae.

Just then, Jeany returned with our food, pulling us back to the moment.

""My goodness,"" Mary said, wiping barbecue sauce from her mouth. ""These ribs are unreal. Here, Gerry, try one.""

I took a bite, and she wasn't kidding—they were incredible.
""Impressive,"" I said. ""The burgers are a cut above, too.""

""Farrell's beer and food keep my svelte figure intact,"" Charlie quipped, grabbing his ample belly with both hands for show.

""I love your body, fifty pounds overweight and all,"" Mae shot back. ""More for me to hold onto.""

We all cracked up at Mae's quick wit.

""So, you gonna be a shop steward for craft now that you've been at Thomas Street a while?"" Charlie asked me.

""Nah,"" I said. ""Talked to Erl about it. He's got it covered, so I'll stay a civilian. How's the local going?""

""Same as always,"" Charlie said. ""Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll. Oh, and Dale and Ann say hi.""

""Who're Dale and Ann?"" Mary teased, raising an eyebrow. ""Someone I should know about?""

A flush crept up Charlie's face, turning him crimson.

I met Mary's gaze cautiously. ""Dale's the admin VP, and Ann's the New Jersey head steward,"" I said.

""That's it?"" Mary pressed, smirking.

""Well,"" I admitted, ""I dated Ann for a bit before she went back to her husband. But that was before you, babe.""

""Wow, this is getting juicy,"" Mae said, grinning. ""Next, you'll say Charlie slept with Dale.""

""After a Christmas party,"" Charlie blurted. ""We were stoned, and it scared the hell outta me when I sobered up.""

""She went back to her husband?"" Mary asked, shocked. ""Why's this the first I'm hearing about this?""

""I don't know,"" I said. ""I never asked about your dating history.""

""All I had was my high school sweetheart,"" Mary said. ""Broke up with him a year before we met.""

""It was just a few lonely dates,"" I said. ""Haven't seen her since. Right, Charlie?""

""Right,"" Charlie said, shifting uncomfortably. ""Think I've said enough.""

""More than enough,"" Mae jumped in. ""All this means is we've got two attractive guys here.""

""You're not mad, are you?"" I asked Mary, nerves creeping in.

She burst out laughing. ""You should've seen your face! No, I'm not mad.""

Relieved, we finished our food, grateful to let the conversation pause while we ate.

We leaned back, full and content after the meal. We ordered another round of beers, though Mary switched to Pepsi.

Charlie flagged down Jeany, our waitress, for the bill.

""Let Mary handle the tip and split it,"" I said. ""She's got a knack for numbers like Mae has for poetry.""

Mary worked her magic, calculating the tip. Charlie and I split the bill, and he handed the cash to Jeany in the folder, telling her to keep the change.

""Heard you've got another talent,"" I said to Mae with a sly grin.

""You mean my bong-making skills?"" she said. ""Yup. Dry out a container with a napkin, and we'll have a nightcap outside before you head out.""

We stepped outside, strolling a bit up Sixteenth Street along the side of the bar. Mae pulled a penknife from her bag and, sure enough, turned a container into a bong in no time. I passed her a nickel bag of Danny's Blonde Jamaican weed, and she packed just enough for a small joint.

""Guess I'm definitely driving home,"" Mary teased, not a fan of pot.

The three of us passed the joint around, the mellow buzz tying a perfect bow on the night.

Mary and Mae hugged tightly. ""We've gotta do a girls' night with my friends Angie and Diane,"" Mary said warmly. ""They're gonna love you.""

""Just name the time, and I'm there,"" Mae said, thrilled to have made a new friend.

I hugged Mae and Charlie, telling him I'd call soon.
Mary and I walked up the block to the car. I was over the moon—Charlie couldn't have found a better match, and I couldn't have asked for a cuter driver.

Chapter 19- Tangled Hearts

Chapter 20- Honeymoon in Coral Ridge

Jeff and Angie's flight landed at Fort Lauderdale airport at 10 a.m. on Saturday.

Angie rented a Chevy sedan from Hertz while Jeff snagged a pair of cheap, stylish sunglasses from the airport smoke shop. In the driver's seat, Angie studied a Rand McNally road map, while Jeff flipped through a People magazine he'd picked up.

The map showed an eighteen-minute drive from the airport to Coral Ridge, where Jeff's parents lived, but Angie shaved it down to fourteen with her lead foot.

She was eager to meet them in person. Jeff's father, Manny, an 83-year-old concentration camp survivor, and his mother, Sylvia 82, whose family had escaped Germany before the worst, had immigrated to America in 1946 after the liberation. 

After years of toiling in a shirt factory, Manny, a natural entrepreneur, saved enough to buy a newsstand on 18th Avenue by the subway station. Later, he added a greeting card store on 64th Street to his ventures. 

Combined with his sharp instinct for stock market investments, he and Sylvia built enough wealth to purchase a private home on 65th Street, where they raised their adopted family.

Angie pulled into the driveway of Manny and Sylvia's ranch-style, three-bedroom home in Coral Ridge. Jeff leaned over and tapped the horn.

Manny and Sylvia rushed out at the sound, beaming as they greeted Jeff and their radiant, pregnant daughter-in-law. Manny, tall and lean, towered over Sylvia, who was average height with a warm, plump figure.

Hugs were exchanged, filled with joy. As Manny reached for their bags, Angie stopped him. ""Jeff, grab the luggage,"" she said. ""Don't let your dad carry it.""

""Are you kids hungry?"" Sylvia asked, her voice bright with her signature eagerness to feed.

Jeff, now hauling a suitcase in each hand, grinned. ""Yeah, I'm starving. What'd you make?""

""Potato pancakes and homemade blintzes,"" Sylvia announced, a world-class cook in her element. ""That'll tide you over till lunch.""

""Brace yourself, Angie,"" Manny said with a chuckle. ""Sylvia's happiest when she sees plates cleaned. You might gain a few pounds this week.""

""Oh, I'm ready,"" Angie laughed. ""My grandma Evie makes killer knishes, and Grandma Connie's lasagna is unreal. Lucky for me, I've got a fast metabolism.""

Jeff dropped the bags in the guest bedroom and made a beeline for the kitchen table. It had been a couple of years since he'd tasted Sylvia's potato pancakes and blintzes. 

They melted in his mouth, each bite pulling him back to childhood.
Angie grabbed one of each, letting out a hearty ""Mmm"" after her first taste. ""You've got to teach me how to make these, Mom,"" she said.

""Don't worry,"" Sylvia said with a grin. ""By the time you leave, you'll be ready to open a Jewish deli. I want my grandchild enjoying the same traditional cooking his or hers dad grew up on.""

""Any plans for the week?"" Manny asked. ""Treat this like a honeymoon as much as a visit.""

""I'm a beach person,"" Angie said. ""I want to hit Fort Lauderdale Beach, Pompano, and take a long drive to Miami Beach.""

""They're all gorgeous,"" Manny said. ""And we've got to squeeze in a night at the dog races. Jeff loves that.""

""What about the Hoffman side of your family, Angie?"" Sylvia asked. ""Where in Europe are they from?""

""My grandpa Sid and grandma Evie's families were from Odessa,"" Angie said. ""I think that's in Russia.""

""Odessa, yes,"" Sylvia said. ""A lot of our Brooklyn friends, especially from Sheepshead Bay, came from there. Small world.""

Manny handed Jeff a card. ""Here you go,"" he said.

""Our wedding gift,"" Sylvia added, smiling.

Jeff opened it, eyes widening. ""Two thousand dollars? Wow, thank you!"" He kissed both their cheeks.

""That's so generous,"" Angie said, hugging them tightly. ""Thank you both.""

""You know,"" Manny said, ""we'd like to cover your rent, like we did when Jeff lived alone. God's been good to us, and who better to share it with than our kids?""

Jeff shot Angie a look, nudging her to consider it.

""You're both too kind,"" Angie said firmly. ""But we're adults with good jobs. It's important for us to cover our own bills.""

""That's an honorable stance,"" Manny said, nodding. ""Jeff's in good hands, I see. But if you ever need anything, we're here.""

Angie and Jeff spent their days lounging on pristine, near-white sand and swimming in the warm, blue ocean.

""This is the life, Jeff,"" Angie said, stretching out. ""Seven minutes from home. I could get used to this.""

Her bikini still fit, though a slight baby bump was starting to show.

They stayed at the beach until late afternoon. Evenings, Angie bonded with Sylvia in the kitchen, learning to cook family recipes as if she'd always been part of the family. 

Jeff and Manny camped out in the living room watching MTV—Manny proud of his son's job, Jeff enjoying being home where his work impressed.""

On Tuesday, Manny and Jeff headed out to the pier at Fort Lauderdale Beach for a day of father-son bonding. They talked about Mets baseball, the merchants on 18th Avenue, and Brooklyn deli pastrami sandwiches. 

Each of them caught a couple of fish, but they released them back into the ocean. Manny took more joy in setting them free than in catching them.

On Wednesday night, they piled into Manny's station wagon and headed to the Hollywood Greyhound Racetrack in Hallandale Beach. Nine races awaited. 

Angie handed Jeff eighteen dollars—two bucks per race to keep him in check. They gorged on hot dogs and curly fries, and thanks to Manny's handicapping, each walked away two hundred dollars richer.

Thursday night, Angie and Jeff hit the Wharf Nightclub near Fort Lauderdale, decked out with a Miami Vice vibe—pictures of Crockett and Tubbs lined the walls, awash in pastel colors.

Angie loved to dance, and Jeff humored her, though his go-to move was barely moving at all. When How Deep Is Your Love came on, she wrapped her arms around his neck, kissing him deeply.

Friday, they hit Fort Lauderdale Beach again, joined by Manny and Sylvia. Manny fired up the grill for burgers at lunch, the ocean breeze carrying the smoky aroma.

That evening felt bittersweet, knowing they'd leave in the morning. Angie packed, grateful for Sylvia's washing machine, which had handled most of their laundry.

Saturday morning, Sylvia whipped up a hearty breakfast of scrambled eggs, turkey bacon, and toast. They ate slowly, savoring the food and each other's company.

""Their flight left at ten. Jeff loaded the bags while the four of them shared heartfelt hugs in the driveway.""

Angie and Sylvia clung to each other, eyes welling up.

I am a stay at home mom to 2 boys, 3 years and 1 year old. I had severe PPD, and was put on Lexapro which is helping a lot. From when my youngest son was 3 months old until now, we had a nanny come help me with the kids which also helped a ton. First she only watched my toddler at my home, but that nanny moved so we found another (a distant family friend) who’s been with us for the last 3 months. She was with both kids for 10 hours per week. The issue is that I have a nanny cam and I saw her rough handle my toddler and discipline him in a way I never approved. Basically she yelled at him for not cleaning his plate, then pulled/dragged him to a different time out spot than we told her we use, and then pulled him to another spot. I also saw that she’s on her phone the majority of the time, and a few times we found out she drove to another town with my kids and went shopping at the Dollar Store, went on 45 minute coffee runs, and left my kids in her car while she went into her house to pick something up to bring to her teenage son at school. 

I told my husband I needed to fire her. I was scared to get rid of the only help we have. He talked to her and let her go. I’m scared of what’s to come- 5 days/week with both kids by myself. We don’t have family close enough to help out, and all of my girl friends work full time and none have kids.

I think I just need a pep talk or a kick in the butt telling me I can do this. I’m not sure why I feel so bad about this.

1pblpi4,https://i.redd.it/io20gw8o5n4g1.jpeg,"A Little Intelligence, And A Lot Less Obtuse, With All That Perspective, Please","I swiped the screenshot from r/BoomersBeingFools and the post titled Shut Up, Judy. The following is the comment I made on a different profile. 

************

Apologies for typos. I’m half asleep. I think I got most of them. Aww shit! I thought this obtuse boomer was talking about buying a horse. I really am half asleep. I just noticed she said house, not horse. The principles are the same though. Though I elaborated my original comment to accommodate my boo-boo. 

Or….you could just continue to live at your parent’s home and mooch. That’s pretty much how young people solve their financial woes today without giving anything up. But truthfully, this boomer is full of shit. All the things mentioned can be expensive. It just depends. Keeping a horse is fucking expensive no matter where you live. If in town, you must rent or own property or stable space out in the country. If you live in the country, you have to drive everywhere. This person fails to mention in-town living accommodations are expensive. You have to live out in the middle of nowhere to find a place you can afford that allows dogs and horses. Which means you have to drive 25-30 minutes at least, into town to shop for groceries. Gas costs money. Wear and tear costs money and more quickly depreciates your vehicle, which affects resale prices. Breaking down on the side of a lonely road or running out of gas in these situations is not recommended unless you have a cell phone. Even calling AAA requires access to a phone and remaining with your vehicle. And what boomer doesn’t have jitterbug or another cellular service product? Public phones were not free. They cost money too. And they could be dangerous places. It costs more to drive around town to buy supplies at stores for a premium price, than it does to buy on Amazon and have it delivered. Gas isn’t $0.10 per gallon. Houses don’t cost a few thousand and cars aren’t $600 or less. Younger generations can’t afford to continue to pollute and be wasteful with valuable resources the way Boomers shouldn’t have done either. Younger generations can’t piss off and die when the world is trashed because of what older generations like Boomers did to the environment. The global warming we see now isn’t from activities performed yesterday. Effects continue to cascade from activities performed 50-60 years ago. The activities performed yesterday, will continue to cascade for the next 50-60 years. 

The only things I’d say that I might agree with this stoic living is regards to children. Some internet and tv is fine. But they gain more growth mentally, emotionally, intellectually, creatively and socially when they play outside together. That’s one thing. The other is eating out and ordering out are expenses just about anyone could cut, and save a ton of money. That’s just sound money advice. All else? Internet? You can’t function without it now because the business world pays a contract webmaster or employee much less than a lot of customer service people at a desk in the store, to deal with issues now done online by a call centre in india because the business is owned by a boomer, who is more apt to worry about accumulating personal wealth, than growing the economy, which increases everyone’s wealth. The onsite customer service desk requires longer hours, more utilities costs, a bigger footprint in terms of space for the business, in a place that makes them competitive—usually an in town location that’s central to current and potential customers in the area, and it costs more to be there. That drives prices up for products and services which is bad for the economy, not to mention the environment. The greed of boomers has so badly affected the economy, young people are generally fucked. UNLESS boomer grandparents or Gen X parents bail them out, help them buy a car, a house, deal with divorce and being a single parent. And divorce rates are astronomical. Young people don’t even bother to get married? No doubt they see little reason to if they’ll need an expensive divorce in 5-10 years time. Young people have to work 2 to 3 jobs apiece to not get any retirement set aside, or medical and dental coverage, to be fired when sick or pregnant though generally protected by FMLA depending on how your state defines certain types of workers, and that time apart, no time together, leads to the breakup of the family unit. It has nothing to do with gay people or democrats or any other political or philosophical or sexual orientation. It has mainly to do with greed. Only boomers are rich enough to be that greedy anymore. They created the situation of social, cultural and economic instability. THEY did. 

Boomers, like most older generations, tend to have an arrogance that they did things the way they should be done. What they did cannot be done anymore, and not be extremely costly to opportunity costs like time spent away from family, to the pocketbook, and to the environment. 

The world is not the same as when boomers were in their 20s. The world is not the same when my generation, Gen X, was in their 20s. Those worlds and realities don’t exist anymore. You have to adapt. It isn’t possible to go back and do it like other generations did.

Artist Profile
DANIEL JUNGLE RIDDIM

Daniel is a versatile photographer whose work spans portraits, landscapes, cityscapes, and
the quiet beauty of nature. His first published images were taken while studying abroad in England in 1999 which ignited a passion for discovering and framing moments of everyday
wonder, whether in human expression, vast horizons, or the energy of urban life.

A keen observer, he often pauses to photograph bees wherever they appear: wild meadows, city sidewalks, or parking-lot planters. What began as a personal practice of “stopping to smell the roses” has become a gentle reminder that presence and attention reveal the extraordinary in the ordinary.

Having previously explored creativity through music and cooking, Daniel is excited to channel his curiosity and artistic expression into photography as well. This debut solo exhibition presents a selection of recent portraits, landscapes, cityscapes, and nature studies, including intimate encounters with the small, industrious lives that
share our world.

1pblmuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1pblmuw/flicker_automates_vintage_bookshop_weekends_with/,Flicker - Automates Vintage Bookshop Weekends with Make and Bookmanager,"I just conjured a dusty, beautiful automation for a tiny second-hand bookshop owner in Pécs who was drowning every Friday afternoon. New boxes of donated books arrived, weekend browsers tripled, Instagram had to be fed, and the cat still needed feeding, all while the till rang non-stop. So I created Flicker, an automation that smells like old paper and coffee, turning the glorious weekend chaos into quiet, profitable poetry.

Flicker uses Make as the silent bookseller and Bookmanager (the simple system most Hungarian antiquarian shops use) to keep the shelves singing. It’s gentle, nostalgic, and runs like a well-loved novel. Here’s how Flicker turns pages:

1. Every new donation box is photographed with a phone → Make instantly reads titles via Google Lens, adds them to Bookmanager, and prices them using the shop’s secret formula.
2. Friday 16:00 it picks the 12 most beautiful new arrivals, creates a dreamy Instagram carousel (“Weekend treasures just landed”), and schedules it for Saturday 10:00.
3. When a book sells, Make texts the owner one line: “1952 Móra Ferenc first edition just found its new home – 9 800 Ft in the till.”
4. Sunday 18:00 it posts a single story: “Thank you for another weekend of stories. These 7 books are still waiting for you…” with atmospheric shelf photos.
5. Monday morning the owner wakes up to one Slack message: “Weekend total 187 400 Ft, 43 books rehomed, cat fed, soul happy. Coffee’s on the counter.”

This setup is pure love for antiquarian booksellers, tiny vintage shops, or anyone selling pieces of history. It turns weekend overwhelm into a gentle, magical rhythm where the books do most of the talking.

Happy automating, and may your pages always turn gently.",2,1764615945.0,automation,2,1.0,False

In short about me Dutch 34M have been living in Tilburg for some time. But due to some circumstances and a pretty nasty depression I had. I find myself without people or friends that live in the neighbourhood to just grab a coffee, have a good talk or an impromptu activity.

Not trying to be sad or pathetic, just trying to meet new people and maybe make some friends. Im curious about almost everything, like cooking while having a drink or one of both, craft stuff or just a nice convo about absolutely everything. ",1,1764615926.0,Tilburg,1,0.67,False

So I work at a coffee bar in a hotel, it's a pretty small operation normally only one person works the coffee bar, while whoever works front desk can fill in if the barista needs to do something else. I'm in my 30s and I have over 5 professional years as a barista under my belt and have been making espresso drinks since my early 20s. I had to use the bathroom, so one of the front desk managers filled in, when I came back I saw her making a drink for a customer, but for some reason they took the espresso from the maker put the cup on the sink we use to wash dishes (on the flat part where you set dishes before putting them in the sink itself) then poured the steamed milk into the espresso. After I told them what they where doing was wrong, they get upset with me telling me ""that (they) prefer to make drinks there,"" and that I shouldn't correct them because ""(they) have a good handlers license."" Needless to say I myself am pretty upset because even though they are front desk manager and also a coffee bar manager they should know that is against health department regulations. Am I overreacting though? Would anyone else get upset if they saw a coworker do what I just saw? I know my boss won't listen because they have a bout as much kitchen experience as a boomer who's never worked a kitchen before... Because that's exactly what my boss is.

1pbljhe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pbljhe,[roleplay] They can't be that good brother,"So here's what happened:

I was walking around down the street the other day then I saw this young man wearing a windbreaker walking towards the same cafe I usually visit the other day and nicely enough of him he opened the door for me

As I walked to the cashier and ordered my coffee while going back I noticed that this cafe was giving away Sample of this ""Desi pie"" they talk about and then what flabbergasted the most that this young man took one and suddenly I found him on his knees slamming the floor.

They can't be this good bro. Then when I looked outside I found a bunch of people doing the same as if they too had tasted it and felt exactly what this man was feeling. 

Not a long after they all started walking together and entered the cafe and each of them started taking samples from these desi pies 

The guy on the stand who was drink something I'm not really familiar with took a month of juice and then he smiled toward the group of people. What a nice young man, I think he's a philosopher.

But what made me angry the most is that the moment this young man took out a monocle from somewhere... Okay I'm not gonna lie I don't know where he pulled it looked like he pulled it straight from his ass bro 😭

Suddenly the last man standing on the stand which I regionized as the newly rising tycoon Dwayne Dantés. Suddenly froze and punched the young man before he even but on his monocle and beaten him a little with his cane.

And took make this more outrageous he took out all the Desi Pies and ran toward the carriage and ordered his servant to ride as quickly as possible. It was like a damn bank robbery.

Anyway after I helped the young man who was beaten to a crisp to get up, I told him to go to the police and report him but he suddenly froze and told me there's no need and I think that he said something while smiling I think it was "" interesting... I wonder how long it'll take for him to realize that I used his worms as ingredients""

I suddenly froze and realized I should get away from here as fast as possible.
I think they put cocaine or someshit inside these stuff.

When I was finally back home I found this monocle in my pocket I think that young man dropped.

It looks fancy I should try it.

""Hmm... Interesting"" 🧐

1pblj9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_alnuhealth/comments/1pblj9d/first_week_of_using_a_glp1_here_are_3_tips_for/,First week of using a GLP-1? Here are 3 Tips for days 1-7,"I’m a dietitian who has worked with hundreds of patients on GLP-1s, and week 1 can be a mix of excitement and nervousness, which is totally normal. If this is the first week of your GLP-1 journey, here are 3 simple actions you can do right now to set yourself up for long-term success. These tips are simple, but they make a real difference when they're done consistently.

Tip 1) Create a routine eating schedule of 3-5 eating events daily: GLP-1s decrease hunger, so it can become easier to forget to eat. Even if you don't feel hungry, your body still needs steady fuel every few hours. Pick 3 to 5 eating times, you can be consistent with most days of the week. Treat them like appointments with yourself. Use whatever  reminder system works for you such as a phone reminder, your calendar, sticky notes, or a handwritten planner. The goal is create a routine that often leads to long-term habits. This strategy helps you consistently meet nutrition needs and avoid under-eating, which can lead to feeling sluggish, side effects, and over time contributes to muscle and hair loss, and even malnutrition.

Tip 2) Start your morning with 8 to 12 oz of water: Before coffee and breakfast, have some water first. Staying well-hydrated helps prevent and improve common early side effects like nausea, constipation, and fatigue. Getting ahead of it in the morning can makes it easier to stay consistent through the day, instead of playing catch up later in the evening.

Tip 3) Use the Hunger-Fullness Scale at Least Once Daily: Think of this as a way to 'measure' your appetite. This method increases awareness and mindfulness while eating as your appetite is changing, which ultimately promotes side effect prevention and management. Rate your appetite from 1 to 10 (with 1 feeling 'starving' and 10 feeling painfully full. Ideally we want to aim between 4-7 most of the time. Not starving and not stuffed, but instead feeling mild hunger (\~4), appetite neutrality (\~5), and comfortably full (\~6-7).

Feel free to share what week 1 has felt like for you so far. If you're past your first week please share what was helpful for you during that time or any words of encouragement! ",2,1764615730.0,u_alnuhealth,0,1.0,False
1pblj3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_n_nicotine/comments/1pblj3o/day_2_of_holding_myself_accountable_from/,DAY 2 OF HOLDING MYSELF ACCOUNTABLE FROM OVEREATING,"Definitely a very snack-ish day today. I feel like I could’ve done better, but honestly my previos binge was wayyyy worse than this

Here’s what I ate today (being full honest) :

Breakfast: 1 egg, oatmeal with milk, 2 jujubes and a handful of goji berries.

Went for a workout afterwards

Post-workout
I wasn’t actually hungry but ended up snacking a lot (tbh quite mindlessly): 1 apple, 15 biscuits, 1/2 bag of popcorn , about 10 tortilla chips, 1 iced coffee with some apple juice (weirdly good comb, also refilled the apple juice into my coffee twice lol)

Lunch: 1 potato, 1 can of tomato sardines, 1 egg

Post-lunch snack: 1 square of dark chocolate

Evening snacks (again wasn't hungry too , was snacking quite mindlessly) :1/2 bag of corn chips, another 1/2 bag of popcorn (atp you can probably tell I love corn related snacks), and the rest of the apple juice from afternoon 

Dinner
I originally thought of skipping dinner since I had snacked so much, but I knew that would just lead to more snacking. So I made a proper meal:
1 bowl of rice with kimchi, and stir-fried spinach, mushrooms, broccoli, and chicken.

Usually I’d snack again after dinner, but I didn’t! I’m writing this reddit post right after dinner (a time for me to pause before reaching out for snacks) and I honestly feel full and satisfied now 

Overall, I did mindlessly snacked a lot this afternoon and evening, and that’s something I hope to improve. BUT on the positive side, I didn’t skip dinner out of guilt, and I didn’t reach for more snacks afterwards. I would say that's a small progress too !

If you’re struggling with overeating/BED, how are you doing today?
One thing I keep reminding myself is that progress doesn’t mean being perfect all day. Sometimes progress is something tiny , like pausing for a moment before a binge, even if you still end up doing it. That little pause still counts. Small steps matter.

Feel free to join me on this journey and keep each other accountable. We can do this together! 🫶",1,1764615721.0,u_n_nicotine,0,1.0,False
1pbliyu,https://v.redd.it/bjzpwfse4n4g1,The Biggest inconsistency with NFR in my opinion (Serious) (Rant),"In this clip they say that it doesn't matter if Travis Scott pens all of his verses, as long as it's ""fire"". But in the same clip, Lu says that he has a problem with that if for example Black Thought didn't pen all of his verses for The Roots albums.

In a livestream however, they said that Travis Scott isn't top 50 because he doesn't pen his verses and of his rapping ability.

Then why is Ye top 10 for both?! Right next to Black Thought??!

Not only is his rapping ability not on par with rappers like Prodigy,Jadakiss, Mos Def, DMX, J Cole, or Lupe Fiasco, but he also doesn't pen most of his own verses!

He has full teams of writers for his albums, for example The College Trilogy. Reference tracks from the past and present from Drake, Baby Keem, Cyhi The Prince and many many others.

Ant talks about Travis maybe not writing something personal as Coffee Bean, how about Kanye not writing 100% of Violent Crimes, a song dedicated to his daughter? Pardison Fontaine wrote most of those lines.

Ye is an incredible artist and would rank high purely as an artist. But not top 10 or top 15 rapper ever. No way.

You can call it glaze, maybe that's the thing but to me, be consistent on how you place others. Ye vs Black Thought isn't even a conversation.

I had severe PPD, and was put on Lexapro which is helping a lot. From when my youngest son was 3 months old until now, we had a nanny come help me with the kids which also helped a ton. First she only watched my toddler at my home, but that nanny moved so we found another (a distant family friend) who’s been with us for the last 3 months. She was with both kids for 10 hours per week. The issue is that I have a nanny cam and I saw her rough handle my toddler and discipline him in a way I never approved. Basically she yelled at him for not cleaning his plate, then pulled/dragged him to a different time out spot than we told her we use, and then pulled him to another spot. I also saw that she’s on her phone the majority of the time, and a few times we found out she drove to another town with my kids and went shopping at the Dollar Store, went on 45 minute coffee runs, and left my kids in her car while she went into her house to pick something up to bring to her teenage son at school. 

I told my husband I needed to fire her. I was scared to get rid of the only help we have. He talked to her and let her go. I’m scared of what’s to come- 5 days/week with both kids by myself.

1pblens,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pblens,Back to get more ideas,"Hi all. I was here [8 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/roomlayout/comments/1jye15s/need_help_with_an_open_living_room/) asking for ideas for my living room. I didn't have any concrete pictures of the place at the time, but now I do.

The TV (55/60) will be wall mounted onto the back wall (outlet is already there). The width of the full tv wall is 9 ft. and the length of the wall with the two bigger windows is 10.5 ft. The railing is narrower at 7 ft.

I live by myself, but I do want to have enough seating for guests (3 to 4 at most). Would a loveseat + 2 armchairs + a coffee table be viable? Thanks.",2,1764615453.0,roomlayout,0,1.0,False

I have had reflux/heartburn my whole life, IBS/gut related problems and recently got my first endoscopy that came back normal (thank goodness!). I was desperate to find answers and relief this past year after many years of having to plan my activities around what I ate. I recently made a couple of changes that have really helped me and I wanted to share them! 

My biggest piece of advice is to start small with what changes you make (if you can). I thought I had to abandon all of my favorite foods and it was emotional for me (I love food and I love cooking). But I cut out caffeinated coffee a few weeks ago and my symptoms changed drastically overnight! I drink decaf instead of regular caffeine and now have practically no reflux, hardly any gut/IBS issues, and no heartburn. If I eat trigger foods my reaction is not nearly as severe, and I don’t even need to take Pepcid much. I was shocked that the coffee could be that much of a causation because I wasn’t even drinking that much of it (I would drink half-cafe usually, and at most 2-3 shots of caffeinated espresso a day). Now I just drink decaf and my stomach issues are way less frequent. I don’t even have reflux much when I drink alcohol or eat spicy foods! 

I wanted to share this because I was absolutely terrified of making all of these big changes instantly and I’m shocked about how starting small (cutting one thing out vs. everything) has really helped me so far. I still plan to watch my trigger foods and eat them more in moderation, but I truly had no idea the lattes I was drinking every day could be causing so many issues for me. I hope this helps someone!

A sugar-free (or more accurately, “no-added-sugar”) approach can make a huge difference in your energy, cravings, and overall health without forcing you into extreme dieting.

# 🥗 What to eat on a sugar-free plan

* **Whole grains**: oats, brown rice, quinoa, whole-grain bread/pasta. 
* **Vegetables**: leafy greens, broccoli, bell peppers, tomatoes, zucchini — all great, low-sugar and fiber-rich. 
* **Whole fruits**: fruit is fine — natural sugars come with fiber, vitamins and minerals, unlike processed sweets. 
* **Lean protein & healthy fats**: like fish, chicken, eggs, legumes, nuts, seeds, olive oil — filling and nutrient-dense. 
* **Drinks and simple meals**: stick to water, unsweetened tea or coffee; simple meals or snacks with minimal processing tend to be safest.

❔❔ Did you notice any changes in energy, mood, or cravings after a few days sugar-free?

1pblcbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pblcbf/how_to_approach_a_sex_talk_with_my_girlfriend_m36/,How to approach a sex talk with my girlfriend? M36 F33,"You can read the full story for a nice gossip haha. 

I 37M have been in a relationship with my girlfriend F33 for 4 years. We have been exclusive and committed to each other. Living together for those 4 years and sharing days/weekends before. 

There's a lot of nuances for the full context so I will try to give as much as possible. 

  
I had a previous long-term relationship, started in high school, and lasted way way more than it should have. That took my whole 20s, so I didn't really experiment with other girls at that time. 

After I finished that relationship, I had a couple months of picking myself up and actually growing.

So yes, i was going out, meeting new girls, and hooking up. It was new, it was awesome, it was something i've never done before. And also it was completely brutal, something i've never done before. rejections, not knowing how to talk to girls, inexperience, ghosting. The whole dump of the not so nice side of fooling around.

Over that period, I met my current GF, we hit it off immediately, as I felt my last relationship and what I wanted in life was kind of resuming after a few months pause. She was, and is, super caring to me. Everything is good with her. I love her, and she loves me back. I can feel that every day with her actions and her overall behavior towards me. And I reciprocate that 100%. I'm caring, attentive, and responsible. 

It honestly felt like resuming after a pause, but with a new person that actually cared about me and supported me to grow in every way possible. Personally, socially, and business career wise. The whole deal. Not toxic, not a PITA.. 

  
We started to hang around more in the pandemic, where obviously, social activities were banned, and I was making the most out of it. So it also was a timing and strategic situation about it. We passed together through the lock down and pandemic. 

  
Then, we talked to make it more official. So I asked her to be my gf and all of that. At that point, i openly told her about that period of my life, and that i while reassuring my now commitment to our now exclusive relationship, i still felt inside me that I wanted to keep having sex with other girls; so I proposed we experiment threesomes, but that i understood that it might not be her likeness, so I was open to be patient about it. 

Well.. long story short, 4 years, still didn't happened. Earlier this year I mentioned her that i was feeling stuck in a couple ways. 1, our sex life has definitely decreased. 2, i had two grueling bad business years. 3, i still have that feeling inside me, but i will not act on it because i respect our relationship agreement. 

I read sometime ago that sex is a portal for good things, for blessings lets say. Not getting too deep or spiritual on it. Just that it is an important energy portal, and i believe that. 

When we started dating, obviously, sex drive, novelty, the can't keep hands out of each other, was above the roof. Of course. That was some hottt sex we had having at that time. 

That was also the time where i was killing it on the business. Selling a lot, getting commisions, money available. Vacations, new car... you name it.

In my head: lots of sex = good business  
(not just meaningful sex... i know you'll understand what i'm trying to point out here) 

But then, business collapse.

I admit my 2 bad business years had taken a toll on me, on her, on our relationship. But she stayed loyal to me, supporting however she could, and I was also loyal to her, working tirelessly to make it back again. I get it, sometimes business is not good, it is a stage, and we have to out live it. It happens, no biggies. 

Stress, ends not meeting, super short cash availability. Of course it takes a toll on a girl's libido. I get it.

So, I kept my head down. Decided to put out every desire out of me that wasn't relationship + business + house directed. I focused on working. Cut off a lot of ""friends"" which after all, not many of them actually reaches out to me now, so I guess it shows who was putting the effort on the friendships. No going out, no extra social life than whats needed. I even deleted social apps from my phone to reduce distractions. I still dont have IG on my phone, its like taking regular coca cola after you're not consuming sugar for a while.. too much.

So my social activities went to basically zero. I work remote and have a ""private"" office. So i literally spend sometimes days without interacting face to face with anyone. Putting aside the obvious of getting a coffee, store, doorman, and people like that. But friends, male or female, about 0.

I understood my task was to work and to deliver calmness and stability to my house once again. So i said to myself ""not the time to pursue other girls, since i cannot ""mantain"" the very special one that i have"". Good. Glad. 

  
Business is getting better now. I'm not splurging or anything, but i can go out to have dinner again, grab a coffee from the shop, or having a beer in the afternoon after i finish my daily work. 

I'm in an area where there is a big shopping center near me, and they have like an outdoor terrace with different food/drinks stands where a lot of people from different office buildings and tourists comes to hang out, is really cool, really nice. 

So couple weeks back, I went to have a beer. I sat alone for a while, just looking around. Then when i got to pickup a second glass, the bartender told me ""hey i saw you over there alone and looking all down.. come and sit here on the bar"" so i did, there was other people that i got to talk, and ended up having a great time. 

Then about next week, i went again with my GF this time, and had another beer.

And, last friday, i was there again, but alone bc GF had other activities, so i went to sit directly at the bar. I was there, just casually having my beer, then started to talk with other people at the bar.. and everything went well, i was having a good time. I was socializing again. 

People came by, pick up their drinks, their food.. i was making jokes with the bartender, to the people that came in and out, to the other at the bar. Then this girl comes by (of course...) so I check up and.. nice girl... but that was that. I didnt even moved from my seat. 

Then i went to pickup a bite from the stand next door, and this girl, seating at her table with her friends, when i go by she asks me ""heyy hi, you go to X gym right?"" and i told her ""yes, i do, i haven't seen you there"" chit chat, and i left her knowingly she wanted to talk more (yes ik lol)

After a while, she comes by to where I am, talked to the bartender about whatever, and approached me again to ASK FOR MY NUMBER (i was like wtf is this really happening) so i give her, she goes to her table, and when i check my phone, she has texted me already. 

A while after she comes again and says ""hey goodbye (and kisses me on the cheek), i have to go bc my friends are going but i dont really want to go home yet...."" and I was like..... hmm. Figure this is around 10pm ""so... do you want to stay here a while, and then I give you a ride home, like, is that what you're saying?"" words more, words less.. she says ""yes, i would like to stay a while and you to take me home"" 

I was like..... woah. Where are the cameras. lolllll. Yes, i did went to that place with the goal of socializing, to see and chat with people, yes with girls, but that was like what. That doesnt happen.

Well, she came, sat with me.. we chatted, hit it off.. dude, perfect. I was not simping, controlled, not just another dude drooling about how beautiful she is.

I got the car, open the door for her, and in that moment, another girl that i was talking to while waiting for my car, asks me for my IG. And when she was writing her @ tells me ""hey it seems like your girlfriend is getting jealous at me having your IG"" and I was.. fuck, yes probably (i wasnt seeing her bc the car was behind me and she was in the car already)

I got in the car and there it was. Upset (lolllllll). Tells me to get her to another bar where her friends are and to just drop her there, that she really wanted me to get her home and stuff to happen, but after me getting this other girl IG was a no for her and it really bothered her (i mean wtf, we just met, as much as the other girl but ok, i can understand)  
  
I told her ok, no problem, that i can give her a ride. No pushing, not making anything uncomfortable.. all good. I saw her smoking a cig (which I dont like) and asked if she smoked weed (i do) she told me no, but that she used to and can roll me one if I had (i was like... omg girl, why you want me to fall for you like this lollllll) ofc she rolled me one and we did a short drive around. I left her the bar she wanted, and we (cheek) kissed goodbye. We both wanted more, thats for sure, but we contained. 

Honestly, i wasnt really feeling it to go and lets say it, cheat on my girlfriend. I thought about it, of course. Mind you this is a truly beautiful girl, the one that I would approach 100%, and she approached me.

I know i kinda blow it up (maybe subconsciously or not that much) with getting the other girl's IG. But, i was honestly out to socialize. That was my friday out was about. Remember I told you I have 0 friends? well, thats why i'm working on it.

Now, guys (and gals of course) i felt awesome after that. Not gonna lie. I dont drink alcohol that much often so the kind of dizziness, the roll she made me, the approach, the talk.... you know, everything. After 4 years in a commited exclusive relationship it can feel great. It does. 

I want to see her again, 100% yes. Probably because of the high she created in me. It could have been her, or another. Is the feeling inside me. But she is beautiful tho. 

She works maybe a block away from my office, so we are in the same area, we have our numbers and everything. BUt I don't know. 

I don't want to have a ""secret"". I dont want to be keeping it hid from my girlfriend. I dont want to live with the fear of being caught. That stress is way too distracting from what i'm building at my business right now. 

But man, do i need a spice in my life. I've been dull. House-work-gym-home-sleep, for about 3 years. Not talking with any other girl. Not partying, no friends, no social life. I'm exhausted. Its a necessary period in my life, yes. I go with it, yes. But i'm tired. 

There comes sex - business balance. We have been having sex like once a week, at most. We did yesterday sunday, 15min normal, regular-ass, relationship sex. And i was like... why TF it has to be like this. We are both so tired that when we get to the bed, we just pass out. 

She has been working her ass out too, so I honestly understand her. 

I told her a couple months ago that I was feeling like a lion on a cage, pacing around, looking at preys, but contained to not do anything. I feel that in my sexual way. 

I want to talk with her again about this feeling, and proposing her we ""outsource"" our libido generation (lollll) with a girl. I need to have more sex. I honestly do. Hot steamy, animal, draining sex. I mean, i more than love our ""love making"" sex, the one with care, where we can recharge ourselves of love and energy. But also the animal one. 

And I feel her libido is not the same as before, i get it, work and life gets in the way sometimes. Tiredness comes in the way. 

So idk. How do I talk about it with her (not precisely the ""hey i was picked up by a beautiful girl the other day"") but the ""hey, i want (need) to do this, and I want to do it with you because i dont want to hurt your trust"" but i want to either get the threesome idea rolling, or (idk if that is too much) being able to talk/see other girls. I'm not looking to open the relationship tho. I don't want to change her. I just need, the thrill of the hunt, and the energy of sex. I'm like a fucking caged lion. 

And also, idk if i should write to the other girl (most likely not of course, but playing with fire is fun sometimes, don't lie about it.. lol. until you get burn, thats true)

So yea. Thats the relationship advice i'm looking for.  


TL;DR. I'm in a commited relationship with my girlfriend, but I feel bored, I need to spice up my/our sex and social life but I don't know how to approach again without hurting her feelings. ",0,1764615309.0,relationship_advice,15,0.17,False

I have a bad back, so sitting in hard chairs for a long time isn’t really an option. Unfortunately, most places I have checked out just have normal hard chair seating. I’ve also searched for this question on reddit and nobody has had the comfy seating requirement, so I figured I’d make my own post.    

Ideally I’d love to get cozy and comfortable on a couch with a cup of coffee in a relatively quiet space and just read my book I bring from home and relax for a while.   

Big plus for any explicitly queer spaces, but I figure any place like this in the city will be an accepting and safe space, so it doesn’t have to be explicitly queer.   

I’m based in Bushwick but open to traveling anywhere in the city accessible by public transit.

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

Wassup chhotu gang, So I’m 22 now, basically an old uncle in toddler terms, and I just wanted to drop some real advice before life starts hitting you with plot twists. Life genuinely gets tough, man. One day you’re chilling, drinking milk without a care in the world, and the next day you’re suddenly paying bills, stressing about work, and pretending you know what “SIP” means. It’s wild out here.

But the funny part is that toddler way of dealing with things actually works. You fall down, cry a bit, maybe throw a small tantrum so the universe knows you’re not okay, and then you just get up again like, “ha chalo, next.” That’s honestly the whole survival guide.

And yeah, sometimes life feels exactly like when someone snatches the toy you were playing with. You feel betrayed, confused, ready to fight. But you move on. You find another toy, or steal one back, balance of life and all that.

So yea... stay strong, tiny warriors. Enjoy your nap time while you still have it, because adult life has no naps, only deadlines and overpriced coffee.",4,1764614735.0,ToddlerIndia,1,1.0,False

I went with a 400W solar setup on the roof paired with a power station as my main battery.

What's working well is that the setup handles my basic needs perfectly. I can run my Maxxair fan all night, keep my laptop and phone charged, and even power my induction stove for morning coffee. The pass through charging is great too, since I can plug in at a campground and still use everything while the system recharges.

The main thing I'd change is that I underestimated my power needs for rainy periods. Last month we had four straight cloudy days where I really had to watch my usage. I'm thinking about adding a second power station or maybe upgrading to something larger down the road.

My current unit has been really reliable though, no performance issues at all. For anyone just starting out, I'd say this is a solid foundation, but definitely consider your local weather patterns when planning your capacity.",15,1764614716.0,VanLife,15,0.94,False

1pbl0ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoDependentsAnonymous/comments/1pbl0ih/do_you_ever_feel_lonely_in_the_relationship/,Do you ever feel lonely in the relationship?,"The day I left the relationship (a month ago), I had reached my limit. There was so much lying and gaslighting, quite frankly, resentment toward me for wanting answers and transparency and accountability—I just couldn’t take it anymore.

The last four weeks has been the worst time between us in our three years combined. And yes, he did end up finding a way to contact me and apologize, and asked if we could talk about the things that hurt me (like an amends conversation). As of a week later, that talk has not happened.

He seems to indicate that it’s too early to get into anything serious. It’s almost like he wants to have the loving, sweet side of things without the healing taking place. But I need the opposite. I need the truth and the real signs of change—offered transparency like not being locked out of his phone, locked out of a relationship with his mother, not being locked out of his life entirely.

I literally cannot pretend to laugh anymore. It’s not a fair ask of me.

What would true amends and change look like to me? My therapist answered it best a year ago—it’s when THEY do it on their own with no prompting, threats, or ultimatums. And if they don’t, you have to leave for your own sanity. No demands. Just accept that they aren’t ready to give you what you need, and move on.

But I know what efforts would register as real change to me:

1. Honesty and clarity given to friends whom have heard such horrible things (lies) about me FROM him that we can’t even spend time together around them. He has made it to where only he can go with people I don’t know, some I do know and they are also using, and goes to places I don’t get to know about or see. That’s unacceptable for this situation. He needs to make it right. “I lied and omitted my behavior. I put her through a lot, abusive actions and tactics, exaggerated her flaws and mistakes to garner sympathy and support, and I understand that anyone who is treated that way may not be their best self, or be nice to me or others who enable my harmful behaviors and lies. No one should be covering for me or lying for me. The main reasons I crashed after being with her was because she kept trying to make me accountable and honest, and I did not want to do so. Her anger was justified. And I want to make things right.”

2. I need him to sit down with one of our mutuals and make amends with me present. “Yes, I tried to pit you against one another because I was afraid she was going to expose the things that happened. I lied about her character, and for that, I am truly sorry.”

3. I need him to correct the damage done between his mother and I with both of us present. “Yes, I manipulated the situation to try to make you both distrust one another. My mom was telling the truth, and I didn’t want you to have access to knowing what I was doing. It was wrong to isolate you like that, and to create an environment where you were the bad guy, and you could only hear from me and no one else. Yes, that allowed me to lie a lot more easily, and I don’t want to be this way anymore. You deserve truth and transparency.”

4. I need to see HIM control his own participation around parties and alcohol and being around other active drug users. “I want sobriety, and if my friends do not support that, they will no longer be my friends. I do not WANT to be around coke usage, people getting trashed on the weekends, or with people who have not stopped using or heavily drinking.”

5. I need to see self control and accountability. “Yes, I cheated on you many times throughout the relationship in a variety of ways. I realize this caused massive distrust and pain. Yes, I also did meet up with people, and went to that hotel, and since then, have exposed you to STDs. I will pay for your testing, and I will block and delete every single contact and app and account I’ve used to disrespect our relationship in this way. And I am seeking help for this impulsive behavior. You also have access to my phone and location at any time. And my friends all know that if anyone tried to convince me to be unfaithful, or to pursue risky impulsive sex, or had covered for my actions, then they are not supporting my mental health, my relationship, and my growth as a man.”

6. Gaslighting: “Yes, I realize now how mentally damaging it was to try to convince you that others were lying, and that your own mind was lying to you when I was actually doing the things you heard or suspected me of doing. I realize that level of manipulation caused you incredible distress and damage mentally. I know it will take a LONG time to rebuild trust, and you have every right not to believe my words. So, I will show you with my actions.”

7. Therapy: “I realize I have displayed concerning, emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive behavior, and that I need help. I will take you with me to my therapist so you know for sure that I am determined to get help to change these things.”

8. Drugs: “Yes, I misuse Xanax, Kratom, pot, alcohol, etc. I have not been truly sober, and I’m starting now by taking you with me to my doctor to get started on real sobriety. No more self medicating.”

He used to write me letters after something bad happened. Sometimes on paper. Sometimes in text. But there was always this big apology and acknowledging what he did, and promises to change and what steps he was taking. But now, it’s this general, “We’re just working on ourselves. In the meantime, let’s be sweet and supportive.”

I feel like I got reeled back to the day we broke up, where he said he wanted to just blanket trust each other, not discuss anything that has happened, and to have no more “relationship rules.” That’s when I left him. And somehow, we’re right back here, now with the arrangement he wanted. And all I feel is loneliness.

The same loneliness that plagued me these that three years. Because it’s not like a normal relationship! There’s no future goals we’re working toward together. No expectations. No shared friends, no activities in groups anymore, no dates. We have to hide me away from his mother and friends. It’s AWFUL. This is not normal. What future is there with all of this broken stuff?

We have completely separate lives. Yes, I find comfort in my friends and children. I go do things that make me happy. But I have spent the last five years total without a healthy partner. And with us so far away now from becoming a normal, healthy couple with shared lives, I don’t even know what do to anymore. The kind of relationship I want is now seemingly further away than ever. 

It’s either serious healing of the damage done, or I am going to truly move on. I have waited SO long, hung on so damn long. I KNOW what I want and what I don’t want. And I honestly feel like I’m still compromising that based on a “Be patient. We’ll get there,” promise. But like? I’ve been divorced five years, in this codependent relationship for over three of those five years. My will to wait for something to change that may or may not happen is at about 10%. 

I hardly cry about it anymore. I feel numb. I daydream about a life where me and my partner get up every morning and make coffee. He runs to the store while I do the laundry. We invite friends over for dinner. We watch a movie with the kids, then he and I play music and video games and work on our own projects. We buy a home together and plan vacations. We sit outside on summer nights and grill food and dance. 

We only want each other. We write little notes and help take care of each other. We’re solid. We go to church. We pray together. We spend time with each other’s family and get excited about holidays. We go sledding, and swimming, and karaoke, and walk trails, and plant flowers, and cook together.

That’s not a daydream. It’s just a description of a healthy life with another person. No more nightmares. No more shaking. No more Xanax. Because there’s no need for it. ",2,1764614610.0,CoDependentsAnonymous,0,1.0,False

# Running Art Exhibits



[**Art Exhibit — The Disobedient Ones**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-the-disobedient-ones/) at **Frederic Jameson Gallery, Friedl Bldg**

* Cornelio Campos and Rodrigo Dorfman, two consolidated visual Latino artists living in North Carolina, come together for their first collaborative exhibit. The exhibit will also feature a forum about art and mobility, guided tours, and a film screening as part of the 2025 North Carolina Latin American Film Festival.
* Campos and Dorfman will be exhibiting new paintings created at the intersection of emerging AI technologies and the ongoing challenges of bearing witness to the (im)migrant Latino experience in the Nuevo South. The Disobedient Ones/Los Desobedientes is an attempt to break the rules, challenge assumptions, and search for new definitions of our humanity in a world whose axis and paradigms appear to be disintegrating before our eyes.
* On view Weekdays 9 a.m.-6 p.m.
* Cornelio Campos is a self-trained painter and muralist from Mexico who has resided in Durham, North Carolina, since 1990. His paintings and murals reflect on his indigenous Purépecha roots and his immigrant experience in the United States. Campos has exhibited throughout North Carolina, Colombia, Italy, and Mexico, and his work is part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian’s Anacostia Museum. He is the first Latino to receive a North Carolina Heritage Award.
* Opening: September 20, 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM Film Screening: October 4, 6:00 PM Forum: October 11 and 12 (TBA) Guided Tour: November 7th (TBA) Closing Party: December 12. 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM
* September 29- December 12

[**Art Exhibit — Sherman Fleming: Unsettled**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-sherman-fleming-unsettled/) at **Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University**

* Known for his provocative performances, Sherman Fleming (b. 1953), is an influential multimedia artist based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This focused survey gathers works spanning forty years of Fleming’s career, presenting paintings, drawings, ephemera, and documentation of his performances made between 1978–2019.
* Fleming’s works are demonstrations of perseverance, self-control, and conviction. The artist’s main medium is his body, which he uses in myriad ways. His endurance performances span hours and even months and include walking through Philadelphia for a day while carrying an eight-foot-tall wooden phallus along with spending a year wearing a noose—objects purposely chosen as material reminders of racial and sexual stereotypes of Black masculinity as well as the ongoing trauma of racialized terrorism in the United States.
* The unsettling nature of his work pushes the boundaries of discomfort as the imagery features both difficult subjects and unresolved compositions. Overall, Fleming’s complex practice is connected through his relentless processes that consistently expand the horizons of what art can be and how it may be experienced on paper, canvas, in a gallery, in a theatre, or even live on the street. Through his innovative explorations of identity, the artist’s messaging continues to resonate in profound ways, many years after its making.
* Tu-Sa 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Su 12-5 p.m.
* September 29- January 18

[**Art Exhibition — Human Landscapes, the Mystery of the Mark**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/human-landscapes-the-mystery-of-the-mark/) at **NCCU Art Museum**

* North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the Eric Kelly Museum are proud to announce a major exhibition celebrating the extraordinary work of NCCU alumnus Dr. Eric A.W. Kelly III, founder of the Kelly Worldwide advertising and marketing Agency and Director of Eric Kelly III Museum, and one of the most transformative abstract expressive artists of our time. Running from October 23, 2025, through January 4, 2026, the exhibition, Human Landscapes: The Mystery of the mark, presents a groundbreaking fusion of color, sound, and emotional storytelling through more than 50 paintings spanning seven decades of artistic mastery. In this groundbreaking exhibit, Dr. Kelly will be showing some of his early masterpieces from his days at NCCU, leading up to his present style called neo-abstract expressive.
* Dr. Eric Kelly III’s visionary style—marked by bold black lines, synesthetic color experiences, and deeply expressive portraiture—has shaped a new visual language that bridges abstraction and identity. A 1982 graduate of NCCU’s Visual Communications program and the university’s first Art Scholarship recipient, Dr. Kelly returns to his alma mater to debut a multisensory journey that explores the human condition through dynamic compositions, vivid colors, original music scores, and shares his new movie documentary “Human Landscapes” during the exhibition.
* This event is free and open to the public. RSVP FOR ART TOURS 919-308-9090
* October 22- January 4

I’m kinda newish to the moka world and this is my first post.

A few weeks ago I decided to change the funnel on my 6-cup sized bialetti moka pot.

Problem is, even though I bought an official replacement funnel from Bialetti with the correct measurements, the new one has significant issues.

When I brew, waters starts leaking sideways, and the coffee flow at the top becomes very slow, to the point that some of the water simply doesn’t move upwards.

In the ending, I am losing 50 + % liquid on the process, from leaking and from water just not traveling upwards.

Do you guys know if there is anything I should try before contacting Bialetti for a replacement?

Many of you battle with anxiety for years and don't know what else to do, to try. To learn from others that have to or had to go through the same things might often be an important step of how to deal with anxiety and to be able to try out what worked for others. So I share my story here too, and hopefully it will help or bring some new ideas to some of you.

\--------------------------------

Battled over 15 years with anxiety till I got it under control. Full control.

After fighting it by learning how to dive, skydive, shooting guns & bows, going to the gym, meditation, throwing myself into life and parties in the hope this is a psychological thing, a doctor in South Africa helped me on the right track (they are amazing with anything about the immune system).

Here's what helped me:

**1. Antihistamines**. But only very specific ones. Anything containing ""Desloratadine"" or ""Loratadine"". It's the only medicament I take now. 1 pill a day. Sometimes 1 every 2 days. Nothing else. No other Antihistamine works at all.

If you feel as if ants walk over your body at times, just slightly even, give this a go. Try it. If it helps, you will know 30 minutes after taking one pill. (Also if you feel kind of irritated and with bad thoughts and you feel at the same time like they have no basis in reality)

**2. Food.** The best, most simple test you can do is to do a 5 day fasting. No food at all, only light soup if you have to, and lots and lots of water. If you feel better after day 3 and you feel like your anxiety is gone, then food is your problem. Food has a huge impact on anxiety.

\---------------

If fasting makes it better you'll have a journey ahead to figure out what helps for you specifically, but here's a few universal ones

Coffee, Tea, Cola - Caffeine is a no go. Avoid at all costs. Whatever the source of your anxiety, anything that triggers your nervous system into overload is poison.

Processed foods - Snack bars, candy, chips, microwaves oversalty/sugary/fatty food, sugar drinks. Avoid anything processed. That includes bread.

Fruits, Vegetables - Eat and cook simple food with simple recipes. Have fresh vegetables and fruits, fresh herbs, simple spices. Go for quinoa over rice, for rice over pasta.

Change your diet long term, your gut health improves, your anxiety lowers a lot.

A bit of sports helps, but food is the key for I'd say most cases that come from the physical side.",1,1764614475.0,Anxiety_and_food,0,1.0,False

It’s like when it’s someone new texting me i can’t tell if they’re texting me to make fun of me or something idk. I can’t put it into words that make sense,but it is a pretty irrational fear. 
If i know someone for a while and text them daily that fear isn’t present (like idk let’s say my mother,sister,boyfriend for an example),but if my contact cuts down with someone making new contact scares the shit out of me and i don’t know whyyyyyy,i genuinely have no idea
I know the best thing to do is to just try to get out of my shell,but fuck it’s hard. ",3,1764614204.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False
1pbkt5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pbkt5d/got_a_scary_bp_reading_at_the_pharmacy_could/,"Got a scary BP reading at the pharmacy, could anxiety be the cause?","Context: I have OCD, and one of my main themes is health-related anxiety. I had to get a blood pressure test due to wanting to start a medication for another mental health problem. Male in low 20s, 190cm and around 72ish KG. I don't smoke anymore, but I do use nicotine pouches, although I had taken one out about an hour before the test. I had a coffee in the morning (test was at 4 pm) and hadn't eaten lots (a banana in the morning, and two sausage rolls for lunch). Didn't need to pee during the test. Had a few drinks the day before, maybe 4 pints total, spread from 5-10 in the evening (wouldn't say I was hungover whatsoever).

 I went to a local pharmacy to get my blood pressure tested. It's about a 15-minute walk with an average walking pace, and I went inside and asked about a test, and they asked me to wait for the current appointment to end. After about 5 minutes, I was let inside the small room, and a woman sat me down and asked me a few basic questions about my age and address, etc. She then put the cuff on my arm, and we waited. I noticed my heart rate was at 125 bpm sitting, when it is usually around 70 bpm when relaxed in bed. I was shaking slightly and definitely quite anxious, as I had been worrying that I have high blood pressure (for no reason whatsoever, no symptoms, etc). Anyway, the readings showed up at 170/89 on average. She proceeded to do more tests with probably a 30-second gap in between tests (can't exactly remember, as I was clouded with anxiety).

Is there any medical basis for hypertension based on these readings, or are they completely useless given the anxiety?

1pbkt46,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1pbkt46/what_smart_plug_is_compatible_with_google_home/,What smart plug is compatible with Google Home?,"If you're looking to make your home smarter, getting a **smart plug that works with Google Home** is a great starting point. These little devices let you control almost any appliance with just your voice, and they're super easy to set up.

## What Makes a Smart Plug Compatible?

For a **smart plug** to work with Google Home, it needs to support Google Assistant integration. Most major brands nowadays are built with this feature, so you've got plenty of options. You'll want to look for plugs that connect through Wi-Fi and can be added to the Google Home app without any weird workarounds.

## Top Features to Look For

When shopping for a **Google Home compatible smart plug**, here are the basics you should check:

**Wi-Fi connectivity** is essential - most plugs work on 2.4GHz networks, which is pretty standard for home routers. You don't want to deal with extra hubs or bridges if you don't have to.

**Voice control capability** lets you turn devices on and off by talking to your Google Assistant. This works through any Google Home speaker or your phone.

**Scheduling features** mean you can set timers and routines. Want your coffee maker to start brewing before you wake up? Done.

**Energy monitoring** is a bonus feature on some models. It shows you how much electricity your devices are using, which can help lower your bills.

## Setting Things Up

Getting your **smart plug** connected to Google Home is pretty straightforward. You plug it into an outlet, download the manufacturer's app, connect it to your Wi-Fi, and then link it through the Google Home app. The whole process usually takes less than ten minutes.

Once it's connected, you can create custom voice commands and add the plug to routines. You can group multiple plugs together too, so saying ""Hey Google, turn off the living room"" can control several devices at once.

## Where to Find Quality Options

You'll find plenty of **smart plugs compatible with Google Home** available online. [Check out these compatible smart plugs](https://athomewave.com/smart-plug) to see what's currently popular and well-rated. The selection includes different sizes, features, and price points to match what you need.

## Making Your Choice

Think about what you'll actually use it for. If you're just controlling a lamp or fan, a basic model works fine. Need to control something that uses more power like a space heater? Make sure the plug can handle the wattage.

Compact designs are better if your outlets are in tight spaces. Some plugs are bulky and block both outlets, which can be annoying.

Reading reviews helps you avoid duds. Look for mentions of connection stability since some cheaper plugs lose their Wi-Fi connection randomly.

## Final Thoughts

**Smart plugs** are one of the easiest and cheapest ways to start building a smart home. They work with devices you already own, and the Google Home integration means you don't need to learn anything complicated.

Whether you want to control lights, fans, holiday decorations, or small appliances, a compatible smart plug gets the job done.

Delonghi refused to replace the unit. Multiple failures with the milk frother, months of back-and-forth, “repairs” that didn’t fix anything, and Delonghi still refuses to acknowledge it’s a faulty machine.

I'm coming up on one year of owning a Delonghi Eletta Explore coffee machine and wanted to write a full review of my experience.

I purchased the Eletta Explore last November (2024) and the machine came with a cracked water tank. The box is extremely well padded, so it must have been dropped hard for the tank to crack through the padding. I asked Delonghi to replace the entire unit since I couldn't tell if there was internal damage. They refused and only sent a replacement tank, which didn’t even have the trim installed.

Fast forward a few months (\~8 months of actual use) and the milk frother stopped working. It wouldn’t dispense any hot milk from the carafe. I contacted Delonghi again and they repeated the same script:  
“Clean the carafe and try again.”

After contacting them 2–3 times, they finally sent a replacement carafe… which did not fix the issue.

I contacted them again, and they made me clean the new carafe, they just sent, on video and try again. When that didn’t work, they finally agreed to take the unit in for **“repairs.”**  
I put repairs in quotes because the repair sheet they returned with the machine showed they basically just ran a few tests and sent it back.

After this “repair,” the machine dispensed some milk, but noticeably less than when it was new. I assumed the issue was resolved and continued using it.

Meanwhile, the entire process, from the first support call to getting the machine back, took over two months, leaving me without a working machine for that time.

Not even a month after getting the machine back, the frother failed again. No milk dispensing. Same issue.

I contacted Delonghi yet again, and it’s almost like they have zero visibility into my account history. They immediately restarted the same troubleshooting loop:  
“Clean the milk carafe and try again.”

It's been almost a week and they’re still giving me the runaround and still refusing to replace the clearly defective unit.

I hope my experience helps someone make an educated purchase decision. With Black Friday deals still going, buying a $2,000 machine for $1,500 might sound enticing. On paper, the machine seems great, but **if something goes wrong, you will be stuck with a faulty machine.** The support experience has been terrible.

I'll update this post if Delonghi ever resolves the issue. But as of now, I’ve owned the machine for almost a year but have only been able to use it **for about 8 months total**. The rest of the time was spent troubleshooting or waiting for “repairs.”

Are you thinking about moving to Charlotte NC from NYC? You are not alone. Every year thousands of New Yorkers head south in search of more space, lower costs, a warmer climate, and a balanced lifestyle that still offers big city energy. As someone who helps people relocate to Charlotte every day, I see exactly what surprises New Yorkers, what they love, and what they wish they knew earlier.

This guide breaks everything down with real insights from the Charlotte market, a cost comparison, top neighborhoods, transportation tips, and answers to the questions people always ask before relocating. It is structured for easy scanning and optimized for featured snippets so you can find exactly what you need.



# Why So Many New Yorkers Are Moving to Charlotte

Charlotte feels like a natural fit for someone coming from New York. It is a fast growing city with a booming job market, a strong finance and tech presence, and a food and culture scene that keeps expanding. What makes Charlotte especially attractive is the ability to enjoy a big city lifestyle with far fewer tradeoffs.

**Top reasons people make the move**

* More affordable apartments and homes
* Lower taxes and a friendlier cost of living
* Larger floor plans and modern amenities
* A strong job market with career growth
* Mild winters and plenty of sunshine
* A balance of city energy and suburban comfort
* Easy access to beaches, mountains, and weekend trips  

# Cost of Living Comparison

# Charlotte vs New York City

The difference is huge. If you are moving to Charlotte NC from NYC, the first shock is how much more you get for your money.

# Housing Costs

**Charlotte Average Rent**

* One bedroom: $1450 to $1700
* Two bedroom: $1700 to $2100
* Three bedroom: $2100 to $2600  

**NYC Average Rent**

* One bedroom: $3300 to $4200
* Two bedroom: $4300 to $6000
* Three bedroom: $6000+   

Most New Yorkers cut their rent by 30 to 60 percent just by moving to Charlotte. You also get in-unit laundry in almost every modern building, something New Yorkers treat like a luxury.

# Everyday Expenses

Groceries, dining out, and services are noticeably cheaper. You can grab coffee for four dollars instead of seven. A night out is twenty percent to forty percent less. Parking is often free. Car insurance is lower. You do not pay New York City income tax. Your money simply goes further in almost every category.



# Best Neighborhoods in Charlotte for New Yorkers

Charlotte has walkable pockets, urban style communities with tons of apartments, and quieter areas with more space. Here are the neighborhoods New Yorkers ask about the most.

# South End

The closest thing Charlotte has to a true NYC vibe. Modern apartments, trendy restaurants, breweries, coffee shops, gyms, light rail access, and constant activity. Great for people in their twenties and thirties who want a lively area.

# NoDa

Charlotte’s arts district. Colorful murals, music venues, unique restaurants, and a strong creative community. Walkable and fun with a very different personality from Manhattan or Brooklyn but just as charming.

# Plaza Midwood

Hip, eclectic, and filled with local bars, vintage shops, and an overall relaxed feel. This is where many Brooklyn and Queens transplants land.

# Uptown

Charlotte’s version of downtown. High rise living, walkable restaurants, corporate towers, sports arenas, and quick access to the light rail. Ideal for banking and tech professionals.

# University City

More spacious with lower rent and tons of modern apartment communities. Close to UNC Charlotte and a popular choice for renters looking for affordability without sacrificing quality.

# SouthPark

A luxury suburban city center with high end shopping, restaurants, and beautiful apartment communities. Think of it as Charlotte’s polished and upscale district.



# What New Yorkers Should Expect

# The Pace

Charlotte is fast growing but the pace of life is calmer than New York. You can breathe here. You can drive places without losing your entire day. You do not have to plan a week ahead just to grab dinner with friends.

# Transportation

Most people drive. Public transportation exists and the light rail is great for South End to Uptown, but Charlotte is still car dependent. You will want a car once you settle in.

# Weather

Winters are mild. Summers are warm and humid. Spring and fall are incredible. You get all four seasons without the extremes.

# Job Market

Charlotte is home to major banks, healthcare systems, tech companies, engineering firms, energy companies, logistics, and growing creative industries. Many New Yorkers find the job market surprisingly strong.



# Moving Costs

# NYC to Charlotte

Most long distance moves from NYC to Charlotte range from **2,500 to 6,000**, depending on:

* Size of your apartment
* Distance and route
* Time of year
* Packing services
* Flexibility with moving dates  

People with only a studio or one bedroom often save money by renting a truck or shipping belongings in batches. Larger moves usually require a full service moving company.

# FAQs About Moving to Charlotte from NYC

# Is Charlotte cheaper than NYC?

Yes, significantly. Rent, dining, transportation, taxes, and daily expenses all drop.

# Is Charlotte a good place for young professionals?

Absolutely. The city is filled with restaurants, gyms, bars, walkable pockets, and career opportunities.

# Do I need a car in Charlotte?

Eventually yes. Many people start without one, especially in South End or Uptown, but long term life is easier with a vehicle.

# How long does it take to feel settled?

Most New Yorkers say it takes about three to six months. Once you know the neighborhoods and establish your routine, Charlotte feels like home.

# What are the biggest surprises for New Yorkers?

How friendly people are, how clean the city is, and how easy daily life becomes.



# Final Thoughts

Moving to Charlotte NC from NYC can be one of the best lifestyle upgrades you make. You get a modern, fast growing city with incredible food, warm weather, more space, and a cost of living that gives you your life back.

If you want help finding an apartment or exploring neighborhoods, you can reach out anytime. I live here, create content about the city every day, and help people relocate smoothly. Charlotte has a lot to offer and I can help make your move easier.

	•	I go to sleep perfectly fine, no headache.
	•	I wake up in the morning with a headache.
	•	Around 8 AM I have breakfast + coffee → headache goes away.

But here’s the problem:

I have gastric issues. I end up needing to use the washroom before and after breakfast, so my stomach feels totally empty. Because of that, I start feeling hungry again by 10:30 AM, and the hunger itself gives me another headache.

Then the cycle repeats:
	•	I eat something before lunch → headache
	•	I drink coffee → headache settles
	•	I eat lunch at 1 PM → boom, another headache
	•	This time coffee doesn’t fully help
	•	Snacks at 4 PM → headache
	•	Coffee again → partial relief
	•	Dinner → if the lunchtime headache didn’t fully go away, it usually stays through the evening or night

So basically, I’m stuck in this loop:
Eat → headache → coffee → relief (sometimes) → stomach empties → hunger → headache all over again.

It’s super frustrating, and it’s happening every single day.

Has anyone else gone through this combination of morning headaches, hunger headaches, gastric issues, and caffeine dependence?
How did you fix it?

6.

 

The group arrived back in The Realm seeking guidance from Auntie Cici and Unc for how to find the missing Knight. “I find that when you lose something, it’s best to retrace your steps. Here’s a list of the typical things JJ does working as an active December Knight.” Auntie Cici provided the team with a list of tasks that JJ hadn’t started yet. 25 items to be exact.

“He does all this every year?” Akari-Maria expressed with disbelief. The rest of the team gathered around her and their eyes widened once they saw the list. Despite the heavy lifting the list would take to complete, the December Knights accepted the mission and began their journey.

Their first stop was to travel to Ethiopia and collect a specific tea and bring it to an old man living in a senior citizen community in Florida. The old man is unable to travel and cannot order the tea, but this tea is something that he used to share with his daughter on her birthday, December 19th. Unfortunately, she passed a few years back, but the pain hurts all the same. JJ would bring the tea and have a cup with him, listening to him share the same story about his daughter. The December Knights completed this task with great honor.

The seventh item on the list was to help a farmer family with their crops. The family would lose their usual help due to the holiday season. But JJ, with the help of his magic horse, helped pick up where the family needed it most. The team did the same.

Number twelve on their list was visiting an animal shelter and letting the animals out to play with; especially the ones who were not adopted for gifts. 

On fourteen, the December Knights made their way to Danny’s Home, a group home started and run by Danny, the little boy JJ helped on his first night as a Christmas spirit. Their task was to travel to the nursery area and put on a funny Christmas show. 

With the Knights rounding out the list, number 20 reunited the group with a couple of old friends. Eddie the Yeti and Sasha Sasquatch were waiting for JJ to compete in their annual ping pong tournament. They were pleasantly surprised when the others showed up. They played for quite some time and the cousins decided to join the team just so they didn’t miss out on seeing JJ for the year. 

Prior to completing the list, the Knights never noticed they couldn’t read number 25, but when the 24th task was complete, the 25th appeared clear as day. *‘Grant the final wish and guide them to the After Realm.’*

Confused, the team looked at each other, wondering what it fully meant, as there were no other instructions. Eddie and Sasha then explained what the After Realm was. And the December Knights found themselves back in the palace. A green staff with a glowing gold orb at the top of it appeared before each of the older December Knights’ doorways. They took it and were instantly transported to different locations.

Tina was placed in a room with an older woman trying to get her phone to work to say her final goodbyes to her grandson. Tina raised her staff and the orb glowed, insinuating this made the phone work. She listened as the family expressed their love for each other. Then her orb dimmed a little, and the woman closed her eyes for the final time.

Akari-Maria found herself in a war stricken neighborhood. She heard the cries of a mother and child calling for each other. She raised her staff, and the family had heard one another and found each other. They hugged and cried in each other’s arms. Akari-Maria looked on as a flash of light overtook the street. When the smoke cleared, only she was left. Her orb dimmed and so did the light in her eyes.

Max was in front of a house. Confused by where he was until his orb lit up and he heard a child calling for him. The child asked if he knew where his father was. Normally his dad would play catch with him at this time, but he was stuck in traffic. Max raised his orb and the father came home within seconds. The two went to the backyard to play catch for about 30 minutes. The father carried his son up to his room and laid him on his bed. He kissed his son’s forehead and left to answer a fire call. As he pulled out of his driveway and drove closer towards the blazing fire, Max’s orb dimmed.

The Knights made it back to The Realm, all a little somber but also with a new respect for what JJ does each and every year. They explained what happened to Sada and the cousins. “I’m so happy that they were able to spend their final moments happy, but I still feel so sad for them.” Eddie and Sasha went to console Sada. “I wish I knew how JJ does this each year. His heart must really be made of gold.” When Sada went to rub her eyes, she noticed she too now had a staff with a glowing orb on it in front of her doorway, smaller than the others but powerful nonetheless. She raised it and the others instinctively grabbed onto each other.

The December Knights, along with the cousins, were transported right outside the children’s hospital that JJ and Kenny had fought in front of so many years ago. The Knights were there for the apologies between JJ and Kenny. They watched on as JJ entered the hospital and made his way towards one of the rooms. 

“Hey Kiara! You’re never gonna believe it, that big dope and I actually made up and became friends.” JJ said as he took his jacket off and threw it into a hospital chair. They performed their secret handshake, showing off their matching watches.

“Thank God! If you kept messing with him, you’d probably end up here.” A little girl said as she coughed.

“That wouldn’t be so bad. At least we’d get to hang out more.” JJ smiled. 

“Yeah, but you’d get to go home after a little while.” Kiara said.

“Have the doctors said how much longer you have here?” JJ asked. 

“They said I can leave once I get a new heart. But that could take another week or month or never.” Kiara answered.

“What’s the hold up?!” JJ responded with bass in his voice.

“Finding a heart that fits me isn’t easy.” Kiara sniffled.

“I know. I’m sorry, I’m just so mad. This idiot drank and drove and walked away fine and now…” JJ stopped himself from finishing his statement. “How about this, you’re going to get a new heart and in 25 years we’re going to go on a Christmas vacation to celebrate!”

“JJ, it’s okay. You don’t have to say that to be nice. I already spoke with my mom. I’m not that afraid of dying.” Kiara said as tears welled up.

JJ walked over and held Kiara’s hand. “Kiara, I promise you, we are going to take that vacation to some tropical island.” JJ and Kiara were both tearing now. 

“Fine. But why do we have to wait 25 years from now?” said Kiara, wiping her eyes.

“We’ll be 35 by then. I can’t afford a trip to the Bahamas on a ten year old’s salary.” The two friends both laughed and put on the television. The Christmas episode of Living Single was playing. JJ performed the Christmas song the tv friends sang, making Kiara crack up even more. “Christmas is the best season. Not only for the gifts and lights but also because of the miracles. You’ll see in 25 years!”

The December Knights returned to The Realm. The only sound that filled the air was the sniffles from each and every one of them. It had been awhile before anyone said anything. 

“JJ was going through all of that the week we met?” Max cried.

“I never would’ve guessed it.” Akari-Maria followed with. 

“I don’t think anyone could’ve seen that. He’s always so happy.” said Tina.

“No wonder he’s been out of it recently. This year is 25 years after that day.” Sada spoke with gloom.

“Do you think he ended up going to that island to mourn Kiara? You know, to pay homage to his promise.” Max asked.

“Without a doubt. That would be the most JJ thing to do.” Tina answered.

“I think we should go too. At least to give him a little comfort. We don’t have to stay there for a long time. But just enough to show him how much we love him and to help take off some of that burden.” Akari-Maria suggested.

“You guys were there for me when I lost my granddad. It helped a lot. I say we do it.” Max added.

“If you’re going, we’re going too.” Sasha said.

“The question is, how do we find out what island he went to?” Tina posed. 

A light went on in front of JJ’s doorway. “I think we got our answer!” Sada exclaimed. 

The December Knights walked through JJ’s doorway with a little more hope than they had only a few moments ago. They were transported to a beautiful tropical island. The weather was perfectly balanced, a lovely heat and a generous breeze. Waves were crashing ever so playfully on the shore. Families were playing together and one could hear a soft melody of island tunes off in the background. 

The team scanned their surroundings and saw a familiar figure, sitting on a beach bench staring out into the ocean. They all rushed over in excitement. They hadn’t noticed, but their once lovely winter wardrobe had been changed into the perfect beach outfit. 

“JJ!” They all shouted.

JJ quickly turned around. “Knights? What in the world are y’all doing here?” he said as he recognized his old friends.

Eddie and Sasha both picked JJ up and tossed him back and forth. “Hey hey! Put me down Hairy Berry and Fur Sinatra!” JJ shouted. “I forget how strong y’all fur balls are.”

“We’re just so happy to see you! You didn’t come to play ping pong with us and we got worried.” Sasha said.

“I know I’m sorry about that. I was planning to do the list tomorrow. I just…” said JJ.

“No need to apologize, we know everything.” Eddie added.

“You do?” JJ questioned.

“We do. And we’re so sorry for not being there for you for all those years.” Tina chimed in.

“Life got busy but that’s no excuse, especially after doing your list tonight. Our friend needed us and we promise to never leave you hanging again. With all the work you do, you’re going to need a day dedicated to you.” Max said with a smile.

“JJ, you bring so much joy to the world. I can’t believe we couldn’t see that. You are so appreciated and we want to make sure you know it.” Akari-Maria added.

“Wow guys, you’re going to make me cry. Thanks for taking care of the list too. I would’ve got to it, but I just needed to do this first.” JJ said through grinning teeth.

“No, no. We should’ve been helping out regardless. You need time to yourself.” Tina said. “We know about Kiara and no one should have to go through that alone. We came to give you some company while you grieve but we’ll of course accept that you need time alone. Just let us know.”

“How’d you find out about Kiara?” JJ asked.

“It started with me sir. My name is Sada. I came to visit Roosevelt and was worried when you didn’t show up for a few nights. I followed you around and ended up with these guys. After the 25th task on the list, we ended up in one of your memories. The one where you and Kiara made that promise.” Sada answered.

“Well thank you for caring about me, young lady. And thank y’all for coming to find me in my time of need. It’s really nice to see y’all after all these years. I’m truly honored by all the love.” JJ said as he hugged the entire group.

“Umm JJ. Are you okay?” A woman said from behind the hugging group.

“Kiara! My baby, these are my people. Come meet them.” JJ said with a smirk.

“Huh???” The group said in unison.

“Everyone, this is my lovely wife Kiara Zora Baldwin!” JJ smiled.

“But in the memory...” Akari-Maria mumbled.

“Let’s just say Christmas miracles do happen. They found a heart for Kiara, and she had her transplant on Christmas Eve of that year.” JJ gave a kiss to Kiara on the cheek.

“But you looked so sad in the city at all those coffee shops, and you missed those events,” said Sada.

“City? You were there?” Sada nodded yes. “Uh, little girl, please don’t ever follow no grown man into the city again. The sentiment was cute, but people are still crazy. And you’re correct, I was sad. My watch stopped working, I went there to try some shops to fix it.” JJ followed up with.

“You skipped those days to get a watch fixed?!” Sada questioned.

“It’s not just any watch, it’s a collectible Digimon watch.” JJ said, putting his and Kiara’s arms up to show the matching set. “We saved up so much money to buy these for each other when we were like 7.”

“I’m not understanding. Couldn’t you get the watch fixed at another time?” Sada followed up with.

“Absolutely. But fixing it at that time was more of a metaphor. Choosing to do something that made me happy rather than adhering to a set forth social norm; you know like working for someone else’s happiness instead of my own. Don’t get me wrong, I really love the celebration, but this was more important to me. Besides, the celebration is two weeks long, we’ll be back before it ends.” JJ smiled at Sada and patted her on the head. “I wouldn’t think too much into it. Because it sounds like two certain psychological and social constructs put a plan in motion to deceive you and these other chuckle heads into chasing a false lead to rekindle the meaning of Christmas. Which of course is…”

“Christmas lights!” The others said in harmony, interrupting JJ.

“Annnnnnd silly little Christmas stories that are meant to make you feel good and not take life too seriously. It happens to the best of us.” 

“Guilty!” Auntie Cici and Unc said, materializing out of the blue. The group all laughed and hugged each other.

“Now that we got all the existential and meta commentary out of the way, you have got to be kidding me cuz! You got married! Congratulations!” Max said with a hug.

“Thanks! I didn’t tell you guys because it was a small wedding and we hadn’t spoken in some years.” JJ said.

“No need to apologize. I think we realized we’ve fallen off as friends and that needs to change!” Tina said. “Kiara, I am honored to meet you! My name is…”

“Hold on, let me guess Tina, Akari-Maria, Max, Sasha and Eddie?” Kiara asked. “JJ told me all about your adventures. I didn’t believe him at first but he had proof.”

“Spot on!” Max answered.

“She can see us?” Eddie asked.

“And hear you too!” JJ said, holding out his staff.

“Well now that everyone’s here, we can get the party started!” Auntie Cici said. “I’ve been waiting so long for this!” Unc followed up with. 

All together again, the December Knights, including Kiara, Sasha and Eddie all had a wondrous evening. Tina showed everyone how to surf. Max and the cousins gorged themselves on seafood. Akari-Maria and Kiara built the biggest sandcastle and JJ and Sada worked on improving the Holiday Spirits Celebration. Their night ended with a bonfire and reminiscing. JJ asked them about how they felt after completing each task on the list. They all talked about how much joy they felt but avoided the 25th task. JJ specifically brought it up and the group mentioned how bittersweet it was. JJ inquired and they spoke of the beautiful tragedy of watching someone’s last moments but said it was difficult when their orbs went out.

“Yeah, your orbs were supposed to go out, and your wings were supposed to open up so that you can guide them to the After Realm, the place beyond their dreams, back to the perfect reality. You’re telling me you guys just left after that?!” JJ imposed. 

“We didn’t know that! Sasha and Eddie said the After Realm was the afterlife.” Tina answered.

“No, no, no, noooo. Eddie and Sasha, where’d you get a bright idea like that?” JJ asked.

“What do you mean? That’s how you explained it to us five years ago.” Eddie said.

“Yes, I explained the afterlife and the After Realm! I was telling you the difference!” JJ expressed.

“After Realm, afterlife, it all sounds the same to me.” Eddie yelled back.

“Guys, this is why I shared those books with you. You need to brush up on your human knowledge.” JJ said as he stood up. “Come on y’all, we still have some work to do!” JJ called for his staff and slammed it into the ground, changing his, and everyone else’s outfits back into their December Knight garb.

They traveled back to the old woman’s room. The bows on the back of their peacoats morphed into wings and began to glow, making their orbs glow as well. Just then, breath found its way back into the woman’s lungs and she awoke to a glimpse of the December Knights fading into a translucent shimmer. She sat up and called her grandson back to ask him what else he wanted for Christmas.

They were transported to the war-torn neighborhood and slammed their orbs into the ground, opening their wings and flapping them hard enough to send the missile back to where it came. The mother and child reunited with smiles and hugging everyone around them. “Remind me to come back here after Christmas,” JJ whispered to Kiara.

Back at the house of the little boy and firefighter father, the December Knights flew to the fire and were the ones that carried a little girl to safety rather than the father who had done it the first time around. 

The December Knights concluded their mission back at The Realm, making plans to see each other again back at the Holiday Spirits Celebration. JJ and Kiara had 4 more days on the island and Tina, Akari-Maria, & Max had to make arrangements to get to New York with their families. 

“Before we head back to the regular timeline, why don’t we play a few games of tag in a department store, you know for old times’ sake.” Akari-Maria suggested. The group smiled at each other, and all raised their orbs in unison.

They were transported to a huge store, and all their clothing had changed back to the original onesie outfit. They all played tag for an hour before realigning with the timeline.

Once back in Roosevelt, the friends all spent their days together and made a memorable Christmas for everyone. They picked up their friendship right where they left off. Visiting each other throughout the year and making sure Sada was alright. They returned as the December Knights and recruited others to aid in their mission to bring joy to everyone all across the world.

And you can help them as well. It doesn't take much to become a December Knight; all you have to do is try your best to make another laugh and to be a little kinder than you were the day before. Follow those two simple steps and you will be a part of the legacy that the December Knights will keep on for the remainder of time. From my heart to yours, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a very Beautiful, Joy-filled Happy New Year to you and the ones you love. Love your Auntie Cici and Unc!

The year flew by for our four young friends. They wrote to each other and spoke on the phone just like they promised. When December rolled around, they were ecstatic. Auntie Cici and Unc invited the children back and welcomed them with open arms and big smiles. This time around, the children were called back a little earlier than last year, as they were booked for two missions instead of one. 

The first mission consisted of the team wrangling a band of horses that broke out of their stable one Christmas Eve a few years before the children were born. Max really showed his skills here as both of his grandfathers owned a ranch. The children were successful with this endeavor and the joy of riding horses through a snowy forest lit by a big bright moon added to the extravagant Christmas experience.

The second mission was a little more technical. A tiny town on the outskirts of a less known city put on a dazzling light show for all the townsfolk. While the festivities went on, a power outage 40 miles away put a stop to the celebration. Because the town was so small and shared a border with next to nowhere, the possibility of getting the lights and power back on tonight was slim to none. That is until the December Knights intervened. That’s what the children are calling themselves now; I think it’s just the cutest little thing. But back to the story. It was the Knights’ mission to restore the light, however, that meant they had to each be in a different place. Tina took the lead on this mission as she spent a lot of time working on electrical units with her grandmother during school breaks. She gave everyone direction and they did their part, but something just wasn’t correct. She radioed everyone through their earmuffs to confirm how the plan should have gone but there was no fault to be found. At their wits end, Tina said “I have a silly idea, what if one of the wires back in the town came unplugged.” 

“We won’t know until we try.” Akari-Maria answered. 

“Does anyone remember how to get back to the town? For some cosmic reason, I can’t remember how…” Tina stopped her sentence as she turned around to catch the glimpse of..

“HEY! Does anyone else have a huge spirit horse standing in front of them?!” Max shouted.

“Aren’t these the horses we just rescued?!” JJ shouted back.

“I think we just found that cosmic reason you can’t remember where the town is. See you soon!” Akari-Maria said as she settled on top of the horse.

All the children saddled up and rode like lightning back towards the town. And just as Tina predicted, one little outlet was missing its plug. Tina did the honors and when she plugged it in, all the lights came on, and the spirit of Christmas joy was restored in the tiny town. The adults laughed and the children cheered. The December Knights stayed in the town and partook in the festivities. They made themselves visible and had a blast all night long. When it came time to leave as the party dwindled down, one older woman was curious about where the children came from and how they were getting home. She approached them and JJ told her “Shhh, don’t tell anyone, but we’re the December Knights! We’re Christmas spirits sent here to help when we can.” She brushed them off and told him to be careful. He flashed her a smile and turned himself invisible. She froze but was brought back to life when the children became visible for a brief moment as they rode past her on their new companions. However, instead of fear, she had the idea of having all the children in her town ride horses in their winter onesies the following year. She had her granddaughter paint an image of the December Knights with their horses, bringing the lights back to the town and that began the legend of children from around the world bringing light to the people that need it. 

As they made it back to the palace, the children discussed the name that JJ had given to them. “December nights? But we can also show up in the daytime.” Max said.

“No not night but Knight, like a warrior who rides a horse. It was more of a play on words. We’re kind of protectors and we came from an ice castle or palace and we ride horses now. It just made sense to me.” JJ answered.

“I can get behind that. It’s corny but I like it.” Tina said.

“Me too!” Max added.

“Yo tambien!” said Akari-Maria.

 

Another year and another successful mission. The December Knights’ relationship grew stronger as they waited to be reunited. In year three, the children were challenged in more ways than one. They were tasked with preventing an all-out mythological war. One side was led by Eddie the Yeti and the other by his cousin, Sasha Sasquatch. The two were fighting over who would be in charge of the weather amulet that their grandfather had left them. Sasha wanted it to be hot all the time as she enjoyed the warm weather, but Eddie longed for the cold and the snow. They recruited all types of creatures to fight on their side, but their war had devastating consequences. Many homes were destroyed and the best of friends became enemies over choosing the side of either cousin. When the December Knights arrived at the meeting location, they were overwhelmed to say the least; what 13 year-old is any good at mythological diplomacy? In over their heads, JJ cracked a joke about how he’d pass out from a heat stroke if he had Sasha’s fur in the middle of August and that Eddie must smell terrible when it snows because of his fur always getting wet.

The cousins overheard this and could not stop laughing at each other’s expense. He made another joke and the laughter continued. Unicorns, centaurs, fairies, giants and all the other creatures caught the contagious giggles and laughed too. In the following moments, the cousins decided on a resolution of hosting a comedy show to exchange the amulet each year, giving the cousins equal time in their preferred climate. This war took place well before the time of man and is the reason for the seasons. When Eddie the Yeti held the amulet, it was winter and when it was Sasha Sasquatch's turn, it was summer. The fall and spring were transition times when the cousins held their biannual mythological comedy shows. Spring is when Sasha hosted and fall was for Eddie. The success of the mission made great allies of the cousins and December Knights and overall friends to the mythological world. 

Year four was less stressful as the children helped a little boy write the perfect Christmas song for his school’s talent show. And in year five they reunited long lost lovers. Year six, they prevented a flood from destroying a little city. Year seven had the children helping an underdog beach volleyball team win the winter tournament. Year eight was a little different, as this year brought internal struggle; Max had lost his grandfather, so the team spent time consoling him in Houston. The Knights helped him through it, but there was something different in the following years. 

Year nine was a little strained as well, as it was all of their first time in college, so they opted to spend the holidays with their families given how long they were away from them. For year ten, only JJ, Max and Tina were able to assist. Akari-Maria had the chance to return to Japan for a month and couldn’t pass up the opportunity to travel on the designated December 17th when the December Knights would reunite in The Realm. Year eleven brought everyone back but it appeared as though this was the last time they would all be together in The Realm. Each year presented something different that prevented the Knights from reuniting. Intense exams, weddings, work projects, children, and so on and so forth. After a few years, JJ seemed to be the only one that consistently fulfilled his duty as a December Knight. He believed it was his responsibility to carry on the tradition; making the holidays special was his personal creed. However, things went a little differently on the 25th anniversary of his tenure as a December Knight.

“How y’all doing tonight?!” A large crowd erupted with cheers. “I want to welcome everyone to the 12th annual Spectacular of the Holiday Spirits Celebration!” An older Vic said to a large crowd. Everyone cheered and clapped. “My name is Vic and I am honored to be spending this night and rest of these two weeks with this amazing town.” The crowd cheered again. “However, I did want to address the elephant at the dinner table. Our esteemed Jo’Veal Baldwin, also known to many as JJ, will not be in attendance tonight. I know it’s breaking tradition because he’s usually the one up here, starting off the celebration, but he is under the weather and just couldn’t make it, believe me, he tried. But he wanted me to make sure everyone felt welcomed. And once he’s back on his feet, you and I both know he’ll be right out there teaching everyone how to ice skate and being the first to taste test Mrs. Johnson’s famous apple pie. So, from me and JJ, welcome! And if you’re new here, please partake in everything from sleigh riding, coffee shop jazz concerts, our bake off happening in two days, Christmas stories read at the library, the annual snowman bike-a-thon, the numerous plays put on by our elementary, middle and high school students, and our annual Christmas fashion show next Friday and so much more! We have so much to offer for y’all! Make sure you save a dance for JJ at the Big Time New Year’s Eve Ball! Much Love, I’m out!”

The crowd erupted with laughter and joy. There were so much happiness and love throughout the night. Family, friends and strangers came from all over to spend the two weeks in the Christmas town known as Roosevelt, NY. But just as Vic mentioned, JJ was nowhere to be found. The night ended, and the next morning started the two week community breakfast put on by all the churches in the town; all religions and faiths came together, cooked and set up shop at the community center JJ and his friends built 5 years ago. The breakfast was free for all who attended but many gave generous donations to help cover the spread. Typically, JJ would also be here to comically bless the food by mimicking his childhood pastor who was also his youth baseball coach and the town’s librarian. However, JJ’s lighthearted teasing was missed. Many understood that he was probably still under the weather, except for a 14 year-old girl, named Sada from Wyandanch, NY whose godmother and godfather brought her to the Holiday Spirits Celebration three years ago, and each year since. She heard of the celebration through friends and begged them to take her and has been infatuated ever since. She absolutely fell in love with the event and anticipated returning this year. She couldn’t wait to hear JJ’s same old dad joke at the opening ceremony and loved JJ’s impersonation of Pastor Horus. When JJ didn’t make an appearance, she grew concerned about his absence. 

Another day went on and another day no JJ. On the third day, Sada decided to take matters into her own hands, she staked outside of JJ’s house and watched him, looking healthy, get into a cab early in the morning before anyone else was up and drive off. Later that day, Vic mentioned again that due to some personal business matters, JJ won’t be in attendance at the opening night of the middle school’s version of a Christmas Carol. Many people were disappointed because JJ always played Tiny Tim. Sada’s concern quickly went to suspicion. The next day, she decided to follow JJ hoping to get to the bottom of his disappearance. She watched him get into a cab again and decided to follow him on her bike. Luckily for her, JJ didn’t go too far, just to the train station. Keeping her distance, she bought a train ticket as well and boarded the train a few cars back. They ended up in New York City. Sada followed JJ as he made his way through the crowds. He stopped at various tiny stores and coffee shops, buying a small cup, barely taking a sip then tossing it away. He spent a lot of time on a bench in his grandparent’s neighborhood. Then walked to Central Park and sat down by the water. Nothing exciting, just a calm and uneventful day. Confused, Sada reluctantly went back to Roosevelt with nothing to report on. 

Back in her hotel room, Sada began trying to piece what little information she did have, together. She stayed up all night after talking to various townsfolk about JJ’s impact and where his motivation came from to make this town the spectacle that it is. After a long night, she finally drifted off.

She soon woke up and found herself in a haze, in the middle of a forest clearing, greeted by a familiar owl and wolf. Sada followed the pair and entered the palace. In similar fashion to the December Knights, she was floored by the beauty and in awe of the magic that Auntie Cici and Unc shared with her. 

“Okay, so if I’m not dead and I’m supposedly connecting with the deepest parts of myself and the world, then that means for you Unc, there’s a deep human need for community, bonding, peace and joy. And as a result, Auntie Cici you’re the embodiment of that through a holiday where most people of the world celebrate through giving gifts, cooking for each other, traveling far and wide to spend time together, will try to put our differences aside at least for a day and write universal songs and tell heart-wrenching cliche stories for everyone to partake in?” Sada asked.

“More or less.” Auntie Cici responded.

“Sweeeeet.” Sada said with a smile. “Okay, okay so then I must be here because of my investigation of JJ, right? I mean what are the odds that I end up talking to the collective conscience and collective unconscious after a day of following around a person who brought so much joy to so many and all of a sudden avoids it?” Sada said, pacing back and forth.

“This girls’ good.” Unc whispered.

“Aint that right.” Auntie Cici said back. 

“Got it, got it. Okay, can you tell me more about JJ? Maybe I can use that to figure something out.” Sada asked.

“I think it might be better to experience it for yourself.” Auntie Cici said, waving her magic wand.

Footsteps could be heard approaching the center room. All coming from the individual entrances. “No way!” said an older Max walking through the doorway.

“Is this really happening?!” Akari-Maria shouted.

“It’s been so long!” said Tina.

The old friends all ran towards each other and gave an enormous hug and shared dozens of smiles. Auntie Cici and Unc smiled at the reunification. Unc cleared his throat to get their attention. They turned around and repeated their enthusiasm with Auntie Cici and Unc. After some time, Tina asked “where’s JJ?”

“That’s why I’m here,” said Sada. “I was hoping you could help me. JJ hasn’t really been around the last few days, and I was wondering if you could help me find out why and maybe get him back to normal.”

“Uhh, sure kid. But who are you?” Asked Max.

“I’m Sada! I’m staying in JJ’s Christmas town to celebrate the Holiday Spirits Celebration.”

“JJ has a Christmas town?!” Akari-Maria spouted.

“He does! It’s been going on for twelve years!” Asked Sada.

“Has it really been twelve years?” Tina said to no one in particular.

“Had to have been longer.” Max answered.

“Twelve years since what? Are you friends of JJ or are you also psychological and social constructs of humanity?” Jada posited. 

“No, we’re humans. But at one point in time, we were the December Knights or Christmas spirits.” Akari-Maria answered.

“Were?! Oh honey, you still are. And Sada, I think you should join them. There’s no limit on how many Christmas spirits or December Knights there could be. Let me get you all situated with your outfits and the others will explain the history to you Sada, as you continue your investigation!"" Auntie Cici pulled out her magic wand again and gave a wave. Sada was given the same uniform that the Knights wore when they were about her age. However, the adults were all put in a soft, white turtleneck, similar to Unc’s. They all wore red pants and had the same gold furry boots from the first uniform. They were given a green peacoat with a large, white & gold ribbon on the back. They had a red scarf to match their red leather gloves and just like the old days, all four of them had the white fluffy earmuffs with the halo attachment that would glow once they became visible. “Now that you have your uniforms, good luck on your mission!” Auntie Cici said as the floor opened up just like it did on their first time. The December Knights yelled as they fell.

“I just love when that happens!” Unc said with a chuckle. 

The Knights landed in Roosevelt in the middle of the carnival. “Wow! JJ did all this?” Tina asked.

“Sure did! And there’s so much more. I’m not sure if we’ll get to it all just on foot.” Sada answered.

“Maybe ours can’t, but theirs should be able to.” Max said, pointing to their spirit horses.

“Umm, where did those horses come from and we can’t ride those in the middle of the street!” Sada answered. 

“Sure we can, no one can see us, and they’re pretty fast. We even got one for you!” said Akari-Maria. 

 

The team mounted their noble steeds and proceeded to see the Holiday Spirits Celebration in all its glory. As they rode and explored, Sada explained to the group how JJ put this all together. It started when he was 16. He organized a talent show at his high school to help raise money for the community center. That turned into combining the talent show with a dance for the students for which the proceeds helped send students in middle school on a ski trip. Word got out and more people in the community wanted to get involved, so they set up a donation system which morphed into JJ starting his own non-profit to help stay organized. He pursued a degree in business and law, allowing him to learn how to better serve his community through business endeavors and advocating for civil liberties and social justice. His reputation grew, which brought more eyes and more funds. He also used a lot of his own money to invest in companies that virtually cover the entire expense of the celebration. JJ stayed busy. He researched and hired employees to help his yearlong food bank and community garden. He bought land and raised animals on the farm to keep most of the food products inhouse. It’s self-sustaining, just needing caring hands to help work the land here and there, which had been conducted as a community service project, both through volunteer efforts and his deal with the county to help with rehabilitation. The workers would not only work with farming and gardening but would also learn about clean renewable energy and how to build and repair items on their own. JJ became known not only as the town’s head Christmas saint, but also as a figure for change and progress. He had been moving towards a solar punk paradise. The December Knights could not believe just how much their friend had achieved. 

“Maybe we just let JJ rest. If he’s doing this year round, then he needs a break from it all.” Tina suggested.

“While I don’t totally disagree, I think we should still try to find JJ and at least talk with him. A sudden change could be more harmful than good, especially if JJ is acting in the total opposite of what he usually does.” Akari-Maria said.

“Okay kid, show us where the man of the year is. I think it’s time we pay him proper respects,” said Max. 

The December Knights made their way to JJ’s Roosevelt home. But when they entered, there was no one there. Sada turned herself visible to ask if anyone had seen JJ and all said they hadn't. 

“Alright, I guess we head back to The Realm and take it from there.” Sada suggested.

“Hang on kid. Let’s just stay for another 30 minutes to take in the town. Now that we’re in our uniforms, time is on our side. I haven’t spent any time around something like this in so long. I need a little time to enjoy it all,” Max suggested. Sada and the others nodded in agreement.

The Knights walked around a little more, taking in the beauty of the town and participating in a few of the activities.

 

“What have you all been up to?” Max asked as they left the carnival area.

“I guess the latest news for me is that I just signed a deal to purchase some land on the outskirts of Rio. I’m opening a third hospital.” Tina said.

“Congrats! I didn’t know you went into healthcare.” Akari-Maria followed up with.

“Thanks, I’m not directly involved in healthcare. I still do accounting, but I’ve taken an interest in providing more opportunities for others. I guess I still have some December Knight in me after all.” Answered Tina.

“I just finished my first semester for my PhD in Education; I moved to the states after college and fell in love with this little town in Mississippi a few years ago and worked as an after school director. I figured I could be a bigger staple in the community by not only working with the littles but also showing them that they can achieve the highest. So, I’m going on this journey with them. I tell them about the program and have the high schoolers sit in on some of the courses I teach at the college as a part of the program. It’s nice giving back again.” Akari-Maria said.

“Niceeee Akari! I bet they love that. Does that mean that you’re officially done with the fashion world stuff?” Max asked.

“I still have one foot in. I’ll consult on wardrobe for projects as they come my way but designing and coordinating from beginning to end is a lot of work that I don’t have the drive for anymore. How’s the construction business going?” She asked Max.

“Ahh I sold it a couple years back. The day to day was a mess. I started volunteering at this animal sanctuary. It's given me a lot of free time to spend at home. Four kids under 10 takes an army to raise. I still have my HVAC and plumbing contracts but working with the animals reminds me of all those missions we used to do.” Max said “You know, I haven’t told the Mrs. about all the stuff we did. I never thought anyone would believe me.”

“I tell my little girl our adventures as bedtime stories. My husband would eavesdrop and ask me all the time where these stories came from. I told him they were stories my parents told me as a child. It’s such a shame how much life can get in the way; I really miss the time we spent together. It’s nice having people that understand all the craziness.”

“Remember after our first mission when we played hide ‘n seek in Toys’R’Us? God, what I would give to do that again.” Akari-Maria said.

“Of course! JJ let me borrow some funds to purchase my first ever American football. I taught my eight year old how to throw over the summer with it.” Max followed up with.

“How about when we baked cookies for that preschool’s Christmas pageant for like three years in a row.” Tina said with a smile.

“Man, growing up sucks. I miss all of this so much.” Akari-Mari huffed.

“Not for JJ. Cuz’s been living a Christmas movie for the last 25 years. He is the epitome of intentional. When I grow up, I wanna be just like him.” Max quipped. The group laughed.

“Who says we can’t be?” Tina said after the chuckles slowed down. “Really. This place is beautiful. My baby would love it here. I would love it here. Christmas for us growing up was so magical because someone intentionally made it that way. I think it’s our turn to do the same.”

“The purpose of life is Christmas lights, as JJ would always say. Count me in!” Max exclaimed.

“Yo tambien!” Akari-Maria shouted.",1,1764613472.0,u_kofarahscitadel,0,1.0,False

I’m like, “wow, maybe I actually have my life together, maybe this is my turning point arc.” Then randomly, sometimes literally the next day, I feel like an NPC just going through pre-programmed dialogue options. Same commute, same small talk, same websites, just… running the script. Nothing is \*wrong\*, but nothing feels particularly real either.

  
What’s weird is there’s rarely a big event that triggers the switch. It’s like my brain just quietly flips a toggle in the background: “today you are a side character in everyone else’s story, please stand by.” And then I spend the day kind of watching myself move through routines instead of feeling like I’m actively choosing anything. Then out of nowhere something tiny (a song, a random conversation, cleaning my desk) snaps me back into “okay, I’m actually here and present” mode again.

  
Does anyone else experience this weird on/off sense of presence and importance in your own life?

Since I had to wait 2 days to travel home, I had to keep them in my family fridge and told everyone not to open them.

Just went to pack to check space in my bag and see the seal has been cracked and there's foam in the nozzle... It was sealed when I put it in there. I've asked everyone and no one is owning up. They didn't even rinse out the nozzle afterwards. And now that it's open it has to be used and may even leak in my bag on the way home. No one asked.

When I asked my mom she shrugged her shoulders and left the room so I think it night have been her... It's so mean and disrespectful. I know it's just fecking coffee cream but they are so shitty to me in general. I'm so pissed.

The Fix Was a Single Character.,"So, picture this. I'm working on this huge, mission-critical feature for a client. The deadline is breathing down my neck, and the project manager is starting to use that *voice*. You know the one. The feature is supposed to process a bunch of data and send a neat little package to a server. But it's not working. And when I say 'not working,' I mean it's failing so silently it's spooky. No errors, no crash logs, no network traffic... nothing. The data just vanishes into the ether.

My first thought? 'Okay, must be a simple networking issue.' I spend the next few hours checking firewalls, ports, and server configs. Everything looks perfect. So I dive deeper. I'm tracing every single function call, stepping through the code line by line until my eyes bleed. I start going crazy, questioning everything. Is it a compiler bug? A weird memory leak? Did a solar flare flip a specific bit on the server at the exact wrong nanosecond? By day two, I'm fueled by cold coffee and pure desperation, convinced the universe has a personal grudge against me.

Finally, at my wit's end, I lean back in my chair and just stare at the screen, completely defeated. I decide to review the code from the absolute beginning one last time. I'm scrolling through the file that kicks the whole process off, a file I've already looked at a dozen times. But this time, my sleep-deprived brain sees it. A single line of code, the most important function call in the entire sequence, is sitting there, innocently grayed out. It looked like this: `;sendTheData();`. Yep. A single, accidental semicolon before the function call, which in this language (JavaScript) just created a valid, empty statement and effectively turned the most critical part of the feature into a comment.

I stared at it for a solid minute, a weird mix of rage, relief, and humiliation washing over me. I deleted the semicolon, hit 'run,' and everything worked perfectly. Two full days of frantic, high-stress debugging, solved by deleting a single character. I felt like the smartest idiot in the entire world.

The children screamed as they fell into a swirl of dream-like clouds and landed hard but not harmful on top of a New York city building. 

“Ouch!” Max shouted. “I guess these wings are just for show.”

“Did that really hurt you?” Tina asked.

“No, but the idea of it did. Force of habit I guess.” Max responded as Akari-Maria and Tina helped him up.

“Come take a look at this!” JJ gestured to them. “Welcome to New York City!” 

“No way! It’s more beautiful than I imagined.” Akari-Maria said. The children were facing out to the skyline, full of the typical New York lights but the skyline was made even more magical with Christmas lights abound in the city. 

“Come on! Let’s go solve this mission then I can show you all around!” JJ said, jumping off the building without a care. The children gasped in shock as JJ fell. “Don’t worry! It doesn't hurt!” He said, landing like the superheroes he idolized.

“Here goes nothing!” Tina shouted as she followed suit. Akari-Maria and Max did the same and laughed as they landed. “Thank you Auntie Cici and Unc!” Tina giggled.

“Okay we have to get to Brooklyn. We’re right at the bridge. We can take bikes over then get our way to the apartment. Come on, let’s borrow some from this bike shop around the corner.” JJ said as he jogged up the block. The other children followed him. 

“Wouldn’t that be stealing?” Max asked.

“Not if we bring them back. Besides we’re Christmas spirits, I think the universe won’t mind us using them for a little while. I mean Auntie Cici and Unc are kind of embodiments of the universe. In a way, they gave us permission. We can ask them to return it to normal or something. They’re magic right?” JJ responded.

“I don’t think that’s how it works but we’re strapped for time so let’s just go. We have to come back this way anyway.” Akari-Maria added.

The children walked into the store and picked out the bike they loved the most and rode from the store in a fury of fun and determination. However, their joy was cut short when they noticed a man in a business suit noticing them. At first, they were weirded out by this man staring at them, especially when he dropped his coffee and briefcase to rub his eyes. But then Tina pointed out “oh no, we’re invisible but our bikes aren't!"" 

“Tina you’re right!” Akari-Maria said. “We can’t ride through the city like this!”

“New plan! The train!” JJ shouted as he popped a U-turn,

 

The children returned the bikes and made their way towards the nearest train station. With it being everyone’s first time except for JJ’s, the train ride was a source of laughter for him. The three of them had trouble standing up and kept knocking into people which caused others to get upset, because to all on the train, it looked like everyone was clumsy and knocking everyone over, but JJ knew it was his very green teammates causing the havoc.

They made it to their stop and found their way to the apartment. “Okay, pretty straight forward, we just have to wait until exactly 6:17p to prevent the catastrophe,” said Akari-Maria. 

“Right, but if we’re waiting right here, how can we prevent the catastrophe?” Tina asked.

“What do you mean? Auntie Cici said we have to stop the mom from using the stairs.” Akari-Maria retorted. 

“No, we have to keep the dad from using the side entrance.” Tina responded.

“Hang on, what’s this about a mom and dad? I thought we had to make sure the candles properly went out?” Max asked.

“I think we have different parts of the mission. I have to go!” JJ said in a sprint.

“I think he’s right!” Tina added. She too made her way towards the stairs. 

“I have to get into that apartment!” Max shouted as he went to bang on the door.

“Wait! How am I supposed to keep the mom from going downstairs?” Akari-Maria asked. 

“I don’t know! Turn yourself visible. I have to make sure that candle stays out!” Max blurted. 

The door opened to a middle aged woman who happened to be on her way out. Max, still invisible, snuck by her into the apartment. “Hello?” The woman asked. “I could’ve sworn somebody was knocking on this door. Okay kids, I’ll be back later, your father should be home soon. Make sure you blow the candles out before you go to bed, love you!” She shouted as she closed and locked the door. Akari-Maria, visibly nervous to us, stood frozen, unseen by the woman making her way towards the stairs. Akari-Maria followed behind her and closed her eyes to turn her halo light on, making herself visible to the people on this plane. 

Akari-Maria jumped towards the woman and pulled on her coat. The woman was startled and turned around to see Akari-Maria there. “Oh my, was that you knocking on my door before?” The woman asked. Akari-Maria made no sound. “Is everything okay sweety?” The woman said, kneeling down towards her. Akari-Maria just starred. “Can you talk honey? Are you hurt?” the woman asked. Akari-Maria, without thinking, said something in Japanese. The woman was confused but still comforted her. “Okay, I don’t understand you but I know someone who might.” The woman took Akari-Maria by the hand and tried to lead her towards the stairwell, but Akari-Maria resisted and pointed to her leg. The woman nodded her head to convey an understanding and suggested she carry her and use the elevator instead. Akari-Maria agreed and they waited for the elevator to arrive for them.

Tina made it downstairs and sprinted towards the side of the building. She saw the dad that was assigned to her heading towards the alley. She ran towards him and tried to nudge him in another direction, but the man just thought he was bumping into a mailbox as he was distracted reading his newspaper. She made another attempt by trying to trip him, but he only stumbled a little bit, blaming it on the uneven curb. Her final trick to prevent him from walking down the alley was to steal his newspaper and pretend it was floating in the wind. The man chased after it, passing the alley. Tina had the paper ‘float’ all the way to the front of the building, making him decide to use this entrance, rather than the side entrance’s short cut. Just as he passed the side of the building, debris from the neighboring construction site had fallen into the alley. The alley was closed off but the man still snuck into it because he believed it saved him time. He went to look back to see the loud bang and once he realized it would’ve been him crushed instead of the garbage can, he made a religious gesture and understood that the extra two minutes he saved were no longer worth it. Once in the lobby, he saw his wife holding Akari-Maria in her arms. “Hey love, who’s this?” He asked as he gave her a kiss on the cheek.

“I don’t know. She knocked on our door as I was leaving. I think she speaks Japanese; I’m going to take her over to Mrs. Yamada’s to find out what’s going on. What are you doing over here? Don’t you always take your life saving short cut?” 

“Not today. And not again until that construction is done. I’m just glad to see you.” 

At this point, Akari-Maria squirmed out of the woman’s arm and ran outside. The woman tried to chase after her but was too distracted by the loud bang and flashing of electricity coming from the stairwell. “What a weird two minutes,” the woman said with a curious face. 

Back in the apartment, Max cautiously waited in the living room for one of the kids to do what their mother asked and blow out the candles. Growing anxious that the children wouldn’t do it, Max made a loud noise to get their attention. This worked, as a teenager emerged, holding her 4 year sister in her arms. She placed the little girl down and blew out the candle then went to the fridge for a snack. She looked and smiled at the four year old and went back to her room. The four year old sat there for a moment then let out a mischievous smile as she went to climb onto the table that had candy on it. This is also the same table that had another candle on it that in fact was not fully blown out. Max, waiting in the living room for that candle to reignite, hadn’t realized that the dining room table was the candle of concern. The flame had already come back to life and was positioned on the table’s runner, which the four year old used to climb to get to the candy. When she tugged on the runner, the candle fell, causing a small flame on some of the coloring paper that had been left behind. Max heard the thump and immediately ran to the table. He was shocked by the flame and froze for a brief moment until the four year old let out a cry. Snapping Max back into reality, he jumped at the vase with flowers on the table and dumped the water on the flame and quickly put it out. The teenager hearing all the commotion ran out of her room and saw the mess that she of course blamed on the four year old. The little one insisted that it wasn’t her fault and that a ghost was the one who caused it, but the teenager told her to stop lying and to help her clean up the mess. Max let out a sigh and left the apartment, accidentally letting the door slam behind him. “What was that?!” The teenager shouted. “See, told you it was a ghost.” The four year old yelled back.

JJ arrived to his post on the roof. However, the sign that Unc gave him to look out for was not what he expected. He located the clue and realized his mission was meant for three buildings over. He jumped off the roof again to make his escape quicker than running down the stairs. He bolted passed civilians, bringing with him a breeze that they mistook for the wind. He made it to the building, but the door was locked so he had to climb the fire escape. Climbing faster than he had in the past, JJ made it to the top just in time to see his mission walking towards the edge. 

“WAIT!” He yelled. 

A little boy no older than himself, turned around at the aggressive sound of the wind. 

“Hang on, just give me a moment!” JJ shouted again. 

The younger boy turned around again, believing the wind was now talking to him. 

JJ remembering that he was invisible, closed his eyes tight to turn his halo light on, making himself visible to the little boy on the roof.

“What the heck?!” The little boy shouted. “Who are you? What do you want?”

“I’m JJ, I’m here to help,” he said, still trying to catch his breath. 

“What are you supposed to be, some Christmas angel or something?” said the boy.

“Something like that. I’m a spirit but that’s not important. What is important is why you came up here.”

“If you’re some spirit then you know why I came up here. I’m sick of this life. I’m ready for the next one!” The boy shouted from the rooftop.

“Hold on, hold on. Let’s calm down a little bit. I think there’s still time to make this one a little better. Why don’t you tell me what’s going on. Just give me five minutes.” JJ said, holding out his hand. The kid looked at him and shook it. “I told you my name, what’s yours?”

“Daniel, but you can call me Danny.” Danny answered.

“Nice to meet you, Danny. Wanna fill me in?” JJ asked.

“You don’t know already? I thought you were a spirit.” Danny snarked.

“I’m not that kind of spirit. I just got my wings today and they don’t even work.” JJ responded while looking back at the wings.

“Well, it’s no secret. It feels like everyone knows and they don’t care. I’m living in this stupid group home because my dad made up a story about my mom abusing me. He said she’s not taking care of us because I was home alone and had to cook for myself. Of course I was home alone, she had to work because he ran off with one of his secretaries and left us again. He makes all that money on Wallstreet and can’t even send us a dime. I know how to cook. She taught me everything! But he just wants me to live with him and make her mad. I hate him! He doesn’t even do nothing with me when I go over his house. I’m by myself more over there than I am with my mom. And at least she loves me.” Danny said, pacing back and forth.

“I’m sorry Danny, that sounds awful.” JJ said.

“And it keeps getting worse. I finally met a friend at the group home. A real nice girl, she’s like 13 or something. Helped me write a letter to my mom telling her how much I miss her and stuff and how I wanna go back to Staten Island. Even let me cry in her lap and didn’t make fun of me like some of the church ladies did. So, I asked her how she ended up here and she told me that she was from a different state. She got moved all around and stuff. She said it was called something like a traffic jam or something, I don’t remember but I do remember she said she had a baby they took away from her. Can you believe it? A kid like me had a baby and they took it away from their mom just like they took me away from mine. What’s wrong with these people? They said they’re here to help but all they do is tell us how much stuff we do wrong. Those nun ladies, fake nuns really because the ones I know would never say something like that, kept saying how it was the girl’s fault for having the baby and that’s why it got taken away. What a mean thing to say. The girl didn’t even want the baby in the first place, but somebody made her have it. She said she almost died when she pushed her out. And then they take it away from her! Another one of the kids I met was smaller than me and had broken ribs because his mom and dad got mad at him because he was struggling with reading. Can you believe it? We’re kids! We’re not supposed to deal with nothing like this. So, you tell me why I shouldn’t jump off the building. What’s the point of it all? The priest said God has a plan, but what kind of a plan is this? Why do so many kids hurt and why do grownups say they care when they don’t?! They don’t listen to us, they never do!” Danny was now crying his words.

JJ gave Danny a big hug and just held him tightly. Danny didn’t resist at all. 

“I don’t want to die JJ but I don’t want to live like this no more. I just want my mommy. Why can’t I have my mommy?” Danny said as he cried into JJ’s chest. 

The boys stayed in each other’s arms in silence for about 5 minutes. “Why don’t you tell me some of the things you used to do with your mom?” JJ asked Danny. Danny wiped his eyes and began to list off a bunch of things he and his mother would do on the weekend. JJ then asked him to make a list of all the things that he wants to do with his mother when he gets older. He listed very sentimental things that he would look forward to. The boys laughed at some of the suggestions JJ made and talked a little longer before Danny thanked JJ for listening. As they made their way towards the stairwell. JJ said “You know the purpose of life is Christmas lights, right?”

“What?” Danny asked.

“The purpose of life is Christmas lights. It's what my gramma says to me. She actually says a bunch of different things like ‘the purpose of life is art’ or ‘the purpose of life is laughter’ what it means is life is always changing, sometimes it gets better and sometimes it gets worse, so you should always change its purpose to fit the need of the moment. I think for you ‘the purpose of life is Christmas lights’ means that you should take your new friends to see some Christmas lights. It’ll probably make their lives a little easier for now and then you can change life’s purpose to something else the next day. Like ‘the purpose of life is snowball fights.’ Or the purpose of life is to care for kids because some grownups don’t. Look Danny, I’m pretty new to this spirit stuff, so I hope this is helpful. But even if it’s not, I’m really glad you shared all the things you’re looking forward to. I really hope you get to enjoy life the way you want to.” 

“Thanks JJ. I’m really happy I had someone to really listen to me. You’re not so bad for a Christmas angel or spirit or whatever you are. I’ll check out that show Wayans Bros. it sounds pretty funny. And I guess I can give the purpose thing a try too. I think life’s purpose right now is some cookies and soda.” Danny said with a smile.

“I like the way you think, Danny. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!” JJ said as Danny walked down the stairs. 

JJ waited for the door to close before checking his watch for the time. He double checked because he only three minutes before he needed to get back to The Realm. In a rush of emotions, he went to jump off the roof to meet back up with his new friends. However, when he jumped, instead of doing a superhero landing like he had been practicing, he actually floated. “I can fly? I can fly!” He shouted as he soared through the cold December air. 

The rest of the team all met up in the air as it would appear by completing this mission, they all achieved the ability to use their wings.

“Okay, two more minutes before we trapped here, how are we going to get back to the meeting spot?!” Max shouted.

Just then, the quick change of a large clock, turning back four hours caught their eyes. A billboard of a woman, winked at the children.

“I think we’ll be alright!” Tina responded.

Now that they had more time, they were able to see the city in a timely manner and enjoy all the things JJ told them about before making it back to The Realm. Once back in The Realm, they shared their stories with Auntie Cici and Unc and laughed about how much fun they had. 

As the night went on, it grew closer for the team to return to their lives and wake up from the deep sleep they were in. They all said their goodbyes but not before exchanging information to send letters and make phone calls to each other until the following Christmas to help those in need once again. 

JJ finally woke up lying in a hospital bed with all his friends waiting for him. They cheered with joy when he made a quip about wanting a rematch in ice skating. They brought him some food, and the group resumed their new tradition of watching sitcoms until it was time for bed. It was indeed a Merry Christmas for JJ and his friends, the ones in Harlem and the ones across the world.

It was a different kind of noise here: the clatter of aging keyboards, the hum of servers, the low murmur of journalists negotiating with sources who didn’t want to be named.

Kareem Hassan sat in his glass-walled office at the far end, a fishbowl of stress amidst the open-plan chaos. He didn’t look up when Lena tapped on the doorframe. He just slid her printout across his desk. It was bleeding red ink.

“Paragraph four,” he said, finally looking at her over the rim of his glasses. “And seven. And the entire conclusion.”

“They’re accurate,” Lena said, stepping inside and closing the door.

“They’re suicide,” Kareem corrected. He tapped the paper with a nicotine-stained finger. “‘Systematic erasure of heritage’? ‘State-sponsored displacement’? Lena, we are a newspaper, not a manifesto. You want to get us shut down?”

“I want to tell the truth about Warraq. Fifteen thousand people are losing their homes.”

“Then tell the truth that can be printed.” He sighed, rubbing his temples. He looked older than fifty, worn down by decades of navigating the thin red lines of Egyptian media. “The Ministry is already breathing down our necks about the licensing renewal. I can’t run this. Soften the language. Focus on the ‘human cost of modernization’. Drop the accusations against the developer.”

Lena stiffened. “The developer *is* the story, Kareem. ‘New Horizon Development’ is a ghost. I tracked their ownership to a shell company in Cyprus. If we don’t mention them, we’re just reporting on the weather.”

“The developer,” he cut her off, his voice hard, “is a red line. We don’t have the legal budget to fight them. And I don’t have the energy.” He pushed the pages further toward her. “Fifteen hundred words. Sanitized. Or I kill the piece.”

Another algorithm executing its logic: survival over honesty.  
The curtain the prophet spoke of wasn’t just smoke; it was red ink.

She took the pages. “Fine.”

––––––––––

A few hours later and fifteen hundred words on Warraq. Revised. Sanitized. Her original language deemed “too strong” for a newspaper in Egypt.

Lena closed her laptop and sat in the dimming newsroom, listening to the call to prayer layer over itself as different mosques fell out of sync, creating strange harmonies that hadn’t been designed but emerged anyway from the overlapping declarations of faith.

She packed her satchel, nodded to the security guard on her way out—a different one now, the evening shift—and stepped back into the world.

The square at dusk was a different creature than at noon. The heat had broken enough to make movement bearable. Families emerged. The vendors switched from cold drinks to hot tea and roasted corn. The traffic remained insane, but the quality of the insanity changed—became almost festive.

Lena walked slowly this time, no deadline chasing her. She wasn’t ready to be pressed into humanity on the metro quite yet. She’d walk to the station the long way, around the square’s perimeter, giving herself time to decompress.

The obelisk rose before her, lit now by spotlights that turned the pink granite golden. The mad prophet was gone. Of course he was. She hadn’t really expected him to still be there, but some small part of her had wondered.

She tilted her head back, looking past the granite tip of the ancient stone, searching the sky. The sky was a hazy, grey-orange blanket, suffocating the horizon. Not a single star in sight.

And as she descended into the metro station, her phone buzzed. Unknown number.

She almost ignored it—probably spam—but opened it anyway.

Two lines, no signature:

*The rot starts locally.*  
*Follow the water.*

Below that: an encrypted file attachment.

She stared at the screen, frozen.

Prologue:

Forever Sonder

According to the Kuwa,

There is no beginning,

There is no end.

All there is, is the reimagining.

Immortality resides within the memory of a yesterday

The current moment of the now

And the glimpse of a dream for tomorrow.

For they are one in the same.

We are one and the same.

This is your story too –

Whether this has happened to you in the past,

Is happening to you in the now,

Or you’ll soon experience it,

You are the protagonist,

You’ve always been.

You are now a child of the Sun,

You’ve always been.

Goooood Eveninggggg my beautiful people! Tis the season to indeed be jolly! And yes, I said evening because we all know the joy of the season is just after the sun goes down and all of the lights come on and the decorations are beaming with the glorious kindness and friendship. I want to welcome you all to this joyous moment and thank you for lending your ear to a new but familiar Christmas tale. Let us enjoy this pocket of time together and let go of our fears and trade them for cheers! I will be your narrator on this lovely journey into the meaning of a smile and snowflakes gently falling to rest on your pretty little head. You can call me Auntie CiCi - more on my backstory when we get to Act II of this snowy tall tale! But without further ado, let’s get into it!

Our story begins with the cutest little ten year-old boy, JJ! On one December afternoon, JJ and a close friend of his, Vic, were walking through the busy streets of Harlem and came across an inescapable aspect of fate; a neighborhood bully. You see, JJ’s grandparents and their parents had been living in Harlem for 70 years, but JJ was from a town called Roosevelt on Long Island, New York. So, anytime he got the chance to visit the city, his little heart would be filled with all the joy in the world. New York City around Christmas time is one of the prettiest places you could ever be. The streets are filled with Christmas lights, the air has hints of hot chocolate, and the people are a little nicer than usual. Christmas time was JJ’s favorite time of year; nothing could get in the way of the warmth a Happy Holidays and wink from a jolly stranger could bring for JJ. That is until JJ and his friend ran into Kenny from 127th. 

Each day for the week JJ spent in Harlem, he and Vic would have to walk past Kenny from 127th and another 14 year-old boy, Ducky, while on their way to visit a friend JJ’s known since he was three, a precious little girl named Kiara. You see, JJ only saw his friends from Harlem during Christmas break and a few weeks in the summer. He and Vic would meet up first because Vic lived close to JJ’s grandparents and they would walk together to visit Kiara. But this year, that trip to Kiara would be a test of bravery and wit.

On the first encounter JJ had with Kenny, Kenny stopped JJ and Vic, making them pay a ‘crossing fee’. JJ and Vic resisted but Kenny lifted JJ up by his jacket and shook the loose singles JJ had out of his pocket. Vic decided it was just easier to give Kenny the $5 he had rather than be hung upside down. “You lucky it’s cold outside and I have my mittens on or I woulda smacked that big bald head of yours into next week! What kind of 14 year-old goes bald this early anyway!” JJ shouted as he was almost a block away from the bullies. Kenny heard this and chased after the boys but luckily, they got away. The second day, JJ had a clever idea and offered to give Kenny money for the fare before Kenny could even threaten him, however, the money he paid was counterfeit and had an image of Marlon Wayans smiling instead of George Washington. The fake money aided in their escape but only up to the point that prevented a meeting of fist-to-cuffs; they were both pelted with snowballs as they laughed at the thought of getting away. One hit Vic in the back of the knee, forcing him to buckle to the ground. And another hit JJ square in the back of the head, forcing him to hit the deck in a looney-toonarian fashion. On the third day, the boys brought in three accomplices and had them sneak up behind the bullies for an old trick of the trade. Two of the boys pants the bullies while the third kneeled behind them for them to be pushed over. However, the plan went a lot smoother in thought than in execution. Kenny and Ducky grabbed JJ and Vic as they went down so now there was a pile of young boys rolling around in the snow, all trying to get the upper hand on each other. In a fit of rage, Vic punched JJ in the nose thinking he was Kenny and Kenny had Ducky in a headlock believing this to be JJ. What snapped the boys out of it was a neighborhood Granny chasing the boys with a broom. “When I catch you, I’m gonna kill you twig head!” Kenny shouted at JJ as he was hit by the broom. “Not if I catch you first Baldy Brown! You better put that hat back on before you get brain freeze!” JJ shouted back, but not before running backwards into a parked car. 

The next day JJ was fired up to fight Kenny. Vic tried to talk him out of it, but JJ said “nah man, I can’t go out like no punk! I watched all the Rockies and Ninja Turtles last night and been shadowing boxing all morning! The only way he can defeat me is if the sun reflects off that shiny head of his!” “It’s not worth it, JJ, we can figure something else out.” “Nope nope! That big idiot is shaking people down in front of a children’s hospital. Who knows how many people he’s bothered. I’m gonna stop him!”

Full of energy, JJ pretended to fight the air all the way to the corner Kenny and Ducky stood on every day. JJ sprinted towards the boy, unexpectedly leaving behind Vic and the other three boys he brought for back up. In an instant, JJ broke into his worst Michael Jackson impression and kicked his leg up in the air and shouted “you aint bad! You aint nothin! You aint nothin! Come on with it!” and kicked his leg in the air again before putting up the most uncoordinated boxing stance anyone has ever seen. With the most serious of faces, he growled at his antagonist and took an unathletic lung at him.

Everyone, including Vic and JJ’s comrades burst into a hearty laugh. Ducky fell to the ground and Kenny had to lean over to keep himself up. JJ took this as the perfect opportunity to jump on Kenny’s back and try to choke him. But Kenny kept laughing and stood up to fling JJ into a pile of snow. 

JJ struggled to get up but Kenny offered a helping hand to pull him out. JJ smacked his hand away and rolled down the pile and clumsily stood up to attempt to fight again. He lunged again and Kenny held him back by grabbing his head. “Look man, I’m trying to apologize. I don’t want to fight you. I’m sorry for messing with you. Here, take your money back.” Stunned by the generous gesture, JJ stopped fighting which made him fall to the ground in a loud grunt. Kenny picked him back up and dusted him off. 

“Sorry?! What do you mean sorry? Why don’t you want to fight anymore?” JJ grunted

“Because it was stupid and I was wrong,” said Kenny.

“Why the change of heart?” JJ muttered as he relaxed his shoulders.

“I had a session with my therapist, and he showed me how hurtful I was being.” Kenny sighed.

“Therapist? I didn’t take you for the emotional type. I guess you got more than air in that big bald head of yours.” JJ said with a little more cheer than anger.

“Well, he’s actually my cousin, in college to become a therapist. But my family thought I should talk to him. The truth is, I was angry at the world. My brother is in this hospital and I overheard my grandma talking about how expensive his bill was going to be. I thought I could get some money to help cover it. I know it was stupid, but I was desperate.” Kenny said, rubbing his head.

“Oh man, your brother is in there? How long has it been?” asked JJ.

“Since the summer. He’s got what I had, Leukemia. I just finished treatment in October. My dad won’t tell me anything about him getting better and my mom just cries all the time. So, I’m left to cope on my own as my cousin would say.” Kenny softly chuckled.

“That sounds terrible. Now I feel awful for almost whooping ya ass.” JJ snickered.

Both boys chuckled. “Actually, the last few days made things a little better. I used that money I took from you guys to get some hotdogs for me and my brother. Then when I saw Marlon Wayans’ face on that fake money I put on the Wayans Bros and watched it with my brother. I haven’t heard him laugh like that in so long. And he saw us fight yesterday and asked me about it so I made up a lie and told him I had a snowball fight with some friends. His eyes lit up because we always had snowball fights before we both got sick. Thank you for that. And now I get to tell him about your Michael Jackson impersonation and show him how to do the moon walk. But I’m sure he saw it for himself.” Kenny pointed up at his brother’s room. Another bald little boy was there waving at the boys on the street. Everyone waved back.

“Hey! He looks like little Bill.” 

Kenny laughed again and put his hand out for JJ to shake. JJ took it and they both nodded at each other.

“If you’re not doing anything, me and the guys are going to go down to Bryant Square Park tomorrow and teach ourselves how to ice skate. You and mini Green Mile should come with us.” JJ said pointing at Ducky.

Kenny laughed and said “Yeah, that sounds like a plan. 10:30a?”

“I’ll see you there, Headie Murphy!”

Kenny laughed again. “Kenny. My name’s Kenny.”

“I’m JJ. We’ll see you down there.”

“Oh and one more thing, You dropped your watch yesterday. I wanted to make sure I got it back to you.”

“Thanks man, I can’t believe I lost it. You’re a life saver!” JJ jumped into Kenny’s arms and gave him a big hug. 

And just like that, the boys became friends. They met up for ice skating and had a blast. Afterwards they bought some pastries and coffee that eventually became hot chocolate after they all spat it out for being too bitter. They walked around Central Park and had snowball fight before taking the train back to Harlem where they went to JJ’s house and put a marathon of Wayans brothers movies and other sitcoms like Martin, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Living Single, Sister Sister, That’s So Raven, Kenan and Kel and other shows that made them laugh and fill the house with joy. 

The next day, the boys planned to do the same thing. They met for breakfast then rode the train down to 40th and grabbed their skates to finish the races they competed in the day before. The boys were no professionals, but they were pretty good. Unfortunately, with ice skating in NYC, after a while you’re only as good as the people around you. While coming around the bend for the final leg of a 3 lap race, an unexpected novice skater jumped in the way of JJ flying towards the finish line. JJ managed to dodge the skater but couldn’t miss the wall that kept everyone in. He thought he could clear it by jumping over it but just like in his fight with Kenny, he underestimated the natural order of big things vs. small things. He went flying, doing a flip in the air and becoming very acquainted with the tree that halted his flight path. Everyone rushed to his aid and did their best to wake him up, but JJ was out cold. It wasn’t long before EMS showed up and got him loaded up in the truck to take him to the very children’s hospital the group of boys met at.

1pbk7sb,https://i.redd.it/pelvy853wm4g1.jpeg,Can’t decide on my living room layout,"Hello. Me and my partner cannot come to an agreement on the layout of our living room and hoping someone could share some light on this. It’s very square shaped and has a window and two entranceways, as a result it feels like the layout is pretty much set in stone. We currently have a sofa along the right hand wall, with a low tv unit and tv in the centre of the left hand wall. This currently leaves the walls with the doors and windows on undisturbed. I would ideally like to incorporate a corner sofa (there’s 5 of us) and a sideboard unit for storage. He would like a fake fireplace wall with mantle etc. neither of us care about floor lamps and coffee tables etc. The tv doesn’t necessarily need to go above the fireplace either. And the door can be slightly obstructed as we don’t use it as a main door. 

So my question is, are any or all of these things possible? Is there a layout that would make most sense here? I’m at a loss. 

Thankyou all. ",1,1764612886.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False
1pbk6te,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1pbk6te/ideas_for_setup/,Ideas for setup,"I have a functional setup but need advice/ideas.

**Main workspace:**  
32"" curved monitor  
Sit/stand desk  
Bluetooth keyboard & mouse  
Gaming laptop with AMD Ryzen 5 (dates from 2019), 256GB internal - my daily driver  
Work-provided laptop for WFH  
HDMI switch   
EHD (HDD) attached 

**Second workspace (family photo scanning):**  
21.5"" iMac, Late 2013, that runs Catalina 10.15, 1TB internal  
It has NTFS+ installed  
Bluetooth keyboard & mouse  
Plustek Scanner

**When I travel or work from a coffee shop:**  
Dell laptop with Intel Core i5 (dates from 2017), 256GB internal

**Pros:**  
Love the curved monitor. I have Parsec on all four machines so I can remote in to any of them from any workstation.

**Struggles:**

(1) Gaming laptop runs all the productivity software I need and does it very well, but graphics card is not capable of running 2025-era STEAM games at a normal or high level. Also minimal disk space so games are running off the HDD.

(2) The 21.5"" iMac runs the scanner software (I'm working on a family photo scanning project), Opera, Cyberduck, Parsec, and is not capable of much else. The display is mint and I love how this machine looks. This was my daily driver until 2019 when I bought the gaming laptop. This iMac is so outdated, but the display is SO nice. It can't be upgraded past Catalina, so most new software won't run. 

(3) The Dell laptop was a refurbished used, probably was a corporate leased one. It's not high-end but just like my gaming laptop it is capable. It's not attached to any of my home setups so it is the most portable and easiest to take for travel and WFA locations (no tangle of cables or dongles to detach.) But, I'm not getting much use out of it. 

(4) Likely can't do any machine replacement until late 2026.  I've got to mainly work with what I've got. Planning one small upgrade which is replacing my external HDD with an SSD so STEAM games can run slightly better.

**Ideas - Opinions Needed:**

(1) Use the iMac mainly as a monitor via Parsec for the Dell and the gaming laptop (in other words, give up on using its Apple functions.)  I could continue using it for local disk storage.  Or I could continue to use it for the sole purpose of family photo scanning since it does work for that.  One concern is that Parsec might eventually stop supporting Catalina.  So far I've only found one working browser (it's an older version of Opera). FF, Chrome, and Safari all crash. As long as Cyberduck continues to work, I can move files to/from the cloud.

(2) I'm not sure if there's any advantage to trying to get more value out of the Dell. It's already meeting the need of having an easy/functional travel laptop. 

(3) When finances open up (maybe Black Friday sales in 2026?) it seems like the highest priority is replacing my daily driver gaming laptop with a new one that is more capable.  That would free up my current gaming laptop to either (a) become my new travel machine, or (b) replace the iMac entirely.  Maybe at that point it is the right time to sell the Dell while it can still be useful for someone?

(4) I am not miserly but I feel really badly that this iMac looks so good and has useable space, but I can't get more out of it. I've seen it listed for only about $100 used so it doesn't seem like there's a lot of benefit to selling it. I imagine it would go into the e-waste stream and at least hopefully be recycled.
