The Enduring Legacy of Resident Evil: A Survival Horror Saga

As winter settles in, there's no better time to dive into the chilling world of Resident Evil. This iconic franchise has not only defined the survival horror genre but has also evolved significantly since its inception. From its early days with fixed camera angles to the immersive first-person experiences of today, Resident Evil has left an indelible mark on gaming culture. Let's explore the history, core appeal, and why this series is perfect for winter gaming.

Brief History: The Evolution of Horror Games

Resident Evil first graced our screens in 1996, introducing players to a terrifying world filled with zombies and other grotesque creatures. The original game set the standard for survival horror with its fixed camera angles, creating a sense of dread and tension that was palpable. As technology advanced, so did the series. The transition to 3D graphics and first-person perspectives in titles like Resident Evil 7: Biohazard brought a new level of immersion, allowing players to experience fear in a more visceral way. Each installment has pushed the boundaries of storytelling and gameplay mechanics, ensuring that Resident Evil remains relevant in the ever-evolving landscape of horror games.

Core Appeal: Resource Management and Terrifying Encounters

What sets Resident Evil apart from other horror games is its unique blend of resource management, puzzle-solving, and terrifying encounters. Players must navigate through meticulously designed environments, often with limited ammunition and health supplies. This scarcity creates a palpable tension, forcing players to make strategic decisions about when to fight or flee. The puzzles, often intricately woven into the narrative, challenge players to think critically while under pressure. The combination of these elements not only heightens the sense of fear but also keeps players engaged, making each encounter with the undead feel fresh and exhilarating.

Why It's Perfect for Winter Gaming

Winter is the ideal season for cozying up with a good game, and Resident Evil fits the bill perfectly. The isolation and dread that permeate the series amplify the cold atmosphere outside, making the experience even more immersive. Picture yourself huddled under a blanket, controller in hand, as you navigate through dark, snow-covered landscapes filled with lurking horrors. The chilling sound design and eerie visuals create an ambiance that is hard to replicate, drawing players deeper into the narrative. Pairing these gaming sessions with a selection of scary beers can enhance the experience, making for a memorable winter gaming night.

I’m a 31m, I’ve been single for 5 years. I’ve gone of dates, I’ve had a few flings during that time but nothing has ever stuck. I was previously in a 4 year relationship and after I took a long period to rediscover myself and focus on me, during that time I became a bit reclusive in the sense of not going out to bars or anything, and eventually quit drinking all together to focus on health. With that being said, I don’t go to bars much and so dating has been pretty hard as most connections start from places like Tinder or Hinge that don’t really go anywhere. But I’ve been really into one guy for a while, but I really honestly can’t tell if he’s mutually interested or he just wants to be friends. 

A smidge of background, after my relationship ended I high tailed it out of the city and moved back to my hometown, where options are more limited dating wise but things are more affordable and I had a support system. I reconnected with lots of people, and met a few new ones. One of the people I met is that exact guy, originally when we started chatting it was pretty generic, or sexually charged. That kinda went away with time, and we just kinda talked casually and occasionally. Somewhere in the last few months we started talking more, it’s never sexual, but he does seem interested in getting to know me. He’s not the best at messaging sometimes, where there’s longer interludes between messages, but we do talk daily now. He’s self admittedly bashful, and has told me before that he was afraid to talk to me at the gym because I’m “beautiful” and he thought I would be meaner, even though we had messaged off and on for awhile. We actually have a lot in common, we have birthdays a few days apart, he’s also been single roughly the same amount of time, we work similar jobs (I’m a nurse, he’s an occupational therapist), we have a lot of the same interests musically, hobby wise, movie and television wise, and also seem to generally enjoy a lot of the same things. I tried for quite a while to actually pin down a time to meet up for coffee or something to which he agreed finally and we met up at a local coffee shop for a few hours and just talked.

We literally both raced to try to pay for the orders (I won), and had a nice time, I’ve mentioned meeting up again and he is susceptible to it. We message everyday, he messages me good morning everyday and we talk periodically throughout the day. Sometimes some of the things he says I can’t honestly tell at all if he’s interested like that or just a really friendly guy, he’s very sweet, and very attractive. So sometimes I think I’m just reading it how I would like things to be perceived. I was originally going to move back to the city, so I wouldn’t have to commute 40 minutes to my job but also to try to be more social, he owns a house in our town, however I found a steal of a deal on a house here in town and put an offer in that was accepted, despite my fears of dissolving dating options (a large portion of city gays have a thing against coming to the burbs). I have kinda felt that after he found out I was looking at houses around here (a process I started months ago, looking both here and the city, with less in the city in the more recent months due to the cost difference and having aging family here) he’s seemed to be more open to doing things or communicating more. He does often ask me about my day, seems generally interested in my interests and what I have to say, and since meeting for coffee (which was a first time in person one on one encounter, excluding brief conversations at the gym) has said things about planning other things out or when I mentioned how I would love to go to the zoo or gardens (just generally) has stated that we could plan things like that when it gets warmer. He’s very easy to talk to, and I genuinely enjoy the conversation and look forward to seeing I have messages from him but since I’ve also been single for quite sometime, I’m off my game and have become quite accustom to how direct some guys (mainly fuckboys who never grew out of it, considering we’re in our 30’s now) are, it makes me second guess it. Basically can someone here help Stella get her groove back? Cause I’m not sure if I’m reading into things, over thinking, getting in my head, or barking up the wrong beautiful blonde tree. 

If I learned anything about myself as I’ve gotten older is while getting older has made me more confident and comfortable, I’m the best a flirting or charming and understanding a situation when it’s not something I’m actively trying to pursue, or I know it’s not going anywhere (we’ve all flirted just to flirt, or whatever) but I in actuality am just a weary idiot lol who doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing, and I’m basically a clueless teenager in a 30 something body.

i work opening shifts at a coffee house and am usually scheduled with two other people. we’re expected to clock in at 6.30 am, which gives us 30 minutes to get the store ready at 7. 

every tuesday and Thursday a close friend of mine picks me up in her car and we drive to work together. given it takes about 10-15 minutes to drive to work, she has a habit of arriving late thus making both of us late. personally it bothers me a little because a pet peeve of mine is when people don’t show up on time, especially when it comes to work, but i dont say anything if it since we’re very close friends. i have the option of taking the first morning bus to work, but she’s always offered to carpool. 

one tuesday morning i wake up and text her at around 5.50 am to see if shes awake, since she offered to carpool today. she usually takes abt 10 mins to respond so at this time I’m debating if i should take the bus. if i miss the first bus, ill arrive to work 30 mins late. i decide to wait it out and miss the bus so we can drive together. at 6.10 theres still no response so now I’m panicking because i already know we’ll be late. im the only one with the key to the store, so the third person opening with us will have to wait in the cold if I’m late. as a result i paid $14 to uber to work and by this time she responds with a “i just woke up,” to which i responded ”it’s fine, I’m ubering so that X coworker won’t have to wait outside.” 

upon arrival at the store, it turns out X coworker hasnt arrived either, and I’m the first one there. i open the store alone for 15 mins (\~6.45 am) and only at this time did my friend and coworker X arrive. i gave both of them the cold shoulder and didnt say anything because i was upset at their tardiness. for context, I’m a shift supervisor so i have other duties to carry out before the store opens, so when two of the other openers do not arrive on time, I’m burdened with the work of three people. i even cut my supervisor responsibilities in ways that are actually not allowed (which i won’t mention) just so we can open on time.

she could tell i was upset and we didnt speak for the first half of the shift. a little later she comes up to me an apologizes for wht happened. i appreciated it and told her not to worry about it, and that it‘s also partly because it’s a pet peeve of mine. i suggested to her that she can tell me the day/night before if she thinks she won’t be able to get up on time to pick me up. that way ill just bus to work and no one will be late; besides she‘s not obliged to drive me and i do feel bad for making her wake up earlier than needed. we made up by the end of it but there was obvious tension in the air still. 

fastforward to wednesday, i worked an opening shift again, and more than half of the employees scheduled arrived at least 15 minutes late to their shift. keep in mind the employees who show up late are always the same people. as a supervisor, this stresses me because all the breaks get pushed back quite significantly. to make matters worse, we had an anonymous store evaluation that day so the pressure what even greater for me. i worked a 14 hour day shift that day, back to back with my second job teaching kids. 

on wednesday night she messaged me saying she‘ll most likely be unable to wake up on time to pick me up for thursday’s opening shift because she went skiing during the day. i told her no problem I’ll take the bus, to which i did come thursday morning. in all honestly, i appreciated the heads up and communication from her side. 

but when 6.30 am comes around, both her and another different coworker haven’t arrived yet. i check her location to find out shes still at home. so on top of being extremely exhausted, I’m once again finding myself to be very triggered. the other coworker (call them Y) gave me a heads up saying she’ll be 5 minutes late (for context she always comes at least 10 minutes late so i expected it to a degree), but my friend did not say she will be late. i figured without needing the extra time to pick me up, she should be able to get to work on time. so i open the store alone for \~15 minutes and they both arrive at the same time. i give the cold shoulder again because i couldnt believe how upset this made me. 

at around 9.00 am, my friend comes to ask me if I’m ok, because i never not talk during work. she asks, “is this about me being late today? because in all fairness, i already did tell you the night before that i’d be late (not true btw, she said she won’t wake up on time to pick me up so not the same thing) so I’m not sure what else you want me to do.” to which i replied, “it’s not so much about today, but from Tuesday.” her response following sounded defensive and shocked, ”Tuesday?? still? i mean i can give you space if you want if it was about tuesday, but like i already did what i could about today so...i don’t know.” i didnt have the chance to reply to that so i shrugged, and left work early because my heart couldn’t handle the conflict. i cried a lot after lol.  

for the sake of having objective feedback, im leaving out how i felt in the moment. i think a bunch of things just snowballed out of proportion and to my friend, she only thinks about what happened on tuesday.

i don’t want to lose our friendship over this because i truly truly truly see her as one of my best friends. this is kind of our first serious conflict, and i wish to resolve it but don’t know what approach to take.

1qkkrge,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qkkrge/aitah_for_hating_my_bfs_brother/,AITAH for hating my bf’s brother,"My (25F) bf (28M) has a 33 year old brother that he’s very close with. His brother has never been in a relationship before. The reason for that is because he was very focused on work and hasn’t really met anyone he wanted to commit to. I never thought of this as a red flag, I just thought he was disciplined and had certain priorities in place. 

The longer we dated and the longer I knew his brother, the more I noticed things about him that I didn’t like. He stares women up and down, he can’t walk passed someone and not check out their backside (gross), he comments on women’s bodies and says stuff like “she doesn’t have the body to wear that dress”, basically he objectifies women a lot. His personal life is a wreck too, he’s been hooking up with someone who’s taken. All of this behaviour doesn’t match well with the “persona” everyone thinks he is. Almost everyone in the family/among friends calls him kind, sweet, very caring and I never deny those traits of his but how can someone like that be also so disrespectful towards women?

There have been two occasions that really made my blood boil. First was when we went out for coffee, me, my bf, his brother and some friends. The place we were at was packed and behind us was a table with many girls. When one of them stood up with her backside towards our table, his brother said “hey look behind you” out loud! He said that to my bf, with me sitting right next to him! The other guys immediately started laughing. My bf saw me feeling uncomfortable and said “don’t listen to them, they are jerks”, and I didn’t respond anything. I shut down but in my head I was thinking well why tf are you friends with jerks??? I felt very disrespected. 

Another occasion was when we were again with my bf, his brother and two of their friends. We were talking about different countries we visited and which one was the best, and his idiotic brother goes “Spain wasn’t something special but every woman there had a huge ass. Wherever I would turn my head, I saw bigggg butts”… Like okay creep no one talks like that anymore. I really don’t know maybe my generation is just more respectful in general but hearing that made me feel gross. It’s so vulgar! And I know guys talk about stuff like this, I’m not stupid. But I feel like when you have a woman among your friend group, maybe try to be a bit more respectful?? 

My bf doesn’t engage with comments like that. It’s not the first or only time his brother and some other friends objectified women or threw in some nasty comments in my presence, and each time my bf would just turn to me with a guilty look and hold my hand. So my bf knows I’m pissed off when things like that happen and that’s good enough, at the end of the day I won’t make him destroy his relationship with his brother and friends because of that. I just can’t seem to get over the shit his brother says/does and that stops us from forming a bond. Like it’s very apparent that I’m not close at all with his brother, despite me and my bf being together for over three years.

He told me that they have so much fun together and have amazing chemistry but that he does not find her hot and would not see her as a romantic partner. We talked about boundaries between friends and partners and I told him that I am okay with friends of the opposite sex so long as they don’t get to share his most intimate thoughts and emotions as a partner would.

Since then things have been going great between us but he never talks about her unless I bring her up. He’s started to tell me when they go on one-one-one coffee catch ups. But he hangs out with her in groups with other colleagues also.

Out buying some more water and I decided to look at every bottle on the shelf Volvic, Evian, Highland Spring, Voss, Fuji etc. Then happened across Ice Valley water 500ml and 2ltr bottles. Took a look at the back and this has a mineral content of 42ppm (dry residue at 180°C). Thought I was misreading this, checked on other bottles and packaging and is legit. 6 bottles (2ltr) packs cost £2.75 so that’s 12ltr. Tesco’s GB45 which is 120ppm is £1.50 for 5ltrs. So you get an extra 2ltrs with Ice Valley (if you buy the 6 bottles compared to two bottles of the GB45 5ltr) and less minerals, and you save 25p lol. Anyone else aware of this?

Made my first brew this morning using this water. I’m half asleep, but there is a slight more sweetness there. Though I can’t be sure. As I said am just waking up lol. I have stores of both types of water and will do more comparison over the weekend.

Just to note, I have really enjoyed my coffee with the Tesco GB45 water. Though can anyone tell me what I should expect with such a lower mineral count? I’ve added photos of both the label and the bottle’s mineral analysis for info.

Should/could I buy certain mineral drops to boost minerals? Guidance much appreciated.

I want to remain calm i really don’t want to be controlling, but at the same time I don’t feel comfortable with this because it occcupies my thoughts and I find myself wondering if he’s is with her right now. I haven’t met her yet but he has said he will introduce us. How do I approach this situation, leave it for now or bring it up? If I do how is the best way to approach this topic?

Sophia POV - Age 19

His mouth was hot, and his hands were everywhere — gripping, teasing, claiming.

I was spread out beneath him on his bed at the Devil Souls MC clubhouse shirtless, breathless, heart thudding so loud I couldn't hear anything else.

This was happening.

Blaze.

My Blaze.

The boy I'd loved since I knew what love was. The man I'd waited for, cried over, dreamed about.

And now... he was finally mine.

He growled as he dragged my panties down, the only piece of clothing left between us.

""You sure about this, baby?"" he asked, eyes searching mine, full of fire and something I wanted to believe was care. ""I won't stop once I start.""

I nodded. ""Please... I want it. I want you.""

His grin turned wicked. ""Then spread these legs and show me what I've been missing.""

I did. No hesitation. Because I trusted him. Because this was Blaze.

The second he saw what was between my thighs, he paused. His thumb swiped across my entrance.

""You're so tight. And wet."" He brought it to his lips and sucked. ""This all for me?""

My cheeks burned, but I nodded.

""Good girl,"" he murmured. ""I'm gonna ruin this vulva. it so good, no other man'll ever measure up.""

I believed him. I wanted that. I wanted every part of him.

He lined himself up, pecked me deep, and pushed in slow, deliberate.

I gasped, my fingers digging into his back. It stung, but God... it felt right.

""Breathe, baby. Let me in.""

And I did. I let Blaze Shaw have everything.

My body. My first time. My heart.

He stilled once fully inside me, forehead pressed to mine.

""Jesus, you feel like heaven.""

He pulled back, then slammed in hard. I cried out, clutching him, and he chuckled darkly.

""You like it rough, huh? I knew you were filthy under that perfect little act.""

And he wasn't gentle. He pounded me into the mattress, one leg slung over his shoulder, my cries echoing off the clubhouse walls.

When he shifted positions flipped me over, dragged me onto all fours, I lost any sense of composure.

""Look at you,"" he rasped behind me, smacking my hip before thrusting deep. ""This vulva's gripping me like it's starved. You were made for me.""

I screamed his name when I came. Hard. Clenching around him, tears in my eyes.

He pulled out, flipped me again, and without a word, dove between my legs.

""Didn't get enough,"" he growled, tongue flicking wicked circles over my cherry. ""Need to taste you falling apart.""

When I came again on his mouth, sobbing his name like a prayer, he climbed back on top.

""Still hard for you,"" he muttered. ""Gonna bang you again. Gotta make sure you never forget this.""

And he did. Twice. Until I was trembling, sore, and so full of him I could hardly breathe.

Later, wrapped in his sheets, I lay on his chest, drawing lazy circles over the Devil Souls ink across his pec.

""Blaze?"" I whispered.

""Mm?""

""You really meant it earlier... about me being yours?""

He pecked my hair. ""Yeah, baby. Always wanted you.""

I fell asleep believing that lie.

◆◆◆

I woke up a couple hours later, alone.

Blaze's bed was cold. The scent of intercourse and sweat clung to my skin, and the ache between my legs reminded me how real it all had been.

I stretched, pulled on his oversized shirt, and tiptoed out thirsty and maybe... hopeful I'd find him waiting in the kitchen with that cocky smirk and a cup of coffee.

The clubhouse was dim, voices low but audible from the common area beyond the kitchen wall. I crept quietly, pausing at the kitchen pass-through window.

I saw him. Blaze. Leaning against the pool table, laughing with the boys.

Joker's voice rang out first. ""So? Little stalker finally wore you down?""

Blaze chuckled. ""Guess so. Girl's been chasing me since she had braces.""

LEP whistled. ""Bet she woke you up with a blowjob and breakfast this morning.""

More laughter.

Ryder my brother added, ""Did she bring the coffee with whipped cream again? She always tries so hard.""

The words hit like knives.

Then Blaze, my Blaze dug the blade in deeper.

""It's not that bad,"" he said, cocky grin in full display. ""Basically, have my own personal assistant. Always ready to drop everything for me. Bends over backward just to be near me.""

Laughter exploded.

Storm cut in. ""You watch her like a starving man, Blaze. Admit it. You're obsessed.""

Maverick added, ""Distance makes the heart grow fonder, huh?""

But Blaze? He killed me. Again.

""She's not my type,"" he said easily.

Silence.

""She's got no boobs, too sweet, too soft. Acts like a puppy. Always eager. And don't even get me started on that fake confidence. You scratch the surface, and all you get is clingy virgin energy.""

The room howled with laughter.

I felt my heart split. Right there. Shattered like glass on the tile floor.

He knew. He knew I was a virgin. And still... he'd said that. In front of everyone. After banging me like I was everything.

My fingers clenched the countertop. My throat burned. But I wouldn't let them see me cry.

I stepped forward, eyes locked on his, voice clear.

""Funny... that 'clingy virgin' just had your shaft in her twice last night. You seemed to like my lack of boobs then.""

The room went dead quiet.

Blaze paled.

I smiled sweetly, bitterly.

""And don't worry about those heart-eyes LEP mentioned. They'll never be directed at you again. Because now? I see you, Blaze Shaw. You're not a man to admire. You're not someone worth loving. You're not even worth the dirt under my shoe.""

I turned to Ryder.

""And thanks for the backup, big bro. You really proved how much I matter to this club.""

No one stopped me as I walked out. And no one came after me.

By sunrise, I was gone. Packed. On a plane. Back to college. And this time, I didn't look back.

Six years passed before I set foot in Hallow Point again. Six years since Blaze Shaw took my first time and broke my heart in the same breath. Six years since I swore, I'd never love him again.

And yet, even now... I still wasn't sure if I'd forgiven him. Or if I wanted to set the whole clubhouse on fire.

Blaze POV - Age 16

From the outside, we were a perfect family. Sunday church. Freshly mowed lawn. Mom made cookies and Dad shook hands with the neighbours. Everyone thought we were happy. Loving. Normal.

They didn't see what happened when the door shut. When the smiles fell off our faces. When the mask slipped and inferno opened.

""Fking prick!""

The crash of a dinner plate split the air. I was halfway down the stairs, heart already in my throat. I crept lower, quiet, invisible — a trick I'd perfected. My ribs still ached from last week.

In the kitchen, my mom stood trembling, tears spilling down her cheeks. Sam Shaw's face was beet red, fists clenched.

""You let that biker sleep you?"" he spat, veins bulging. ""You think I don't know who the heck Tank is?! You think I don't see the way you glow when he's around?""

""Sam, please,"" Olivia whispered, eyes darting to the hallway. She knew I was there. ""It's not what you think.""

""Oh, it is. You dropped your panties for a leather-wrapped criminal. You let him defile you, and now you think you're gonna live under my roof and play wife?""

SMACK.

The sound cracked across my spine. I flinched hard. Blood sprayed across the fridge. Her lip was already swelling.

""That how Tank does it?"" he barked. ""Slaps you around before he bangs you stupid?""

I couldn't stay back. Not this time.

""Get off her!"" I stormed in, fists clenched, voice shaking.

Sam turned to me like I was a cockroach on his shoe.

""You defending your bimbo mother now?"" he sneered. ""Maybe that bikers shaft in your hip too.""

""You're a psycho!"" I shouted.

""You don't get to talk to me like that in my house.""

He took a step forward. I raised my fists. I shouldn't have.

The first punch landed on my cheek. The second in my gut. Then the belt came off. He whipped it across my back again, and again, and again.

""Ungrateful little prick!""

""Should've drowned you in the tub!""

""Maybe Tank'll take you too, since you love him so much!""

My mom screamed and tried to step in but he shoved her into the counter. She crumpled like paper, blood dripping from her scalp.

By the time it was over, I was in a heap on the tiles, breath shallow, skin raw and welted. My lip was split. My eye was swelling shut.

Sam lit a smoke and stepped over me like trash.

""Dinner better be hot by the time I come back down,"" he grunted. ""And wash your face. You look pathetic.""

I didn't cry. Not then. I went numb.

◆◆◆

By midnight, I was out behind the garage with a stolen bottle of Jack and a head full of rage.

He slept her. Tank. And she let him. And now Sam was using it like fuel, like permission to turn our house into a warzone.

I hated all of them.

Especially him.

I'd never even met Tank, and already I wanted to see him bleed. He'd touched her. Looked at her like something real, something soft and then disappeared, leaving us to rot in the aftermath.

I stood. Drunk on fury. I needed to break something.

The Devil Souls MC clubhouse was only a ten-minute bike ride. Everyone in town knew where it was — the loud compound with its barbed-wire fence and constant rumble of Harleys.

I stole a lighter from the gas station down the road and biked to the edge of the compound. They had a shed by the far fence half-covered in shadows, right near a big old tree. Too easy.

I climbed the tree, leapt over, and snuck up on the shed. So much rage filled my chest I couldn't even think straight. I doused a rag in the gas jug I found sitting beside the door and jammed it through the cracked window.

Flick. Flame. Boom.

It lit too fast. Way too fast. I turned, panic rushing like lightning through my veins.

And then

""What the heck""

A hand gripped my hoodie. I was lifted clean off the ground.

BOOOOOM.

The shed exploded. Debris flew. Heat burned my skin. And I was being dragged.

◆◆◆

I hit the clubhouse floor hard, surrounded by a dozen of the meanest-looking bastards I'd ever seen. Leather. Tattoos. Guns. And scars that told stories I didn't want to hear.

""What the heck were you thinking, kid?"" a deep voice growled.

""Check his pockets,"" someone else barked.

I kicked out. ""Don't touch me!"" I spat blood. ""You fkin' maniacs!""

""He torched the shed.""

""Is that gasoline on his shoes?""

I tried to stand, a dumb move. Another man shoved me back down.

The men circled tighter. One of them tall, dark beard, ciga/rette clenched between yellowed teeth stepped closer.

""I'm Thunder,"" he said flatly. ""President of this club. You lightin' on fire in my yard?""

I shrugged, blood dripping from my chin. ""Wasn't yours. Just the shed.""

""You got a death wish, kid? Who the heck even are you?""

""Maybe."" I stared him down. ""Where's Tank?""

The name hung in the air like a threat.

""He said, who the heck are you?"" a tall one demanded. Beard like steel wool, eyes like ice.

I spat blood. ""Ben Shaw.""

They all froze. Recognized the name.

""Olivia's boy?"" someone asked quietly.

The tall one — President maybe — narrowed his eyes. ""That makes your daddy Sam.""

""Yeah,"" I growled, ""unfortunately.""

Another man stepped forward from the shadows.

Tank.

I knew it was him. Broad shoulders, buzzcut, tattoos licking up his throat. And he looked at me like I wasn't a stranger.

""Kid,"" he said slowly, ""you really set that fire 'cause of me?""

""Screw you,"" I snarled, ""you touched my mother and then vanished like a coward. Now we're both bleeding out cause you wanted a quick intercourse.""

The silence was thick. Even the music in the clubhouse had stopped.

Tank's jaw flexed. ""I didn't know she was married.""

""Nonsense!"" I snapped. ""You knew. You just didn't care. You broke her marriage. Broke her spirit. You think Sam needs a reason to go nuclear? No but you gave him one.""

No one moved. They just... watched me bleed.

Thunder finally broke the silence. ""You're working here now.""

""What?""

""You're paying back the damage. Bar duty. Weekends. Scrub floors, clear tables, clean toilets. You don't like it, we call your daddy.""

""Fine,"" I muttered.

""Welcome to inferno, kid,"" someone laughed.

◆◆◆

Weekends became mine. Bar back. Glass runner. Clubhouse grunt.

And yet... I didn't hate it.

The noise, the chaos, the honesty of it all, it was better than silence and bruises at home.

Two weeks later, I knew all their names. Rusty. Skunk. Monk. Crash. Chainsaw. Snake. Quickshot. And the man who ruined my life, Tank.

I worked every Saturday and Sunday. Sweat. Cuts. Bruises. But I kept showing up.

Because slowly, it stopped feeling like punishment.

It started feeling like belonging.

Chainsaw let me ride his bike once. Skunk showed me how to bluff in poker. Thunder kept a close eye, but never unkind. Tank... watched from a distance. Always watching.

And then I met them.

Ryder. Storm. Maverick. A few years older than me. Already like little princes of the club.

Ryder was cocky. Storm was ruthless. Maverick was a grinning wildcard. They didn't treat me like a charity case. They challenged me. Accepted me. Made me bleed in the ring and laugh at stupid prick after.

And then there was... her.

Tiny thing. Barely Ten. Big blue eyes. Missing front tooth. Hair in messy braids.

She followed us like a duckling. Always with a notebook or a glittery crayon in hand.

""Ben,"" she lisped one day, tugging on my sleeve, ""you wanna see the bunny I drew? He's got sunglasses and a gun.""

I laughed for the first time in years. And I ruffled her hair.

""Sure, short stuff. Show me the bada/ss bunny.""

She beamed. Sophia.

""Ben!"" she beamed, gripping my jeans. ""Ryder says you're gonna get beat again in sparring!""

I smirked. ""Does he now?""

Storm laughed from across the yard. ""Sophia's got more balls than you, man.""

""Only cause hers haven't dropped yet.""

Sophia stuck her tongue out. ""You're gonna lose.""

I squatted down to her level. ""How 'bout I let you draw a tattoo on my arm if I win?""

Her eyes lit up. ""Deal! I'll make you a pink unicorn with a bazooka!""

And just like that... I smiled. Really smiled.

She was pure light. And I didn't deserve any of it.

Blaze POV - Age 18

The whole place reeked of sweat, whiskey, leather, and intercourse .

Music pounded through the clubhouse walls — dirty bass, filthy lyrics, and laughter loud enough to rattle your bones. Half-undressed women ground against patched-in brothers, moaning, giggling, getting taken against walls, over pool tables, or bent right over the couches like it was just another Saturday.

It was chaos. It was home.

And tonight? I wasn't just part of it.

I was one of them.

A fully patched Devil Soul.

Thunder stood tall at the front of the room, kutte in one hand, bottle of Jack in the other. ""Everyone shut up!""

The room roared before it hushed, anticipation thick.

I stood beside Ryder, Storm, and Maverick, my brothers all three grinning like I'd finally earned my crown.

""You've all watched this little prick bleed for us,"" Thunder growled. ""He scrubbed floors, took beatings, and didn't flinch when it got real. He earned his place.""

He threw the kutte across the room.

I caught it midair.

Rusty raised his drink. ""Ben Shaw is dead. Long live Blaze.""

Skunk whistled. ""For the little pyro prick who tried to burn down our shed.""

Everyone lost it.

Shouts. Glasses clinking. Laughter and cheers. Someone yelled to ""get him laid, twice over."" I couldn't stop smiling.

I slipped on the kutte. It was heavy. Final. Like armour tailored just for me.

For the first time since I was born, I felt like I belonged.

It'd been almost two years since I lit that shed on fire.

Two years since I walked out of that hellhole house and never looked back.

Olivia stayed with Sam. Despite everything. Despite the bruises.

""He's calmer now,"" she wrote once. ""Without you there to provoke him. He just needs peace.""

I never wrote back. Didn't have the words. Didn't have the forgiveness.

If Tank was my real father like she suspected... I didn't want to know. Not then. Maybe not ever.

The club was my family now.

Ryders cool under pressure, Thunder's golden boy.

Storm a brutal enforcer with a heart he pretended didn't exist.

Maverick, chaos in a leather kutte, but ride or die.

And then there was Sophia.

Ryder's little sister. Twelve now. All legs, glitter pens, and mismatched socks. She still followed us around like a shadow with a lisp and zero fear.

""Blaze!"" she sang one afternoon, waving a piece of paper. ""I made you a new tattoo! A fire-breathing wolf... with sunglasses!""

I chuckled, ruffling her hair. ""Gonna need room on my chest for that masterpiece.""

""I gave Ryder a bunny one.""

Ryder groaned. ""Jesus Christ.""

""She said mine bites harder,"" I grinned.

She looked up at me with those big blue eyes, full of adoration. Pure. Unshaken.

No one had ever looked at me like that before.

I kept my distance. Teased her gently. She was just a kid  and Ryder's kid sister. Off-limits, period.

But I'd be lying if I said I didn't crave the way she looked at me like I wasn't broken.

Back in the present, the party was insane.

Storm handed me a drink. ""You did it, man.""

I clinked his glass. ""We did it.""

Rusty hollered across the room, ""Where's that little stalker of yours?""

I flipped him off. ""She's twelve, you sick prick.""

""Give it a few years. She'll be breakin' hearts.""

He had no idea how close that hit.

◆◆◆

Later, the club bimbos descended like heat-seeking missiles.

One a curvy brunette straddled my lap, grinding without shame. ""Congrats, Blaze. Wanna unwrap your present?""

A redhead pressed in from the side. ""We come in pairs.""

I didn't say no.

I didn't even think.

Couch. Clothes off. Hands and mouths everywhere. Fast, hard, filthy the way I liked it.

The brunette moaned as she sank onto my manhood, her body clenching around me as she rode me without pause. I gripped her hips and thrust up hard, making her scream. The redhead pecked down my chest, biting my boobs before crawling between my legs. Her tongue flicked across my balls, wet and eager, while the brunette rode me like a queen.

I growled, dragging the redhead up by the hair. ""Switch.""

She climbed on, legs spread, taking me deep with a hungry moan. I pulled the brunette close, burying my face between her legs, licking her until she was trembling and gasping.

Their bodies tangled with mine, slick with sweat and want. They moaned for me, called my name, begged me not to stop.

I gave them what they wanted. All of it. Until I came with a roar, spilling inside one while the other pecked me breathless.

Somewhere across the room, I thought I caught a flash of blue eyes.

But when I looked again, it was just smoke and shadows.

◆◆◆

Shirt half-buttoned, I stepped outside into the cool night air.

Tank stood by the firepit, ciga/rette glowing.

He didn't speak, just watched the flames dance.

I joined him, letting silence settle between us.

""You did good tonight,"" he finally said.

""I'm not a kid anymore.""

""No. You're not.""

We didn't talk about Olivia. Or Sam. Or the rumours.

We didn't talk about how he might be my father.

We didn't talk about the fact that I'd spent the last year wondering if that was why he watched me so closely not with judgment, but guilt.

We didn't talk at all.

She died a year ago and left me alone to raise our little boy, scout. scout is all I have left.

scout is 6 now. We did our best to recover from the pain of my wife's death; a loss of a companion, a removal of a mother. I shudder to think my son has to face the bloody blade of life at such a young age. son needs to be sheltered from it, son needs protection.

And for a while, I thought I was providing that.

But that was before...that was before the nightmares started.

That was before Heavy.

I scrubbed sleep from my eyes, rolling in the darkness to check the clock. Three am. I groaned and pulled myself from the warmth of my sheets. scout was crying from her room, calling my name. he must have had a bad dream.

In a daze, blinking sleepily, I shuffled out of my room and down to hers. The house was silent and my feet scuffed over the cool hard wood floors. scout never has bad dreams, I thought, yawning. Did I let him watch something scary before bed?

I entered her room, the space illuminated by a pink ballerina night light, and went to my daughter's side. She was curled up in a ball with her hands over her face. She was sniffling and her pillow felt damp with tears.

Cooing, I scooped her up and told her everything was ok. After she calmed down some, I asked her if she had had a nightmare. She looked up at me with big teary eyes and nodded. She hugged me and asked if she could sleep in my bed. I told her of course.

“It won't come in your room?” scout asked me as I picked us both up off the bed.

I paused.

“man, what u talkin’ brub ?”

He wrapped herself tight around me and whispered, “The Heavy...”

I didn't know what to make of it, the phrase nonsense, and so I told her “dat was nah Fat geezer comahng ahnta da house a' dat we safe.“ I felt he relax against me as I walked us back into my bedroom. I laid her down in my bed and stroked her hair until I heard the soft snores of sleep. I laid down next to he and exhaled heavily. Sleep returned to me in a rush of heavy fatigue.

The next day, life resumed its predictable repetition. I got scout ready for school and then rushed to prepare myself for work. I left him downstairs in front of the TV, happily munching on some toast as I scurried to shower and shave. It was like this every morning, but I was used to the frantic pace.

As I threw my sports jacket on and bustled into the hallway to go downstairs, I paused. I bent down and wet my thumb with my tongue. I scrubbed it along the hardwood floor, wiping away a streak of dirt that ran towards scout's room. I grit my teeth and reminded myself it wasn't a big deal. he was 6 years old and couldn't be expected to remember to take off her shoes all the time.

Standing, I hurried down the stairs and collected my daughter to begin our day. I switched off the TV and grabbed scout's pink pretty  princess Barbie backpack, asking him if he had to go to the bathroom before school. When he said he didn't, I snatched the car keys off the kitchen counter and ushered her to the front door.

As I followed he out, I hesitated, my hand freezing before I closed the door all the way. I stuck my head back inside and listened. I could have sworn I had heard something from upstairs. After a second, I shrugged and closed the door, locking it tight.

The day passed like so many before it. The hands on the clock pushed forward triumphantly and finally announced the end of the work day. Not long after the trumpets of freedom were blown, I found myself at home once again. I ordered pizza for us, a rare delicacy to my son, and spent the evening watching children shows on Netflix. I barely saw the images on the screen, the fatigue from the day washing over me in heavy waves. A stomach full of pizza didn't help either.

Heather shifted and snuggled into me, resting her head against my chest. I smiled and kissed her shoulder, telling her that after this episode it was time for bed. She put up her usual resistance, but I battled it valiantly. That was something I had had to learn how to do. My wife had always been the one to say no. I was always the softy, allowing scout to get away with a multitude of activities. It was hard to say no to him, him Lowkey bahg grahllz,  softer jaw,  has a nose with innocent pleas. My heart melted every time and I would eventually cave, begging her not to tell her mother.

But after the brain tumor took my wife away from us, I had had to learn how to balance my daughter's requests with fatherly affection and parental standards. I thought I had found a reasonable balance. With each passing day I would discover another piece of the puzzle and take another step closer to becoming a functional single parent.

When the show ended, I told scout to go upstairs and brush him teeth and get ready for bed. Groaning, he obeyed and I began to pick up the kitchen. I placed our plates in the dishwasher and threw out the empty pizza box. I checked my watch and saw that it was almost eleven. I sighed, not realizing how late it had gotten. I should have put Heather to bed two hours ago. I exhaled. It wasn't the end of the world.

After the kitchen was clean, I turned off all the lights and made sure the front door was locked. Satisfied, I climbed the stairs and went to check on scout progress. To my delight, I found her already in bed and asleep. I went to her and gently kissed the top of her head, smiling to myself. He really was a good man like medic.

I turned on her night light and closed her door behind me. I went to my own room and prepared myself for bed. As I slid into the cool sheets, I decided that tomorrow after school I would take Heather to the park so he could ri his Barbie  bike along the community bike trail. Content with my plans, I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep.

Darkness. Haze. Groggy. I slowly peeled my eyes open in the black, head spinning. Why was I awake? What time was it? I rolled over and looked at the clock. Three am. I blinked and closed my eyes, deep drowsiness filling my body like hard liquor.

scout was crying. I forced my eyes open again. That's why I was awake. I pulled myself into a sitting position and scrubbed my face with the palms of my hands. Why was she crying? Another nightmare?

As I stood, I prayed that this wasn't going to turn into a regular thing. I stumbled around in the darkness and pulled my door open. I stepped out into the hall and paused, cocking my head towards the stairs.

I...thought I heard something moving downstairs.

Another wave of cries from scoutsr's room forced me back into motion and I shuffled down the hall and opened her door. The room was bathed in soft pink light, the tiny ballerina illuminating the walls with her glowing body. I went to my sonz and kneltz by herz bed, whispering softly that daddy was here a' eeasyghlytahnk was aahahght.

He wrapped her arms around my neck and hugged me tight, soft sniffles escaping he bubbling nose. I stroked her hair and asked he if she had had another nightmare.

She pulled away and looked up at me, her eyes brimming with tears, “Yes daddy, it was awful!” He cried, “And...and when I woke up...” he trailed off, struggling to get herself under control.

My eyes melted, “What ahs aht king?”

“When I woke up and the heavy was whispering in my ear!” She sobbed, collapsing against me.

I felt my stomach churn slightly. Prickles of unease rose along my arms like tiny mountains of fleshy fear. This was the second night in a row she had mentioned this Tall Dog. I didn't know what the hell she was talking about, what it was, but it was clearly bothering her. I wondered if someone at school had told her something or she had seen something scary on TV about a dog. Whatever it was, it was giving my daughter nightmares and I needed to find a way to make it stop.

Suddenly, Heather squeezed my neck and I heard her gasp. Before I could react, she buried her face against me and started sobbing even harder, her whole body shaking. Confused, I pulled her off me and cupped her face in my hands.

“What is it? What's wrong?” I asked urgently.

Heather pointed behind me towards the open door, “It just peeked around the corner and was looking at you!”

I spun around, my heart thundering. There was nothing there. Of course there was nothing there. Why would there be? Putting a hand over my chest, I forced myself to settle down.

“There's nothing there, honey,” I said, “It's just shadows. It's late, do you want to sleep in my bed again?”

Her eyes remained locked on open door as she slowly nodded. I picked her up and rubbed her back as I walked us out of her room. There was nothing to be afraid of. She had just had a bad dream. As I walked down the hallway, I paused in the darkness. I looked to my right, down the stairs, down into the gaping maw of black.

Did I hear something moving down there?

Heather squeezed me tight and whispered into my ear, “It's going into the basement.”

I shifted her weight in my arms, her words sending a shiver of unease down my spine. I told Heather there was nothing down there. I brought her into my room and tucked her into bed. I sat beside her and rubbed her head until she drifted off to sleep. It took longer than it had the previous night, but once she was breathing easy, I went to my bedroom door and stepped out into the hall.

In the dead of night, when surrounded by heavy darkness, fear has a way of making monsters out of the shadows. I forced myself to remain calm, reminded myself that I was an adult, and went and stood at the top of the stairs. I looked down, the enclosed staircase revealing nothing but the square black mouth at the bottom. I listened, holding my breath.

Silence. I shook my head, telling myself that I was being ridiculous, and went back to my room. I closed the door and lay down next to Heather. I stared at the ceiling, mind alert and awake. I knew I wasn't going to be falling asleep anytime soon.

I pulled my phone off the nightstand and brought up the internet browser. After taking a moment to think, I searched the term “Tall Dog”. I scrolled through some dog show sites that popped up and finally found a link to a message board. I clicked it.

My heart skipped a beat as I read the question at the top: **My son keeps having nightmares and complains about something called “The heavy”...does anyone know what the hell this is? It's happened three nights in a row! It's driving me crazy! Help!**

The top answer sent a chill rocketing through my body.

It read: **Your son is telling the truth! GET HELP! The heavy from tf2 is real and it will keep coming back! It's attracted to deep sadness and it won't leave your son alone until it gets what it wants! IT IS VERY DANGEROUS! I know this sounds insane but I'm telling you the truth! I've come across others who have encountered this thing! IT IS VERY REAL AND VERY DANGEROUS!**

I put my phone down and stared into the darkness. My heart was racing. This couldn't be true could it? Every part of me wanted to write it off as a bizarre coincidence, but it was so...specific, that I couldn't. What am I supposed to do with this information? I thought. This is crazy, stuff like this doesn't happen, doesn't exist.

And yet here I was, staring at a warning on my phone while my terrified daughter lay curled up next to me. It was unnerving. I turned on my side and stared at the closed bedroom door. Just outside the door were the stairs leading to the ground level. As I closed my eyes, I pictured something long and lanky pulling itself up them, its snout dragging along the wood. I forced the image out of my head and shivered.

There was nothing out there.

The next day, scout didn't mention anything about the nightmares and I didn't ask her. I wanted this to go away and bringing it up in the daylight didn't seem like it would help my cause. I prepared her for school and then got myself ready for work.

As we left the house, I realized just how tired I was. The lack of sleep last night was taking its toll on me and I made a metal note to stop and get more coffee after I dropped Heather off.

While I drove, my mind wandered back to the message board warning. In the daylight, it seemed a little silly. I pushed the fear back into the corner of my mind and scolded myself internally for being so irrational. I reminded myself again that I was an adult and didn't believe in monsters and things that go bump in the night.

After I dropped Heather off, I went and got another cup of coffee and then drove to work. My brain accepted the caffeine gratefully and as I sipped on the steaming liquid I pondered what my wife would make of the whole thing. She'd probably say I was being stupid and to man up. The thought made me grin and I suddenly missed her.

Eventually, I pulled into the office parking lot and began my day. Being Friday, I was hoping I could leave a little early, the crisp morning air a prelude to a possible beautiful day. I still planned on taking Heather to the park. I had hopes that the fresh air and sunshine would erase her nightmares, burning them away in a blaze of brilliance.

Well...things didn't go as planned.

Halfway through the day, I got a call from Heather's school. I sat, dumbfounded, as the principal told me I needed to come pick my daughter up. When I asked why, he informed me that Heather had started biting her classmates and wouldn't stop until a teacher forcefully pulled her off someone.

I closed my open mouth, shock erupting across my face. There had to be some kind of mistake, my daughter didn't do things like that! The principal assured me that he was just as surprised as I was, but that she needed to be taken home for the day. The other kids were scared of her and the parents were being notified.

Great, I thought, I'll be the single dad with the violent child. As soon as the thought popped into my mind I got angry with myself. Who cares what they think, I need to go see if my daughter is alright!

I informed my boss of the phone call and he nodded me out the door. I thanked him and told him I'd make it up on Monday before bolting for my car.

As I drove, I tried to make sense as to the possible reasons why Heather would act out like this. She wouldn't just do it! One of the kids must have been picking on her. One of them must have provoked her. She wouldn't just start biting kids.

I sat at a red light, anxiously drumming my fingers against the steering wheel. Something was going on with my daughter and I needed to get to the bottom of it. First the nightmares and now this. Clearly, Heather was going through something and as a responsible parent, I needed to find out what it was. I grit my teeth as the light turned green and I gunned the engine. I wondered if it had something to do with my wife. I wondered if this was Heather's way of coming to terms with her death a year later. I felt my eyes suddenly well up and my knuckles turned white.

It wasn't fair that she had been taken away from us. What had we done to deserve such sadness? What was going through Heather's young mind in the absence of her mother? What could I do to fill that sorrow?

And then I started to panic, the creeping thoughts of Heather's upcoming teenage years. What if this was the end of our good relationship? What if she started blaming me for her mom's death? I knew she was only five, but time has a way of preserving deep hurt and forming scars that never heal. I realized just how much I needed to be there for my daughter in these early years, these crucial developmental times. How I acted could make or break the way she viewed...everything.

As these thoughts scrambled my mind, I pulled into the school parking lot and was slammed with a realization that chilled me to the bone.

I remembered the message board warning: The Tall Dog is attracted to deep sadness.

I shook my head. No, don't start going down that road. That's insane and there's no such thing. She's forming waking nightmares in order to deal with what she's going through.

Steeling myself, I ran into the school.

Before I knew it, I was sitting in the principal's office listening to him apologize for making such a big deal out of this and that it was more for the other kids than for Heather. I barely heard him, nodding as his words washed over me in waves of numb noise.

Finally, a teacher led Heather into the room and I scooped her up in a big hug. I kissed her on the cheek and saw that she had been crying. I told her I loved her and that we were going to go home. She nodded silently at me, her big brown eyes filling with tears.

I told the teacher and principal that I was sorry for the incident and assured them it wouldn't happen again. They both smiled and thanked me, but I saw something else behind their masks of public decency. Judgment. They saw me as a single father with no idea how to raise a little girl. They saw a struggling man with no answers. They saw someone who had lost his wife and was still finding a way to live without her.

I suddenly got angry, a spike of adrenaline coursing through my veins, but I kept my mouth shut. I turned and left, hugging my daughter to me as I stormed out of the school. I didn't know if it was righteous anger or embarrassment and I didn't care. They had no idea what I had gone through, what I was dealing with. Who were they to judge me?

I put Heather in the car and drove us home in silence. I fought to get myself under control. I reminded myself that this wasn't about me, it was about my daughter. She was the one who needed help, she was the one who needed loving support.

We eventually arrived home and I checked my watch. It was almost four. I abandoned the idea of going to the park and instead sat Heather down on the couch. I placed myself next to her and told her I needed to talk to her about what had happened at school.

“Sweetie, are you doing ok?” I asked gently, gauging her mental state.

She looked at her hands and nodded.

I cleared my throat. I was always so bad at this.

“Is it true you bit those kids today?”

I saw her lip quiver and she slowly nodded without looking up at me.

I sighed, “Honey, you can't bite, you know that right? Why did you bite those kids?”

She shrugged again and I saw a tear roll down her cheek.

Be brave, I told myself, you can't back out now.

“Were you mad at them? Did someone say something mean to you?”

She put one hand in her pocket and slowly shook her head, eyes still downcast.

“Heather, can you look at me?” I asked softly.

She turned her eyes to mine and I saw she was crying openly now. She kept fidgeting in her pocket.

“Can you promise me you won't do it again?” I asked.

More tears ran down her cheeks and she cried, “I'm sorry daddy! I'm really sorry!”

I leaned down and kissed her on the head, “It's ok honey, I know you're a good girl. Daddy loves you. Just please don't bite anyone again ok?”

She sniffled back another outburst of tears and her hand kept twisting in her pocket.

I finally noticed and patted her leg, “What's in your pocket Heather? You have something you want to show me?”

She suddenly looked embarrassed and shook her head, but I prodded her and after some coaching she finally pulled out a handful of brown nuggets.

I blinked, wondering why my daughter was carrying around a pocketful of dirt and then my heart slammed so hard against my ribcage I thought it would break.

“Sweetie,” I said, trying to keep my voice under control, “Is...is that dog food?”

She balled her fist up and hugged the nuggets to her chest, staring at her feet that dangled from the edge of the couch.

“Where did you get that?” I asked, feeling a deep disturbance roll over me.

“I found them,” She answered quietly.

“And...and what are you doing with them in your pocket?” I asked, a flurry of nerves fluttering in my chest.

Heather looked up at me, “They taste good.”

I forced myself to breath and held out my hand, “Why don't you let me hang onto those and I'll make us an early dinner ok?”

Reluctantly, she handed over the nuggets and I plastered a smile to my face. I asked her if she wanted to watch some TV while I made dinner and she offered me a small grin and nodded sheepishly.

As I turned on her shows, I fought with the voice screaming in my head. Something was going on here. Something really really awful was happening to my daughter. I didn't know what exactly, but the past couple days seemed to mark a turning point in her behavior.

I started preparing dinner, begging myself to stop overreacting, but I couldn't shut it out. The nightmares, the Tall Dog nonsense, the biting, and now she was eating dog food? I didn't know what to do, didn't know what to say to her. I wanted to ask her about her mom, ask her if she had been thinking about her recently, but I was afraid to. I didn't want to open up a wound I couldn't close. What if she started asking questions I couldn't answer? What if her behavior got worse?

I began to wonder if I needed to take her to see a therapist. As the thought entered my mind, I violently slammed the door on it. There was nothing wrong with my daughter, she was just a vibrate little girl who had a few nightmares and bit a couple kids! So what! When I was her age, I'm sure I did things much worse and I turned out fine!

Yes but...what is the Tall Dog? What does that mean?

I shouted internally at myself to stop thinking about it. There was no such thing and I needed to face the problems I could handle.

I finished making dinner in mental agony and prepared two plates. I went to the couch and sat with Heather, both of us eating in silence as cartoon images danced on the screen.

When I woke up the Tall Dog was whispering in my ear...

I grit my teeth around my food. I wasn't thinking about this bullshit anymore.

I crawled into bed, mentally exhausted. It had taken me forever to get Heather to sleep. She had begged to sleep in my bed, but I told her no and I'd keep my door open in case she woke up scared. I didn't want her to start forming bad habits.

I rested my head against my pillow and stared out into the dark hallway from the crack in my door. I shut my eyes and said a silent prayer that Heather would sleep through the night. Maybe then all this would be over and she would go back to being the little angel I knew she was. I didn't want to continue down this road of parental speculation and continue assuming that every little bad action was a foretelling of a bleak future for her.

I let out a long breath and waited for the gentle arms of sleep to rock me into the world of dreams. It didn't take long.

My eyes snapped open, bloodshot and wide. I was soaked in sweat, the horrific nightmare still clinging to my brain with razor sharp claws. I rolled onto my back and wiped sweat from my face. I swallowed hard and waited for reality to clear away the cobwebs of slumber. My heart was racing and I put a hand over my bare chest, willing it to slow.

My wife. I had been dreaming about my wife. She had been in a hospital bed, screaming my name and clutching her head. I had been beside her, crying, begging her to tell me what was wrong, but she just kept screaming. I began to scream for a doctor and that's when I realized all the lights in the hospital were off and no one was in the halls. I kept screaming for help, pleading with my wife, until I finally heard a noise.

From the blackness of the hall, a doctor in a bloody lab coat came crawling into the room on all fours. His eyes were wild and he started barking at me, his mouth foaming. I backed away from him, shock and terror rising in me like a dark mountain.

The doctor lunged at me, teeth bared, and that's when I woke up.

I pulled my hands across my face, forcing the images from my head. What a horrible nightmare. I realized my stressed mind was probably mixing all my current worries into a terrifying night time cocktail, sneaking up on me and pouring it down my throat while I slept.

I looked over at the clock. Three am. I snorted, eyes wide, grateful that at least it was me instead of Heather who had woken up tonight. If I could take her fears from her, I would gladly. I just needed to be careful I didn't end up burning myself out.

As I rolled on my side to face my door, I heard something from downstairs.

Immediately, my mind exploded into alertness, the nightmare fear still fresh on my breath. I lay in silence, ear cocked and listening, my heart racing.

There.

It sounded like something was...walking around.

Get up, you have to get up, I thought, fear tingling my stomach. It's probably nothing, it's probably the house settling. Maybe Heather got up for some reason or is sleep walking.

I pulled the covers off me and swung my feet over the side of the bed. I jumped as I heard more movement.

What is going on...

Tense and terrifyingly nervous, I crept to the door. I paused, staring out into the empty hallway. I didn't hear anything.

I slowly opened the door and went out into the hallway.

Something was making noise at the bottom of the stairs. I balled my sweaty hands into fists and steeled myself. The house was impossibly dark, every corner filled with grinning black. The floor underneath my feet creaked as I slowly edged myself over to the top of the stairs.

I looked down.

And something was looking back up at me.

I stifled a scream, terror clenching my throat like an iron grip. My eyes bulged and my breath rushed from my lungs in a wave of cold fear.

It was long and slender, its hairless body a sickly gray color. It looked like a dog, but it was greater in length and bone thin. Its snout pointed up at me from the foot of the stairs, easily two feet in length. Its eyes were completely white and swollen in their sockets like bloated marsh mellows. It was on all fours, its front two legs resting on the first two steps.

As it gazed up at me, it began to pull itself upright. My knees turned to liquid and I watched in absolute horror as it rose to stand on two legs, its head towering towards the ceiling. Its neck was long, too long for a dog, and it snarled at me, its mouth full of black needle-like teeth.

It started slowly walking up the stairs towards me.

I backed away in frantic desperation, unable to comprehend what I was looking at. I tripped over my own feet and fell, not able to tear my eyes away from the advancing monstrosity. As it neared the top of the stairs it crouched back down on all fours and I saw its swollen white eyes pulsing with excitement.

I tried to scream, but found that I didn’t have the breath. It was the most terrifying thing I had ever seen and every alarm in my head was blaring with furious urgency. I scooted backwards with my hands into the safety of my room and stood, grabbing the door and slamming it shut in one violent gesture.

I stood with my back against the wood, sucking in hungry lungfuls of air. What the hell was that thing?! What was it doing in my house?! Where had it come from!?

Heather.

Oh no…

I pressed my ear to the door and heard footsteps pad down the hallway. Toward Heather’s room. I scrambled in the dark for some kind of weapon. I grabbed my discarded work pants that were lying in a pile on the floor and slid the belt from the loops. I wrapped it around my knuckles, turning the buckle outwards.

I went to the closed door and took a deep breath. I couldn’t let that thing hurt my daughter. I opened the door and stepped out into the dark hall. My eyes scanned my surroundings but I didn’t see it. I knew it had to be in Heather’s room.

I cautiously crept down the hall, ears trained to pick up any sound of the creature. Heather’s door was wide open and faint pink light drifted out from the inside.

I entered her room and froze. The monster, the Tall Dog, was on all fours by Heather’s bed. Its snout was inches from her ear and its mouth moved rapidly, but I couldn’t hear any noise. It was like it was speaking directly into her dreams. Heather’s eyes were shut but she had begun to stir, soft cries escaping her lips as the Tall Dog silently filled her mind.

Suddenly, it realized I was in the room and whipped its head around. Its eyes seemed to vibrate in their sockets, thick white pus leaking from the gelatinous, milky scleras. It silently bared its teeth at me, its mouth filling with sharp, ebony darkness.

I took a step back, feeling my throat tighten, and gripped the belt harder in my hand. I needed to get it away from Heather. My heart was seizing in my chest and my back was coated in a cold layer of sweat. I forced my knees to lock and I licked my dry lips.

The Tall Dog turned away from the bed and rose up up on two legs, towering over me. Despite its appearance, it didn’t move like an animal. Its balance was perfect and its legs and muscles twisted and flowed with the confidence of a human.

“What do you want?!” I whispered, holding my ground as a trickle of sweat slid down my face.

It leaped at me.

I screamed, raising my hands to protect my face as its long body crashed into mine. I fell to the floor, its sinewy flesh pressing mine to the wood. Its breath was hot on my face and stars exploded across my vision, my head bouncing on the ground. With the energy battered out of me, I blinked back darkness and scrambled desperately, trying to get it off of me.

It pinned me where I lay, its powerful legs digging into my sides. I looked up into its hideous face and the white ooze pouring from its eyes dripped into my hair.

It leaned down and opened its mouth, its jaws parting to reveal rows and rows of black teeth. I watched in horror as its throat began to open, folds of dark flesh parting like oil and water.

And then I heard my daughter screaming from deep down inside.

“Daddy help me please! Don't let it take me! Daddy please!!!”

Heather's voice was shrill with panic and it sent waves of chilling terror through my body. No, this wasn't happening, that wasn't my daughter, it couldn't be! Please God NO!

The Tall Dog snapped its jaws shut and I shoved it off of me, a surge of energy igniting my muscles. It skittered on all fours towards the open door and I scrambled to stand, breathing heavily.

“What did you do to her!?” I screamed, shaking in fear and fury. “What have you done to my daughter!?”

The Tall Dog crouched and eyed me, sniffing the air. I waited for it to strike, waited for it to move. This creature was going to kill me, I knew that, but I was ready. I stood my ground in the dim light, trembling, accepting whatever happened next.

Instead of charging me though, it turned away and sprinted down the hall. In shock, I listened to it crash down the stairs and onto the ground floor. More footsteps followed then faded and I realized that it was gone, leaving me shaking in horror.

I turned to Heather who lay motionless on the bed. I threw the belt onto the floor and went to her side, prayers flowing from my lips. Tears leaked down my cheeks as I grabbed Heather and lifted her head to rest on my lap. Her eyes were closed and her body was still.

“Please, God, I'm begging you, no, no, no!” I cried, my mind collapsing. “Heather, baby, my angel, wake up, daddy's here, please sweetie wake up!”

I shook her, pleading, drool and mucus bubbling from my face as reality tore my exhausted brain in two.

Suddenly, her eyes flickered and then she opened them. She stared up at me, blinking rapidly as if she wasn't sure where she was. I let out a cry of raw relief and hugged her tight against me, more tears pouring from eyes. I sobbed, rocking back and forth on the bed, clutching her to my chest. I thought I had lost her, I thought she had been taken away from me.

And then Heather began to bark.

My bloodshot eyes widened and I pulled her away to look at her face. Her eyes roamed around the room curiously and her tongue lolled from the side of her mouth. Drool leaked from her lips as she sat on my lap, panting. She finally looked up at me and let out a series of yaps, all signs of humanity draining from her eyes.

“Heather, stop it, stop that!” I cried, shaking her. “Don't do that! It's ok, its gone, its gone, sweetie!”

But she didn't stop.

She jumped from my arms and began to run in circles as if she were chasing an imaginary tail. She stopped and cocked her head at me, shouting a sharp bark as if she wanted me to play with her.

I sat on the bed, watching her, and gripped my face with sweaty hands.

I began to scream.

Heather will never be the same. That night, I rushed her to the hospital and begged the doctors for help. After examining her and bringing in a multitude of specialists, they informed me that she wasn't in control of her mind any longer. They told me she would never regain it. Something had been taken from her that couldn't be replaced or repaired.

I don't know how long they ran tests on her as I desperately expended all my options, desperate to try anything. I couldn't imagine a life without her. I couldn't image a life alone from her. I wept and prayed until I had nothing left to offer. Nothing changed, nothing helped, and I wondered if anyone even noticed.

And I know I have lost scout forever to it.

So now I stand here, in the darkness, over my daughter's bed.

I grip my 12 gauge double barrel shotgun with shaking hands.

Tears roll down my face and I beg   Einstein  to forgive me.

But whatever is laying in this bed...I know it's not my scout",1,1769153630.0,TwoIdiotGermans,0,1.0,False

He trapped me in his office, blocking the door.





""Five years, Quinn."" His eager eyes dragged over me.





""Wanna go again?""





I didn't even look up. Just grabbed my bag.





""Nope. Gotta pick up my kid.""





I wasn't pure enough, Jasper?





Good. You just made me your fucking nightmare!





...





The room went dead quiet.





Jasper froze. I tried to get off his lap.





He pinned me against the floor-to-ceiling windows, not letting me move.





That hungry look in his eyes? Gone.





Replaced by something cold. His usual cocky expression cracked.





He ground his teeth. ""How old is the kid?""





I stayed quie, then finally answered.





""Three.""





And we'd been broken up for five years.





This kid had nothing to do with him.





Obviously, Jasper knew that too.





I tried standing up again. This time, his hand let go.





As I reached the door, he spoke again, suspicion in his voice.





""Your file says you're single.""





I paused, steadied myself and turned back.





""Just got married recently.""





""Recently? And the kid's already three?""





I nodded, totally casual about it.





""Yeah. Shotgun baby.""





Jasper didn't say anything. His sharp gaze dropped to the cheap ring on my finger, and he let out a scoff.





I didn't give a shit, held my hand up right in his face.





The second I saw him about to lose it, I bolted.





That night, I collapsed on my couch and finally breathed out.





Sometimes? Lying is the best way to dodge a mess.





I'd grabbed that ring yesterday at a dollar store. Cheap. Effective.





I figured it was enough to kill whatever feelings Jasper had left for me.





Sure enough, next day my resignation got approved. HR came by personally to tell me.





One week to hand everything over, then I was out.





Normal resignations take a month. Mine? One week.





Not hard to figure out who pushed that through.





I nodded and started handing my work off to the new intern.





The new girl was sweet and eager. At least when I was training her, I never once paid for my own breakfast or afternoon coffee.





Right before clock-out, Wesley came up looking all apologetic.





""Hey Quinn, can I leave early tonight? My boyfriend's taking me to dinner.""





I hesitated—not because I couldn't let her go, but because I also needed to leave early to pick up my daughter.





When I didn't answer right away, she got anxious, pleading nonstop.





I gave in. ""Fine. Go.""





She lit up and immeditaly started packing her stuff.





""He''s on his way down now.""





I blinked. ""He works here?""





Wesley smiled all mysterious. ""Not exactly, he's—""





A deep, magnetic voice cut her off.





""You ready?""





Chapter 2





I froze.





If I'd never heard that voice before, I probably would've looked up out of sheer curiosity.





Too bad I knew it all too well.





For five years straight. In every nightmare.





On those nights when I couldn't sleep without pills, every damn word he'd ever said played on repeat in my head.





""Quinn, you're too innocent. I'm gonna ruin you.""





""Quinn, try smoking. Girls who smoke are hot. I wanna see a different side of you.""





And I fell for his coaxing and the teasing.





Sophomore year, I went from chasing Jasper to his booty call.





Eventually, I beat out all the other girls, and became his girlfriend for three whole years.





The day he accepted my confession, the weather was trash.





Howling wind, gray skies.





He'd just finished a date with a senior and dropped her off.





His car was parked right outside the girls' dorm.





Leaning on that little special treatment just for me, I went down and confessed.





For a second, even the wind seemed to stop. Like the world hit pause.





I waited.





Jasper turned to look at me, pulled out a cigarette and held it to my lips.





His eyes were dark—deep, dangerous, impossible to look away from.





Somehow, I leaned in and took it between my lips.





My mouth brushed his fingers, but he didn't pull away.





That teasing look softened into permission.





All he said was, amused.





""Good girl's not so good anymore.""





At the time, I was too far gone to get what he really meant.





Not until graduation—the last time he took me to a hotel, the last time we ever saw each other.





After we fucked, he handed me a cigarette like always.





""When I get married? I'm not picking a girl who smokes after sex.""





I swallowed hard. ""Why?""





Jasper smiled, smoke curling from his fingers. His tone dead serious.





""Quinn. I want someone pure.""





Tears burned in my eyes. I forgot how to breathe.





Pure.





He wanted someone pure.





Funny thing was, he used to say I was too pure, too good—





That it made me untouchable.





Now I finally got it.





Once I stopped being good? I became just another fuck toy.





Chapter 3





I snapped out of the memory, face blank again.





Wesley spun around, and practically skipped over to him.





Then she suddenly turned back, eyes worried.





""Quinn, aren't you picking up your daughter too? We can give you a ride.""





I opened my mouth to refuse, but Jasper cut me off—





He picked up my bag and strode straight toward the parking lot, leaving me zero chance to argue.





The car ride was weird as hell.





Silent except for Wesley chattering away.





Jasper tapped the steering wheel casually, barely responded to her.





But his eyes kept flicking to me in the rearview mirror.





Maybe sensing my awkwardness, Wesley tried small talk.





""Quinn, when you work late, does your husband pick up your daughter?""





I froze at the word ""husband,"" taking a beat to process.





Then shook my head. ""He's out of town. Not around much.""





She nodded like that made sense, but her eyes landed on that dollar-store ring on my hand.





""Is that your wedding ring? It looks kinda... faded.""





""Like one of those cheap ones you get online for ten bucks.""





""Oh! I didn't mean it like that. Don't get me wrong.""





Wesley turned around fast, apologizing.





But I caught the subtle sneer and that smug little superiority.





Fair enough. Her Hermès bag was worth more than my entire wardrobe.





I was about to say something when Jasper laughed.





He reached over and ruffled her hair, grinning with indulgence.





""You didn't say anything wrong—no need to apologize.""





Then his eyes met mine in the mirror, voice casual but pointed.





""Poor people love their pride. You're gonna piss someone off at work if you keep talking like that.""





He said it to Wesley.





But he really meant it for me.





A warning wrapped in fake concern.





I looked out the window and ignored him.





I'd heard this shit a thousand times when we were together.





That I wasn't good enough for him. I admitted it—our worlds were too different.





My family wasn't poor. But we were solidly middle-class.





The Hawthornes? Old money. Power. Connections at the top.





When we first got together, Jasper made it clear.





""Quinn, you can be my girlfriend. But you'll never be my wife.""





I knew. I always knew.





So I kept my feelings in check. Never crossed a line.





But when things got serious? I couldn't help it—I started hoping.





What if it worked out?





So right before graduation, I asked to see him.





He picked me up early that day.





The car stopped somewhere quiet on campus. The driver got out, waiting a few steps away.





I got shoved down in the backseat.





I was on top of him. His hands gripping my hips.





Sunlight filtered through the trees, blinding me.





An hour later, Jasper was leaning back, shirt damp with sweat.





I watched him and finally asked.





""Jasper... do you love me?""





I didn't ask if he'd marry me. I just wanted to know if he'd ever loved me at all.





He looked at me, playful eyes rare with seriousness.





""We're graduating soon.""





And at that moment, I understood.





Graduation was coming.





Time to break up.

The first date went well we went to a restaurant then a bar. He asked me out on a second date the day after for the weekend coming. On the second date we met in the city and walked around, had lunch then went to a bar. We didn’t kiss on either.

Toward the end of the second date I was trying to break the ice as I felt there wasn’t much conversation flow. I can’t remember how it exactly started but we started speaking about how I want to be a therapist one day so I started pretending to be a therapist asking him what he struggles with, he wanted it to be hypothetical at first then he said he struggles with social anxiety and explained how he wouldn’t have the confidence to approach a woman. He said ‘obviously I asked you out but that was over text.’ I felt kind of deflated at this point. He also said he feels like he takes it too slow sometimes (this would make sense).

Anyways I asked him out on a third date the day after no response for a day so sent another message then he apologised said he didn’t get the message and that he can find a date. No message for 2 days so I asked him if he found one and he suggested coffee and walk so I said yes. No message for a day so I suggested a day and time on the weekend, he responded the next day ‘unfortunately I’m busy both days this weekend, next weekend looks free for me though!’. I always see he silenced his notifications. He also never messages asking his my day is.

On the dates he’s polite and pays for everything but the lack of communication isn’t great. Should I speak to him in person and explain? What do you think of him?",1,1769153207.0,aspergirls,5,1.0,False

1qkkdrj,https://i.redd.it/gg7e6vl7w1fg1.png,Letters Over the Fence,"Monday night Diane found the letter.

When Gary came upstairs after locking the doors, she sat on the edge of the bed—pages in her lap, face pale, eyes dry yet wide.



She held up the doctor’s note first. “Who is this for?”



He didn’t answer.



She lifted the handwritten page. “Who is D?”



Silence hung thin and brittle.



“How long?”



Gary exhaled. “Since June.”



She laughed. “Since the new neighbor moved in. Of course. She’s sick. Cancer. And you… you’re going to her appointment. Tuesday.”



Gary nodded once.



Diane closed her eyes. “You love her.”



Another nod—smaller.



She opened her eyes. Tears now—silent, steady.



“Di—”



“Don’t.” She stood. “I’ve known something was wrong for months.



The late nights. The showers. The way you looked at me sometimes like you were apologizing without saying it.



I told myself it was stress. Work. Midlife. Anything but this.”



Gary’s throat worked. “I never wanted to hurt you.”



“But you did.” She wiped her cheeks. “You chose this.



Every time you crossed that fence. Every time you wrote her. Every time you came home and pecked me with her on your skin.”



He had no defense.



————————



Gary Harlan had lived on Maple Drive for seventeen years, long enough that the rhythm of the street felt like his own heartbeat—steady, predictable, almost inaudible. The house was the same one he and Diane had bought right after the wedding: two stories, white siding, black shutters, a front porch that still creaked in exactly the same places. Diane kept the flower beds perfect, the lawn mowed in neat diagonal stripes, the mailbox painted every spring. She still called him “honey” when she handed him his coffee in the morning, still pecked his cheek before bed like it was part of the nightly checklist. He loved her for it the way you love gravity: necessary, familiar, invisible until something threatens to pull you off the ground.



That something arrived on a Saturday in late June.



Gary was in the garage, sorting through boxes of old tools he swore he’d organize one day, when he heard the low growl of a moving truck backing into the driveway next door. The house had stood empty for eight months since the Millers moved to Florida. He’d gotten used to the quiet—no barking dog, no kids’ basketball thumping against the garage door at dusk. He wiped his hands on a rag and stepped out to look.



She backed the U-Haul down the drive with surprising confidence for someone who looked like she belonged on a magazine cover rather than behind the wheel of a twenty-foot truck. Dark hair pulled into a loose ponytail, sunglasses perched on her head, tank top the color of summer peaches. When she climbed out, stretching her arms over her head, the hem of her shirt rode up just enough to show a sliver of smooth stomach and the waistband of black yoga pants slung low on her hips.



Gary realized he was staring.



He cleared his throat, crossed the lawn, and leaned against the shared fence—six feet of weathered cedar that had always felt like enough separation.



“Need a hand?” he called.



She turned, smiled—slow, easy, like she’d been expecting the question. Up close she was even more striking: full mouth, sharp cheekbones, eyes the color of dark honey. Late thirties, maybe forty. No wedding ring.



“I think I’ve got the heavy stuff covered,” she said, “but if you want to save me from herniating a disc with the couch, I won’t say no.”



Gary laughed—surprised at how easily it came. “I’m Gary. Next door.”



“Donna Rinn.” She extended a hand over the fence. Her grip was firm, warm. “Just Donna. No one calls me anything else unless they’re mad at me.”



“Nice to meet you, Just Donna.”



She grinned. “Likewise, Gary-next-door.”



They spent the next hour hauling boxes and furniture. She directed, he lifted. Conversation stayed light: where she’d come from (Chicago, by way of a divorce settlement and a fresh start), what she did (freelance graphic designer, mostly book covers and album art), why Maple Drive (quiet, affordable, close enough to the city for occasional escape). Every time she bent to pick something up, the tank top shifted, revealing the curve of her chest or the line of her spine. Every time she laughed at one of his dumb jokes, her head tilted back and her throat moved in a way that made his mouth go dry.



Diane appeared on their porch around noon, wiping her hands on a dish towel.



“Gary? Lunch is ready—oh.” She spotted Donna and smiled the polite, practiced smile she used for new neighbors, church acquaintances, anyone who might one day need a casserole. “You must be the new neighbor.”



“Donna,” she said, wiping sweat from her brow. “And you’re Diane, I’m guessing?”



“That’s me.” Diane glanced at Gary, then back at Donna. “Welcome to the street. If you need anything—sugar, a spare key, recommendations for the best pizza—just knock.”



“Thanks. I appreciate it.” Donna’s gaze flicked to Gary for half a second—long enough to make his stomach tighten—then back to Diane. “Your husband’s been a lifesaver with the heavy lifting.”



Diane’s smile didn’t falter. “He’s good at that.”



They exchanged a few more pleasantries. Diane invited Donna to the neighborhood block party in August, Donna promised to bring wine. Then Diane disappeared back inside with a final “Don’t let him talk your ear off.”



Donna waited until the screen door clicked shut.



“She seems nice,” she said quietly.



“She is.” Gary rubbed the back of his neck. “Best person I know.”



Donna studied him for a moment—really looked, like she was reading something written in small print across his face.



“Good to know,” she said.



They finished unloading the last of the boxes. She offered him a cold bottle of water from a cooler in the truck. Their fingers brushed when he took it. Neither of them pulled away immediately.



“Thanks for the help, Gary.”



“Anytime.”



She smiled again—that same slow, knowing curve of her lips.



“I’ll hold you to that.”



He walked back across the lawn feeling the heat of her gaze on his back the whole way. Inside, Diane had set the table: turkey sandwiches, chips, iced tea. She asked about the new neighbor. He answered in short sentences—friendly, divorced, seems nice. Diane nodded, satisfied.



That night Gary lay awake beside her, listening to the soft, even sound of her breathing. The ceiling fan turned lazy circles overhead. Outside, crickets sang in the dark.



He kept seeing Donna’s smile. The way her tank top clung when she lifted a box. The brief press of her fingers against his.



He told himself it was nothing. Just a new face on the street. Just curiosity.



But when he finally closed his eyes, it wasn’t Diane’s familiar shape beside him that filled his mind.



It was the house next door, the light still burning in the bedroom window he could see from his own, and the woman inside it who had looked at him like she already knew exactly what he wanted—and wasn’t afraid to give it to him.



He didn’t sleep for a long time.



The next morning, when he went out to get the newspaper, he found a small envelope tucked under the welcome mat. Plain white, no stamp, his name written in neat, looping handwriting on the front.



\*Gary—\*



\*Thanks again for yesterday. You made moving day a lot less miserable. If you ever want to borrow a cup of sugar… or just talk without the risk of casseroles… my back door’s usually unlocked after dark.\*



\*—Donna\*



He read it twice, standing barefoot on the porch while the neighborhood woke up around him.



Then he folded it carefully, slipped it into his pocket, and went back inside before Diane could ask why he was smiling at nothing.



The fence between their yards had always felt solid.



Now it felt like paper.



...



The letter stayed in Gary’s pocket all Sunday like a live coal. He felt it every time he moved—when he mowed the lawn in neat overlapping rows, when he helped Diane carry groceries in from the car, when they sat on the couch watching a cooking show neither of them really cared about. Diane curled against his side the way she always did, her head on his shoulder, one hand resting lightly on his thigh. He tried to focus on the screen, on her warmth, on the ordinary comfort of it all. But the folded paper burned against his hip, and every few minutes his mind drifted back to Donna’s handwriting: neat loops, confident slant, the casual invitation that wasn’t casual at all.



\*My back door’s usually unlocked after dark.\*



He didn’t go over that night. Or the next. Or the one after that. He told himself it was nothing—just a friendly gesture from a new neighbor. People said things like that. It didn’t mean anything.



But he started noticing her more.



Monday morning he saw her through the kitchen window while he poured coffee: Donna on her back patio in running shorts and a sports bra, stretching against the railing. Long legs, the flex of her calf as she pulled one foot behind her, dark hair swinging loose. She caught him looking—lifted a hand in a small wave, then turned so her back was to him and bent forward into a deep stretch. The shorts rode up. Gary’s grip tightened on the mug until his knuckles whitened.



He turned away before Diane came downstairs.



Tuesday evening Diane was at her book club. Gary stood at the grill in the backyard, flipping burgers he didn’t particularly want, when he heard the gate latch click. Donna stepped through wearing cutoff denim shorts and a loose white T-shirt knotted at the waist. Bare feet. A bottle of red wine in one hand, two plastic cups in the other.



“Smells good,” she said, crossing the grass. “Mind if I crash?”



Gary glanced toward the house—windows dark, Diane wouldn’t be back for hours—then back at Donna. “Sure. Grab a chair.”



She set the wine on the picnic table, poured two generous glasses, and handed him one. Their fingers brushed again. This time she let the contact linger a beat longer.



“To new neighbors,” she said, tapping her cup against his.



“To surviving moving day,” he replied.



They sat across from each other at the weathered table. Conversation started safe: the neighborhood’s quirks (Mrs. Carter’s yappy terrier, the HOA’s endless rules about mailbox colors), her plans for the yard (herb garden, maybe a small fire pit). But the wine loosened things. She asked about his job—accountant, corporate tax, nothing glamorous. He asked about hers—graphic design, freelance, she loved the freedom but hated the feast-or-famine paychecks.



“You ever get tired of it?” she asked, swirling her wine. “The routine. Same office, same numbers, same… everything?”



Gary looked down at his glass. “Sometimes. But it’s steady. Diane likes steady.”



Donna studied him over the rim of her cup. “And you? Do you like steady?”



He met her eyes. They were darker in the fading light, almost black. “I used to think I did.”

I have nearly no functional family to rely on, and bc of that friends essentially ARE my family. 

I had no friends for nearly the entirety of my childhood years until junior yr of HS. After that, I carved my way into making plenty of friends, especially in college and now never want to go back to how lonely I once was. I had a boyfriend too, everything felt set until we broke up. 

But I'm terrified about how things will change for me as an adult, as everyone else around me will start to get into relationships, we will all be moving away for jobs one day, etc. I want to carve out a future for myself where I have people to just ""hang out with"" and not always ""catch up with"" behind a mask. I feel so filthy for admitting I want to see friends multiple times a week. Keep having close ones come over as if they're just casual family. I just want to maintain genuine human connection, not the fake catching up over coffee stuff (unless if it's a new friendship!). 

My grandma has a friend like this, and she says it comes off as needy. But what else are we supposed to do when family is not an option? When we don't have a partner? Is wanting companionship so wrong? Wanting to grow old with a friend if I cant find a partner is bad? 

I want a partner eventually one day too. But with how damaged I feel, I wonder if I'll ever get to the point of ever having a partner again. I never get any male attention, but people socially at least seem to be drawn to me. My friends always say I'm the type to make friends wherever I go. Idk.",3,1769152900.0,AutisticAdults,3,1.0,False

I have a severe peanut allergy. Not like oh I get a little itchy severe. Like trace amounts can put me in the hospital severe. My husband and I agreed a long time ago that our house is completely peanut free. No exceptions. Everyone in the family knows this.

The problem is my MIL. She loves peanuts and has never taken my allergy seriously. Shes always saying stuff like just dont eat them or youre being dramatic.

 Ive asked her multiple times not to bring peanuts into our home and she keeps doing it anyway.

Last week my husband was out of town and she showed up unannounced with a bag of roasted peanuts. I told her she needed to leave them outside or in her car. She ignored me walked right past and opened the bag in my living room.

I was scared honestly. If any of that residue got on the couch or the coffee table or anywhere I could touch it I could end up in the ER. This isnt me being paranoid this is just how bad my allergy is.

I didnt know what else to do so I called the police.

 Explained that someone was in my home with something that could cause me serious harm and refused to leave or get rid of it. They came and she ended up being taken in for questioning.

She said  I shouldve just waited for her to leave and cleaned everything after. But I dont think she understands that cleaning isnt enough. Cross contamination is real and this stuff can kill me.

Ive told MIL so many times. She knows. She just doesnt care. I felt like I had no other option.

Our manager asked the team to come up with solutions for this ongoing problem we have with client communication. I spent a few nights putting together a framework that I thought could actually help. Nothing crazy but I put real time into it.

The day before the meeting I mentioned it to my coworker Melissa over coffee. We usually bounce ideas off each other so I didnt think much of it. She seemed into it and was supportive.

Then the meeting happens. Manager asks for suggestions and Melissa immediately starts presenting my framework. Like almost word for word what I told her. Didnt mention me at all. Just talked about it like it was her own thing.

I sat there for a second kind of in shock honestly. Then I just interrupted and said something like actually thats something Ive been working on I can walk everyone through it.

Room got awkward and  Melissa looked annoyed. But my manager let me take over and explain the whole thing.

After the meeting Melissa came up to me and said I embarrassed her and made her look bad in front of everyone. Said I shouldve just let it go because were all on the same team and credit doesnt really matter.

But it does matter to me. Especially because Ive seen her do this to other people before. This was just the first time she did it to me directly.

1qkk8jy,https://i.redd.it/no3rnc2qu1fg1.png,My Stepbrother’s Forbidden Debt,"“Mom, I have incredible news! My study abroad application was accepted. I’m going to Paris!”  
  
Isabelle Ashcroft’s voice cut through the quiet of the living room, bright and hopeful, yet trembling with barely contained excitement.  
  
On the sofa opposite, her mother, Claire Valdemar, nearly jumped to her feet. Her eyes lit up with pure joy. “Already? That was so fast! When do you leave?” she cried out, her heart pounding at the thought of her daughter flying so far away.  
  
“In ten days,” Isabelle answered, her own heart a frantic mix of thrill and dread.  
  
Claire’s delighted expression faltered for a second, a shadow of worry crossing her face. “Ten days? That’s practically tomorrow! I’ll begin packing for you immediately! This is your first time going overseas, sweetheart. I can’t help but be anxious. Listen, I contacted an old friend of mine. Her son is living in Paris right now. If you need anything at all, you must reach out to him. You two were practically betrothed as children! Maybe you’ll even like each other. If it leads somewhere, wonderful. If not, you’ll at least have a friend there.”  
  
Isabelle gave a small, tight smile and nodded. “Alright, Mom. That sounds fine.”  
  
Claire blinked, taken aback by her daughter’s easy agreement. “Belle, you’re really okay with that? Does this mean… you and that boyfriend of yours are finally over?”  
  
The air in the room instantly turned heavy and still.  
  
Isabelle felt her stomach plummet.  
  
Her stepfather, Thomas Cortez, sensing the shift, slammed his hand down on the coffee table, his gaze fierce. “That boy never once had the decency to meet us! He was never serious about you! Good riddance, I say!”  
  
“Boyfriend? What boyfriend?” A new voice, cool and sharp, sliced through the tension.  
  
All three of them turned.  
  
Asher Cortez was walking through the front door, his presence immediately dominating the space.  
  
Dressed in a fitted black shirt and trousers that highlighted his tall, lean build, he moved with a careless, predatory grace.  
  
Isabelle’s heart gave a painful thud. She stood up automatically. “Ash,” she whispered, a confusing rush of warmth and fear flooding her.  
  
Asher acknowledged her with a dismissive grunt. He tossed his car keys onto the entryway table with a clatter and started up the stairs without a second glance, an aura of icy detachment surrounding him.  
  
That night, Claire prepared a feast. The smell of roasted herbs and garlic filled the house. She opened a bottle of deep red wine.  
  
Beaming, she raised her glass. “A toast! To celebrate Belle’s soon—”  
  
Isabelle, panic flaring, cut in quickly. “Mom, this wine tastes off. Is it spoiled?”  
  
Claire frowned, confused. She was sure it was perfectly fine. But before she could argue, Isabelle had already pulled her into the kitchen, pretending to search for a different bottle.  
  
“Mom, please don’t say anything about Paris to Ash yet,” Isabelle hissed, her eyes wide and pleading.  
  
At first, Claire didn’t understand.  
  
Then she remembered how fiercely protective Asher had always been of Isabelle over the years. She assumed it was just a brother’s love, a simple dislike of goodbyes. She nodded in agreement.  
  
After pushing food around her plate for a few minutes, Isabelle excused herself and fled to her room.  
  
She washed up, changed, and climbed into bed. The day’s events churned in her mind until exhaustion finally pulled her under.  
  
At exactly midnight, the mattress dipped beside her.  
  
A familiar, solid warmth pressed against her back. She felt the heat of his breath on her neck, then the soft, deliberate brush of his lips against her skin. The cool, damp touch shocked her awake. Her heart hammered against her ribs.  
  
Her body went rigid. She shoved him away and sat up, her voice sharp. “Asher!”  
  
“What’s wrong?” he asked, his lips curling into a lazy, dangerous smile in the dark. “Now that they’re trying to marry you off to some stranger, I’m not allowed near you? After everything we’ve shared, you think you can just leave?”  
  
Isabelle saw the misunderstanding but didn’t correct him.  
  
The silence grew thick and suffocating.  
  
Asher’s expression darkened. He reached out, his arm like an iron band, and pulled her back against his chest. “Isabelle, have I ever made myself clear? You don’t get to have a boyfriend. You belong to me.”  
  
Feeling the relentless heat of his body seeping into hers, all her arguments died in her throat. Instead, she lied softly, “I’m on my period. I don’t feel well.”  
  
The excuse seemed to temper him, though a scowl remained. “Didn’t it just end? It’s back already? Fine. I won’t touch you tonight. Just sleep.”  
  
He wrapped his arms around her, holding her so tightly she could barely breathe.  
  
She listened to the steady rhythm of his breathing, but sleep wouldn’t come.  
  
No one knew her boyfriend was her stepbrother, Asher.  
  
When she was twelve, her mother married into the Cortez family, weaving her life irrevocably with Asher’s, the family’s sole heir.  
  
By fourteen, their bond had deepened, a picture of perfect sibling devotion to the outside world.  
  
At eighteen, he found her secret diary, every page scribbled with his name. He leaned against her desk, reading it with a wicked grin. When she tried to grab it back, he caught her wrist and pressed a teasing kiss to her burning cheek.  
  
At twenty, they crossed the line for the first time. From that night on, their connection became a secret, addictive spiral.  
  
By day, they were siblings. By night, they shared a bed, hidden from everyone.  
  
Isabelle had always been the good girl. Being with Asher was the one wild, reckless choice of her life.  
  
She loved him so desperately she convinced herself their secret was okay. They could run away to another country one day. They could marry in secret, far from judgment.  
  
That fragile dream shattered two weeks ago.  
  
It was pouring rain. She had rushed to bring him an umbrella. Just as her hand touched the door to the private room he was in, she heard his friend’s voice.  
  
“Ash, what’s the deal with your stepsister? I thought you were just having fun before dumping her. Why is it still going on?”  
  
Another voice chimed in. “Yeah, you only got with her to get back at her mom for replacing yours, right? Don’t tell me you’re actually falling for her.”  
  
Isabelle’s world stopped.  
  
He wasn’t with her out of love. It was revenge. A twisted, cruel game.  
  
Her face went cold. Her mind emptied. Her body began to shake. But she stayed rooted to the spot, desperate to hear his answer.  
  
Then, his voice, cold and utterly devoid of feeling, reached her.  
  
“If I don’t play the long game, how will I make it hurt enough?”  
  
Laughter echoed from inside the room.  
  
She stood frozen outside the door, a wave of icy horror washing over her.  
  
He didn’t love her. Calling her his girlfriend, sharing her bed night after night—it was all a calculated act of vengeance against her mother for taking his mother’s place.  
  
Her mother still had to live in this house. Isabelle couldn’t let this become a scandal.  
  
After days of agonizing, the only solution she could see was to run. To leave this house. To leave him.  
  
That’s why she applied to study abroad.  
  
Now, only ten days stood between her and her escape.  
  
Glancing at the countdown on her phone, Isabelle carefully pried Asher’s arm from around her waist.  
  
A moment later, it was back, heavier than before. She removed it again. It returned again, stubborn and possessive.  
  
Frustrated, she finally grabbed a spare pillow and shoved it firmly between their bodies.  
  
This time, he didn’t move.  
  
Isabelle finally found a sliver of peace.  
  
She knew their story was almost over.  
  
Soon, she would no longer be his.  


Chapter 2

The sharp buzz of Isabelle's phone alarm cut through the quiet morning at exactly eight o'clock, jolting her awake.  
  
She opened her eyes.  
  
The space beside her in bed was empty and cold.  
  
A knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach.  
  
They had a rule, a secret pact forged years ago out of fear of their parents finding out: Asher would come to her room at midnight and leave before five in the morning.  
  
For five years, this hidden rhythm had defined their nights.  
  
Soon, everything would change.  
  
They would go from being secret lovers to just being siblings in public.  
  
The idea that he wouldn't need to sneak into her room anymore left a hollow feeling inside her.  
  
She got dressed quickly and went downstairs.  
  
Her heart was pounding.  
  
When she entered the living room, she stopped short.  
  
A woman she didn't know was sitting on the sofa.  
  
Her mother, Claire, saw her and beckoned with a bright smile. ""Izzy, come here! This is Ash's girlfriend. Be a dear and get our guest some water, would you?""  
  
Chloe Valence stood up, offering a hand.  
  
Her smile was wide and warm, complete with perfect dimples.  
  
""You must be Ash's sister! I've heard so much about you. It's lovely to finally meet you,"" she said, her voice cheerful and friendly.  
  
Isabelle's hands felt unsteady.  
  
She glanced at Asher, who was watching her silently from across the room.  
  
She didn't say anything.  
  
Instead, she turned and walked toward the kitchen to get the water.  
  
As she was filling a glass, Asher walked in.  
  
He moved behind her, his arms sliding around her waist, pulling her back against him.  
  
He leaned down and kissed the side of her neck, his lips soft and familiar.  
  
""Don't,"" she said, pulling away. ""She's right there in the other room.""  
  
Asher's mouth curved into a smirk.  
  
He kissed her lips, a quick, teasing touch. ""Are you jealous? I should have told you. She's just an old friend who's been living overseas. She just got back. My dad's been on my case about settling down, so I brought her over to get him off my back. It's nothing real.""  
  
""You know who my real girlfriend is,"" he added, his eyes holding hers.  
  
Isabelle listened, her face carefully blank.  
  
She gave a small, indifferent shrug.  
  
Her reaction seemed to surprise him.  
  
A flicker of confusion passed over his features.  
  
He had expected more of a fight.  
  
He had expected to see that old, familiar hurt in her eyes.  
  
In the past, if another girl so much as looked at him, Isabelle would get quiet and sad.  
  
She would cry when she thought he wasn't looking.  
  
When he'd ask her what was wrong, she'd shut down, refusing to say a word.  
  
He'd have to spend hours coaxing the truth out of her.  
  
She believed their love was wrong, something the world would never accept.  
  
The idea of openly calling him her boyfriend felt impossible.  
  
So she never confronted him.  
  
She never showed her anger.  
  
She just swallowed it down and suffered alone.  
  
But today, faced with the same situation, she was disturbingly calm.  
  
It unsettled him.  
  
Before he could say anything else, Isabelle picked up the water glass and walked past him, back into the living room.  
  
During breakfast, the family sat around the table as usual.  
  
Chloe took the seat next to Asher.  
  
They talked and laughed easily, sharing stories from when they were kids.  
  
Their comfort with each other was obvious.  
  
When Asher learned Chloe liked her eggs soft, he slid the sunny-side-up egg from his own plate onto hers.  
  
She smiled up at him, a blush coloring her cheeks.  
  
Instinctively, Asher looked over at Isabelle, waiting for a reaction.  
  
She was staring intently at her own plate, her head bowed as if she hadn't seen a thing.  
  
When she finally looked up to reach for a napkin, Asher quickly picked up the egg and took a big bite, a challenging grin on his face.  
  
At that exact moment, Isabelle's eyes met his.  
  
Without a word, she set her fork down and stood up from the table.  
  
Chloe noticed her leaving. ""Izzy, are you going out? Ash and I were planning to go into the city. Wait for us! We can all go together.""  
  
Isabelle was about to say no when her father, Thomas, spoke up. ""It's raining cats and dogs out there, Isabelle. Let Asher drive you. Your mother and I would worry if you went out alone in this weather.""  
  
With her father's insistence, Isabelle couldn't refuse.  
  
She walked toward the garage, her mind racing.  
  
She was going to the visa application center.  
  
If Asher drove her, he would know.  
  
He would find out she was planning to leave the country.  
  
She thought about it for a second, then let the thought go.  
  
So what if he knew?  
  
Her plans were made.  
  
There was nothing he could do to stop her now.  
  
A few minutes later, Asher and Chloe joined her in the car.  
  
To Isabelle's surprise, Chloe climbed into the backseat with her, trying to make conversation, clearly wanting to be friendly.  
  
Isabelle wasn't in the mood to talk.  
  
She gave short, vague answers as the car pulled out onto the wet street.  
  
The rain beat heavily against the car windows, a constant, drumming sound.  
  
Chloe leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a whisper meant only for Isabelle. ""I know you don't like me. And I know you and Ash are more than just brother and sister. But let me be honest with you. You two have no future. Ash has feelings for me, whether he says it or not. Trust me, if I wanted him, I could take him from you. Just like that.""

Chapter 3

Isabelle’s heart hammered against her ribs.  
  
A sharp spike of anxiety shot through her.  
  
She glanced sideways at Chloe.  
  
Chloe’s eyes held a mischievous sparkle.  
  
With a deliberate, theatrical motion, she pulled out her phone.  
  
She set an alarm, her movements exaggerated.  
  
It felt like a scene from a cheap soap opera.  
  
The shrill alarm pierced the car’s tense silence exactly one minute later.  
  
Chloe immediately pretended to answer a call.  
  
Her face crumpled into a mask of distress.  
  
Tears shimmered in her eyes as she looked toward the front seat.  
  
“Asher!” Her voice quivered with fake urgency. “It’s the housekeeper! My kitten is terribly ill! I’m so scared. Please, you have to take me home right now!”  
  
Asher’s jaw tightened.  
  
He pulled the car to the curb, his gaze fixed on the pouring rain outside.  
  
He turned, his expression conflicted.  
  
But seeing Chloe’s tear-stained cheeks, his resolve seemed to waver.  
  
His eyes flicked to Isabelle, searching her face.  
  
“I’m driving Izzy to the west side. It’s the opposite direction. You’ll have to get a cab,” he said, his tone firm yet edged with something softer.  
  
Chloe’s eyes widened in panic.  
  
She thrust an umbrella into Isabelle’s hands without a word.  
  
Isabelle looked from Asher’s strained face to Chloe’s pleading one.  
  
Her throat closed up.  
  
She couldn’t speak.  
  
Silently, she pushed the car door open and stepped into the storm.  
  
The rain was a cold, punishing wall.  
  
It soaked her within seconds.  
  
The old umbrella was full of holes; water dripped steadily through, plastering her clothes to her skin.  
  
No taxis were in sight.  
  
She gave up, clutching her bag over her head.  
  
She broke into a run, her shoes sloshing through deep puddles.  
  
The rain stung her skin.  
  
—  
  
She finally stumbled into the visa office, a dripping, shivering mess.  
  
Her hair was plastered to her face, her clothes heavy with water.  
  
Even after the long, tedious visa process was complete, her luck held.  
  
No cabs.  
  
With a sinking heart, Isabelle began the long walk home.  
  
The rain never let up.  
  
Another hour passed in a blur of cold and exhaustion.  
  
By the time she crossed her own doorstep, a deep, bone-chilling weariness had set in.  
  
A fever began to burn through her.  
  
Her body ached as if she’d been beaten.  
  
She collapsed onto her bed, the room spinning.  
  
That night, fever dreams tormented her.  
  
A monstrous shadow chased her through dark corridors.  
  
She woke drenched in cold sweat, gasping for air.  
  
The monster’s face shifted, morphing into Asher’s.  
  
He was cradling her, holding a glass of medicine.  
  
His voice was uncharacteristically gentle. “Come on, sweetheart. Drink this. You need to get better.”  
  
For a confused moment, Isabelle leaned into his warmth.  
  
Was this real, or another cruel dream?  
  
She swallowed a few sips of cool water.  
  
Then darkness pulled her under again.  
  
—  
  
When consciousness returned, the fever’s grip had loosened.  
  
She turned her head instinctively, expecting to find him beside her.  
  
The other side of the bed was empty.  
  
Cold.  
  
Lonely.  
  
Her phone buzzed persistently on the nightstand.  
  
She picked it up with trembling fingers.  
  
A group chat with Asher’s friends was exploding with messages.  
  
“Ash, your dedication is next level! You ditched a billion-dollar deal because your ‘little sister’ had a fever?”  
  
“Seriously, man. I’m starting to believe it. He ran every red light to get to her. Has he actually caught feelings?”  
  
“Looks like it. That wasn’t acting. That was panic.”  
  
At the very bottom, Asher’s reply froze the blood in her veins.  
  
“Feelings for her? I’d rather die. I’m just playing the part perfectly. I want her utterly devoted. That way, the fall will be so much harder, won’t it?”  
  
Each word was a knife twist.  
  
Five years.  
  
Five years of her life, her love, reduced to that.  
  
“Over my dead body.”  
  
“You’re cruel, Asher,” she thought, a numb exhaustion washing over her.  
  
Her hand fell limp.  
  
The phone slipped from her fingers and thudded onto the bed.  
  
The bedroom door creaked open.  
  
Asher walked in, holding a fresh glass of water.  
  
He saw her awake, saw the phone.  
  
His casual mask slipped for a second.  
  
He moved quickly, snatching the phone from the sheets.  
  
A flicker of nervous tension crossed his face.  
  
“What did you see?” he demanded, his voice tight.  
  
Isabelle kept her eyes downcast.  
  
Her cheeks felt hot. “Is there something I shouldn’t have seen?” Her voice was a hoarse whisper.  
  
Why was he still doing this?  
  
Didn’t he know she was already his, heart and soul?  
  
Why keep up the pretense?  
  
Hadn’t he won? Wasn’t she miserable enough?  
  
Misreading her silence as sickness, Asher sat on the bed and pulled her into his arms.  
  
His warmth was a familiar, painful comfort.  
  
“It’s nothing bad,” he murmured into her hair. “I was planning a surprise. I didn’t want to spoil it. Since you’re upset, I’ll tell you now.”  
  
He leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. “I did some research. Sweden allows marriage between non-blood-related siblings. Izzy, let’s go there. Let’s get married. I’m already making the arrangements.”  
  
They had whispered this dream to each other in the dark so many times.  
  
Hearing it now felt hollow.  
  
Instead of joy, a cold, dead calm settled over Isabelle.  
  
She knew the truth.  
  
There was no future.  
  
In ten days, it would all be over.  
  
The finality of it pressed down on her, heavy and suffocating.

Chapter 4

Isabelle finally felt strong again.  
  
Her first priority was clear.  
  
She needed to calculate every penny the Cortez family had ever spent on her.  
  
She sat at her desk, her bank card beside her.  
  
The task was overwhelming.  
  
She started listing every expense from the past ten years.  
  
Tuition, rent, food, clothes.  
  
The numbers added up quickly.  
  
Her heart pounded as the total grew.  
  
Five million dollars.  
  
The inheritance from her father and their old house were worth over three million.  
  
Her savings from part-time jobs weren't enough.  
  
She was still short by about a hundred thousand dollars.  
  
The truth was harsh.  
  
She couldn't leave yet.  
  
She needed a job to close that gap.  
  
Isabelle was a photography student.  
  
She saw a chance.  
  
With new energy, she posted her services online.  
  
She offered to take photos for any occasion.  
  
Her phone started buzzing almost immediately.  
  
Eight clients contacted her.  
  
They wanted wedding photos, graduation pictures, everything.  
  
She said yes to every single job.  
  
She worked from sunrise to sunset.  
  
The exhaustion was heavy.  
  
Sometimes it was hard to even stand.  
  
But she never complained.  
  
Her mother, Claire, had told her the truth.  
  
Thomas was already divorced when they met.  
  
He had kept it quiet.  
  
Claire and Thomas had a strong relationship.  
  
Isabelle was never a homewrecker.  
  
That label didn't fit her.  
  
Neither she nor her mother ever wanted the Cortez family's money.  
  
As Isabelle planned to leave, she thought of Asher.  
  
She didn't want him to keep hating her mother.  
  
Claire would stay with Thomas.  
  
That was why Isabelle had to repay the debt.  
  
After six hard days of work, she had saved just over five thousand dollars.  
  
She was starting to worry.  
  
Then, luck changed.  
  
A new client called.  
  
They offered her a job for a birthday party.  
  
The pay was over thirty thousand dollars.  
  
But there was a condition.  
  
The birthday girl was very picky.  
  
She had to be completely happy for Isabelle to get the full payment.  
  
Isabelle needed the money fast.  
  
She agreed without hesitation.  
  
On the day of the party, she arrived with her camera.  
  
She saw faces she knew.  
  
A sharp pain hit her chest.  
  
There was Chloe, wearing a princess dress and a tiara.  
  
Asher stood beside her in a sharp black suit.  
  
Asher frowned when he saw how tired Isabelle looked.  
  
""Why are you doing jobs like this?"" he asked. ""I thought you wanted to be a great photographer. Didn't the family take care of your expenses?""  
  
""I'm an adult,"" Isabelle said, her voice calm. ""I like this work. So I took the job.""  
  
Asher's expression darkened.  
  
He looked like he wanted to say more.  
  
But Chloe stepped in, her voice sweet.  
  
""Asher is just worried about you, Izzy,"" she said. ""He doesn't want you to work too hard. Please, don't upset your brother.""  
  
Chloe took Isabelle's arm.  
  
She led her into the party.  
  
She said she wanted to see Isabelle's photography skills up close.  
  
Chloe was polite, but Isabelle got no rest all night.  
  
Her finger was constantly on the shutter button.  
  
After about five thousand photos, Chloe still wasn't happy.  
  
She asked Isabelle to go upstairs for a shot from above.  
  
Isabelle's heart felt heavy.  
  
Her equipment was even heavier.  
  
She went up to the third floor.  
  
She set up her tripod.  
  
She aimed it at the stage below.  
  
Through the lens, she saw Asher walk onto the stage.  
  
The crowd cheered.  
  
He carefully placed a necklace around Chloe's neck.  
  
It was rumored to be a precious Cortez family heirloom.  
  
Chloe smiled brightly.  
  
She looked triumphant.  
  
She glanced up at Isabelle on the third floor.  
  
Then she threw her arms around Asher.  
  
Isabelle felt bitterness wash over her.  
  
She knew Chloe was putting on a show just for her.  
  
All night, Chloe stayed close to Asher.  
  
She made sure everyone saw them.  
  
She offered him sips of her champagne.  
  
She pulled him onto the dance floor.  
  
Guests whispered about a possible engagement.  
  
Chloe pretended her legs hurt.  
  
She asked Asher to massage them.  
  
Isabelle's memory cards filled with countless intimate pictures of their act.  
  
She felt herself going numb.  
  
She watched them embrace.  
  
She quickly pressed the shutter.  
  
She captured the moment.  
  
As she prepared to take another shot, Chloe stood on her toes.  
  
She pressed her lips against Asher's.  
  
Isabelle's hand froze.  
  
Her vision blurred, then cleared.  
  
She focused through the lens.  
  
In the high-resolution viewfinder, Asher looked surprised.  
  
But within seconds, his arm went around Chloe's waist.  
  
He cupped the back of her head.  
  
He deepened the kiss.  
  
The intensity of it left Isabelle breathless.

Chapter 5

“Oh, look at the happy couple!”  
  
“Seems like I’ll be toasting at my son’s wedding soon!” Thomas’s voice thundered from behind, jolting Isabelle out of her thoughts.  
  
She flinched, then quickly raised her camera, capturing several shots of the evening’s pivotal moment with practiced ease.  
  
The pair on stage soon separated, Chloe blushing as she waved toward Isabelle on the third floor.  
  
“Izzy, thanks for all your hard work! That’s enough for today!”  
  
Isabelle finally let out a long, slow breath of relief. She packed her gear, descended the stairs, and took her place beside Claire and Thomas.

The air conditioning runs strong to maintain infection control standards; corridors stay breezy; temperature shifts between wards are constant. Amidst all of this, thin scrubs struggle to provide comfort in the cold. That’s where smart, well-planned **winter scrubs tips** can make all the difference.

Anyone who has been on their feet through a full shift knows that comfort can make or break your day. When scrubs feel good, you’re able to show up fully for the patients you’re caring for. That’s the idea behind [**Mafatlal Healthcare’s**](https://mafatlalhealthcare.com/) designs, practical at their core, but still cosy enough for those late-night rounds.

# Why Scrubs Can Feel Colder Than Expected

[**Scrubs**](https://www.amazon.in/Mafatlal-Antimicrobial-sleeves-Scrubs-suit/dp/B0FWXKDX67/ref=sr_1_9?crid=2Q6ZGOV1T7X0I&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.AsmeFDrRmpFHGc8fxVnbXQ9mJYVz1pEI5TUmOg4_etH_pTbnsF5jC2bCKkbPfwd04Lo1YyXPTYLgo61IVLMy8HpDETt0SPC91SAUseR3mcjE64hqbJVDLg2SfWtgAOxs7P59U5W_EWa1i1Hf69SSu7tjcm7rKj-BqS2X2q5YqzaTGuxYgNczmGyFM68EHiawiYl3qpqBVv775VYBfZKUDqVj6qMIOeuFaHmgVD_LkzWYLjI66VN8Vkxs93LAMZaTvyf2FVK_SZaSAdJPWoF5N095AlfPsCZXseAQS68pZcY.28yuoJ68RfJVxzKKdDCiFuHpm4kjO6pcYjAsNHG7EWA&dib_tag=se&keywords=mafatlal%2Bscrubs&qid=1768632015&sprefix=mafatlal%2Bscrubs%2Caps%2C498&sr=8-9&th=1) are intentionally designed for breathability, fast drying, and hygiene. Those strengths become weaknesses once temperatures drop.

Light fabrics allow cold air to pass through. Constant walking in hallways, long hours at station desks, and continuous movement between temperature-controlled rooms increase exposure.

That’s precisely why professionals often feel chilled even before their shift reaches peak demand.

Understanding this limitation is the first step to applying **hospital cold weather gear** correctly and keeping yourself warm throughout long working hours.

# Layering: A Practical Shield Against the Cold

The most reliable solution is layering, not bulky jackets, but sleek thermal additions approved for clinical environments.

Base layers such as long-sleeve undershirts help maintain body warmth without altering the functionality of scrubs. Winter scrubs tips can make shifts a lot more bearable when the temperature drops. 

Fabrics that keep you warm but still let sweat escape are the ideal combination. And instead of piling on bulky layers, a simple underscrub that fits close to the body keeps the heat in without getting in the way of hygiene rules.

By **staying warm, nurses** and many healthcare workers say that they feel less distracted during long rounds and can focus on their job efficiently.

# Fabric Choices Matter More in Winter

India’s climatic diversity adds another challenge, winter in Delhi is not the same as winter in Mumbai.

Regardless of the city, a slightly thicker scrub fabric makes everyday tasks more comfortable. Poly-viscose or poly-cotton blends retain warmth better than feather-light materials.

[**Mafatlal’s**](https://www.mafatlals.com/) UniChoice brand offers stretchable, durable fabrics that are suitable throughout the year, with the option to add layers when temperatures drop.

These scrub layers are anti-microbial with built-in protection against bacteria. That’s especially helpful when the fabric sits close to your skin- every bit of hygiene support counts when you’re working around vulnerable patients.

**Choosing the right hospital cold weather gear ensures both comfort and safety during demanding shifts.**

# Scrubs and Lab Coats: Warmth Without Compromising Professional Appearance

Some hospital roles demand a polished look. A scrub serves as a medical-grade solution that adds insulation without breaking dress codes.

Lab coats are commonly worn across clinical settings for both protection and convenience. A well-designed coat, such as those from Mafatlal Healthcare, offers practical storage and a neat, structured look while adding an extra layer of warmth.

# Don’t Ignore Lower-Body Warmth

Scrub trousers are often lightweight by design, and legs can lose warmth quickly. Wearing thermals or fitted base layers beneath [**scrub bottoms**](https://www.amazon.in/Mafatlal-Antimicrobial-Poly-Viscose-Professional-Comfortable/dp/B0G2B7NFQ8/ref=sr_1_8?crid=1K4K7BXTH2ET1&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.eAqWwIVD1wa8wvwQDI4B3loZhCBTLciASpK8Be_CQ9IgGmIph5h0LI4TbGJcfhh1.cwfBDIyhkCTER38i-aEdQ0ckMu0DLX1LesN0YEYjEcI&dib_tag=se&keywords=mafatlal+under+scrubs&qid=1768632087&sprefix=mafatlal+under+scru%2Caps%2C401&sr=8-8) can make a significant difference, especially on night shifts or in critical care units where temperatures are often lower.

Such **winter scrubs tips** are particularly relevant for nurses, who spend long periods standing, lifting, and moving between cold wards.

Warm legs lead to better circulation, promising better performance.

# Choose the Right Socks and Shoes to Keep Feet Warm

Anyone who’s spent hours walking on cold floors knows how quickly the chill travels up from the feet. Choosing warm socks and shoes that really support you can make a big difference when the workday gets long. Many healthcare staff rely on this simple step to stay focused during busy shifts.

These are practical **winter scrubs tips** that ensure you are prepared for every step of patient care.

# Fit Influences Warmth Too

Poorly fitted scrubs, too loose or too tight can worsen discomfort. Loose fabric invites cold air; overly tight fits leave no room for thermal layers. A balanced, ergonomic fit helps retain heat and maintain mobility.

Brands specialising in healthcare apparel provide sizing built to support real working conditions. Mafatlal’s UniChoice brand offers male and female fits aligned with Indian body profiles, improving both warmth retention and comfort during high-movement roles.

# Warmth Beyond Clothing: Something You Must Not Ignore

When you’re rushing from one task to the next, the movement itself helps keep the cold away, even if you don’t notice it happening. A slow stretch while documenting or a quick walk across the ward can be enough.

In addition, take warm drinks- whether tea, coffee, or soup in between to keep yourself hydrated. It offers a quick comfort boost during short pauses. If you’ve ever gone too long without a break, you know how quickly your body feels cold and lethargic. A warm drink or a quick snack can make those cold wards feel far less draining. Pair that with the right uniform, and winter shifts become a lot more comfortable.

Together, these simple habits support your external **hospital cold weather gear** and make colder hospital settings easier to manage.

# Commute Smoothly Into the Shift

If you arrive at work already cold, it becomes harder to adjust once inside. Wearing insulated outerwear and gloves during transit prevents unnecessary discomfort. Once indoors, a scrub jacket or lab coat maintains steady warmth.

Strong thermal preparation before a shift is another crucial way of **staying warm as a nurse** or any other medical staff working in hospitals and clinics.

# Mafatlal’s UniChoice: A Trusted Brand Designed for Real-World Hospital Conditions

The capability to endure long, cold-leaning shifts is not accidental. It is built into design choices- stronger fabric, dependable fits, and clinical-grade hygiene protection.

Our brand recognises that temperature-controlled spaces are essential for care, but comfort must remain intact for every clinician delivering that care.

Our solutions provide warmth without introducing bulk. We keep the uniform professional in appearance and fully compliant with hospital standards, ensuring that comfort improves performance rather than hindering it.

# Smart Preparation Keeps Care Comfortable

Working in scrubs during colder seasons can be challenging, but the right approach makes a noticeable difference.

Layering intelligently, selecting better fabrics, wearing well-constructed jackets, and paying attention to circulation are strategies that strengthen comfort and performance.

Comfort supports better patient care, especially in colder environments. Mafatlal Healthcare’s winter-friendly uniforms help keep teams comfortable throughout long shifts.

# FAQs

**Can I wear a jacket or coat over my scrubs in the hospital?**

Usually, yes. Most hospitals are fine with scrub jackets or lab coats as long as they look professional and follow hygiene rules. It’s always better to go for medical outerwear instead of personal hoodies or bulky winter coats.

**What’s the best way to stay warm without affecting movement or hygiene?**

Think light layers that sit close to your skin, they keep you warm without getting in your way. Bulky sweaters can feel nice for a while, but they often restrict movement or brush against equipment.

**Are some scrubs better for colder weather?**

Absolutely. Scrubs made from slightly thicker blends, like poly-viscose or poly-cotton, help hold in warmth while still being easy to wash and care for. They also keep their colour and shape, even with frequent laundry cycles in busy hospitals.

**Can I wear thermals or leggings under my scrub pants?**

Yes, lots of healthcare professionals do exactly that on night shifts or in cold wards. Just choose a thin pair in a colour that won’t show through.

**Which socks are best for long, cold shifts?**

Warm socks make a bigger difference than people think. Good cotton or insulated socks help keep your feet comfortable and prevent the chill from creeping up your legs. Pair them with supportive work shoes so you’re warm and less tired by the end of the day.",1,1769151880.0,DoctorsAdvice,1,1.0,False

Tw: mentions of miscarriage ⚠️

All names used in this post are fake for anonymity 

Hi Reddit, I never post here so I’m sorry if my formatting is weird but I’m just not really sure what to do and I need some advice and outsider input. I’m gonna try to make this as short and vague as possible. This person who I’ll call Alex (19m) and I (19f) had a big falling out in about May of last year, it’s not necessarily relevant as it’s a very long story but our whole friendship we would have periods of not talking mostly due to something Alex would do that was disrespectful to me, then followed by half assed apologies and promises to do better. I’ve always forgiven him because we’ve been friends for so long (early elementary) and I believed he had my best interests at heart. Last year though he did something unforgivable that really opened my eyes to how disrespected I had been and how mentally taxing our friendship was on me and when I confronted him about it he completely blew up at me, calling me names, saying I was a terrible person, and saying he always cared about me and was always great to me but me confronting him was the “final straw”. That was fine with me though because I was done with his behaviour. It’s important to note I never insulted him back or said anything negative towards him after I confronted him, all I said was “if that’s how you feel then I guess that’s that” and blocked him. Another important note is Alex has a long history of serious mental health issues and drug abuse, he has been smoking weed basically all day everyday since he was 14 and I’ve heard through mutual friends that recently he’s been posting and talking about doing harder drugs like meth, but I don’t have proof of that. I also know from mutual friends that he has been hanging around our neighbouring cities homeless population (he is not homeless himself but his living situation is not great).

A few months ago we were on the same bus, his stop is before mine and he was on the top deck of the bus (double decker bus so there’s 2 floors) I got on the bus and stayed on the first deck, after a minute or two I hear him walk down the stairs, I was on my phone and didn’t look up but I could see his pants in my peripheral (he has a very distinct style and I’ve seen him wear these pants many times) as he walks past me he opens his arms to hit all the seats including mine, he then sits at the back of the bus and after a few stops I can hear him get up and move to the seat directly behind me, he then starts coughing and clearing his throat really loudly presumably to get my attention I guess. This whole time I don’t engage and just pretend he’s invisible and that I can’t hear him. I got off the bus and I could feel him standing directly behind me and follow me off the bus, I go into a nearby coffee shop but he stayed at the bus stop and didn’t follow me. That was the first incident but it didn’t really bother  me too much at the time, I just thought it was weird and I hoped that was that. 

Recently I was getting on the bus after work and he was getting off at the same stop I was getting on at, I didn’t realize he was there at first until I sat at a seat very close to the exit door and I heard him and his friend calling my name from right outside the bus. I kind of froze and I just didn’t look up. when I didn’t immediately look up they started calling my name in a very taunting way, like dragging it out in a funny mocking manner. I chose to pretend they weren’t there because honestly I hate confrontation and I don’t want to give him the time of day anyways, at some point his friend said really loudly “well that’s not very nice” again in that same mocking tone because I refused to acknowledge them. I have no clue who his friend is that said that, I didn’t get a look at his face but I didn’t recognize the voice at all. I was the first one on the bus so they were standing there calling my name for a minimum 15 seconds, I don’t really know though I was kind of frozen. I don’t have any video of them doing this but I have the exact date and time this happened and I also know exactly which bus it was. Idk if someone could find the bus footage from that but yeah. 

The last incident happened today and compelled me to make this post, idk about the legal grounds here because he didn’t message me, he messaged my friend Bella (19f) who also used to be friends with Alex but also stopped talking to them after Alex and I’s falling out. Bella texted me this morning to tell me that Alex had requested to follow her on tiktok after she had thought she was blocked by him (Bella never really blocked Alex because all of her socials are private anyways and I guess she just didn’t bother) I kind of had the thought of “here we go again” but hoped it would just be left at that. Unfortunately, Bella calls me later while I’m at work to tell me that Alex had dm’d her multiple times and she sent me screenshots of what he said. THIS NEXT PART IS REALLY GROSS YOU’VE BEEN WARNED. He first sent a photo of a random prescription bottle of oxycodone addressed to a name I didn’t recognize, then he sent a photo of I think those same pills crushed into powder and made into lines, he sent a photo of what looks like crystal meth and a lighter, he sent a photo of bloody toilet paper with shit on it, he sent a random photo of his estranged father (he showed me photos of him a long time ago), he sent a photo of I think his friend with a meth pipe in his mouth, TRIGGER WARNING AGAIN, finally he sent a photo of a large blot clot in his toilet and said “that one’s my baby lmao it fell out”. (Alex is transgender ftm) I don’t know if that was actually a photo of his miscarriage but that’s what it looked like. After sending all those photos he then sent a few messages in this order that said:

 “come onnnn you’re not gonna answer me??”

 “It’s almost like you hate me or something 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭” 

“How tragic” 

“Now why in the world would you hate me?? I can’t seem to put my finger on it”

“How’s (my name)?”

Bella never responded and blocked them after those messages, I have all the screenshots of them saved.

Now I’m just wondering what I should do? Is this enough to get a restraining order? Is there something else I should do instead? The messages weren’t sent to me but he does mention me in them and I think I have proof of him harassing me before, I think this was just an attempt to get my attention, I have him blocked on everything so I really don’t know if he’s tried to message me recently. I just want this to stop and I really hope this doesn’t escalate. All of this is causing me a lot of emotional distress and I’m scared to wait until something even worse happens. We both live in the same small town so I’ll inevitably see him again, he even knows my address. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",2,1769151869.0,legaladvice,1,0.75,False

The Arabic qahwa was the most interesting for me. It already has cardamom and saffron mixed in, which was a completely new experience. Very light roast, super aromatic, and not bitter at all. It honestly felt more like sipping something cultural than just “coffee.”

The Turkish one is the opposite — very fine grind, thick, strong, and intense. And then the Dunkin dark roast is the familiar, heavy, everyday kind of coffee, which made the contrast even clearer.

I’m still experimenting and learning as I go, but I really like how the Arabic and Turkish coffees feel more like a ritual than just a caffeine hit.

Do you remember your doppelganger? He must come back in before you can go out.

BOB BOB BOB

Go now! Go now!

My doppelganger 

Non-existent! 

Squeeze his hand off. Squeeze his hand off. Squeeze his hand off.

Is it the story of the little girl who lived down the lane? Is it?

Anon here.

Based in Sydney, and just wanted to double check something.

My friend from Japan asked to stay over my place; and I don’t normally offer my place as I lived in a share house in a terrace house. I agree, because we’ve travelled together, they’ve implied that we are close friends and I want to help them save money. I gave them a heads up that my place wouldn’t be the most comfortable stay as we are fighting a minor cockroach infestation; from our neighbours keeping heaps of rubbish in their yard, and they would be sharing a room with me. I let them know I purchased a military cot- in anticipation of their stay, and a little mattress to accompany the cot. I remain fairly communicative, and in the days coming to their stay, let them know there was a delay cutting a spare key for them because the shop was fairly busy before work, send them a message about my housemates, and the house rules. So far, so good, they seem receptive. They’ve sent me their schedule, invited me to hang out, told them the day I’m waiting for them at the airport- they have a meeting with their friend in the evening.

The day when they arrive, I wait for them at the airport, their flight is delayed. We take a train, and then an uber to my place.

I show them around the place, and because of the recent rainstorms our hot water tank recently ran out. I let them know, and tell them I’m not sure when the hot water will be back as we are waiting on our landlord to respond. I introduce them to my housemate and etc. I buy us some coffee and brekkie and catch up.

They tell me they’re going to their friend.

They have camera equipment so when I offer them to borrow a smaller bag when they see their friend they refuse.

They take their suitcase and cameras, and tell me they’re going to book a hotel for 3 days, and stay at mine for the rest. I’m like okay sure no problem, have you found a hotel yet?

They haven’t.

They tell me their meeting with their friend is actually at 12:30 and not in the evening like our previous chats.

I’m like okay sure no worries. As courtesy- I book them an uber to their meet up spot, as I don’t want them to run late.

I send them a message to apologise for uncomfortableness of my sharehouse, and to check in if they got into their hotel okay. Double checking if we’re hanging out tomorrow…

They don’t open up message.

They keep posting on their Instagram stories.

They don’t reply to my initial message to double check if they got it into their hotel okay. My follow up message in the morning after to double check if we are still hanging out.

I’ve sent them a final message today just to double check if everything is OKAY, and just to reiterate that I would love to shout them a nice dinner.

It’s a very disorientating experience especially when someone has asked me specifically to open up my home.  Like it’s very odd, when someone has said they consider me to be similar to one of their best friends, and to be treated like this? I’ve only talked about this to my housemate friend since they were going to be our guest, and my other close friend briefly about the scenario. It’s giving me a lot of anxiety, and I’m just like…. Am I the asshole?…

For context

### Your Mind Deserves a Little Color Too 🎨🧘‍♀️

Remember the first time you picked up a crayon as a kid?  
No rules. No to‑do lists. No deadlines — just color flowing across the page and whatever feeling came with it.

Somewhere between “growing up” and “replying to one more work email at midnight,” we traded that simple creativity for constant noise.  
That’s exactly why adult coloring books became a quiet rebellion for the overworked — mindfulness disguised as art.

When I started coloring again (yes, as a full‑fledged adult with taxes and back pain), I noticed something huge:  
the moment my pencil hit the page, the world slowed down.

💡 *Science backs it up too:*  
• Coloring lowers cortisol (your stress hormone).  
• It improves focus and encourages mindfulness.  
• It replaces doom‑scrolling with something actually *soothing.*

That calm space inspired me to help other adults rediscover that feeling — the peaceful, creative kind that doesn’t require perfection.  
So I put together a free **Adult Coloring Book PDF** made for modern minds that badly need a break.

👉 Grab your free copy here: [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

Inside, you’ll find pages that balance beauty and simplicity.  
Abstract patterns. Botanical escapes. Geometric meditations.  
All printable, all therapeutic.

Whether you color with morning coffee or at 2 AM when your brain won’t shut off — this is *your pocket of calm.*

I’m sharing this because genuine wellbeing isn’t sold; it’s shared.  
So if even one person decides to swap ten minutes of scrolling for ten minutes of coloring, that’s a win.

👉 Download your **Adult Coloring Book PDF** here: [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

Try printing out a page tonight. Notice how the simple motion of shading one pattern reconnects you to a quieter self you might’ve forgotten.

And if it helps, pass it on — to a friend, a coworker, or someone who simply deserves a calmer Tuesday.  
You never know whose day you’ll color a little brighter.

👉 One last time (so you don’t miss it): [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

Because a few pages of art won’t fix everything… but they might just fix *your* mood for the day.

Just came across this video from January 11th  five guys from Gujarat, all with the last name Patel, got arrested for straight-up robbing a gas station in Alliston, ON. They stole random crap like a coffee machine and microwave, smashed stuff up, but got caught red-handed because they didn't even bother fleeing properly. No weapons or injuries, but still charged with robbery and property damage, released pending court in February. 

Here's the link: https://youtu.be/u84N-3JXpmM?si=\_YP\_M3KT\_5MRZ0In

Now, why am I posting this here? Because this isn't just some isolated ""rare incident"" like the video calls it. This screams immigration system failure. How many of these ""temporary"" workers or students come in on bogus LMIAs, fake job offers, or exploited student visa pathways, only to end up underemployed, desperate, and turning to crime when things go south? We've all seen the patterns: Shell companies posting minimum-wage jobs no Canadian wants (because they're crap), just to bring in cheap labor or fast-track PR for the connected. But when the permits expire and there's no path to stay, what do you think happens?

And get this  with around 1.8 million temporary resident permits (including work permits) set to expire by the end of 2026, we're staring down the barrel of way more stories like this. IRCC's own data shows over 4 million expiring across 2025-2026, but cuts to PR spots mean most won't transition legally. Desperation kicks in: No job, no status, mounting debts from shady recruiters back home. Result? Petty crimes, scams, or worse to survive. 

We've already got rising reports of fraud rings, accident scams, and now this kind of bold stupidity. It's not about hating immigrants  it's about a broken system that exploits everyone and leaves Canadians picking up the tab in higher crime, strained services, and lost jobs.

If you're qualified for these ""shortage"" jobs, apply and report when they ghost you. Email your MP about tightening LMIA oversight and deporting fraudsters faster. Let's spread the word before this becomes the new normal. Thoughts? Anyone seen similar in their area?",57,1769151203.0,LMIASCAMS,8,0.91,False

1qkjt7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qkjt7b/the_dangers_of_staying_awake/,The Dangers Of Staying Awake,"I think we all know sleep is important, but that doesn’t mean we all agree about it. How much should we get? Should you sleep in pajamas, underwear, nude? TV on or off? Hope or cold? I mean, we can’t even agree on if we like it or not! 

Personally, I like sleeping. More specifically I like dreaming. I love seeing what my brain can come up with, and if we’re being really honest my life isn’t exactly as pleasant or interesting as the dreams I have. Sure I’ve had plenty of “nightmares” too- murderers, abductions, monsters and the like. I just don’t feel afraid in my dreams for some reason? 

I mean, I’ve once dreamt of having a drill slowly pushed into my head by these demonic creatures from hell, chasing me with fingertips lined in saws and scratching at my flesh while I ran… but not once was I scared. I did wake up with my skin stinging and a mild headache, but that sorta thing happened a lot. I \*felt\* my dreams a lot- or maybe what I felt influenced my dreams? Who knows.

Anyways, this isn’t about my dreams or my sleep really. It’s about what happens when I \*don’t sleep.\* For starters, I’ve got ADHD, and while I’m unmedicated it means things like coffee don’t really keep me up like that. Hell, I used to drink it to make myself ready for bed when I was younger. 

What \*has\* always kept me up though is sinking myself into something interesting. A new video game, an obsessive Wikipedia search, writing an essay I was excited to share, or even reading a particularly thrilling book. You know how it goes though- wake up, have a full day, get ready for bed but you’re not ready yet. So, you stay up a little bit, and next thing you know the sun’s come up. 

That’s how easy it is, \*that’s how you stay up for your first 24 hours.\* From there you can’t really go to bed though, or I guess you could but it’d have to be a weekend or else you’d jeopardize your sleep schedule the rest of the week. It’s one thing to haven’t had slept, but it’s an even worse thing to have barely slept at all. 

So I always elect to stay up, and that’s when it starts to get weird. By lunch it’s usually been \*about 32 hours\*, give-or-take, and that’s when they start. In the corner of my eyes I’ll start to see glimpses of things. Like a shadow moving just out of sight, or a small glint of bright light only to see nothing there. It’s a common visual hallucination, even for people who aren’t sleep-deprived. 

There’s also the noises. Subtle at first too- a friend’s voice being startling loud when they start to talk, or a pencil hitting the floor sounding for a second like it was metal instead of wood, or a small bump now sounds like a door slamming somewhere far off. These hallucinations start slow- maybe 1-3 an hour at most, and that’s combining the audio and the visual. 

It’s also around here the exhaustion hits, a big slump. It’s odd, it’s always when it’s the brightest out that you get tired- not when it’s dark. No, later when it’s dark it’s \*starting to approach 40 hours\* or so. Now’s when you should’ve gone to sleep the day before, except you’re still awake. What’s even stranger is… you’re not tired. I never am anyways. I’m wide-awake. 

It’s strange being up in the middle of the night, alone, when everyone is asleep. It’s even somewhat thrilling if you’re that sleep deprived though. The hallucinations are stronger by now. Small glimpses become full movements. A stray hair in the corner of your vision looks like a curling tendril for just a second. Or a gust of wind outside sounds like a garbage truck driving past.

Actually, it’s about this point that I notice a very specific hallucination. It’s always the same, and sometimes it comes earlier in the day, but always at night it’s the sound of a dinner party in the next room over. Low and hushed chatter, clinking plates and glasses, and this vague but whimsical jazz playing. I’ve never been to any sort of party like that myself, but it’s unmistakeable. I could close my eyes and see exactly what that room would look like, almost like it was out of the 20’s itself. 

Then there’s the tactile hallucinations. These are… less comforting. Random itches will crop-up, only to disappear the moment you graze them. You’ll feel the brush of hair on your ankles, wrists, and neck every so often- only to swat at them and feel nothing there. Very rarely, and I do mean rarely, you’ll feel a firm \*poke\* or \*tap\* on the shoulder or arm. 

Obviously nothing is there, but by this point these things become frequent enough to be a distraction. They start to occur once every 10 minutes or so, and in random ways. By time morning arrives it’s officially been \*48 hours\* and it only ramps up. 

Here is where things get scary… the hallucinations, they’re just that- hallucinations. What gets scary is everything else. You stop being tired. Actually, you feel kind of amazing? More awake than before. More acutely aware of everything around you than before. Food tastes better, light looks brighter, and even a beam of a cold winter sun feels warmer on the skin. 

Sure the hallucinations continue, and they do ramp-up, but… it’s wonderful. It’s like the same level of vividness you could only experience in a dream. The world stops feeling real then, and people start to feel… off. It’s like when you’re watching a movie, and you’re right there connecting with the characters, and the next thing you know you realize “you’re not real, why do I care?” That immediate hollow detachment hits. 

So yes, the world is beautiful and you feel great, but you stop caring about people- no… you stop relating to them is more accurate, you stop feeling like a person. I’m… I’m not sure how to describe this next bit. Usually by lunchtime it’s around \*hour 56\* and that’s where things start to get genuinely scary. 

By now the hallucinations are more real than before. A man stares at you from the corner, and when you turn your head to confront him you realize it’s a coat rack. You don’t see the crosswalk light change until you’ve almost stepped out into traffic. The sound of your own voice becomes foreign to you. It feels like somebody is always bumping into you, grabbing you, or nudging you. 

They’re constant now. One every few minutes, at the very least that many, and they’ve started to overlap. A girl in front of you tosses her hair while your shoe squeaks? Congrats, you’ve just hallucinated birds flying at your face. You get jumpy, and sensitive, and everything is almost too much and yet not enough. 

I’d usually get home around \*hour 60\* or so, alone in my house and get constantly surrounded my noise. That damn dinner party is louder, there’s constant sounds around you that aren’t real- snippets of shows, conversations, songs. It’s not overwhelming or bad or even unpleasant, it’s just… it’s there. 

I’m… I’m ashamed to admit I’ve never made it past \*hour 63\*. That’s my personal best anyways. It’s not because I got tired or anything either, no. Actually, it’s because I got scared. The scariest part isn’t that you hallucinate, or that your mind is a wreck- it’s that \*it feels so good\*. It feels so much better than normal life. It feels exactly like when you wake up in the morning and want nothing more than to stay asleep. It feels like the times when my dream feels better than reality, when staying asleep is better than waking up. 

It becomes a challenge to go to sleep. Melatonin, Benadryl, NyQuil- none of them work at this point, I’ve tried. I once read that approaching 72 hours of no sleep puts you at immediate risk of a cardiovascular event- namely a heart attack. I believe it. I believe it in the same way they say you can feel so much joy, or laughter, or pleasure that you die from a heart attack too. 

 You start to feel… lost. Like you’re slipping into a dream, except the dream is you being awake. The only way I’ve found that works for me is to listen to that jazz in the distance. I close my eyes, find the music through all the sound, and focus. I listen to the music, the conversation, and ignore everything else. Eventually, I open my eyes and I’ve slept. 

I used to want to push my record. It’s true. That jazz used to come sooner too, around hour 24 at first. I kept pushing my limits though, more and more… I lied when I said I hadn’t made it past hour 63. One time I made it to \*hour 64\* and it was then that the music just… stopped. It vanished. I couldn’t find it anymore. I couldn’t sleep without it though either. 

I looked up music online frantically, I needed it to sleep, I needed to sleep. I needed to wake up from this waking dream by going to sleep. I think I must’ve given myself a panic attack because I don’t even remember going to bed.

The rich aroma filling your kitchen, the syrupy body, the vibrant notes of dark chocolate or stone fruit – this daily ritual is transformed when you have a consistent supply of exceptional beans. For the discerning coffee lover, securing that supply is paramount, yet the concept of ""bulk buying"" often brings compromise to mind: stale beans, uncertain origins, and diminishing returns on flavor.

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Experience coffee at its peak. Our roast-to-order system ensures your beans arrive days, not weeks or months, after roasting, preserving every nuanced aroma and flavor.

**Ultra Red** \- I've seen this before, but a welcome sight nonetheless. Made in June 2024

**Ultra Blue** \- Also a rare bird, the second time I've seen it and the first time I've bought it. I already drank this one, I like it a lot. Made in March 2025

**Juice Papillon** \- Never seen this. I'm very curious about it. Heavily considering trying it. Made in May 2024

**Reserve Kiwi Strawberry** \- Completely forgot this one existed, might try it. Made in May 2024

**Java Cold Brew Sweet Black** \- I'm gonna be honest, I hate coffee, but this was so intriguing I had to have it. Unfortunately it's concerningly old, especially for a Java. Made in May 2022

**Hydro Blue Ice** \- Saw this and the other Hydro before anything else. Unfortunately, this one appears to have already decayed too much for me to safely drink it, as there was a small amount of white residue at the bottom. Made in August 2024

**Hydro Purple Passion** \- Similar story to the other, but for some reason much more white stuff in the bottom. Definitely not gonna try it. I might take one and thoroughly clean it out for a cool ass water bottle though. Made in August 2024

I had a college thingy in town so I made a plan to go to a bunch of international stores to try to find exotic Monsters. As you can seen, that didn't pan out and I pretty much found jack diddly squat, aside from the Thai Red Bull. Cue a grace period between events and the hotel's food service is terrible. So, I walk a couple blocks down to a hole in the wall convenience store and LO AND FRICKIN BEHOLD, the Jackpot. Many of these were oneoffs, but still. 7 rare Monsters is the most I've ever seen, and probably will ever see, from one store.

Anyway, I'm gonna do some testing on the blue Hydro and see if it's at least safe to sip. If not I'll probably empty it out and repurpose it into the world's most stylish water bottle.

""Walk as if you are kissing the earth with your feet"" -- Thich Nhat Hanh

I love that so much. Gratitude is a practice, it's something we can get better at, but it's also very simple. It's being present in each moment (now...now) even as your feet touch the ground (now...now) and being thankful, even towards the earth itself, to things that can't say ""you're welcome"" :) Here you are, YOU won the brief holiday from eternity; from the endless ranks of possible people, you were chosen. Amazing, no?

Coming back down to earth ever so slightly, and probably what put me into this frame of mind, is another quote (which I'll give in context) from [a book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-We-Can-Know-bestselling/dp/1787335739) set a couple hundred years into an imagined (let's hope) future in which we all live on islands, such is the devastation caused by global warming. The protagonist is reviewing the preparation that someone in our time is making for a party:

""We can assume that on the afternoon of her list-making, she drove eight miles to the market town of Cirencester to collect from the butcher ‘five brace of prepared quail, unnaturally plump’. She would wrap them in bacon and roast them in red wine and herbs, along with ceps picked in the beechwoods of the Chiltern Hills and brought to the Barn by a friend. She
also bought eight pounds of potatoes for the oven and, in the same greengrocer, three cauliflowers whose florets she would cook in a large paella pan with ‘olive oil, garlic, chopped green chillies, anchovies, cherry tomatoes, black pepper, thyme and breadcrumbs’. 

Those were the days.""

Those last four words. Those were the days. Having access to such a wide palette of food and drink, something that's easily taken for granted and so unique to this moment in time, in comparison to most of human history. [Thank you, cup of coffee](https://soundcloud.com/johndoran-armstrong/thank-you-thank-you)! In what ways could it be that: THESE are the THOSE were the days? Is it possible to be more grateful for the things in our lives right now? Can we be more thankful during the fact, now...now...as much as we can be after the fact?

1qkjeqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qkjeqq/i_think_i_lost_a_friend/,I think I lost a friend.,"I made friends with a coworker almost 10 years ago. We started off as acquaintances and grew close at the start of Covid and she started referring to me as her “bestie” shortly after lockdown. We took trips together, talked to each other daily, helped with each others kids/pets etc.. the bond was there. 

Starting 2 years ago I went back to school. I made it clear from the beginning that my end game was to eventually find a better job and have more marketability in the field we both work in (healthcare) I never hid this fact. It’s always been known I would look for and take a new job away from my friend once I graduated. I didn’t want to quit my job that I had with my friend but after 5 years of working the same schedule and getting a bigger workload with no pay raises of any significance I knew a change was needed. At first I asked my friend and other coworkers if they would be willing to work with me so I could just change my schedule I wanted different days off etc..  the first 2-3 months following graduation my friend said “Yeah sure we can work something out.” I have a voice note of this and my husband heard her say it. Once I passed my boards and was officially graduated and licensed with my new degree I came up with some mock schedules and ideas for change this was about 6 months after graduation. Immediately my friend blew me off and said she didn’t like any of the schedule ideas I had and she wasn’t going to change. Other coworkers also refused. I began a job hunt 6-8 months post graduation. 

At month 9 I was offered a job. The pay wasn’t better but they gave me the schedule I wanted and it was a job where I would get exposed to higher complex work and learn more. I really wanted said job so I took it. Immediately my friend told me I was making a mistake, told me my current job was best for my family and lifestyle, and that I was being overly dramatic with needing to change things. I took the job and quietly exited my old employment where I had been for 13 years. Between starting my new job and months 11/12 my friend and I talked a little less because I have 3 kids, a husband, and I had to train at said new job. My friend is a single mom of an adult kid, with a lot less responsibilities than me. I reached out as often as I could and tried to keep the lines of communication open. 

My birthday happened in month 12 and the night of my

Birthday my husband took me out for dinner and drinks. 1/2 way through the night my friend started texting that she had a gift for me at work and I needed to pick it up from her that night in person. I had been drinking and over did it. My husband had to bring me home and take care of me. The next morning I woke up and messaged my friend and apologized for not going to get my gift, explained what happened and left it at that with plans to get the gift later on. 

Fast forward my friend messaged me upset, I hurt her feelings terribly, how dare I not open her gift and immediately show a reaction. The whole thing was weird and my husband even agreed it was almost like she picked a fight. She brings the gift by my house a few hours after I apologized and leaves it on my porch. I open the gift and it’s a thrifted coffee mug and some hot cocoa mix. A nice gift but nothing over the top. I had gotten her some really nice perfume and had it sent to her home and never got any kind of acknowledgment or even a Thankyou. The next week was her daughter and mines birthdays. I wished her child happy birthday. She ghosted my child. 

It’s now been 45 days since we last spoke and she has ghosted me. I messaged her at Xmas and I got a “merry Xmas” text back. That’s it. I’ve sent a few voice notes since with no response. Mutual friends have said she is deeply hurt and I have upset her. We are still connected on socials but she has simply stopped talking. 

I am ND and throughly confused. I was always taught that expecting reactions to gifts is rude and having strings attached. I feel she was looking for a reason to end the friendship because I no longer served a purpose for her. I’m feeling very used but also confused. I really don’t feel I was that rude. But maybe I was? 

A side note to this is my friend has had a few health setbacks this last year and her memory has suffered quite a bit. When working together I frequently had to go behind her and fix things she forgot or messed up and I had been doing this for awhile. I tried addressing it with her and never got anywhere. On top of this I found out she had been diagnosed as bipolar before I met her and she hid it from me, now she isn’t required to tell me her health issues but my husband and I had suspected she was bipolar for awhile based on behaviors and things she does. She told me casually she was once diagnosed bipolar but quickly told me “That doctor was wrong, I’m not really bipolar.” My friend has insomnia that lasts 6-7 days at a time and she self medicates with various things to cope. I feel like my switching jobs effectively ended our friendship and it wasn’t my intention. My kid runs into her kid all the time and has said that she is rude to her. I see her sister regularly and the vibes are off there as well. Everyone is treating me like I’m a bad boyfriend who broke up with her and I don’t get it. 

I’m sad about it but also lost on how to just let go and walk away. How can a person be mad at you for doing exactly what you told them you would do for over a year and following through with my goals/dreams? ",1,1769149598.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Apologies in advance for the long post and for being that guy… Asking the question that’s probably been asked a 1000 times. I’m relocating from NYC, and currently drowning in 147 open Zillow tabs.

**The Context:** I’m a new dad (in the trenches) and my wife and I are making the jump from (Greenpoint) Brooklyn to Seattle and I’m starting a new gig on the Eastside. **I’m hoping to get a 2026 neighborhoods vibe check**. Most threads I’ve seen are old enough to potentially be outdated. 

In terms of priorities:

1. **Safety:** I’m coming from NYC, but I lived in SF for a bit and the open-air drug markets there gave me some legit PTSD (robbed at gunpoint). I need a neighborhood where my family can go on walks, while I’m at the office and I won’t have to worry (within reason). 
2. **Walkability/Vibes:** My wife isn’t ready to surrender to the suburbs yet so we want to be in the city. We don’t drive. At all. So we’ll be relying on public transport and our feet mostly. Since she’s leaving a full life in NYC (job, friends, etc and doesn’t mind the rain) she's made it clear we have to be able to walk to activities/conveniences nearby, beer gardens, restaurants, grocery stores (and ideally a pediatrician) or this move won’t work for anyone :). Are we delusional to try and live in Seattle proper without a car?
3. **The Commute:** Hoping to keep the commute reasonable to the eastside (work provides transportation to and from the office, so it's about how long it would take driving). 

**Currently considering the below - in no particular order or preference (but have questions on each based on my research- please feel free to roast):**

* **Queen Anne:** Seems bougie, is it actually walkable or basically the burbs?
* **Fremont/Wallingford/ Phinney Ridge**: Would the commute be hell? Would it be worth it?
* **Capitol Hill:** Seems like the vibe but is it too crazy for a young family? Seems like there’s been an uptick in crime. Is North Cap Hill the sweet spot?
* **Madison Valley:** Is this just a fancy name for the burbs, is it actually walkable?
* **Belltown:** Seems cool but am I gonna be dodging encampments every week?
* **SLU:** The apt buildings have a lot of amenities. Is that cause there's nothign to do nearby? Is this a neighborhood or just corporate cafeterias and mirrored glass?

**Context:**

There are many things I regret.

Like when my friend asked me if he can stay at my place for two weeks I said yes even though it made me uncomfortable.

Like drinking coffee in the afteroon and can't fall asleep at 12:00 am.

Like quiting learning programming after a bug can't be located.

It never occured to me that I had been living with these problems. To be frank, I'm not even aware that they exist.

Last October my partner and I had a long late night conversation, over how I quit studying programming again (for the seventh time). I told him debugging is really upsetting, it's like trying to guess a number in a black box. It's so hard, I said. Then somehow it occured to me that I had been quitting learning new things since ever.

When in senior high, my Physics teacher was very strict. Then I stopped studying physcis because whenever he scolded me I could tell myself ""I choose not to study physics"".

When in college, I wasn't interested in my major, I just played a lot of video games. My friend invited me to do internships I said no, I said ""I'm going to do a graduate program so internships don't matter""

Now that I'm living with my partner, I never cared to learn about how light bulbs are replaced, or a toilet can be unclogged. I tell myself ""that's what a man needs to know. As long as I take care of other chores, it's OK""

I know studying physics would get me into a better college, but I didn't

I know internships would get me on the ground but I didn't

I know programming would boost my career but I quit studying it

I repeat my quit pattern everytime.

It's like finally a ray of sunshine broke the dark clouds, that I finally see my trueself: I am my habits, I am what I choose to do and what to not to do. My life is a free loop. I repeat everyday. I have a problem yesterday and the same problem emerges again tomorrow.

It struck me so hard that I started to search how I could work on these problems, or to stay aware of them.

**KPT method was what I decided to try.**

I created a weekly log of 7 entries. Each entry has three major sections: Keep, Problem, Solve. In each section I have minor-sections. It's something like this:

|**2025**|**2/2/2026**|
|:-|:-|
|||**Monday**|
|Plan|**Morning**|Job-related stuff|
|**Noon**|Gym, no coffee||
|**Afternoon**|Job-related stuff||
|**Night**|Fight with family||
|Keep|Effective ways to study|Excel shortcuts:|
|Positive Attitude|The project I'm working on is really hard but I kept working on it||
|Communication and Cooperation|My friend wanted to move in with me, I am brave enough to tell him no because I enjoy living alone without feeling guilty about it||
|Health Habits|1. Didn't drink coffee, instead I had a banana and went out for a walk around 4 pm, felt great2. Went swimming during lunchbreak felt great||
|Problem|Efficiency and Plans|My plan to write a book review for Anna Karennina fell through because I was too tired from work. If I want to work on it, maybe I need to give it higher priority|
|Communication and Cooperation|My mom set up a date for me I didn't say no eventhough I want to||
|Skills and Knowledge|Toilet won't stop flushing, I don't know why, I turned off the knob beneath the toilet||
|Mood and Emotions|My partner didn't praise my dinner today it got me upset. I should try to not do stuff just for people's acknowledge||
|Try|To solve this spefic problem, I would||
|To improve xxx, I would|||
|Learn/Experience new things|1. To fix the toilet flushing thing, I need to either hire a plumber and try to figure out what he did, or watch youtube self-fix tutorials||

Every moring I get up, fill in the table, and review it. What's to keep today? What can I work on today? What issues should I really pay attention to?

And sometimes I review the logs of last month. The past success provideds confidence for me: in October I saw the dentist after much hesitation and procrastination, and eventually it wasn't so bad. Seeing this entry, I immediately booked the dentist to check my other tooth.

It's almost like directing a river: I control my self, I decide what I do today and tomorrow, and I build my future rather than sitting there, letting time flow by unconsicously.",39,1769149460.0,LifeProTips,2,0.85,False

Dominic Blackwell threw me a schedule on our wedding night.

Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays—he'd come home.

Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays—Vanessa got him.

Sundays? Threesome.

Vanessa Sterling—his dead best buddy's baby sister, his untouchable first love.

But guess what?

Not once in five years did I get him alone.

He never showed on MY nights—always ""emergencies"" with Vanessa.

Until that night, I overheard him laughing on the phone.

""Sophie? Just feed her some excuse. Fu//ck her—she'll spread her legs whenever I whistle.""

""Vanessa's struggling right now. She comes first.""

Something inside me finally snapped.

No tears. No begging.

Screw you, asshole. I don't do time-shares anymore!

I grabbed my backup phone and sent a single text:

""You promised if I was unhappy, you'd come get me. Still offering?""

The phone died the second I hit send.

I collapsed onto the bedroom carpet—the scene from the study looping in my mind.

Dominic, leaning against his desk all casual, telling his assistant.

""Just make up whatever. Sophie never asks questions anyway.""

""Marcus died young. Vanessa's all alone in this world. I owe him my life—gotta make it right.""

Every lonely night I'd spent waiting.

Every dinner I'd reheated until it went cold.

All of it stabbed through my ch//est like ice picks.

Staring at this empty bedroom, I couldn't breathe.

Five years married. He'd never spent a single night here.

Every time he came back from HER place, he'd bring me guilt gifts.

Perfume. Designer bags. Once, some jade bracelet from a charity auction.

I actually thought it was his way of showing he cared.

Now I knew—every gift was just guilt wrapped in a bow.

I started smashing them. One by one.

The door slammed open. Dominic stormed in.

He froze when he saw the wreckage.

""What are you doing?""

I didn't turn around, kept my voice steady even though I was shaking.

""It's Monday. You staying tonight?""

Silence.

Dominic's eyes flickered. He grabbed my hand.

""Something came up. I swear, next time I'll stay.""

I looked at his face, so close to mine. Pain ripped through my heart.

""Dominic, I'M your wife! But for five years, Vanessa's been the one living like your real wife.""

Five years of swallowing everything came pouring out.

He dropped to one knee in front of me, wiping my tears.

""Marcus died for me. Vanessa's depression is serious—if I'm not there, she'll hurt herself.""

""I love YOU. But you don't want another death on my conscience, right?""

He sounded so sincere. I just felt cold.

I was about to shove him away when my phone buzzed. Voice message from his mother Margaret:

""Dinner at the estate tonight. We need to talk about you having a baby.""

My heart sank.

Margaret had been on my case for years about not getting pregnant.

Called me a ""barren b!tch"" in front of everyone. Even went on a hunger strike to force Dominic to divorce me.

Three days and three nights on his knees outside her door—that's what finally stopped her.

Now he squeezed my hand, voice soft.

""Don't worry. I'll go with you.""

Vanessa's call came through before he finished his sentence.

""Dom? My stomach's killing me. Can you come over?""

He let go of my hand instantly.

""Sophie, Vanessa's not doing well. You go to dinner—I'll pick you up later.""

Then he was gone.

Tears blurred everything. My face was already soaked.

Midnight came and went. No Dominic.

I took Margaret's insults alone, catching whispers from the maids in the hallway:

""Miss Sterling's entryway was full ofempty condom boxes! Really wild.""

""Bet you anything SHE gets knocked up before the wife does.""

""Five years, no baby—better off divorcing now.""

I bit my lip till it hurt, letting every word stab me.

When Dominic proposed, he knelt in front of both our families and swore he'd cherish me forever.

Everyone said I married for love.

But on our wedding night, his friends stopped me outside the weeding room.

""Dom! Vanessa tried to kill herself—go now!""

That night he knelt in front of me, eyes red, apologizing over and over.

""Sophie, I'm so sorry. But I owe them—I can't abandon her.""

""Just trust me. Once she moves on and starts fresh, we'll have our life together.""

Looking at his bloodshot eyes, I caved.

For five years, I guarded an empty marriage.

Turns out every ""work emergency"" night, he was wrapped up in another woman's arms.

I dried my tears and signed the divorce papers.

The second I finished, the doorbell rang.

Vanessa shoved past me and walked in.

She looked around, all fake drama.

""Wow, this place is tiny. I mean, makes sense—just you here. Dominic never comes home anyway.""

I capped my pen. ""What do you want?""

She laughed, flashing the fresh hickeys on her neck.

""Look what YOUR husband did to me. He kept me up all night—wouldn't stop no matter how much I begged.""

Then she covered her mouth like she just remembered something.

""Oh right. You've probably never even had a real man, huh? Poor thing.""

My fists clenched.

When I didn't react, her fake smile dropped.

""Sophia, even when I'm on my period, Dominic would rather je//rk off at MY place than come back to you. Get a clue!""

""Do yourself a favor. Leave him. Now.""

I stood up slowly and opened the door.

""Done talking? Get out.""

The second I finished, something vicious flashed in Vanessa's eyes.

Then she screamed and collapsed to the floor.

""My baby! Oh God, it hurts!""

The door exploded open. Dominic stormed in and kicked me aside without a second thought.

He rushed to Vanessa, holding her tight, panic all over his face.

""Vanessa! Are you okay?""

She collapsed against him, sobbing.

""Dom... the baby... what if something happens to our baby...""

When Dominic turned back to me, his eyes were pure rage.

Before I could even get my balance, his hand cracked across my face.

""Sophia! How could you be this evil!""

""Marcus took a bullet for me! Vanessa's got nobody in this world, I swallowed your cold looks before!""

""But NOW? You KNOW she's pregnant, and you pull this sh!t?""

""That baby is EVERYTHING to her! The last of the Sterling bloodline!""

My cheek bu//rned, but I barely felt it.

Just stared at him, voice shaking.

""She's pregnant? With your baby?""

The way he shielded her belly felt like a knife straight through my heart.

Dominic's voice went ice cold.

""If anything happens to Vanessa or this baby, I will NEVER forgive you!""

He paused, seemed to realize how harsh that sounded.

Then his eyes dropped to the necklace around my neck.

""Take off that necklace."" An order.

""Give it to Vanessa. Call it an apology.""

The necklace?

I stumbled backward, hands flying up to protect it.

""This was my mother's! She traded her LIFE for this bless charm!""

""Dominic! You made promises at her deathbed—you forgot already?!""

He paused for half a second, then his face hardened.

""You married me. Everything you have is MINE.""

""It's just some old necklace—you think that's worth more than a life?""

Then he grabbed my throat and ripped the necklace off my neck.

I hit the floor hard from the force, crawling toward him to take it back—but he shoved me away again.

""Give it back!""

When my mom was dying, she'd begged me not to marry Dominic.

But Dominic stayed by her bed for three months straight, took care of everything. Then knelt in front of her and swore:

""Ma'am, I'll treasure Sophia more than my own life.""

""As long as I'm breathing, she'll never suffer. Not once.""

Mom finally gave in.

With trembling hands, she'd placed that necklace in Dominic's palm and watched him tie it around my neck.

He knew better than anyone what it meant to me.

Vanessa barely glanced my way as she took the necklace from him, played with it for a second.

Then casually tossed it out the window.

The wind caught it. It disappeared into the distance.

""NO!""

I threw myself at the window, half my body hanging out.

Dominic looked stunned for a moment. Then his face hardened:

""Sophia, it's just a necklace. Let it go.""

""Acting crazy like this—what if you scare Vanessa and the baby?""

He ignored my breakdown and wrapped an arm around Vanessa.

""Don't worry. I'll take you home. We can't risk the baby.""

The necklace drifted farther and farther away.

The wind seared my eyes, but no tears came out.

""Dominic. I want a divorce.""

The air went dead silent.

He spun around, staring at me like I'd lost my mind.

""Over a stupid necklace? You want a DIVORCE?""

I stood up slowly, straightened my clothes, picked up the signed divorce papers from the table.

I looked him in the eyes.

""Yes.""

His shock twisted into pure rage in an instant.

""Sophia, when did you become this ridiculous?""

""Don't forget—without the Blackwells, without ME, you'd be homeless!""

""Five years and you couldn't even get pregnant. Everyone in our circle knows you're my leftovers. What man would want you now?""

He snatched the divorce papers and ripped them to shreds.

""Divorce? In your dreams!""

Then he shoved me hard and carefully helped Vanessa out.

I slammed into the coffee table edge, pain tearing through my ribs.

Without even looking back, Dominic said gently to Vanessa.

""When the baby's born, we'll give him the Sterling name.""

""I'll take care of him—honor Marcus's memory properly.""

""And if Sophia ever messes with you again, tell me. I won't go easy on her.""

I stared at my own miserable reflection in the window and suddenly laughed.

Three days.

Whether he signed or not, I was gone.

But that night, I was jolted awake by a splash of boiling water.

I opened my eyes to find Dominic's hands around my throat, eyes wild.

""Sophia! I warned you to behave!""

""You bribed the housekeeper! Poisoned Vanessa's pregnancy meds! She's hemorrhaging at the hospital right now—almost lost our baby!""

I could barely breathe, kicking and struggling.

""Poison? I didn't—I don't know anything about—""

He threw me into the car, sped to the hospital, and dumped me at Vanessa's ward.

Before I could stand, he kicked the back of my knee, forcing me down onto the freezing marble floor.

""Kneel. You apologize when Vanessa wakes up!""

Everything hurt. My vision kept going dark.

Then the hospital door burst open.

Vanessa came at me with a knife.

""You murderer! Give me back my baby!""

I tried to dodge, but the blade sank deep into my side anyway.

Pain exploded. I clutched my bleeding waist and looked at Dominic.

Once, when I'd cut my finger cooking, he'd rushed me to the ER in the middle of the night for stitches.

Now I was bleeding out, and he just calmly adjusted his cuffs.

""Sophia. You owe her this. Relax. You won't die.""

I couldn't speak through the pain. Just stared at him.

Vanessa's eyes were bloodshot. She pulled the knife out and came at me again.

Once. Twice.

Warm blood kept spilling out. I coughed up red and collapsed in the spreading pool.

Only then did Dominic step forward to stop her.

""Vanessa, that's enough.""

""She's been punished. Don't actually kill her—bad karma for the baby.""

She leaned into him, sobbing.

""But she almost killed OUR baby!""

""Dominic, if you protect her one more time, I'm taking this baby and go die with Marcus right now!""

Then she turned the knife around.

Pointed it at her own belly.

""Vanessa! Stop! Put the knife down!""

Dominic's buddies burst into the room and ripped the blade from her hand.

The biggest one backhanded me across the face.

""Poison b!tch! Can't get knocked up yourself so you gotta kill someone else's baby!""

""Boys, time to teach her a lesson. We owe Marcus that much!""

""Make her slap herself! Don't stop till she bleeds!""

My ears rang from the hit. I caught Dominic's eyes—saw him waver for half a second.

Then his face went cold again.

""Sophia. Take your punishment. Vanessa's a war hero's family. You crossed the line.""

""Get her the brass knuckles. Let's wake her up.""

Dominic grabbed my hand roughly and forced the too-small knuckles onto my fingers.

I clutched at his pant leg, voice shaking.

""I swear—it wasn't me! please believe me!""

""Still lying?!""

He kicked my hand away.

Two guys grabbed my arms and slammed me against the wall.

One grabbed my hair, forced my hand up, and made me slap myself.

Vanessa snuggled into Dominic's side, shrieking.

""Harder! Don't stop till you hit a thousand!""

My face swelled and split open. Blood mixed with tears.

I bit my tongue just to stay awake.

The pain on my face was nothing compared to my heart.

After the thousandth slap, they kicked me into the corner like garbage.

My body went cold. Half my soul already felt gone.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back at the villa.

Dominic sat by the bed, gently cleaning the cut on my forehead.

He set the cotton swab down, voice flat.

""Vanessa's baby is fine. She's calmed down.""

""Once the kid's born, I won't need to be with her anymore. I'll come home on time.""

My heart dropped like a stone.

I pushed his hand away weakly. Smiled—bitter, broken:

""Five years, Dominic. Five whole years.""

""One call from her and you'd drop everything. Always said it was because Marcus took a bullet for you.""

""But does that debt really cost your entire life? Even giving her your baby?""

His eyes flickered. Looked away.

He put the medicine down, calm but final.

""Sophie, I know you're hurt.""

""But when Marcus was dying, he grabbed my hand and said 'Take care of my family and my sister.' He's gone. Someone has to carry on the Sterling line.""

""Starting tomorrow, stay home and rest. I already quit your job for you. Vanessa will take over.""

Fighting back the searing in my eyes, I finally asked the question that had haunted me for years.

""Dominic. These past five years.""

""Every Monday, Wednesday, Friday—you never actually had work, did you?""

""You just didn't want to come home. You never loved me at all. Right?""

Dominic went quiet.

The silence stretched.

Then I heard the word I expected—the one that still shattered me anyway.

""Right.""

I knew it was coming.

But hearing Dominic admit it out loud still destroyed me.

""Why? Five whole years watching people talk sh!t about me, watching me suffer—and you never once stood up for me.""

He reached for my face, voice soft but cruel.

""Sophie, you know you're the only one in my heart.""

""These five years with Vanessa—it was only because her brother saved my life. I promised him I'd take care of his family.""

""Now she's pregnant. Once the baby's born, it's over.""

""Then we'll have our own kid. Start fresh. Okay?""

I turned my head away, nausea rising in my throat.

""Just looking at you makes me sick.""

""Dominic. I want a divorce.""

His face went cold in an instant.

His eyes darkened, lips curling into a bitter smile.

""Fine. Real classy.""

""Everyone in this city knows you're MINE. You file for divorce now, where does that leave the Blackwell name?""

""Starting today, you stay locked in here.""

""No phone. No contact with anyone. Let's see how long your little tantrum lasts.""

He slammed out.

I collapsed on the bed, tears sliding down in silence.

The next few days, Dominic took my phone and cut off everything.

All I had was the sun rising and setting to count down.

One day left until our agreed time.

The Sterlings threw a huge party—celebrating Vanessa's pregnancy and officially making Dominic their adopted son.

I packed what little I had.

The second I zipped it closed, the door exploded open.

""Dominic—what are you doing?"" My heart jumped.

""Vanessa says Marcus's jade bracelet is missing. The housekeeper saw you in her room this morning.""

""You're trying to upset her so she'll miscarry, aren't you!""

His accusation froze me solid.

""What are you talking about?""

But Dominic already had me by the arm, dragging me to the Sterling estate.

Vanessa's dad Robert Sterling sat at the head of the table. Vanessa sobbed beside him.

The housekeeper pointed at me the second I walked in.

""That's HER! I saw her coming out of Miss Sterling's room!""

""She can't get pregnant herself, so she got jealous and tried to hurt Miss Sterling!""

Robert's voice boomed: ""Dominic! Is this true?""

I couldn't breathe.

""I haven't left the house in days! I haven't been near anyone!""

Vanessa immediately whimpered.

""Sister-in-law, if you don't want my baby, just say it! I can give it up. Why steal my brother's keepsake?""

Her mom Helen's face went dark.

""Our Marcus died at twenty saving Dominic's life. Left us with no heir. Now Vanessa's finally pregnant and you have to ruin it?""

Robert roared: ""Dominic! You owe us an explanation!""

Something flickered in Dominic's eyes.

Then his voice went cold.

""Sophia. Hand it over.""

When I stayed silent, he picked up a wooden punishment rod.

My face drained of color. I grabbed his sleeve, voice breaking.

""A few words from them and you believe I did it?""

He stiffened. Doubt flickered—

Right then Vanessa cried out.

""Brother... It's really heart...""

Instantly, Dominic shook me off. The rod came down hard.

""Talk!""

My heart hit rock bottom.

CRACK.

The pain nearly knocked me out cold.

He didn't even flinch—just turned Vanessa away.

""Don't watch. Bad for our little one.""

Through the agony, I remembered that Valentine's Day.

Fireworks over the whole city. Dominic holding my hand promising.

""If I get to spend this life with you, I'll never betray you.""

CRACK.

The second hit.

I remembered that year a massive typhoon hit. He drove two thousand kilometers just to bring me home.

CRACK.

Third hit.

That night I had a fever. He stayed by my bed till dawn, eyes red, whispering: ""When you hurt, I hurt worse.""

Again and again. Blood soaked the floor.

The heart that once bu//rned for him shattered bit by bit.

Every guest's eyes stabbed into me.

Pity. Mockery. Satisfaction.

The former Hart family princess—stripped of her last shred of dignity in front of the entire Manhattan's elite.

Right before I lost consciousness, I heard my own voice—weak but clear.

""Dominic... we're... done!""

He didn't answer. Just signaled for the bodyguards to drag me out.

As everything faded, a familiar scent of cedar rushed close.

Then strong arms lifted me up firmly.",1,1769149420.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

True Heiress Returns to Her ""Unemployed"" Rich Family


Chapter 1 Kicked Out


On the day Arabella Macdonald left, she thought she could slip away from the Macdonald Villa quietly.

But her adoptive mother, Freya Macdonald, called her in right before her departure.

Seeing the Macdonald family's true daughter, Harper Macdonald, curled up on the sofa with Dylan Johnston, the playboy heir of the Johnston family, Arabella understood everything instantly.

The Macdonald family and the Johnston family had an existing engagement.

Dylan had always claimed to be her fiancé, showering her with attention since high school.

He pulled out all the stops to win her over.

And yet, Harper had been back for less than a week, and he was already wrapped around her finger.

He never liked me. He just liked the title 'the Macdonald family's daughter'.

Seeing Arabella had noticed, Freya didn't bother hiding anything.

""Arabella, you can see for yourself,"" Freya said. ""Harper and Dylan are simply a better match.

""The engagement with the Johnston family was originally for you. But you and Dylan never had any spark. Harper and he connected almost immediately.

""You can't force it. Fate decides who belongs with whom.

""I expect you won't cause any trouble for Dylan going forward. The two of them will be announcing their engagement soon.""

Arabella had thought they had something important to say. She raised a mocking eyebrow. ""You should be saying this to Dylan. He's the one who's been clinging to me for years. I have zero interest in him.""

A snake like him? I've seen through him long ago.

Trash like that, anyone can have him.

Being looked down on by Arabella for years had filled Dylan with resentment.

Now that she was exposed as a fake, her haughty attitude infuriated him.

He sneered, ""Listen to the impostor, talking big!

""No wonder I never felt a spark all these years. You are a fraud!

""Thank God we never finalized the wedding plans. Imagine if I'd ended up married to a counterfeit!""

He ridiculed her status with disgust, though inwardly he felt a pang of regret.

Arabella's looks and figure are miles above Harper's.

What a waste that she isn't the real daughter of the Macdonald family.

Hearing his shameless words, Arabella couldn't help but laugh coldly. ""I should be the one saying that. Thank goodness someone stepped in to take out the trash—saved me from having to look at that pizza face of yours any longer.""

""You!"" Dylan's pockmarked face twisted with rage.

Seeing her boyfriend being mocked, Harper felt spiteful but put on a show of sympathy. ""Dylan, don't be so harsh. You'll hurt Arabella's feelings.

""If I hadn't come back, I wouldn't have 'taken' you from her, or her place as the Macdonald daughter.""

""Anything she says now comes from a place of pain. Just let it go."" Harper played the understanding one perfectly.

Arabella looked at her and cut her performance short. ""My feelings aren't hurt. That garbage chased me for seven or eight years, and I never gave him a second glance. But you? You latched onto him in a week. Trash meets scheming bitch. A perfect match.""

This directly provoked Freya. ""You ungrateful wretch! Such a vicious tongue!

""No wonder I could never warm up to you. You're ill-mannered at your core!

""You took Harper's place and lived in luxury for eighteen years. She suffered in a sanitation worker's home. And you dare speak to her like that?

""Outrageous!""

Being scolded, Arabella's gaze only grew colder and more indifferent.

The ""luxury"" she enjoyed in the Macdonald family was entirely self-made.

Her adoptive father, Carter Macdonald, was a terrible businessman. He was hardworking in his youth and saved up to open a factory, but he had no real business sense.

If not for her secret assistance, that factory would have gone under at least eight times over.

The Macdonald family would never have moved to Doranor City, let alone become one of the three biggest merchants in the Meridian District.

But Arabella had never told Carter and Freya any of this. They had no idea the factory's biggest investor was her.

Carter hadn't wanted to get involved, but the arguing downstairs forced him to make an appearance.

He came down, deliberately frowning at Freya to look like the good guy. ""Enough. Is that any way to talk to her?

""Arabella is going back to her birth family today. She'll have enough hardships. We're the ones who made the mistake all those years ago. It's not her fault. Don't send her off with such coldness.""

Though his kindness was an act, Carter was at least being fair.

Still, looking at Arabella, his feelings were complicated. I have always been fond of her. She has been a lovely child.

But if she hadn't been here, we wouldn't have gone eighteen years without looking for our real daughter. Harper wouldn't have suffered so much then.

He sighed, ""Arabella, you may not be my blood, but I raised you for eighteen years. In my heart, you're still a daughter to me.

""I've made some inquiries. Your birth parents seem to be unemployed. If you ever need help in the future, don't hesitate to come to me."" It was a hollow offer, pure hypocrisy.

Freya immediately elbowed him, standing up. ""Why are you being so charitable? They'll latch onto you like leeches!""

Parents with no proper jobs? What kind of family is that?

Arabella looked at the hypocritical Macdonald family and Dylan, her expression detached. ""That won't be necessary, Mr. Macdonald. If anything, you should be more careful managing the factory and the company from now on. Especially... watch the people closest to you.""

Her eyes flickered toward Freya, her meaning clear.

There was a real snake in the company.

Freya and her older brother had been embezzling for years. If Arabella hadn't been secretly keeping watch on them, they would have drained half the company's funds by now.

If her birth family were truly poor, she wouldn't have the time to watch over the Macdonald family's interests anymore.

Hearing this, Freya exploded. ""You just can't stand to see us do well, can you? Cursing the company on your way out? Talking as if you ever managed your dad's factory? Who do you think you are?""

Arabella knew arguing with Freya was pointless. She just snorted, ""You'll find out exactly who I am soon enough.""

Let's see how tough you are then.

Tired of the talk, Arabella stood up and slung her only backpack over her shoulder.

It held just her documents and the laptop she bought herself. She was taking nothing else.

Dylan, however, couldn't resist a final jab. ""Mr. Macdonald, Mrs. Macdonald, she's not taking any luggage. That bag might be stuffed with valuables. You should probably check it.""

Let's see how high and mighty she is after a search.

Freya seized on the idea. ""Dylan's right! Open it up. Let's see what's inside.""    


Chapter 2 Fawning Over That Impostor


Harper quickly put on an act. ""Mom, isn't that a bit much? Arabella's family is so poor. Even if she took a few things, it would just help her get by. Let it go.""

Freya sneered, ""Everything in her room was bought by your father and me. What right does she have to use our things to 'get by'? Her parents are unemployed. A few trinkets won't fix that.""

With that, Freya moved to check Arabella's backpack.

But Arabella, as if expecting this pettiness, simply opened the bag herself. ""There's nothing from the Macdonald family in here. My ID is mine. This laptop, and the clothes I'm wearing, were bought with my scholarship money.""

If she hadn't been the one supporting the entire household all these years—and didn't want to leave them a cent—she would have thrown money in their faces.

But they weren't worth it.

Seeing Arabella truly had taken nothing, Harper and Dylan looked disappointed.

She actually has some pride.

With the Macdonald family speechless, Arabella shouldered her backpack to leave.

But then a weak voice called from the stairs. ""Arabella... Wait...""

The family turned, stunned.

It was Edward Macdonald, who had just had major surgery, hurrying downstairs.

Seeing her precious son, Freya rushed to support him. ""Edward! It's nothing important. You should be resting. Why did you come down?""

Edward had severe aplastic anemia. He'd recently had a bone marrow transplant performed by a reclusive specialist. The surgery was successful, but he was in recovery—a time when stress and exertion were dangerous. They'd deliberately kept him from seeing Arabella off.

Yet here he was.

Seeing her frail older brother, who had always protected her, a ripple of emotion stirred in Arabella's cold heart. She paused.

Edward shot Freya an annoyed look. ""If you hadn't had Albie babysit me, I wouldn't have had to rush.""

The butler, Albie Allan, had refused to let him come down. He'd only managed by sending Albie away.

He was just glad Arabella was still there.

Without ceremony, Edward pulled out a bank card and pressed it into Arabella's hand.

He said, ""Arabella, Dad told me. Your birth parents don't work. Your brothers... don't seem to have proper jobs either. Some are still in school. I'm worried you'd have no money over there. This is my savings. Take it, for emergencies.""

Holding the card, Arabella felt a genuine warmth.

So, in this whole family, only Edward truly cares about me.

It made all her efforts to research his illness and ensure his surgery was successful worth it. Leaving him was her only real regret.

Seeing Edward give money away, Freya panicked. ""You foolish boy! What are you doing? That's your only card! There's at least a hundred thousand dollars in there. Why give it to her? She's not your real sister!""

Hearing this, Harper grew anxious but played the victim. ""Edward is so kind... so generous to Arabella. He's barely spoken to me since I came home.""

Seeing her upset, Dylan jumped in. ""Edward, you're way too biased. You're cold to your own sister but fawning over that impostor?""

""You!"" Edward, insulted, was immediately furious.

Seeing Edward's anger, Arabella's eyes darkened. She picked up a glass of water and threw it in Dylan's face.

Dylan, the Johnston family heir, had never been treated like this. He roared in outrage, ""Arabella! How dare you!""

But Arabella's gaze was icy and terrifying. ""Dylan, this is the Macdonald Villa. Who do you think you are, yelling at the master of the house? Edward just had major surgery. He can't get agitated. Watch your mouth!""

Dylan, relying on the two families' long friendship, had always overstayed his welcome at the villa. First, it was to pester her. Now, with Harper by his side, he'd become even more brazen. But daring to speak to Edward like that? He was overstepping.

Knowing he'd offended Edward, and seeing the dark looks on Carter and Freya's faces, Dylan backed down.

Harper seized the chance to stir the pot. ""Mom, Dad, even if she was defending Edward, Arabella went too far. Throwing water? So rude.""

Harper really knows how to twist the knife.

Arabella had had enough. She pressed the card back into Edward's hand. ""Edward, you need to focus on recovery. Buy yourself some proper supplements. Keep the money for yourself.""

""Arabella..."" Edward tried to protest, but Arabella firmly gripped his hand.

For a girl, her grip was surprisingly strong. He couldn't pull free.

Arabella gave him a sincere smile, saying, ""I appreciate the thought. But Edward, don't worry. I'm not short on money. Take good care of yourself after I'm gone.""

With that, she released his hand.

Edward, flustered, tried to give her the card again.

But Arabella was already walking away, her departure as cool and decisive as her demeanor.

Dylan muttered bitterly, ""'Not short on money'? Still playing the big shot even now? Arabella, you're such a phony!""

The words had festered for seven or eight years. Finally saying them didn't make him feel better, though.

That wretched woman, splashing me even on her way out. Damn it!

Seeing his embarrassed state, Harper quickly fetched a handkerchief to dab his face.

Freya, seeing Edward had the card back, snatched it. ""Thank goodness she has some shame. Could you imagine the loss?""

Outside, seeing no driver of the Macdonald family was going to offer her a ride, Arabella pulled out her phone to call a car.

But just then, a sleek, black, unmarked sports car pulled up.

She couldn't identify the make, but the engine's purr told her it was no ordinary vehicle.

In the sunlight, the black paint had a deep, luminous sheen.

The color and finish whispered of hidden luxury.

The tires and rims were high-end, too.

This was clearly a custom, modified car for the ultra-wealthy, easily worth as much as a Bugatti or Lamborghini.

Did some big shot just arrive?

To Arabella's surprise, the man who got out looked anything but a big shot. He was dressed shabbily, with dark circles under his eyes.

He wasn't much older than her, maybe four or five years, but he was unshaven and seemed generally worn out. Despite his disheveled appearance, his eyes were sharp and alert.

They landed on Arabella, and a flicker of surprise passed through them. ""You must be Arabella, right?"" he asked.  


Chapter 3 Dislocating the Scumbag's Arm


He continued, ""You and Mom... You really look like twins.""

His family said they'd send someone to pick up Arabella today. He'd just finished a case and was on leave, so he offered to swing by and get her. That way, the family could just wait and welcome them both home.

He thought he might need an introduction at the Macdonald Villa. But one look at Arabella, and he knew.

Seeing the man's face, which bore a clear resemblance to her own, Arabella raised an eyebrow. ""You're... my brother?""

Alfred Hamilton quickly introduced himself, ""Yes. I'm Alfred Hamilton, your third brother.""

Only then did Alfred notice Arabella's odd look. He glanced down and remembered.

Right. I've been on a stakeout for that drug lord for days. Barely slept, and haven't changed clothes. I just came straight here. Too tired on the drive to even think about buying a new suit.

""Sorry, I came in a rush. Forgot to change..."" Alfred was cold and indifferent in his unit, an unyielding leader. But here, in front of his little sister, he felt uncharacteristically embarrassed.

Arabella was about to say it was fine when Harper's voice piped up from behind them. ""Where did this beggar come from? Security! How did you just let someone wander in?""

The villa's security guard hurried over. ""Ms. Macdonald, he said he was here to pick up Arabella. So I let him through.""

Hearing this, Harper turned to Arabella with feigned surprise. ""Oh... Arabella, I'm so sorry. I didn't know this was your family. Please don't mind what I just said.""

Arabella looked at her coldly. ""If you're sorry, then shut up. No one wants to hear you talk.""

With that, she walked past Harper, opened the passenger door of Alfred's car, and tossed her backpack inside.

Dylan had followed them out, eager to get back at her for the water incident.

Seeing Alfred's car with no visible brand logo, he sneered, ""Well, well. I've never seen a car without a badge. Did your family assemble this themselves in the backyard?""

Alfred, still leaning tiredly against the car, replied calmly, ""Actually, yes. We did.""

They were special forces. Every vehicle was heavily modified. His, in particular, had been designed by their fifth brother, Daniel Hamilton.

Daniel was still a PhD student but was already a weaponry design expert earmarked by the Defense Department. The weapons and vehicles he designed, once modified, were exceptionally powerful and had unmatched performance—they could even save your life in a crisis. So this car's value far exceeded any luxury vehicle on the market, and its modification cost alone rivaled a supercar's.

Dylan, of course, missed the meaning entirely. He kept mocking Arabella. ""I'm shocked your family even has a car. But with no logo... maybe it's stolen?""

Harper played along, pretending to be concerned. ""Arabella, you should be careful. What if you accidentally become an accessory? You could get in serious legal trouble.""

Arabella was rolling her eyes.

Their nonsense inside was bad enough. Now they're outside, taunting my family?

She'd had enough.

But before she could speak, Alfred's expression darkened. He walked straight toward them.

Alfred was over six feet tall. Standing in front of Dylan, he seemed like a giant. He clapped a heavy hand on Dylan's shoulder and said, ""Kid, you can eat whatever you want, but you can't say whatever you want. Did no one ever teach you that?""

Years of running devil training for his team and interrogating prisoners had earned Alfred a nickname—Ruthless Death. The look on his face now made Dylan feel like he might wet himself.

He'd never seen anyone with such a terrifying presence.

""I... I was just... speculating..."" he said.

Alfred snorted, ""Speculating? This country may have free speech, but you're legally responsible for every word you say. If your parents didn't teach you, I can.""

As he spoke, the hand on Dylan's shoulder tightened slightly.

There was a sickening crack. Dylan's shoulder was dislocated in an instant.

Dylan felt like his arm had vanished. Excruciating pain made him shriek. ""Ah! Okay! I won't! Let me go!""

Only then did Alfred, his face still cold, sharply pull the arm back into place.

Dylan was now pale and speechless with fear. But Harper still hadn't understood what was going on.

Alfred glanced sideways at Harper. She shuddered violently.

His eyes are terrifying.

""Little girl,"" Alfred said, his voice low. ""I don't hit women. I'll let you off today. Next time I see you, keep your mouth clean. I don't like anyone cursing my family.""

Talking about my sister getting in serious legal trouble?

You're asking for it.

Harper could only nod, thoroughly cowed.

Alfred finally released the coercion. He turned back to Arabella with a warm smile. ""Arabella, let's go.""

Arabella looked at his smiling face. It was hard to believe this was the same intimidating man from moments ago.

Alfred is definitely not ordinary.

But since he has handled Dylan and Harper, I should play the sweet little sister.

""Okay, Alfred."" She climbed into the passenger seat with a smile.

Alfred didn't think much of it. He got in the driver's side, buckled up, and drove away from the Macdonald Villa.

Harper and Dylan were left behind, watching the car disappear, their hearts still pounding.

""What was that guy?"" Dylan muttered, moving his now-functional arm, the fear lingering.

Harper shook her head. ""I don't know. But his license plate... I think it was a Doranor City plate. And... it looked like a government plate.""

That's so strange. He looked so scruffy. How could he be driving a Doranor City government vehicle?

""You must have seen wrong."" Dylan shook his head. He'd been too scared to notice details, but his gut said she was mistaken.

Arabella's birth family is supposedly full of unemployed drifters. How could they afford a Doranor City plate? Only locals can get those.

Getting residency in Doranor City isn't for ordinary people. You are either born into wealth or married into it. The Macdonald family is rich, but even they have out-of-town plates.

Arabella's family has to be dirt poor. There is no way they are Doranor City locals.

So she must have been seeing things.


Chapter 4 Is This for Real?


In the car, Alfred, still feeling a bit awkward, said, ""Sorry about that, Arabella. I came in such a hurry. I forgot to change. I know I'm a mess. Didn't mean to make you the subject of gossip.""

He'd never cared about his appearance before. But he couldn't embarrass Arabella like that again.

Arabella gave an understanding shake of her head. ""It's fine. Clothes should be comfortable, that's all.""

Alfred immediately felt more fond of her.

Noticing she only had the backpack, he asked, ""Arabella, is that all your luggage? Just the one bag?""

Arabella nodded, her tone cool. ""I didn't want a single thing from the Macdonald family.""

Alfred was highly observant. He caught the edge in her voice, and his eyes turned cold.

Did that family make her unhappy?

Then he said gently, ""It's okay. Once we're home, I'll buy you anything you want.""

Arabella offered a warm smile. ""Okay.""

Whatever my family's real situation is, at least Alfred seems genuinely kind.

Arabella noticed the route Alfred was taking. She couldn't help asking, ""Alfred, isn't this the road to Oceanview Peak?""

Oceanview Peak was where Doranor City's wealthiest, most powerful, and most prestigious families lived.

The Peak was enormous, covering almost the entire Sunspire District. Driving up the winding road, they passed massive villa clusters and luxurious estates.

The Macdonald family, new to the city, had made it their mission to learn that Doranor City's ten oldest, most influential families were all clustered here in the Sunspire District.

The problem was that the roads up the mountain had security checkpoints. Unless you were a resident or had an invitation from one, you couldn't enter Oceanview Peak.

Yet their car only paused briefly at a checkpoint. The license plate was scanned, and the gate lifted immediately.

Alfred answered her question casually, ""Yeah. Mom and Dad are waiting for us at home.""

Arabella's eyebrows shot up.

My home is on Oceanview Peak?

I am starting to doubt Carter's investigative skills.

Aren't my parents and brothers supposed to be unemployed drifters?

How could Carter not even know where they live?

Carter was notoriously incompetent. That was why Arabella had had to manage the company from the shadows.

He probably just heard 'unemployed' and made up the rest in his head.

Well, this is good. If my family is well-off, I won't have to worry about supporting them.

They passed several impressive villas. She expected the car to stop, but it didn't.

Then she saw the bigger villas. Okay, so they're a bit wealthier than I thought.

Alfred drove for another ten minutes. They left the villa zone and entered the sprawling estate area. Arabella narrowed her eyes.

Alright. My new family isn't just wealthy. They're seriously wealthy.

Just as that thought settled, the car kept going.

It finally reached the very summit of the peak.

Oceanview Peak got its name because this top road was completely unobstructed, with clear ocean views on both sides.

And at the end of this road stood only one estate.

It was a landmark visible from downtown Doranor City—Cloudrise Manor.

It was iconic because it sat at the city's highest point. From downtown, you could see this castle-like structure against the sky.

It was said to have been personally overseen by Howard Martin, the world's top architect. It was an extremely luxurious, hyper-modern landmark. From this castle, you could see the sunrise over the ocean in the morning and the most stunning sunset in the evening—hence the name.

The owner was shrouded in mystery. Rumors said even Doranor City's top ten families couldn't compare. No one knew who owned Cloudrise Manor, only that its owner was fabulously wealthy, with investments in every industry, but no family company of their own. Everything was handled by a team of top-tier butlers and stewards.

No one had ever seen the owner. Their family's true identity was unknown.

Arabella assumed Alfred was just driving her up to see the view. She expected they'd pass by and head down to the other side of the mountain.

Instead, Alfred turned the car through the gates into the museum-like estate.

Under the sun, water danced in the central fountain, catching the light.

The sculpture at its center was a modern masterpiece, clearly worth a fortune.

Even Arabella, accustomed to valuables and authenticity, knew it was top-tier.

Alfred brought the car to a smooth stop right before the castle's grand entrance.

Before Arabella could process it, Alfred got out and walked around to open her door like a gentleman. ""Arabella, welcome home.""

As he spoke, two lines of more than twenty servants flanking the red carpet at the entrance bowed in unison. ""Welcome home, Ms. Hamilton!""

For a second, Arabella thought she'd walked onto a movie set.

""Alfred... this... is my home?""

Is this for real?

Even with ample funds in her own accounts and plenty of experience with grand settings and important people, Arabella was stunned.

She had prepared herself for a run-down house, unemployed parents and brothers, and the responsibility of supporting them all.

But she never expected a complete 180-degree turn.

My family is the legendary, mysterious top-tier wealthy family of Doranor City?


Chapter 5 What if We Scared Her?


Seeing Arabella's surprised expression, Alfred gave an indulgent smile. ""Yes, this is your home. Come on in. Mom and Dad are waiting.""

Arabella took a steadying breath and got out of the car. Looking at the extravagant red carpet at her feet, she stepped onto it a bit awkwardly. ""This is... quite a welcome.""

Alfred smiled, ""It's only right.""

After all the hardship she has endured for so many years, her first homecoming deserves to be special.

As they spoke, two figures rushed out from behind the tall doors at the end of the carpet.

""Is that Arabella?"" Came an excited, melodic female voice.

Arabella looked up to see a middle-aged woman in a simple but elegant dress approaching. She was beautiful and graceful.

Though past forty, she was impeccably maintained, radiating a star-like, gentle charm.

Beside her was a distinguished-looking middle-aged man, tall and handsome, bearing a strong resemblance to Alfred.

Arabella knew instantly—these were her parents.

Seeing them, the perfect image of an aristocratic couple, her image of ""unemployed drifters"" completely vanished.

Carter, could you be any more incompetent?

Is this what 'unemployed drifter' looks like?

By now, Florence Hamilton had reached Arabella. She took Arabella's hands in hers, her eyes instantly welling up. ""It's true. This is my daughter. Jonathan, look how much she resembles me.""

Jonathan Hamilton studied Arabella's face, so similar to Florence's, and nodded in wonder. ""Yes. The likeness is remarkable.""

Florence had been an internationally renowned star in her day, known for her extraordinary beauty.

At first, they'd never doubted Naomi Hamilton was their biological child.

But after puberty, as Naomi grew to look less and less like either Florence or Jonathan, whispers began. They, too, started to sense something was off.

They had just begun looking into it when the Macdonald family discovered the mix-up. The police compared their DNA with Arabella's, confirming she was their biological daughter.

They'd planned to run another test after she arrived. But now, seeing her, it seemed unnecessary.

Arabella was the spitting image of a young Florence.

Without a trace of makeup, she was stunningly beautiful in a pure, natural way.

Arabella was equally surprised by how much she looked like her mother.

No wonder Freya and I were never close. I was cute as a child and grew up looking nothing like her. She probably suspected I wasn't hers all along.

Once that suspicion took root, Arabella investigated and found out the truth.

It seemed this time, she had truly found her birth parents.

""Dad, Mom, it's windy out here. Let's go inside,"" Alfred suggested gently.

Being a seaside estate, the ocean breeze was strong. He didn't want Florence catching a chill.

Florence nodded eagerly. ""You're right! I was so excited I forgot. Come inside, dear.""

Still holding Arabella's hand, she led her through the doors.

Feeling Florence's soft, warm hand, Arabella felt an unexpected wave of warmth.

Growing up despised by Freya, she'd rarely experienced a mother's care and affection.

Now she realized a mother's touch could feel so comforting.

The group moved inside.

They passed through an entrance hall that felt more like an art gallery. The walls were lined with paintings, each flanked by ceramic or sculptural pieces.

Passing one particular ceramic artwork, Arabella paused.

This piece... looks familiar.

Noticing Arabella's gaze, Florence said, ""Arabella, do you like it?""

Arabella hesitated, then nodded awkwardly.

Like it? Well, I liked it enough when I made it. Or I wouldn't make it.

But she made so many pieces each month, bundling them off to her studio assistant to sell. This one had taken her, at most, three hours.

To think it ended up in my own parents' home... What a coincidence.

""If you like it, we can move it to your room later,"" Florence offered. ""It's a top work by a mysterious new artist. I bought it at a charity auction last month for eight million dollars. Not terribly expensive, but wonderfully creative.""

Arabella's mouth twitched.

Eight million dollars... 'Not terribly expensive'?

Even as one of Meridian District's top three merchants, the Macdonald family won't casually spend eight million dollars on such a small piece.

And it is just something I threw together.

Just how wealthy is my family?

They arrived in the grand living room.

A dozen servants stood in two lines.

One group held trays with various beverages—different types of coffee and juices. The other held trays of assorted pastries.

Florence guided Arabella past them, her voice soft. ""It's your first day home, sweetheart. I didn't know what you'd like to drink, so I had them prepare every type of coffee and juice. And these pastries are from the best patisserie in Doranor City. I got one of each flavor for you to try.""

Under Florence's expectant gaze, Arabella felt obliged to choose. She picked a hand-ground coffee and two pastries.

She said, ""I don't like things too sweet. The matcha and osmanthus flavors look just right.""

Florence was delighted. ""I can't believe it! Even your tastes are like mine.""

It really is family. How did I not notice how different Naomi's preferences were?

The chosen servants presented the items, and the others dispersed.

Alfred said, ""Mom, Dad, I'm going to go change.""

Jonathan looked at his disheveled state and sighed, ""You're the leader of INTERPOL's Special Unit A now. What sort of case is this that has you personally leading the team to look like this? Had I known you were in this state, I wouldn't have let you pick up Arabella. What if we scared her?""

At his words, Alfred looked awkward. ""This was an international drug lord bust. It wasn't just me, even the...""
