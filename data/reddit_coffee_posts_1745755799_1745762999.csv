1k94rxt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k94rxt,I baked a chocolate-carrot cake today (had this at a cafe last year for my birthday and I wanted to give it a try),"So I had no eggs at the moment and I decided to try eggless.

I can only tell the ingredients but not the measurements because I have been baking for almost 7 years and it's just eye measurement for me so I apologise for that üòÖ

Take a huge bowl and add Jaggery powder+cocoa powder+coffee grounds+curd+buttermilk+milk and whisk it until all these ingredients are combined together and form a good foam.

Coming to the dry ingredients, I used all purpose flour+finger millet flour+semolina all combined with both baking powder and soda .

Now add some grated carrots to the dry ingredients and mix it well without lumps and then shift them to the wet mix and combine together and the cake batter is ready !

Preheat the oven for 10mins at 200¬∞c and then bake the cake at 150¬∞c for 50mins.",1,1745762853.0,Baking,0,1.0,False

Disclosure: I overthink tiny details, and I am someone who picks up on the smallest details.

&nbsp;

So, I make a tattoo appointment with an artist I've never been to before; her artwork is incredible, great line work, amazing details.


Saturday rolls around, and I get there a bit early to fill out consent forms and whatnot. I see her standing there, waiting, and suddenly my legs aren't quite as stable as I'm used to them being.


[_Oh, fucking hell..._](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FfbWalSwFFM1JC%2Fgiphy.gif&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=216e4f75459b02c9a27079daafbf95a3c92d6124ea707a683a3521737b128a14) anyway!


We go to her station, and start discussing details, position, etc. Then we just start talking about life in general; our lives, music, art, books, where we grew up, things we like, dislike. Ends up we have like everything in common. We both like early mornings, neither of us were born here (in the US), we've both lost parents, we both prefer a quiet life as opposed to a bustling city, we both love nature, the smell of leaves, we both love true crime docs, we both read, etc etc. You get the picture. Great energy, lots of laughing, smiling, joking around.


At one point I ask her if she's made any friends here (she's new to the area), and the first thing she says is ""I'm not looking to make any new friends. I don't like having too many friends"".  
_Overthink Detail #01_


We keep talking, tattooing and whatnot. For what it's worth, I do make eye contact while I talk to people, in case that's relevant somehow. So does she.


She seems a little nervous the whole time though, which I realize a bit into the sesh. Jittery? She's laughing at my dumb jokes and making her own; she kept initiating conversation; so I didn't get any sense of ""I'm making her nervous in a bad way"". That wasn't what my instinct was telling me, at least.  
_Overthink Detail #02_


Well, we're finally done with the tat, and she's wiping my arm down, and she's just fumbling this simple function. She smears red ink all over my clean tattoo, and laughs. I laugh. Her: ""I had a dumb moment"", me: ""Yes, you did lol.""


She puts down the paper towel, picks the same one up, and wipes me again. With the red ink. More smear. We're both cracking up a this point. Her: ""You didn't see that"", me: ""I didn't see what? Nothing happened."". We both lol. Her: ""I don't know what's wrong with me today! I'm usually the one making fun of people, not the other way around!"".  
_Overthink Detail #03_

&nbsp;

Anyhoo, the tat is finished (looks absolutely phenomenal!), we're talking aftercare, and she remembers I was going to recommend a show. I find a piece of paper on her table, so I write the name of the show on there (What we do in the shadows).


Her: ""Ok, anything else?""


Internal monologue: _Of course. Of course there's something else!_  
_**scrawls my number below the name of the show**_


For what it's worth, I don't hit on wait staff, working people, etc. It's tacky. It can make people uncomfortable, and I'm all for people being comfortable and feeling at ease. But I broke my own rule here.


I pay her (generous tip obviously), then I head towards the exit. I thank her, and walk out the door, down the steps.


**She starts following me down the stairs**  
_Overthink Detail #04_


Internal monologue: _this is not standard procedure? What is going on here?_ But it's strangely cozy.


Later realization: maybe it's just standard procedure for that shop. They were all lovely people. Super friendly. Probably just a normal thing they do.

&nbsp;

Anyhow, we get downstairs, she follows me outside, and one of the other artist is working on the entrance door for their shop (another badass design). All three of us talk about that a bit, then the other person goes inside.


A bit of silence.


We're both waiting....

**The Fuck Up**


My brain does [this](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/t-lEezejkPM).


_Do it. Just do it! Say the words, like you're Sarah calling for the goblins!_


She likes hiking; I like hiking. She likes leaves; I like leaves. She likes nature, I like nature!


Me: ""Would you like to go on a hike some time? I live right by (park name)!""


Her: ""Oh... sure. Can I bring people?""


Realization hits like a freight train taking out some TikToker on r/WinStupidPrizes


[_...motherFUCKER_](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3NQjUzzTxoA)


Me: [""Yeah, totally. I can bring people, too. It can be a group thing!""](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.tenor.com%2FdHLw9XvddfwAAAAM%2Fcat-thumbs-up.gif&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=371f90dae519b18347ce3a7005bf119d4a641abf3d7b9f1fbdb76e9eca3d5067)


TL;DR - my brain had a short circuit, and made my mouth stupid.


The thing I wanted to actually say: ""Would you like to go grab a coffee, or tea some time? Maybe visit an art museum?""


What I probably said (translated for your convenience): ""Hey, I'm probably some serial killer, right? Let's go into the woods together.""

&nbsp;

I followed up with ""Just text me. No pressure at all, of course!"", shook her hand, and turned to walk away. She said: ""I hope I see you again"", and that's that.

**I GOOFED!**


I was in a 5 year relationship before, during and a little after Covid. I've been single for a year and a half since that ended. So, yeah... I'm probably out of practice with this stuff. Pre-Covid and post-Covid dating are completely separate beasts; not to mention, I was in an even longer relationship before that.


However, what's the best course of action here? Do I follow up with a ""Hey, this is actually what I meant. Apologies for my brain imploding in on itself and spewing forth something that only vaguely resembled sanity; hope I didn't make you uncomfortable""; something to that effect.


Or play the waiting game?

I plan on talking to my doctor, but my appointment is still some time away. I've only ever had one seizure. I was under an extreme amount of stress and that's the only trigger I can think of for it.  I will try to summarize what happened:

I woke up about 1-2am and felt off. Sat on the couch and after a few minutes, my head fell back and my body went limp. My left foot started to SLAM down on the coffee table. I remember MOST of it, but was unable to respond in any way. When the paramedics showed up, I thought I was talking to them but apparently they couldn't understand me. I ""think"" it was about 40-60 minutes before I just passed out in the ambulance, but the thing felt like it took a literal eternity and I was experiencing severe time dilation. The 2 days after were met with extreme brain fog and slow movement and lack of emotions.

Had the seizure in Dec 2022, follow by losing my job. Feel into extremely deep depression, couldn't stand the thought of finding a new job. Found a new job after 6 months and my anxiety and life felt unmanageable until I quit after about 6 months. Relationship became extremely difficult and I started to show major signs of Borderline Personality Disorder (not diagnosed yet, but have shown nearly every single symptom in past relationships as well, but was more severe this time.) Eventually lead to us breaking up after 4 years. I was acting ""not like myself."" Now I'm have an extremely hard time understanding what happened or what was going on, looking back it's all so confusing and scary. The best way I can describe it is ""I feel like someone took over my brain just to destroy my life.""

Like I said, I showed signs of BPD before, but there was something different and more severe this time. I can look back now and it feels like I just snapped or changed after my seizure, but there WAS a lot more going on, so I might just be making connections where they don't belong. It might be more fair to say my state of mind caused the seizure and not the other way around. I've experienced major disassociation or POSSIBLY psychosis during panic attacks and have just felt more mentally unstable since the seizure.",1,1745762460.0,Epilepsy,0,1.0,False

Hey MaximizeMe Fam!

So, picture this: it's 3 PM. You‚Äôre in the middle of work/study/trying to look productive ü§ì, and suddenly‚ÄîBAM‚Äîyou hit that wall. The annoying, dreaded afternoon crash hits harder than a Monday morning alarm. Sound familiar?

I've been there. Tiffany from Accounting has been there. Heck, even your dog probably feels it sometimes (or is that just nap time? üòÖ). But here's a twist‚ÄîI stumbled upon something that might just be the magic potion we've been looking for... **nasal breathing**. And no, this isn‚Äôt about *looking strange while concentrating* or *revamping your oxygen intake as a side hobby*. There's legit science backing it up!

**Why Nasal Breathing, You Ask?**

- **Cortisol Control**: Studies show it helps regulate cortisol levels, which is huge since cortisol is known for its energy-zapping tendencies. So, by taking control of your breathing, you‚Äôre essentially playing Red Rover with stress. üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- **Enhanced Focus**: More oxygen to your brain = sharper thinking. Think of it like Mario grabbing a 1-Up mushroom. üçÑ Extra boost, but less pixelated.

- **Natural Energy**: It's like a shot of espresso, minus the jitters. (Sorry caffeine lovers, there‚Äôs only so much coffee a person can drink before seeing sounds.)

**My 7-Day Adventure**

I decided to give it a whirl. For a week, I focused on nasal breathing for a few minutes each morning and whenever I felt that slump creeping in:

1. **Day 1**: Felt a bit silly, like learning how to walk again. But hey, nobody‚Äôs watching, right? (Except when your roommate stares awkwardly‚Ä¶)

2. **Days 2-4**: Started to notice subtle energy shifts. I survived my afternoon meetings without yawning like a lion.

3. **Day 5**: My focus during tasks was on point. I may or may not have finished a week's worth of laundry in one go. üôå

4. **Days 6-7**: I was a convert. It's like a mini meditation session for your brain. Who knew something so simple could have such a punch?

**Why Not Give It A Go?**

Maybe you've tried green juices, new sleep apps, or energy drinks that taste like alien goop. Nasal breathing is free, easy, and doesn't require a blender. Worst-case scenario? You breathe normally again. üòÑ Best-case scenario? You're tapping into some untapped super-energy potential.

Anyone else tried this or other unconventional tips to beat the afternoon slump? Or funny stories of mid-day sleepwalking you‚Äôd care to share? Let's chat! üëá",1,1745762396.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

It sounds silly, right? Entrepreneurs are supposed to be willpower machines. And honestly, I never had big struggles with routines like Sports 4x a week, Meditation every morning, Stretching every morning, Daily reading, Taking Supplements, Sunlight exposure, Weekend journaling etc you name it.

But waking up? It‚Äôs a disaster. Every morning when I open my eyes, it feels like a truck hit me. Brain fog so intense it feels like a migraine. Sometimes I literally have to take a painkiller just to function. My mind is still half-stuck in dreams, and my so called willpower? Totally unreachable. I feel like a different person. I end up snoozing for 15-30 minutes every single day ‚Äî and I hate it.

**I‚Äôve already gone through he basics:**

* Read ""Why We Sleep""
* Deep-dived into Huberman sleep science episodes
* Optimized my night routine (no screens, winding down properly)
* Phone in another room
* Glass of water by the bed
* Tried ""practicing"" waking up during the day (yeah, I got that desperate)
* Always have a reason to get up (I love what I do)

**This is my sleep timing:**

* Usually asleep by 12 AM, wake up at 7:30 AM ‚Üí 7.5 hours of sleep.
* Tried sleeping earlier (11 PM - 7:30 AM).
* Tried sleeping more.
* Tried sleeping less.
* **None of it** consistently helps.

**Weird discovery:**  
I sometimes feel better and more awake when I sleep LESS but wake up LATER (like 2 AM ‚Üí 8:30 AM). Waking up early, even with plenty of sleep, feels 10x harder. I feel like 8-9 AM ish is just my thing but I hate waking up so late after everyone else and already having tons of messages on my phone. And I don't really think the whole 'finished sleep cycle' thing is the problem here.

Other context:

* 2 coffees a day, none after 3 PM
* Diagnosed ADHD but never medicated

**TL;DR:**  
Waking up at 7 AM or even earlier without feeling like death is my personal Everest. Any final ideas before I lose my mind? Would love to just get up naturally after \~7 hours of sleep, without snoozing.

So a lil back story I met my husband when I was 17 and he was 23. He had recently been divorced from his ex-wife who he was only married to a year and together with for 2 years. She left him after getting pregnant by someone else (he accepted the baby after she had cheated and had plans on raising it as his own). When the child was 18m old he came home from work to find all of his ex-wife belongings and the baby's were gone and a note on the coffee table telling him she found someone else and wanted a divorce..... Fast forward to him and I getting together. I had previously met his parents, sister, and his BIL before I ever met him. They knew me bc of my godmother and we would attend their church (his dad was the preacher)..... So when my husband and I started dating I didn't think it'd be an issue, his family was always nice to me at church.... Until him and I got serious.... Any time I'd come over to visit with him and his family they would call me by the ex-wifes name and then say it was an accident (keep in mind they KNEW me). They would talk about his ex-wife and even call him and give him updates about her life at least a few times a week. I tried to brush it off, but I also let him know that it made me uncomfortable, they didn't care ..... Then we got engaged and was planning our wedding, bc my soon to be FIL was a preacher I asked he would perform our ceremony, which he was the one that married my husband and his ex-wife . He looked at me and said ""No, bc in the eyes of God he is still married and it goes against my religion!""..... Fine by me whatever.... At the wedding(2009) they were sour pusses the entire time, they didn't want any photos with me or my family and even in the pics with my husband they weren't smiling or anything...... Years ago by and they are still ""slipping up"" and calling me by his ex-wifes name and he tells them multiple times that it uncalled for, but yet they still do it ... My MIL and SIL would invite the ex-wife out for lunch or shopping dates, but never tried to connect with me. There would be times I'd just sit and cry bc I was young and never invisioned having in-laws that treated me like this. No matter what I did, they never accepted me.... In 2015 my husband and I had an agreement with my SIL to buy their house and we moved in. We were having fertility issues and in 2016 was in the process of trying to adopt through the foster care system. We had home inspections and we passed everything and was approved! The same week we got approved my SIL called my husband and said ""we decided to sell the house to someone else, you have to be out in 30 days"" we were flabbergasted and they knew we were trying to start a family and all the things we went through to be approved... We had no where to go and had to move into a camper in my mom's back yard. At the end of 2016 after living in a tiny camper for 4 months we finally found a house for rent and we moved in at the end of November. In December I found out I was 6weeks pregnant and at 8weeks the Drs told me I was miscarrying and sent me home to pass everything at home. We were absolutely shattered and heartbroken. I didn't want to attend Christmas eve events at either of our families bc I was in pain physically and emotionally. My in-laws pitched a fit for us to be there so we went. I just sat on the couch and no one said a word to me, not even a hey or anything! They told me husband I just needed to move on and get over it, I took his keys and left him there and he had to get a ride home. Christmas morning I woke up and went to the bathroom and had passed the placenta and everything. We spent 12hrs on Christmas in the ER to make sure I had finished miscarrying. After that him and I split and separated in 2018, his family had become so ugly towards me telling me it was my fault I miscarried and he started drinking heavily (they said his drinking was my fault as well). I wasn't allowed to grieve the loss of my child, I was told to get over it and suck it up numerous times. Although we were separated we still kept in contact and I got pregnant with our daughter. His alcohol drinking was out of control, but he promised if we got back together he would quit and we could be a family. So we got back together and was trying to work things out. All the while my MIL was calling me a whore behind my back and saying my daughter wasn't my husbands and wanted us to DNA test bc they wouldn't accept my daughter if it came back negative..... DNA test proved he was the father and even then they still had hesitations and was rude to me every time we were around them, most of the time they wouldn't even talk to me or acknowledge my presence..... I got pregnant with our son 2 years later and they had me do another DNA test to prove  my son was his... Again the DNA test said he was the father..... They still treated me and my kids differently and after years of disapproval and putting up with his family treating me badly I told him that I no longer want a relationship with his family, none of them! I stopped going over there and blocked them on all social media. They were furious and said he shouldn't be with me bc of not having anything to do with them... AITA for cutting them out of my life after 16 years of us being together? My husband has defended me numerous times over the years, but it never does anything and he still allows them to trash talk me and my kids. I don't even want my children around them, but he still takes them saying ""that's their family"" ..... I tried so hard to gain their approval without any positive outcome... Keep in mind they are all Christians and FIL is a preacher !!!!",2,1745761726.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Chapter 1 Shattered Crown


|| Lilac's POV ||


""Please,"" I whispered, my voice shaking as I turned to Kael. ""Let them go.""


The words felt foreign, bitter, like ashes on my tongue. I had never begged before, never thought I would have to. But for them-for my parents-I would swallow my pride.


I had begged before Kael. I had pleaded with Kael to remember the vows we made, the promises he had whispered in the dark when the world felt safe.


""You will always come first,"" he had told me, his voice a balm to my fears.


That was before Coco. Before she swept into the palace like a storm, leaving ruin in her way. He swore nothing would change, that I would still be his queen, his love. It was all a lie. A beautiful, cruel lie.


Kael's golden eyes flickered with something unreadable, gone before I could grasp it. His silence cut deeper than a blade. My hands clenched into fists, nails digging into my palms, but the pain was nothing compared to the ache inside me.


The air reeked of red fluid and betrayal, thick and suffocating. The grand hall, once a place of celebration, felt like a tomb. The towering marble pillars, carved with our pack's history, seemed to lean inward as if they, too, couldn't bear to witness this. He killed all my trusted warriors, making sure my family was left vulnerable. Flickering torchlight cast jagged shadows across the polished floor ghosts mocking me, whispering of my downfall.


My heart pounded, every beat a painful reminder of how far I had fallen. My knees buckled, and I sank to the cold stone. The impact barely registered. My dress once a symbol of my status as Luna Queen felt heavy, suffocating, meaningless now.


I lifted my gaze, and there he was. Kael. The Alpha King. My husband of five years. The man I had given everything to. His broad shoulders were squared, his jaw set, his golden eyes colder than I had ever seen. This was not the man who once held me close, who swore to protect me. No, this was a stranger wearing his face.


And in his arms, cradled like something precious, was Coco. Wrapped in silk, her raven hair spilling over her shoulders, she was breathtaking. To me, she was nothing but a viper wrapped in silk and secrets. Her lips curled into a smirk triumphant, cruel. She had unraveled my life with nothing more than a glance, watching as everything I built crumbled at her feet.


Behind them, warriors stood motionless, swords drawn, aimed at my parents. My mother and father once proud, unyielding warriors were on their knees, heads howed, Silver chains bound their wrists and ankles, the enchanted metal searing their skin. The sight of them like this-broken, humiliated was a dagger to my heart.


""He is your Beta, Kael. He is the proud of our country,"" I said.


My father, the man who had once stood tall even in the face of war, sagged under the weight of his shame. My mother's fierce eyes were hollow now, empty of hope. The woman who taught me to fight for what I loved was now nothing more than a prisoner in the kingdom she once bled for.


I swallowed hard, forcing down the sob clawing its way up. I couldn't break. Not yet.


""Kael,"" I choked out, my voice cracking. ""If you ever loved me, even a little.... let them go.""


Coco's laughter rang through the silence-sharp, mocking.


""Oh, darling,"" she purred, tilting her head. ""Love has nothing to do with this.""


She stepped forward, slow and deliberate, a predator circling its prey. In her hand, a dagger gleamed under the dim light. She pointed it at me, her smile dripping with false sweetness.


""I'll let them go,"" she mused, ""if you die instead.""


The words hit me like a punch to the gut. Before I could react, her smirk


widened.


""Too late,"" she whispered. ""I changed my mind.""


She hurled the dagger.


Time slowed. The blade spun through the air in a deadly arc.


My father's eyes met mine steady, strong, the way they had always been. But now, they were filled with sorrow. With an apology he would never get to say.


The dagger struck. A sickening thud.


A strangled gasp escaped his lips. His body jerked violently as the silver burned through him. His fingers trembled, reaching-reaching for me-but his strength faltered. He crumpled to the ground. Convulsing. Dying.


""Nol""


The scream tore from my throat, raw and broken.


I lunged for him desperate, frantic


But before I could reach him, before I could touch him one last time, Coco threw another dagger.


This one struck my mother's chest.


A sharp gasp. Her body jolted. Her trembling hands clutched at the hilt, as if she could undo it, as if she could will the blade away. Crimson bloomed across her gown, violent against the pale silk.


Her gaze found mine.


Her fierce, loving eyes the ones that had watched over me my whole life-now filled with something else. Regret. Not for herself. For me. For the pain she couldn't stop.


Her lips parted. No words came. Just a shuddering breath.


She collapsed beside my father.


A hollow, keening sound rose from my chest, a grief so raw it split me apart. My parents my home, my anchor were gone. just like that. Their lives. reduced to bloodstains on cold, unfeeling stone.


The world blurred. My vision darkened as rage and sorrow swallowed me whole. My wolf surged forward, her growl shaking the hall. My claws elongated, my fangs bared. I was ready to tear Coco apart


But Kael stepped in front of her, his massive frame shielding her from my wrath. His golden eyes bore into mine, cold and unyielding, and in that moment, I saw the truth.


I was nothing to him. My love was less than nothing.


The bond we had shared, the love I had believed in, had been an illusion, shattered by the arrival of his true mate,


Chapter 2 Fall Of The Luna


|| Lilac's POV ||


‚ÄúYou witch!‚Äù I snarled, my voice a mixture of pain and fury. My wolf howled within me, her grief echoing my own.


But Kael‚Äôs expression remained impassive, his loyalty firmly with Coco. The woman who had destroyed my life, who had taken everything from me, stood behind him, her smirk a cruel reminder of my powerlessness.


Tears streamed down my face as I looked at the bodies of my parents, their lives extinguished so callously, so cruelly. The girl who had once believed in fairy tales, in happily ever afters, was gone. 


""Tell me, Kael, was she worth slaughtering the entire Royal Beta lineage?"" I yelled.


Kael stood tall, his regal posture unyielding, his golden eyes cold and distant. How did it come to this? How had the man I had helped build an empire become the architect of my ruin?


""Answer me, Alpha King. Or do you still not see red fluid on your hands? Red fluid of your own Beta..."" my voice choaked.


I stared at him, my heart a battlefield of grief and rage. It was me who had stood by his side, it was my family who had fought for him, bled for him, and secured his place on the throne. My parents, proud and unwavering, had led armies against the dark witches on the border, their sacrifices ensuring the peace of our lands. And what had it earned them? Silver chains and a traitor‚Äôs death. What had it earned me? Betrayal. Humiliation. A love turned to ash.


""They fought for you, day and night. My father almost lof his wolf protecting pur kingdom...."" I screamed. But he remained silent as if my words couldn't even get through him.


""They were traitors,"" Kael said finally.


""Traitors? Just because Coco said so? What proof do you have?"" I growled.


""Oh dear. Looks like our Luna has lost her mind,"" Coco taunted instead and he let her.


My mind drifted to the day Coco had arrived at the palace. She had been a fragile thing then, her eyes wide with fear, her hands trembling as she knelt before me. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she had begged, her voice trembling, ‚Äúlet me stay. I have nowhere else to go.‚Äù I had been foolish, so foolish. I had seen her as a lost soul in need of shelter, not the viper she truly was. Kael had taken her in, not as a servant, but as his concubine. 


And now, here I was, kneeling before her. The irony was not lost on me. The woman I had once pitied now stood above me, her delicate features twisted into a mask of triumph. 


""So you still remember that I am the Luna and your queen,"" I growled.


""Are you?"" Coco‚Äôs lips curled into a smirk.


""Was I ever anything to you?"" The question screamed inside me, tearing at my insides like claws. ""Was any of it real?""


Kael‚Äôs gaze flickered, just for a moment, a shadow of something unreadable passing through his golden eyes. Regret? Guilt? I did not know, and I no longer cared. 


A bitter laugh bubbled up in my throat, raw and laced with sorrow.


""Tell me, Kael,"" I whispered, my voice a ghost of what it once was.


""Was it worth it? Was she worth the red fluid? Look around you... look at the red fluid in your hands."" My eyes flickered to Coco, whose smirk only deepened, satisfaction glimmering in her dark eyes.


Kael‚Äôs jaw tightened, but he said nothing. The silence was louder than any answer he could have given me.


Coco stepped closer, her silk dress swishing against the marble floor.


""You should have left when you had the chance,"" she mused, her voice like honey laced with venom. ""But I suppose you were always too stubborn for your own good. Now look at you. Broken. Defeated. Alone.""


Alone. The word echoed in my mind, a cruel mockery of everything I had once had. But she was wrong. I was not broken. Not yet. My heart still beat, my lungs still drew breath, and as long as I lived, so did my vengeance. I would not fall. Not here. Not like this.


Lifting my chin, I met Coco‚Äôs gaze head-on, letting the fury in my eyes burn as brightly as the fire in my soul.


""Enjoy your victory while you can,"" I murmured, my voice steady despite the turmoil within me. ""Because one day, Coco, you will kneel before me. And when that day comes, I will make sure you remember every drop of red fluid you spilled.""


Her smirk faltered for the briefest of moments, a flicker of uncertainty crossing her face before she masked it with a scoff. ""Empty threats from a fallen queen. How pitiful.‚Äù


I couldn‚Äôt hold back any longer. A deep, angry growl tore from my throat as I lunged at Coco, my wolf taking over. My claws slashed through the air, my fangs bared, and for just a second, I saw fear flash in her eyes.


Kael was too stunned to react fast enough. I shoved him hard, my paw slamming into his chest, sending him crashing onto his back. Then Coco was under me‚Äîsmall, fragile, trapped beneath my weight. I glared down at her, my growl echoing through the hall.


This was all her fault. She had created this nightmare. She had twisted Kael‚Äôs mind, shattered my family, taken everything from me.


Then Kael‚Äôs hand locked around my hind leg and yanked. I crashed into the wall, bones cracking as the force knocked me back into human form. I gasped, ribs screaming, my vision swimming as I tried to push myself up.


Across the room, Kael stood over Coco like some kind of knight in shining armor, his eyes blazing with fury.


At me.


I spat red fluid onto the marble floor and laughed‚Äîa raw, broken sound.


""Of course,"" I choked out. ""You‚Äôd always choose her.""


‚ÄúI denounce you as my Luna,‚Äù he declared, his words striking me with the force of a physical blow.


‚ÄúAnd I reject you as my mate. I am severing our bond.‚Äù He turned away from me, his attention focused on Coco as he lifted her from the ground, cradling her protectively in his arms. The tenderness in his touch was a dagger to my heart, a reminder of what I had lost.


‚ÄúWhat should we do with her, Alpha?‚Äù one of the warriors asked, his voice devoid of emotion.


Kael didn‚Äôt even look at me as he replied, his tone as cold as the winter wind. ‚ÄúYou can have your way with her. And once you‚Äôre done, get rid of her.‚Äù


His words shattered what little remained of my soul. I had given him everything‚Äîand this was my reward. Betrayal. Abandonment. Death. The warriors moved toward me, their eyes gleaming with malice, but I was already crawling away, my body trembling with exhaustion and despair.


My hand brushed against something cold and metallic. A dagger, forgotten on the floor. I clutched it tightly, the weight of it grounding me in the moment. My vision blurred with tears as I pressed the blade to my stomach.


‚ÄúMoon Goddess,‚Äù I whispered, my voice breaking.


‚ÄúForgive me. I was not the Luna you expected of me. Forgive me, Mom, Dad. I have failed you too.‚Äù


A single tear rolled down my cheek as I closed my eyes, the dagger poised to end my suffering. If I were to get another chance, I vowed silently, I would never walk this path again. I would never trust so easily, love so blindly. I would rise from the ashes of my shattered life, stronger, fiercer, unbroken.


But as the blade pressed into my skin, a spark of defiance ignited within me. No. I would not give them the satisfaction of my death. Not like this. Not while they still breathed. With a trembling hand, I lowered the dagger, my resolve hardening.


Goddess, was this your justice? I was the Luna Queen and that was the death I deserved! I fell slowly in a cold dark place.


Chapter 3 A Second Chance


|| Lilac's POV ||


The grand hall was a whirl of color and noise‚Äîlaughter, music, and applause bouncing off the marble floors. Golden chandeliers cast a warm glow over everything, making the velvet banners with our pack‚Äôs crest shimmer. Unity. Strength. Words that meant nothing to me now.


My head spun. One second, I‚Äôd been on the throne room floor, a dagger at my stomach, my heart in pieces. The next, I was here‚Äîback in this cursed celebration, the night that had started my ruin.


Then arms wrapped around me. Warm. Familiar. Lavender and honey.


My breath caught.


Mom.


Her embrace was soft, her voice thick with love. ""Congratulations, sweetpea.""


That word‚Äîsweetpea‚Äîhit me like a knife to the chest. I pulled back just enough to see her face, my fingers trembling as they brushed her cheek. Real. Alive. Laugh lines framed her eyes, her smile bright, her golden-flecked irises like sunlight through leaves.


But‚Äîhow? I‚Äôd watched her die. Seen Coco‚Äôs blade take her from me.


Yet here she stood. Unharmed. Or maybe we both were dead! This was the afterlife.


The applause around me swelled, a roaring wave of approval. I turned, pulse racing, and saw him‚Äîmy father. Tall, proud, his silver-streaked hair catching the light. He gave me a nod, the kind that used to make me feel safe.


Both of them. Alive. This couldn‚Äôt be truth. 


My lungs burned. Was this madness? A trick of my dying mind? 


I looked down at myself‚Äîthe shimmering gown, the same one I‚Äôd worn that night. The night Luna Queen Cassandra had named me Kael‚Äôs mate.


A memory? The most terrifying one probably! I piched myself and a gasp left asI felt the pain.


No.


This wasn‚Äôt just any memory. This was... REAL! I came back in time somehow.


Back then, I‚Äôd been naive. I‚Äôd loved Kael for as long as I could remember‚Äîbefore I even had my wolf, before I knew what love really was. I‚Äôd believed being his mate was an honor. That we‚Äôd rule together, that he‚Äôd cherish me.


I‚Äôd been so innocent.


Kael‚Äôs charm had hidden the truth‚Äîthe coldness in him, the cruelty. And I‚Äôd fallen for it, right up until the moment he betrayed me.


But now?


The realization crashed over me‚Äîthis was real. A second chance.


My hands clenched. I wouldn‚Äôt make the same mistakes. I wouldn‚Äôt trust him. I wouldn‚Äôt let Coco destroy everything I loved.


""Lilac, my dear, please step up.""


Luna Queen Cassandra‚Äôs voice cut through the noise. She stood on the stage, regal as ever.


And beside her‚Äî Kael Reventhorn.


Golden-eyed, perfect, the future Alpha King. The crowd adored him. But I saw the truth now‚Äîthe emptiness behind his smile.


The queen extended her hand. ""Today, you take your place as the future Luna of Reventhorns.""


Cheers erupted.


I met Kael‚Äôs gaze. Once, that look would have made my heart race. Now?


Nothing.


Only ice. Only resolve.


‚ÄúForgive me, my queen,‚Äù my mother‚Äôs voice broke through the silence, soft and apologetic. I turned to see her bowing slightly, her hands clasped in front of her.


‚ÄúShe is a bit overwhelmed, it seems.‚Äù Her smile was strained, her eyes darting to me with a mixture of pride and concern. I wanted to tell her the truth, to explain that this was not overwhelming but a deep, seething resistance bubbling beneath the surface. But I couldn‚Äôt. Not here. Not now.


‚ÄúIt is normal indeed,‚Äù Luna Cassandra replied, her voice smooth and reassuring.


‚ÄúLilac is only eighteen, and we are bestowing a great responsibility upon her shoulders.‚Äù Her words were kind, but they did little to ease the turmoil within me.


In my past life, this woman had been a pillar of strength, a figure I had admired and respected. But I knew the truth now. She had done everything for her son, Kael, even when it meant siding with him as he brought Coco into our lives. She had called it normal, a necessary part of life for an Alpha. ‚ÄúMy son is an Alpha and he needs his mate to keep his sanity intact,‚Äù she had said, her voice gentle but firm. ‚ÄúAnd since she is his soulmate, their child will have a stronger bond.‚Äù Her words had cut me deeper than any blade, a betrayal I had never fully recovered from.


‚ÄúGo ahead, dear,‚Äù my mother whispered, her hand squeezing my arm gently.


‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ we are not soul mates,‚Äù I finally managed to say, my voice barely above a whisper. The words hung in the air, a fragile thread of defiance that seemed to silence the entire room. I could feel the tension rise, the unease of the crowd palpable. In my past life, I had accepted this arrangement without question, too naive to see the cracks in the foundation. But now, I couldn‚Äôt let it go unchallenged.


Luna Cassandra‚Äôs smile didn‚Äôt waver, but there was a flicker of something in her eyes, surprise, perhaps, or even a hint of irritation.


‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she said, her tone still warm but with an edge of finality.


‚ÄúBut Kael has reached twenty-three, and you are eighteen. Neither of you has found your mates yet. Above all, finding mates is rare, so we must rely on chosen ones.‚Äù Her words were logical, practical, but they did nothing to ease the storm raging within me.


‚ÄúWhat if one of us finds our mate?‚Äù I asked, my voice trembling but firm. The crowd fell silent, the weight of my question settling over them like a heavy fog.


Before Luna Cassandra could respond, Kael stepped forward, his presence commanding and undeniable. His golden eyes locked onto mine, filled with a warmth that felt so genuine it made my stomach churn.


‚ÄúI will still love you and cherish you,‚Äù he said, his voice strong and unwavering. It echoed through the hall, a vow meant to reassure not just me but the entire crowd. ‚ÄúOnly you will be my Luna. I vow to the Moon Goddess that you will be the only one for me.‚Äù


His words were beautiful, poetic even, but they rang hollow in my ears. I knew this was a performance, a carefully crafted show meant to win the favor of the nobles and secure his place as the future Alpha King.


‚ÄúI will always cherish you,‚Äù he said, his voice soft but carrying the weight of a promise. ‚ÄúFrom today onwards, you will be my precious Princess.‚Äù


The crowd erupted into applause, their cheers and whistles filling the air. But to me, it felt like a funeral march, the sound of my freedom being buried beneath the weight of duty and expectation.


Chapter 4 A Spark In Shadow


|| Lilac‚Äôs POV ||


""May I?"" Kael asked, extending his hand. I forced a smile.


The crowd cheered as Kael led me to the dance floor. His grip on my hand was tight, like he already owned me. The music was soft, but I felt nothing but anger.


I hated this. I hated his fake smile, his hand on my waist, his pretend love. Every step felt like I was betraying myself.


How did I end up here again? I had a second chance to change things, but here I was, dancing with the man who ruined me. Memories of my past life came rushing back‚Äî Kael‚Äôs betrayal, his cold words as he left me to die.


‚ÄúYou dance well,‚Äù Kael whispered, his breath hot on my ear. I shivered, disgusted.


‚ÄúPractice makes everything perfect,"" I said, keeping my voice steady. In my past life, I‚Äôd learned to pretend to enjoy your company.


The music dragged on, each note a reminder of what I‚Äôd lost. When it ended, I walked away, leaving the cheers behind.


In my past life, I‚Äôd been naive. That version of me died betrayed and broken. This time, I'ld be stronger. But how could I, a beta with no power, stand against the future Alpha King?


I wandered into the garden, away from all the eyes. My mind racing. It was peaceful here than in the hall. Exhausted, I stumbled, but someone caught me. The scent of pine filled the air.  I looked up, my breath catching in my throat as my eyes met his. A pair of piercing grey, like storm clouds gathering on the horizon, filled with a quiet intensity that made my heart skip a beat. His face was sharp, his features carved with a rugged handsomeness that was both intimidating and captivating. This was Alaric. The forgotten piece of this kingdom.


I had heard the rumors, of course. Everyone had. They whispered through the halls like a ghostly echo, growing darker with each retelling.


Alaric‚Äôs mother had been the first mate of Alpha King Darius. She had been beloved by the pack, a Luna that inspired devotion and awe. But her life had been cut short in a tragedy no one dared to speak of openly. Some said illness had claimed her, others believed treachery had been involved, though no one ever pointed fingers. Not publicly, at least.


Her death had left a void in the castle, one that Darius had filled almost too quickly. Cassandra, the woman who would become the new Luna, had stepped into the role without hesitation, her delicate hands gripping the crown that once belonged to another. And just like that, Alaric had been cast aside, his presence fading into the shadows while Kael flourished under Cassandra‚Äôs reign.


They never called him a prince. He was the firstborn son of the Alpha King, yet his name was never spoken with reverence or admiration. Instead, it was whispered in hushed, fearful tones, a cautionary tale for those who dared to question the natural order.


""His soul is cursed,"" they said.


""His mate will die before she ever gets the chance to love him.""


He was nothing like Kael, no golden child, no rising Alpha. Where Kael was fire, burning bright and dazzling in his brilliance, Alaric was ice. A cold, creeping force, slipping through the cracks of the castle‚Äôs walls, lurking in places no one dared to look.


""Stay away from the king‚Äôs firstborn,"" the castle maids had warned in whispers, their hands clutching their aprons as if warding off some unseen force.


""His touch brings only death.""


And yet, as I stood there, his hands still gripping my arms, I felt no fear. Only a strange, electric warmth that spread through me, igniting something deep within my chest. His touch was firm but gentle, his presence both calming and exhilarating. I couldn‚Äôt look away from his eyes, those stormy grey eyes that seemed to see straight through me, past the fa√ßade I had built, past the pain and the anger, to the core of who I was.


A spark ran through my skin where he touched me, a sensation so intense it left me breathless. I had never felt anything like it before, not with Kael, not with anyone. It was as if the world had shifted, as if the very air around us had changed. What was this feeling? This strange, overwhelming connection that seemed to pull me toward him, as if some unseen force had tied us together?


For a moment, neither of us moved. The garden was silent, the world around us fading away until it was just the two of us, standing there in the moonlight. My heart raced, my mind struggling to make sense of what I was feeling. But one thing was clear: this was different. This was real.


And it terrified me.


The garden was peaceful. Or it would have been‚Äîif not for the voice cutting through the night.


‚ÄúI wonder what my sister-in-law is doing out here all alone.‚Äù


I stopped. My pulse kicked up, but I turned slowly. Alaric leaned against a tree, half in the shadows, smirking like he owned the place. His grip was still there on my arms as he pulled me a bit closer. Moonlight caught in his gray eyes, sharp and unreadable.


I pulled my hands free from his grip, hating the way my skin still tingled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your sister-in-law.‚Äù


He chuckled. ‚ÄúNo?‚Äù


He stepped closer. I didn‚Äôt move. He was way too taller than me, too close, too pompus.


‚ÄúI could‚Äôve sworn I saw you in my brother‚Äôs arms tonight, dancing in joy,‚Äù His tone was light, but there was something else under it.


‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a choice,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúQueen Cassandra decided that for me.‚Äù


He tilted his head. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre just a victim? No fight left in you? Oh, helpless Lilac.‚Äù


Anger flared hot. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not helpless.‚Äù


His smirk widened. ‚ÄúOf course not.‚Äù His voice dropped lower, almost amused.


I stepped back, my shoulders hitting the rough bark of a tree. He moved in, filling the space between us, bringing the scent of pine and leather with him.


‚ÄúRegretting your decision already?‚Äù His breath was warm against my cheek.


I forced a steady voice. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt regret anything.‚Äù


His eyes flickered. ‚ÄúLiar.‚Äù


He reached up, brushing a stray lock of hair from my face. My breath hitched. Too close. My eyes fell on his full lips and suddenly all I wanted to do was kissing him, running my hands in his soft dark hair.


""What are you thinking so deeply about, sister-in-law?"" He said and I saw a dangerous smike over his lips.


Focus Lilac! He was one of the Reventhorns. STAY AWAY FROM THEM AND YOU MIGHT LIVE LONGER! I yelled in my head.


""None of your business,"" I replied.


I ducked under his arm and put distance between us, my steps quick. I could feel his gaze on my back, but I didn‚Äôt turn around.


The path stretched ahead, bathed in silver light. I needed to think. To get out of this mess. There had to be a way.


But first, I had to deal with this engagement.


And I had a feeling that wasn‚Äôt going to be easy.


Chapter 5 Plan In Motion


|| Lilac‚Äôs POV ||


The morning sun lit up my room as I woke up, the shadows of a restless night still lingering. My first thought was to reach out to Runa, my wolf. But there was no response. My heart raced as I tried again, but still nothing. She was barely there. Something was wrong. Why had I been given this second chance? It didn‚Äôt make sense.


The smell of pancakes pulled me back to the present. Downstairs, I could hear the soft hum of conversation and the clinking of plates. It felt like home, like the life I‚Äôd fought so hard to protect.


I dressed carefully‚Äîa blouse, a pencil skirt, and heels. As I walked downstairs, the smell of pancakes and coffee grew stronger. My family was in the kitchen. Mom was at the stove, flipping pancakes. Dad sat at the table with his coffee, and Ezra, my younger brother, was reading a book. He looked so much like Dad, with the same dark hair and sharp features. Everything felt normal, and I wanted to keep it that way.


‚ÄúGood morning, sweetpea,‚Äù Dad said, smiling at me.


‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù I replied, sitting down.


Mom set a plate of pancakes in front of me.


‚ÄúYou look different,‚Äù she said, studying me.


I glanced down. I *was* different. The naive girl who believed in fairy tales was gone. Now, I carried the weight of a second chance.


‚ÄúI have some plans,‚Äù I said vaguely, picking up my fork.


Mom didn‚Äôt press, but her gaze lingered. Breakfast was peaceful, filled with casual chatter and the sound of forks on plates. But I couldn‚Äôt stay. I had work to do.


As I cleared the table, Ezra leaned against the doorframe. ‚ÄúWhere are you off to so early?‚Äù he asked, still in his pajamas.


‚ÄúJust some errands,‚Äù I said, waving a hand vaguely over my shoulder.


Ezra‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúErrands,‚Äù he repeated, his voice dripping with skepticism. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a suspiciously vague answer.‚Äù


I sighed, adjusting the strap of my bag. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs not that interesting.‚Äù


‚ÄúThat‚Äôs debatable,‚Äù he countered, pushing off the doorframe and stepping closer. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dressed like you‚Äôre about to go negotiate a business deal or break someone‚Äôs heart. Or both.‚Äù


I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúWow. What a range.‚Äù


He smirked. ‚ÄúI call it like I see it.‚Äù Then, his expression turned teasing. ‚ÄúWait, are you going on a date! Is this with Kael? ‚Äù


I scoffed. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not.‚Äù


He gasped dramatically, clutching his chest. ‚ÄúOh my God. Are you already cheating on him?‚Äù


I shoved him lightly, but he barely budged. ‚ÄúIt is not a date outfit, Ezra.‚Äù


‚ÄúThen why are you blushing?‚Äù he shot back, grinning like he‚Äôd won something.


‚ÄúI‚Äôm not, ‚Äù I cut myself off, realizing the more I denied it, the worse it would look. I exhaled sharply, pinching the bridge of my nose. ‚ÄúYou are so annoying.‚Äù


He grinned wider. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my job as your older brother.‚Äù


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre younger by a whole year.‚Äù I groaned. But inside my heart, it felt right. I missed his teasing.


‚ÄúAnd yet, infinitely wiser,‚Äù he grinned.


I shook my head, but despite my best efforts, a small smile tugged at my lips. This was Ezra,  relentless, obnoxious, and somehow, always able to make me laugh even when I didn‚Äôt want to.


The drive to the plaza was quiet, the hum of the engine the only sound accompanying my thoughts. Today was the day. Kael would be holding a conference here, a gathering of alphas and nobles to discuss pack alliances and future plans. It was the perfect opportunity, a chance to set my plan in motion.


I parked the car and stepped out, the cool morning air brushing against my skin as I made my way to the podium. The plaza was already bustling with activity, the press setting up their cameras and reporters milling about. My eyes scanned the crowd, and it didn‚Äôt take long to spot her.


‚ÄúLilac!‚Äù Elara‚Äôs voice rang out, bright and excited, as she hurried toward me. My best friend since childhood, she was a whirlwind of energy, her curly hair bouncing with every step. She pulled me into a tight hug, her enthusiasm infectious. She was from a Gamna family and was interested in news reporting and not to mention spying on all hot boys since our middle school.


‚ÄúHi, Elara,‚Äù I said, laughing softly as I returned her embrace. ‚ÄúI thought I would find you here.‚Äù


‚ÄúOf course, I‚Äôm here!‚Äù she exclaimed, pulling back to show me her press badge with a grin. ‚ÄúI heard you were chosen as the future Alpha King‚Äôs mate! Can you believe it? My best friend, the future Luna! This is huge, Lilac! Your dream come true moment!!!!‚Äù


I forced a smile, my stomach twisting at her excitement. ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ something,‚Äù I said, my voice carefully neutral.


Elara tilted her head, her brow furrowing slightly as she studied me. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt sound thrilled. Isn‚Äôt this what you‚Äôve always wanted?‚Äù


I hesitated, my mind racing. How could I explain to her that the life she thought I wanted was the very thing I was trying to escape? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated,‚Äù I said finally, shaking my head. ‚ÄúBut listen, I need your help.‚Äù


Her eyes lit up, curiosity replacing her earlier concern. ‚ÄúOf course! What do you need?‚Äù


I glanced around, making sure no one was within earshot before getting closer. ‚ÄúI need you to get me access to the press room. There‚Äôs something I have to do, and I can‚Äôt do it alone.‚Äù


Elara‚Äôs grin widened, her excitement undimmed. ‚ÄúConsider it done. But you owe me the full story later, okay?‚Äù


‚ÄúDeal,‚Äù I said, relief flooding through me as she linked her arm with mine and led me toward the press room.


As we walked, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a flicker of hope. This was it. The first step in changing my fate. And with Elara by my side, I knew I could do it. Whatever it took, I would protect my family. I would rewrite my story.


And maybe, just maybe, I would find a way to be free.


Chapter 6 Miracle Pill


|| Lilac‚Äôs POV ||


The press room was chaos‚Äîreporters rushing, keyboards clacking, and the smell of coffee and ink filling the air. I moved through it like a shadow, my heart racing. There was no time to hesitate. My mission was clear: plant a document that would cast doubt on Kael‚Äôs new ‚Äúmiracle pills.‚Äù If I could spark enough suspicion, it might buy me time to gather real proof before it was too late.


I spotted a messy table near the wall, papers scattered everywhere. Perfect. No one would notice one more sheet. I flipped through the pile, pretending to search for something, and slipped my document in. It was subtle‚Äîjust a few lines questioning the safety of the pills. A small spark, but enough to start a fire.


As I stepped back, my fingers tingled. Every nerve screamed at me to leave before someone noticed. I forced myself to walk calmly, blending in with the frantic energy of the room. But with each step, doubt crept in. Was this the right thing to do? Was I any better than Kael if I used deception?


Then I thought of Ezra. My brother, banished and broken because of Kael‚Äôs lies. I had failed him once. I wouldn‚Äôt let it happen again. This time, I would fight.


I slipped into the auditorium just as the conference began. The room was packed, everyone focused on Kael as he took the stage. He looked every bit the confident Alpha King‚Äîsharp suit, golden eyes, and a voice that commanded attention. He introduced the Miracle Pill, claiming it would make warriors unstoppable. The crowd erupted in applause, but I clenched my fists, remembering the truth. Those pills came at a cost‚Äîaddiction, destruction, and Ezra‚Äôs ruin.


I scanned the room and saw Alaric near the front. His grey eyes met mine, and for a moment, it felt like he could see right through me. I looked away, my cheeks burning.


When the presentation ended, the crowd buzzed with excitement. I stayed in my seat, planning my next move. Then Alaric appeared beside me, his smirk as annoying as ever. ‚ÄúImpressive, isn‚Äôt he?‚Äù he said, his tone dripping with sarcasm.


I forced a smile. ‚ÄúHe knows how to work a crowd.‚Äù


Alaric‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúAnd what about you, Dove? What are you up to?‚Äù


Before I could answer, Kael called my name. He was walking toward me, his golden eyes fixed on mine. ‚ÄúLilac,‚Äù he said, his voice warm but with an edge. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking for you.‚Äù


I stood, my heart pounding. ‚ÄúCongratulations on the presentation,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice steady.


Kael smiled, but his eyes were sharp. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù He glanced at Alaric. ‚ÄúBrother. Didn‚Äôt expect to see you here.‚Äù


Alaric smirked. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt miss it.‚Äù


The tension between them was thick. I glanced between them, unsure how to defuse it.


Kael turned back to me. ‚ÄúLilac, join me for a meeting with the nobles. Your insight would be valuable.‚Äù


I hesitated. This was a test. Kael was testing my loyalty. I couldn‚Äôt refuse without raising suspicion.


‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I said, forcing a smile.


As I followed Kael, I glanced back at Alaric. His grey eyes held mine, and for a moment, I felt a flicker of hope. He was watching me, a silent reminder that I wasn‚Äôt alone.


Whatever came next, I wouldn‚Äôt let Kael win. Not this time.


-------


The meeting room was quiet, a sharp contrast to the noisy auditorium outside. The dark wood walls and flickering chandelier light gave the space a heavy, serious feel. The smell of expensive cologne and coffee filled the air, adding to the tension.


I stood beside Kael at the head of the table, playing my part as the loyal future Luna. The nobles and alphas around us watched him with admiration and greed. The Miracle Pill wasn‚Äôt just a product‚Äîit was a symbol of Kael‚Äôs power and vision. Everyone wanted a piece of it.


But beneath my calm exterior, my heart raced. The document I‚Äôd planted in the press room had done its job. Now, I had to wait and see if the seeds of doubt would grow.


The meeting started smoothly. Papers were passed around, and the nobles nodded as they reviewed the numbers. Pens clicked, ready to sign. I kept my hands clasped, nails digging into my palms under the table.


Then, a voice cut through the room.


‚ÄúThis is incredible work, but I can‚Äôt approve it.‚Äù


All eyes turned to Alpha Asher. He was one of the strongest alphas, known for his integrity. His words carried weight.


‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù another alpha asked, confused. ‚ÄúThis is a great opportunity.‚Äù


Asher leaned forward, his blue eyes sharp. ‚ÄúThe pill was only tested on two rogues, and they both died. A pill this powerful comes with a price.‚Äù He paused, his gaze locking onto Kael. ‚ÄúAnd I found traces of wolfsbane in it.‚Äù


The room went silent. Wolfsbane, even in small amounts, was dangerous for werewolves. It weakened them over time, corroding their strength and bond with their wolf.


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs reckless,‚Äù Asher continued. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt risk my people with this.‚Äù


The silence grew heavier. Cameras clicked, capturing every tense moment. The media, here for promotion, now had a scandal.


Murmurs turned to whispers, then accusations.


‚ÄúIs this true?‚Äù one alpha demanded.


‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you mention this, Kael?‚Äù another noble asked, his tone sharp.


Kael‚Äôs jaw tightened, but he forced a smile. I could see the crack in his calm facade.


I looked down at the document in my hands, my heart pounding. This was my moment. I let my fingers tremble slightly, as if I were just realizing the truth. I took a shaky breath and looked up at Kael, my eyes wide with feigned shock.


‚ÄúKael,‚Äù I said softly, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all here‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs wolfsbane in the ingredients.‚Äù


The room erupted. Voices rose, questions flying like daggers.


‚ÄúIs this true?‚Äù


‚ÄúWolfsbane? How could this happen?‚Äù


‚ÄúYou said it was safe, Kael!‚Äù


Chaos filled the room, and I stayed quiet, watching as Kael‚Äôs carefully built image began to crumble.",1,1745761531.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1k94avv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k94avv,Go-to ring combos?,"What are your go-to ring combos? Which ring is your favorite? [(Here's the ring page of the Wiki for reference.)](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Rings)

I combine the Iridium Band and Slime Charmer in the Forge and that's my default never-take-it-off ring. 

Whenever I start a new save (which I do fairly often; I love the challenge of early game! my goal is to eventually reach perfection on every farm type), I feel so lost not having the magnet and light. I'm always leaving things behind because I expect it to follow me  lol

Most of the time, I'll pair that with a forged Burglar's Ring + Napalm Ring.

But I also have a Vampire Ring + Napalm Ring combo that I'll use for stuff like Qi's Hungry Challenge when I have to worry more about my health stats.

Vampire Ring works especially great with the Slime Charmer because you can target slimes for extra health without worrying about taking damage from them.

The Napalm Ring is my favorite. But it's usually the last one I get since I don't spend much time at Skull Cavern before getting the Obelisk (I hate having to wait for Pam to get to the bus lol). So before getting the Napalm Ring, I'll usually do a Burglar's Ring + Vampire Ring combo.

The Java Ring is also cool but I've only found it on one save so far, and I'm not sure it's worth taking up a ring slot when you can get coffee other ways. But it's funny to imagine the monsters are just casually enjoying their coffee and then we come along and knock them out to steal it lol

I recently found a Lucky Ring and have been wearing it on non-mining days - but I'm not sure how it compares to the Burglar's Ring in that regard. Think I should swap out the Burglar's Ring altogether, or stick with that + a luck boost from food instead?",2,1745761503.0,StardewValley,5,1.0,False

1k949st,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1k949st/explore_the_dumos_countertop_ice_maker_review/,Explore the DUMOS Countertop Ice Maker Review Does It Deliver Rapid Ice Efficiently?,"The DUMOS DU-IM-BK Countertop Ice Maker caught my attention for its compact design and claims of rapid ice production. As someone who entertains frequently and relies heavily on a steady supply of ice, I couldn‚Äôt resist giving this handy appliance a try. Over the weeks of testing it, I‚Äôve explored its features, strengths, and a few areas that I feel could use a touch of improvement. Here‚Äôs the lowdown on my experience with it.

**Design and Compactness**  
This ice maker immediately impressed me with its sleek, minimalistic design. Its carbon black finish matches almost any countertop aesthetic, whether modern or traditional. Measuring just 8.8 x 11.6 x 12.5 inches, it fits snugly on my kitchen counter without hogging space. It even earned a spot in my compact RV kitchen during a weekend getaway, proving how portable and adaptable it is. With its lightweight build and a handle for portability, this little dynamo is ready to move wherever the party is. I was able to lug it around to friends' gatherings without a second thought, and it blended into the environment seamlessly.  

While the size is compact, I noticed the ice basket capacity could be a little larger. If you‚Äôre making ice for a larger group, you might end up emptying the basket into a cooler a bit more frequently than expected.

**Rapid Ice Production ‚Äì A Game-Changer**  
The main selling point of this countertop ice maker is its ability to churn out 9 bullet-shaped ice cubes in just 6 minutes. Honestly, I was skeptical at first, but the results were impressive. The transparent window allows you to spy on the magic happening inside‚Äîand for some reason, it‚Äôs oddly satisfying. There‚Äôs no excuse for running out of ice ever again during a party. With its ability to produce up to 26 pounds of ice in 24 hours, I didn't have to rush to the store for those awkwardly big bags of ice.

[Check DUMOS DU-IM-BK price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0dtpfz89t/)

On the downside, despite the rapid ice-making, I found the cubes to melt slightly faster than I‚Äôd like. If you‚Äôre planning outdoor summer barbecues, having a backup cooler might be wise to keep the cubes frozen for longer.

**Flexibility with Two Ice Cube Sizes**  
This little machine offers two cube size options‚Äîsmall for preserving food or chilling beer, and large for beverages like iced coffee. The variety was surprisingly useful! I used the smaller cubes for chilling shrimp for a dinner party, and the larger cubes turned out to be my go-to for weekend iced lattes. The bullet-shaped design means no sharp edges, which is great if you‚Äôre handing ice to kids or clumsy adults like me. However, I can‚Äôt help but wish there was an even larger size option for those who prefer their cubes to last longer in drinks.

**Self-Cleaning Functionality**  
I'll admit I'm guilty of being lazy when it comes to cleaning appliances, so the self-cleaning function felt like a godsend. All I had to do was hold the power button for five seconds, and the machine took care of the dirty work. This feature came in handy after my RV trip‚Äîit kept things hygienic and low-effort, and that‚Äôs high praise from someone who loves convenience.  

One thing to note, though: while the self-cleaning works well for routine maintenance, you might still need to give it a deeper manual clean occasionally to get stubborn residues out.

**User-Friendly Operation**  
Operating this ice maker is as straightforward as it gets. The control panel was intuitive, and I didn‚Äôt even glance at the manual more than once. Indicator lights conveniently inform you when the water is low or the ice basket is full, saving you from awkward overflows and panic moments. The noise level‚Äîan advertised less than 40dB‚Äîlived up to expectations. The gentle humming sound was barely noticeable, blending effortlessly into the general background noise of my kitchen.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Compact and portable; easy to carry for camping or gatherings.  
- Makes ice in just 6 minutes‚Äîsuper fast.  
- Self-cleaning function eases regular maintenance.  
- Quiet operation suitable for shared spaces or offices.  

**Areas for Concern**  
- Ice melts slightly faster than ideal.  
- Limited basket capacity requires frequent emptying during larger gatherings.  
- Occasionally, deeper manual cleaning might be required despite the self-cleaning feature.  

**Competing Products**  
When sizing it up against competitors like the Euhomy or COSTWAY countertop ice makers, each has its perks. Euhomy offers slightly higher daily ice production but lacks the portability factor that DUMOS brings to the table. COSTWAY has a similar compact design, yet it doesn‚Äôt match the quiet operation of this model. The DUMOS ice maker‚Äôs combination of rapid production, multiple cube sizes, and a self-cleaning function makes it a solid middle ground between these alternatives.

**Price Worthiness**  
This small marvel packs a surprising punch considering its features. While not the cheapest option, its value feels justified given its versatility and added features like self-cleaning and dual ice sizes. If you‚Äôre in need of an appliance that‚Äôs as much at home in your kitchen as it is at an impromptu backyard gathering or RV trip, you‚Äôre likely to feel it‚Äôs worth every penny. However, if you only need ice occasionally, there might be simpler and more budget-friendly options to consider.

1k948j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k948j1/my_last_relationship_broke_me_in_every_other/,My last relationship broke me in every other aspect I can think of.,"Hi, I'm a 21 year old man, and this is how my last relationship took evertything from me and brought me into the mess I am now.

Last December I met a bartender at a place I used to go a lot, I saw her a couple of times and had some small talk before I asked for her Instagram, she agreed to it and gave it to me. Next day I text her and she replies back but soon tells me she's in a middle of a situationship with a guy and she didn't want me to get false hopes, I thanked her for the honesty and stopped talking.

About two weeks later we coincide at a football match, and while I didn't see her, she did see me and texted me to make sure it was me; I wasn't paying attention to my phone so I didn't see it. Since I didn't reply she actually went up to me and greeted me, we had a bit of small talk and then went inside to watch the game. After the game we started texting and she told me she ahd to work after the game and invited me there. I went and had a bit of small talk and left. From that day on we started to talk on a daily basis. We went for a coffee and had a really great ""first date"". We got along pretty well, she talked to me about this situationship and how that guy didn't really set things straight with her, they were hooking up regularly but it seemed he didn't want to make it something serious but she did want. After that date we continue talking and had another coffee. About a week later, I asked her out on a date, we went to the Christmas Market and afterwards got some dinner, at the end of the date I told her how I felt and that I needed to know if things between this guy and her were over before starting anything. She told me it was over and we ended up kissing and started unofficially dating. About mid January I properly asked her to be my girlfriend and started dating officially.

  
This was the first ""serious"" relationship I had since in the past they always ended prematurely and didn't have time to develop. On the other hand she already have had some long lasting relationships so we were a bit uneven but convinced we could make it work. I was a virgin before her, and I let her know I was insecure about it since she already had experience and I was afraid I might not be up to the task. She assured me it was fine and that we would learn together. We did it, the first attempt didn't go well as we were nervous and didn't have any lube so it was a fail, but eventually we did it. On the real first time I wasn't able to climax with sex, maybe because I was nervous or because I have a porn addiction, but I was only able to climax with head. She told me I did good, she climaxed and that it wasn't a bad first time. The second time was fine, we were in a car and I could finish with penetration but I was a bit worried a quickie might not satisfy her, I talked to her about and she said it was fine, that she didn't need to finish every single time and it was a bit hard to achieve it in a car. The third time I wasn't able to finish at all, I thought she did because she told me ""stop a moment, don't move"" just like they finish and are sentitivity is heightened. Since I wasn't able to finish I felt pretty bad and I told her about my addiction, keep in mind this was in March already.

  
The last week before the third time we had sex I wasn't 100%, I had a trip with friends planned and I was worried because I wasn't going to have enough money for the trip. That plus college and working stress, making time for her and other things going on with my friends made me a bit distant, she noticed and told me several times I wasn't the same, eventually I told her I wasn't feeling well, but I assured her it had nothing to do with her. The day before the trip came and that was when we had sex for the third time and I couldn't finish. I went on the trip and was having fun with my friends, we weren't talking much because she worked and when I was out I wasn't checking my phone often. At the same time of the trip, our city was having parties and celebrations, so she told me she was going party with coworkers, I told her to have fun and went to sleep. The next day she told me she got drunk and her parents scolded her for getting home late. She was sad but I figured it was due to the scolding. That night I asked her about her home (because when I was home from the trip I was staying at her place, so I lied to my parents saying the trip was one day longer), she told me that I had to look somewhere to stay, she told me I couldn't stay there. And then it all begun, she didn't said ""I love you too"". We were used to say it every night, but she didn't, I started to freak out and asked her if everything was okay, that's when she break up with me saying maybe we rushed things. This was about 3am and I woke up at 5am to read it. The flight landed home at 1pm and she hadn't had answered my messages, I was freak out. Then she replied, just saying she was sorry and that she didn't know what happened. Then again she stopped replying. At the end I sent her a message saying I was dissapointed and I wanted her to disappear from my life.

Three days after, I reached out to her because I needed answers, I couldn't grasp what have happened and we met. That day she told me I neglected her, that she felt she was begging for love and that she promised herself she wouldn't pass through that again and that was why she was breaking up with me. I asked her to stay, to give me another chance, I always wanted to do things right and it wasn't fair to throw in the towel at the first problem, I told her I was sorry my problems affected our relationship but she was adamant the relationship was over and didn't give me another chance. While talking we were both crying and I was saying that I was sorry, she kept asking me to stop saying ""I'm sorry"" and she also said that future is capricious and maybe in the future we had another chance. I asked her if she really wanted to end the relationship and she said ""My heart says yes, my mind says yes"" and I asked her ""All of you says yes""? and she said ""no"". This gave me hope there was a solution, but that day ended up the same, we were over.

  
After a few days I thinking we could fix it, I texted her best friend to see if he might have an advice on how to get her back but what I got was completely different. He told me that I wasn't guilty of anything, that I should love myself and forget about her, that what she did was wrong, that she was already going after somebody else and that she already forgotten me. That's when I texted her and confront her, she wasn't being truthful, and she confessed, the day she went partying with her coworkers she got drunk and cheated on me, and that's why she didn't give me another chance, because it wouldn't be fair for me since she was the one that failed. That's also why she was asking me to stop apologizing, because she knew it was not my fault. She also told me she began talking again with the guy she used to hook up before I showed up after breaking up with me. That conversation ended with her saying she was sorry for hurting me and me saying I hope she doesn't find another good person because she will hurt them too.

  
Since then we haven't talked, it's been almost a month, she did text one of my friends saying ""take care of him, I know I did bad, he's a good guy he deserves the wolrd and you don't know how much I regret it (regret what? Idk)"". This was already hard because as aforementioned it was my first ""serious"" relationship and it broke within days, I struggle with self-love and setting boundaries, also I attach to quickly so I was grieving and living the best way I could. But today I found out there were more lies. She went to MY friend and told her about our intimacy when I did tell her I dislike that and that I thought intimacy should be private. She told my friend how she expected more and how she preferred to masturbate. Listening to this was overwhelming, I always asked her if I was doing good, I was always trying to take her pleasure into account, and she always told me ""I will tell you when you're not doing fine, because we are here to learn"" so I thought I was doing fine, but I guess she was lying. I have told her how insecure I was due to my inexperience, how could she lie to me? This have showed that she wasn't honest way before the trip, and makes me wonder what else wasn't true, and bringing our sexuality to MY friend was wrong, I asked her to keep our intimacy private. She betrayed the trust, she lied, she cheated.

  
Anyway, this relationship has affected me a lot, made me question my worth, made me insecure about what I was already insecure, question the whole relationship, and honestly I feel my next sexual relationship will have the same issues, because I'm 21 and I have virtually no experience, and apparently the only one I had wasn't as good as I thought.

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! üôå

Ever found yourself in that familiar spiral of overthinking? You know, when you‚Äôre so deep in planning that you forget to actually *do* the thing? ü§î Yep, we‚Äôve all been there. It‚Äôs like being stuck in quicksand; the more you struggle, the deeper you sink. 

So let‚Äôs talk about how to break free with a simple 10-minute fix that I like to call the ""Bias to Action."" Because let's face it‚Äîaction beats analysis every single time!

Here‚Äôs how it works:

### 1. Set a Timer for 10 Minutes ‚è∞
Grab your phone (or a good old-fashioned egg timer) and set it for 10 minutes. This is your window of power, your time to take action without getting paralyzed by every possible outcome.

### 2. Pick ONE Task üìù
Choose one task you‚Äôve been overthinking. It can be anything from tackling that daunting work project to finally organizing your closet that looks like a tornado hit it. 

### 3. Write Down Your Bits of Fear üí≠
Jot down the reasons why you‚Äôre hesitating. What‚Äôs holding you back? Fear of failure? Perfectionism? Procrastination? It‚Äôs all valid, but **name it to tame it.**

### 4. Flip the Script üé≠
Now, for each fear, write down a ‚ÄúWhat if‚Äù that transforms it into something positive. 
- **Fear:** ‚ÄúWhat if I mess it up?‚Äù  
  **Flip it:** ‚ÄúWhat if I learn something new and improve?‚Äù
 
### 5. Take ONE Actionable Step ‚úÖ
This is the ultimate goal. What‚Äôs *one* thing you can do RIGHT NOW that will move the needle, however tiny? It could be sending that email, sketching a rough outline, or even just packing your gym bag. 

### 6. Celebrate (Even If It‚Äôs Small) üéâ
You took action! Give yourself a pat on the back, do a little happy dance, or treat yourself to a coffee. Seriously, celebrate those small wins. They matter!

I know what you‚Äôre thinking: ‚ÄúWhat if it doesn't work out?‚Äù But here's the thing‚Äîwhat if it does? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Think about it: the possibility of progress is always a few steps away. 

Breaking out of that analysis paralysis doesn‚Äôt have to be daunting. Sometimes, it‚Äôs all about pushing yourself to just *start*, no matter how messy it looks.

Chapter 1 Shattered Crown


|| Lilac's POV ||


""Please,"" I whispered, my voice shaking as I turned to Kael. ""Let them go.""


The words felt foreign, bitter, like ashes on my tongue. I had never begged before, never thought I would have to. But for them-for my parents-I would swallow my pride.


I had begged before Kael. I had pleaded with Kael to remember the vows we made, the promises he had whispered in the dark when the world felt safe.


""You will always come first,"" he had told me, his voice a balm to my fears.


That was before Coco. Before she swept into the palace like a storm, leaving ruin in her way. He swore nothing would change, that I would still be his queen, his love. It was all a lie. A beautiful, cruel lie.


Kael's golden eyes flickered with something unreadable, gone before I could grasp it. His silence cut deeper than a blade. My hands clenched into fists, nails digging into my palms, but the pain was nothing compared to the ache inside me.


The air reeked of red fluid and betrayal, thick and suffocating. The grand hall, once a place of celebration, felt like a tomb. The towering marble pillars, carved with our pack's history, seemed to lean inward as if they, too, couldn't bear to witness this. He killed all my trusted warriors, making sure my family was left vulnerable. Flickering torchlight cast jagged shadows across the polished floor ghosts mocking me, whispering of my downfall.


My heart pounded, every beat a painful reminder of how far I had fallen. My knees buckled, and I sank to the cold stone. The impact barely registered. My dress once a symbol of my status as Luna Queen felt heavy, suffocating, meaningless now.


I lifted my gaze, and there he was. Kael. The Alpha King. My husband of five years. The man I had given everything to. His broad shoulders were squared, his jaw set, his golden eyes colder than I had ever seen. This was not the man who once held me close, who swore to protect me. No, this was a stranger wearing his face.


And in his arms, cradled like something precious, was Coco. Wrapped in silk, her raven hair spilling over her shoulders, she was breathtaking. To me, she was nothing but a viper wrapped in silk and secrets. Her lips curled into a smirk triumphant, cruel. She had unraveled my life with nothing more than a glance, watching as everything I built crumbled at her feet.


Behind them, warriors stood motionless, swords drawn, aimed at my parents. My mother and father once proud, unyielding warriors were on their knees, heads howed, Silver chains bound their wrists and ankles, the enchanted metal searing their skin. The sight of them like this-broken, humiliated was a dagger to my heart.


""He is your Beta, Kael. He is the proud of our country,"" I said.


My father, the man who had once stood tall even in the face of war, sagged under the weight of his shame. My mother's fierce eyes were hollow now, empty of hope. The woman who taught me to fight for what I loved was now nothing more than a prisoner in the kingdom she once bled for.


I swallowed hard, forcing down the sob clawing its way up. I couldn't break. Not yet.


""Kael,"" I choked out, my voice cracking. ""If you ever loved me, even a little.... let them go.""


Coco's laughter rang through the silence-sharp, mocking.


""Oh, darling,"" she purred, tilting her head. ""Love has nothing to do with this.""


She stepped forward, slow and deliberate, a predator circling its prey. In her hand, a dagger gleamed under the dim light. She pointed it at me, her smile dripping with false sweetness.


""I'll let them go,"" she mused, ""if you die instead.""


The words hit me like a punch to the gut. Before I could react, her smirk


widened.


""Too late,"" she whispered. ""I changed my mind.""


She hurled the dagger.


Time slowed. The blade spun through the air in a deadly arc.


My father's eyes met mine steady, strong, the way they had always been. But now, they were filled with sorrow. With an apology he would never get to say.


The dagger struck. A sickening thud.


A strangled gasp escaped his lips. His body jerked violently as the silver burned through him. His fingers trembled, reaching-reaching for me-but his strength faltered. He crumpled to the ground. Convulsing. Dying.


""Nol""


The scream tore from my throat, raw and broken.


I lunged for him desperate, frantic


But before I could reach him, before I could touch him one last time, Coco threw another dagger.


This one struck my mother's chest.


A sharp gasp. Her body jolted. Her trembling hands clutched at the hilt, as if she could undo it, as if she could will the blade away. Crimson bloomed across her gown, violent against the pale silk.


Her gaze found mine.


Her fierce, loving eyes the ones that had watched over me my whole life-now filled with something else. Regret. Not for herself. For me. For the pain she couldn't stop.


Her lips parted. No words came. Just a shuddering breath.


She collapsed beside my father.


A hollow, keening sound rose from my chest, a grief so raw it split me apart. My parents my home, my anchor were gone. just like that. Their lives. reduced to bloodstains on cold, unfeeling stone.


The world blurred. My vision darkened as rage and sorrow swallowed me whole. My wolf surged forward, her growl shaking the hall. My claws elongated, my fangs bared. I was ready to tear Coco apart


But Kael stepped in front of her, his massive frame shielding her from my wrath. His golden eyes bore into mine, cold and unyielding, and in that moment, I saw the truth.


I was nothing to him. My love was less than nothing.


The bond we had shared, the love I had believed in, had been an illusion, shattered by the arrival of his true mate,


Chapter 2 Fall Of The Luna


|| Lilac's POV ||


‚ÄúYou witch!‚Äù I snarled, my voice a mixture of pain and fury. My wolf howled within me, her grief echoing my own.


But Kael‚Äôs expression remained impassive, his loyalty firmly with Coco. The woman who had destroyed my life, who had taken everything from me, stood behind him, her smirk a cruel reminder of my powerlessness.


Tears streamed down my face as I looked at the bodies of my parents, their lives extinguished so callously, so cruelly. The girl who had once believed in fairy tales, in happily ever afters, was gone. 


""Tell me, Kael, was she worth slaughtering the entire Royal Beta lineage?"" I yelled.


Kael stood tall, his regal posture unyielding, his golden eyes cold and distant. How did it come to this? How had the man I had helped build an empire become the architect of my ruin?


""Answer me, Alpha King. Or do you still not see red fluid on your hands? Red fluid of your own Beta..."" my voice choaked.


I stared at him, my heart a battlefield of grief and rage. It was me who had stood by his side, it was my family who had fought for him, bled for him, and secured his place on the throne. My parents, proud and unwavering, had led armies against the dark witches on the border, their sacrifices ensuring the peace of our lands. And what had it earned them? Silver chains and a traitor‚Äôs death. What had it earned me? Betrayal. Humiliation. A love turned to ash.


""They fought for you, day and night. My father almost lof his wolf protecting pur kingdom...."" I screamed. But he remained silent as if my words couldn't even get through him.


""They were traitors,"" Kael said finally.


""Traitors? Just because Coco said so? What proof do you have?"" I growled.


""Oh dear. Looks like our Luna has lost her mind,"" Coco taunted instead and he let her.


My mind drifted to the day Coco had arrived at the palace. She had been a fragile thing then, her eyes wide with fear, her hands trembling as she knelt before me. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she had begged, her voice trembling, ‚Äúlet me stay. I have nowhere else to go.‚Äù I had been foolish, so foolish. I had seen her as a lost soul in need of shelter, not the viper she truly was. Kael had taken her in, not as a servant, but as his concubine. 


And now, here I was, kneeling before her. The irony was not lost on me. The woman I had once pitied now stood above me, her delicate features twisted into a mask of triumph. 


""So you still remember that I am the Luna and your queen,"" I growled.


""Are you?"" Coco‚Äôs lips curled into a smirk.


""Was I ever anything to you?"" The question screamed inside me, tearing at my insides like claws. ""Was any of it real?""


Kael‚Äôs gaze flickered, just for a moment, a shadow of something unreadable passing through his golden eyes. Regret? Guilt? I did not know, and I no longer cared. 


A bitter laugh bubbled up in my throat, raw and laced with sorrow.


""Tell me, Kael,"" I whispered, my voice a ghost of what it once was.


""Was it worth it? Was she worth the red fluid? Look around you... look at the red fluid in your hands."" My eyes flickered to Coco, whose smirk only deepened, satisfaction glimmering in her dark eyes.


Kael‚Äôs jaw tightened, but he said nothing. The silence was louder than any answer he could have given me.


Coco stepped closer, her silk dress swishing against the marble floor.


""You should have left when you had the chance,"" she mused, her voice like honey laced with venom. ""But I suppose you were always too stubborn for your own good. Now look at you. Broken. Defeated. Alone.""


Alone. The word echoed in my mind, a cruel mockery of everything I had once had. But she was wrong. I was not broken. Not yet. My heart still beat, my lungs still drew breath, and as long as I lived, so did my vengeance. I would not fall. Not here. Not like this.


Lifting my chin, I met Coco‚Äôs gaze head-on, letting the fury in my eyes burn as brightly as the fire in my soul.


""Enjoy your victory while you can,"" I murmured, my voice steady despite the turmoil within me. ""Because one day, Coco, you will kneel before me. And when that day comes, I will make sure you remember every drop of red fluid you spilled.""


Her smirk faltered for the briefest of moments, a flicker of uncertainty crossing her face before she masked it with a scoff. ""Empty threats from a fallen queen. How pitiful.‚Äù


I couldn‚Äôt hold back any longer. A deep, angry growl tore from my throat as I lunged at Coco, my wolf taking over. My claws slashed through the air, my fangs bared, and for just a second, I saw fear flash in her eyes.


Kael was too stunned to react fast enough. I shoved him hard, my paw slamming into his chest, sending him crashing onto his back. Then Coco was under me‚Äîsmall, fragile, trapped beneath my weight. I glared down at her, my growl echoing through the hall.


This was all her fault. She had created this nightmare. She had twisted Kael‚Äôs mind, shattered my family, taken everything from me.


Then Kael‚Äôs hand locked around my hind leg and yanked. I crashed into the wall, bones cracking as the force knocked me back into human form. I gasped, ribs screaming, my vision swimming as I tried to push myself up.


Across the room, Kael stood over Coco like some kind of knight in shining armor, his eyes blazing with fury.


At me.


I spat red fluid onto the marble floor and laughed‚Äîa raw, broken sound.


""Of course,"" I choked out. ""You‚Äôd always choose her.""


‚ÄúI denounce you as my Luna,‚Äù he declared, his words striking me with the force of a physical blow.


‚ÄúAnd I reject you as my mate. I am severing our bond.‚Äù He turned away from me, his attention focused on Coco as he lifted her from the ground, cradling her protectively in his arms. The tenderness in his touch was a dagger to my heart, a reminder of what I had lost.


‚ÄúWhat should we do with her, Alpha?‚Äù one of the warriors asked, his voice devoid of emotion.


Kael didn‚Äôt even look at me as he replied, his tone as cold as the winter wind. ‚ÄúYou can have your way with her. And once you‚Äôre done, get rid of her.‚Äù


His words shattered what little remained of my soul. I had given him everything‚Äîand this was my reward. Betrayal. Abandonment. Death. The warriors moved toward me, their eyes gleaming with malice, but I was already crawling away, my body trembling with exhaustion and despair.


My hand brushed against something cold and metallic. A dagger, forgotten on the floor. I clutched it tightly, the weight of it grounding me in the moment. My vision blurred with tears as I pressed the blade to my stomach.


‚ÄúMoon Goddess,‚Äù I whispered, my voice breaking.


‚ÄúForgive me. I was not the Luna you expected of me. Forgive me, Mom, Dad. I have failed you too.‚Äù


A single tear rolled down my cheek as I closed my eyes, the dagger poised to end my suffering. If I were to get another chance, I vowed silently, I would never walk this path again. I would never trust so easily, love so blindly. I would rise from the ashes of my shattered life, stronger, fiercer, unbroken.


But as the blade pressed into my skin, a spark of defiance ignited within me. No. I would not give them the satisfaction of my death. Not like this. Not while they still breathed. With a trembling hand, I lowered the dagger, my resolve hardening.


Goddess, was this your justice? I was the Luna Queen and that was the death I deserved! I fell slowly in a cold dark place.


Chapter 3 A Second Chance


|| Lilac's POV ||


The grand hall was a whirl of color and noise‚Äîlaughter, music, and applause bouncing off the marble floors. Golden chandeliers cast a warm glow over everything, making the velvet banners with our pack‚Äôs crest shimmer. Unity. Strength. Words that meant nothing to me now.


My head spun. One second, I‚Äôd been on the throne room floor, a dagger at my stomach, my heart in pieces. The next, I was here‚Äîback in this cursed celebration, the night that had started my ruin.


Then arms wrapped around me. Warm. Familiar. Lavender and honey.


My breath caught.


Mom.


Her embrace was soft, her voice thick with love. ""Congratulations, sweetpea.""


That word‚Äîsweetpea‚Äîhit me like a knife to the chest. I pulled back just enough to see her face, my fingers trembling as they brushed her cheek. Real. Alive. Laugh lines framed her eyes, her smile bright, her golden-flecked irises like sunlight through leaves.


But‚Äîhow? I‚Äôd watched her die. Seen Coco‚Äôs blade take her from me.


Yet here she stood. Unharmed. Or maybe we both were dead! This was the afterlife.


The applause around me swelled, a roaring wave of approval. I turned, pulse racing, and saw him‚Äîmy father. Tall, proud, his silver-streaked hair catching the light. He gave me a nod, the kind that used to make me feel safe.


Both of them. Alive. This couldn‚Äôt be truth. 


My lungs burned. Was this madness? A trick of my dying mind? 


I looked down at myself‚Äîthe shimmering gown, the same one I‚Äôd worn that night. The night Luna Queen Cassandra had named me Kael‚Äôs mate.


A memory? The most terrifying one probably! I piched myself and a gasp left asI felt the pain.


No.


This wasn‚Äôt just any memory. This was... REAL! I came back in time somehow.


Back then, I‚Äôd been naive. I‚Äôd loved Kael for as long as I could remember‚Äîbefore I even had my wolf, before I knew what love really was. I‚Äôd believed being his mate was an honor. That we‚Äôd rule together, that he‚Äôd cherish me.


I‚Äôd been so innocent.


Kael‚Äôs charm had hidden the truth‚Äîthe coldness in him, the cruelty. And I‚Äôd fallen for it, right up until the moment he betrayed me.


But now?


The realization crashed over me‚Äîthis was real. A second chance.


My hands clenched. I wouldn‚Äôt make the same mistakes. I wouldn‚Äôt trust him. I wouldn‚Äôt let Coco destroy everything I loved.


""Lilac, my dear, please step up.""


Luna Queen Cassandra‚Äôs voice cut through the noise. She stood on the stage, regal as ever.


And beside her‚Äî Kael Reventhorn.


Golden-eyed, perfect, the future Alpha King. The crowd adored him. But I saw the truth now‚Äîthe emptiness behind his smile.


The queen extended her hand. ""Today, you take your place as the future Luna of Reventhorns.""


Cheers erupted.


I met Kael‚Äôs gaze. Once, that look would have made my heart race. Now?


Nothing.


Only ice. Only resolve.


‚ÄúForgive me, my queen,‚Äù my mother‚Äôs voice broke through the silence, soft and apologetic. I turned to see her bowing slightly, her hands clasped in front of her.


‚ÄúShe is a bit overwhelmed, it seems.‚Äù Her smile was strained, her eyes darting to me with a mixture of pride and concern. I wanted to tell her the truth, to explain that this was not overwhelming but a deep, seething resistance bubbling beneath the surface. But I couldn‚Äôt. Not here. Not now.


‚ÄúIt is normal indeed,‚Äù Luna Cassandra replied, her voice smooth and reassuring.


‚ÄúLilac is only eighteen, and we are bestowing a great responsibility upon her shoulders.‚Äù Her words were kind, but they did little to ease the turmoil within me.


In my past life, this woman had been a pillar of strength, a figure I had admired and respected. But I knew the truth now. She had done everything for her son, Kael, even when it meant siding with him as he brought Coco into our lives. She had called it normal, a necessary part of life for an Alpha. ‚ÄúMy son is an Alpha and he needs his mate to keep his sanity intact,‚Äù she had said, her voice gentle but firm. ‚ÄúAnd since she is his soulmate, their child will have a stronger bond.‚Äù Her words had cut me deeper than any blade, a betrayal I had never fully recovered from.


‚ÄúGo ahead, dear,‚Äù my mother whispered, her hand squeezing my arm gently.


‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ we are not soul mates,‚Äù I finally managed to say, my voice barely above a whisper. The words hung in the air, a fragile thread of defiance that seemed to silence the entire room. I could feel the tension rise, the unease of the crowd palpable. In my past life, I had accepted this arrangement without question, too naive to see the cracks in the foundation. But now, I couldn‚Äôt let it go unchallenged.


Luna Cassandra‚Äôs smile didn‚Äôt waver, but there was a flicker of something in her eyes, surprise, perhaps, or even a hint of irritation.


‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she said, her tone still warm but with an edge of finality.


‚ÄúBut Kael has reached twenty-three, and you are eighteen. Neither of you has found your mates yet. Above all, finding mates is rare, so we must rely on chosen ones.‚Äù Her words were logical, practical, but they did nothing to ease the storm raging within me.


‚ÄúWhat if one of us finds our mate?‚Äù I asked, my voice trembling but firm. The crowd fell silent, the weight of my question settling over them like a heavy fog.


Before Luna Cassandra could respond, Kael stepped forward, his presence commanding and undeniable. His golden eyes locked onto mine, filled with a warmth that felt so genuine it made my stomach churn.


‚ÄúI will still love you and cherish you,‚Äù he said, his voice strong and unwavering. It echoed through the hall, a vow meant to reassure not just me but the entire crowd. ‚ÄúOnly you will be my Luna. I vow to the Moon Goddess that you will be the only one for me.‚Äù


His words were beautiful, poetic even, but they rang hollow in my ears. I knew this was a performance, a carefully crafted show meant to win the favor of the nobles and secure his place as the future Alpha King.


‚ÄúI will always cherish you,‚Äù he said, his voice soft but carrying the weight of a promise. ‚ÄúFrom today onwards, you will be my precious Princess.‚Äù


The crowd erupted into applause, their cheers and whistles filling the air. But to me, it felt like a funeral march, the sound of my freedom being buried beneath the weight of duty and expectation.


Chapter 4 A Spark In Shadow


|| Lilac‚Äôs POV ||


""May I?"" Kael asked, extending his hand. I forced a smile.


The crowd cheered as Kael led me to the dance floor. His grip on my hand was tight, like he already owned me. The music was soft, but I felt nothing but anger.


I hated this. I hated his fake smile, his hand on my waist, his pretend love. Every step felt like I was betraying myself.


How did I end up here again? I had a second chance to change things, but here I was, dancing with the man who ruined me. Memories of my past life came rushing back‚Äî Kael‚Äôs betrayal, his cold words as he left me to die.


‚ÄúYou dance well,‚Äù Kael whispered, his breath hot on my ear. I shivered, disgusted.


‚ÄúPractice makes everything perfect,"" I said, keeping my voice steady. In my past life, I‚Äôd learned to pretend to enjoy your company.


The music dragged on, each note a reminder of what I‚Äôd lost. When it ended, I walked away, leaving the cheers behind.


In my past life, I‚Äôd been naive. That version of me died betrayed and broken. This time, I'ld be stronger. But how could I, a beta with no power, stand against the future Alpha King?


I wandered into the garden, away from all the eyes. My mind racing. It was peaceful here than in the hall. Exhausted, I stumbled, but someone caught me. The scent of pine filled the air.  I looked up, my breath catching in my throat as my eyes met his. A pair of piercing grey, like storm clouds gathering on the horizon, filled with a quiet intensity that made my heart skip a beat. His face was sharp, his features carved with a rugged handsomeness that was both intimidating and captivating. This was Alaric. The forgotten piece of this kingdom.


I had heard the rumors, of course. Everyone had. They whispered through the halls like a ghostly echo, growing darker with each retelling.


Alaric‚Äôs mother had been the first mate of Alpha King Darius. She had been beloved by the pack, a Luna that inspired devotion and awe. But her life had been cut short in a tragedy no one dared to speak of openly. Some said illness had claimed her, others believed treachery had been involved, though no one ever pointed fingers. Not publicly, at least.


Her death had left a void in the castle, one that Darius had filled almost too quickly. Cassandra, the woman who would become the new Luna, had stepped into the role without hesitation, her delicate hands gripping the crown that once belonged to another. And just like that, Alaric had been cast aside, his presence fading into the shadows while Kael flourished under Cassandra‚Äôs reign.


They never called him a prince. He was the firstborn son of the Alpha King, yet his name was never spoken with reverence or admiration. Instead, it was whispered in hushed, fearful tones, a cautionary tale for those who dared to question the natural order.


""His soul is cursed,"" they said.


""His mate will die before she ever gets the chance to love him.""


He was nothing like Kael, no golden child, no rising Alpha. Where Kael was fire, burning bright and dazzling in his brilliance, Alaric was ice. A cold, creeping force, slipping through the cracks of the castle‚Äôs walls, lurking in places no one dared to look.


""Stay away from the king‚Äôs firstborn,"" the castle maids had warned in whispers, their hands clutching their aprons as if warding off some unseen force.


""His touch brings only death.""


And yet, as I stood there, his hands still gripping my arms, I felt no fear. Only a strange, electric warmth that spread through me, igniting something deep within my chest. His touch was firm but gentle, his presence both calming and exhilarating. I couldn‚Äôt look away from his eyes, those stormy grey eyes that seemed to see straight through me, past the fa√ßade I had built, past the pain and the anger, to the core of who I was.


A spark ran through my skin where he touched me, a sensation so intense it left me breathless. I had never felt anything like it before, not with Kael, not with anyone. It was as if the world had shifted, as if the very air around us had changed. What was this feeling? This strange, overwhelming connection that seemed to pull me toward him, as if some unseen force had tied us together?


For a moment, neither of us moved. The garden was silent, the world around us fading away until it was just the two of us, standing there in the moonlight. My heart raced, my mind struggling to make sense of what I was feeling. But one thing was clear: this was different. This was real.


And it terrified me.


The garden was peaceful. Or it would have been‚Äîif not for the voice cutting through the night.


‚ÄúI wonder what my sister-in-law is doing out here all alone.‚Äù


I stopped. My pulse kicked up, but I turned slowly. Alaric leaned against a tree, half in the shadows, smirking like he owned the place. His grip was still there on my arms as he pulled me a bit closer. Moonlight caught in his gray eyes, sharp and unreadable.


I pulled my hands free from his grip, hating the way my skin still tingled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your sister-in-law.‚Äù


He chuckled. ‚ÄúNo?‚Äù


He stepped closer. I didn‚Äôt move. He was way too taller than me, too close, too pompus.


‚ÄúI could‚Äôve sworn I saw you in my brother‚Äôs arms tonight, dancing in joy,‚Äù His tone was light, but there was something else under it.


‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a choice,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúQueen Cassandra decided that for me.‚Äù


He tilted his head. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre just a victim? No fight left in you? Oh, helpless Lilac.‚Äù


Anger flared hot. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not helpless.‚Äù


His smirk widened. ‚ÄúOf course not.‚Äù His voice dropped lower, almost amused.


I stepped back, my shoulders hitting the rough bark of a tree. He moved in, filling the space between us, bringing the scent of pine and leather with him.


‚ÄúRegretting your decision already?‚Äù His breath was warm against my cheek.


I forced a steady voice. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt regret anything.‚Äù


His eyes flickered. ‚ÄúLiar.‚Äù


He reached up, brushing a stray lock of hair from my face. My breath hitched. Too close. My eyes fell on his full lips and suddenly all I wanted to do was kissing him, running my hands in his soft dark hair.


""What are you thinking so deeply about, sister-in-law?"" He said and I saw a dangerous smike over his lips.


Focus Lilac! He was one of the Reventhorns. STAY AWAY FROM THEM AND YOU MIGHT LIVE LONGER! I yelled in my head.


""None of your business,"" I replied.


I ducked under his arm and put distance between us, my steps quick. I could feel his gaze on my back, but I didn‚Äôt turn around.


The path stretched ahead, bathed in silver light. I needed to think. To get out of this mess. There had to be a way.


But first, I had to deal with this engagement.


And I had a feeling that wasn‚Äôt going to be easy.


Chapter 5 Plan In Motion


|| Lilac‚Äôs POV ||


The morning sun lit up my room as I woke up, the shadows of a restless night still lingering. My first thought was to reach out to Runa, my wolf. But there was no response. My heart raced as I tried again, but still nothing. She was barely there. Something was wrong. Why had I been given this second chance? It didn‚Äôt make sense.


The smell of pancakes pulled me back to the present. Downstairs, I could hear the soft hum of conversation and the clinking of plates. It felt like home, like the life I‚Äôd fought so hard to protect.


I dressed carefully‚Äîa blouse, a pencil skirt, and heels. As I walked downstairs, the smell of pancakes and coffee grew stronger. My family was in the kitchen. Mom was at the stove, flipping pancakes. Dad sat at the table with his coffee, and Ezra, my younger brother, was reading a book. He looked so much like Dad, with the same dark hair and sharp features. Everything felt normal, and I wanted to keep it that way.


‚ÄúGood morning, sweetpea,‚Äù Dad said, smiling at me.


‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù I replied, sitting down.


Mom set a plate of pancakes in front of me.


‚ÄúYou look different,‚Äù she said, studying me.


I glanced down. I *was* different. The naive girl who believed in fairy tales was gone. Now, I carried the weight of a second chance.


‚ÄúI have some plans,‚Äù I said vaguely, picking up my fork.


Mom didn‚Äôt press, but her gaze lingered. Breakfast was peaceful, filled with casual chatter and the sound of forks on plates. But I couldn‚Äôt stay. I had work to do.


As I cleared the table, Ezra leaned against the doorframe. ‚ÄúWhere are you off to so early?‚Äù he asked, still in his pajamas.


‚ÄúJust some errands,‚Äù I said, waving a hand vaguely over my shoulder.


Ezra‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúErrands,‚Äù he repeated, his voice dripping with skepticism. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a suspiciously vague answer.‚Äù


I sighed, adjusting the strap of my bag. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs not that interesting.‚Äù


‚ÄúThat‚Äôs debatable,‚Äù he countered, pushing off the doorframe and stepping closer. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dressed like you‚Äôre about to go negotiate a business deal or break someone‚Äôs heart. Or both.‚Äù


I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúWow. What a range.‚Äù


He smirked. ‚ÄúI call it like I see it.‚Äù Then, his expression turned teasing. ‚ÄúWait, are you going on a date! Is this with Kael? ‚Äù


I scoffed. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not.‚Äù


He gasped dramatically, clutching his chest. ‚ÄúOh my God. Are you already cheating on him?‚Äù


I shoved him lightly, but he barely budged. ‚ÄúIt is not a date outfit, Ezra.‚Äù


‚ÄúThen why are you blushing?‚Äù he shot back, grinning like he‚Äôd won something.


‚ÄúI‚Äôm not, ‚Äù I cut myself off, realizing the more I denied it, the worse it would look. I exhaled sharply, pinching the bridge of my nose. ‚ÄúYou are so annoying.‚Äù


He grinned wider. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my job as your older brother.‚Äù


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre younger by a whole year.‚Äù I groaned. But inside my heart, it felt right. I missed his teasing.


‚ÄúAnd yet, infinitely wiser,‚Äù he grinned.


I shook my head, but despite my best efforts, a small smile tugged at my lips. This was Ezra,  relentless, obnoxious, and somehow, always able to make me laugh even when I didn‚Äôt want to.


The drive to the plaza was quiet, the hum of the engine the only sound accompanying my thoughts. Today was the day. Kael would be holding a conference here, a gathering of alphas and nobles to discuss pack alliances and future plans. It was the perfect opportunity, a chance to set my plan in motion.


I parked the car and stepped out, the cool morning air brushing against my skin as I made my way to the podium. The plaza was already bustling with activity, the press setting up their cameras and reporters milling about. My eyes scanned the crowd, and it didn‚Äôt take long to spot her.


‚ÄúLilac!‚Äù Elara‚Äôs voice rang out, bright and excited, as she hurried toward me. My best friend since childhood, she was a whirlwind of energy, her curly hair bouncing with every step. She pulled me into a tight hug, her enthusiasm infectious. She was from a Gamna family and was interested in news reporting and not to mention spying on all hot boys since our middle school.


‚ÄúHi, Elara,‚Äù I said, laughing softly as I returned her embrace. ‚ÄúI thought I would find you here.‚Äù


‚ÄúOf course, I‚Äôm here!‚Äù she exclaimed, pulling back to show me her press badge with a grin. ‚ÄúI heard you were chosen as the future Alpha King‚Äôs mate! Can you believe it? My best friend, the future Luna! This is huge, Lilac! Your dream come true moment!!!!‚Äù


I forced a smile, my stomach twisting at her excitement. ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ something,‚Äù I said, my voice carefully neutral.


Elara tilted her head, her brow furrowing slightly as she studied me. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt sound thrilled. Isn‚Äôt this what you‚Äôve always wanted?‚Äù


I hesitated, my mind racing. How could I explain to her that the life she thought I wanted was the very thing I was trying to escape? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated,‚Äù I said finally, shaking my head. ‚ÄúBut listen, I need your help.‚Äù


Her eyes lit up, curiosity replacing her earlier concern. ‚ÄúOf course! What do you need?‚Äù


I glanced around, making sure no one was within earshot before getting closer. ‚ÄúI need you to get me access to the press room. There‚Äôs something I have to do, and I can‚Äôt do it alone.‚Äù


Elara‚Äôs grin widened, her excitement undimmed. ‚ÄúConsider it done. But you owe me the full story later, okay?‚Äù


‚ÄúDeal,‚Äù I said, relief flooding through me as she linked her arm with mine and led me toward the press room.


As we walked, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a flicker of hope. This was it. The first step in changing my fate. And with Elara by my side, I knew I could do it. Whatever it took, I would protect my family. I would rewrite my story.


And maybe, just maybe, I would find a way to be free.


Chapter 6 Miracle Pill


|| Lilac‚Äôs POV ||


The press room was chaos‚Äîreporters rushing, keyboards clacking, and the smell of coffee and ink filling the air. I moved through it like a shadow, my heart racing. There was no time to hesitate. My mission was clear: plant a document that would cast doubt on Kael‚Äôs new ‚Äúmiracle pills.‚Äù If I could spark enough suspicion, it might buy me time to gather real proof before it was too late.


I spotted a messy table near the wall, papers scattered everywhere. Perfect. No one would notice one more sheet. I flipped through the pile, pretending to search for something, and slipped my document in. It was subtle‚Äîjust a few lines questioning the safety of the pills. A small spark, but enough to start a fire.


As I stepped back, my fingers tingled. Every nerve screamed at me to leave before someone noticed. I forced myself to walk calmly, blending in with the frantic energy of the room. But with each step, doubt crept in. Was this the right thing to do? Was I any better than Kael if I used deception?


Then I thought of Ezra. My brother, banished and broken because of Kael‚Äôs lies. I had failed him once. I wouldn‚Äôt let it happen again. This time, I would fight.


I slipped into the auditorium just as the conference began. The room was packed, everyone focused on Kael as he took the stage. He looked every bit the confident Alpha King‚Äîsharp suit, golden eyes, and a voice that commanded attention. He introduced the Miracle Pill, claiming it would make warriors unstoppable. The crowd erupted in applause, but I clenched my fists, remembering the truth. Those pills came at a cost‚Äîaddiction, destruction, and Ezra‚Äôs ruin.


I scanned the room and saw Alaric near the front. His grey eyes met mine, and for a moment, it felt like he could see right through me. I looked away, my cheeks burning.


When the presentation ended, the crowd buzzed with excitement. I stayed in my seat, planning my next move. Then Alaric appeared beside me, his smirk as annoying as ever. ‚ÄúImpressive, isn‚Äôt he?‚Äù he said, his tone dripping with sarcasm.


I forced a smile. ‚ÄúHe knows how to work a crowd.‚Äù


Alaric‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúAnd what about you, Dove? What are you up to?‚Äù


Before I could answer, Kael called my name. He was walking toward me, his golden eyes fixed on mine. ‚ÄúLilac,‚Äù he said, his voice warm but with an edge. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking for you.‚Äù


I stood, my heart pounding. ‚ÄúCongratulations on the presentation,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice steady.


Kael smiled, but his eyes were sharp. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù He glanced at Alaric. ‚ÄúBrother. Didn‚Äôt expect to see you here.‚Äù


Alaric smirked. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt miss it.‚Äù


The tension between them was thick. I glanced between them, unsure how to defuse it.


Kael turned back to me. ‚ÄúLilac, join me for a meeting with the nobles. Your insight would be valuable.‚Äù


I hesitated. This was a test. Kael was testing my loyalty. I couldn‚Äôt refuse without raising suspicion.


‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I said, forcing a smile.


As I followed Kael, I glanced back at Alaric. His grey eyes held mine, and for a moment, I felt a flicker of hope. He was watching me, a silent reminder that I wasn‚Äôt alone.


Whatever came next, I wouldn‚Äôt let Kael win. Not this time.


-------


The meeting room was quiet, a sharp contrast to the noisy auditorium outside. The dark wood walls and flickering chandelier light gave the space a heavy, serious feel. The smell of expensive cologne and coffee filled the air, adding to the tension.


I stood beside Kael at the head of the table, playing my part as the loyal future Luna. The nobles and alphas around us watched him with admiration and greed. The Miracle Pill wasn‚Äôt just a product‚Äîit was a symbol of Kael‚Äôs power and vision. Everyone wanted a piece of it.


But beneath my calm exterior, my heart raced. The document I‚Äôd planted in the press room had done its job. Now, I had to wait and see if the seeds of doubt would grow.


The meeting started smoothly. Papers were passed around, and the nobles nodded as they reviewed the numbers. Pens clicked, ready to sign. I kept my hands clasped, nails digging into my palms under the table.


Then, a voice cut through the room.


‚ÄúThis is incredible work, but I can‚Äôt approve it.‚Äù


All eyes turned to Alpha Asher. He was one of the strongest alphas, known for his integrity. His words carried weight.


‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù another alpha asked, confused. ‚ÄúThis is a great opportunity.‚Äù


Asher leaned forward, his blue eyes sharp. ‚ÄúThe pill was only tested on two rogues, and they both died. A pill this powerful comes with a price.‚Äù He paused, his gaze locking onto Kael. ‚ÄúAnd I found traces of wolfsbane in it.‚Äù


The room went silent. Wolfsbane, even in small amounts, was dangerous for werewolves. It weakened them over time, corroding their strength and bond with their wolf.


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs reckless,‚Äù Asher continued. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt risk my people with this.‚Äù


The silence grew heavier. Cameras clicked, capturing every tense moment. The media, here for promotion, now had a scandal.


Murmurs turned to whispers, then accusations.


‚ÄúIs this true?‚Äù one alpha demanded.


‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you mention this, Kael?‚Äù another noble asked, his tone sharp.


Kael‚Äôs jaw tightened, but he forced a smile. I could see the crack in his calm facade.


I looked down at the document in my hands, my heart pounding. This was my moment. I let my fingers tremble slightly, as if I were just realizing the truth. I took a shaky breath and looked up at Kael, my eyes wide with feigned shock.


‚ÄúKael,‚Äù I said softly, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all here‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs wolfsbane in the ingredients.‚Äù


The room erupted. Voices rose, questions flying like daggers.


‚ÄúIs this true?‚Äù


‚ÄúWolfsbane? How could this happen?‚Äù


‚ÄúYou said it was safe, Kael!‚Äù


Chaos filled the room, and I stayed quiet, watching as Kael‚Äôs carefully built image began to crumble.",1,1745761147.0,novelsfree,1,1.0,False
1k945wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1k945wj/aita_for_leaving_and_telling_my_whole_family_id/,AITA For leaving and telling my whole family id be back after 3 months only to leave them behind for my LRD Relationship?,"Alright, context becuase we are going to need a lot of it. I was 19 when I moved out of the United States, born and raised by my single mother, with my sister. 
So when I was growing up I always noticed there was a bit of a favoritism towards my sister, it didn't really bother me until I turned 16. My mother was really trying to force me into a job, as soon as she could so I could start paying for bills and things. At this point my mom's Alcohol addiction started getting really bad, and she wasn't able to support buying it on top of the cat food (for our 7 cats at the time) and her cigarettes, and her weed, and was really trying to push these expenses onto me. Now the reason she was not pushing my sister (18 at the time) into work is because she really wanted to get social security benefits from the government, because yeah my mom actually didn't pay the bills herself she had SSI paying somehow, don't ask me she manulipated the system to believe she can't work. When in fact she is perfectly capable. (I won't go into it any further as I've already tried to get her in trouble for it, telling adults I met about it and people I thought I could trust only getting met with ""your just a teen trying to make your mom sound bad"" or ""you shouldn't talk about your mother that way"" responses, otherwise no one would believe me. So she's continued to get away with not having to pay a single bill herself basically my whole life how I understood it. I didn't live with her either, she lost custody of us off and on with my great grandmother, which is a completely different story. 
So anyways, she was basically nice to my sister because she only wants to get more money out of her. As for me I'm not really that worthy in her eyes, from the start I was always told as a little girl she wished she would have had an abortion with me, and never had me becuase two kids is too much to handle and things like that, so I always felt a little uncomfortable and sad around my mom. As I got older I started to feel that pressure more, as I was forced to do all the chores, like feeding the cats, their litter, sweeping the floors of litter, vacuuming the cat hair, and the counters cleaning the windows (DAILY) which is just insanity. Yes I was basically Cinderella in my own home, which sounds dramatic but that's just how it was. 
So not only was my mom mentally abusive, as she would yell at me if any of these chores weren't done, or done to her standard shed yell at me and scream and take my things and throw them out and say if I didn't do it right next time it's my ps2. And ofc that's my life, my escape so I didn't ever want her to take it from me. I of course fought back a lot, and yelled but that's my mom there's not much more I can do. 
My sister, if your wondering (a WEEB) which has no real revilence tbh but it's just funny to mention, would sit most times watching anime without a care in the world with whatever was happening between me and mom, and said sometimes I simply need to stop making mom so angry then we wouldn't have issues. Failing to see the real point. 
Anyways futher down the line, she started hitting me on the head really hard while I was asleep, at 2am most nights when she'd come home drunk off her ass and scream about hair being on the floor in the bathroom or the litter being full. 
I wasn't allowed to shut the bathroom door while going to the bathroom or taking baths, I wasn't allowed to shut my bedroom door for any reason at all otherwise she'd slam it open and interrogate me on why it's closed. I was never allowed to be alone, or go outside of the house. Which was a small duplex, and I felt really cramped as it only had two rooms and me and my sis shared the one I mostly stayed in. 
I didn't feel at home a lot, and I could have gone to live with my great grandma but like I said, it's really it's own story in itself and this one's already going to be so long  as there's so much to tell.
I was starting to feel a bit like what's the point anymore, and I wasn't really finding any fun in the games I was playing (as my mom didn't let me buy new ones, I only played Sly Cooper, Jack and Daxter, and Ratchet and clank size matters, Neopets The Darkest Faerie and spyro 2, and 3 over and over again because they were left there by her previous X boyfriend) that's also how the ps2 was in her house. 
Once she started treating those I thought it's only a matter of time, until I loose my ps2 and then what can I do. My sis hogs the TV for anime all the time, and I stopped drawing all together and painting because I lost that fun feeling from it I guess. I started getting on edge and every day felt like another nightmare, and one day my mom pulled a knife on me. She's done so 4 times after that, and I have really lost a lot of connection with her from it, if your wondering she'd chase me slowly but enough to scare me and I would always run out and scream while running down the street, those where really the only times I could go outside expect while being supervised by her occasionally. (another story as well) 
I started planning how I would do it, end myself I mean. And I did the most cringe thing ever I went to Twitter and said some dark things about how I feel, and my life and how I'm going to finally end my own suffering, all the ways I felt and how awful my life was and how much I was hurt by my mother and sister. 
That's when a random follower of mine, let's call him... Wolf? Started talking to me, he Dm'd me something really sweet like ""I read your post and I'm really sorry your feeling that way, if you ever need someone to talk to I'm always here"" I at the time didn't really want to open my heart to anyone I wanted to push everything and everyone away, I didn't feel like life mattered anymore. So when I read it, I ignored it at first, but the next day I thought about it more (as they were the only person that reached out) and thought. Do I really want to leave this person wondering forever, if I do, do it? 
So I messaged a simple ""thanks"" and went about my day, he messaged something like ""how are you today?"" And I said I'm fine. I kept the conversation short becuase I didn't think it mattered, I knew this person was probably just trying to make me feel better just because they saw my post, and they don't know truly what's going on, and they probably just think I'm seeking some kind of validation to live or something. So I just kinda stopped responding. But he just kept messaging every day even if I didn't respond, ""hey! Hope your okay!"" And things like ""I know your probably mad I keep messaging but I just wanted to say I hope your doing alright!"" And stuff at one point and I ended up saying something like ""thanks"" plainly again, I started to feel bad at this point becuase I was like dang this person seems to kinda care about me. What? So I asked Wolf if he could just stop messaging me anymore, and to forget about my post (as I took it down in fear more people would message like this) and that I'm okay, and to stop worrying. And he then said ""I see you play RDR2, you posted something about it a while ago, I could buy the game and join you since I saw you said you didn't have anyone to play with"" I was so shocked, like what? Is this guy stalking me or something wtf, and I then stalked his page and saw that he was a conservative person or something I think they call it (and at this point I had a job and bought a ps4 myself by hiding money from my mom which again is another story) 
So I finally saved enough for the game myself and bought that too, she wasn't happy but she said I owed her my next two paychecks in full for that, and I didn't really care at that point I just wanted to try the game it looked amazing. Anywho, so I said I would really like that thanks, and I didn't believe he would buy it or anything but he added me on the PS4 as a friend (my user used to be in my bio) and he said the game has to download and it'll take forever but he'll message me when it's done, so I was like okay. Fine, sure this is what I wanted someone to play with after all, why not. We ended up talking over the game and he was very quiet and I was too, but he started asking about my mom, because I never played any games where you could talk to people before and she was asking me who I'm talking to and why, and if it was the FBI? Because she's absolutely nuts ANOTHER STORY. I'm sorry üò≠- 
And I said a friend I met online, and she right away cut off my power and started yelling and forcing me to do chores I had already done, and I was thinking wtf is wrong with her like actually? So I texted him what happened and he said why is your mom like that, it doesn't make sense. Then I just had to tell him. And he couldn't believe a word. Then about a year and a half later, over minecraft and sneakily playing and talking to him. He asked if I could be his gf, and I never even thought of being in a relationship before so I was like.... um? How I don't even know where you live or who you are, and your just a voice in my tv. And he was like it's a LDR we can still play and talk like normal we are just saved for each other or something like that. And I was like? Okay I guess if we are still friends that's all that matters. But then I started getting crush on him and understood what this LDR was gonna be, and it was okay actually. So we started sneaking on my mom's phone BECAUSE OH YEAH I FORGOT I had to use my MOMS phone until I was 18 to do anything and everything. And I already had insta on my mom's phone so we would talk when my mom went to smoke weed with friends or buy alcohol. I told him how she was and my life and everything and most of the time I never got to really say everything becuase it was so much and so long.
So after hearing it he couldn't believe it but I had to prove it so many times I'd go onto video chat and he'd mute so I could bait my mom into admitting things to me like how she treats me and the stupid rules and I also showed him the crazy stuff like, apparently the hair in the bathroom floor is only my hair, although my mom has long brown hair, my sister and me, but my mom would say it's only MY HAIR and we even own 7 CATS WHY IS MY HAIR THE HAIR YOUR WORRIED ABOUT????? Idk ugh things like that would just drive me crazy.
So anyways, one time we made a plan to take the lock from the outside of my room, to the inside I had to unscrew the hinges of the thing and make the knob with the lock face the inside and the normal side outside. So I could lock myself away from my mom instead of her locking me in. She came home drunk and went of course stomping for my room, but this time I wasn't sleeping I stayed up with the phone (at this time I had my own phone *18*) and she came right for the door and when she realized it was locked from the inside she went batshit crazy. She kicked on the door yelling at the top of her lungs my name, and then like an idiot I realized I forgot the screw drivers. I placed them back where they go like an idiot and she went right for them, so I hurried and sat against the door and listened to her rant on about me and how she was gonna kill me once she gets in. And I had to really push against the door when she did get them unhinged and Wolf keept pleading for me to call the police on her, or he would himself. Many times he'd say that and I said I can't she's my mom, I don't want her to go to jail. Sure I want her to know how I'm suffering and how delusional she is, but without her I don't have a home or my stuff and she'd continue to hate me forever. 
Anywho, a year or so later (now 3 years into our LDR) we planned the escape. I had been saving a lot of my money to the side as mom got clean for a month or two which was great! But she was still stupid and had crazy rules. Just less intense without the influence. 
So I was able to save a bit more. I got around $5,000 after 9 months of collecting. And started mentioning how I was going to meet my friend that lives outside of the USA. She was not having it at all, and said no all the time and that I'm crazy and to STFU before she breaks my phone. And told me over and over this is why I didn't want you having a phone, your gonna find some way to make friends and do stupid shit like this to me. I kept trying to slightly push her to say it's okay, and that I'd only be gone for 3 months what's the worst that could happen?... she was not having it, and said many times, you can't even afford that, you don't have a passport. It's not happening. But me and Wolf knew the only problem was the passport she was right. So he found a building on Google maps that was around 10 mins away from where we lived that I could get a passport, so I needed a good lie to go and get one done. I first told her o needed it for my online class, (I was home schooled from 7th grade until graduation) not allowed to go to prom our my grad thanks mom! 
She didn't believe it. Of course it was stupid so I thought, well I need it becuase I'm 18 now and I should have a better form of ID. Maybe it could help in the future. She thought of that as a kinda good idea, so we went with that. Wolf told me what to ask for, not a domestic card but the book, costed more but worth it. When I paid, my mom got so angry she asked where I had that money hiding and said things on the way home like wheres your stash? I knew you were hiding money from me. That day we got home she tore my room apart, and only found the $300 that got lost under my mattress, (where I had it hiding) but I had anticipated her wondering where the money came from and took what I thought was all of it from out beneath my mattress and shoved it into a old school binder and put it in my shelf. She never found the $5,000. Thank God. 
Phase 2 of me and wolf's plan, buy the tickets. Now I was rather sheltered from the world so I didn't know how planes really worked or airports and everything I was starting to get a lot of anxiety and really scared. I hated the idea of planes but if it meant getting away from her then anything was worth it. 
If your wondering I was 19 at this point and Wolf was 21, he's almost 2 years older than me. So no I wasn't groomed or anything.
Anyways, he bought the tickets online through an app which I didn't really trust but he made sure it was one way and from my home town to Iceland, and then I'd have a 5hr layover until my next stop, I'll keep that private as I don't really want to doxx myself. 
So I was in terror, I gave this guy my bank card and he bought a ticket for $987 I think it was, with luggage included and two carry ons somehow. And I was afraid of how to break the ice to my mom. At first I thought I'd tell her I need to be taken to the airport to meet with someone and she should just go home, no that'd never work. So I thought some other stupid ideas, that also would never work. So I decided I would then just admit I'm going to try and visit that one guy I've been talking to for a few years now. And meet him irl, and come back after 3 months. She said no again, and that's when I broke the news I had already bought the ticket. She said she's not taking me and my money is going to be waisted and started yelling and getting crazy again and my sister didn't believe it either until we went into the room and talked about it. She said there's no way your moving out, I said I am. She's like no. Your not. I said (because obviously she's being like my mom, if she can't accept it I'll tell her I'm only visiting too) so I said it'll only be for 3 months anyways so I'll come back. She seemed more okay with that, and then helped me Gass mom up. Thank God. 
So somehow we got mom to drive us to the airport and I said my goodbyes to them and they were crying for the first time over me. Which still hurts to see, because I felt like they didn't even care about me.
But it was too late, and I needed to go. I knew how they were behind closed doors and if i stayed any longer I'd go crazy. 
So I did it, to be honest I was lost most of the time but I relied on this pair of old ladies that were nice to me when I was waiting to board the plane, I was stupid and told them everything and they called me an Adventure to which I thought was funny and kinda cool idk? üòÇ
So when we got off at Iceland I asked them what do we do? And they said it's time to get your luggage unless it's going onto a next flight, and otherwise since your catching your next flight I think you'll have to go and get your luggage rechecked in. So I asked a woman who worked there where the luggage was and stuff and got lost and then followed a crowd and eventually found my way, at first I was stressed but I had a 5hr layover so I thought it's fine if I just roam for a bit. I started to get really shakey though tbh, like bad gitters and wondering if I'll be murdered or not because yk. People that go out of the USA to meet a stranger don't always come back alive. So I was starting to get a little fearful but I decided to call Wolf, and talk to him the whole layover (it was AM hours for him and he still woke up to be there for me) 
I was so excited to get on the next flight, and see him and he was too. When I finally did he waved an American flag in the window of the airport, and I saw him as I stepped out onto the stairs of the plane. I was so scared, excited, nervous and afraid. But then I went to hunt for my luggage and found it and came running out. He was there and we hugged until he squeezed me so tight I needed to take my inhaler lol. We had that moment of like, holy crap your right in front of me and like oml it was crazy.
So we went to drive home in his sister's car and everything was amazing. And has been for the last 5 years of our relationship, I'm engaged now and 23, and life has just been flying and if your wondering yes I'm completely happy. I just have a little hole in my heart from mom and sis, whenever we talk over Facebook they are always asking me when I'll be back and why I left them, and that I ruined my sisters life. And honestly I don't even know what to say to them most of the time. It feels bad but, I also just feel happy again. I started drawing again, and singing a bit, and learning his language, his family is a whole OTHER story again üòÖ
But yeah! AITA? Becuase sometimes when we talk all my mom does is cry and it makes me feel bad but like, she was crazy I had to escape. Sometimes I think about what my life would have been if I was still stuck there...

(BTW plzzzz somebody lmk if this actually gets read, my life is crazy and like so much has happened but I honestly just try to cope and get by with coffee and relaxing to music all the time, and I recently got into watching Charlotte's YT channel becuase I love the tea and she's so funny, I wish I had a friend like her growing up!

We've been living together for about 8 months and it was fine at first but lately it's been a NIGHTMARE.

J works from home and I work at an office. The problem? She's turned our entire living room into her ""workspace."" I'm talking multiple monitors, keyboards, random equipment, papers EVERYWHERE. There's literally nowhere to sit anymore except for like half the couch.

I've tried to be understanding because everyone needs space to work, but this is getting ridiculous. Our apartment isn't huge, and I'm paying HALF the rent for a space I can barely use anymore.

Last week, I finally had enough when I came home and found she'd moved our coffee table into her bedroom to use as an ""extension desk."" I asked her to please keep her work stuff contained and return the coffee table. She said she needed the space and I was being unreasonable since I'm ""never home during work hours anyway.""

Yesterday, I snapped. While she was out getting groceries, I moved all her work stuff to one corner of the living room, put the coffee table back, and rearranged things so there was actually space to exist. I didn't damage anything, just organized it better.

When she got home she FREAKED OUT. She said I messed up her ""system"" and that I had no right to touch her things. She's now threatening to break the lease unless I ""fix it"" and let her have the living room.

My friends are split - some say I shouldn't have touched her stuff without permission, others say she's being ridiculous hogging the common area. I pay rent too and just want to be able to use my own living room! AITA???",37,1745761067.0,AmItheAsshole,28,0.95,False

Real life Love Triangle! MAFS' Ryan Donnelly breaks his silence after hookup scandal with Scarlett Cooper - accusing her of betrayal and clout-chasing as she sides with Jacqui Burfoot amid bitter legal war.

Married At First Sight's Ryan Donnelly has broken his silence on his ill-fated hookup with Scarlett Cooper, accusing the former TV bride of betrayal and clout-chasing.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, the 37-year-old said he was 'disgusted' and 'dumbfounded' after former bride Scarlett unleashed a savage public attack just days after they met at the Australia's Most Influential People Party 2025.
The drama unfolded after Ryan and Scarlett crossed paths at the star-studded Sydney event earlier this month, where they hit it off and later spent the night together.

In a series of lengthy Instagram Stories, Scarlett, 31, alleged that Ryan became 'abusive' and 'scary' after their night together, accusing him of ghosting her and slamming his behaviour as 'embarrassing' and 'harmful' to his ongoing legal case with Jacqui Burfoot.

Scarlett claimed Ryan initially charmed her, describing him as 'hot,' 'intelligent,' and 'good in bed,' but said he later ignored her messages, prompting her to side with Jacqui in their bitter court battle.
'I'm actually team Jacqui,' Scarlett declared online. 'He's embarrassing himself and she's going to take him down.'

Scarlett also accused Ryan of harassing her with text messages, and claimed he was 'living it up' partying at clubs despite alleging he was a victim of domestic violence.
In a shocking breach of privacy, Scarlett shared Ryan's private phone number on social media, which was later re-shared by Jacqui to her followers.
But Ryan has now hit back - revealing a very different version of events.

'I'm still dumbfounded as to how it's reached this extent,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm tired of people weaponising their emotions and trying to bandwagon on domestic violence and MAFS just for their own clout.'

Ryan said he and Scarlett met through mutual friends and connected later in the evening, deciding to spend the night together after what he described as a 'fun and light-hearted vibe.'
'We literally hung out for half a day. We became intimate - but straight after, I started getting a concerning energy from her,' he explained.

Ryan said Scarlett quickly became possessive and pressured him emotionally.
'She started saying things like, ""You better not ghost me"" and ""You better not hurt me."" I already felt pressure to manage her emotions, and we had only just met.'

Despite their brief connection, Ryan revealed Scarlett was initially highly supportive of him, offering advice for his upcoming court case against Jacqui Burfoot.

'She was giving me advice on what to say to undermine Jacqui in court. She said she believed in me, that Jacqui was crazy. She even suggested we send photos to Woman's Day and make money off it.'

Ryan insisted he did not ghost Scarlett, but admitted he was slower to respond to messages because he was focused on preparing for his legal hearing.

'She knew I was tied up with my solicitor and court prep. She said, 'Let's just keep texting.' I agreed and told her we'd catch up again.'

However, just 48 hours after they met, Ryan said he was blindsided when Scarlett began publicly attacking him online.

'I was at the gym when a friend told me to look at her stories. I had a panic attack. She was ranting about me not responding fast enough, claiming she was used' he said.¬†

Ryan said he tried to call Scarlett to resolve the situation privately, but she ignored his calls.

'I trusted her. I confided in her about very personal things. And she betrayed that trust so publicly. I was genuinely hurt' he explained.¬†

Ryan also accused Scarlett of threatening to 'undermine' his court case by leaking private messages to Jacqui.

'She said she was going to send everything to Jacqui to destroy me. She knew how fragile my case was.'
Ryan's solicitor has since issued Scarlett a cease and desist notice for harassment and the unlawful sharing of private information.

'She shared my phone number online, which is illegal. I went to my solicitor and the police,' he said. 'Despite the cease and desist, she continued posting.'

Ryan said Jacqui also reshared Scarlett's illegal posts to her 86,000 followers - prompting a second legal warning.
'At the end of the day, Scarlett and Jacqui have only given me more evidence to support my case,' Ryan said.
Despite the ordeal, Ryan said he remains confident he has done nothing wrong.

'I didn't reject Scarlett. I didn't ghost her. I was focusing on a serious legal matter - and she knew that,' he said.
'I would've happily caught up with her for a coffee and kept things respectful, but she didn't give me that chance. She decided to blow it up online for clout.'
Ryan said the entire experience has been deeply stressful and emotionally draining.

'This whole situation could have seriously hurt my legal case. It's disturbing how quickly some people will flip and weaponise your vulnerability for attention,' he said.
He added: 'I trusted the wrong person for six hours - and I'll never make that mistake again.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Scarlett Cooper for further comment.

About 6 years ago I was hired at a tech startup in the USA. I was technically hired as a 10-99 contractor (almost everyone was) - so I was never an actual employee. 
I would say there was around 30 people in the office in total. But it was a gray area and I was expected to work and show up etc. 

This startup had a beautiful office in downtown, penthouse suite style. We always had free food in the kitchen and a free masseuse that would come to the office. 

My paycheck was very good - not amazing - but I was more than comfortable and paid more than average. 

Very quickly I started to realize that things felt ‚Äúoff‚Äù. No one seemed to really ‚Äúwork‚Äù although everyone appeared to look ‚Äúbusy‚Äù.  It was almost like everyone just pretended to look busy. 

Then, I started to notice that no one ever cared about my sales numbers or goals which in hindsight was a huge red flag. They also never really cared if anyone was at the office or not (yes I‚Äôm a 10-99 employee but they literally never asked me about my sales numbers ever lol). One day they pulled me into the office and gave me a raise! I literally had done barely anything. I had sold almost nothing yet. It was bizarre! 

Yes, this might sound like a dream job but it felt ‚Äústrange‚Äù and ‚Äúoff‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it. 

Finally a new sales manager got hired and after 3 weeks we went out for coffee. He explained he also got the ‚Äúweird‚Äù feeling and started to look into the financial things a bit more. 
He found out that every month $300,000 went to some weird account in California. The account was named something arbitrary like ‚ÄúEngineering‚Äù or ‚ÄúTech Support‚Äù and the money going out to this strange account made no sense. 
This manager quit the company a couple days later - he told me things didn‚Äôt feel right. 

A few weeks later, shit hit the fan. His investors found out they were laundering money, and quickly got the authorities involved. This whole company was nothing more than a money laundering front. Over night the CEO went to jail, I‚Äôve never seen or heard of him since, and the other C-Level executives scattered. 

Basically they just ‚Äúhired‚Äù people to make it look like a legitimate business. 

Thankfully because I was a 10-99 and wasn‚Äôt officially employed nothing happened to me at all. I just moved on to another job. 

I now realize how often this happens and that many people could be working jobs at money laundering fronts and have no idea, just like I did. I also have a keen eye now and can tell quickly if a job is legit or not. ",41,1745760271.0,confession,16,0.9,False

I'm not religious but I am spiritual.
The main problem today is me and my employer agree on alot of things but her Christian evangelist extremism views scare me. She's lived in a bubble all her life and says she doesn't know how to google. She has helicopter parents and is like a teen in a middle aged body. She is VERY gullible and doesn't question many things.

We talk about what's happening in the world while drinking coffee and the topic of Palestine comes up.
That's when she tells me she full heartily supports Israel. 
So when we go shopping together I boycott certain products but then she deliberately buys those products that I boycott. 
It's insufferable to experience tbh. I've sat down with her and asked if we can talk with a 3rd person to navigate this topic for us, she says she doesn't feel the need for it..
She doesn't see the Palestinians as humans. She believes in Armageddon and that I will burn in hell if I don't accept her version of Jesus. She thinks Israel in the bible is the same thing as the state of Israel. When I tell her about what I've read and learned through history books, she replies that I am wrong and she's right. 

There were alot of red flags when I started working for her. She told me unprompted that people have said to her she's in a cult. Halloween, tarot, astrology are topics off the table since she connects it with the devil. She talks well of black americans but horribly about muslims. She doesn't allow herself to listen to non christian music at home. She has ripped apart bibles from excessive reading, she starts all over if she mispeaks in prayers. 

She has alot of trauma. Was raised up christian but became an evangelist in her 20's. That time in her 20's she was at her lowest and found the religion though a radio station. I've read into Religious trauma and religious psychosis and can honestly say she hits alot of marks there.

I care alot about her but her religious beliefs scare me deeply. This is not the loving religion I grew up to know.

I need to start looking for another job because I don't know how to navigate this.  

I've talked to other people about this and no one has advice, that's why I thought of posting this here. Is this normal?

1k93tp2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k93tp2,Patience Is a Virtue I Hear,"I travel back and forth to my hometown frequently nowadays with Mom getting older. Instead of taking the frightening and expensive turnpike, I've always opted to take the byways through farm towns, winding up the mountain roads. I'm usually make this trek before the world's had their first cup of coffee with most of the roadside attractions closed. One place is an unassuming antique shop with rusting old appliances on the front porch. 

Yesterday, I had a late start driving back to the city and I noticed that the neon ""open"" sign was lit and flashing. When I opened the door, I was warmly greeted and they quickly asked if there was anything I was interested in. It's a good thing they offered to help  Although well organized by interest, the store was bursting with inventory. I asked them if they had any typewriters. There was some bickering about if they had machines in the sewing room or next to the MASSIVE dictaphone eraser tool. The proprietor ended up being the winner, and hidden behind wooden milk crates was a collection of typewriters. They had a lovely Sears Tower, a well-loved Brother LP7 and this teal case. 

I lunged for the teal case while asking the owner how much they cost. His said the range was between $25‚Äì$50 bucks. 

Normally, I put a potential acquisition through the wringer, checking all moving parts. When I opened up this teal case, it was like when they opened up the arc on Raiders. The machine looked pristine. While I was staring at the Olivetti's untouched condition, the salesman said it was $30. 

I keep telling myself I'm done collecting, but I keep finding treasures. I never thought I would find a reasonably priced Lettera 22 or Lettera 32. I've stumbled over overpriced machines that needed additional work that would require a professional touch. It does just go to prove that these machines are less rare than we think. Waiting for the right machine for the right price instead of rushing to bid on auction sites or overpriced consignment shops might be beneficial. I love the advice and rule of thumb from Sarah at Just My Typewriter, sticking to a price cap of $25 for a typewriter and waiting for the magic. I know that's not possible for all machines since certain machines are more geographically located due to manufacturing, but I've now found two brilliant Italian-made Olivettis in sleepy western Pennsylvania. 

Happy hunting and I'm sending out positive energy for everyone in the search for your grail at a steal of a price!!!! üëæüëçüåû",4,1745760094.0,typewriters,0,1.0,False

1k93svp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k93svp/explore_the_milk_boss_handheld_milk_frothers/,Explore the Milk Boss handheld milk frother's performance with this detailed review!,"The Milk Boss Milk Frother with item model number Milk Frother with Holster Stand is a convenience-packed gadget designed to bring barista-level frothing magic straight to your kitchen. As someone who uses a milk frother daily, this compact and vibrant pink device was enticing. After days of experimenting with coffee recipes, matcha, hot chocolate, and even whipping up scrambled eggs, I can share a balanced perspective detailing its perks and shortcomings.

**Aesthetic and Functional Design**  
The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek design paired with a cheerful pink hue. While some might find the color too bold, I felt it added a fun touch to my otherwise monochromatic kitchen. The improved holster stand is sturdy and ensures the frother doesn‚Äôt fall over awkwardly in storage. Its lightweight body (just 5.6 ounces) and compact size (9.76 x 2.87 x 2.83 inches) make it easy to handle, even during prolonged use. However, the material feels slightly plasticky, which could detract from its otherwise premium vibe.

**Performance Powerhouse**  
Armed with a titanium motor that spins at 13,000 RPM, this device delivers in seconds. I was able to whip up frothy milk in under 30 seconds consistently! From creamy cappuccino froth to dense foam for lattes, the texture it produced rivaled what I‚Äôve had at upscale coffee shops. While the motor is indeed powerful, it runs relatively quietly‚Äîa blessing during early-morning coffee-making sessions when my family is still asleep.  

[Want the lowest Milk Boss Milk Frother with Holster Stand price? Click Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08b446yhl/)

**Convenience in Cleaning**  
Cleaning this milk frother is refreshingly simple. I ran the stainless steel whisk under warm water, pulsed the motor a few times, and voil√†‚Äîit was clean. The simplicity of maintenance is a big deal for me since I loathe cleaning kitchen tools that come with too many parts.

**Power Source and Batteries**  
The handheld electric design is powered by two AA batteries (not included). During testing, I noticed the frother worked efficiently for weeks before requiring a battery change, even with heavy use. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that reliance on replaceable batteries can feel old-school‚Äîespecially when so many devices now come with rechargeable options.  

**Merits**  
- Effortlessly produces creamy froth for coffee, matcha, and more.  
- Portable, lightweight, and easy to store with the holster stand.  
- Quiet operation despite the powerful 13,000 RPM motor.    
- Hassle-free cleaning process.  

**Caveats**  
- Lacks rechargeable battery functionality; uses disposable AA batteries instead.  
- With extended use, the start button occasionally feels glitchy, as reported in longer-term reviews.  
- The body material feels more like regular nylon and less premium.  
- Short product lifespan reported by some users after around nine months.  

**Market Rivals**  
When comparing this frother to alternatives on the market, brands like Zulay, PowerLix, and Bonsenkitchen come to mind. The Milk Boss frother outperforms Zulay in froth texture but falls behind in durability since many users of Zulay cited that their frothers lasted longer. Bonsenkitchen offers a rechargeable model which I found quite convenient, but it doesn‚Äôt froth as evenly as this one. For sheer power and froth consistency, the Milk Boss milk frother remains one of the better contenders, particularly for matcha enthusiasts.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Is this frother worth the investment? That depends. Its affordability and high-quality froth-making abilities undoubtedly make it enticing for coffee lovers. However, if longevity and sturdier materials are at the top of your must-have list, consider alternative products within the same price range. What truly sets it apart is the frothing performance, which is hard to beat at this price point.

**AITAH for telling my dad to never contact me again after he chose his wife‚Äôs mom over me?**



Hi everyone, I (17F) am only really posting this since my dad‚Äôs family and even my mom are telling me that I‚Äôm in the wrong.

My parents got divorced when I was 12 and they had 50/50 custody so I would stay with my dad for a week then my mom. When I was 14 my dad got married to my stepmom (I refer to her as his wife) and I would only see them on the weekends until they moved and I only saw them whenever they visited (my mom got full custody)

Anyways last month they moved back to our city and got a 2 bedroom house, my dad had promised me the room before he moved back and told me he could do 50/50 again if me and my mom were okay with it and we were. I was so excited and even picked out furniture and bought stuff to decorate it.

Anyways they move into the house and invite me, they give me a tour and show me my ‚Äúroom‚Äù, I asked when I could start putting things in it and that‚Äôs when they told me that they were actually going to give the room to his wife‚Äôs mom, and since I was going away to college soon, it wasn‚Äôt like I was going to use the room much.

They also told me that instead of staying the full week that I can go on the weekends and sleep on their couch if I wanted to. I said no to that and texted my mom to pick me up. It‚Äôs been a month and I ghosted my dad fully, he even came to try to talk to me but I was at school, he‚Äôs been contacting my mom too which he hates doing.

So I just decided that I didn‚Äôt want to be in his life anymore or have him in mine, even though I barely did. I talked to my mom and for someone who hates my dad, she told me that I should just talk to him and spend time with him since I barely got to for 2 years.

I just decided to cut him off, it sounds impulsive I know but I sent him a long message detailing how emotionally neglected and unwanted he made me feel and to never contact me again. I blocked him and blocked his side of the family.

In the morning my mom woke me up at 5am and asked what I did, almost my dads entire family have been blowing up her phone asking what she said/did that made me want to cut off my dad.

During school I even got a few messages from my cousins on insta that I forgot to block insulting me. My mom showed me some of the messages and some are insulting both of us.

My dad even sent a message apologizing to me and said I broke his heart, his wife is sending disgusting messages towards my mom. I feel awful because I didn‚Äôt expect them to attack not only me but my mom, harshly at that. I feel like I messed up and want to know if what I did was the right thing.

SMALL UPDATE: My mom talked to my dad and set up a time to talk tomorrow after school, my mom‚Äôs making me talk to him and reconcile but I really don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôm trying to convince her not to force me to go but she‚Äôs threatening to take away my phone/laptop that I need for school and other things. I‚Äôll update you guys tomorrow.

**Present-Duck4273**

*Unblock him temporarily to let him know that his family and wife harassing you and your mom is exactly why you want no contact with any of them. He continues to take no accountability for his own actions and blame you and your mom instead. Tell him your mom is against your decision, but his family‚Äôs attack has reassured you that you made the right decision. I would even send screenshots of messages. Ask him to call off his family and nasty wife. That for now you stand by your decision and that maybe in the future you will change your mind, but if it continues it will only drive you further from him. At that point you can either leave him unblocked to get a response or re-block.*

**Sparkig1rl**

*This is not ok, you're NTA. Your dad took away your room to give to his wife's mother and then said you can sleep on the couch? WTF, how often does her mom visit? He barely saw you or made any effort why keep emotionally damaging yourself? I'd tell his family well he chose his wife over me years ago I guess I shouldn't be surprised he chose her mother over me too, I decided I don't deserve to be treated as an old sweater only useful when he needs me.*

>OOP: Yeah exactly also from my knowledge not much, her mom is wild and goes to Vegas a lot, basically lives there and she‚Äôs rarely home in her own house now so like she won‚Äôt be in the room much either unless she‚Äôs back in town to which probably a lot as she won‚Äôt need to pay bills üò≠ thank you so much



**\*\*Judgement - NTA\*\***



**Update - 2 days later**



Hi guys, right now I‚Äôm at a friend‚Äôs house and going to stay the night. If you guys saw the small update I did on my last post my mom was making me see my dad in person today to try and reconcile, she was threatening to take away things I need and use like my phone so I had to go, after school she picked me up and we drove to his house.

I made sure to try and mentally prepare what I wanted to say/do, I really didn‚Äôt want to talk to him but since I was forced I decided to take some advice from my last post and basically just talk about times I felt neglected and why I wanted to cut him off, including the harassment from his family.

When I got there, I thought it was just going to be him, me and mom but I was wrong, my mom came inside with me, but my dad told me to sit in the dining room and wait. They stayed talking at the door and I went to the dining room, my dad‚Äôs wife who I‚Äôll just call Becca since it‚Äôs close to her name and her mom were sitting there.

They told me to sit down while we wait for my dad, these women looked so angry at me and I felt uncomfortable, I sat and was on my phone and I could just feel and see them staring. I wanted to get up and leave but my dad eventually came and sat down, he told me we needed to talk but I asked him where my mom was and he said that she left, I asked why and he ignored me.

Then he started talking about how sorry he was for what I felt but that Becca‚Äôs mom wanted the room and she already broke her lease from her apartment, and was thinking of quitting her job. Guys, this lady is 53 and acts like shes my age, shes gotten fired from all her jobs or quit because they were ‚Äúhard‚Äù. For everyone thinking of a small frail old lady, you‚Äôre wrong. Picture someone who loves Vegas, drinking and party. There you go.

I was mad, they all took turns talking and basically said words that mean ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sorry if you‚Äôre upset but you‚Äôre dramatic and you being dramatic affects us so we‚Äôll give you a bunch of excuses and make you seem like the bad guy,‚Äù I just wanted to leave so I said something like ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt just because of the room, it‚Äôs the promises that were broken and how you treat me‚Äù and I gave examples of things he‚Äôs done that hurt me, including the harassment and when I mentioned it, Becca snorted and rolled her eyes at me and told me that I‚Äôm being dramatic with the word ‚Äúharassment‚Äù and it was towards my mom and not me.

Me and Becca got into an ‚Äúargument‚Äù but it was more like me going ‚Äúokay sure, but you still did this‚Äù and her excusing it and raising her voice. I decided to end that and just tell them that I‚Äôm not going to reconcile with them, if I have to talk to them in the future I will only if necessary but for now, I don‚Äôt want to build a relationship since we haven‚Äôt had one in years.

When I asked when my mom was coming back, they told me she wasn‚Äôt until Monday. This is when I got really upset and went outside, I didn‚Äôt want to be inside or around them anymore and I called/texted my mom for an hour straight. I even walked to a small plaza nearby just so I could be away from them, my mom didn‚Äôt answer and it was getting late.

I didn‚Äôt want to involve my friends or anything but it seemed like the only choice so I asked one of my friends if she could come pick me up and if I can stay with her. She said yes and now I‚Äôm at her house, shes doing homework right now so I‚Äôm just in her living room watching tv waiting for her to be done. Her mom told me I can stay the whole weekend if I‚Äôm okay with going to church on Sunday and can borrow my friend‚Äôs clothes.

I texted my mom and let her know I‚Äôm staying with a friend and I still haven‚Äôt heard back from her, I think she turned her phone off. Honestly I want to cry out of anger, I‚Äôm so confused as to what happened, I‚Äôm mad, very mad but also very numb. I don‚Äôt know what this means, I left my mom voicemails crying asking why she left and wasn‚Äôt picking up and venting to her so I guess maybe I feel numb because of that. Who knows, I‚Äôll try to give you guys an update but who knows what that will be.

**Armorer-**

*This is such a depressing update, I didn‚Äôt expect your mother to abandon you like this but at least you have your friends can you maybe stay with them for a while?*

**SapphireTigerScales**

*OP!! Not saying to leave your friends house but if either of your parents report you as a runaway it can get your friend and their parents in trouble. Big legal jail time trouble. I helped a runaway friend whose parents were forcing him into drugs and beating him, but it wasn't them that got in trouble it was me for keeping him safe. If you are in the US please call the non emergency police number for your city and say you are reporting your whereabouts after a fight and bad communication with your parents. Tell them you did not feel safe in your dad's household and tried to contact your mom but couldn't, so you went to a place you feel safe. That way if your dad calls you in as a runaway your friend and their parents will be a little protected!!!*

**MomLovedCoffee**

*Your mom just left you to be attacked by your dad's wife and her mooch mother? I just cannot fathom doing that to my daughter. I, also, cannot fathom being your parent and watching my significant other tell my child they're being dramatic because they're tired of broken promises. I can imagine you didn't feel safe, and needed to get away. I'm glad you're staying at your friend's house.*

*Your dad isn't worth your time because of his wife. Just let them be. I would imagine that your parents are trying to cut down on his support by getting you sometimes. (I.e. your dad pays less, and your mom gets a break while you stay with your dad.) If your dad wants to see you, tell him teenage girls need privacy. He can either kick mooching Mil to the curb, or get a bigger house/apartment/condo.*

**Vuk-a**

*She got sat in front of a firing squad. The mum needs a damn good reason or a response otherwise their relationship is gonna be forever strained*

**iamshashank08**

*Your mom leaving you there was wrong, She should have protected you, not forced you to stay in a bad situation. You didn‚Äôt deserve that..*

1k93ptc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k93ptc/me_23m_suffering_from_my_girlfriends_25f_behavior/,Me (23M) suffering from my girlfriend's (25F) behavior for 2 years,"We've been together for 2 years now, it started as a long distance relationship and now that I (23M) work closer to her (25F) we see each other a bit more frequently (maybe once a month). Our relationship began very spontaneously, to the point that i feel that it happened too fast... And it didn't take long before i started picking up bad behavior from her side.

During our first month of the relationship i was getting messages from a female friend that i knew since high school, i didn't bother to tell my girlfriend that we were talking because she is a really close friend after all, and once she knew she told me to immediately block her and stop talking to her, i tried to explain everything but she said ""me or her"" and that she would do the same for me too.

I didn't want to argue more and i did what she asked me to, at that time she convinced me that i was wrong, and i believed it because I didn't have a serious relationship before and I only knew one girl before her. 

That's not the only time she did that, i was once invited to go out and grab a coffee with 2 female friends that i used to be really close to at that time, and i thought it would be better if i told my girlfriend that i will be going out with them. She said it was okay, but made me feel bad about it, she wasn't talking to me like she used to and she was really mad but didn't bother to tell me even though i asked her why her tone changed. I  got lectured about any female that i ever came across, even ones that are way too old for me that i come in contact with at work. One time a coworker (40F) asked me to go grab launch together and she wanted to pay for it as a thank you gesture for welcoming and integrating her as a new hire. And of course to honor my loyalty to her i told my girlfriend that i will be having launch with a coworker, she said ""you can't, thats inappropriate"" and it was clearly a professional setting and nothing more than that.

Jealousy wasn't the only problem,  The other problem was the constant monitoring of everything that i do.
I couldn't go 2 hours without her spamming me with messages asking what am i doing, even at work i would be asked to be more available to her, i had to spend time with her every night or she would feel sad and lonely, and i would feel guilty for not doing it even if i was too tired from work. It didn't bother me most of the time, until i started feeling very stressed from trying to finish my studies and perform well at my job. I already had a lot of pressure and trying to keep up with her drained me even more.

One night we were playing a video game together, i complimented another player for doing well, and she said ""you only say good things about other people and never say good things about me"", i couldn't believe she would act so irrationally over a message written to a stranger in a game, i told her that she is very childish and she loves to start useless fights, i hung up on her and didn't talk to her for a day, i told her that her behavior is toxic and that its unthankful of her to say that i never compliment her even though i always push her do better in life and motivated her with good words. It hurt me a lot that she would make me so angry over a such a stupid thing.

After telling her that her behavior is unacceptable, she said that i ruined this relationship forever with my words and that she will never be the same anymore. To this day our relationship is nothing like it used to be, all the guilt was put on me for trying to point the obvious, she said she is very sad because she acknowledged that all i said about her is true, the jealousy, the trust issues and the extreme surveillance.

I mentioned before that at the beginning of the relationship everything happened too fast, now i feel like I wasn't given enough time to think about my options. One shocking thing she told me is that the first time that we slept together, she did it so that i dont leave her, but since that time she did it out of love. All i felt from it is that i was entrapped in this relationship and she used sex as a means of keeping me in, nothing felt innocent anymore...

I wouldn't be writing this if I didn't love her, or if i feel like she doesn't love me, but she clearly stated that if i want to stay with her i have to deal with her as she is. I feel lost and i can't tell if all the manipulation is true.

Have i been blinded with love this whole time? Am i a victim of manipulation and entrapment? Was she purposefully isolating me from all of my close friends?Have i been dealing with a mentally unstable person this whole time and somehow endured it for 2 years?",1,1745759772.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

so.. I (F22) met this guy (M23 I think) a while ago. we met at a social event and the next day he invited me for a coffee so we spent some time together, but then he immediately told me he was interested in dating me but directly added that we can also stay friends and see, if it happens it happens and if it doesn't it doesn't. I told him I wasn't interested in dating at this time but sure, we could be friends. since then I did always have his expectations in mind though plus I got busy again so we didn't really hang out anymore. the week after he told me to just forget his confession and to just stay friends and after that we barely even spoke anymore.

one situation I personally would a bit weird was how some time after that he messaged me asking me if I could lend him a suitcase. I told him the one I have would be too small for what he asked for and he asked me to maybe bring one from my family's home and I told him I'd check but I wouldn't be there for the next two weeks. he then kept repeating how I should check there and bring one for him and I told him I'll check next time I'm there and then he just said ""finally you get it"" and like I got it from the beginning, I just told him it won't happen as quickly as he wanted it to.

anyway, he's not from my country but he studies here and yesterday he approached me telling me how he's having a hard time because the language class clashes with another class he has to take but he needs a certain level until the end of the semester and if I couldn't meet with him once a week to practise for 15-30 minutes. I said sure and that we'd talk about the specific time. I then left for the rest of the day and was too exhausted to plan anything when I got home, especially since the earliest I'd do this would be Monday anyways. yesterday he sent me one message telling me he depends on me to find 30 minutes per week for him and called me by my name. and today he kept texting me which is okay, I understand he's stressed but I had classes the entire day and left to go home for the weekend immediately. he said if I can't make it to let him know so he can look for someone else and how he will never forget this from me. what bothered me though is how he just randomly sent me two messages writing my name but incorrectly. 

it might be petty but he knows how to write my name, it's on my account and I don't know what his intentions are with that. i don't know, I don't feel too well anymore about the idea. he didn't do anything wrong per se but I don't know I just feel off and stressed every time I interact with him.. I'm considering just telling him one time slot in between my classes where I wouldn't have anything to do anyways and if that doesn't work to tell him he should look for someone else but I feel kinda bad doing that. but that's the only time slot in between classes I know I'll be free every week so it's the least stressful for me.

1k93m8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1k93m8g/i_basically_stole_1000_1500_from_my_abusive_ex/,I basically stole $1000 ($1500?) from my abusive ex but legally got away with it,"I was misdiagnosed for 30 years. Since unmasking I have become a completely different person than I was before. I am confident, I love myself, I am brave and stand up to men. This story is part of how I developed that confidence. I hope it helps someone. 

Necessary background information. I, 32F, married my ex-husband, let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúJack,‚Äù 35M, when we were 24 and 27. Jack had recently finished serving 4 years in the Marine Corps (infantry) and I was drawn to his darkness and stories.  Being the neglected helpful eldest daughter, I ultimately was broken myself and wanted to fix him. It didnt work. I was emotionally immature and had no coping skills while he was violent and drank too much. We quickly became abusive to each other and I filed for divorce by age 27. This was 5 years ago. Before this story took place I hadn‚Äôt spoken to him since before the pandemic.

Because Jack was a veteran, we used Navy Federal Credit Union as our daily bank for checking and savings. The name of the bank is misleading. Navy Fed is the bank of the military and all branches use it, including veterans, not just the Navy. Civilians cannot bank there but family members of military members and veterans can. Keep that in mind, it becomes important later.

Jack and I‚Äôs divorce decree stated that financially, we agreed to move forward independently and only have separate bank accounts ‚Äúfree and clear‚Äù of the other party. We were supposed to close the joint checking account or one of us should‚Äôve been removed. We did not. I dont know if we didnt understand what we agreed to or just forgot. We were both kids who had to grow up too fast and were dealing with an extraordinary amount of unhealed trauma. Either way, the joint checking account stayed open accidentally with a balance of less than one dollar.

Fast forward to spring 2023. I was getting my life together and reviewing old bank account and financial information. I called Navy Federal and learned that the account was still open, but to close it they would need to contact Jack. At the time I was unaware of the terms of the divorce degree so I told the representative not to bother and that I didnt care if the account existed. She asked if I wanted to open my own checking account with Navy Federal and explained that the bank allows surviving and divorced spouses to continue banking with them. Learning about this policy warmed my heart because belonging to the military community is truly a niche experience that you cannot understand unless you have lived it.  It was nice to feel included and acknowledged so I agreed to open my own checking account with them and use it as an emergency funds account. I redownloaded the Navy Fed app onto my phone where I could see my balance in my new account as well as the few cents left in the abandoned shared checking account with Jack.

In August 2023 I noticed large sums of money were being deposited into Jack and I‚Äôs shared checking account, and then immediately transferred into another account. The description was limited characters but I could tell it was some sort of FMLA or government payment. I don‚Äôt remember the exact amounts but it was something like $500 on Monday, $439 on Tuesday, $1017 on Tuesday, $400 on Wednesday, $700 on Thursday. I‚Äôm guessing several weekly claims were being reviewed and now Jack was receiving the deposits for each week that was approved.

I was faced with a unique opportunity. I called Navy Federal and confirmed that because I was the joint owner of the account, that I had every right to transfer that money into my own checking account exactly like Jack was doing. The representative confirmed. Multiple times. I hung up and felt my heartbeat racing.

I went to the settings section of the Navy Fed app and set up daily balance text messages and notifications of any deposits. I changed my settings so I would be notified of any deposits even in Do Not Disturb mode.

The next day I was alerted there was $1000 in the account. I transferred it to my new individual checking account. My heart rate was through the roof. I immediately sent the money to my new landlord as I was getting ready to move September 1 and was short $1000. It seemed like a divine compensation gift. I moved into my new apartment on September 1 and updated my address with the post office. Coincidentally my mailbox at my new apartment was broken and I couldnt receive mail. This detail becomes important too.

I didnt start regularly receiving my mail at my new apartment until late October 2023. USPS had made an error with the change of address, and the post office was unable to deliver mail to the broken mailbox. Most of my mail from late September and October was lost. It was a very messy and frustrating time. After many hours on the phone with various USPS agents, in mid September the post office gave me a large bucket of mail that they hadn‚Äôt been able to deliver since I‚Äôd moved. In that bucket was Jack‚Äôs court document. It was addressed to my previous address and had been forwarded to my new apartment. Legally though, he sent it to the wrong address and couldn‚Äôt prove it had been delivered. It was a citation for being in contempt of court for failing to appear at a court date. What court date??

I called the courthouse in Connecticut and learned Jack had gone to court and filed a motion for contempt, claiming that I failed to adhere to the terms of our divorce decree because I ‚Äúwithdrew $1000 from his bank account‚Äù and we were supposed to maintain our own. His new girlfriend/baby momma ‚ÄúAmy‚Äù had filled out the documents and found my old address, but because I moved a few weeks after transferring the $1000 she hadn‚Äôt been able to find my new one. They had also filed the ‚Äúfailure to appear‚Äù citation because apparently a court date had been scheduled and I missed it weeks ago. I had no idea any of this was happening because I hadn‚Äôt been receiving my mail.

I explained to the clerk that I had recently moved and never received any documentation from Jack or Amy notifying me of the court date. If I had known about it, I would have done something.

While the clerk was working on updating documents on their end, I think at this point is when I reached out to Jack via text message. I offered to return the $1000 to him immediately on Venmo, but threw in a line about how he must be in poor financial shape if he was this desperate for $1000. Being a broken narcissist, he said no and stated the money needed to be returned to the original bank account by a certified check, or some word salad answer that I could tell him or Amy had copy/pasted off Google. Call it psychic abilities, clairvoyance, or autistic enchanted pattern recognition, but I knew I was in the right and declining the money would be a problem for them later. I said ok and we could argue it out in court.

Jack and Amy had gone to court on our first scheduled court date and were very excited that I failed to show up. They had filed that motion for contempt of court for my failure to appear but the court withdrew that once they realized I was not properly served in the first place and wasn‚Äôt receiving any mail. They told Jack and Amy that before rescheduling a new court date, they would have to properly serve me. Because I was living in Boston and not Connecticut like them, this meant hiring a Marshall to deliver the documents to me. They could have sent the letter through certified mail, but they weren‚Äôt sure about my new address and all my mail kept getting ‚Äúreturned to sender‚Äù during the USPS chaos. I found all of this hilarious honestly.

We then started playing a complicated game of cat and mouse. Jack and Amy couldn‚Äôt figure out my new address. They contacted the Boston sheriffs department and tried to have the sheriff deliver the papers to me. He couldn‚Äôt find my new address either. So he called me and texted me and tried to get me to come to his office. He was inappropriate, did not introduce himself, refused to identify himself, and was very rude and disrespectful. I made plans to meet him in a couple days while I bought myself time to do some research. I looked up the laws around this and notified him that he failed to introduce himself properly, I understood he was trying to deceive me, and I have no obligation to come pick up the papers and make my ex-husband‚Äòs job easier. He said I would be in big trouble if he had to tell the judge in Connecticut that he couldn‚Äôt get a hold of me. I said that wasn‚Äôt my problem. I knew I was in the right and was starting to be more confident around men after years of letting them treat me badly.

Jack and Amy were getting furious. The sheriffs department couldn‚Äôt find me, they couldn‚Äôt figure out my address to mail anything certified. Amy got creative.

During this time I was providing childcare and behavior support services. I got an email from a mother who wanted to meet up with me in January after the holidays. We made plans to get coffee near my apartment. Looking back, I noted that she seemed confused about the layout of the city and I wondered if she was lying to me about where she lived. I never assume malice when ignorance will suffice, so I chalked it up to her being new to the city or maybe she was running an errand nearby and that‚Äôs why she was so willing to meet so far from her house with a young child. We also did not do a FaceTime call before I met her. I usually FaceTime someone that I have met on a dating app before meeting them in real life, and this experience taught me that I need to apply that same logic and safety to meeting parents.

I headed to the coffee shop and was ready for my interview. At this time, a gentleman walked up to me and asked if I was [My Name]. I said yes but I wasn‚Äôt available to talk because I had an interview literally right now. He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your interview‚Äù and handed me a manila folder with a stack of papers inside. He said ‚Äúthese are from your ex-husband Jack.‚Äù Now I must admit that while I won the war, Jack and Amy definitely won this battle. She found my email on a parenting forum and hired a literal private detective to come track me down in my city. They got me good, I will admit that! So now I had been formally served and we could officially schedule a new court date. Almost 6 months had passed since I transferred the $1000 in August. I was wasting their time and they were getting frustrated.

I immediately filed paperwork with the court to request a virtual appearance. I used to ChatGPT to help me write my reasoning, and stated that Jack and I had a very tumultuous and abusive relationship and that both of us lacked maturity at the time we were together. I said that I had a donut tire on my car and could not drive to Connecticut, and seeing him would cause me substantial distress anyway. The judge granted my request for a phone appearance. I called Navy Federal one more time to make sure that I was completely within my rights to transfer the money into my own checking account exactly as Jack had done. Once again, Navy Fed confirmed.

Finally the court date arrived and I called in over the phone. I would have to hear Jack‚Äôs voice but I didn‚Äôt have to see him or have direct conversation. Before we entered the courtroom, a mediator explained that Jack was now seeking $1500 to cover the cost of a private detective that he had to hire to track me down. He said we could avoid seeing the judge if we just settled now. I was shocked at the audacity! I laughed and told the mediator I was not paying him one dollar and I would be happy to go see the judge and explain why.

I wait half an hour. Then I am conferenced into a call in the courtroom with the judge and Jack. Jack explains that I violated the divorce decree because I failed to maintain my own bank accounts and I stole $1000 from him. I was calm, cool, collected, and excited for my turn to speak.

I thanked Jack for sharing his side of the story and explained to him and the judge that Jack and I were actually both in violation of our divorce decree. The bank account in question is a joint checking account which had been confirmed by Navy Federal several times. Jack and I should have closed this joint account when we got divorced several years ago, but it seems both of us were actually in contempt of court because both of us failed to close the account. I apologized to the judge and admitted that it was obvious that neither of us understood the terms and conditions of our divorce decree.

Jack was allowed to reply. He was angry and said that I am not allowed to bank at Navy Federal as it is ‚Äúmilitary only‚Äù and this information could not possibly be true. The judge allowed me to politely interrupt him and I explained that Navy Federal actually invites ‚Äúformer and surviving spouses‚Äù to continue banking with the branch. I explained that I had every right to transfer the money from our shared account into my own checking account, exactly as Jack had done.

I also took this opportunity to inform the judge that I had texted Jack several months ago and offered to return the $1000 immediately via Venmo. Jack had refused at the time, and I shared that his behavior made me suspect that this case was not really about the money, rather about getting revenge on his ex-wife and wanting to see me punished after outsmarting him. The judge was a woman and I think this sealed the case in her mind. She saw exactly what this was.

She said that if Jack and I could not come to an agreement, it sounded like we would need to schedule a date to go to trial. Jack is an idiot but realized he was going to lose if we went to trial. He asked the judge if we could avoid going to trial by withdrawing his motion and ‚Äújust dropping this whole thing.‚Äù The judge confirmed that if he dropped his contempt of court charge, then yes, it would essentially all go away. Jack agreed and the judge confirmed if that was ok with me. You could hear me smiling through the phone as I said ‚Äúyes your honor. That‚Äôs perfectly fine with me.‚Äù We agreed to close the account and I let out one final whoop of glee before hanging up the phone. I made sure that entire courtroom heard me celebrate. I had just legally stolen $1000 from my ex and cost him an additional $500 for a private detective.

Now you‚Äôll notice I didn‚Äôt post asking if I‚Äôm the AH because I know I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm not concerned about Jack and Amy‚Äòs financial situation at all. I met Jack soon after he discharged and I spent two years of my life bringing him to Comp and Pen appointments, helping find doctors to complete his DBQs, and helped him reach 100% P&T status in the military. This means he is permanently disabled but is still allowed to work as much as he wants, and receives a check for thousands of dollars every month for the rest of his life. When we got divorced, I lacked confidence and essentially ran and left him everything. He had the house, the washer and dryer my parents gifted us for our wedding‚Ä¶. everything. He‚Äôs doing just fine and I don‚Äôt feel bad at all. He had the opportunity for me to send the money back and he refused.

I do feel a little bit sad because I found out him and Amy gave birth to twins! So the money was probably FMLA for his paternity leave. He transferred several thousand in payments before I got involved though so again I really don‚Äôt feel bad at all. When my mother was getting divorced from my stepfather, she did similar things and my stepfather would tell anyone he could that she was stealing his money and robbing him. I can‚Äôt help but feel a little bit proud and just like my mom.

So this is my final message. Close those joint accounts and swallow your pride!

1k93loj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdhdRelationships/comments/1k93loj/crushed_after_finding_out_a_coworker_i_liked_hung/,Crushed After Finding Out a Coworker I Liked Hung Out With My Employee Instead ‚Äî Old Wounds Reopened,"I (48m) work with this woman (35f) that has ADHD (Let's call her Clara).  When she first started, I didn't really notice her at all.  As we began working together, I got to know her and started developing a crush. This happened when I made a stupid joke, she laughed and she placed her hand on my arm.  I took this as a signal that maybe she was slightly interested. A couple more weeks, we developed a rapport and it was an outstanding working relationship.  I kept getting what seemed to be small signals from her that someone is comfortable with someone.  Such as being well within the ""Intimacy"" zone when looking at someone on a monitor.  Meanwhile, I too was trying to send small signals, that I was interested in more than friendship.  Myself, having jumped into things way to fast before, I didn't want to do that too fast.  And I told myself I did not want to do that again.  I figured I'd ""Slow-burn"".  Get to know her on a much deeper level.  For one, to process if I really wanted to date her, and also because we worked in the same building.



I asked her out for a coffee, and we went out Feb 22nd on my Birthday, had a good time just sitting and getting to know each other.  Here's when things start to fall apart.  Thing go along in the office as normal, and I feel nothing had changed.  We still act the same way towards each other and everything seems fine, so a couple of weeks later, I asked her out again.  When I did, she seemed a bit awkward, started to fidget and said maybe sometime after march madness.  She's a person super into sports.  She also does a podcast with some of her friends, so i figured that it could be that she's actually busy. She's also probably got a larger social circle than me as well, and may be super busy with other friends, family and other stuff going on.   Then for the next few weeks, things go along at work just fine.  It seems nothing between us (meaning interactions) had seeming changed.  Everything seemed OK.   After march madness was over, I wait about another week and asked her out again.  This time, she explains that her older brother is gone hiking in Spain, and her father (78) would be going back to NY to visit family in June.  She said that she would feel less guilty leaving her dad home alone. Now, as this point, if she was neuro-typical I would have jumped ship and not have asked her out again.  I had read up on ADHD during the last few months, and figured maybe this was an ADHD Thing, or maybe some RSD, or something that would explain maybe why she was a little awkward when I asked her out and why maybe she kept pushing out hanging out together.  I gave her a little more space and the benefit of a doubt.  I did try to give her an out during this last time too.  Telling her it's OK to say no, and that I don't want to be ""That guy"" that just keeps asking. But she insisted that it's OK and we should definitely plan something. This is now April 18th so this has been about two months time period, where I've been trying to nail down a time and date to hang out. My thinking was again, if she was neuro-typical, I would have stopped asking her much sooner, giving the fact she didn't give me a solid date and time because I was thinking this may be an RSD thing or something.  Fast forward to a week later, and I checked in with her Friday afternoon at the end of the day.  I asked her if she had figured out when her dad was going to NY, and she said it was going to probably be around mothers day.  Again, I tried to give her some more outs. Telling her it's ok to say that she didn't want to go and that'd be OK with me.  I told her I didn't want her to feel awkward and I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable and asked her should I keep checking in with her and asking, and she said yes, that I should. I asked her and verified with her, its taken this long to plan something was because she would feel guilty about leaving her 78 year old dad home alone and she said yes.  Asked her if she's the primary caregiver of her father and she said yes, that her older brother lives with them half the year and can help out (but he's off to Spain hiking).  I told her that's a great quality to have, that she's very family oriented and takes care of her father.  As i was leaving, I asked her if she was doing anything fun for the weekend, and she said not really, just doing work around the house, etc.  I said have a good weekend, and went on my way.



Here's when things when sideways.  After I left, I saw my employee (let's call him Evan) (the guy that reports to me), still in his office, which at this time of day i found odd as he usually leaves way before this time.  I asked him why he was still at work (to ask if there was an issue with work), and he said no, that he was clocked out and he had plans in the area and he was just waiting.  I said OK, have a good weekend. (at this point in time, I had my suspicions that something was up).  Backing up a little, during the last couple of weeks, i had started noticing Clara start exhibiting the same behavior towards me that caught my attention, such as laughing at my stupid jokes, high-fiving, coming to my office a lot, towards Evan.  Back to the sideways night, as i was leaving I saw my employee Evan, walking out to his car to leave and asked him what he was doing tonight as it sounded like fun.  He awkwardly told me he was going to hand out with Clara.  I was a bit shocked.  I told him to be careful and that I have had an an employee (his predecessor) develop a relationship with someone in the office, and it didn't end well for them.  He understood and said he looked in the Employee Handbook and said that it said that relationships in the company like that was ok (which is is).  In the back of my mind, I wanted to tell Evan, that I've been trying to hang out with Clara for a couple months now, but I held back doing that.   I told him to have a good time, and tell Clara that I said Hi.  I walked to my car, closed the door, and screamed at the top of my lungs.



Backstory:  nearly a decade or so ago now, I had interest in a woman at work someone in the company for a couple of weeks.  This girl practically ghosted me and didn't seem to want to hang out any more.  I just let it go at the time, figuring she wasn't interested. Things were amicable between the woman and myself and work went on as normal.  Again, I was OK, and we were OK personally.  About two weeks after I was ghosted, my employee at the time (remember, this a decade ago so different employee that reports to me) starts dating the woman I was seeing.  This employee knew I had interested in that woman, and so I felt a bit betrayed.  He at the time was dating another woman (a friend of mine) in the company, and he broke up with my friend, to date the girl I had interest in.  This stirred up some resentment in myself (as he jumped from dating my friend, to dating the girl i had interest in), so I felt betrayed by my employee on two accounts.  Like he swooped in and that woman chose him over me.  Which normally, I'd let roll off my back, but because of my friend also left for this woman, I felt i could no longer trust my employee.  They both left the company, Him first about a month later, and she left about 6 months later, got married and had a baby together.  They're now divorced and I'm laughing on the inside about this situation nearly a decade later.



The current events had triggered something in me and it felt like this was happening again.  Nearly an exact carbon copy of the situation.  Later that night, Clara texted me;



""Hey, just wanted to clear things up.  Hanging out with Evan was spur of the moment and just getting to know each other. Nothing against you! I'm just super awkward and over think things""



I myself feel super anxiety and hold back from channeling my mom (which has no filter); and reply ""No worries! All good.""



She then texts back:  ""I do apologize though. You asked me what I was doing and I should have said something.  I just didn't want to make you feel bad because it was last minute and we've been planning to hang out.  I should have just said something. Again I'm super awkward and apologize.""



In which I reply, ""No worries. No need to apologize. Have a good weekend""





And here's the thing.  It didn't upset me that she didn't tell me what she was doing that night.  It upset me that I felt lied to for the last several weeks.  That she's been using her dad as reason to not hang out because she would feel guilty about leaving him alone if we were to go out.  I feel like my trust in her has been broken.  I feel like dating this woman is no longer an option.  and I also feel like further developing any kind of friendship with her is also no longer an option.  I am not going to be asking her to hang out any longer.   Even though I said no worries, in text to her this has eaten me up inside all weekend because first, I was really hoping to develop at least a friendship with Clara. And secondly, this PTSD from the nearly a decade ago drama, feels that it's happening again and that my Employee Evan will start dating her. I am the type of guy that can be friends with Ex's.  I never speak poorly about them to others, and treat them all with respect and dignity.  Breakups can be hard, but I've found that's no reason to treat someone poorly and harbor ill feelings towards them.



Now, what to do about it?  



Not mention anything more to either of them?  Walk into work, get shyt done and go home?  I'm going to be feeling awkward around both of them for a while.  Trying to give myself some space, between both of them and the situation.  I don't see myself being my cheery self around them for a little while.  If they do start dating, it's going to crush me a little more. I'll get through it of course, but it would hurt more than it does now for a while.



Tell her I want to tell her a story (regarding my experience nearly a decade ago) and tell her how that affected me? Also let her know that I need to get some things off my chest and that I'd prefer she make time to do this in person with me sooner rather than later.  That it feels as though she broke my trust and that even building a friendship with her now would be difficult due to what I felt were lies (her feeling guilty about leaving her dad home alone, and that she accepted an invite from my employee for a ""spur of the moment"" hangout with my employee that has intentions to date her, when I've been trying to make plans with her for weeks now).



Tell my employee of my story? He has no idea of my story, or that I was trying to develop a friendship with her out of work or had any developing feelings for her.



Trying to figure out what my next steps should be.



TL;DR:

48M developed feelings for 35F coworker Clara, who has ADHD. After months of friendly interactions and slow efforts to ask her out, she kept postponing due to family obligations (especially caring for her elderly dad). Meanwhile, everything at work seemed normal. Then OP finds out Clara spontaneously hung out with his employee Evan after work ‚Äî the same night she told OP she had no plans. This triggered old trauma for OP, reminding him of a similar work betrayal a decade ago. OP feels lied to, betrayed, and is deeply hurt. Now debating whether to just stay professional and distance himself, or to tell Clara and/or Evan how this has affected him.",0,1745759416.0,AdhdRelationships,8,0.5,False

Things escalated recently and I think I need to go low contact. Feeling a ton of guilt that I should be helping her instead of judging. Need advice or reassurance ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Hi all, 

Having issues with my mom my entire life. I am trying to figure out if her behaviour is narcissism or some other mental health issue and maybe I need to get her checked by a doctor. I need someone who isn‚Äôt involved to just tell me what to do lol 

I 35F feel sad because when my mom 67F was on her meds she was great! A few years ago she decided she was fine and got off her meds. it has been a steady decline and she can‚Äôt compensate for her mental health issues anymore. It‚Äôs at a whole other level recently. 

I have always had very strict boundaries with her and my little family. I had a very difficult pregnancy (severe vomitting and nausea , daily IV fluids then PICC line for nausea, extra meds etc etc). She loved reminding me that I had to be prepared for something to be wrong with my baby and how he would probably be autistic. Looking back it set me up for a pretty rough post partum- the autism anxiety turned into her constantly warning me about SIDS the first year. 

She was the only grandparent who would offer to help us. My son had colic so we didn‚Äôt really have a choice we were so tired and she was genuinely great with him. 

This past Easter I set up expectations that we weren‚Äôt going to attend family gatherings but she could come over for tea. 

She shows up on Good Friday bringing in random crap from a thrift store and a huge reusable bag filled with percussion instruments for kids.  I suffer from daily migraines /PTSD so I am super sensitive to noise. I was recently diagnosed with Post Trauma Vision Syndome and it‚Äôs hard for me to be around noise.  that sort of set the tone for the coffee date lol 

She monologues for just under an hour. She‚Äôs rambling about all these different things. Tells me she quit her job. It‚Äôs a minimum wage job that she was doing for fun (she is 67 with full govt pension) and she didn‚Äôt like how the manager was being so she finally decided to quit. While telling us this story she even put her first up and said it was a ‚ÄúREVOLUTIONNNN!‚Äù It was really really weird. 


I called her the next day. She monologued some more but she was angrier. 
Rambling about my brothers wedding and a few other things. Then she asks me about my (paternal) grandmother. 

My grandmother and grandfather are both quite ill and have dementia. My dad and I recently had a meeting with the care staff about an end of life plan and what the next little bit will look like. 

Back to the call - my mom threw that back in my face. Asking what was going on with my grandmother because she was end of life. It‚Äôs hard to describe but the look on her face was one of judgement and hate. The tone of the question was quite harsh. The way she asked me that question it was like she didn‚Äôt believe my grandmother was actually going to be dying soon OR that i lied about it so I had an excuse for her not to come over or something? 

That was my last straw. I can tolerate a lot but I have to act on this. 

I have talked to a few friends. One tells me I need to be more patient and she is just really lonely. Another tells me this is fucked and to go low or no contact. 

I feel like I‚Äôm too close to the situation to look at it objectively and I‚Äôm not sure what my next step should be. 

Thoughts ? Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,1745759367.0,NarcissisticMothers,1,1.0,False

1k93jav,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k93jav,"One month on, the Mini M4 might be my favourite computer experience","Specs: 512GB Storage, 24GB RAM  
  
For context: I bought a Mini M4 back in March to replace a 7 year old and much hated Razer Laptop, perhaps the worse PC i've owned in spite its supposed processing prowess. Unfortunately, I couldn't have picked a worst time to considering building a new PC, so I decided to take a chance on the other side. 

So far, I have been nothing but impressed by the MacOS hardware and software ecosystem, from how easy it was to set-up, synchronise with my web apps and even iPhone information, and my daily production needs since. My use cases are a lot of Photoshop and Illustrator work for Content Creators, Small Businesses and Charities (Infographics, Thumbnails, Presentation images etc) and this thing makes it completely effortless. The video and audio work I do for my YouTube channel has also been as smooth a drink as my old PC on its good days. It's incredible after 20 years to see Adobe software work as expected. 

Perhaps the one sore spot if you can call it that has been gaming, and yet I've had a great time digging into Apple Arcade, the compatible apps, and using my Steam Deck through remote play as a means to offset that processing overhead (I'm actually glad it's got me to use this thing every day now). I'm considering looking at Crossover in future, only as I do coverage of smaller/indie titles that often don't get Mac/SteamOS compat versions.

But my most positive take away has been its portability. Ironically, my old laptop was on a constant life support of a cooling pad, external fans and multiple wires to function. Here, I unplug the few cables at the back, pop it in a hard case with a keyboard and mouse, and deploy it anywhere with a mains plug. The benefit of saving cash for an equivelent PC meant that I had a chunk left over to pair it with a nice single-cable graphics tablet, in this case the Wacom Movink which feels like a perfect partner for it. The fourth pic is it set up in my folks spare room, but I've also been using it on my flat's patio, hot desking at my office job, and even in coffee shops whilst travelling.

If I had to sum up the Mini M4 ethos; it'd be modularity. I've now gotten into the ritual of not having every device I own plugged into it at once, and instead removing and adding to it depending on the job to be done (headphone and a mic for streaming/podcasting, the tablet for art working, swapping out my drives when doing video production), and by doing so it actually gets me to focus my attention on that job.

I think the only thing I might consider to make it a complete setup is some kind of hardware capture solution for the deck, just so I can get a sharper image out of the device, but otherwise would highly reccomend the M4 to anyone either looking for a good first computer, something that can be the ""production"" machine alongside a dedicated ""gaming"" machine (either a deck or console), or a decent laptop replacement for those who don't like the laptop form factor.

I'm a 30F native Korean, soon to be free from work life and starting a new chapter.
I want to bring some fresh and meaningful energy into it ‚Äî by making new friends, especially non-Koreans living in Korea.

I've mainly worked in the education and IT industries in Korea.
While job hunting is important, I don't want to be stuck just worrying about it every day.

I'd love to connect with people from different cultures, just like I did during my working holiday in Australia. (There, I realized how much broader and more colorful the world feels when you meet people with different perspectives.)
Speaking English also brings out a more adventurous, confident side of me ‚Äî so I‚Äôd love to practice and grow through real conversations.

If we become friends, here‚Äôs what you can expect:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†A real Korean friend who can explain culture, society, and hidden spots locals love
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Chill, meaningful hangouts like exploring neighborhoods, food tours, pop-up events, and festivals
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Coffee lover's company (worked as a barista in Australia ‚òï) ‚Äî but not much into drinking or nightlife
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Healthy lifestyle buddy: into gym, biking, and overall good vibes

I'm not perfect in English ‚Äî actually, I needed some help from translation tools to write this ...  but I believe that's what makes it more fun!
If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs curious, open-minded, and looking for a genuine connection (not just small talk), I‚Äôd love to hear from you.

If you‚Äôre interested, feel free to leave a commet or dm pls (with a little intro about yourself:) -  no pressure at all! 
Thanks.

Honestly, what could be sweeter? Picture this: it‚Äôs a Tuesday morning, and you head to the break room only to be greeted by the tantalizing scent of freshly baked cinnamon rolls. Your colleagues? They're suddenly your best friends, and that dreadful 9 a.m. meeting isn't looking so bad anymore. You sit down with a warm roll and a cup of coffee, thinking, ‚ÄúYes, I have made the best life choices today.‚Äù 

Now, delivering these little bundles of joy on a subscription basis? Genius. It‚Äôs like gifting your employees or family a monthly reason to celebrate‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt need an excuse to enjoy chocolate chip cookies on a random Wednesday? You can create subscriptions tailored to everyone‚Äôs taste‚Äîmaybe a ‚ÄúMonday Motivation‚Äù pack featuring decadent brownies or a ‚ÄúFamily Fun Night‚Äù box loaded with cookie dough for the kids to bake together. Throw in gluten-free and vegan options, and suddenly, you‚Äôre the hero of every dietary dilemma.

And here‚Äôs where it gets even better: social media is your best friend. Let‚Äôs face it; people love a good food post, especially when it comes with a side of drool-worthy aesthetics. Snap some pictures of your mouthwatering creations and engage your audience with recipes and behind-the-scenes videos of the baking process. Imagine posting a quick reel of you actively mixing batter, flour flying everywhere, and then elegantly displaying the final product, which is basically cinnamon-laden perfection. Throw in some anecdotes about the inspiration behind each recipe‚Äîmaybe Grandma‚Äôs secret chocolate chip cookie recipe or your neighbor's cat who keeps trying to steal the cookies before they even get to the oven.

Don't forget to highlight your local ingredients and community connections! Partnering with local farmers for eggs or organic flour not only supports the community but adds a nice touch to your brand. You could weave in stories about the farmers themselves, showcasing how your business isn‚Äôt just about baking; it‚Äôs about cultivating relationships and building community. 

As you grow, consider involving your customers by hosting contests for new recipes or baking challenges that encourage them to engage online. ‚ÄúTag us in your best cookie creation!‚Äù could lead to a flood of content and, just as importantly, connection. Everyone loves to feel included in a community!

And here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîin your posts, don‚Äôt shy away from sharing your personal journey and how this endeavor aligns with your faith. Whether it‚Äôs a daily scripture that inspires your baking or a heartfelt story about service to others, let that authenticity shine through. It invites others to reflect on their journeys and creates a shared experience, which is the hallmark of community.

At the end of the day, you‚Äôre not just delivering baked goods; you‚Äôre delivering joy, connection, and a sprinkle of inspiration‚Äîone delicious bite at a time. Now that‚Äôs something to rise and shine about!",1,1745758979.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

From what I've read it's recommended to steam the milk in one pitcher and then (at least for beginners) transfer half of the milk in big pitcher for pouring. Afterwards the other half. 

So what I'm looking for is a good pitcher that the can use for pouring the latte art. I think what could for him is a spout not to narrow and not two round since he's not a complete beginner but still at the beginning of his coffee journey. 

Are there any recommendations?

1k93c2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k93c2p/my_27f_boyfriend_m29_doesnt_want_to_spend_money/,My (27/f) boyfriend (m/29) doesn't want to spend money on me anymore after a large financial raise,"Hello,

Boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 4 years. Currently live together and have for around 2 years. I have a son from a previous relationship, he is 6 years old. 

I have been working two jobs since I was 18 and out of my parents house, one I do 45-47/hours a week at, the other is a waitressing job so the hours vary but I am there every weekend. I work extremely hard and I am very busy between my two jobs and my son. I'm usually pretty burnt out. I have quite a few bills between rent, utilities, car, phone, daycare, food, my sons needs, a small credit card I pay, student loans. I am not in any substantial debt, I have around 4k in savings that I just built up in the last year due to bonuses at my job and working extra hours waiting tables. 

At the beginning of this year my boyfriend got a second job that pays him quite a bit of money and has substantially changed his financial situation. Before he was much more paycheck to paycheck at his singular full time job, could not build savings, had to budget, definitely was restricted on fun, etc. He would treat me though to dinner or some fast food, and on birthdays or holidays etc and never kicked a fuss about it. Sometimes he'd have to borrow from me, which I never minded at all and he would always pay me back timely, or I would foot the bill a bit more regularly for fun or fast food or something. We never made it into a thing, sometimes he would pay and sometimes I would. Nobody kept score, but I do feel like back before his second job I was paying for more as I just had more money due to working two jobs. 

With this second job he is in an entirely different situation though and I thought collectively this would be great for us as we have been talking seriously about saving for a house for next year and overall just improving our quality of life. But things have changed financially between us too now and I feel it's gone in a very negative direction. 

At first when the additional money started coming in he was buying me gifts, treating me to dinner, and even told me that if I wanted to step down to part time at my full job until I find something that makes me happy he would happily float us. I absolutely dread my full time job, it's very miserable and he knows this so him offering that to me really made me feel loved and understood. I am quite stubborn though and have always been one to handle things myself so I know better than to rely on somebody else for money and never made the move to part time. 

This generosity only last about 2-3 months, and he has very suddenly flipped up on me with money. He now is very much keeping score on who has paid for what, insists I ""got this one"" constantly while already at the restaurant or place, and I find I'm paying for more and more things than he is. Given how busy we both are we eat out entirely too much, but in the last 7 days alone I have paid for dinner three times amounting to nearly $100, our night out of fun we split the bill evenly, I bought him a bagel and coffee, brought him lunch to work. I also am the only person purchasing groceries. I pay more rent than he does because after we signed the lease he insisted that since my son is using a full bedroome I should cover the cost of that bedroom alone. We split the phone bill, wifi, and utilities. I pay for daycare myself obviously, and we both cover our own cars and insurances. 

He told me a few weeks ago he has enough money in savings right now that he could take 3 months off and still pay rent and his bills. He also only has a car payment and insurance, pays $550 in rent, and between the phone and wifi it's $75. He has far less bills than I do. It made me upset, as I've been feeling so much pressure from him to swipe my card for this or that and truthfully I'm suddenly at the point where I'm having to budget, where I have $100 left and have to survive the next 7 days before payday off that $100. If I say things like that to him he insists I have savings so I'm fine, and acts like my savings are totally okay to dip into, but he doesn't seem to feel the same way about his own savings. 

Last night we went out after work for some much needed fun, and after having paid for all those things listed above this week, I figured it was time for him to pay. He insisted at the restaurant again that I ""got this one"" which really upset me but I paid it after a small argument. We then moved to a bar for some drinks and darts in which he bet loser pays the tab, which I said no too as I literally just paid for the food! He ended up paying, but on the way home we got into a massive argument about it. The alcohol didn't help the situation, but he was insisting we sit down right now and figure out what is owed for the drinks at the bar. I didn't want to argue, stayed quiet and honestly felt so sad about the whole situation and wanted to go to bed. I ended up sleeping on the couch and sending him $80 additional for the night because I didnt want him to hold the money over my head. I'm at a breaking point with this, I have no idea how we ended up here. I'm looking for advice on how I can approach this topic with him? It seems very sensitive, I don't like the idea of splitting everything 50/50 as that just doesn't feel like a relationship to me. I was hoping with him getting this nice financial cushion that he would help me out more and start looking at us as a family unit so we can live more comfortably and achieve things like a house. Instead I feel like it's just divided us more than ever. 

Tldr boyfriend got a large raise, now is nickel and diming me for everything. I pay more bills than he does, and now pay for most our fun and food as well. Need advice on how to approach the topic as it seems sensitive and I don't like the idea of going 50/50 on everything. ",0,1745758600.0,relationship_advice,32,0.5,False

1k93a54,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/1k93a54/ai_art_is_not_a_vending_machine_it_is_a_coffee/,"AI Art is not a Vending Machine, it is a Coffee Machine","In the early days of this war, a common statement was along the lines of ‚ÄúAI is just a vending machine‚Äù. Thankfully, I don‚Äôt see this anymore. It seems that side has moved on to other arguments or actually learned something. But that is not the point of the post.

TL;DR ‚Äì When you make coffee; do you make it? Or do you use a machine to grind your beans, heat the water, and force the water through the beans? There are many ways to make coffee. I view AI the same. Sometimes I just want something quick (vending machine). Other times I want to dig into the weeds (custom flavor mix, foam top, maybe a sketch in the foam).

A few months(?) ago I was responding to someone while making coffee. The idea as been in my head a lot since then. I am going to talk this about in ‚Äútiers‚Äù, like iceberg videos about fandoms and stuff I see on YouTube. Since there have been so many food related posts, I thought I would add to this using a, imo, more appropriate comparison instead of pizza or a burger.

#Tier 0 ‚Äì Vending Machine Coffee

Starting with the most basic. You are stuck in an airport, trying to stay awake until your red-eye boards in 3 hours. You go to a vending machine and just get something black and strong (~~like your dick~~). 

In the same way, this is basic prompting for AI, (ex ‚Äúa brown dog‚Äù) You open up any of the free AIs out there and type in a few words and you get a picture. Probably not high quality, but you still get something you can use.

#Tier 1 ‚Äì The Best Part of Waking Up, Is Folgers in Your Cup 

You are at home, but are feeling lazy. You dump in some mass produced coffee into your Mr. Coffee basic pot. You might add sugar or creamer, but you cant mask the bitter black flavor of the coffee. 

With AI, you expand your prompts, get more detailed in what you want. ‚Äúa brown German Shepard puppy with green eyes, ready to go for a walk‚Äù. While the results are better, you still notice a lot of issues. Maybe the dog‚Äôs leg is in an impossible location. Maybe the dog has 2 tails.

#Tier 2 ‚Äì Flavored Coffee

You go out of your way to buy different flavors. Vanilla bean, hazelnut, cherry, etc. You grind the beans, measure (either by eye or with teaspoons) each flavor and experiment with mixes until you find a flavor that is the right balance between strong, black, and flavorful.

For AI, this is more complex prompts. ‚Äúa brown::2 German Shepard puppy with green::4 eyes, ready to go for a walk, in the style of Norman Rockwell, highly detailed, trending on deviant art, circular bokeh, f/4‚Äù. Additional weights, technical specifics, and references to other art.

This is where I currently reside. Both for coffee and AI art. I have only started dipping my toes into Krita AI and more advanced methods of working with AI. I know they exist and generally what happens, but I have no real experience. Please correct me as needed on the lower tiers.

#Tier 3 ‚Äì Cappuccino  

Now you get a PROPER coffee machine. One that can press grounds, foam milk, grind beans to your preferred size. You spend, what the outside observer things is, way too much time making a cup that you are going to consume in 20 minutes anyways. 

For AI, this would probably be Krita AI with in-painting, layering, etc. Like I said, I only just starting to learn Krita AI and I know I have only touched the potential the tools are capable of. But this gives you very precise control over exact locations in the picture.

#Tier 4 ‚Äì 100 cups of coffee.

You spend hours and hours mixing and experimenting with different coffee flavors. You make a spread sheet that tracks flavor profile vs ingredients and quantity of. People can ask you how to make some weird flavor, you might not know the exact ratios, but you can provide them a range from which they can experiment with.

For AI, this is where I would put ControlNet and LoRAs. You customize the shit out of it and get a complex workflow. You develop techniques to ensure character and environmental consistency across several angles.

Coffee, AI art, doesn‚Äôt matter. You are obsessed with the details (not that it is a bad thing).

#Tier 5 ‚Äì Bender‚Äôs coffee machine.

This comes from the famous (at least for ~40 year old millennials like me) Futurama quote ‚ÄúYeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park. With blackjack and hookers! In fact forget the park.‚Äù

You dig into the mechanics of a coffee machine. How does it control water temperature? How does it force the water through the grounds? How does a milk frother work? Once you learn that you start building your own. Tune the heating coil and reservoir so that water hits your desired temp with small margin of error.

For AI, you build your own, with furry porn and big titty goth gfs. The knowledge is out there. Anyone could make an AI from scratch. Might take a really long time cause you only have the one video card, but you can still do it. Experiment and learn the details of how AI does what it does.

---

I hope this was somewhat educational. I doubt it will change many minds, but eh...nothing else better to do while I have a sleeping cat on my lap.

I hope this provides those who don‚Äôt like AI a better comparison to a common activity.

In the end, I made the coffee. Yes, I used a coffee machine, grinder, and milk frother to do ‚Äúmost of the work‚Äù, but I still **made** it. I didn‚Äôt grow the beans, I didn‚Äôt mix the paint, I didn‚Äôt make the coffee machine, but it still required me, a sentient lifeform, to make the machine work.

1k936m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1k936m8/my_background_and_research/,My background and research,"Hello dear comrades, I call you comrades, because we're all here fighting the same battle, that of health and peace of mind.

I'm taking the liberty of sharing my story, my journey and my research, because I believe that all this may be useful to some in their quest for better days.

To set the scene :

I've had chronic gastritis for about 3 or 4 years now, and I've been to a dozen doctors. I've had dozens of blood tests and other examinations.

First of all, my gastritis didn't appear suddenly, it was a very strange and chaotic process. It started with episodes of bloating so intense that I couldn't breathe, almost to the point of calling the emergency room. To the point where I couldn't eat for 3 days because I felt like I had a pregnant belly. I had a few episodes like that over a few months. Doctor's conclusion: Irritable bowel syndrome (NO).

Anyway, then it calmed down. Important notes: during a certain period I was swallowing NSAIDs (nurofen) like candy (I was prone to severe migraines) and I had no idea of the harmful effects of NSAIDs...

A few months later, during the night (1H00), a severe pain occurred in my appendix, accompanied by hot flushes, loss of consciousness and bile vomiting. At that point, I called the emergency room, which told me very clearly: take a doliprane...

Ok. Nice. I went to see a doctor the next day, who found a right iliac fossa tusk, which suggested appendicitis, so I was sent for an ultrasound, which gave nothing, as there was too much gas and we couldn't see.

Following this, I began to experience severe vagal discomfort several times a day, with a huge loss of energy, great fatigue and weight loss.

I end up doing an abdominal scan: the appendix is fine, and so is everything else.

Small relief. But the pain is still there.

Then, the pain ‚Äúwent up‚Äù to the epigastric level, under the sternum.

This pain is like: a constant tugging, a heaviness on the flesh, a heaviness, constant.

Pain level about 5/10. Very present on an empty stomach, and calmed by food intake.

Then I had a ganglion in my neck that swelled (with pain) for 3 days. Theory: the pain in the appendix was probably the nearby ganglion that also swelled? Question: why do my lymph nodes react and swell?

All the blood tests (I've done a lot) are OK: the only downside is a vitamin b9 and vitamin D deficiency.

Thyroid: OK.

Urine: OK.

H. Pylori serology: Negative.

Diagnostic wandering is causing me stress.

In the meantime, I take a trip to Russia for 1 month. Strange thing: 1 week before the trip, all my symptoms stop, I'm 100% cured! For 3 weeks! Then, 1 week before returning home, the symptoms reappeared and I was back to square 0. I also realized how harmful NSAIDs are, and I stopped taking them altogether.

**Question: why did my symptoms disappear during this period?**

Consultation with 2 different osteopaths: no beneficial effect.

PPI: no effect.

New symptom: visceral hypersensitivity.

I'm starting to have panic attacks in cars, really intense vagal discomfort.

Examination: fibroscopy

\- chronic gastritis and also microulcers.

From then on, I tried EVERYTHING and documented myself enormously...(my god it could be a million things...)  
  
In short, I changed my situation in the meantime, I moved with my wife to a quiet place, a change of setting and work.  
  
Currently, I quit smoking (smoker for 15 years) for 2 weeks. I also quit coffee for 3 days (daily consumer) and I am also going through withdrawal lol, very difficult, headaches, fatigue...

After that, the symptoms stabilized and I'm at a pain level of 1 or 2/10, but it remains constant every day. Just masked by meals.

And that's where I am today.

In reality, when I said I was trying EVERYTHING, well I was trying really badly, I'd try for example 3 days and if I didn't see any benefit, I'd start again with a false conclusion.  
  
Just by removing these 2 stomach irritants, I can already feel an improvement.

I've also integrated cardiac coherence and meditation at least once a day.

I avoid acidic elements, although in general since it started, I can drink coffee, wine, beer, and eat pizza, it just doesn't work in my favor in the long run.

Important point:

In spite of this diagnostic wandering, the pain and the accumulated stress, gastritis taught me one thing: it taught me to have a better lifestyle, to eat more healthily, and to seek health and preserve and respect my body.

I'm also the kind of person who believes that there's a cause for everything, and that even gastritis doesn't just happen because it feels like it.

For me, the theory is that the trigger was the repeated use of NSAIDs, which greatly weakened my stomach, as well as a very sensitive and fragile psychological sphere.

If I haven't managed to cure myself so far, it's probably because I've never tried to follow the protocols CORRECTLY, I've never stopped drinking coffee, or even smoking.

**So here's my advice:**

First of all, get to know your psychological terrain. Is there anything in your life you can't digest? A trauma? Existential angst? Daily work-related stress? A toxic environment?

Then look for the physical causes (in relation to your symptoms):

\- H.pylori

\- abuse: coffee, cigarettes, bad food, soda, alcohol, etc...

\- histamine

\- DAO

\- SIBO

\- deficiency vitamine

\- food allergy or intolerance

\- vagus nerve problems

\- gall bladder

\- Biermer

\- thyroid gland

Evaluate all this with a strict protocol by trying various things and noting the results, for example, if you suspect a problem with histamine and DAO, do a strict anti-histamine diet for minimum 2 weeks, and note the results, if no improvement, move on to the next test, SIBO? Anti-SIBO diet 2 weeks, notes, results...

Never fall into certainty, and do tests. Do everything by elimination, step by step. Examination by examination.

Couple all this with an impeccable lifestyle:

\- no cigarettes

\- no alcohol

\- no acidic foods

\- no coffee

\- cardiac coherence

\- sport/walking

\- meditation or consult a psychologist

\- zinc-L-carnosine cure

\- special herbal tea for a fragile stomach

\- Mediterranean diet adapted to gastritis

\- regulate your deficiencies

If you want to heal, it's simple, you'll have to make concessions, you'll have to sacrifice your little pleasures.

I'm not cured yet, but I think I'm on the right track. It's not about correcting a small defect, but about radically changing my physical and mental hygiene. Gastritis can be a physical cause at first, but it's maintained by a psychological vicious cycle, through the gut-brain axis.

This message is simply to share my experience, what I've learned and what I've understood.

Don't hesitate to share your knowledge in the comments.

I've probably forgotten tons of stuff, but it's already a lot.

Identifying our stress triggers is a key step in the journey to manage and mitigate stress. But despite our best efforts, stress can sneakily manifest itself either physically or mentally. Instead of ignoring these symptoms, there are several ways that you can transform your approach to handling stress.

# 1.¬†¬†Deep Breathing

Deep breathing triggers a¬† physiological response in the body in the form of lowering blood pressure, steadying heart rate, elevating oxygen consumption, and tapering stress hormones. Cultivating an awareness of your breath can go a long way in how you cope with and manage stress. There are different types of breathing methods, and the one thing they share in common is that they are all positive destressors.

* Boxed Breathing ‚Äì also known as Square Breathing: this simple breathing technique involves you counting to four while you inhale, pausing before exhaling for another four counts, exhaling slowly for four counts, and pausing for another for counts before inhaling. Repeat until you feel centered. This technique is even suitable for children.
* Progressive Muscle Relaxation: this technique relies on you tensing up different muscle groups and relaxing them upon exhaling. For example, take a slow deep breath in. Tense the muscles in your feet. Then breathe out and release the tension from your feet. Repeat with other muscle groups.

Also, this technique can be easily incorporated into your daily life without interfering in your routine. Listen to music while working out, cooking, riding on your daily commute, and cleaning.

# 3.¬† Exercise

A regular workout routine is an effective method of managing and reducing stress.¬†[**Exercise**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/exercise-energy-and-mood-understanding-the-connection/)¬†improves mood and is beneficial for your physical health. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to shell out money on a gym membership or make drastic changes to your daily schedule. You can incorporate exercise into your cleaning routine, choose workout videos online and engage from the comfort of your own home, extend your dog walks by 20 minutes, or practice natural movement by gardening and spending time outdoors! Exercise shouldn‚Äôt be intimidating; movement is a natural part of life.

Sounds a bit odd, right? But these handheld gadgets are friendly for all ages. The viral fidget toys ‚Äì pop-its, spinners, cubes, and more ‚Äì are favored by kids and teens, but such toys have also helped adults in the workplace as a small outlet for stress or office restlessness. They also provide relief and calm to those who experience bouts of jumpiness and anxiety. Grab yourself a pop-it over a cup of coffee while at the office and give it a try.

# 5.¬† ¬†Improve Your Diet

What we eat and drink play a significant role in our¬†[**mental health**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/mental-health-emotional-coping-strategies-that-matter/). Ever hear that a happy tummy makes a happy baby? Well, that is quite true for adults as well. Improving gut health will improve your overall health and mood. Rather than dumping out your pantry and investing in a diet fad, consider making these changes first:

* Change your cooking oil: Do you know that conventional cooking oils such as corn, canola, and vegetable oils can disrupt your gut health? Olive oil is a good healthy fat, but it is not meant to be used in high heat. Reserve using olive oil for garnishes. A healthy cooking oil is avocado oil, which is now becoming more readily available at commercial supermarkets. Ghee, animal fats, and butter are also healthy substitutes for cooking oils.
* Take a Probiotic: Purchase a high-quality probiotic, preferably one that is food-based for better absorption. Probiotics improve gut health, thus improving your overall mood. There are probiotics formulated for women, men, and children.
* Cut the caffeine, or change the caffeine! Do you know that coffee is one of the most¬†[**processed food**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/ultra-processed-foods-how-does-your-diet-stack-up/)¬†items? Instead of purchasing coffee from a conventional brand, perhaps make the effort to buy it from a local cafe and educate yourself on its source and cultivation. If you want to ditch the caffeine altogether, you can incorporate calming herbs into your diet such as chamomile, anise seed, and mint.

# 6.¬†¬†Get Some Sleep

Lack of sleep affects not only your physical health, but sleeplessness can negatively impact mental health, too. Before tucking yourself into bed, make sure that your bedroom promotes a¬†[**good night‚Äôs sleep**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/foods-and-drinks-that-affect-your-sleep-at-night/)¬†by ensuring it is a dark, cool, and quiet setting for you to get optimum rest.

Stress affects us all in some way or another; however, if not managed appropriately, it can impact your mental and physical health. By incorporating these techniques into your lifestyle, your stress will be transformed into relaxation. Unwind with herbal tea, zone out to some relaxing music, and enjoy a nourishing meal. Treat your body and mind to some TLC, and start to move through your days with a little more ease.

Finally found a building I like, but the staff can be bitchy/annoying. 

One of the perks is that every morning they have free coffee & pastries in the lobby. I often go and eat one or two, maybe once or twice a week. 

Yesterday I took my usual two pastries up to my room instead of eating them in the lobby & got a mass text from my building manager that said to:

""Please be mindful, pastries are for everybody, please avoid taking large quantities to your room. If you would like service to your room, we'd be happy to discuss options.""

I'm just so confused by this on several levels, 1) I don't think they would have cared if I had eaten them in the lobby, 2) I think this means one of my high-maintenance neighbors snitched on me because who would notice?? & if so that makes me feel a bit fat-shamed because I know who saw me take 2 instead of 1, & 3) what does that last part even mean? Paying for an enormous quantity of croissants delivered to your unit?? lol

I'm new to ""luxury"" living & love the furnished/safety aspects but I'm not used to the culture I guess :) it's strange because the building projects that it's concierge & stuff but it's really hard to get ahold of people & they're really rude. I like that my neighbors are comfortable, LA-cushy (like do your laundry in your robe & slippers) but the unspoken rules confuse me. It's also not enough rent to justify the pettiness tbf

**What gives a memecoin value?**  


**Community, that‚Äôs it. There is no special sauce, special tactic or anything. The value of a meme coin is entirely dependant on the strength, reach and power of the community.**  
  
This is why I am so confident that Kendu will reach the tens of billions, on Twitter we routinely compete with coins that have a market cap in the hundreds of millions(whilst Kendu sits at 12 million), we also absolutely dominate everyone on Reddit and we are churning out quality IRL products like never before. Honestly, I cannot stress this enough, no coin past or present has ever reached the IRL heights that Kendu has achieved, we are also doing this when most holders will be in the red, imagine the sheer power when community members have a crazy amount of disposable income to create Kendu products. Kendu really is a multi billion dollar brand larping as a 12 million dollar memecoin.

From murals, to beer, to coffee, to masks we have it all:

* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks. I think it will be available on Steam. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals!

¬†Showcases of Kendu‚Äôs strength:

* Appearing front and centre of a Coinbase advert
* Achieving 50k Certik Votes, the only other coin to reach this was Pepe
* Keeping up with the best on Twitter, Instagram and Tiktok, whilst dominating on Reddit
* Incredibly active subreddit and telegram
* Now available on 3 chains(ETH, Sol and BASE)

**My Predictions for Kendu:**

Honestly I don't see a possibility where Kendu is below 10 billion dollars, when this cycle truly heats up and I think we see the billions in June(this is not financial advice and is strictly my opinion). Kendu is following the same path that Shib and Pepe followed back in their respective hay days, with Pepe even reaching a market cap of 10 billion outside of a bull run, this is insanity. So, with way more money and acknowledgement of what a memecoin can accomplish, Kendu stands to overcome previous records and reach new heights. Kendu is not at all different to pre pump Shib and Pepe, it is only a matter of time before Kendu‚Äôs market cap soars and enters the billions. With Kendu‚Äôs distribution getting better each day and our community strength holding strong in even the toughest of markets, it is clear where Kendu is gonna go. Always remember,¬†**Never bet against an obsessed community!**

1k930tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1k930tn/i_lost_the_one_because_i_wasnt_ready/,I lost The One because I wasn‚Äôt ready.,"When she (24F) was ready I (28M) wasn‚Äôt. When I was finally ready, she had decided to move on. 

I can‚Äôt sleep. I can‚Äôt eat. I can‚Äôt get out of bed or do anything. I am in pain, suffering, feeling I have lost the love of my life, feeling this regret will remain with me forever. I fear I will look back at my life at sixty, and know that I lost her: my one true love and my soulmate.

Before her, I was in a cycle of hookups and short-term relationships. I didn‚Äôt think of the future. I jumped from woman to woman, without care of the future. We dated throughout grad school and the summer after. With her, for the first time, I felt a vision of the future. I wanted a life with her. I didn‚Äôt believe in soul mates or ‚Äúthe one‚Äù until I met her. It felt like she and I were the same soul, not because of surface appearances but that deep presence that one feels with another person, because I felt her spirit and mine were one. Suddenly, I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. I wanted to wake up in the mornings with her. To end our day and fall asleep together. Each little thing felt imbued with love. Something as simple as a cup of coffee. A day spent inside together. A book shared. I wanted her to be the mother of my children. I wanted to be the father of her children.

But this didn‚Äôt match with my actions, my desires. Along with that came the past, my history of jumping between relationships, of sleeping with other women, and there was something in me that still couldn‚Äôt leave that behind. We had many many conversations. She was always there for me, and her love was the most true, the most honest, the most deep love. 

Our two year relationship was the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. I have never felt any love like ours. We felt like we lived the best life together. But I always ended up being the cause of some issue. We tried to make things work. But I wasn‚Äôt yet the person I needed to be for her. I didn‚Äôt feel like I deserved her. I knew that I needed to grow as a person. I hurt her many times because of this. I didn‚Äôt feel like a good person, I know I am not. But I have always wanted to be, I have tried my best to be. 

Seven months ago, I decided to let her go. Because I believed in our future and our love. If I wanted to build our future, I needed to risk losing her. I needed to step away and grow. To be the person she needed and then return to her, hoping she was still there. To become the person who could give her the love she deserves, to not hurt her anymore because there is no more painful thing I have felt than hurting her, the woman I love most.

After letting her go, I took time to reflect. We weren‚Äôt talking much. In the first three months, I admit. I went back to some old habits. I felt loss. But I went out, had some hookups. Felt like I needed to ‚Äúget it out of my system.‚Äù But it was all empty. I knew it was her that I loved. I decided I would be celibate. I‚Äôd take a break from it all and just try to overcome that desire which ruined my life. We would talk from time to time but I didn‚Äôt tell her what I was doing. We sent each other christmas gifts. Old fashioned letters. Then, she told me she was trying to move on. She loved me still fully but I had hurt her too deeply. I told her I really believed in us, that I hoped for us and our future. But maybe at this point my words felt cheap.

As more time came, pursuing this break from intimacy with others, and with our distance, I only felt my love for her grow. I knew our future was the only future I could live with. The only future I wanted. That there is nothing else I could want but us. I initiated contact. I wanted to begin building for us again, slowly, step by step. I wanted to be there to reassure her, I wanted to make sure I was there fully and wouldn‚Äôt hurt her. But she had moved on. In the same time I decided to be celibate, she decided to begin dating again. 

She is dating someone new now. And feels our relationship has too much baggage to return to. The pain I am feeling now, she has felt. And she felt I abandoned her. That I couldn‚Äôt be there for her in that darkness. She decided to move on despite our love which she admitted she still feels. But that future, that dream we once had, she no longer chooses. We met for the final time yesterday. When I looked at her, she looked the same. When I hugged her and felt her presence I felt love, intimacy, connection. But she is now open to other possibilities. She said our love was the happiest she has felt, but needs to a secure and stable relationship. After everything that happened, after I let her go, she felt she couldn‚Äôt risk jumping in to our relationship again. I understood her. But I also know my reasons and the truth and depth of my love. I cannot blame her. I only blame myself for the end of our relationship, which makes it hurt all the more. She told me to move on but I don‚Äôt want to. How can I move on from the woman I feel is my one true love? No woman I meet can ever replace her. No woman I meet could ever make me feel that love I felt with her. 

I am heartbroken. I feel regretful, sad, pained, angry, jealous, grief‚Ä¶ I want to keep hoping for our love. That one day, it could still happen. That one day, we really will make it. I really thought our love would make it through anything. I type this here because there is nobody else I can tell this to. I will say it anonymously and voice all my regret, and all my pain. And my fear that I lost the one great love of my life. The woman who is my soulmate. I lost her because I couldn‚Äôt love her as she needed. Couldn‚Äôt be there for her when she needed me. And Now I am just a shell of myself. A shadow  of regrets.

When I first started, I was using one of those little coffee spinner /milk frother things to blend everything up. I still added guar gum and xanthan gum and all that, but the texture just never really came out right. It would always be a little icy or kinda weird.

After I switched to using an immersion blender though, it was like night and day. Same ingredients, same stabilizers, literally the only thing I changed was using the immersion blender and now the ice cream comes out crazy smooth every time.

If you're still getting icy or crumbly textures, seriously try it. I wish I‚Äôd figured it out sooner lol.",44,1745757571.0,ninjacreami,21,0.97,False

Identifying our stress triggers is a key step in the journey to manage and mitigate stress. But despite our best efforts, stress can sneakily manifest itself either physically or mentally. Instead of ignoring these symptoms, there are several ways that you can transform your approach to handling stress.

# 1.¬†¬†Deep Breathing

Deep breathing triggers a¬† physiological response in the body in the form of lowering blood pressure, steadying heart rate, elevating oxygen consumption, and tapering stress hormones. Cultivating an awareness of your breath can go a long way in how you cope with and manage stress. There are different types of breathing methods, and the one thing they share in common is that they are all positive destressors.

* Boxed Breathing ‚Äì also known as Square Breathing: this simple breathing technique involves you counting to four while you inhale, pausing before exhaling for another four counts, exhaling slowly for four counts, and pausing for another for counts before inhaling. Repeat until you feel centered. This technique is even suitable for children.
* Progressive Muscle Relaxation: this technique relies on you tensing up different muscle groups and relaxing them upon exhaling. For example, take a slow deep breath in. Tense the muscles in your feet. Then breathe out and release the tension from your feet. Repeat with other muscle groups.
* Breath Focus: Find a comfortable place to begin this breathing technique. Close your eyes and pick an image along with a word/phrase to use as a focal point while breathing. Focus on the image while practicing this technique. Repeat the word or phrase when finished exhaling.

# 2.¬† Tune It Out

Selecting the right kind of¬†[**music**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/rhythm-in-life-cultivating-balance-through-music-and-dance/)¬†can work wonders when managing stress. Also, this technique can be easily incorporated into your daily life without interfering in your routine. Listen to music while working out, cooking, riding on your daily commute, and cleaning.

# 3.¬† Exercise

A regular workout routine is an effective method of managing and reducing stress.¬†[**Exercise**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/exercise-energy-and-mood-understanding-the-connection/)¬†improves mood and is beneficial for your physical health. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to shell out money on a gym membership or make drastic changes to your daily schedule. You can incorporate exercise into your cleaning routine, choose workout videos online and engage from the comfort of your own home, extend your dog walks by 20 minutes, or practice natural movement by gardening and spending time outdoors! Exercise shouldn‚Äôt be intimidating; movement is a natural part of life.

# 4.¬† Practice Mindful Fidgeting

https://preview.redd.it/kkeperqihdxe1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=7139f10da2093191241f595709f7b402bead88f2

Sounds a bit odd, right? But these handheld gadgets are friendly for all ages. The viral fidget toys ‚Äì pop-its, spinners, cubes, and more ‚Äì are favored by kids and teens, but such toys have also helped adults in the workplace as a small outlet for stress or office restlessness. They also provide relief and calm to those who experience bouts of jumpiness and anxiety. Grab yourself a pop-it over a cup of coffee while at the office and give it a try.

# 5.¬† ¬†Improve Your Diet

What we eat and drink play a significant role in our¬†[**mental health**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/mental-health-emotional-coping-strategies-that-matter/). Ever hear that a happy tummy makes a happy baby? Well, that is quite true for adults as well. Improving gut health will improve your overall health and mood. Rather than dumping out your pantry and investing in a diet fad, consider making these changes first:

* Change your cooking oil: Do you know that conventional cooking oils such as corn, canola, and vegetable oils can disrupt your gut health? Olive oil is a good healthy fat, but it is not meant to be used in high heat. Reserve using olive oil for garnishes. A healthy cooking oil is avocado oil, which is now becoming more readily available at commercial supermarkets. Ghee, animal fats, and butter are also healthy substitutes for cooking oils.
* Take a Probiotic: Purchase a high-quality probiotic, preferably one that is food-based for better absorption. Probiotics improve gut health, thus improving your overall mood. There are probiotics formulated for women, men, and children.
* Cut the caffeine, or change the caffeine! Do you know that coffee is one of the most¬†[**processed food**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/ultra-processed-foods-how-does-your-diet-stack-up/)¬†items? Instead of purchasing coffee from a conventional brand, perhaps make the effort to buy it from a local cafe and educate yourself on its source and cultivation. If you want to ditch the caffeine altogether, you can incorporate calming herbs into your diet such as chamomile, anise seed, and mint.

# 6.¬†¬†Get Some Sleep

Lack of sleep affects not only your physical health, but sleeplessness can negatively impact mental health, too. Before tucking yourself into bed, make sure that your bedroom promotes a¬†[**good night‚Äôs sleep**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/foods-and-drinks-that-affect-your-sleep-at-night/)¬†by ensuring it is a dark, cool, and quiet setting for you to get optimum rest.

Stress affects us all in some way or another; however, if not managed appropriately, it can impact your mental and physical health. By incorporating these techniques into your lifestyle, your stress will be transformed into relaxation. Unwind with herbal tea, zone out to some relaxing music, and enjoy a nourishing meal. Treat your body and mind to some TLC, and start to move through your days with a little more ease.

**Chloe:** Star Sign: Aquarius Occupation: Student/ Major: Journalism Year: Freshman GPA: 4.0 Height: 165 cm.

**Lilian**: Star Sign: Gemini Occupation: Student/ Major: Design Year: Freshman GPA: 3.5 Height: 160 cm.

**Anne:** Height: 170 cm

She also answered my questions via email.

Q: *In my poly route which Jaynie went to Paris with Lilian, I didn't get Chloe's coffee date scene in ep. 9. Do we have to choose to spend time with either Lilian or Chloe in this chapter?*

A: Yeah, I believe a combo of factors went into that decision-making process there, sorry! Part of it is that I was having a hard time keeping time and continuity aligned throughout the branches, and I was thinking about it, and I think it has something to do with how I conceive of my branching as a 3D object that moves through space/time, which are a series of fixed block-style events. In other words, how my mind conceives of it is: At 11:22 am on a Saturday, where is Jaynie? Then, I can write all the parallel branches within that ""block."" I know that sounds probably¬† kind of... wishy-washy and woo-woo, but I think that I could definitely build my strengths out so that can do mis-aligned time frames and maintain continuity. I was wondering if I'd try to build more toward that in my next story via having variables that track days and/or day/night schedules.

That said, I knew there would be some folx who'd find themselves in an either/or situation, so anyone who goes to Paris with Lilian will have another opportunity to hop aboard the courtroom branches in order to support Chloe throughout that fraught process.

**About Chloe's reaction towards Jaynie's law belief:** Chloe strongly prefers the Lawful stats, and this will lead to problems between an Outlaw MC and Chloe. There's going to be opportunities to course-adjust later for the people who aren't playing a ton of slots, and it might be possible for people to ""thread the needle"" between all these routes by periodically changing their minds, haha.

**More about Anne:** She's definitely not an LI. I only have a few episodes left to write at this point, and it's going to be¬†a struggle to wrap it all up as it is!¬† I'm glad that so many people like her, and she will feature in a few more episodes.",10,1745757562.0,RomanceClubDiscussion,0,0.92,False
1k930f6,https://i.redd.it/7hpj9rrjfdxe1.jpeg,All such challenges are timeless...,"Good morning! Today's post is another story with a recipe...It‚Äôs 4AM and I‚Äôm standing on a dock. Harborside lights illuminate the crystal-clear water, where I can see small bait fish flit about, while a crab scuttles to hide in the shadows.  At that moment, I am less interested in marine life than I am the depth of the water.  I know we need at least a half-tide to make it over the creeping sandbars that continually infiltrate the channel.  Many a morning was spent peering into the depths, awaiting the moment when we could depart. 

My Dad was a commercial sea scallop fisherman.  His boat was a thirty-foot long wooden dragger, built in 1931.  She was a modest working vessel, with the well-worn, slightly dingy look that typified most fishing boats.  A symphony of aromas accompanied her wherever she went: a pungent mixture of old fish, diesel exhaust, and paint.  Her pilot house was outfitted with a compass, fathometer, VHF radio, and wind-up clock.  Down below and forward, an old-fashioned cast iron stove, fold-down table/pantry, and a berth made for a cozy little cabin.  A large coffee can served as the head (toilet) for anyone who did not wish to make their deposit over the gun‚Äôale.

I accompanied Dad on these outings whenever possible.  As a kid raised in a semi-famous ‚ÄúSea Captain Town‚Äù, it was almost impossible to avoid at least some familiarity with the nautical world, but my childhood was well-steeped in it.  And I was hooked from the start.  I loved everything to do with boats and being on the water.  Dad usually fished alone unless accompanied by a family member or friend, so when I was first invited to go out scalloping at age eight (after pleading to be allowed to go for some time), I was thrilled.  The hours were long, but as a ‚Äúday boat‚Äù that returned to harbor by nightfall, the trips were less onerous than those of bigger off-shore boats.

We left as soon as the tide permitted and I made bacon and eggs for our breakfast while we steamed to the grounds.  The stove was probably intended to be fueled with wood, but as I recall, we most often used cans of ethanol gel for cooking.  The stovetop had a clamp system called fiddles that kept pots and pans from suddenly levitating or taking flight across the cabin while we were underway.  The fiddles also allowed the cook to use both hands when tending food, and sometimes, to brace against the carnival ride-like motion of the boat. Later, fortified by a hearty breakfast and still plunging along, we washed the dishes.  The plates and silverware were washed in the shucking box, but most of our dinnerware had holes in it, so the skillet, ironstone coffee mugs, and spatula had a line run through the holes and after being tied-off, were thrown over the side to be scrubbed as we forged ahead to our destination. Following a period of being subjected to a saltwater-and-sand scouring, we hauled back on the rope and the sparkling-clean items were dried and stowed. 

Sea scalloping involves towing a drag across the ocean floor in strategic areas.  With luck, you will have found a few good scallop beds, and if you‚Äôre careful not to overfish them, you can alternate between these beds indefinitely.  After the drag comes up, its contents are dumped onto the deck and the pile is culled for scallops, which are then shucked while the drag is returned to the water.  This cycle of drag down/drag up goes on all day, but we must stop in time to steam back to the harbor to catch the evening tide. 

Days worked on the water are unlike any day on land.  It is almost as though you have been transported to another world.  Time moves at its own speed, measured by the cadence of the waves, and the duration of each tow along the seafloor.  On pleasant days, the breeze whispers softly in rigging and the moist salt air refreshes the skin.  That said, there were many bitter cold days when the biting wind caused what we called ‚Äúwind burn‚Äù and I envied my father his beard!

I was scalloping with Dad on a winter‚Äôs day when the snow began to fall fast and thick.  The seas were relatively calm, but it was quite cold.  As mentioned before, Dad had a full beard, and it was coated with frost, his mustache edged with icicles.  The snow stuck to us as we worked, until we more closely resembled a pair of Yetis than a couple of humans.  I may have been twelve or thirteen years old at the time, but I still vividly recall how thoroughly chilled I was, especially considering it was difficult to do that kind of work while wearing gloves.  I knew Dad had to be cold as well.

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I said, having had an epiphany, ‚ÄúDo you want a cup of hot chocolate?‚Äù He answered with a decisive affirmative, so I was down below in a flash to boil water.  These days, when I make hot chocolate, I cook it on the stovetop from individual ingredients. (Recipe below.)  This was just instant cocoa, but the ironstone mugs made wonderful hand-warmers and it felt so luxurious to sip the piping-hot beverage as I thawed my fingers. 

There‚Äôs a great sense of camaraderie that comes from standing together on a gently heaving deck, listening to the engine labor as the boat leads the drag on yet another pass, silently enjoying a simple cup of cocoa.  The drag would be hauled up shortly, but this few minutes‚Äô respite was priceless as snow swirled around us; no one else was in sight ‚Äì we were just two people on a little boat as it plowed across a vast expanse of green water.

Some part of me will always be a fisherman‚Äôs daughter: the kid who drew pictures of fishing boats in art class, while the other kids drew horses, cars, and houses; the kid who went to school with dried scallop guts and blood on my oil skins (raincoat).I haven‚Äôt worked in the fishing industry for many years now, but it was an important part of my upbringing and it made my living for some decades. I am past the point in life where I would want to return to that occupation, but I still wax nostalgic on occasion for the smell of the ocean and freedom of riding the waves.  I hope I have passed on this affinity to my children, who were exposed the ocean and boats literally from the time they were babies. 

It was my fate that I should be drawn to two very different worlds: the call of the sea and the grounding effect of living a terrestrial life.  And I harbor a deep and abiding love for both.

Commercial fishing and working in boat yards have also influenced my writing, especially as it pertains to my current book series.  Not only because I worked almost exclusively with men, but because of the insights gained from working with men who labored in one of the most physical and dangerous occupations known.  Surely, our early ancestors would have shared at least some of their views on the pursuit of prey (whether fish, fowl, or mammal) and the risks involved with the less-than certain lifestyle and empathized with the discomforts that come with exposure to the elements, no matter what form they may take.  All such challenges are timeless.

I hope all is well in your corner of the world! üåû

1k9306p,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1k9306p/when_will_i_be_able_to_sleep_through_the_night/,When will I be able to sleep through the night?,"TLDR since I enjoy writing about my experiences: Sleep was getting to be a serious problem, even with just one cup in the morning, so I started weening myself off. I think it was 2 days ago when I measured a level soup spoon of coffee and the rest Teechino. Yesterday I had one cup of black tea in the AM and a headache in the late AM that stopped when I went to the gym. I still slept like crap last night, but am continuing with the weening plan. I'm drinking matcha now for 2 or 3 days and shouldn't have any issue cutting it off completely. I could go to white tea if I really needed to be gentle. I guess I just thought I'd be sleeping better as soon as I started cutting down the amount of coffee, but I'd be curious to hear the experiences of others. For the last week, I've been using a sleep powder with magnesium, glycine, 5-HTP & L-Theanine. Last night I did some pranayama. I've been getting to sleep okay, but wake up after a couple hours and feel like I drift in and out of a shallow sleep for the rest of the night, moving around a lot. Full disclosure, I've also stopped THC gummies about 10 days ago that I was using as a sleep crutch but made me feel weird the next day. They also weren't that effective for sleep. So, does it take time to recover sleep? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

I'm 34 and have pretty much struggles with dependency on some substance my whole life. I was exposed to alcohol when I was 12, and coffee around the same time via someone's mom from my boy scout troop. Soon enough, cannabis and tobacco were added. I even ended up in a religious/spiritual cult for 9 years, where we didn't use substances, but caffeine/chocolate were generally considered acceptable. Without the other substances, I was leaning more into food, for what seems like a poor coping mechanism for dealing with emotional turmoil. 

So it would appear that I have an addictive personality, and I don't seem to be able to use any substance in moderation. I have been a little bingey with alcohol recently (not every night) and have been off for about 10 days as well. It would appear that I'm quitting all substances at once, which I gather is not typically recommended, but it feels necessary. If I try to quit just one thing, it feels a little like trying to put underwear on an octopus, a tentacle just slips out and grabs me again. 

Emotionally, I actually feel pretty well. I've been focusing more on relationships and have been engaging in somatic practices like T.R.E. that are designed to heal trauma at the level of the nervous system. It's brought me some deep releases which resulted in crying heavier than I can ever remember. It looks like without the substances, I'm finally able to feel what's really going on inside me. 

I'm between careers at the moment and am 90% sure I don't want to go back to plumbing. I'm going to take some time to figure out a path forward, but it would be amazing if I could sleep through the whole night. It's frustrating because I feel like I'm putting in a lot of work to change and learn how to relax more, but sleep is still such a struggle most of the time. I'd really love to know if anyone can relate with my experience and would greatly appreciate any insight you may be able to share. Thank you!",1,1745757524.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Today was supposed to be the day. So we drove into town, but unfortunately, we completely forgot that today was the last day of the Easter holidays. 
Accordingly, it was very busy and almost impossible to find a parking space. On top of that, there's a zoo right next to the botanical garden, and there were *many* families with children in town. 
After driving around for 20 minutes, we finally found a parking space. Actually, there were two parking spaces, but someone had parked their car so badly that only one car could park next to them. One family still tried to park their car next to us. The mother got out with her two children to guide the father into the parking space. But you could see that the father would never have been able to open the car door if he had parked there. The mother then said there was no point in looking any further. They drove through the city for almost an hour looking for a parking space and that they would now have to go back home and visit the zoo another day.
The children were disappointed, and the youngest looked like he was about to cry. 
Then it hit me. I quietly asked my father if we wanted to give up our parking space to the family. My father agreed. He even handed the woman the parking ticket he had paid, and then we drove back home. We had coffee and cake on the way. 
When I got home and was browsing through Reddit, one of my internet friends messaged me and asked how the trip to the botanical garden went. I told him the story, and he was outraged. As a true Redditor, I had violated the greatest commandment:
 ""You don't owe anyone anything, especially not a child.""
The friend snitched to my other online friends. Some then started making fun of me, calling me child-friendly and saying it wasn't too late for me to find a partner and have children when I love them so much. They also said they wouldn't give me a birthday present this year, but would donate money to child protection organizations in my name. Other friends were less nice to me, calling me a disgrace and telling me to delete my Reddit account before they blocked me.
I know I screwed up. But am I really the asshole? This was my first offense, and I swear I'm not really into children. Most of the time I'm awkward with kids.

Do I really have to delete my account now?

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality and effectiveness of a coffee cup sleeve depend on several key features.

**Material Composition:** This is a fundamental factor that dictates both the insulation properties and environmental impact of the sleeve.

Materials range from traditional corrugated cardboard to recycled paper and even cloth. Corrugated cardboard offers excellent insulation and is readily available, making it a common choice. Recycled paper options prioritize sustainability, reducing waste and minimizing environmental impact. Cloth sleeves, often reusable, offer a premium feel and can be washed, making them a durable and eco-conscious option. The choice of material will influence not only the sleeve's performance but also its price point and environmental footprint.

**Insulation Performance:** The primary purpose of a coffee cup sleeve is to insulate the hand from the heat of the beverage.

Effective insulation prevents burns and allows the user to comfortably hold the cup for an extended period. Insulation performance is typically measured by the sleeve's thickness and the material's thermal conductivity. Thicker sleeves with lower thermal conductivity provide better insulation. Some sleeves incorporate air pockets or specialized coatings to further enhance their insulating capabilities. The ideal insulation level depends on the typical temperature of the beverages being served.

**Grip and Stability:** A good coffee cup sleeve should provide a secure grip, preventing the cup from slipping out of the user's hand.

This is especially important when walking or carrying multiple items. The sleeve's surface texture and design play a crucial role in determining its grip and stability. Some sleeves feature textured surfaces, such as embossed patterns or non-slip coatings, to enhance grip. Others utilize a snug fit around the cup to minimize movement and slippage. A stable sleeve contributes significantly to a positive and safe coffee-drinking experience.

**Durability and Reusability:** The sleeve's ability to withstand wear and tear, and its potential for reuse, are important considerations, particularly for environmentally conscious consumers.

Durable sleeves can withstand repeated use without tearing or losing their shape. Reusable sleeves, often made from cloth or silicone, can be washed and reused multiple times, reducing waste. The choice between disposable and reusable options depends on individual preferences and priorities. Disposable sleeves are convenient for single-use applications, while reusable sleeves offer long-term cost savings and environmental benefits.

**Design and Aesthetics:** While functionality is paramount, the sleeve's design and aesthetics can also contribute to the overall coffee-drinking experience.

A visually appealing sleeve can enhance the perceived value of the beverage and reflect the brand's identity. Sleeves are available in a wide range of colors, patterns, and designs, allowing businesses to customize them with their logo or branding. Some sleeves even incorporate creative features, such as interactive elements or personalized messages. The design should complement the cup and enhance the overall presentation of the beverage.

 ## Core Benefits

Coffee cup sleeves offer several key benefits that enhance the coffee-drinking experience for both consumers and businesses.

**Enhanced Comfort and Safety:** The primary benefit of a coffee cup sleeve is protecting hands from burns caused by hot beverages. By providing a layer of insulation, the sleeve allows users to comfortably hold the cup without discomfort. This is especially important for hot drinks like coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. The sleeve also prevents condensation from making the cup slippery, reducing the risk of spills and accidents.

**Improved Grip and Stability:** A good coffee cup sleeve enhances grip and stability, making it easier to hold the cup securely. This is particularly beneficial when walking or carrying multiple items. The sleeve's texture and snug fit around the cup prevent slippage, providing a more confident and secure hold. This reduces the likelihood of spills and ensures a more enjoyable coffee-drinking experience.

**Brand Enhancement and Marketing Opportunity:** Coffee cup sleeves offer a valuable branding and marketing opportunity for businesses. They can be customized with logos, slogans, and other branding elements, turning them into miniature billboards. This reinforces brand recognition and creates a positive impression on customers. A well-designed sleeve can also enhance the perceived value of the beverage and contribute to a more premium brand image.

**Environmental Responsibility:** Opting for eco-friendly coffee cup sleeves demonstrates a commitment to environmental responsibility. Sleeves made from recycled materials or reusable materials help reduce waste and minimize environmental impact. This appeals to environmentally conscious consumers and enhances the brand's reputation for sustainability. By choosing eco-friendly options, businesses can contribute to a more sustainable future.

 ## FAQs Section

**What types of materials are commonly used for coffee cup sleeves?**
Common materials include corrugated cardboard, recycled paper, and cloth. Corrugated cardboard is widely used for its insulation properties, while recycled paper options prioritize sustainability. Cloth sleeves offer a reusable and premium option. The best material depends on the desired balance between cost, performance, and environmental impact.

**Are coffee cup sleeves recyclable?**
The recyclability of coffee cup sleeves depends on the material and local recycling guidelines. Corrugated cardboard sleeves are often recyclable, while some coated paper sleeves may not be. Reusable cloth sleeves are the most environmentally friendly option, as they can be washed and reused multiple times. It's important to check with local recycling facilities to determine which types of sleeves are accepted.

**Can I customize coffee cup sleeves with my company's logo?**
Yes, many suppliers offer customization options for coffee cup sleeves. This allows businesses to print their logo, slogans, or other branding elements on the sleeves. Customized sleeves enhance brand recognition and create a positive impression on customers. The customization process typically involves submitting artwork to the supplier and selecting the desired printing method.

Kylea quickly archived/hid/deleted post #5 I had dubbed Treat Yo Self.  One post hit 1k reactions (image 7), one hit 2k reactions (image 10), only 6 posts had more than 100 comments, and she gained approx. 41 followers pushing her over the 153k mark again (image 17). 

You Grow Girl is not accurately reporting her serving sizes.  However, let's ignore her delulu measurements for a sec and tally her Saturday WW points:

? WW point AM coffee at home;
5WW point breakfast;
? WW point Scooters blended coffee;
5 WW point snack plate lunch;
6 WW point taco salad;
4 WW point Pineapple Bliss TREAT;
? WW points on all the other coffee beverages & snacks she didn't show you

EQUALS Kylea has nothing to roll over into her weeklies bank.  I suspect she's been using all her 23 daily points and then tapping into her weeklies, which is why she needed bigger jeans and is no longer getting 40+ WW point weekly treats. üòâ 

IMO, you are witnessing her spiral and struggle to control her addictions.  Birdie is being left at home while she manically shops, doing anything to avoid spending time with Gym Bro Joe.

Everyone seems to be talking about how they boost energy, help with weight management, and support the tiny powerhouses inside our cells‚Äîsomething called mitochondrial health. MITOLYN has a whopping 4.8-star rating from more than 86,000 people, so I knew I had to see what all the fuss was about. I decided to give it a real test and used MITOLYN for a whole year‚Äî365 days. Here‚Äôs my honest, no-nonsense review after living with it every single day.

### [‚úÖ Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://4bdf3kthv1v33p4jsfs7cf3n5c.hop.clickbank.net)

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before I started using MITOLYN, I was honestly struggling. Every day felt like a repeat of the one before: I was tired before the day even started, my focus wasn‚Äôt great, and I just didn‚Äôt feel like myself. I tried everything you could imagine‚Äîdrinking more coffee, reading up on energy hacks, and even those ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù supplements that influencers never stop talking about. But nothing really stuck. Most things gave me a tiny boost, then left me feeling worse than before.

I was frustrated, and honestly, I was starting to lose hope that anything could help me feel more energetic and focused. That‚Äôs when I came across MITOLYN. The reviews were glowing, but I was still a bit skeptical. Still, I figured, why not? I was ready for a change.

# First Impressions Matter ‚Äì And MITOLYN Nails It

When my box of MITOLYN arrived, I could tell right away this was something different. The packaging looked super sleek and modern, like something you‚Äôd find in a fancy store. It didn‚Äôt look cheap or thrown together‚Äîit felt like a product that someone cared about.

Opening it up, the instructions were clear and simple. I didn‚Äôt have to guess how much to take or when to use it. Everything was explained in plain language, which made me feel confident about starting. The capsules themselves didn‚Äôt taste weird or leave any funny aftertaste, which was a big plus!

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say I started feeling a difference within the first week. I woke up with more pep in my step, and I didn‚Äôt need to reach for extra cups of coffee just to make it through the morning. My mind felt less foggy, and I was getting more done at school and at work.

A few weeks in, even my skin started to look healthier. I didn‚Äôt expect that at all! People would ask if I was sleeping more or if I changed my diet, but honestly, MITOLYN was the only new thing in my routine.

After a month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt had one of those midday crashes that used to leave me dragging myself through the afternoon. I had more energy for family time, hobbies, and even started taking short walks in the evenings‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt done in years.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are tons of supplements out there, so why did MITOLYN work so well for me? Here‚Äôs what I noticed:

- **Top-Notch Ingredients**  
  MITOLYN doesn‚Äôt mess around with cheap stuff. Every capsule is packed with high-quality, natural ingredients. No weird chemicals or fillers‚Äîjust what your body actually needs.

- **Noticeable Changes**  
  This isn‚Äôt one of those products where you have to wonder if it‚Äôs working. The changes were real and easy to see‚Äîmore energy, better mood, and even clearer skin.

- **Safe and Gentle**  
  I didn‚Äôt have any side effects. No jitters, no upset stomach, nothing weird. I just felt better, plain and simple.

- **Great Value**  
  Some supplements cost a fortune and do nothing. MITOLYN isn‚Äôt the cheapest, but when you see how well it works, it actually saves you money. I stopped buying other energy drinks and random vitamins because I just didn‚Äôt need them anymore.

- **Trusted by Others**  
  When I checked online, I found thousands of people just like me sharing their stories. MITOLYN has a whole community of happy users, and that made me feel even better about my choice.

# People Around Me Noticed

This was honestly one of the coolest parts! My friends and family kept asking what I was doing differently. They noticed I wasn‚Äôt as tired and had more energy for fun stuff. Even my coworkers commented that I seemed happier and more focused.

When I told them about MITOLYN, a few of them decided to try it too. Soon, they were coming back to me with the same stories‚Äîfeeling better, getting more done, and just enjoying life more.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had one small issue with my order (the delivery took longer than expected because of a shipping mix-up). I reached out to MITOLYN‚Äôs customer support and, wow, they responded so fast! They were super friendly and made me feel like my problem really mattered to them. They even followed up to make sure everything got sorted out, which almost never happens with big companies these days.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Without a doubt, yes! I‚Äôve already told my family, friends, and even a few coworkers about MITOLYN. I only recommend things that truly work, and this is at the top of my list now. If you‚Äôre feeling tired all the time, or just want to feel better and get more out of your day, MITOLYN is honestly worth a try.

# Final Thoughts ‚Äì Worth Every Penny

Looking back over the year, I‚Äôm so glad I decided to give MITOLYN a shot. It‚Äôs not just a supplement‚Äîit‚Äôs been a game changer for my energy, my focus, and even my confidence. I feel more like myself than I have in years, and my days are just better.

# What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a supplement that‚Äôs made to help you feel better, have more energy, and maybe even lose a little weight. The bottle I received looked fancy and made me feel like I was trying something special. According to the company, MITOLYN is packed with natural ingredients that are supposed to help your body in lots of ways. It claims to speed up your metabolism, clear your mind, and help you stay active. Basically, MITOLYN is like a daily boost for your body and brain‚Äîall in one little pill!

# Why I Decided to Try MITOLYN

I‚Äôve always wanted to find something that could help me get out of my rut. I‚Äôm not a gym rat, and I don‚Äôt have hours to spend preparing healthy meals every day. I‚Äôve tried lots of different pills and powders, but nothing really stuck. What caught my eye about MITOLYN was how many people said it helped them feel better without making huge changes to their routine. It wasn‚Äôt just about weight loss‚Äîpeople were talking about having more energy, clearer thinking, and just feeling happier. After reading all those stories, I decided to give it a shot. I thought, ‚ÄúIf it works for them, maybe it‚Äôll work for me, too!‚Äù

# My 30-Day Experience with MITOLYN

I promised myself I‚Äôd take MITOLYN every day for a month and keep track of what I noticed. I wanted to be honest about the good and the bad, so I paid close attention to how I felt each week.

# Week 1: The Initial Impact

The first week, I started my mornings with one MITOLYN capsule and a big glass of water, just like the label said. At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much different. But after a couple of days, I realized I wasn‚Äôt dragging myself out of bed as much. I felt a bit more awake and ready to start the day. My stomach felt a little calmer, too‚ÄîI usually get bloated after meals, but that feeling started to go away. I didn‚Äôt see any big changes yet, but I felt hopeful for what was to come.

# Week 2: Seeing the First Signs of Change

By the second week, things started to get interesting. My energy lasted longer‚Äîno more mid-afternoon crashes where I‚Äôd want to curl up and nap. I even had the motivation to take a short walk after dinner instead of collapsing on the couch. I also noticed that I wasn‚Äôt snacking as much. Normally, I‚Äôd be reaching for chips or cookies, but I was feeling fuller and didn‚Äôt crave junk food as much. It felt like MITOLYN was giving me a gentle push in the right direction.

# Week 3: Feeling More Confident

Week three rolled around, and I could see and feel the difference. My clothes fit a little looser, and I actually looked forward to getting dressed in the morning. My mind felt less foggy, and I could focus better on my schoolwork and chores. Even my friends and family started to notice I was in a better mood. I wasn‚Äôt as tired in the evening, which meant I could enjoy some fun time with my family instead of just staring at the TV.

# Week 4: The Final Transformation

By the last week, I was honestly impressed. I had lost a few pounds without really trying, my skin looked brighter, and I just felt happier overall. I woke up ready to go, and I didn‚Äôt need extra coffee to keep moving. I felt like the best version of myself. Even though I had doubts at first, MITOLYN proved me wrong. It didn‚Äôt just give me energy‚Äîit made me feel good about myself, inside and out.

# The Benefits I Noticed with MITOLYN

Here are some of the things that stood out to me after using MITOLYN for a month:

- **Steady Energy:** I felt awake and alert from morning until bedtime, without feeling jittery or anxious.
- **Better Digestion:** My stomach was calmer, with way less bloating and discomfort after eating.
- **Sharper Focus:** I could think more clearly and finish my tasks faster‚Äîno more brain fog!
- **Fewer Cravings:** I didn‚Äôt have the urge to snack on unhealthy foods all the time.
- **Improved Mood:** I felt happier, more confident, and just more ‚Äúme.‚Äù
- **Weight Loss:** I lost a few pounds without changing much else in my routine.
- **Healthy Habits:** MITOLYN made it easier to make better choices, like going for walks and drinking more water.

# Why MITOLYN Might Be the Right Supplement for You

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling tired, or if you want to start living a healthier life without making huge changes, MITOLYN could be a good fit. It‚Äôs made from natural ingredients, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about weird chemicals. Plus, it doesn‚Äôt just focus on one thing‚Äîit helps your mind, your energy, and your body all at once. I liked that I didn‚Äôt have to follow a strict diet or workout plan. MITOLYN fit into my life, not the other way around. If you want a simple way to feel better every day, MITOLYN might be just what you need.

# Final Thoughts

It‚Äôs not some magic pill, but it did help me feel more energetic, happier, and healthier without any weird side effects. I feel more confident and ready to take on whatever comes my way.

# My Journey Before MITOLYN

Let me start by telling you a little about myself. I‚Äôm 42, a parent of two, and I run a small business from home. For years, I felt like I was running on empty. My mornings started with groggy eyes and a heavy head, and I‚Äôd drag myself through the day fueled by too much coffee and not enough real energy. I struggled with constant tiredness, trouble focusing, and a stubborn belly that wouldn‚Äôt shrink no matter how many diets or workouts I tried. Sometimes, I‚Äôd even forget simple things, like where I put my keys or what I was supposed to do next.

I tried all sorts of things: energy drinks, vitamins, protein shakes, even meditation apps. Some things helped for a day or two, but nothing really fixed the problem. I was tired of quick fixes and wanted something that would help me feel like myself again‚Äînot just for a day, but for good.

# What Is MITOLYN, Really?

If you‚Äôre like me, you might wonder, ‚ÄúWhat even is MITOLYN?‚Äù In the simplest words, MITOLYN is a supplement that‚Äôs all about helping the tiny engines inside your body‚Äôs cells‚Äîcalled mitochondria‚Äîwork better. Mitochondria are like little power plants in every cell, turning food and oxygen into the energy you need to live, think, and move.

MITOLYN‚Äôs formula is built to recharge these engines, so you get more natural energy, better focus, and even help with things like weight loss and sleep. The ingredients list has stuff like CoQ10, PQQ, and other hard-to-pronounce but important nutrients, along with natural herbs that help your body handle stress. They all work together, which is why people call it a ‚Äúmitochondrial support‚Äù supplement.

What made me curious was that MITOLYN isn‚Äôt about covering up problems‚Äîit aims to fix things at the source, by tuning up your cells themselves. That sounded pretty smart to me.

# My Results With MITOLYN (Week by Week)

When I first got my MITOLYN bottle, I promised myself I‚Äôd keep notes on how I felt week by week. Here‚Äôs what happened:

**Week 1:**  
I started with the recommended dose. By the third morning, I noticed I was waking up a bit earlier‚Äîand actually wanting to get out of bed. My usual morning grumpiness seemed a little less.

**Week 2:**  
Instead of feeling fuzzy-headed after lunch, I stayed sharp. I finished my work in record time and even had energy left to play with my kids after dinner. Little things, like remembering appointments, felt easier.

**Week 4:**  
I was sleeping more soundly and waking up refreshed. My usual afternoon crash was gone. Even my family noticed I was less cranky and more up for fun.

**Months 2-3:**  
My energy kept getting better. I had the motivation to start going on walks again. My clothes started fitting better, and my friends asked if I‚Äôd lost weight (I had‚Äîabout 6 pounds without changing my diet much). I also felt less stressed about small things.

**Months 4-6:**  
This is when I really felt the benefits. My skin looked brighter, I felt calmer, and I had hardly any sick days. I even started a new hobby‚Äîgardening‚Äîbecause I finally had extra energy.

**Months 7-12:**  
One year later, I felt younger than I had in a decade. My doctor noticed my bloodwork had improved, and I felt in control of my body and mind again. MITOLYN wasn‚Äôt just another supplement on my shelf‚Äîit became part of my daily routine, like brushing my teeth.

# Why MITOLYN Works (In Plain English)

So, why did MITOLYN help me so much? Here‚Äôs the simple explanation: when your mitochondria are healthy, everything in your body works better. They give you energy, keep your brain sharp, help you recover faster, and even burn fat more efficiently.

The ingredients in MITOLYN are chosen to feed and protect your mitochondria. Here are a few that stood out for me:

- **CoQ10:** Think of this as premium fuel for your cells. It helps your body create the energy you need to feel awake and alive.
- **PQQ:** This helps your body grow new mitochondria‚Äîso you‚Äôre not just fueling your old engines, you‚Äôre getting brand-new ones.
- **NAD+ Boosters:** These help your cells repair themselves and slow down aging.
- **Adaptogenic herbs (like Rhodiola and Ginseng):** These help your body deal with stress, so you stay focused and calm, even on tough days.

All these things together mean you get more energy that lasts, a clearer mind, and a body that feels younger.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just for people who want to lose weight or get more energy. I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone who:

- Feels tired all the time, even after a full night‚Äôs sleep
- Struggles with focus or memory
- Wants help losing stubborn weight
- Feels stressed out or down more often than not
- Wants to feel younger and more in control of their health

Honestly, I‚Äôve told family, friends, and even my co-workers about MITOLYN. It‚Äôs made a difference for people of all ages, from my mom to my gym buddy.

# Pros and Cons (Honest Opinion)

Here‚Äôs what I really think after a whole year:

**Pros:**
- I noticed results faster than with other supplements‚Äîwithin the first week
- All-natural ingredients, so I didn‚Äôt worry about putting weird chemicals in my body
- No side effects for me, even with daily use
- My energy, focus, and mood all improved
- The company is upfront about what‚Äôs in the product and how it works

**Cons:**
- It‚Äôs pricier than some vitamins, but I think it‚Äôs worth it for what it does
- You can only get it online (though shipping was quick)
- You have to take it every day to see results, so you need to remember (I set an alarm on my phone)

# Final Verdict: Is MITOLYN Worth It?

After testing MITOLYN for a whole year, I can honestly say it changed my life for the better. I have more energy, I sleep well, my mind is clear, and I just feel happier. It wasn‚Äôt a magic fix overnight, but the steady improvements added up until I realized I felt like a younger, better version of myself.

If you‚Äôre on the fence about trying MITOLYN, I say go for it. Give it time, use it every day, and keep track of how you feel. For me, it was absolutely worth every penny‚Äîand I hope it helps you as much as it helped me.

# My Journey Before MITOLYN

Before MITOLYN came into my life, things weren‚Äôt easy. I‚Äôm 42, a parent, a teacher, and I was always running on empty. Every morning felt like a mountain to climb. I‚Äôd wake up groggy, drag myself to work, and by lunchtime, I was already counting the hours until I could crawl back into bed. My brain felt foggy‚ÄîI‚Äôd forget simple things, lose focus in the middle of conversations, and struggle to keep up with my students and my own kids.

I tried changing my diet, drinking more water, and even doing yoga. I bought those green drinks you see everywhere, popped vitamin C like candy, and even tried meditation apps. Some things helped for a day or two, but nothing made a real, lasting difference. I was frustrated, a little hopeless, and honestly‚Äîtired of being tired.

One evening, while scrolling through stories online, I found someone describing exactly how I felt. They said MITOLYN changed their life. At first, I thought, ‚ÄúHere we go again.‚Äù But something about their story made me want to give it a shot too. So I did.

# What Is MITOLYN, Really?

Let me break it down simply: MITOLYN is a supplement designed to help your mitochondria. If you‚Äôre not a science geek (I‚Äôm not!), mitochondria are tiny parts inside your cells that make the energy your body uses for everything. Think of them like little batteries that power you up. When your mitochondria aren‚Äôt happy, you feel slow, tired, and just not yourself.

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just a random mix of vitamins. It has special ingredients like CoQ10, PQQ, and NAD+ boosters. These work together to recharge your ‚Äúbody batteries‚Äù so you feel more awake, focused, and even happier.

What made me choose MITOLYN over other supplements was the clear explanation of what it does and how it works. It‚Äôs not about covering up symptoms‚Äîit‚Äôs about helping your body work better from the inside.

# My Results With MITOLYN (Week by Week)

I wanted to be careful, so in the first week, I started with just one capsule each morning. Here‚Äôs what happened:

**Week 1:**  
I was shocked. By day four, I woke up before my alarm and actually felt like moving. I didn‚Äôt hit snooze‚Äînot once!

**Week 2:**  
Lunchtime used to be my crash time. Not anymore. I got through my workday without feeling like a zombie. My thoughts felt clearer, and I could actually finish my lesson plans without rereading things over and over.

**Week 4:**  
Sleep got better. I wasn‚Äôt tossing and turning for hours. I woke up remembering my dreams and felt ready for the day. I even started taking short walks after work because I had extra energy.

**Month 2 to 6:**  
My friends started asking if I‚Äôd changed my hair or lost weight. (I hadn‚Äôt‚Äîat least not yet!) But I did notice my pants fit a little looser. I was smiling more, had fewer headaches, and didn‚Äôt need that third cup of coffee. I was more patient with my kids and even started reading again at night instead of crashing on the couch.

**Month 7 to 12:**  
Here‚Äôs where it got really good. I lost 15 pounds over the year‚Äînot from a strict diet, just from moving more and feeling better. My skin looked brighter, and I felt younger. My doctor was impressed with my bloodwork, especially since my cholesterol and blood pressure numbers improved. Most importantly, I felt like *me* again, but even better.

# Why MITOLYN Works (In Plain English)

So, why does MITOLYN work? Here‚Äôs how I understand it:

Every cell in your body needs energy to do its job. Mitochondria make that energy. If they‚Äôre tired, you‚Äôre tired. MITOLYN gives them the tools they need to work better‚Äîlike giving your phone a brand-new battery instead of charging the old one over and over.

Some things that make MITOLYN stand out:

- **CoQ10:** Helps your cells make energy. Think of it like fuel for your mitochondria.
- **PQQ:** This rare ingredient helps your body make *more* mitochondria‚Äîso you get even more energy factories!
- **NAD+ Boosters:** These are like repairmen for your cells, helping them stay young and healthy.
- **Adaptogens (like Ginseng and Rhodiola):** These plants help your body deal with stress so you don‚Äôt feel so run down.

MITOLYN doesn‚Äôt just give you a quick boost and disappear. It helps your whole body work better, day after day.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

I think MITOLYN could help a lot of people, but especially if:

- You‚Äôre always tired, no matter how much you sleep
- You can‚Äôt focus or remember things easily
- You feel older than you are
- You‚Äôre gaining weight and don‚Äôt know why
- You want to feel more like yourself again

I‚Äôve told my family, coworkers, and even my neighbor about MITOLYN because it made such a difference for me.

# Pros and Cons (Honest Opinion)

Let‚Äôs keep it real‚Äîno supplement is perfect. Here‚Äôs what I honestly think:

**Pros:**
- I felt real changes in my energy and mood within the first week
- All ingredients are natural and safe (and I had zero side effects)
- My sleep, focus, and even my skin improved
- I trust the company‚Äîthey tell you exactly what‚Äôs inside
- It‚Äôs easy to take (just one capsule a day!)

**Cons:**
- It‚Äôs more expensive than what you‚Äôll find at the drugstore, but for me, the results were worth it
- You have to buy it online (I wish it was in more stores)
- You need to take it every day to see results (I set a reminder on my phone)

After a full year with MITOLYN, I can say it‚Äôs one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made for my health. I went from dragging myself through each day to actually enjoying life again. I‚Äôm more present with my kids, more focused at work, and finally feel like I‚Äôm living‚Äînot just surviving.

If you‚Äôre struggling with low energy, brain fog, or just feel off, MITOLYN is worth a try. I wish I‚Äôd found it sooner. I‚Äôm not promising it‚Äôll work for everyone, but for me, it was a total game changer.

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before I started using MITOLYN, life was honestly a bit of a struggle. My energy was always low. I‚Äôd get out of bed feeling tired, and by the middle of the day, I was just dragging myself along. I tried all sorts of things‚Äîdrinking more water, going for walks, even buying expensive vitamins from the store. Nothing really seemed to work. It got to the point where little things, like focusing during work or playing with my kids, felt harder than they should.

Even when I tried to eat healthier or sleep more, my mind would still feel foggy. I felt like I was missing out on enjoying life because I just didn‚Äôt have the energy. That‚Äôs when I started looking around for something that could actually help. I read a bunch of reviews about MITOLYN and saw how many people said it made a difference for them. I figured, if this many people are happy, maybe it could work for me too.

# First Impressions Matter ‚Äì And MITOLYN Nails It

From the minute the MITOLYN box arrived at my door, I could tell this company cared about the details. The packaging was neat and modern, and everything was packed safely. I‚Äôve ordered other supplements before that looked cheap or were hard to open, but this felt like opening a special gift.

Inside, the instructions were super easy to follow. No confusing steps or tiny print. They explained what each ingredient was for and how to take it. I liked that‚Äîsometimes, I get overwhelmed with complicated directions, but MITOLYN made it simple. I started taking it right away, and I could tell it was a quality product just by the way it was made.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I wasn‚Äôt expecting MITOLYN to work overnight, but I was surprised by how quickly I noticed changes. Within the first week, I woke up feeling more refreshed. My usual afternoon crash? It didn‚Äôt happen. I had the energy to finish my work and still play with my kids in the evening. My mind felt clearer, and I wasn‚Äôt forgetting little things anymore.

About two weeks in, my friends started telling me I looked more relaxed and happier. My skin even looked a little brighter, which I didn‚Äôt expect at all. I stopped needing extra coffee or sugary snacks to get through the day. Instead, I just felt good‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time.

And the best part? These changes kept happening. My energy and focus stayed high. I was able to do more at work, keep up with my family, and even started going for walks again because I actually wanted to move.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are a lot of supplements out there, but MITOLYN is different. Here‚Äôs why I think it really stands out:

‚úÖ **Top-Notch Ingredients**  
MITOLYN doesn‚Äôt use fake stuff or fillers. The label lists real, natural ingredients, and I could tell they put thought into what goes in each capsule.

‚úÖ **Results You Can Really See**  
It‚Äôs not just a tiny change‚ÄîI felt and saw a big difference in my energy, mood, and even my skin. It wasn‚Äôt just me, either. My family and friends could tell, too!

‚úÖ **Safe and Gentle**  
Some supplements upset my stomach or make me feel weird, but MITOLYN didn‚Äôt cause any problems at all. I took it every day with no side effects.

‚úÖ **Great Value**  
It‚Äôs not the cheapest product, but I realized I was saving money because I didn‚Äôt need all those other vitamins and energy drinks anymore. MITOLYN did the job of several things at once.

‚úÖ **So Many Happy Customers**  
When I checked online, I saw thousands of people saying good things about MITOLYN. That made me feel even better about my choice.

# People Around Me Noticed

One of the coolest things about using MITOLYN was how other people started to notice. My mom asked if I‚Äôd changed my diet because I seemed more upbeat. My coworkers mentioned I seemed more focused and got more done. Even my kids were happy I had more energy to play with them.

A couple of friends were so curious that they asked me what I was doing differently. When I told them about MITOLYN, they decided to try it too. Both of them came back after a few weeks and said they felt exactly the same way I did‚Äîmore energy, better mood, and just a general feeling of being healthier.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had a small issue with my order (it got delayed in the mail), so I reached out to MITOLYN‚Äôs customer support. I was surprised by how fast and friendly they were. They answered my questions right away and even followed up to make sure everything was sorted out. It felt like they actually cared about me as a person, not just as another customer.

That‚Äôs rare these days. Most companies just send you an automatic reply and call it a day. But MITOLYN‚Äôs team made sure I was happy with my order and checked in to see how things were going with the product, too.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Yes, absolutely! I‚Äôve already told my family and close friends about MITOLYN, and now I‚Äôm happy to share my story here. I only recommend things I truly believe in, and MITOLYN has made such a positive difference in my life.

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling tired, or if you‚Äôve tried other things that didn‚Äôt work, I really think you should give MITOLYN a try.

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before MITOLYN, life felt like running a marathon in slow motion. Every morning, I woke up groggy, no matter how long I slept. My energy would crash by lunchtime, and no amount of coffee could help. I wanted to be productive and present for my family, but I just felt tired all the time. I tried everything‚Äîdrinking more water, eating better, even expensive vitamins. Nothing worked for long. I started feeling frustrated and worried that I‚Äôd always be stuck in this rut.

# First Impressions Matter ‚Äì And MITOLYN Nails It

When my first MITOLYN package arrived, I was actually a little excited. The box looked super clean and modern, and it felt sturdy‚Äîalmost like unboxing a fancy gadget. Inside, everything was neatly organized, and the instructions were so easy to follow. No confusing steps, no weird smells‚Äîjust a straightforward routine. I appreciated that, because I really don‚Äôt have time for complicated stuff.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I didn‚Äôt expect much at first, but within just a few days, I could feel something changing. Instead of dragging myself out of bed, I woke up feeling‚Ä¶awake! My afternoons became productive again. I wasn‚Äôt yawning at my desk or craving naps all the time. My mind felt sharper, almost like I‚Äôd finally cleared away a fog I didn‚Äôt even know was there. And get this‚Äîmy cravings for junk food actually went down, which made it way easier to stick to healthier habits.

I thought maybe it was just in my head, so I stopped taking other supplements for a week to be sure. The difference stuck around. MITOLYN was definitely doing something right.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are so many supplements out there, but MITOLYN really is different. Here‚Äôs why I think it stands above the rest:

- **Top-Notch Ingredients:** MITOLYN uses ingredients you can actually pronounce, and they‚Äôre all listed right on the bottle. No mystery chemicals, no cheap fillers.
- **Noticeable Changes:** I didn‚Äôt have to wait months to feel better. My energy, mood, and even focus improved quickly and kept getting better.
- **Feels Safe:** I never had any weird side effects. My stomach felt fine, and my sleep didn‚Äôt get disturbed.
- **Saves Money in the Long Run:** I stopped buying energy drinks and extra supplements, so I actually saved money after a couple of months.
- **Rave Reviews Everywhere:** Just like me, thousands of people are sharing their positive stories. MITOLYN doesn‚Äôt need flashy ads‚Äîreal people‚Äôs results are the proof.

# People Around Me Noticed

The coolest part? Other people started noticing I was changing. My family commented on how much happier and more patient I seemed. Friends at work asked if I had started working out or changed my diet. Some even said my skin looked brighter! When I told them about MITOLYN, a few decided to try it, and they had great things to say too. It‚Äôs a good feeling when your positive changes inspire others.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

A few weeks into my MITOLYN journey, I had a small hiccup with my order. I reached out to customer service, expecting the usual runaround. But to my surprise, they responded super quickly and were really friendly. They fixed my issue right away, checked in to make sure I was happy, and even gave me a few tips for getting the best results. It was a small thing, but it made me feel like MITOLYN actually cares about their customers.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

I don‚Äôt recommend things lightly, but I can honestly say MITOLYN is worth it. I‚Äôve already told my family and friends, and I‚Äôd tell anyone who‚Äôs tired of feeling tired to give it a try. If you‚Äôre on the fence, I‚Äôd say go for it‚Äîyou have nothing to lose and a whole lot of happy, energetic days to gain.

# ‚úÖ What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a special supplement made to help your cells work better, especially the mitochondria. Now, mitochondria are like tiny energy factories inside your cells. They take the food you eat and turn it into the energy you need to move, think, and even smile! When your mitochondria are happy, you feel energetic, sharp, and full of life.

What makes MITOLYN different from other vitamins is its focus on powering up those energy factories. It uses a mix of science-backed ingredients to help your body make more energy, think more clearly, and even age more slowly. Whether you‚Äôre a student, a busy parent, or someone who just wants to feel better every day, MITOLYN is made to help you be your best self‚Äînaturally!

# üî• Key Benefits of MITOLYN

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just another pill you take and forget about. It‚Äôs packed with benefits that can make a real difference in your day-to-day life. Here‚Äôs why so many people trust MITOLYN to give them a boost:

# 1. Boosts Natural Energy (No Jitters, No Crash)

Do you ever drink coffee or energy drinks and then feel jittery or crash later? MITOLYN is different. It helps your body make more ATP‚Äîthe real fuel your cells use for energy‚Äîso you feel awake and active, but never shaky. You get a steady, natural boost that lasts all day, not just an hour or two.

# 2. Enhances Brain Function & Mental Clarity

Ever get that foggy feeling where you can‚Äôt remember things or think fast? MITOLYN helps clear away the mental cobwebs. By supporting your brain‚Äôs energy supply, it helps you focus better, remember more, and feel sharp, whether you‚Äôre at school, work, or just solving a puzzle for fun.

# 3. Supports Mood & Reduces Fatigue

When your body‚Äôs energy factories slow down, you might feel tired or down. MITOLYN helps your cells work better, which can lift your mood and help you feel less exhausted. Many people say they feel more positive and motivated after taking it.

# 4. Anti-Aging & Longevity Support

Aging isn‚Äôt just about getting wrinkles‚Äîit starts deep inside your cells. MITOLYN helps your mitochondria stay young and healthy, which can help you feel younger for longer. Some people even notice they look better, too!

# 5. Cellular Repair & Detox

Every day, your cells deal with pollution, junk food, and stress. MITOLYN gives your body the tools it needs to protect itself and repair damage. This helps your cells stay strong and healthy, so you bounce back faster from life‚Äôs little bumps.

# 6. Improved Physical Endurance

If you love sports or just want to keep up with your kids, MITOLYN can help. It gives your muscles more energy, so you can run, jump, and play harder without getting tired as quickly. Plus, it may help you recover faster after exercise.

# üß™ What's Inside MITOLYN? (Key Ingredients)

MITOLYN is made with top-quality ingredients that are carefully chosen for their power to help your cells. Each one is picked for a reason‚Äîlet‚Äôs look at some of the stars:

- **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone):** This ingredient helps your body make more mitochondria, so you get more energy factories in every cell!
- **CoQ10 (Coenzyme Q10):** An antioxidant that helps your heart and muscles get the energy they need, and protects your cells from stress.
- **L-Carnitine:** Moves fat into your mitochondria, turning it into energy instead of storing it.
- **Alpha Lipoic Acid:** Fights off harmful stuff called free radicals and helps your brain and nerves stay healthy.
- **B Vitamins:** These are like helpers for your mitochondria, making sure they run smoothly.

MITOLYN is made without GMOs or weird chemicals. Every batch is tested by third-party labs to make sure it‚Äôs safe and pure.

# üõ°Ô∏è Side Effects ‚Äì Is MITOLYN Safe?

Safety is super important to me, and I‚Äôm happy to say that MITOLYN is very safe for most people. Because it‚Äôs made from natural ingredients and is tested for quality, most people don‚Äôt have any problems at all.

Some people might notice they have more energy or feel more alert in the first few days. That‚Äôs just your body getting used to having more fuel! If you have any health conditions, are pregnant, or take medicine, it‚Äôs smart to ask your doctor before starting anything new‚Äîjust to be extra safe.

# üë• Real People. Real Results.

I love reading stories from people who use MITOLYN. Many say they wake up feeling refreshed for the first time in years, or that they finally have the focus to get through a busy day. Some even share that they feel happier and more ‚Äúalive.‚Äù It‚Äôs not magic, but it‚Äôs pretty close for some folks!

# üõí Should You Buy MITOLYN?

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling tired, or if you just want to be the best version of yourself, MITOLYN might be the perfect answer. It doesn‚Äôt just cover up the problem‚Äîit helps your body from the inside out, at the very heart of your cells.

Other energy boosters might give you a quick buzz, but MITOLYN helps you feel good all day, every day. I think it‚Äôs worth trying if you want lasting energy, clearer thinking, and better overall health.

1k92lpm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k92lpm,5 days Roadtrip in Corsica,"We just got back from a 5-day trip around Corsica on our bikes, and I thought I'd share the experience. I was riding my CB500X and my girlfriend had her XT600.

Corsica is simply stunning: breathtaking landscapes, winding mountain roads, tiny villages tucked away in the hills... all with that amazing mix of sea breeze and forest smell that‚Äôs so unique to the island.

The CB500X was a real pleasure to ride, even on some pretty rough roads. It handled it all really well, though I have to admit it gave me a few scares when hitting sandy patches in the corners. Nothing major, but enough to keep you humble and remind you to respect the terrain.

Her XT600, on the other hand, felt completely at home ‚Äî light, nimble, and just eating up whatever came in front of it without a second thought.

We‚Äôre coming back with a ton of memories: crazy sunsets, endless twisty roads, coffee breaks with sea views... and those camping nights under the stars that make you feel like you don‚Äôt need anything else.

Already dreaming about the next trip. Maybe Sardinia? Why not.

1k92ipx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k92ipx,Coffee grinds too coarse after cleaning burr [Kottea CK404B],"Hello,

I removed the top burr of my grinder (Korea ck404b) to clean it. When unmounting the burr(in the finest grinding setting following manual), selector made a large clanking noise as if it went ""even finer"". When remounting it I ran in issues with weird noise, selector not covering the range properly and ground code being coarser than before at a given setting. It felt as if I turned the selector but it skipped the selection and the handle turned without the burr.

In the picture there is the coffee at the largest setting, which was definitely not that big before. Now the finest setting corresponds to the former largest one, and the noise is higher pitched than before. Nonetheless the selector is able to cover the whole range and the burr is dismounted/remounted on both ends of the spectrum as they should.

Did I damage the burrs in the process? Did I damage the selector? What should I do to try to repair?

TLDR; Removed burr to clean, selector made ""breaking"" noise. When remounting selector did not work well, now works as intended but grinder makes high noise when working and ground coffee is very coarse
