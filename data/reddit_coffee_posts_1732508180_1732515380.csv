1gzcayi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gzcayi/im_a_911_operator_and_some_of_our_calls_are/,I'm a 911 operator and some of our calls are strange ,"Hey everyone, sorry about the cliff hanger. There’s been a few… interesting developments. 

I’m going to start off where I left things last time. Andy trench, like I said it stank and was vomit inducing. 

Jordan gave me no time to react though, with an iron grip on my wrist he led me back to the call center. 

He didn’t let go at the front door, we marched right through the lobby, past the phone booths and to the bathrooms. 

I winced at my reflection, I looked like a cosplayer for a horror movie. Only this wasn’t a movie, it was my life. 

I sat on the countertop and rested my head in my hands. I was so tired, this isn’t how I thought my night would go. 

Jordan waited for the water to get warm before soaking a towel in the sink. I sat there, too numb to react as he washed Andy’s blood off of me. 

He even took the time to wash it out of my hair. I wasn’t out of it enough to change my shirt with him there, I went to the lobby for that. 

Then I sat on the floor. It was painful in the beginning, it was like the tears had to break their way out of me. Once the first one fell the rest came rushing after. My whole body convulsed with sobs, I cried until I couldn’t cry anymore. This job is so fucked. 

I put myself back together, I brushed my hair and grabbed a snack. My clothes were clean enough, the sticky feeling of blood covered skin was gone. It was time to get back to work. 

Jordan was at his desk. Perfect. 

I walked up and slammed both of my hands down on the cheap wood. I tried not to flinch as the impact sent a shock up my arms. “Ok Jordan, what’s with the book of names? And who are the Andy’s you’ve been killing?” 

Jordan glanced up from the western he was reading, “it is a book with the names of people living within range of the radio station. The Andy’s are clearly clones, fungi or cyborgs”. 

He lifted the book again as if the conversation was over. I pulled the book down and glared at him, “what is the significance of the names?” Jordan pulled the book away from me, “they are the names, of people, within range of the radio station”. 

He leaned back in his chair as if moving the book a foot farther back would deter me. As soon as he tried to resume his reading I snatched the book away. 

“You can have this back when you give me some satisfactory answers”. I crossed my arms smugly. Jordan leaned down and with a key he seemingly produced from thin air he unlocked one of the drawers of his desk. Finally, some progress! 

Jordan than pulled an exact copy of the book I had in my hand out of the drawer. With a hint of a smirk he leaned back and began reading again. 

I stormed around to the other side of the desk and plunged my hand into the still open drawer. Jordan grabbed my bicep, “DON’T!” I shouted catching both of us by surprise, but it worked. He let go of me, Jordan waved his hand as if to say “go ahead”.

He put his nose right back into that stupid western. I pulled the leather book of names and a folder out of the drawer. I stomped over to my desk and sat. 

I had looked at the book previously, while I suspected there was more to it than Jordan was letting on I was more curious about the folder. 

It was an ordinary off white folder like you would find in a filing cabinet. I glanced over at Jordan, he appeared to be paying me no mind. 

Inside the folder was a number of envelopes, each with a name hand written across the front. 

Unlike the ones in the book the names here meant something to me, they were the names of people I knew. People like Andy, Edwin, or “Nic”, Chuck, myself, what looked to be everyone at Greenbrier FD, PD and the local politicians. 

The envelope on top was still crisp, it had “Allyson” freshly scrawled across it. 

I opened it. The contents were confusing, there was a page with basic information. 
Name: Allyson Studebaker 
Age: unknown
Origin: unknown
Assessment: She calls herself Allyson Studebaker, claims to be nineteen years old. Stands at roughly five foot eleven, estimated weight of one hundred eighty pounds. Red hair, black eyes. Observation shows a lack of familiarity with normal objects and pop culture references. 

Continued observation needed to determine threat level. 

I looked up from the page, the envelope also contained more than a few photos of Allyson. They seemed strangely consensual, she appeared to be posing in all of them. 

I couldn’t help but notice the envelope with my name on it. 

I jumped and nearly screamed when a hand grabbed my shoulder. I turned to see Jordan standing next to me, the way he could cross a room without making a sound was so creepy. 

“You won’t find what you’re looking for in there” he said before pulling up a chair and sitting in it. “I wasn’t sure about you in the beginning, the way you took all the weird happenings in this place in stride was suspicious”. 

“I get it though, you grew up here and weird stuff is just part of life”. He seemed to be lost in his own thoughts for a moment. 

“I don’t think I can fully satisfied your curiosity but I believe you deserve to know as much as I do. Especially now that you are so deeply involved, just know that you can’t unlearn things. If you keep pursuing this path your life will change”. 

It didn't sound like a threat, it sounded like a genuine warning. I had to think for a minute, if I let this go would my life calm down? Possibly, but I know myself well enough to know that I would never be ok with just hiding. I needed some closure, I needed the information Jordan had to offer. 

I nodded my head, “go on, I need to know”. Jordan sighed, “I shouldn’t have hoped for anything else. Grab a coffee for each of us, it’s going to be a long night”. 

Jordan’s humanlike behavior was an unexpected but welcome surprise. I was finally going to get some answers. 

The coffee pot in the lobby was already full, grabbing two mugs I filled them and placed them in the microwave. 

As I watched the timer count down something caught my attention. I walked closer to the sink, it sounded like air was coming up from the drain. A rank stench hit my nose. 

I recoiled just as a warm burp of disgusting air oozed out of the drain. The smell filled the lobby almost instantly. I was so busy repressing a gag I almost missed the whispering. 

I gagged hard, hot vomit was trying to force it’s way out. I stubbornly held it in, the whispering grew louder. It held a viscous and feral tone. I could physically feel the hunger in the voice as it gurgled up from the drain. 

“You took from us, now we will take you”. My hands shook violently, my eyes felt as if they were going to come out of my head. The whole room was thick with that putrid air, the scent was thick enough to tint the lights red. 

I was on the ground, I had to get up. I had to get out, I clawed my way across the concrete floor. The coolness of the ground beneath me brought a small amount of clarity to my brain. 

I found a wall and pulled myself up. Everything was spinning, I lost the battle with my stomach and spewed my lunch across the floor. 

There was a bang at the door, the one leading outside. Another bang, something was trying to get in. I tried to cry out for Jordan, all I achieved was choking on the puke still in my mouth. 

Despite my body feeling weak and my head spinning I managed to make a run for the door leading to the call center. I hit the steel hard, pain shot through my wrist. 

The door opened and I fell through the opening. A hand grabbed the back of my shirt and lifted me away from the doorway. 

Jordan was locking the doors as something on the other side was bashing against them. He managed to slip the locks into place. I breathed a sigh of relief, those new doors were quite robust. 

With the air free from that horrid odor I found myself feeling a lot better almost instantly. I got to my feet and followed Jordan to his office, he turned the monitor enough for me to be able to see it. 

The lobby was filled with a repulsive writhing mass of sweat covered flesh. A few looked like Andy, but most were corrupted copies of a copy. Limbs were the wrong length, some had too many fingers while others had too few. 

I didn’t hesitate for a second, I pressed the S.O.S button. Jordan removed his shotgun from where it had been concealed. He placed two shells on his desk while loading the rest into the firearm. 

He noticed my questioning look, “it’s just in case there’s no other escape. Some things are worse than death”. I was repulsed at the very thought but Jordan was already on the move.

“Check the bathroom, I’m going to barricade the door”. I nodded then rushed across the room. I opened the bathroom door to find the window smashed. A head protruded into the room surrounded by a dozen arms each jostling for room. 

The head was lifeless, it’s eyes bulging and tongue rolling about freely. These things had crushed one of their own in an attempt to gain entry, it was clear nothing short of death would stop them. 

The windows small size was our saving grace, the concrete walls were robust enough that even these ghouls couldn’t break though. 

The same couldn’t be said for the main door, I jerked around as Jordan’s gun boomed. A corner of the main door had come free of the frame and was bowing in under the weight of the Andy’s. 

Jordan shot again, and then again. Each time he fired there would be a brief moment where the door would nearly return to it’s place. Only to be crashed into once again, it was a losing battle. The gap was growing with each moment. 

The cacophony of gunshots left my ears ringing. There was a look of desperation on Jordan’s face, he was scared. 

It was a sobering realization, through all the weird shit we had seen Jordan had never looked the last bit afraid. 

The gun went off three more times, Jordan looked at the empty chamber then up to me. “Grab those shells off my desk”

I did as he asked, Jordan had his back against the door in an attempt to brace it. He loaded our remaining shots, “Kylie”. He seemed to struggle with finding the right words, “I’m sorry, I won’t let them take me back. I’m sorry that there isn’t more I can do for you, I won’t make your decision for you but I suggest you follow my lead”. 

 “Jordan the police are on their way, we just have to hold the door. We’ll be ok”. 

He had a tired smile on his face, “for your sake I hope so. But I won’t risk it”. 

Jordan placed his chin over the barrel of the shotgun, “it’s ok to close your eyes Kylie”. 

The realization of what he planned on doing hit me, I lunged forward. “Jordan don’t!” 

He pulled the trigger, a loud click rang out. My heart nearly stopped, the gun hadn’t fired. Annoyed Jordan inspected the shotgun, he ejected the shell and chambered the next one. 

While he did so he leaned forward, it was only for a moment. Jordan instantly realized his mistake, but it was too late. The door was forced open enough for three arms to reach into the room. 

They grabbed Jordan, dirty pink fingers resembling pig flesh dug into Jordan. He was lifted from the ground, the shotgun clattered to the floor. Jordan elbowed and kicked but the arms were too strong. 

They lifted him off his feet, before I could react his head disappeared through the hole. He screamed out, “shoot Kylie! Shoot!”

I was frozen, the gun lay just a few feet away yet I couldn’t grab it. Jordan’s desperation increased as his shoulders wedged against the door frame. I reached forward to grab his leg, to try and pull him back. But it was too late. With a wet crack the rest of him conformed to the hole and disappeared. 

The door buckled wildly as the bodies on the other side renewed their attack. I backed away, I didn’t want to risk getting close enough to grab the gun. Not now that the gap was large enough for those things to get their heads through. 

In a terrifying spectacle of contortion one of the Andy’s started to squeeze into the room. I ran for the bathroom, my last stand. Careful to avoid the arm filled window I slammed the heavy metal door shut. I didn’t know how long it would hold, I just prayed it would be long enough. 

Soon I could hear them in the other room, the shattering of glass and slapping of bare feet on concrete rang out. 

I wished they made more noise, even if it was zombie like groans. Anything would be better then the silent way they attacked, the only sound being their bodies against the surrounding environment. 

Just as I feared, they soon began to assault the bathroom door. It was thick and well built but I knew it wouldn’t hold forever. I sat with my back to it, I faced the open window and the lifeless head still trapped within the frame. I could feel the door bend and flex. It wouldn’t be long now, I just hoped it wouldn’t hurt too badly. 

A rapid succession of pops from outside caught my attention. More pops followed by shouts, someone was out there! 

I screamed out “I’m in here! Help me! Please!” They no longer beat against the door, something else had caught their attention. I screamed as a bullet pierced the door just inches above my head. 

It sounded like a battlefield, then as if a switch had been flipped, silence. 

I nearly jumped out of my skin when someone knocked on the door. “Hey you still alive in there?” I knew that voice! 

I ripped open the door and rushed out, Dean embraced me tightly, “it’s good to see you Kay, I was worried. Are you alone?” 

I didn’t have to answer, one look at my face was all Dean needed. “I’m sorry Kay, let’s get you out of here”. Another officer rushed in, “yo we got company! And a lot of it”. 

Dean took charge, “alright Tejano, I’m going to clear a path to the car with the M240, I want you to follow right behind me with Kylie”. 

Tejano looked uncertain, “you sure you can walk while shooting that?” Dean shouldered the big gun, “watch and see”. Dean hit the lobby at a brisk pace, I was right behind him with Tejano taking up the rear. 

We made it out of the building before the horde broke the treeline. Dean opened fire, I saw bodies, these ones even more disfigured than the last wave start to fall.

Dean’s pace slowed as he fired, behind me Tejano opened fire as well. Between both of them they managed to keep the clones at bay until we reached the cruiser.

Wasting no time the three of us climbed into the car. Tejano punched the gas the instant he was inside. Dean hung out the window hosing down our pursuers. 

The car hit a particularly large bump, Dean dropped his gun and likely would have fallen out of the car if I hadn’t grabbed his legs. 

“Thanks Kay” said Dean once back inside. Tejano drove the cruiser like it was a rally car, we reached main street in record time. 

Nothing followed us out of the woods, two more cruisers were on standby at the edge of town just to be safe. 

I got out of the car. Dean and Tejano did the same, I knew they had questions but I didn’t have any answers. 

Everyone’s attention was diverted from me to the sound of rotors over head. A sleek looking helicopter zipped past town at a questionably low altitude. 

Tejano whistled in admiration, “yo Dean was that what I think it was?” Dean nodded, “looked like an AH-64 to me, notice the lack of decals and tail number? That bad bitch was totally blacked out”. 

I flinched at the distant sound of explosions, the booms were soon followed by something that sounded like chainsaw but was much too loud to be one. 

Dean led me back to his place, “you can stay here as long as you want”. I thanked him, his house was very male centric. Plus I wanted to sleep in my own bed, I told Dean as much. I just wanted to go home. 

He didn't like the idea but drove me there anyways. “You be careful ok? I’ll be on patrol for the next few hours but then I can spend the night if you want. What ever you need to feel safe”. 

He was sweet, but I needed my independence back. I needed to know I could move on from everything that happened and still be myself. “Thanks Dean, you’re the best. And thanks again for saving me, I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t arrived when you did”. That was a lie, I know I would have died a painful death like Jordan had.

 Dean reluctantly left, he made sure I had my hand gun close by and loaded. We compromised on keeping it chambered but leaving the hammer down. 

Hours ticked by, I hadn’t moved from the chair I sat in after Dean left. My brain was a mess of memories, each one assaulting the others in an attempt to be in the front. 

Sometime after the sun had set I heard a knock at the front door. Call it paranoia but pulled the hammer on my pistol back. Slowly I made my way down the stairs and across the kitchen. 

I peaked through the curtains, two men in suits stood on my porch. Still wary I unlocked the door and opened it. The lead man flashed a badge, “good evening ma’am, we have reason to believe this is the residence of Kylie [REMOVED]. May we come in?” 

I almost said yes, I don’t know why but I felt compelled to do as they asked. Coming to my senses I shook my head and went to close the door. The nearest man blocked the door from closing, “ma’am I would reconsider. There are a few bodies that can be linked to you, or they can be handled discreetly. The choice is yours”. 

I let them in. I offered them something to drink but they both refused. They each flashed a badge too fast for me to see much of anything, “I’m agent Planck and this is my partner agent Stark, we understand you are under a certain amount of stress but we must ask something of you”. 

I felt like the use of such obvious fake names was a bit insulting but I let “Planck” continue his speech. 

“The call center cannot be unmanned. You are the most experienced operator in this whole county. We need you to return to work”. 

I started to laugh, it wasn’t joyful or voluntary. The sheer absurdity of Planck’s request was beyond belief. 

“No. I’ve done enough”.

 The agents glanced at each other, Planck spoke again, “I’m afraid we were not asking. You have been promoted to manager, you have been provided five people. They will stay on until you find their replacements”. 

I shook my head vigorously, “you’re not hearing me. I’m not going back, I quit. Throw me in jail for all I care, it would be better than entering that hell hole again”. 

Agent Stark chuckled, “ma’am that place is far from hell. Listen carefully, we are going to take you back to the call center. You are going to behave and do your job. If you attempt to flee we will find you and you will beg us to let you escape to hell”. 

Planck took over, “it’s pretty simple, you can come along and get a nice raise along with your promotion. Or you can be difficult and kick the goad the entire way. The choice is yours”. 

My shoulders slumped, “can I pack a bag?” Planck nodded. Resigned to my fate I went upstairs and packed an over night bag. 

When I was done the agents led me outside. Two black Tahoe’s were parked in front of my house. Planck handed me a key ring with a Chevy fob on it. “The back one is yours, consider it a sign on bonus. You’ll find good behavior can be very rewarding”.

I followed the agents to the call center, when we pulled up I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It had been roughly six hours since the attack.

The fence was brand new, it was taller, and black. It now had coils of wire on the top. A heavy gate opened for us as we drove up. 

The building had been painted, I could smell the fresh lacquer curing as we walked up. The front doors had been replaced with what looked like blast doors. The inside of the lobby was clean, painted and had all new appliances. 

Inside the call center was more of the same, everything was new down to the toilets. I barely recognized the place. They had installed carpet and proper lighting giving the room an almost comfortable feel. 

Except I knew why everything had been replaced. The walls were stained with horror so deep no amount of paint could hide it all.

I looked around, my map was gone. Years of data erased in a moment, I wondered if it had been destroyed or confiscated. Jordan’s desk with all its secrets had been replaced as well. The place was sanitized of all its history.

I instinctively flinched at the sound of the doors behind me opening. In walked what I assumed must be the five promised workers. 

Krista was first in, she wore a perfectly pressed grey suit and had her hair pulled into a painfully tight ponytail. She was curt and to the point with her introduction. 

Padric had a little more personality, luckily he wasn’t insulted when I referred to him as Patrick the first couple times. Like Krista he wore a suit but his was mostly black. 

Stephan stood out the most, due to his attire as well as his size. He strode into the room narrowly avoiding knocking his head on the door frame. He wore blue jeans and a simple white T-shirt that looked as if it was painted onto his steroid enhanced tribal tattoo covered torso. 

Dale was by far the oldest, he had a quiet voice with a hint of an accent to it. He wore a suit as well but no tie and it fit loosely, Dale looked the most at ease of the four. 

Planck looked at his watch with annoyance, “where is agent Shang?” No one knew. 

Planck and Stark looked ready to leave but I had a feeling they couldn’t until everything was squared away. Ten minutes later we heard footsteps running through the lobby. 

A younger guy rushed into the room, he was slightly out of breath. “Sorry I’m late, GPS took me all over the place. I had to pull over and ask some random house for directions”.

 Planck ignored his excuse, “this is the final member of your team, Conner Shang. 22 years old, graduated bottom of his class and clearly unable to follow written directions”. 

Without another Planck turned and left. Stark handed me a folder, “everything you need is in there. Don’t call unless it’s an emergency or else we’ll make it one”. 

I stuck my tongue out at Stark’s  back as he left the room. Too late I realized the five people still in the room likely reported to Planck and Stark or their mutual boss. 

I glanced at the thick stack of papers in the folder than up to the waiting group of strangers. 

I cleared my throat, “so… who knows what they’ve been signed up for?”

To be 100% honest, I am a brokey right now lol. Not desperate, just that I used to make a very high salary (mid six figures) but AI lowered it to just making the bare minimum to survive. So not only is it expensive financially to travel, but it’s also expensive with my time because my time is valuable. I could be using that time to upskill instead and ensure my future. I have goals!

1gzc8cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Taurusgang/comments/1gzc8cd/a_taurus_classmate/,A Taurus classmate ,"Hi Tauruses 

I want to share an experience I’ve had with a Taurus I met in class this term. For context, I am a Leo/24F and he is a Taurus in his late 30s.

On the first day of class he was very open to share what he does for a living, why he’s back in school, etc. He offered two other students in the class and myself to use his hard copy of the class textbook. He also emailed our class partner and myself additional class resources. Overall, he came across as willing to help and talkative. In the beginning, I didn’t really know what to make of his behavior, but throughout the term I’ve grown to really like him as a person. A couple weeks into the term he gave me an online access code for the class textbook for free. We typically walk out of class together once it ends and overall keep tabs on each others day to day life. Any questions I have, casual or school related, he answers. I’ve learned so much about him from all the questions I’ve asked. Some weeks ago he let me know which class and professor he is going to register with next term. I was under the impression that maybe he thought we should take the class together as I need to complete the same class as well. Although, he didn’t actually say we should take it together. He also lets me know whether or not he will be on campus on specific days. More recently, I told him I had a job interview at a major retail store in town and he asked me which location. I thought that was an interesting follow up question from him. The term is coming to an end so I let him know I’ve had fun getting to know him. He said “Thank you”. 

He gives me a good impression on Tauruses. I’ve been friends and dated my fair share of Taurus placements. I think when Taurus enjoy your company they typically act like the classmate Im writing about. I like how he doesn’t make me feel annoying or pushes me away energetically when we interact. Even with our stark differences, it feels rather seamless. 

A few years ago I had a similar experience with a different Taurus male classmate. Each term he would ask me for my class schedule and he would register for the same classes as me. We would hangout inside and outside of school. Sometimes taking me to get coffee and eventually introducing me to his friend group who are still my good friends to this day. 

Anyways, I really appreciate Taurus. They make me feel included and I get a companionship feeling from them :)",2,1732514760.0,Taurusgang,0,1.0,False
1gzc77p,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1gzc77p/what_coffee_machine_is_the_best/,What Coffee Machine Is The Best?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on a wild journey trying to find the perfect coffee machine for my daily caffeine fix, and I thought I'd share my experience with you all.

After spending countless hours researching and testing different coffee makers (and drinking way too much coffee in the process), I've finally found what I believe is the best coffee machine for most people. I'll break down everything you need to know about choosing the right one for your needs.

First off, let's be real - there's no one-size-fits-all solution. Your perfect coffee machine depends on your lifestyle, budget, and how serious you are about your brew. But I've noticed some key features that really matter:

1. Brewing Speed
Nobody wants to wait forever for their morning coffee. The best coffee machines I've tried can brew a full pot in under 10 minutes.

2. Temperature Control
This is crucial! The ideal brewing temperature is between 195-205°F. Anything less and you're not getting the full flavor from your beans.

3. Ease of Cleaning
Trust me, this matters more than you think. You'll thank yourself later for choosing a machine with removable parts that are dishwasher safe.

If you're looking for specific recommendations, I've found an amazing selection here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

What really impressed me about the top performers was their consistency. Whether you're brewing light roast or dark, these machines extract the perfect flavor every time.

For those who are serious about their coffee, I'd recommend looking for machines with:
- Programmable settings
- Built-in grinders
- Water filtration systems
- Thermal carafes

The prices can range from $30 to $300+, but you don't need to spend a fortune to get great coffee. I've found some excellent mid-range options that deliver barista-quality results.

After months of testing, I can confidently say that the best machines strike a balance between functionality and user-friendliness. You can check out my top picks here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

Some quick pro tips:
- Always use filtered water
- Clean your machine monthly (at minimum)
- Invest in a good grinder if your machine doesn't include one
- Use fresh beans whenever possible

Remember, the best coffee machine is the one that fits your routine and makes you happy to wake up in the morning. Whether you're a casual sipper or a coffee connoisseur, there's a perfect match out there for you.

Let me know if you have any questions! I'm always happy to chat about coffee and share what I've learned along the way.",1,1732514642.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

1gzc4mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeWrite/comments/1gzc4mj/musings_about_almost_everything_all_at_once/," Musings about almost everything, all at once. ","There is something about the human condition that seems forever tied to the concept of longing. It is the space between what we have and what we wish for, the unbridgeable gap that we spend our lives trying to close. But what if the longing itself becomes the bridge, spanning the distance between who we are and who we were with the ones who have touched us? What if connection, in its fleeting and incomplete nature, isn’t bound by space and time, but rather transcends it?

The spaces between us have always been paradoxical: vast and intimate, unbridgeable yet impossibly close. She lived one town away, but she may as well have been a universe apart. We inhabited different times, different worlds. Still, somehow, we found each other in the noise of everything—two satellites locked in orbit, our trajectories crossing for a moment that felt like it could stretch into eternity. And yet, like all celestial paths, ours was governed by forces larger than us: time, distance, fear.

It should have meant nothing. A passing encounter. Yet, improbably, we uncovered a familiarity that defied explanation, as if we were rediscovering something we had lost rather than building something new. There was no reason for it—no reason for her to lean on me as she did, no reason for me to feel like I had known her forever.

I think about the nature of distance. It isn’t just geography; it isn’t measured in kilometers or minutes. Distance is a crack in a conversation, the half-second where you pause before answering, the look you give someone when they offer more of themselves than you’re ready to receive. Distance is her voice on the phone, trembling and raw, and the way she pulled back when I tried to step closer. Distance is her laughter echoing in a dream, laughter I couldn’t tell is meant for me or the world she left behind.

Time, too, betrays us. It’s supposed to heal, but all it really does is stretch the ache, making it feel smaller yet deeper, like a river carving canyons into stone. Time rearranges the pieces of memory, mixing joy with regret until you can’t tell one from the other. I hear the clock ticking, but it doesn’t move forward; it loops, repeating the same moments over and over. The first time she called me, crying. The last time I messaged her, angry. The middle, where I thought we might be something whole.

That’s when I realized, the human heart is full of contradictions. She trusted me enough to cry in my ear but not enough to let me in. She laughed with me but recoiled when I tried to step closer. She told me she didn’t want to be known, but how could I not try to know her? How could I not take that small, precious sliver of her that she offered—her voice, her words, her pain—and try to see the whole picture?

I wonder if she remembers that night. Out of the dark, calling me without warning, her tears breaking through the static, and I didn’t know what to say except, “I’m here.” What else could I say? She gave me a glimpse of something sacred in that moment—her pain, her trust, her fragile humanity—and I held it in my hands like a piece of glass. But glass cuts, and it shattered between us before I could figure out what to do with it. Did she feel it too, that breaking? Or was it always inevitable?

Maybe that’s what human connection is: the infinite ways we collide and break against each other, splintering into shards that still carry the shape of the whole. She let me see pieces of her, but I wanted all of her, and that’s where I faltered. She asked me not to find her, to respect the shadows she lived in, but I reached anyway, thinking I could pull her into the light. When she said she didn’t want to be known, I should have asked what she meant, but I was too afraid of the answer. What I feared most wasn’t rejection—it was confirmation that I wasn’t the one who could help her.

To care for someone in their unraveling is to stand on the shore as the tide carries them out, knowing you cannot follow. You become a witness, a keeper of their image as they disappear into themselves. And it isn’t just their drowning you grieve—it’s your own helplessness, the weight of love that isn’t enough, that was never meant to be enough. She said, “I’ll never be okay,” and I heard it as both a truth and a challenge. I thought I could show her otherwise, but the truth never needed me to believe it.

It is here, I think, that the tragedy of human connection lies: the desperate need to understand each other and the impossibility of ever fully doing so. There were pieces of her that I could see, even feel, but they never added up to a whole. And perhaps they never could. She was a puzzle that refused to be solved, a constellation whose stars were too scattered to form a picture. I thought if I could just reach far enough, if I could gather the fragments of her into my arms, I might show her that she didn’t have to carry it all alone. But I never reached far enough. Or maybe she never let me.

Some connections are too brief to justify their weight. Ours was fleeting, a flicker of something too raw to sustain itself, but it was heavier than most bonds I’ve known. I remember that one night vividly. I asked her to let me take her for coffee. It wasn’t much, just a casual invitation, but to me, it felt like a way to bridge the distance between us, to make something intangible real. She said, “Sure, we’ll see,” and for a moment, I believed that someday, we might sit across from each other, sharing the same air, no screens, no filters—just her and me. But “we’ll see” turned into never, and I wonder now if I was foolish to hope for more.

That’s the thing about hope—it’s so easy to lose and so dangerous to hold onto. I hoped that I could be the one to make her feel less alone, but I know now how arrogant that was. That’s the paradox of care, isn’t it? It’s inherently selfish, no matter how selfless it feels. I didn’t just want the person to heal; I wanted to be the one who healed her. And when I couldn’t, I started to question everything—my worth, my intentions, my place in her story. But now, I learned that there are some battles we fight in silence, some wars we wage against ourselves that no one else can end.

And maybe that’s the lesson. Maybe human connection isn’t about saving each other. Maybe it’s about bearing witness to each other’s pain, even when we can’t fix it. Maybe it’s about standing at the edge of someone’s darkness and saying, “I see you. I can’t pull you out, but I won’t look away.”

I dream of her sometimes. In the dream, I’m living in a house she once called home. It isn’t really a house; it’s a collection of spaces where she existed, where I exist now. The walls hum with her laughter, the corners drip with her tears, and I go about my life pretending not to notice. Time folds in on itself here—she’s in the past, I’m in the present, but we’re sharing the same air, separated by nothing but the veil of memory. She’s there, but she’s not. I acknowledge her, but I don’t reach out for her. And maybe I never could.

When I wake, I swear I catch the faint scent of the sea, sharp and briny, as if she’s walked through the room and left the door open behind her.

But that’s what connection is, isn’t it? Not something we can hold, but something that holds us. And so, I carry her in the hollow spaces she left behind, not knowing if she’s gone or if she’s simply waiting in the cracks between moments, watching as I try—and fail—to let her go.

What are ghosts, if not the parts of people that stay behind? There’s a peculiar loneliness in carrying someone who’s still alive. She is a ghost to me now, but not the kind that frightens. She’s the kind that lives in the spaces I can’t quite fill, the silence between songs, the pauses in conversations I have with myself. I carry her, not like a wound but like a scar—something healed but unforgotten. There’s a strange comfort in her haunting. It reminds me that what we had, though brief, was real.

She haunts me in the best way, as a reminder of what it means to care deeply, even when it hurts. She reminds me that love isn’t always about permanence or reciprocity. Sometimes it’s about holding on to the fragments, the moments, the whispers of someone who passed through your life like a shooting star—brief but brilliant. You don’t forget people like that. You learn to live alongside them, like a shadow in the room you don’t bother turning to see.

Human connection defies space and time, but it doesn’t escape them. We meet each other in the gaps, in the brief moments where our timelines intersect, and then we part, returning to the separate paths we were always meant to walk. I wonder, though: do the paths ever truly separate? Or do we keep walking, side by side, our shadows touching even when we cannot?

She left, but she didn’t leave. She moved away from me in ways I couldn’t follow, but her presence lingers. I hear it in Daughter’s songs, in the lines about silver rings and disjointed dreams. I feel it in the memories that surface when I least expect them: her teasing, her quiet apologies, the way she said “goodnight” like it was both a farewell and a promise. It’s not just her I’m mourning—it’s the version of myself that believed I could save her. She exists in fragments now, scattered but vivid, and I wonder if I exist the same way for her.

There is a part of me that wants to blame time, to say that if we had just a little more of it, we could have been more. But time didn’t betray us. We did that ourselves, with our fear and fragility, our longing and miscommunication. Time merely revealed the cracks that were already there, widening them until the light couldn’t find its way through.

I think, sometimes, about what it means to let go. Not of her, but of the need to hold onto what we could have been. I think about how ghosts fade, not because we forget but because we learn to carry them differently. Rein will always be with me, in the spaces where I am most human, most raw. She’ll be there when I hear a song that feels like us, or when I reach for someone else and hope they don’t pull away. She’ll be there, not as the pain of what was lost, but as the beauty of what was.

We met, we collided, and we broke. But even broken things have a kind of grace, a way of catching the light that unbroken things never will.

This isn’t about holding on, and it isn’t about letting go. It’s about carrying the weight of what was and what wasn’t, the chaos and the beauty of it all, and letting it shape you. It’s about understanding that some stories don’t end—they linger. And so do the people in them.

Neither of us has had money to put the kids in daycare. So, since my work allows me some flexibility, I've been picking up the kids daily from school. This allows me to see them almost every day, which has been great. 

The ex lost her job, the one where she had met AP, found a new job and has also now picked up a second job at a coffee stand for a couple days. So now she's working every day and still doesn't have enough money. Says she's drowning, the car she picked out, is too expensive. Told her that I'd be fine going with her to sell it, then she can find something priced more affordable. She says, ""But it won't be as nice"". I'm just shaking my head.

So now, she messages me saying she wants to take the kids and move back to Nevada, where her family is from. Obviously, I don't support this. I don't know where she thinks she has the money to move. But she has no savings and nothing lined up.

So I told her, I'll take the kids full-time and she can move back there and focus on getting her life straight. I know her plan would be to move in to her sister's house, so it'd be 9 people in that house if she took the kids. No job, no daycare, nothing.

She starts going on about how I've gotten everything I wanted, she's financially ruined, and I should be proud because I'm ""fucking over the mother of your children."" But she didn't like when I pointed out all the ways I've been helping her out

And she had just messaged my lawyer the previous week saying that she had agreed to the rest of my proposals! She said she'd wanted to finish this and get her lump sum... I didn't say anything, because I don't know what lump sum she's talking about. I guess the portion of my 401k?

1gzbyoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSqueeze/comments/1gzbyoq/chat_with_chat_gt_about_silver/,chat with chat gt about silver,"what would the price be if you monetized all fiat to silver

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

To calculate the price of silver if all fiat currency in circulation were monetized into silver, we can compare the **total global fiat money supply** with the **total amount of above-ground silver available**. Here’s how it breaks down:

# Key Numbers

1. **Global Fiat Money Supply (M2)**:
   * Total global M2 (broad money): \~$100 trillion (as of 2024).
2. **Above-Ground Silver Supply**:
   * Estimated at **2–3 billion ounces** of physical silver readily available.

# Price Calculation

If we monetize all $100 trillion of fiat money into the estimated 2.5 billion ounces of silver (average of 2–3 billion):

Price per ounce=Total Fiat Money SupplyTotal Available Silver\\text{Price per ounce} = \\frac{\\text{Total Fiat Money Supply}}{\\text{Total Available Silver}}Price per ounce=Total Available SilverTotal Fiat Money Supply​ Price per ounce=100 trillion dollars2.5 billion ounces=40,000 dollars per ounce.\\text{Price per ounce} = \\frac{100 \\, \\text{trillion dollars}}{2.5 \\, \\text{billion ounces}} = 40,000 \\, \\text{dollars per ounce}.Price per ounce=2.5billion ounces100trillion dollars​=40,000dollars per ounce.

# Scenarios

1. **With Higher Above-Ground Stocks**:
   * If additional silver from industrial recovery, jewelry, and unreported holdings were included, the total might reach **5 billion ounces**, reducing the price: Price per ounce=100 trillion dollars5 billion ounces=20,000 dollars per ounce.\\text{Price per ounce} = \\frac{100 \\, \\text{trillion dollars}}{5 \\, \\text{billion ounces}} = 20,000 \\, \\text{dollars per ounce}.Price per ounce=5billion ounces100trillion dollars​=20,000dollars per ounce.
2. **If Only Reserve Silver Is Monetized**:
   * Global silver reserves (560,000 metric tons or \~18 billion ounces) represent economically recoverable silver: Price per ounce=100 trillion dollars18 billion ounces≈5,556 dollars per ounce.\\text{Price per ounce} = \\frac{100 \\, \\text{trillion dollars}}{18 \\, \\text{billion ounces}} \\approx 5,556 \\, \\text{dollars per ounce}.Price per ounce=18billion ounces100trillion dollars​≈5,556dollars per ounce.

# Practical Considerations

1. **Price Adjustment**:
   * This price assumes a one-to-one replacement of fiat money with silver. In reality, silver’s price would be influenced by:
      * **Demand elasticity**: Not everyone would convert fiat into silver.
      * **Industrial use competition**: High prices might restrict silver to high-value transactions or savings.
2. **Fractional Reserve System**:
   * If silver backed only a **fraction** of fiat money (e.g., 10% reserve), the price would be lower: \\text{Price per ounce for 10% reserve} = \\frac{10 \\, \\text{trillion dollars}}{2.5 \\, \\text{billion ounces}} = 4,000 \\, \\text{dollars per ounce}.

# Conclusion

If all fiat money were monetized into silver, the price could rise to **$20,000–40,000 per ounce** based on current available above-ground silver. However, with additional silver recovery or a fractional reserve system, prices might stabilize lower, in the range of **$4,000–10,000 per ounce**.

  
lets sawy that happened how could one transact business, perhas grahms or miligrams?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

If silver were monetized and used for transactions in a global economy, the **price per ounce** would likely be so high that using full ounces would be impractical for everyday transactions. Instead, **smaller denominations** would be necessary, such as **grams** or **milligrams** of silver. Here's how this could work:

# Practical Units for Transactions

Given that the price of silver could rise to **$20,000–40,000 per ounce** (or higher), the value of a single ounce would be far too much for regular transactions. Smaller, more manageable units would be needed:

1. **Grams and Milligrams**:This makes it feasible to transact in **grams** or even **milligrams** of silver for smaller purchases.
   * **1 ounce of silver** = **31.1 grams**.
   * If silver is worth **$20,000/oz**, then:
      * **1 gram** would be worth approximately **$645** (20,000 / 31.1).
      * **1 milligram** would be worth approximately **$0.645**.
2. **Coins and Rounds**:
   * Silver coins or rounds could be minted in smaller units like **1-gram**, **5-gram**, **10-gram**, or **1-ounce** coins. These would allow for transactions to be more easily conducted without requiring fractional silver bars or ingots.
      * For example, a **1-gram coin** at $645 would be used for small purchases.
      * A **10-gram coin** (worth around $6,450) could be used for larger transactions.
3. **Digital Silver**:
   * Another practical solution would be the use of **digital silver** (e.g., silver-backed tokens or blockchain-based assets), where silver is stored in digital form and transactions occur via digital wallets. These systems would allow for very small fractional transactions (e.g., 0.01 grams or less) and avoid the need for physical silver exchange.
      * A **silver-backed digital token** could represent a gram or milligram of physical silver, allowing people to send and receive payments with micro-transactions.

# Transaction Examples

1. **Small Purchases**:
   * **Coffee or snacks**: If 1 gram of silver is worth $645, a simple transaction for a cup of coffee (let's say $5) could involve transferring about **0.0078 grams of silver** (5 / 645).
   * **Online purchases**: Smaller items could be priced in grams or milligrams, and fractional payments could be facilitated through digital platforms or physical coins.
2. **Larger Transactions**:
   * **Cars or homes**: These larger purchases could be priced in ounces, or even fractional ounces (e.g., 0.5 oz = $10,000–20,000). A buyer could make a transfer of **15–30 grams** of silver for a small car or **300–600 grams** for a home.

# Considerations for Daily Use

1. **Conversion to Fiat**:
   * People would likely still keep some fiat money on hand for small transactions, while using silver for larger investments, savings, or high-value exchanges.
   * A system of **silver-backed banknotes** or **tokens** could be developed, allowing easier and faster exchange of silver for goods and services.
2. **Silver as Savings or Wealth**:
   * For savings, individuals may accumulate silver in increments like **10, 50, or 100-gram bars**, which could be stored securely and used for larger transactions or investment.
3. **Government Regulation and Standardization**:
   * Governments could issue **official silver coins** with specific weights and purity (e.g., 1 oz, 10 grams) that would be widely recognized for trade.
   * A **centralized digital silver** system could help manage silver transactions while maintaining transparency and security.

# Conclusion

To transact business if silver were used as money, people would likely use **grams or milligrams of silver** for small purchases, and larger items could be priced in **grams** or **ounces**. Digital solutions could also facilitate easy, fractional silver payments, and a standard system of **silver-backed coins** would be key for practical, widespread usage. The overall transition would require a major shift in how currency, value, and transactions are understood, but with modern technology, it could be implemented effectively.

  
trump has mentioned returning to constitutional money

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Yes, former President Donald Trump has spoken in favor of **returning to ""constitutional money,""** a term often associated with the idea of using **gold or silver** as a standard of monetary value, as mandated by the U.S. Constitution. Specifically, the Constitution grants Congress the power to ""coin Money"" and ""regulate the Value thereof"" (Article I, Section 8). This phrase has been interpreted by some to suggest that the U.S. should return to a **gold or silver standard** rather than relying on fiat currency, which is not backed by tangible assets.

# Trump's Position on Constitutional Money

While Trump has not fully detailed a comprehensive plan for returning to a precious metal-backed currency, his comments on constitutional money have typically reflected a desire to **re-establish a sound money system** that would replace the current fiat currency model. Here are some key points that could align with his views on the subject:

1. **Revaluation of Precious Metals**:
   * Trump has hinted at the possibility of **gold or silver becoming a basis for the U.S. monetary system again**. Under a gold or silver standard, the U.S. dollar would be directly convertible into a specific amount of precious metal, ensuring a stable value tied to physical commodities rather than fluctuating market dynamics or central bank policies.
2. **Criticism of the Federal Reserve and Fiat Money**:
   * Trump has been outspoken in his criticism of the **Federal Reserve** and its monetary policies, especially its role in controlling interest rates and printing money. Advocates for constitutional money believe that returning to a gold or silver standard could help **curb inflation** and prevent reckless money printing.
3. **Populist Appeal**:
   * The idea of **constitutional money** has strong appeal among certain segments of the populist base, who view it as a way to restore financial sovereignty, reduce the power of the central banks, and return to a more stable and predictable economic system.

# Challenges of Returning to Constitutional Money

While the idea of returning to a **gold or silver standard** is appealing to some, it would present significant challenges:

1. **Practicality**:
   * **Gold and silver reserves** would need to be substantially increased to cover the **money supply**. As mentioned in previous calculations, if all fiat money were backed by silver, the price of silver would skyrocket, making it highly impractical for day-to-day use.
2. **Global System**:
   * The **global monetary system** is highly interconnected and operates on a fiat currency model, where most nations use paper money not backed by physical commodities. Shifting away from this system would require widespread international cooperation, which is a difficult and complex process.
3. **Flexibility of the Monetary System**:
   * A return to a precious metal standard would limit the **flexibility of central banks** to respond to economic crises (like recessions or depressions) through monetary policy tools such as adjusting interest rates or quantitative easing.
4. **Public Awareness and Infrastructure**:
   * A transition back to constitutional money would require massive public education and infrastructure changes, such as new systems for banking, payments, and currency exchange, to accommodate the use of precious metals in everyday transactions.

# How This Could Work

If the U.S. were to adopt a **gold or silver standard**, it could look something like this:

1. **Silver or Gold Coins**:
   * The U.S. government might mint **silver or gold coins** in smaller denominations for daily use. For example, **1-ounce silver coins** might represent $20 (if silver is priced at $20 per ounce) and be used for everyday transactions.
2. **Digital Silver or Gold**:
   * Digital assets or tokens backed by silver or gold could be used for **micro-transactions**. This would allow people to transact in smaller increments (e.g., fractions of a gram or milligram of gold/silver) even as the price of these metals rises.
3. **Full Backing of Currency**:
   * A **full monetary reset** might involve issuing a new currency backed by a specific amount of gold or silver, and each dollar would be redeemable for a fixed amount of that precious metal. The government would need to hold large reserves of the chosen metal(s) to make this feasible.

# Conclusion

Trump's mention of returning to constitutional money is part of a broader **critique of fiat currency** and a desire to return to a more stable, asset-backed system. While the idea has **historical and symbolic appeal**, the **practical challenges** of implementing a **gold or silver standard** are considerable. If silver or gold were adopted as the basis for U.S. money, it could drive significant demand for these metals, which might lead to extremely high prices. This transition would require extensive changes to the global financial system and significant economic adjustment.",1,1732513737.0,SilverSqueeze,0,1.0,False

This is especially needed, as 3 AM is a euphemism for censorship (part of Taylor's Unconscious's time based euphemisms). I Bet You Think About Me's censored lyrics make its real meaning unobvious.

==============

In this case, it makes it pretty obvious it is meant to be about the Cancer and his host. Thus, making it a [family of cancer](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sarkhana/comments/1fu1hbz/family_of_cancer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) song.

It seems to be the same cancer and host from Death by a Thousand Cuts

 

# I Bet You Think About Me's Background

 

The [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UMCrq-bBCg) makes it clear this is meant to be about a cancer and his host.

The lyrics are heavily censored, as implied by 3 AM (euphemism for censorship).

The red represents the cancer and his burning hatred.

The red drops in the drink represent the cancer's poisonous blood.

The cancer's scarf from All Too Well makes an appearance in the video.

The cancer destroying everything, due to his spite.

The flashbacks are shown with the mirror scene.

**Guy**

\[the guy thinks the ex-host of the cancer's true love 💗 was probably a better host, due to how pathetic the guy thinks he is\]

 

You left and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine

Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine

And the girl in my bed has a fine pedigree

And I'll bet your friend tells you she's better than me, huh

 

**Guy**

\[cancer is charming, so the guy's social circle loved him, while the cancer controlled him\]

 

Well, I tried to fit in with my upper-crust circles

Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love

Oh, they sit around talkin' 'bout the meaning of life

And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

 

**Unison**

\[they know that it is hard to forget things from the cancer remembering his human life\]

\[they think it is likely the other thinks about them\]

 

But now that we're done and it's over

I bet you couldn't believe

'Cause I know it's harder to forget than it is breathe

And I bet you think about me

 

**Cancer**

 

You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community

Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills

 

**Guy**

 

You were raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion

Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

 

**Guy**

 

But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for

And you and I fell like an early spring snow

But reality crept in, you said we're too different

You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

 

**Cancer**

\[reference to Mr Perfectly Fine; the narrator is the guy's ex from Death by a Thousand Cuts\]

\[cancer knows the guy is a mental wreck, being a simp, so cannot be truly happy\]

 

Mr. Always at the Right Place at the Right Time

Do you have all the friends that you need?

I don't have to be inside you to know that you'll never be happy

And I bet you think about me

 

**Unison**

 

I bet you think about me, yes

I bet you think about me

 

**Guy**

\[guy trying to move on\]

\[guy is slightly psychic from having the cancer's psychic power flowing through his mind for so long\]

 

Oh, block it all out

The voices so loud, sayin'

""Why did he let us go?""

 

**Cancer**

\[cancer wondering if the guy is sad he will never have as strong of a companionship as someone inside his mind all the time, due to his immense fear of lowliness\]

 

Does it make you feel sad

That the love that you're lookin' for

Is the love that you had

 

**Cancer**

\[cancer thinking about all the guy's flaws\]

\[cancer thinking the guy is trying to grow 🌱, hence searching for his soul\]

 

Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul

Scared not to be hip, scared to get old

Chasin' make-believe status, last time you felt free

 

**Unison**

 \[cancer's presence and hypnosis 😵‍💫 stops all the guy's social desire related character flaws\]

 

Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch

\[cancer goes to pick up his scarf from his human life, as a sentimental item\]

 

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold

I left my scarf there at my sister's house

And it's still got here in her drawer, even now

We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place

And I can picture it after all these days

That magic's not here no more

And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street

I remember it all too well

 

**Unison**

\[cancer's mother dated and enabled an abusive boyfriend\]

\[they either decided to kill the child, so as to not be burdened, or accidentally killed the kid during an abusive episode\]

\[cancer filled with hatred came back as a cancer and eventually killed his ex-mother\]

\[cancer thought it would be over once he killed his ex-mother, though it turns out the powers from wings of hatred are permeant, plus he was still filled with hatred for his mother\]

 

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed

And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team

She taught me 'bout her past, thinkin' her future was me

And she was tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""

 

Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town

And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now

He's gonna say it's love,"" she never called it what it was

'Til I was dead and gone and buried

 

Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same

After three months in the grave

And then you wondered where you'd go to as you killed her

But all you felt was hate and you held her lifeless frame

 

**Unison**

\[cancer does not like being remined of his human life\]

\[guy misses the cancer\]

 

And I know it's long gone and

There is nothing else left to do

And I forget about you long enough

To forget why I needed to

 

**Unison**

\[guy remembers the flashbacks in first person\]

\[the kid was killed by falling down the stairs\]

 

'Cause there I am again in the middle of the night

I'm dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light

Down the stairs, I was there

I remember it all too well

 

**Unison**

\[cancer leaves with the scarf, before anyone knows he was there\]

\[cancer vows to end humanity, using the guy's body\]

\[guy vows to aid the cancer, as he loves him\]

 

And there we are again when nobody had to know

I kept this as a secret, but I kept us like an oath

Sacred prayer and we'd swear

To remember it all too well, yeah

 

**Guy**

\[guy remembers a dramatic chase with the cancer\]

 

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much

But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up

Runnin' scared, I was there

I remember it all too well

 

**Guy**

\[cancer calls the guy from his new body\]

\[cancer hates lying, so is brutally honest about their relationship and his feelings for the guy\]

\[the guy cries in misery, even though he probably needed to hear it for his long term wellbeing\]

 

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise

So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest

I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here

'Cause I remember it all, all, all

 

**Cancer**

\[cancer feels guilt, as he is attached to the guy\]

\[attached in a ""he might be a pathetic loser, but he's my pathetic loser"" kinda way\]

\[guy says he might get better, if he grew 🌱 over time like the cancer for long enough\]

\[the statement makes the cancer feel guilty, as the guy is right that people can get better\]

 

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell

Every time you double-cross my mind

You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine

And that made me want to die

 

**Cancer**

\[cancer sheds a tear for the guy, presumably not very many\]

 

The idea you had of me, who was he?

A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine enlightens him

Not weepin' in a party bathroom

Some actress askin' me what happened, him

 

**Guy**

\[the guy's dad is happy with the cancer, thinking his son randomly decided to reform for the better\]

 

That's what happened, you

You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes

 

**Cancer**

\[cancer, being psychic can see the guy through walls\]

\[guy tries to stay up with coffee to avoid being asleep and getting flashbacks\]

\[guy looks at the front door, hoping the cancer will come back\]

 

Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show

But then I watched him watch the front door all night, willin' me to come

 

**Unison**

\[guy is turning 21, meaning he was pretty young when the cancer overtook him (makes him having many flaws with redeemable traits make more sense)\]

\[guy's dad has no idea why his son is miserable, as it seems completely out of nowhere\]

 

And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

 

**Unison**

\[guy paralysed by the heartbreak 💔\]

\[cancer paralysed by guilt\]

\[cancer thinks it would be nice to be loving again, though is out of practice being friendly; presumably only wants to be loving to his friends, as he still hates the average human\]

 

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it

I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it

 

**Guy**

\[guy mails back items the cancer bought, that he has no interest in, as they remind the guy of the cancer\]

 

After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own

Now I mail back your things and I walk home alone

I keep your old scarf from that very first week

'Cause it reminds me of innocence and it smells like me

\[cancer realises how well the guy remembers everything\]

 

He can't get rid of it

'Cause he remembers it all too well, yeah

 

**Cancer**

\[cancer figures out what the guy remembers, including how the cancer died\]

 

'Cause there he is again and he loves me so

Back before he lost the one real thing he's ever known

 

It was rare, I was there

He remembers it all too well

 

Wind in my hair, he is there

He remembers it all

 

Down the stairs, he were there

He remembers it all

 

It was rare, I was there

He remembers it all too well

 

**Guy**

\[guy has lost weight, as the cancer's psychic powers make him good at maintaining his weight e.g. he can go into a deep sleep for most of the day to skip meals\]

\[guy also loses weight due to not being able to eat, due to the heartbreak 💔\] 

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes

""I'll get older, but your hosts stay my age""

From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones

I'm a soldier who's returning half his weight

 

**Guy**

\[guy hopes the cancer misses him even slightly\]

\[guy knows the cancer's new city is cold, both literally and metaphorically (there is not a lot of companionship)\]

 

And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?

Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?

'Cause I know in your city's barren cold

 

**Unison**

\[they both remember visiting the cold city the cancer has moved to, together, so the cancer could figure out it was right for him\]

 

I still remember the first fall of snow

And how it glistened as it fell

I remember it all too well

Later, the guy has a new cancer enter his mind. Presumably due to the previous cancer getting attached to him.

The guy feels the cancer's presence, as he is slightly psychic from having the previous cancer's psychic power flowing through his mind.

The cancer loves having the guy around. They presumably have a more co-operative relationship, with them both being more proactive.

Thus a happy 😆 ending for the guy and the new cancer.

They also likely become a true love 💗 couple, so have Lover as a generic happy 😆 ending.

With clever [furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) choices and design strategies, even the coziest corners can exude sophistication and functionality. From compact living room pieces to versatile outdoor furniture, here’s how you can maximize your space while maintaining big style.

# 1. Embrace Multifunctional Furniture

When space is limited, every piece of furniture should work overtime. Look for options like ottomans that double as storage units or coffee tables that convert into desks. Multifunctional furniture not only saves space but also adds practicality to your home.

* **Tip:** A [two seater sofa](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/sofas) with built-in storage can be a game-changer for small apartments, offering both comfort and functionality.

# 2. Go Vertical with Storage

Think beyond traditional floor space by utilizing vertical storage. Tall bookshelves, wall-mounted shelves, and even floating nightstands can free up valuable floor space. Compact designs with clean lines also give the illusion of a larger room.

* **Style Suggestion:** Pair your furniture with light, neutral tones to make the space feel airy and open.

# 3. Maximize Outdoor Spaces

If you have a balcony or a small patio, outdoor furniture can expand your living area. Opt for compact yet stylish options like [rattan outdoor furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/rattan), which is lightweight, durable, and visually appealing. Modular seating can be rearranged to fit snugly in tight spaces while still providing enough room for entertaining.

* **Pro Tip:** Explore options at [outdoor furniture stores](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) for versatile pieces like foldable chairs and tables that can be easily stored when not in use.

# 4. Opt for Compact Seating

A **two-seater sofa** is the perfect choice for small spaces, offering ample seating without overwhelming the room. Pair it with a couple of accent chairs to create a cozy, intimate seating arrangement. Look for sofas with sleek silhouettes and tapered legs to create the illusion of more space.

# 5. Choose Light, Flexible Materials

Furniture crafted from light materials, like **rattan**, adds a breezy, open feel to small spaces. Rattan outdoor furniture, for instance, can also double as indoor decor, seamlessly blending function and style. Its natural tones and textures complement a variety of design themes, from bohemian to minimalist.

# 6. Think Modular

Modular furniture allows you to customize your layout to suit your space and needs. From sectional sofas that adapt to your living room’s configuration to extendable dining tables, modular options provide flexibility without compromising on style.

# 7. Mirrors and Lighting for Illusion

Strategically placed mirrors and proper lighting can make a small space feel larger. Combine reflective surfaces with well-placed furniture to create a sense of openness. Floor lamps and pendant lights add height and elegance without taking up much floor space.

# Conclusion: Big Style in Small Spaces

Compact living doesn’t mean compromising on style. By selecting the right furniture, such as a **two-seater sofa** or **rattan outdoor furniture**, and incorporating multifunctional pieces, you can transform even the smallest spaces into chic, functional havens. For a curated selection of stylish and space-saving options, visit **outdoor furniture stores** or explore versatile designs online.

Remember, it’s not the size of your space that matters—it’s how you style it!",1,1732513104.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False
1gzbs3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1gzbs3k/gaba_oxy_trouble_swallowing/,Gaba + oxy = trouble swallowing?,"I don't tend towards comparing symptoms as we all experience medications and combinations of medicines differently, but this is one if have been struggling with.

2700 gaba and 50 oxy daily for years. But now, maybe in the last year, I am having trouble swallowing liquids in particular.

No trouble with a soda bottle, but soup or stews. Or I tried a cough soothing herbal medicine on a spoon. Tea or coffee.

And I can't  tell if I am constantly choking and coughing because I am having trouble... or maybe at this point I have wrapped my head around an axel and am thinking about it so much it becomes a problem?

So, I feel like I am crazy about it at this point. And now I am developing an aversion to anything not in a thin necked bottle.

1gzbrmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stalking/comments/1gzbrmn/should_i_post_this_on_my_facebook_page/,Should I post this on my Facebook page?,"TW: Domestic abuse, mention of suicide, stalking etc.

I am wondering if I should post this on my private Facebook page. I did not name the person but people will know who I am talking about. I should also mention that despite having them blocked on all my social media accounts, I know they still do monitor some of my Instagram accounts (I have a public account as I use it for art so cannot make it private, they are blocked though). The reason I want to post it is mainly I want to help people in the same situation get out of it before they find themselves in the same situation I was in, but I guess I am afraid of repercussions. The world never seems to be in favour of the victim speaking out after all. Anyway, thoughts on sharing this? Thank you x



One year ago this week, I moved into my flat with the help of my best friend and my incredibly kind bosses. I was moving in an attempt to start a new life away from the most soul destroying relationship that I had ever been in in my life. One that started out pretty normal, but in hindsight, there were a lot of red flags right from the beginning. At the beginning I was told I was the most amazing beautiful girl he had ever met. His soul mate, the love of his life. He could not live without me. I had poetry written for me and we had so much in common. We even had the same pin numbers and codes to unlock our phones. He told me he thought we were ""meant to be."" I never wanted to rush into anything, but I always felt like he was rushing me to get to the next step in our relationship. He would stay at my house while I was at work, making my housemate uncomfortable, and eventually he moved into my house within a month of officially dating, to ""help me out financially."" He insisted on meeting my parents really early on even though at the time I wasn't comfortable with it. When he met my parents he lied to them about his drug habits, and told them that all he wanted to do was take care of me because I was the most amazing girl he had ever met.

At the same time I was constantly told that I was an insensitive and unempathetic person. That I was selfish and rude, and incapable of respecting another person's boundaries. I only cared about myself. Repeatedly yelled at for being ""deaf"" and ""fucking autistic"" when I misheard something or misunderstood something.  I was constantly lied to and had my phone looked through while I slept to 'test my honesty' later on. At one time I was woken up in the middle of the night and screamed at because he had gone through my phone and found messages to a friend about how I was thankful for a friendship I made with an ex partners 3 year old little girl. To him this meant I was 'not over my last relationship' and I had to delete all photos I had with her, which I did but it really upset me. I was so stressed from living like this, I was throwing up every night and had developed stomach ulcers and severe gastritis. My menstrual cycle was non existent throughout most of 2023 and he told me I had probably ""caught an STD from my ex that had made me infertile."" He was constantly trying to turn me against people close to me and got upset when I wanted to go out and do things with male work friends. He was always accusing me of flirting with male friends, and telling me that they wouldn't want to be just my friend anyway. I missed numerous events with friends because it would have been ""disrespecting his boundaries to go out."" I was shouted at and constantly told that I remembered situations wrong. Any argument was always ""made up for"" with gifts and promises to do better. Sometimes he just gave me money. He told me how  he got neglected as a child, bullied at school, cheated on in previous relationships, all an excuse as to why he acted the way he did. As his behaviour got worse and worse, it seemed like his reasons got worse as well. I felt sorry for him. He would pick arguments with me as soon as I woke up, and when I told him I had to go to work, he would tell me I was selfish and never cared about him or his needs. I'd be late constantly because he would tell me I didn't care about him if I just left him to go to work. On the occasions where I said I wanted to break up, he told me that without me he would kill themself. I felt like I was responsible for his life. Things weren't always horrible, some of the time it was good, and we had fun together. But it was like being on a rollercoaster. The lies were constant. And he couldn't keep any of the promises he ever made.

When I finally had the courage to leave he tried to convince me that I was having a ""borderline episode"" and I didn't know what I was doing. Living with him did make me feel like I was going insane, but I knew I didn't want to be with him anymore. He told me that if I broke up with him I would end up alone because both my parents would die, my friends would abandon me and no one would ever love me because I am a truly terrible, narcissistic person incapable of maintaining a relationship. That's what I deserved because I was such a selfish person that only loved myself and used people. The night my boss helped me move into my unit, I turned off my phone because he would not stop calling me. When I turned it back on later that night, he had sent me a photo of him standing on a ladder, about to hang himself. Later, he text me asking to pick him up from the hospital where the police had taken him - he really wanted a cigarette. 

I felt like what he did was my fault, but I did not want to be in a relationship with someone that treated me like that anymore. He said he would change, be better and stop lying but I didn't believe him. One night he came over to talk to me, but when I was firm on not getting back together, I walked him outside to his car and he put his face really close to mine and told me ""I still want to kill myself"" and told me that he'd take all of his valium and drive his car into a building if I made him leave. I made him come inside and messaged his mum to come pick him up but when he realised he called her and told her that I was lying and trying to make a drama. She came anyway and took him home. 

After this, I just worked a lot. I didn't have a lot of money and I didn't have a lot of furniture. I had a single lounge chair that I got at a garage sale for $15 that had a bunch of rosary beads in it by surprise and my bedroom had my bed and a taxidermy goat head. My tv didn't work so I spent a lot of time listening to music and watering my plants. I talked to my cat a lot. I didn't know if I could afford to live by myself but it was better than living like how I was living before. I'd get multiple calls and messages a day but I would mostly ignore them. My hair was falling out. Occasionally I would get home to weird little presents on my door step and it made me uncomfortable. Poems on sticky notes, rolled up cigarettes, old hair ties that I had left in his car. I didn't want to leave the house in case I saw him anywhere.

He messaged me incessantly. He would not give up on trying to 'fix' our relationship which I was serious about ending. He'd spam my phone with loving messages and apologies, telling me he'd change, he'd never treat me like that ever again. He'd blamed it all on his own 'acute mental health episode' or the fact he was abused as a child, although the culprit of the abuse kept changing. He called me repeatedly, sometimes leaving nice messages, sometimes abusive ones. Sometimes I'd just get poems at 2am. He tracked my location through different apps. When I'd tell him to leave me alone his attitude would change back to telling me that I was the crazy one, that I needed to get help, that I was sending mixed messages, telling me I was over reacting and convincing me that I was the abusive one in the relationship, that I was the reason he tried to kill himself because I just discarded him after he did everything for me. He told me that how I treated him during our relationship was domestic abuse. He told me he couldn't live without me. He told me we should just be friends because he didn't want to not have me in his life. He told me that he actually broke up with me, and I needed to get therapy if I wanted him to take me back? I tried to ignore it all. I'd tell him to stop over and over. But it lasted for months. I was afraid to leave my house. I wouldn't go grocery shopping alone anymore. I'd only drive to and from work, but if I saw a silver car I'd have a panic attack. I cried more than once most days and and I'd cry at work and in public if I went out with friends. I locked myself out of my own house 3 times in one week simply because I was so stressed. Chunks of my hair were falling out every day. I kept it all in a bag to take to my doctor. I lost 25kg in about 3 months. I stopped eating because I wasn't hungry anymore. I didn't sleep much because I would wake up frequently just to make sure my doors and windows were locked because when I moved in he off handedly told me this place would be easy to break into. I was so anxious I would spend hours just cleaning or rearranging my house. I would call my mother every day and cry. I didn't want to have a relationship with anyone ever again. I thought I'd just be alone forever.

I went home over Christmas to be with my family and the messages and calls did not stop. When I came back he had organised to swap some belongings that we still had of each other's. I had arranged for a friend to be with me on the day and told him to arrive at lunch time, but when the morning came, he showed up unannounced hours earlier and told me he was there early 'to get it over and done with for my own convenience.' But I knew by this point it was just because he had to be in control. I told him to go home and come back at the time we agreed. But he didn't leave. He sat outside my bedroom window and waited while I pretended I wasn't home. He told me to stop wasting his time. He called me a bitch for not letting him 'move on with his life' and 'drawing this out longer than it needed to'. I called my friend and asked her if she could come over earlier because he had arrived sooner than expected, and she did. When she arrived and I let her in and he realised I was inside the whole time, he said I was a lying psycho. He said I was being a control freak. When I went outside with my friend to see him with his things he was really friendly and told me how good I looked, and gave me late Christmas presents. A bunch of crystals and a plant. He made jokes and laughed and acted like he hadn't even been just sending me abusive messages over text. When he had all his stuff he asked if I wanted to get a coffee and breakfast with him. I said no. He said thank you for the sunshine and I miss you brown eyed girl, and I went inside. 

I went back to work after the Christmas break, and the messages continued. When I eventually blocked his number he moved to emails. His emails mostly didn't make much sense. One sounded like a missing persons report for me. I was going to my doctor frequently and she told me I had PTSD. One day I decided to contact his 'ex girlfriend' on Instagram to ask her some questions about their relationship, he had told me that she had randomly dumped him and blocked him out of no where and it had really messed him up and it really confused me so I wanted to know her side of the story. When I asked her, she told me that they had never actually dated, they were just friends and when she had not wanted to go out with him he wouldn't leave her alone so she ended up blocking him. When I learned this I kind of felt like maybe everything he had ever told me was a lie.

In mid February my friend came with me to file for a DVO with the police. I bought security cameras for my house which my boss installed. The night before he was served with the order he came to my house unannounced, let himself in my back yard while I was watering my plants and refused to leave for 45 minutes until I threatened to call my boss to come over. The next day he got served with the order and his mother sent me a message on Facebook saying she didn't appreciate the police scaring her daughter when they came to the door.

I didn't go to court when the DVO was put in place. I didn't want to see him ever again. I lost more weight and more of my hair fell out, but the messages, stalking and harrassment (for the most part) stopped after that. In April, I went home to visit my parents and old friend from school. On the way home I was driving through a storm, and while I was driving out in the middle of nowhere I put all my windows down and I cried. At first it looked like I was driving through a rainbow. It just made me want to cry and say everything that was on my mind, so I did. I had kept the crystals he gave me for Christmas in my door pocket since Christmas. When I was driving through the rain I threw them out the window along with the red mini key chain he had given me, and after that the rain stopped and there was a double rainbow. I stopped on the side of the road next to a random paddock and took a photo of it, I thought that was important somehow. 
 
I've now been in my unit for a whole year. I feel like a completely different person to the one that moved in here. I feel like the old me died and the new me can handle anything now. It took me until May to start leaving the house on my own again, and my sleeping is a lot better. My hair has mostly grown back. I started painting again. I hadn't done any painting for almost 2 years, and I didn't think I'd ever be inspired to do it ever again. I met a guy who became my best friend who really made me feel understood and gave me the confidence to be myself again. He's the nicest, kindest, most talented and most emotionally intelligent person I have ever met. He really encourages me to be my true self and I feel like I have all my creativity back again. He really appreciates me for all my weird quirks and helps me forget about how damaged I feel sometimes. I'm so glad he's my partner.

Even though I have trouble sometimes getting that stupid little voice out of my head, I know I'm not a selfish horrible person that doesn't deserve any love. I'm know I'm incredibly kind and caring, and really sensitive to other people's feelings and needs. I'm actually highly empathetic and genuinely a good person. I respect people's boundaries and I value honesty and loyalty. I'm not insufferable, and I'm not a 'deaf autistic bitch' that deserves to be yelled at by anyone. I can be blunt sometimes but I'd never make a joke to make anyone feel bad about themselves. I'm not controlling or jealous, although I can admit I probably was a bit when I was younger and immature. Most of all, I'm not a victim, and I'll never blame my actions on how someone else treated me in the past. I did not deserve any of the treatment during that 12 months and the stalking and harrassment afterwards either. 

I'm not sharing this to get sympathy or for people to feel sorry for me. I don't want anyone else that is going through the same thing that I did to feel like they deserve to be treated that that way, and that it's going to get better. Because no one that says they 'love you' will yell at you or try to control who you spend time with or how you think. They won't lie to you and it won't get better. I've been wanting to do something to help people effected by domestic violence for a long time now, and the first thing I think I can do is start talking about it because it's not the victims fault and they shouldn't feel guilty or ashamed to talk about what happened to them.",2,1732512992.0,Stalking,0,1.0,False

""In total, we were able to bring 74 U.S. Life Pods to safety, my Lady."" Lori said, flipping through her datapad to double-check their numbers. ""32 from the Queen's Resolve, 17 from the Therbidore, 9 from civilian vessels caught in the fighting, and the rest from the Reservists and Civil Defense Personnel who manned the Orbital Forts and shuttles."" She took a breath, it had been a long day already, thankfully Orions could imbibe coffee like their human compatriots! ""We have been receiving wounded at a steady rate from the Mars Incursion. Unfortunately, we also received some Varille in that weird cocoon."" She shrugged. ""Our security and Frim's Marines are stationed with them and remain on high alert, as ordered."" She finished the report. 


Gina had been right. She had told her that the only way not to feel helpless was for her to roll up her sleeves and do what you *can* do. Lori had understood and after her mother-in-law assured her she more than had the children covered, had rushed to help the other Orions working hard to assist their allies fighting valiantly in the void of space, for all Sol system. 


""Good,"" Tarra said. ""Have Commander Ovran report his findings as soon as he returns. I want to know *why* the President has refused my request."" She had been furious when President Owlan had refused to allow her to accompany him to meet this Captain Barbara Thornton on Earth. The woman and her crew deserved to be thanked just like everyone else had been. More so by Tarra's line of thinking, after all, she had never been thanked personally by Tarra for even allowing them through that FTL Gate. The Regent had been taking great pains to contact the surviving ships and crews to relay the Orion's thanks, after all, Frim Habitat was the only home the Orions had currently and it wasn't like it could be moved easily out of the Sol system. Except for the Refuge, and her valiant crew which included roughly half its numbers as Orions. 


Lori watched her Regent flick a shredded stress ball into the waste bin and withdraw another from her desk. Her sharp red-painted nails extending and retracting as she continued to fume over the president's abrupt refusal to take her with him. ""As you command, my Lady."" 


She made the note and set a reminder in her data chit. ""We also received this request, unfortunately, I was on maternity leave my Lady, so I am not quite sure when it arrived."" She handed a rolled parchment she had found sitting on her desk when she had arrived. The seal stamped into the wax was the tri crowns of the Orion hegemony bisected by two tuardanium rapiers in the shape of a ""V"". The insignia was only used by Vatt's ruling family the Liam's. 


""Regent Jaqu Liam of Vatt still wants me to step down as Regent of Frim?"" Tarra asked, her voice holding a dangerous edge to it. Lori handed the scroll to her Regent and stepped back, averting her eyes.


""I don't know my Lady. It has the noble family's insignia and is addressed to you."" Lori bowed slightly, waiting for her Regent to read the message. Antiquated as it was, it must have been important for Regent Jaqu Liam to go through the trouble of procuring a roll of parchment to write it on. 


""Oh..."" Tarra's voice seemed to change from furious to curious as she broke the seal and began to read its flowing Orion script. ""Oh my, this was unexpected.""


Lori waited patiently for her Regent to continue. She was surprised as Tarra handed her the scroll and said, ""Read it, tell me your thoughts, and be honest with me please Lori.""


Lori took it and carefully read its contents twice before audibly sighing. ""Well my Lady, it looks like we're not going to have a choice. Frim Habitat is the designated home of the Orion species now, as stated in the agreement you signed with the Senate on behalf of Farcee's refugees, and you the acting Regent of Frim."" She swallowed hard as she read the next part. ""And because of this, and your diligent work to ensure our people's future, I, Regent Jaqu Liam have no other option but to recognize you, Regent Tarra of Frim as the new Matriarch. She..."" Lori looked up in surprise as she finished. ""will be arriving tomorrow to recognize you formally as such and she will be bringing the rest of the Orion refugees with her. All of them."" Tarra had a wary look now, her eyelids half closed, her green eyes flashing in the light as she shifted in her chair.


""Alright, have Durll prepare a small welcoming ceremony, and get some help finding space for some of the new Orion refugees. It took them a long time to reach us. Start with willing den sisters to take in those Orions who have no one, those who have family prioritize the empty living quarters. Talk to Mitchell and see if we can convert section 4J-4P into new living quarters. If I remember the last briefing he had said the mining crews had nearly completely harvested the ore from its veins."" Lori nodded, she remembered that report, she had been surprised they had made such progress in the upper levels of the asteroid so quickly. 


But Regent Tarra had been pushing everyone to work hard to make their new home the best they could make it. And so far the support from the Orions had been tremendous. Lori couldn't ever remember their people working so hard toward a single goal. Survival, and proving their worth to the other U.S. Alliance member species, especially the humans who had so graciously given them refuge in their cradle system. Not many species would have. And the surviving Orions remembered all the supposed ""allies"" that had refused to help them when they had found themselves in need. There would be many more survivors if that had been the case.


She made the note in her data chit with a ""Yes, my Lady."" And waited for her Regent to continue.


""Once they arrive, I want all the nobles assembled,"" Tarra said. Lori grimaced but nodded. Back on Farcee that would mean Regent Tarra was about to commit a purge of the upper classes to ensure loyalty through her reign as Monarch. But Lori also knew they didn't have the number of people they once had. The loss to their genetic pool could be catastrophic at this time. ""I also want a list of potential nobles. The criteria needs to be they need to have achieved something for the Orion people. Not for themselves."" Tarra finished, she raised her left hand, dismissing Lori with a sincere, ""Thank you, Lori. I'm so glad you could help today. I'm afraid I've been running the other retainers ragged lately.""


""My Lady, it's my pleasure to serve you, and our people."" Lori responded, blushing at the sincerity in her Monarch's voice. ""I *needed* to help... somehow. I couldn't just watch anymore."" 


""Are you sure those cubs are fine?"" Tarra asked, she had acted like an overprotective aunt since the children's births. She had even been the one to commission a craftsman on earth to make the custom wooden blocks with both English and Orion letters painted on them. Tim had called it a magnificent gift. 


""They are with their fathers Matriarch, my Lady. I'm sure they're just fine."" She smiled. She didn't think there was much of anything Gina couldn't handle, and her grandchildren's well-being seemed to be at the very top of her list. 


""Well, just don't overdo it, Lori. I appreciate you coming in to help, but you're technically still on maternity leave."" She gave Lori a warm smile and Lori made her way out. She went to her desk and sat her datapad down, she picked up the picture of Tim that sat on the corner next to her nameplate and absently rubbed the wooden frame as she looked out the window in her office at the Shuttles and Corvette's ferrying people from the surface of Mars to Frim. It was the only fully functional medical unit left operational after that big EMP burst. Everything else was pretty much running on antiquated methods. Most of Mars's power stations had been knocked off the grid. And those still active were dealing with overloaded systems. 


She looked at the view screen tuned into the same GAL NET News cast she had been watching in her apartment with Gina. A headline scrolled across the bottom of the screen reading, ""Varille invasion thwarted on Mars! Sol system is Safe! Victory at Eorderian! JanXal still holds!""  


She sat the picture back down and retrieved the data pad, and activated her personal data chit. ""Send a message to Skree. Tell her we need the complete remaining genealogy records of Farcee. All of them."" She waited for the""Sent"" alert and then continued. ""Message Commander Ovran. Inform him Regent Tarra wishes to know what his investigation turned up as soon as possible."" She sighed.


The confirmation beeped and she pressed the call contact: Durll on the screen. 


Might as well get started on the ceremony. As soon as the genealogical files were sent over they would need to start finding those willing den sisters. She looked back at the picture of Tim and a thought struck her. 


How would Tim feel about her taking in one or two den sisters? Something she would have to ask Gina about later she decided as she heard Durll's husky feminine voice.

""Hello, Lori."" She said. ""How's those cubs of yours and that handsome catch you married doing?""


""Great as far as I know Durll. Regent Tarra needs us to...""


~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~


Jack Jackson had seen a lot of things in his 27 years. Some quite remarkable or unbelievable. But the visions he was getting from Zava were truly fantastical. She was apparently going through some sort of trial in her mind. All of them were if what Grijjeki had said was true for the rest of the Varille who had suddenly cocooned themselves like Zava and Orilanna. They had barely made it through the curtain when it had happened to both of them.


""Why is she running through a crystalline cave?"" He heard himself ask. ""It looks like she's having trouble.""


""I dunno."" Grijjeki shrugged his shoulders and took another pull off his beer. ""But Orilanna is there too, Ariel is somewhere else, I sense danger but she's blocking me. I heard Orilanna say something about getting to a Nexus. Must be trying to do the same thing. They don't seem to be having as difficult a time of it as your Zava seems to be though by what you're saying.""


""It doesn't worry you at all?"" Asked Jack, he reached over and covered Roger with his silk blanket. 


""Well, it does. But worrying about it won't help anyone. And sharing that worry with them while they are going through this probably won't help either."" He motioned with his beer bottle at Jack and Zava's children and continued. ""Try sending her a mental image of them as they are. You might be surprised.""


He tried it, imprinting the image in his mind and ""sending"" it to Zava as well as what he thought was support for her. He hoped it was support and not worry but he wasn't sure he succeeded.


""Well, anyways you look tired so I'll let you get some rest. The couch is yours. Make yourself at home. I gotta go check on the wounded and make sure the captives are still ok."" He stood and turned at the door. ""I'm glad to see you're doing well Jackson. I always pegged you for being the family type. I'll see you for breakfast. Catch some rest while you can."" He sat the empty bottle on an end table and walked out the door, taking the slug thrower with him.


""Yeah, like that's going to happen while I have to watch as Zava works her way through this and all I can do is sit here and watch."" He said under his breath. He finished his beer and stood to dispose of it, grabbing Grijjeki's on the way. He passed a small shrine where Grijjeki's mom was lighting incense around. He could see Zava making her way through what looked like a corridor with many sharp crystalline protrusions. He could feel her carapace scraping them as she worked her way through them.


He threw the bottles in the waste bin and made his way to the window. It was dark and with the electricity in most of the suburbs being spotty at best this building seemed to be running on a separate power source. So it was dark, the only lights in the distance from this vantage point were from the Varille drop ship. There had been heavy fighting near it shortly after the Varille had gone into their cocoons. They had seen multiple shuttles heading for it a couple of hours ago. The Marines must have secured the area around the ship and called for reinforcements before breaching the hull and engaging the enemy. 


He could make out flashes of light here and there, and off in the distance, a large fire raged. He hoped that wasn't the forest. He remembered donating credits while he was in school to help plant those much-needed trees. It had been rather easy to warm Mars for the first couple of generations of colonists. The hard part had been getting the actual Flora and Fauna established. A lot of stewardship had been put into creating all different types of life forms that now called Mars home. Several of them couldn't survive except in certain very specific circumstances unique to the engineered Martian climates.


He reached into his pocket and pulled out his father's old service metal. The only thing he had left of his family. And back out the window. He had been a warrior. He looked back into the living room, to his plasma caster sitting on the table. Then down to his children, snuggled up together in a pile. Then to the curtain leading to where Zava's cocoon was. 


""What am supposed to do?"" He asked the room. He closed his eyes and was immediately with Zava. ""Why me?"" He groaned.


""Because the creator deemed you worthy."" Came Grijjeki's mom's clipped tone, as if scolding a child. ""A man does not complain about the fate he has been dealt. A life without struggle has no substance."" She pointed at his children. ""You have been blessed. Though you can't see it now, you have been given a great gift."" She turned to walk through the curtain to the room holding the Varille woman and paused at the threshold. ""You should thank the Creator for what you have and not lament what you lost to get such blessings. But I'm just an old woman."" She disappeared, leaving him to think about her words.


He didn't know how long he stood there, the grey streaks of morning light had begun spreading across the horizon when Zane started to fuss, and he finally snapped out of it. He picked him up and gently shushed him while bouncing back and forth from foot to foot. Looking into his son's bright blue eyes suddenly he knew exactly what he needed to do. He sat on the couch, still rocking Zane, who was sucking on his thumb when he closed his eyes again. He had to try to help her, somehow.


He didn't even notice he fell asleep.


~ He could see her, she had made it through the crystalline labyrinth, her carapace cut and bruised, orange-colored blood smeared with a reddish clay. Now she stood before a wall of twisting helixes flashing through various light spectrums at seemingly random intervals. The chamber contained a large brazier of fire on one side with oddly colored blue flames and an equal-sized bowl of water. Though it wasn't clear, it was milky for some reason even though he *knew* it was water.


Off to his right Zava quickly approached the wall, limping, determination etched on her beautiful all-to-human face, and pressed certain parts of the glowing helixes as they lit up. He *sensed* that she understood the puzzle almost immediately. In only moments she managed to solve it, causing a section of wall to swing open revealing a very bright room beyond. He could hear many voices whispering. Unfortunately he couldn't catch what they were saying. 


Zava looked at the doorway and took a deep breath. He could feel herself forcing her mind to calm down as excitement welled up in her. ""I will not fail. I am Zava, of the Jackson colony. I will embrace my future without resignation or fear. I know my true enemy and she shall ***NOT*** prevail!""


With that, she charged through the doorway. Jack could feel it. Determination was etched into her very being. She would complete this ""test"" and seize her future with their children and him, or die trying. ~


He snapped awake, Grijjeki was gently shaking his shoulder and full-on sunlight was filtering through the window curtains. Zane still cradled in his arm, head resting on his chest. He immediately looked for Emma, Kryss, and Roger. Seeing them crawling around on the floor playing with each other and a small inflated ball, safe and sound by the thoughts he was picking up from them, he relaxed.


""It's time for some breakfast. Come on, these little ones aren't big enough yet to shovel it in. I know that much at least."" He slapped Jack on the back before heading to the kitchen area, throwing a towel over his shoulder as he went. ""And I figured you wanted to know, we've won."" Grijjeki gestured towards the window but Jack could already hear lots of air traffic outside. Zane stirred and he placed him on the floor with his siblings as he went to retrieve some breakfast. 


He stopped and looked at the curtained doorway for a moment. He could *feel* that Zava was alright, he couldn't tell what she was doing, but she was just fine. He looked back at the kids crawling around on the floor and rolling the ball between each other. ""Let's get some breakfast."" He smiled as he walked into Grijjeki's kitchen, the smell of scrambled eggs had his mouth-watering and the kids could most likely eat it at this stage, he would just have to smash them up really well. 


""That didn't take long."" He said as Grijjeki handed him a plate. ""Wonder who ended up bagging their leader?"" 


""Well, I heard through the grapevine that we knew the Varille would have some sort of *reaction* during the attack, it's said that at JanXal system it was the only reason they managed to fight them to a stalemate. And only after the Varille affected had been separated from their buddies that hadn't been."" Grijjeki shrugged scrapping a healthy helping of scrambled eggs on Jack's plate. ""So somebody gave us some good Intel.""


Jack remembered Zava saying something about helping the Alliance in exchange for her assurances under pain of death for her freedom and in extension his, and he caught himself looking at the curtain as he absently sat on Grijjeki's floor cross-legged, smashing scrambled eggs and feeding them to his kids. He closed his eyes and tried his best to see what she was doing but only got a bright light, so he settled for sending her what he hoped was the equivalent of an ""all is well message"".

I do intermittent fasting (I  eat dinner at 9 PM) & try to maintain healthy eating habits. Here's my schedule:

Wake up around 8 AM  
Goes for a walking / Cross trainer around 10 AM  
Comes home at 12 PM

Black Coffee without sugar at 5 PM and 2 sugar-free biscuits Dinner between 8-9 PM - 1 bowl of cooked white rice, 3 whole boiled eggs, 1 small bowl of lentils soup & 3 slices of white bread. After dinner, I go for a walk in a nearby park for 5k steps (10K at the gym & 5k at the park)

I make sure to drink 3 liters of water every day. I am also taking L-carnitine supplement half an hour before going to the gym.

The last two times I pulled espresso, I noticed that as I am using my WDT to prep the puck I find a couple of whole beans in a mix with my ground espresso. They are also a new bag that I just opened up as well.

All of them turn out very heavy and dense despite seeming to pass the poke test and have many bubbles surfacing after proofing on the counter for 4-6/7 hours (it varies but I usually skip the fridge part due to convenience and timing).

My latest loaf was a double chocolate loaf. 500g flour, 100g coffee and 50g cocoa powder, 300g water or so, 75g brown sugar, vanilla extract and salt. I did 3 stretch and folds and let rise afterwards from 1pm until 7pm ish. The dough had risen about double and had bubbles, was jiggly, and when poked the spot stayed. I did not put in fridge. Baked at 425 in Dutch oven lid on the entire time for about 50mins to an hour (I like a softer crust). See photo below for result. 

I’m unsure why my loaves keep turning out so dense and heavy, they’re tasty, however, I feel as though something is going wrong somewhere in the process. Wondering if I’m perhaps over proofing despite good rise in the oven still during baking. Thoughts?

he kept asking why, begging for another chance, and when i didn’t give in, he got angry. i blocked his number, blocked him on social media, and thought that was the end of it. but it wasn’t.

it started with him showing up at places he knew i’d be. my favorite coffee shop, the gym, even my work parking lot. at first, i thought it was just a coincidence, but it’s happened too many times now to just be chance. he doesn’t even always approach me—sometimes he’ll just stand there, staring, and it makes my skin crawl.

last week, i came home from work and found a note on my car windshield. it was from him. it wasn’t threatening, but it was unnerving. he wrote about how he missed me, how he knew we were “meant to be,” and how he just needed me to “see it.”

i don’t know what to do. i’ve told friends, and some of them are telling me to go to the police, but what if they don’t take me seriously? what if he just gets angrier?

i hate that this is happening. i hate that i feel scared to go out or even to stay home alone. it’s like he’s taken over my life, and i can’t escape him.

i just wanted to vent somewhere because i feel so helpless. i’m trying to stay strong, but it’s hard when you don’t feel safe in your own skin.",1,1732510144.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1gzayhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/1gzayhe/tips_for_feeding_people_this_season/,Tips for Feeding People this Season,"Hey everyone, this time of year is pretty rough for our homeless friends so I thought I’d make a list of some tips and suggestions to keep in mind. I’ve been doing this since 2020 and here are some of my tips for keeping people warm and fed.

Feeding the homeless in winter is vital for providing both nourishment and comfort during the harshest months. Here are some tips for planning and carrying out an effective and compassionate effort:

1. Focus on Warm, Nutritious Meals

	•	Hot Soups and Stews: These are easy to prepare in bulk, filling, and provide much-needed warmth.
	•	Proteins and Carbs: Include items like chili, rice, pasta, or casseroles to help sustain energy levels.
	•	Warm Drinks: Offer coffee, tea, hot chocolate, or warm cider to combat the cold.

2. Prioritize Easy-to-Eat Foods

	•	Consider those without access to utensils or a place to sit. Handheld items like sandwiches, burritos, or packaged snacks work well.
	•	Avoid items that can freeze (like fresh fruits) or spoil quickly.

3. Include Cold-Weather Necessities

	•	Provide thermal blankets, gloves, socks, and hats alongside meals when possible.
	•	Hand out hand warmers and travel-sized hygiene kits, including lip balm and lotion for dry skin.

4. Plan for Food Safety

	•	Use insulated containers or portable warmers to keep food at the right temperature.
	•	Prepackage meals in disposable, eco-friendly containers for easy distribution.

5. Choose Convenient Locations and Times

	•	Set up in areas where homeless individuals commonly gather (parks, shelters, or transit hubs).
	•	Schedule meal distributions during colder parts of the day, such as evening hours, when temperatures drop.

6. Collaborate with Local Organizations

	•	Partner with shelters, soup kitchens, or churches that may already have established programs.
	•	Coordinate with city officials to avoid overlap or potential conflicts.

7. Build Relationships

	•	Offer a warm smile and conversation—acknowledging someone’s humanity is as important as the meal.
	•	Ask for dietary preferences or restrictions if you can accommodate them.

8. Stay Consistent

	•	Regular efforts are more effective than one-time events. Creating a predictable schedule helps people know when and where to find support.

9. Seek Community Support

	•	Organize a donation drive for warm clothing, blankets, or food items.
	•	Recruit volunteers to cook, distribute, or donate supplies.

10. Be Mindful of Your Own Safety

	•	Work in groups, especially during evening distributions.
	•	Maintain a calm, respectful demeanor and avoid high-conflict areas if safety is a concern.

Some people still don’t have their power restored. I work in a grocery store and we had to toss thousands of dollars of perishable goods that could not be saved/stored on a refrigerated trailer sent from the warehouse. So you can already imagine the mayhem I experienced.

Fortunately, I live in a small grid that never loses power even in such an extreme storm but I was also the only person in a 10 mile radius from Grandma’s house that still had electricity. Half of my family lives very close (anywhere between 5 to 15 minute drive from each other). But Friday, I told a couple coworkers I’m close with that I won’t host my family in bad storms after this one and ended it with, “Natural disasters bring out the best qualities in people but you also see the worst sides of them as well.”

Here is why I don’t want to host my family anymore in my 850 square foot apartment:

1.) The first night of the power outage, my mom came over to charge her phone so she would be able to contact people (I’ll admit that I was even having a hard time communicating with people and figured cell phone towers nearby were down) and set an alarm for work. Since she always has bluetooth on, her battery trains quickly. I didn’t mind that. While she was sitting in my living room, I was in the process of cooking a fillet of salmon, pasta, and peas for dinner, give some salmon to my cat as a treat, and have a couple meals leftover. My mom made a comment that she didn’t know what she was going to do for dinner because she had no power and the few places that were open were PACKED with cars of people trying to get food and Grandma was out at my uncle’s house who had power. I had more than enough food I was cooking and I told mom to stay for dinner so she didn’t have to try to fight lines for food. Mom looked at me and the salmon and said, “I’m not in the mood for salmon.” On a normal day, I wouldn’t mind but I told her, “You don’t have power and you won’t have to fight lines for food. Beggars can’t be choosers in the situation you’re in.” The next day, I expressed that I was offended that she came over, complained about not knowing what she was going to do for dinner, and then turned one down.

2.) The next day, I invited my family (brother, SIL, niece, cousin, and mom) over for dinner and if they needed to charge their phone or wanted a hot cup of coffee or a hot shower then they are more than welcome to help themselves. My brother accepted my invitation only to call me IMMEDIATELY afterwards saying, “I’m bringing my pet lizard over for you to take care of or he will die. You’re doing this and you can’t say no.” I tried telling him that I would never turn down taking care of his pet and keeping it warm for the time being as I understand not wanting your pet to die under any circumstances but he can’t approach me like a presumptuous AH about it and that he still needs to ask me since I live in a place that is not legally mine. My brother lost his mind over my explanation to why I felt so irritated over it. It was never about taking care of the lizard. It was his approach. Not only that, I told him 10 minutes prior to him arriving that he needed to take his shoes off when he gets here because I spent some time cleaning the floors and they’re not the easiest to clean. He didn’t do that but everyone else did and I never walk in my own place with shoes on. I felt like he was disrespecting my wishes.

I tried explaining both of these to several close people outside of the family and I got mixed reactions. Half of those people said I was justified in why I felt the way I felt but the other half said I was overreacting since they were in need of some help and my BF said that I needed to “come to my senses”.

So, I guess I’m just looking for some outside perspective. Did I overreact?",1,1732508998.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.67,False

2 years since I’ve gone on a date. I graduated from a school with 65% males, so dating was difficult. Regardless, I got a few good conversations that led to women saying they want to meet for coffee, etc. When the time comes - no show, “I was at work and forgot,” or ghosted.

I’m  nice and caring for that person while they are kind to me aswell. But sometimes I’m so nice to them but they say something which is disrespectful and rude, yet they apologize. But deep down I feel like that is constantly happening to me. I’ve tried not talking to her while at work to avoid my feeling from getting hurt, but I feel this heavy burden when I’m mad at her. And the worst part is she doesn’t even ask me if I’m okay or try to talk to me, i know she respects me and wants to leave me alone if I’m not talking to her. However she is the cause 90% of the times for me being mad and not wanting to talk to anyone at work, because she effects my mood. I think I give but don’t get the same energy back which I crave which turns into anger and frustration—because she doesn’t care and has told me if someone is not nice to me I won’t be nice to them. But why do ive be the one who asks every time, “what happen or what’s wrong r u mad?” Then after that she would go from having a grumpy face even though I was the one who was mad. I’m asking her why she is mad, she would respond by saying nothing I just wanted to give you space if because I thought you were mad. 

She is very nice person and care for people and she has told me plenty of times when I had mentioned she was pretty rude to me at times. She goes on by saying, I’m very sorry if I said anything mean to you, I don’t think sometimes. Which is okay but why do I have to break the ice every time because I’m a guy ? And if I don’t talk to her she won’t talk to me maybe she has ego and she is arrogant (because I know she is prolly thinking if this guy doesn’t wanna talk that’s fine with me). However my biggest challenge is the pain that I feel for not talking to her because I know I’m mad and I try to keep the conversation relating to work only otherwise we would be talking about all sorts of things. I’ve learnt a lot from her and she gets the big out of me but the worst out of me too. I still have feeling for her and  and know she sees me as a very good friend but I’m hurt every day encountering such behaviour. Someday are fantastic but other my moods swing 10 times a day because I have trouble understanding her. How can someone go from being so nice to being arrogant? Maybe I’m mad at her that’s why, but only because you did what you did ? If I’m being honestly this pain is soooo bad that unless I cry it out after work I feel a sharp thumbing pain in my head. I wish I could leave this job but I can’t. I won’t say she is a bad person but super kind and I’ve always treated her nicely except this one time I didn’t talk to her for 2 months after getting my feelings hurt cuz she told me she didn’t feel same about me but I respect you a lot and she said you shouldn’t like me I’m toxic this and that but I stuck my brain is stupid.. please advice what I should do if I talk to her I’m in pain for knowing something I shouldn’t know and if I don’t talk to her then also I feel hurt for avoiding her and in return she won’t bother to ask what’s wrong. She does care about me i know but sometime it feel fake. She would tell me something like I’m gonna go drink coffee and id say you shouldn’t cuz you have stomach problem and sometimes I’d even say I’m disappointed in a funny way but then she would think I’m saying something wrong, but I’m trying to help her not make things worse. God know what’s up with her or me. Sometimes I feel that it’s me how has mood swing and she effects me all the time because if little things. And in turn I stop speaking to this other guy who is nothing but nice to me. I feel bad for this other dude who tries to make me laugh when I’m sad not knowing it because of her but I just feel so hurt and I would fake smile and go along but inside I’m broken every time.

He's honestly one of the nicest people I've ever met and we just connect. Lately, we've been hanging out almost every day. Sometimes with other people and sometimes one-on-one. We go on long walks together, text throughout the day and it feels like we can talk about anything, both silly and deep. He also does sweet things for me, like bring me the coffee I like or my favorite snacks. In general, he's a wonderful person and I'm super lucky to have him in my life. He's also very attractive (probably out of my league) and I've developed a (not so small) crush on him. I don't want to ruin our friendship by saying anything, but also want to gauge if he might be interested as I think we'd be really good together. Do you guys think he likes me/ should I shoot my shot? If it helps, he does have other friends that are girls, but no one he's as close to or spends time one-on-one with like we do. Thanks in advance!

I’m  nice and caring for that person while they are kind to me aswell. But sometimes I’m so nice to them but they say something which is disrespectful and rude, yet they apologize. But deep down I feel like that is constantly happening to me. I’ve tried not talking to her while at work to avoid my feeling from getting hurt, but I feel this heavy burden when I’m mad at her. And the worst part is she doesn’t even ask me if I’m okay or try to talk to me, i know she respects me and wants to leave me alone if I’m not talking to her. However she is the cause 90% of the times for me being mad and not wanting to talk to anyone at work, because she effects my mood. I think I give but don’t get the same energy back which I crave which turns into anger and frustration—because she doesn’t care and has told me if someone is not nice to me I won’t be nice to them.

Tonight I got stood up at a local bar after moving across the country. 8th in a row.

2 years since I’ve gone on a date. I graduated from a school with 65% males, so dating was difficult. Regardless, I got a few good conversations that led to women saying they want to meet for coffee, etc. When the time comes - no show, “I was at work and forgot,” or ghosted. 

I am now suspicious of kindness, and it really, really sucks. Enter dating apps, and there is no difference in behavior, if not worse.

One time a girl said she’d play volleyball with me and her friends. Ghosted me + texted “I’m out of town right now”, and that night I locked eyes with her at the bar. F*ck that hurt. 

I, M23 am not an ugly dude. Yeah, I don’t have the veneer-white perfect smile or the look of that one guy from fight club, but I sit a little over 5’10, 170lbs, and a mere 12% body fat (thanks gym scale). 

I’ve got a full-time job that I love, an apartment roof over my head, and things have been going my way. I’ve worked very, very hard to get here, but now I feel like I will never be loved by anyone except my mother and brother. ",29,1732508644.0,dating_advice,46,0.98,False

Some current items :

\-Coffee Mug  for $335.00

\- Tarot Cards for $114.00

\- A paper fan for 54.00

\-Shel Silverstien's ""The giving tree"" - $98.00

  
Absolutely no shade to the business ( the owner is actually very sweet ) or  whomever is buying these things but- I am so curious to know if locals are creating the demand for this or if it's tourists spending like sailors.

So far its works fine when i turn it on. Will it survive even if I dont seek professional help? Also how long till I can open my laptop again? 

I also search up online that F15 Tuf is spill-resistant??? So does that mean it has a higher chance of surviving since only my keyboard was affected? Please help. Thanks so much. ",1,1732508326.0,Asustuf,0,1.0,False
