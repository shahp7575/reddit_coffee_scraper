***DATE: APRIL 19******^(TH)******, 7 A.U. (AFTER UNIFICATION)***  
***LOCATION: SOL SYSTEM, ABOARD UTRN INDOMITABLE WILL***

**LIEUTENANT PAUL KARST**

“Follow me, everyone.” Henry beckoned as the last of their entourage, Jenkins, stepped out of his Paladin suit.

Paul smirked as Jenkins struggled to free his boot from the suit in his haste to catch up to the group.

“Hang on, guys!” Jenkins called out.

""Then keep up, loser!"" Paul called back.

Henry shot him a glare, which Paul promptly ignored as Alvarez arrived in the gunship bay armory.

“Captain! Good to see you back with us. What happened in there?” Alvarez asked.

Henry took a moment to consider his words before he spoke.

“They told us a bunch of information that, if true, is going to permanently change our mission outlook. Before we go spreading the word around anywhere, or making plans based upon it, we need to verify their claims. They offered us a deal that we should probably take *if* we can determine they were telling the truth.” Henry said.

“That's awful cryptic, sir.” Alvarez replied.

“Yeah, I know. This happens to be a nuclear fucking bomb of a secret, I'm afraid. I will fill you in on everything once I can get to the CIC and we figure this all out. ” Henry replied.

“I don't like it, but it is certainly understandable. The crew has been restive in your absence, but we held discipline well overall.”

""What happened?"" Paul asked. Alvarez looked back towards him.

""I... I'll wait til we get to the CIC where I can show you. I think that would be best."" Alvarez replied cryptically.

Paul snorted and shook his head.

""Let's be on our way then."" Henry replied before he led the group to the quick lift.

One by one, the group grabbed a loop on the downward tether to head into the CIC. As his turn to exit came, Paul grabbed at the padded bar around the door to swing himself around off the cable and onto the deck. The officer of the watch turned to see the large group incoming and turned to call out.

“Captain on deck!” A cheer arose from the crew, Henry played to his crowd with graciousness, shaking hands and exchanging greetings until he made his way to his station by the systems map on the upper level of the CIC.

“Fleetwide directive, Thank you for holding the line and keeping your cool. We can report a successful first contact with the Alderei. We are in talks now, with the prospect of normalized peaceful relations on the table!” Another cheer arose from the crew.

“We will begin round two discussions tomorrow. While everything appears to be going well, it would be highly unwise to let our guards down. Drone flight rotations are to continue at quarter deployment saturation, we will be keeping those C.L.A.P.P.E.R rounds hidden for now, and we will maintain our defensive screen. Just because we had a promising outcome does not mean we bare them our backs to be stabbed. Stay alert, but not paranoid, we don’t expect trouble but we should be prepared for it. Well done, each and all of you, Humanity is proud of us today.”

Again, more applause. *What a ham.*

***… you are jealous… a worthless and ignoble emotional state... your skills differ... as does your responsibilities... comparison is pointless...***

*Stay OUT of it.* Paul replied mentally.

After he shut down the comms app, Henry beckoned for Alvarez to come in close. Paul leaned in to listen.

“Alright, so the Alderei claim that we have decoupled ourselves from our original timeline, and that headache incident was the moment that occurred. They claim that based on the date of the cipher, *which they had to decrypt to even read*, that we have re-emerged into real space thirty two hundred years in our collective past.” Henry began, drawing Alvarez in and speaking quietly.

“You have got to be kidding me.” Alvarez said, rubbing the bridge of his nose with his eyes squinched.

“No bullshit, or at least that’s what the Alderei are claiming.” Henry replied grimly. Alvarez shook his head slowly, looking miserable.

“No, I believe you, I am referring to something else. Unfortunately their story fits a rather disturbing discovery we made while you were gone.  We just didn't have the context until now to properly interpret it. Here, look at this.” Alvarez brought up a series of images on the main screen in front of them. 

First of Jupiter and Ganymede, then of the moon and Earth orbit, all of which were suspiciously dark and empty of important features.

“The shipyards… where is Ganymede, Liberty station? Even looking at two year old light they would still be there, at least Ganymede station should be visible, anyway. Construction at Liberty station had already begun, as well...” Paul said.

“Precisely what we've been scratching our heads about in the CIC while you were away. We first noticed the distinct lack of lights on Earth's night side, and afterward checked the shipyards. It sounds like you've given us our answer. They aren’t there because they *haven’t been built yet*.” Alvarez said in dawning horror.

“Then the Alderei told us the truth about the timelines.... We know they struggled to decrypt the cipher as it was more advanced than their current systems, so we can safety assume the date they gave us is most likely accurate.” Victor said, shaking his head.

“Meaning we are trapped in the GODDAMN BRONZE AGE!?” Lucas yelled, gaining the immediate ire of everyone in the command huddle.

“We're trapped in the bronze age?” “How is that possible?” “Oh god we're never getting home!” “You owe me fifty bucks, pay up.” “Hail Mary, full of grace…”

“Remove him. Lucas, keep your goddamn cool in the future or you will be permanently removed from command circles. Outbursts like that are panic spreaders, you should know better than that.” Henry said in a tone of pure ice.

Lucas froze, wide eyed, before Lance began to haul him away to the beginnings of an argument. Henry turned to the rest of the crew.

“It appears there was an oversight in the planning of this mission. Doctor Rousseau did not fully understand the implications of the technology he was working with; thus, it appears that we managed to detach ourselves from our home timeline during the mass migraine as we passed the Heliopause.""

Victor stepped in after that in the quiet that followed.

""We somehow have re-entered real space at the beginning of our own distinct human timeline, shortly before the onset of the Bronze age collapse, rather than returning to our spot in it where we belong. If I had to guess, that would have been when the last of the Giants were killed off and we gained our freedom from them. It would line up with the Greek dark age and certain other anomalies around that time...” 

Henry raised his hand to quell the murmurs.

“The Alderei claim we have two options ahead of us, we can leave and retry entering real space to see if we can eventually make it back close enough to our timeline to be happy, or we can stay and help them with their war for now while they research a way to control our re-entry point in space time through technology. If that second route succeeds, we can therefore gain the ability to go home any time and on our own terms. If we stay, the research could take anywhere from a few months to a few years, but it would grant us the working ability to freely travel both space and time and control our exit point, effectively turning the Indomitable Will into a time machine. This is also a promise being made by the most advanced race in the galaxy, who also happen to be at war with the giants like we are, so they are motivated to support us.”

“Permission to speak freely, Captain?” One of the faceless bridge crew asked.

Paul would have to get around to learning their names eventually. *Eh.*

“Granted, Thomas.” Henry said.

*Of course, HE knows their names.* Paul rolled his eyes.

“We fight with them for a few years against the giants while galactic super scientists try and upgrade our ship into a time machine? Or we roll the dice and hope we wind up with a better offer than that? Captain, how can we believe this insanity?!”

Henry must have pushed the collection of pictures to every terminal because even the background whispers died in that moment.

***…learn from him…use him… push them to accept the deal... this is the best you will get... do what you must to get to the surface... together we will command armies… we will scour our enemies from our new world… together we shall rule... None will stand in our way...***

Paul smirked; the devious little bastard did have good things to say here and there.

“As you can all see, no Ganymede station, no Luna. From here we should see the superstructure of Liberty Station going up in the L1 Lagrange point. Look at that last picture. Night side Europe without a single city light. We most definitely are not in our home timeline. I had originally thought this was a psyop when they first told us, but much of this discovery came as a real time surprise to them in ways that would be near impossible to fake. Now with our own scopes we come back to see proof. I see no alternative but to accept the fact that we are trapped in the past. We have to at least learn more about and explore this alliance idea. I have the ability as Captain to force this to happen, to give the order. Before I do so, I want to speak with you as an integral part of our officer corps. So let’s talk this out, make sure we are coming together with the best combined thinking to influence me to make the right final decision.”

“Hear, hear! For the Captain!” “I say we stay and fight!” “Better to stay with a promised ally than take our chances again!” “This is *not* our war!” ""Who cares, its been forced upon us! We don't have a choice!"" ""There is *always* a choice.""

“Okay, I hear a lot of support for staying to fight. There is more to this story. I both agree this is and *is not our fight*, the Alderei say that Earth in this timeline is populated by a human hybrid species called the Adamu. They are right now being ruled by the giants and are being kept in the bronze age to be exploited for labor, to extract raw materials, and to control their development. If we take their offer to stay and fight, it will be to liberate an alternate timeline version of our own people. Even if we never get that time machine technology to return home, this war will have meaning for us as we will be able to liberate our ancestors and steer the course of human history without making the same mistakes. Most of all, we will have a viable home here *if we are willing to fight for it.* Does anyone have a good case as to why we should abandon this timeline and try again with a new re-entry?”

“When you put it like that…” “What does HighComm have to say?” “Why get rid of a good hand for an unknown hand?” “We should stay out of this.”

Henry listened to the chatter going around intently. Paul scrutinized him and everyone, though it was clear the crew largely supported staying. Henry clearly had control from the start and had his mind made up, but the crew seemed to love the idea of influencing him, anyway.

“It sounds like the crew has spoken, then. On such a momentous decision to see a cross section of the crew so united helps me tremendously. We will partner with the Alderei, liberate the Adamu, and this system will serve as our hidden colony. When and if we gain the ability to return to our home timeline, it will be with an armada at our back, ready to turn the tide!”

*Whoa, where did that ambition come from? The crew is going nuts over it though.*

 *I****t will be difficult… to sway influence… from that one’s grasp… far better to cultivate your own harvest… to reap when the time is ripe...***

*Couldn’t agree with you more, creepy.*

“Thank you, all of you, for continuing to stick with us throughout everything. Right now, you all have privileged information, information that could start a panic. Do not spread it around. I will make the announcement to the rest of the crew, but first I need to bring the section chiefs and the officer corps into this. Alvarez, assemble our leadership team on the parade deck right away.”

“Consider it done.” He said as he walked off, already tapping at his datapad.

“Paul, I need you to watch the CIC for any suspicious movements from our friends over there while I'm giving this speech. We will be vulnerable until local command and control can be restored when the meeting is over. Keep the peace for me, please.” Henry said, earnestly.

Paul nodded and gripped the rail, looking at the foreboding triangular formation of alien ships on the zoomed in view.

“I will keep things quiet for you, don’t worry. Keep them together, Henry. Consult with them, but remember *you're in charge*. The final decision rests with *you and you alone*. You walk a dangerous tightrope. We cannot afford to stoke new fires of discontent.” Paul cautioned.

“I know, damn it all... I’ll be mindful, thank you.” Henry said before he turned to look away into empty space for a long moment.

“I just got a text from Alvarez, looks like he’s setting things up to be ready for me to speak in about fifteen. Just enough time to run over to C.L.A.P.P.E.R control to grab Chantal and Ariana, good.” Henry said, already turning to leave.

“Captain, can I come with you?” Jenkins asked, following behind. Henry just grunted and patted his shoulder before they left for the quick lift together.

 

# SHORTLY THEREAFTER…

***DATE: APRIL 19******^(TH)******, 7 A.U. (AFTER UNIFICATION)***  
***LOCATION: SOL SYSTEM, ABOARD UTRN INDOMITABLE WILL***

**CAPTAIN HENRY O’TOOLE**

Henry slowly paced in front of the crowd, examining faces and allowing the uncomfortable, curious energy peak just a little longer. Finally, he stopped in the center, took a step back to better see everyone, and then stopped to breathe deeply.

“Greetings and thank you for dropping your important tasks to be here. I will make this brief. You have been gathered here because you represent the vast majority of high and mid-level links in the chain of command. We are about to make an announcement to the crew that will stress us all, and we will be leaning on you all to help keep the crew together.”

Henry motioned to Chantal who was playing techie for him. She winked at him and then switched the screens on the wall behind Henry to show the pictures of the empty inner solar system and of the pitch black nighttime shot of Europe.

“Some of you may have seen these pictures while I was aboard the alien vessel beginning first contact negotiations. Some of you likely helped clamp down on the spread of rumors. If so, thank you. Unfortunately, these pictures are quite real and they stand as proof of a shocking claim made by the aliens. The truth is, there was a major unforeseen problem with the inversion drive. When we passed the heliopause, we detached ourselves from our connection to our native timeline. When we re-emerged into real space, it was into a different part of the timeline than we left. The decoupling event was the cause of that mass migraine we all experienced. The reason it seems like there is no Ganymede or Liberty station, or the whole of Europe seems to be bereft of cities with electric lights is proof positive that we’re in the wrong part of the timeline.”

Henry held up his hands to calm the crowd, which took him an uncomfortably long time to accomplish.

“That is the bad news. The good news is that we can classify second contact as a success. The race we have met is called the Alderei, and they have been at war with the giants for millennia now. We have begun early talks to cooperate, and they have pledged their support in helping us get back to our own timeline in time. They are advanced and prosperous, but they did not explore the inversion drive technology, so they do not have an immediate fix for us. However, they have pledged to begin research using their vast resources and superior scientific knowledge and technology, but that will take time to bear fruit, even for them. In the meantime, they have made an intriguing offer.”

Curiosity seemed to hold his audience silent as he gathered his thoughts for the next phase.

“According to the Alderei, we have emerged into an alternate universe timeline where Earth has been conquered by the giants early in our history, and humans are a vassal species. We have been given the offer of their support in liberating this timeline’s Earth from the grip of the giants while the Alderei research a way to select what part of what timeline we re-emerge into with our inversion drive. That would effectively turn the Indomitable Will into a time machine, one where we can selectively graft ourselves into any point of any timeline. Right now, the system reinserts us randomly, and likely creates a new alternate timeline every time it gets used. Even in the best case scenario, we will likely never be able to have an effect on our original home timeline again. The best we can realistically hope for is to return to create an alternate universe version of our home timeline where we return with an armada from our secret extra-dimensional base while our original continues without us. We can either take them up on this offer or roll the dice again and see what alternate universe we arrive in next time. This one at least has some potential allies willing to help us. The next time we may emerge into a hostile situation where they shoot first and ask questions later.”

Already murmurs were spreading through the crowd, *he was losing them.*

“Ultimately, the decision is mine as to what we do, though this decision is far to important to be made without hearing multiple opinions. I am strongly leaning towards liberating this young Earth and making this our secret colony so that we still accomplish our original goal, while standing to gain tremendously should we succeed. I want to hear dissenting opinions first, whomever has a burning thought, you have my permission to speak freely.”

That seemed to instantly change the energy in the room. Most of the nervous chatter had died, it seemed that most of them agreed. Several people seemed to be alight with manic energy, Henry selected the closest with a nod.

“Captain, how do we know we can trust their word, sir?”

“We don’t, I originally thought it was a psyop when they told us, but these are our own pictures with our own equipment which doesn’t lie. So far, everything else we have seen and heard from them appears to be truthful as well. Furthermore, we share a common enemy and they have treaties that clearly separate them from the Giants on ideological grounds. We don’t have all of the same values, but we share enough key values that we can coexist well, or so it seems. We don’t know if we can trust them yet, but the small details are painting a picture that says maybe we can. Time will tell, and we should maintain cautious boundaries, and demand protection, as well as firmly delineated agreements. Next!”

Henry pointed to a woman near the back who'd had her hand raised from the beginning.

“Oh, you actually picked me? Right! Thank you, sir! What guarantees are we being given that this technology they promise will ever exist? Will we be able to exit from this conflict at will? Do we keep our autonomy with this deal? I think we should make sure we are not signing up to be *their* new vassal species.""

""Thank you, Susan, those are all great concerns that I will bring up with them. We need to formalize our own strategic autonomy within this relationship and we will need to enshrine the right to end this partnership if we so choose.”

“Get it in writing, Captain!” “What happens again if we just leave and keep going?” “Fuck them, we can’t trust a goddamn xeno! They’re going to make us their cannon fodder!” “We can’t trust them.” “We don’t owe them anything!” “No human blood for xeno wars!”

“Enough! One at a time! I can hear all of you, and I am hearing a certain amount of speceism out there. Let’s address that. The main ideological divide in the galaxy appears to be over rights to free garden worlds as well as the treatment of intelligent life already developing on occupied worlds. The Alderei believe in non-interference, and galactic uplift treaties only ban the teaching of advanced technology to young races. Because of this, the giants enslave young races, guiding their development by keeping them in the bronze age so as to abide by the treaty through suppressing technological uplift. Earth and her humans are trapped as a client race right now and the Alderei cannot dislodge them due to galactic law. We have no such restrictions, and the odds are good that we can succeed, as this system is cut off from the possibility of reinforcements. This is their problem, yes, but in many ways this is also our battle, as the presence of anatomical humans down there makes this a uniquely human problem. There are as many ideological divides in the thoughts of alien minds as there are amongst humans. We by our own nature are no better or worse than they, so only our thoughts, actions and attitudes can truly separate us. Take care to elevate yourself above that which you hate, for the words of a hypocrite have no weight. Next! One at a time, this time, please!”

“Sir, do we know what year in history we are supposed to be in?”

“Good question Madison. No, we have not positively identified what year we are in, or even how close or recognizable this parallel universe we have been grafted into even will be. We might find a lot of similarity to the archaeological and mythological record, or everything might be different. We are going to request briefing packets on the situation on the ground as part of the second level first contact briefings we have planned with the Alderei tomorrow. Next!”

“Sir, I don’t think we should do this because it will restrict our freedom and put our people at risk for what, ultimately, is not *our* war.”

“Thank you Jackson, let’s address that. Our other option is to roll the dice and re enter the system again and again and again until the randomization gives us a better outcome than we have now. The outcome we have now is pretty damn optimal compared to how things could have been, as this time the Alderei chose to talk rather than shoot. We can address issues of freedom and autonomy through the negotiations process. There is a third option, even if its odds of success are minuscule.  Supposedly, we can hire what they call a true prophet who can help isolate and guide us to re-emerge in the proper spot on the right timeline. However, if we want to get access to Earth we need to work with the Alderei as they will not grant access to the planet lightly, so it is a plan C at best. Are there any more of you with objections or feedback?”

The room remained silent. Henry knew what he had to do.

“If there are no other objections, we will be drafting a treaty with the Alderei and we will move to liberate Novo Earth with the intent to make this our secret colony. If we ever gain the ability to choose our re-entry point with the Inversion drive we can return in force to support the larger war within our home timeline or an alternate version of it. Until that day, we need to get used to the idea that this timeline is our new home. I will make the announcement to the crew and will visit each section of the ship in turn to answer questions and calm concerns. Until then, please do not spread this information around until after I make the broader announcement. Thank you for your input, I know I can count on you to help keep things calm. You are dismissed and may return to your stations.”

Henry turned and left. Chantal caught up with him and gave his back a scratch, concern written across her face.

“You did good back there, they seemed to be pretty calm about taking in the news, all things considered” She said.

“Maybe its just the shock of the announcement, but they took it better than I feared they might. At least it seems my decision haven't made me any new enemies.""

""Yeah, but honey, you can’t put what happened before on your shoulders like that. You didn’t do this to them, they know that. If anyone has a target on their back its Dr. Rousseau. Even then, I didn’t catch this issue when I reviewed his work. A case could be made that I am partly to blame here, too.”

“Yeah, but this kinda stuff isn’t your area of expertise anyway babe, he's the one that should have foreseen this.  Nobody is going to blame you, at least not openly, *I won't allow it*.” Henry replied.

“All of our testing was in system, and it conformed to models, so it seemed natural to move to manned testing and implementation in a longer inter-system trip. Nothing in the models suggested that such a thing as decoupling from our timeline was even possible. Everyone wanted this to work so badly, it makes sense how this could have been overlooked... not that the oversight is excusable. I’m still worried that people are going to come after me when this gets out. I’ve already been enough of a target because of our skin contrast with random comments and dirty looks. That kinda stuff I am used to, but If people start to get the idea that I could have seen this coming, or I could have somehow prevented this…” Chantal shuddered.

“Don’t worry, I’ll keep you safe. Plus, Ariana will be assigned to be your bodyguard. You are far too precious to this mission, to me, to ever let you get hurt like that.” Henry replied cupping her hands in his and then hugging her close afterwards.

A familiar form seemed to emerge from the shadows behind them.

“I'm sorry about the delay, I stayed behind to watch the crowd disperse and to listen in on any conversations. I think the few detractors that we have left seem to at least understand your reasoning, even if they are unhappy over the outcome. We should be in the clear amongst our leadership. I am concerned about what happens when everyone in the broader crew knows.”

“There you are! Thanks for the report. What happens next is we trust our leaders to repeat back these talking points to their own people and to maintain order and good discipline. That should buy enough time for me to visit the section chiefs in person and put the worst remaining fears of our people to bed. Now, I have to write up a short speech for when I make the announcement. This time I spoke off the cuff, primarily so I could gather feedback. I won't have that luxury on the mass announcement later.”

“You'll do fine, sir. Even if there is some pockets of resistance and disbelief, we know how to handle it.” Ariana added in.

“Yes… Thank you. Exactly why I hedged my bets by prepping the leadership early. A mutiny can never be allowed to happen again. I'm going to rely on you and Paul to help make sure of it.” Henry said.

""Yes, sir."" Ariana replied. 

Henry stopped at the threshold to his quarters.

“I have a speech to write, I just wanted to make sure you were there to hear the update. Did you want to head up to C.L.A.P.P.E.R control to keep an eye on things, or did you want to stay here with me?” Henry asked Chantal.

“Henry, right now I'm just happy you made it out of there safe, so I’m gonna soak up as much time with you as I can. It was horrible waiting for you like that. Time just dragged on and there was no word from you at all, then people started sending those pictures around... Things almost got bad in there for a bit. You really should have checked in a lot sooner than you did!” Chantal shot Henry a glare.

“You’re right, I should have, but I also don't think you understand how dangerous those negotiations got in the middle there. Listen, I'll fill you in, just... not out here.” Henry said before he waved them into his room.

Chantal grit her teeth and followed him into the room with Ariana behind her. As soon as the door shut, Chantal's self control failed as the dam burst.

“How can you possibly be so calm about dropping a bomb like that!?!  Are you trying to make me a nervous wreck when you go back!?"" She yelled and slammed her fists against his chest before she collapsed into his shoulder. 

""It's going to be alright. I handled it, and things turned out well in the end."" He wrapped her in a tight hug until her breathing returned to a more normal pace.  

""I'm sorry... I just... Look, I knew what you told the crew had to be the sugar coated version, but I need you to tell me the truth. What *really* happened in there?” Chantal asked as she sat down on the corner of the bed next to Henry’s workstation.

“They flexed how advanced they were, they verbally fenced with me masterfully, they were eminently rational which made them easy to work with in some ways, though it was clear they still had a wholly alien worldview. In some ways it will be easy to get along with them, but in others it will be a major culture shock. They've created some kind of distributed consciousness called Consensus that functions as their form of government. Once we proved our story was true, they passed a handful of resolutions right in front of us in a manner of moments. Honestly, it's one hell of a system they have.” Henry said.

“They have a gestalt consciousness for a government!? That's incredible!” Chantal asked in giddy excitement.  

""Hold up, just a moment ago, you said they were dangerous. Now you're making them sound almost friendly."" Ariana pitched in with her arms folded.

“I didn't say *they* were dangerous, just that the negotiations themselves almost took a dangerous turn. We were detained temporarily in the room while they threatened to try us for espionage because our story did not line up with their reality. It wasn't until they tested my DNA and cracked the encryption on the cipher that they were able to determine we were telling the truth. Their fleets at this time are guarding the borders of our and many other solar systems against incursions by another, larger, and much more hostile faction of Giants.”

“Holy shit, really?” Ariana said, “So, how did Preston handle it?”

“Stoic, like a champ. He may just become something someday.” Henry replied, proudly. “Once they cracked the cipher, they were able to date it to *thirty two hundred years* in the future, give or take, once they converted our calendars back and forth. That moment really helped cool things down.”

“I had no idea it got that bad… I had a bad feeling, and I usually never let those bother me for long. I thought it weird that I couldn’t shake it this time, and here you were in real danger... Anyway, what happened after that?” Chantal replied.

“They added us to their Registry of Sophonts as an independent polity so they could classify us separately from the Adamu of Aht'Lantis, which is what the Giants of this timeline have named the humans and the Earth. This way they can form separate treaties which allow us to evict the Giants and take on the Adamu as our own client race without breaking galactic law. That is, of course, only should we choose to do so.”

“So a lot of good in with the bad is what you're saying.” Ariana added.

“Yeah, we have to think of the Alderei as an inherently logical species focused on rule of law, unbound by anything resembling modern liberal human morality. It makes sense how they could justify remaining hidden and abducting humans in our time for study, as we would be just another primitive pre-spaceflight society within their greater borders.  I'm not altogether convinced that their approach is much better than the Giants creating genetic hybrid rulers to actively manage and slow the development of the various races within their own territory. It would seem the ban on uplifting young races is one of the few things the Alderei and the Giants can both agree on.” Henry replied.

“How horribly pragmatic.” Chantal said, sounding a bit disgusted.

“Sounds to me like we can only trust them as far as our mutual interests align.” Ariana said.

“Precisely my read. There’s another problem that came up... Or an opportunity, depending on how we look at it.” Henry said. 

""And that is?"" Chantal asked with arms folded.

“They have offered to both genetically and physically modify a dozen or so of our key personnel into super soldiers capable of fighting what they call the god-kings. They claim the procedures are safe and have been tested, but who knows. The really tricky one that I am going to have to be extra careful with is the offer of functional immortality. I don’t know the technical details about it or how exactly they have succeeded, but that one worried me deeply. They only have fifteen vials, and everyone will want one. Managing access to that is going to be a political nightmare if we aren't careful.""

“Shit, how are you going to decide who gets what?” Ariana asked, her eyes widening in alarm.

“I will need to get a full list of our best combat personnel and we will prioritize them first. That way we can have multiple active ground teams led by super-soldier champions capable of defeating these false gods. Christ, I can’t believe I'm saying all of this with a straight face. *Fucking ET tech....*” Henry said, slightly exasperated.

“What other upgrades did they offer?” Chantal asked.

“They talked about subdermal armor, enhanced muscles, nanomachine upgrades that let you hold your breath for an hour, neural supercomputers, stuff like that.” Henry said, trying to remember everything.

“They're just offering us all of this clearly expensive tech for free? I find that highly suspicious. There has to be strings attached.” Chantal said.

“I asked the same thing, and they made it pretty clear that we would only get the super soldier tech if we joined their cause and decided to liberate Earth. In that way, it's a pretty standard carrot on a stick for us to do their bidding.”

“Do you think they actually have this level of technology? For all we know, they could be injecting us with a placebo, or even some kind of nanotech mind control.” Chantal asked, her arms folded.

“I don't know, but they have some means of melting the walls and floor to create doorways and even furniture on demand. When I asked about how they did it, they said they have such an overabundance of energy that such phase transition of matter control is trivially easy to them.” Henry shrugged.

“Well, that one comment in conjunction with their shipboard warp drives does seem to imply they have the technological prowess to support this, at least. Doesn't mean we can trust them, though.” Chantal said cryptically.

“How do you mean?” Ariana challenged.

“We have a scale to judge the advancement level of hypothetical alien species called the Kardashev scale, by my estimation they would be a strong K2, *maybe* even approaching a K3.  For reference, the giants are estimated to be a weak K2, and humanity is trying to break through to even be a K1. Our current pace of building LFTR power plants back on Earth and our industrial and technical developments will probably make us K1 by around fifty AU.” Chantal readjusted her glasses.

""I see."" Ariana relented.

“The point is, I don’t think they are bluffing as much as I did before. The odds of them actually being able to find us a real technical solution to our problem just went up from plausible to possible in my estimation. Quite a bit has changed.” Chantal said with a smirk. “Just make sure you are extra careful in there; these are incredibly dangerous beings to have as either allies or enemies.”

“Thank you, I’ll be sure to stay on my toes. On another note, Ariana I need you to do something.” Henry said.

“What do you need?”

“I am going to make the announcement soon that we are stranded and that we will be cooperating with these friendly ET. Your first job remains to protect Chantal, for now until things calm down. What I need you to do after that is decide if you want to be included in the ground combat teams and if you want to be a candidate for ET mods. I am strongly debating reserving a dose of the functional immortality for me and another for Chantal, especially since her mind is irreplaceable in maintaining the C.L.A.P.P.E.R systems. If I stop aging and start healing rapidly, then it effectively ends the mutiny threat and I can ensure mankind’s first starship remains in safe hands. I cannot answer for you if you want to consider immortality or maybe other mods instead, I just ask that you think about it and have an answer ready.”

“Damn, heavy stuff. I will let you know; I think the call of adventure will be overwhelming for me, but I am not sure if I would take the immortality option. I've been through some real bullshit in my life, and I'm not sure I want to live forever trapped with these memories. There's something nice about knowing that someday it will all come to an end, whether I like it to or not.” Ariana replied, almost robotically while staring off into space..

“Dark, you know I am totally here for you if you ever want to unpack some of that, right, sweetie?” Chantal offered with total sincerity.

“I love you girl, but *bite me*. I've adapted to my trauma in an effort to make myself a more effective weapon, which is precisely what the mission needs right now... Only a fool pulls the pin from a grenade without planning for the aftermath.”

“Fine, fine. I’ll leave it alone. Just, you know I am here for you, if you ever need me. Which you don’t, I get it, but if you ever do…” Chantal said with a cute sideways smile on her face and her hands raised disarmingly.

Ariana rolled her eyes and shook her head.

Henry wisely kept his mouth shut, having long ago recognized that not every conversation demanded his commentary. The silence that followed helped Henry's mind turn to writing the first draft of his speech. 

“I’m gonna need some coffee…” Henry leaned back in his chair. *It was going to be a long day.*",1,1728878859.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

The problem is that I feel I still haven’t fully figured out how to manage it, especially because I do have a relationship with her, though it’s low contact. For example, now she writes to me and asks for us to meet, just the two of us. But that gives me terrible anxiety because the last thing I want is to be alone with her. So, I told her I was busy, and when we meet, I’m usually with my kids and husband.

A few days ago, she wrote to my husband and asked him to have coffee with her alone. That makes me very nervous because I feel like she’s trying to stir up drama. It reminds me of my childhood, and I get very tense. My husband said something to brush her off (he’s not confrontational and is more of the super polite type). Today, I invited my mom to lunch with her husband, my husband, and the kids to try to ease the tension I feel she’s creating around me. (As an anecdote, she came 30 minutes before the time I told her to come, which is funny to me because I feel it’s not unintentional, but more a way to push even the silly boundary of time.)

And again, at one point when she was alone with my husband, she mentioned that she wanted to have coffee with him. I feel it’s super disrespectful that she expects my husband not to tell me. Or maybe she expects him to tell me, hoping to provoke a reaction from me, because I’ve been trying to adopt the grey rock method. 


I’m writing here because I feel like what really bothers me is that every interaction with her takes up so much of my mental energy. I spend hours thinking about how I should respond, what not to say, etc. And I’m exhausted.

I know many people will say that the easiest thing is to cut off contact, but I feel like I don’t want to go through that for several reasons that would be hard and long to explain here.

The worst part is that the more I’ve tried to establish healthy distance, the more she seems to spiral out of control.

I told my husband that I was thinking of asking her at some point why she wants to meet with him, but he’s terrified of how she might react.

Alright, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how Java Burn works. Initially, I was skeptical because it all sounded too good to be true. But after trying it out and digging into the details, I realized there's more to this than just hype. Java Burn doesn't just randomly help you lose weight; it targets multiple aspects of your body's processes to make the whole weight loss journey smoother and more effective. Let's break it down into a few key areas: minimizing excess weight by lowering appetite and suppressing hunger, maximizing metabolism, and increasing the fat-burning ratio.

# Lowering Appetite and Suppressing Hunger

One of the first things I noticed with Java Burn was a change in my appetite. Normally, I have a pretty healthy appetite, and snacking between meals was a bit of a habit. But with Java Burn, I found myself feeling fuller for longer periods. It was like my cravings were dialed down a notch. So, how does this happen?

Java Burn works by interacting with the signals your body sends to your brain about hunger and satiety (that feeling of being full). Usually, when your stomach is empty, certain hormones trigger hunger signals, which is why you feel the need to eat. Java Burn seems to help regulate these signals so you don’t get those urgent hunger pangs as often. It’s a gentle reminder that you don’t need that mid-afternoon snack.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Now, this doesn’t mean you’ll never feel hungry. But the constant urge to eat or snack, especially on unhealthy foods, seems to lessen. It's almost like having a built-in control switch that helps you make better choices without feeling deprived. This aspect alone can make a huge difference in managing your calorie intake, which is a big part of the weight loss equation.

# Maximizing Metabolism

Let’s talk about metabolism for a second. We all know someone who seems to eat whatever they want and never gains a pound. Chances are, they have a naturally high metabolism. For the rest of us, boosting metabolism can be key to shedding extra pounds. Java Burn claims to kickstart your metabolism and keep it running high throughout the day.

When I started using Java Burn, I noticed that my energy levels stayed more consistent. Typically, I'd experience a slump in the afternoon, but with Java Burn, I felt more energized. It turns out this isn’t just the caffeine talking. Java Burn contains a mix of ingredients like green tea extract, chromium, and L-theanine—all known to support metabolism and energy levels. These ingredients work together to keep your body in a state where it's more efficient at burning calories, even when you're not working out.

Over time, this boost in metabolism can lead to a significant impact on weight loss. Your body starts to burn more calories, not just from your morning coffee but throughout the day. It’s like giving your metabolic engine a tune-up, making it run more efficiently, and helping you lose weight more effectively.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Increasing the Fat-Burning Ratio

Another intriguing aspect of Java Burn is its focus on fat burning. We all have a mix of fat and muscle in our bodies, and when we lose weight, we want to lose fat, not muscle. Java Burn is designed to help your body prioritize fat as its energy source, particularly the stubborn fat that tends to accumulate around the belly.

The science behind this involves boosting your body's thermogenesis—the process by which your body generates heat and burns calories. Ingredients like green coffee bean extract and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn are known to enhance thermogenesis. This means your body burns more calories from fat stores, rather than just using up the calories from the food you eat.

From my experience, this approach seems to work subtly over time. I didn’t notice an immediate drastic change, but after a few weeks of consistent use, I saw a difference in how my clothes fit and felt. It wasn’t a quick fix, but the gradual shift in how my body was utilizing fat for energy was noticeable.

# Why Java Burn Might Be the Game-Changer You’ve Been Waiting For

So, why consider Java Burn over the countless other weight loss products out there? For starters, its convenience is hard to beat. You don’t have to overhaul your lifestyle or stick to a strict diet. If you're already a coffee drinker, integrating Java Burn into your daily routine is seamless. Plus, there’s something comforting about not having to change everything at once—just a simple addition to your morning coffee that can set the tone for the rest of your day.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Moreover, Java Burn doesn’t rely solely on caffeine to deliver results. The blend of natural ingredients is crafted to work synergistically, enhancing the overall effect on weight loss without the jittery side effects that some supplements cause. It’s a balanced approach that focuses on sustainable weight loss by addressing appetite, metabolism, and fat burning all at once.

# Final Thoughts on Java Burn

After spending time with Java Burn, I've come to appreciate its subtle yet effective approach to weight loss. It’s not a magic pill, and it won’t replace healthy eating and exercise, but it can be a helpful tool in your weight loss arsenal. The biggest takeaway is that Java Burn offers a practical way to support your weight loss goals without drastic changes to your lifestyle. If you're looking for a supplement that fits into your daily routine and provides steady, long-term results, Java Burn might just be the game-changer you've been waiting for.

I recently came across Java Burn, a powdered weight loss supplement that is designed to be mixed into your morning coffee. As someone who has struggled with losing weight for years despite diet and exercise, I was intrigued but also skeptical. Could just adding something to my daily coffee really help me lose weight?

I decided there was only one way to find out — try it myself. In this detailed review, I’ll share my experience using Java Burn, including the pros, cons, ingredients, and most importantly — did it actually help me lose weight?

# What Exactly is Java Burn?

**Java Burn is a patent-pending weight loss supplement sold exclusively online through JavaBurn.com.** It comes in powdered packets that you simply mix into your morning coffee.

The powder contains a blend of plant-based ingredients like green tea extract, L-theanine, chromium, and chlorogenic acid. According to the creators, these compounds work synergistically to:

# Who Created Java Burn?

Java Burn was created by **John Barban**, a leading expert in weight loss, sports nutrition, and metabolism. I did some research on John, and he checks out. He has undergraduate and masters degrees in human biology and nutrition and years of experience formulating supplements.

John says he worked with his team of supplement formulators to create a flavorless coffee additive using ingredients backed by science to support metabolism and energy levels.

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

","# The Unexpected Perks of a Coffee-Infused Weight Loss Journey

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

You've probably heard about all kinds of weight loss supplements. Let me introduce you to something a bit different: Java Burn. The name sounds like something you'd order at a coffee shop, but this isn't your regular cup of coffee. I stumbled upon Java Burn while searching for a way to shed a few pounds without the usual fuss. What caught my attention was its promise of fast and unbelievable weight loss. I know that sounds like a big claim, and you're probably thinking, ""Yeah, right."" But bear with me; this one might surprise you.

What's cool about Java Burn is that it’s designed to be mixed with your morning coffee—yep, you heard that right—your everyday coffee. It's like turning your regular caffeine fix into a weight-loss powerhouse. And the best part? It's super easy to use—no fancy diets or complicated routines required. You pour a little sachet into your coffee, and you're good to go.

In this Java Burn review, I'll explain what makes Java Burn stand out, how it works, and why it might be the product you've been looking for. So grab your favorite mug, and let’s dive into this not-so-ordinary weight loss journey together!

# [FOR MORE INFORMATION>>>JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# How Java Burn Works: A Deep Dive into the Magic

Alright, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how Java Burn works. Initially, I was skeptical because it all sounded too good to be true. But after trying it out and digging into the details, I realized there's more to this than just hype. Java Burn doesn't just randomly help you lose weight; it targets multiple aspects of your body's processes to make the whole weight loss journey smoother and more effective. Let's break it down into a few key areas: minimizing excess weight by lowering appetite and suppressing hunger, maximizing metabolism, and increasing the fat-burning ratio.

# Lowering Appetite and Suppressing Hunger

One of the first things I noticed with Java Burn was a change in my appetite. Normally, I have a pretty healthy appetite, and snacking between meals was a bit of a habit. But with Java Burn, I found myself feeling fuller for longer periods. It was like my cravings were dialed down a notch. So, how does this happen?

Java Burn works by interacting with the signals your body sends to your brain about hunger and satiety (that feeling of being full). Usually, when your stomach is empty, certain hormones trigger hunger signals, which is why you feel the need to eat. Java Burn seems to help regulate these signals so you don’t get those urgent hunger pangs as often. It’s a gentle reminder that you don’t need that mid-afternoon snack.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Now, this doesn’t mean you’ll never feel hungry. But the constant urge to eat or snack, especially on unhealthy foods, seems to lessen. It's almost like having a built-in control switch that helps you make better choices without feeling deprived. This aspect alone can make a huge difference in managing your calorie intake, which is a big part of the weight loss equation.

# Maximizing Metabolism

Let’s talk about metabolism for a second. We all know someone who seems to eat whatever they want and never gains a pound. Chances are, they have a naturally high metabolism. For the rest of us, boosting metabolism can be key to shedding extra pounds. Java Burn claims to kickstart your metabolism and keep it running high throughout the day.

When I started using Java Burn, I noticed that my energy levels stayed more consistent. Typically, I'd experience a slump in the afternoon, but with Java Burn, I felt more energized. It turns out this isn’t just the caffeine talking. Java Burn contains a mix of ingredients like green tea extract, chromium, and L-theanine—all known to support metabolism and energy levels. These ingredients work together to keep your body in a state where it's more efficient at burning calories, even when you're not working out.

Over time, this boost in metabolism can lead to a significant impact on weight loss. Your body starts to burn more calories, not just from your morning coffee but throughout the day. It’s like giving your metabolic engine a tune-up, making it run more efficiently, and helping you lose weight more effectively.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Increasing the Fat-Burning Ratio

Another intriguing aspect of Java Burn is its focus on fat burning. We all have a mix of fat and muscle in our bodies, and when we lose weight, we want to lose fat, not muscle. Java Burn is designed to help your body prioritize fat as its energy source, particularly the stubborn fat that tends to accumulate around the belly.

The science behind this involves boosting your body's thermogenesis—the process by which your body generates heat and burns calories. Ingredients like green coffee bean extract and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn are known to enhance thermogenesis. This means your body burns more calories from fat stores, rather than just using up the calories from the food you eat.

From my experience, this approach seems to work subtly over time. I didn’t notice an immediate drastic change, but after a few weeks of consistent use, I saw a difference in how my clothes fit and felt. It wasn’t a quick fix, but the gradual shift in how my body was utilizing fat for energy was noticeable.

# Why Java Burn Might Be the Game-Changer You’ve Been Waiting For

So, why consider Java Burn over the countless other weight loss products out there? For starters, its convenience is hard to beat. You don’t have to overhaul your lifestyle or stick to a strict diet. If you're already a coffee drinker, integrating Java Burn into your daily routine is seamless. Plus, there’s something comforting about not having to change everything at once—just a simple addition to your morning coffee that can set the tone for the rest of your day.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Moreover, Java Burn doesn’t rely solely on caffeine to deliver results. The blend of natural ingredients is crafted to work synergistically, enhancing the overall effect on weight loss without the jittery side effects that some supplements cause. It’s a balanced approach that focuses on sustainable weight loss by addressing appetite, metabolism, and fat burning all at once.

# Final Thoughts on Java Burn

After spending time with Java Burn, I've come to appreciate its subtle yet effective approach to weight loss. It’s not a magic pill, and it won’t replace healthy eating and exercise, but it can be a helpful tool in your weight loss arsenal. The biggest takeaway is that Java Burn offers a practical way to support your weight loss goals without drastic changes to your lifestyle. If you're looking for a supplement that fits into your daily routine and provides steady, long-term results, Java Burn might just be the game-changer you've been waiting for.

# How much Java Burn should I order?

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

","# The Unexpected Perks of a Coffee-Infused Weight Loss Journey

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

You've probably heard about all kinds of weight loss supplements. Let me introduce you to something a bit different: Java Burn. The name sounds like something you'd order at a coffee shop, but this isn't your regular cup of coffee. I stumbled upon Java Burn while searching for a way to shed a few pounds without the usual fuss. What caught my attention was its promise of fast and unbelievable weight loss. I know that sounds like a big claim, and you're probably thinking, ""Yeah, right."" But bear with me; this one might surprise you.

What's cool about Java Burn is that it’s designed to be mixed with your morning coffee—yep, you heard that right—your everyday coffee. It's like turning your regular caffeine fix into a weight-loss powerhouse. And the best part? It's super easy to use—no fancy diets or complicated routines required. You pour a little sachet into your coffee, and you're good to go.

In this Java Burn review, I'll explain what makes Java Burn stand out, how it works, and why it might be the product you've been looking for. So grab your favorite mug, and let’s dive into this not-so-ordinary weight loss journey together!

# [FOR MORE INFORMATION>>>JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# How Java Burn Works: A Deep Dive into the Magic

Alright, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how Java Burn works. Initially, I was skeptical because it all sounded too good to be true. But after trying it out and digging into the details, I realized there's more to this than just hype. Java Burn doesn't just randomly help you lose weight; it targets multiple aspects of your body's processes to make the whole weight loss journey smoother and more effective. Let's break it down into a few key areas: minimizing excess weight by lowering appetite and suppressing hunger, maximizing metabolism, and increasing the fat-burning ratio.

# Lowering Appetite and Suppressing Hunger

One of the first things I noticed with Java Burn was a change in my appetite. Normally, I have a pretty healthy appetite, and snacking between meals was a bit of a habit. But with Java Burn, I found myself feeling fuller for longer periods. It was like my cravings were dialed down a notch. So, how does this happen?

Java Burn works by interacting with the signals your body sends to your brain about hunger and satiety (that feeling of being full). Usually, when your stomach is empty, certain hormones trigger hunger signals, which is why you feel the need to eat. Java Burn seems to help regulate these signals so you don’t get those urgent hunger pangs as often. It’s a gentle reminder that you don’t need that mid-afternoon snack.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Now, this doesn’t mean you’ll never feel hungry. But the constant urge to eat or snack, especially on unhealthy foods, seems to lessen. It's almost like having a built-in control switch that helps you make better choices without feeling deprived. This aspect alone can make a huge difference in managing your calorie intake, which is a big part of the weight loss equation.

# Maximizing Metabolism

Let’s talk about metabolism for a second. We all know someone who seems to eat whatever they want and never gains a pound. Chances are, they have a naturally high metabolism. For the rest of us, boosting metabolism can be key to shedding extra pounds. Java Burn claims to kickstart your metabolism and keep it running high throughout the day.

When I started using Java Burn, I noticed that my energy levels stayed more consistent. Typically, I'd experience a slump in the afternoon, but with Java Burn, I felt more energized. It turns out this isn’t just the caffeine talking. Java Burn contains a mix of ingredients like green tea extract, chromium, and L-theanine—all known to support metabolism and energy levels. These ingredients work together to keep your body in a state where it's more efficient at burning calories, even when you're not working out.

Over time, this boost in metabolism can lead to a significant impact on weight loss. Your body starts to burn more calories, not just from your morning coffee but throughout the day. It’s like giving your metabolic engine a tune-up, making it run more efficiently, and helping you lose weight more effectively.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Increasing the Fat-Burning Ratio

Another intriguing aspect of Java Burn is its focus on fat burning. We all have a mix of fat and muscle in our bodies, and when we lose weight, we want to lose fat, not muscle. Java Burn is designed to help your body prioritize fat as its energy source, particularly the stubborn fat that tends to accumulate around the belly.

The science behind this involves boosting your body's thermogenesis—the process by which your body generates heat and burns calories. Ingredients like green coffee bean extract and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn are known to enhance thermogenesis. This means your body burns more calories from fat stores, rather than just using up the calories from the food you eat.

From my experience, this approach seems to work subtly over time. I didn’t notice an immediate drastic change, but after a few weeks of consistent use, I saw a difference in how my clothes fit and felt. It wasn’t a quick fix, but the gradual shift in how my body was utilizing fat for energy was noticeable.

# Why Java Burn Might Be the Game-Changer You’ve Been Waiting For

So, why consider Java Burn over the countless other weight loss products out there? For starters, its convenience is hard to beat. You don’t have to overhaul your lifestyle or stick to a strict diet. If you're already a coffee drinker, integrating Java Burn into your daily routine is seamless. Plus, there’s something comforting about not having to change everything at once—just a simple addition to your morning coffee that can set the tone for the rest of your day.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Moreover, Java Burn doesn’t rely solely on caffeine to deliver results. The blend of natural ingredients is crafted to work synergistically, enhancing the overall effect on weight loss without the jittery side effects that some supplements cause. It’s a balanced approach that focuses on sustainable weight loss by addressing appetite, metabolism, and fat burning all at once.

# Final Thoughts on Java Burn

After spending time with Java Burn, I've come to appreciate its subtle yet effective approach to weight loss. It’s not a magic pill, and it won’t replace healthy eating and exercise, but it can be a helpful tool in your weight loss arsenal. The biggest takeaway is that Java Burn offers a practical way to support your weight loss goals without drastic changes to your lifestyle. If you're looking for a supplement that fits into your daily routine and provides steady, long-term results, Java Burn might just be the game-changer you've been waiting for.

# How much Java Burn should I order?

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

These ingredients work together to keep your body in a state where it's more efficient at burning calories, even when you're not working out.

Over time, this boost in metabolism can lead to a significant impact on weight loss. Your body starts to burn more calories, not just from your morning coffee but throughout the day. It’s like giving your metabolic engine a tune-up, making it run more efficiently, and helping you lose weight more effectively.

# Increasing the Fat-Burning Ratio

Another intriguing aspect of Java Burn is its focus on fat burning. We all have a mix of fat and muscle in our bodies, and when we lose weight, we want to lose fat, not muscle. Java Burn is designed to help your body prioritize fat as its energy source, particularly the stubborn fat that tends to accumulate around the belly.

The science behind this involves boosting your body's thermogenesis—the process by which your body generates heat and burns calories. Ingredients like green coffee bean extract and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn are known to enhance thermogenesis. This means your body burns more calories from fat stores, rather than just using up the calories from the food you eat.

From my experience, this approach seems to work subtly over time. I didn’t notice an immediate drastic change, but after a few weeks of consistent use, I saw a difference in how my clothes fit and felt. It wasn’t a quick fix, but the gradual shift in how my body was utilizing fat for energy was noticeable.

# Why Java Burn Might Be the Game-Changer You’ve Been Waiting For

So, why consider Java Burn over the countless other weight loss products out there? For starters, its convenience is hard to beat. You don’t have to overhaul your lifestyle or stick to a strict diet. If you're already a coffee drinker, integrating Java Burn into your daily routine is seamless. Plus, there’s something comforting about not having to change everything at once—just a simple addition to your morning coffee that can set the tone for the rest of your day.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Moreover, Java Burn doesn’t rely solely on caffeine to deliver results. The blend of natural ingredients is crafted to work synergistically, enhancing the overall effect on weight loss without the jittery side effects that some supplements cause. It’s a balanced approach that focuses on sustainable weight loss by addressing appetite, metabolism, and fat burning all at once.

# Final Thoughts on Java Burn

After spending time with Java Burn, I've come to appreciate its subtle yet effective approach to weight loss. It’s not a magic pill, and it won’t replace healthy eating and exercise, but it can be a helpful tool in your weight loss arsenal. The biggest takeaway is that Java Burn offers a practical way to support your weight loss goals without drastic changes to your lifestyle. If you're looking for a supplement that fits into your daily routine and provides steady, long-term results, Java Burn might just be the game-changer you've been waiting for.

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

","# The Unexpected Perks of a Coffee-Infused Weight Loss Journey

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

You've probably heard about all kinds of weight loss supplements. Let me introduce you to something a bit different: Java Burn. The name sounds like something you'd order at a coffee shop, but this isn't your regular cup of coffee. I stumbled upon Java Burn while searching for a way to shed a few pounds without the usual fuss. What caught my attention was its promise of fast and unbelievable weight loss. I know that sounds like a big claim, and you're probably thinking, ""Yeah, right."" But bear with me; this one might surprise you.

What's cool about Java Burn is that it’s designed to be mixed with your morning coffee—yep, you heard that right—your everyday coffee. It's like turning your regular caffeine fix into a weight-loss powerhouse. And the best part? It's super easy to use—no fancy diets or complicated routines required. You pour a little sachet into your coffee, and you're good to go.

In this Java Burn review, I'll explain what makes Java Burn stand out, how it works, and why it might be the product you've been looking for. So grab your favorite mug, and let’s dive into this not-so-ordinary weight loss journey together!

# [FOR MORE INFORMATION>>>JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# How Java Burn Works: A Deep Dive into the Magic

Alright, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how Java Burn works. Initially, I was skeptical because it all sounded too good to be true. But after trying it out and digging into the details, I realized there's more to this than just hype. Java Burn doesn't just randomly help you lose weight; it targets multiple aspects of your body's processes to make the whole weight loss journey smoother and more effective. Let's break it down into a few key areas: minimizing excess weight by lowering appetite and suppressing hunger, maximizing metabolism, and increasing the fat-burning ratio.

# Lowering Appetite and Suppressing Hunger

One of the first things I noticed with Java Burn was a change in my appetite. Normally, I have a pretty healthy appetite, and snacking between meals was a bit of a habit. But with Java Burn, I found myself feeling fuller for longer periods. It was like my cravings were dialed down a notch. So, how does this happen?

Java Burn works by interacting with the signals your body sends to your brain about hunger and satiety (that feeling of being full). Usually, when your stomach is empty, certain hormones trigger hunger signals, which is why you feel the need to eat. Java Burn seems to help regulate these signals so you don’t get those urgent hunger pangs as often. It’s a gentle reminder that you don’t need that mid-afternoon snack.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Now, this doesn’t mean you’ll never feel hungry. But the constant urge to eat or snack, especially on unhealthy foods, seems to lessen. It's almost like having a built-in control switch that helps you make better choices without feeling deprived. This aspect alone can make a huge difference in managing your calorie intake, which is a big part of the weight loss equation.

# Maximizing Metabolism

Let’s talk about metabolism for a second. We all know someone who seems to eat whatever they want and never gains a pound. Chances are, they have a naturally high metabolism. For the rest of us, boosting metabolism can be key to shedding extra pounds. Java Burn claims to kickstart your metabolism and keep it running high throughout the day.

When I started using Java Burn, I noticed that my energy levels stayed more consistent. Typically, I'd experience a slump in the afternoon, but with Java Burn, I felt more energized. It turns out this isn’t just the caffeine talking. Java Burn contains a mix of ingredients like green tea extract, chromium, and L-theanine—all known to support metabolism and energy levels. These ingredients work together to keep your body in a state where it's more efficient at burning calories, even when you're not working out.

Over time, this boost in metabolism can lead to a significant impact on weight loss. Your body starts to burn more calories, not just from your morning coffee but throughout the day. It’s like giving your metabolic engine a tune-up, making it run more efficiently, and helping you lose weight more effectively.

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

","# The Unexpected Perks of a Coffee-Infused Weight Loss Journey

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

You've probably heard about all kinds of weight loss supplements. Let me introduce you to something a bit different: Java Burn. The name sounds like something you'd order at a coffee shop, but this isn't your regular cup of coffee. I stumbled upon Java Burn while searching for a way to shed a few pounds without the usual fuss. What caught my attention was its promise of fast and unbelievable weight loss. I know that sounds like a big claim, and you're probably thinking, ""Yeah, right."" But bear with me; this one might surprise you.

What's cool about Java Burn is that it’s designed to be mixed with your morning coffee—yep, you heard that right—your everyday coffee. It's like turning your regular caffeine fix into a weight-loss powerhouse. And the best part? It's super easy to use—no fancy diets or complicated routines required. You pour a little sachet into your coffee, and you're good to go.

In this Java Burn review, I'll explain what makes Java Burn stand out, how it works, and why it might be the product you've been looking for. So grab your favorite mug, and let’s dive into this not-so-ordinary weight loss journey together!

# [FOR MORE INFORMATION>>>JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# How Java Burn Works: A Deep Dive into the Magic

Alright, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how Java Burn works. Initially, I was skeptical because it all sounded too good to be true. But after trying it out and digging into the details, I realized there's more to this than just hype. Java Burn doesn't just randomly help you lose weight; it targets multiple aspects of your body's processes to make the whole weight loss journey smoother and more effective. Let's break it down into a few key areas: minimizing excess weight by lowering appetite and suppressing hunger, maximizing metabolism, and increasing the fat-burning ratio.

# Lowering Appetite and Suppressing Hunger

One of the first things I noticed with Java Burn was a change in my appetite. Normally, I have a pretty healthy appetite, and snacking between meals was a bit of a habit. But with Java Burn, I found myself feeling fuller for longer periods. It was like my cravings were dialed down a notch. So, how does this happen?

Java Burn works by interacting with the signals your body sends to your brain about hunger and satiety (that feeling of being full). Usually, when your stomach is empty, certain hormones trigger hunger signals, which is why you feel the need to eat. Java Burn seems to help regulate these signals so you don’t get those urgent hunger pangs as often. It’s a gentle reminder that you don’t need that mid-afternoon snack.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Now, this doesn’t mean you’ll never feel hungry. But the constant urge to eat or snack, especially on unhealthy foods, seems to lessen. It's almost like having a built-in control switch that helps you make better choices without feeling deprived. This aspect alone can make a huge difference in managing your calorie intake, which is a big part of the weight loss equation.

# Maximizing Metabolism

Let’s talk about metabolism for a second. We all know someone who seems to eat whatever they want and never gains a pound. Chances are, they have a naturally high metabolism. For the rest of us, boosting metabolism can be key to shedding extra pounds. Java Burn claims to kickstart your metabolism and keep it running high throughout the day.

When I started using Java Burn, I noticed that my energy levels stayed more consistent. Typically, I'd experience a slump in the afternoon, but with Java Burn, I felt more energized. It turns out this isn’t just the caffeine talking. Java Burn contains a mix of ingredients like green tea extract, chromium, and L-theanine—all known to support metabolism and energy levels. These ingredients work together to keep your body in a state where it's more efficient at burning calories, even when you're not working out.

Over time, this boost in metabolism can lead to a significant impact on weight loss. Your body starts to burn more calories, not just from your morning coffee but throughout the day. It’s like giving your metabolic engine a tune-up, making it run more efficiently, and helping you lose weight more effectively.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Increasing the Fat-Burning Ratio

Another intriguing aspect of Java Burn is its focus on fat burning. We all have a mix of fat and muscle in our bodies, and when we lose weight, we want to lose fat, not muscle. Java Burn is designed to help your body prioritize fat as its energy source, particularly the stubborn fat that tends to accumulate around the belly.

The science behind this involves boosting your body's thermogenesis—the process by which your body generates heat and burns calories. Ingredients like green coffee bean extract and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn are known to enhance thermogenesis. This means your body burns more calories from fat stores, rather than just using up the calories from the food you eat.

From my experience, this approach seems to work subtly over time. I didn’t notice an immediate drastic change, but after a few weeks of consistent use, I saw a difference in how my clothes fit and felt. It wasn’t a quick fix, but the gradual shift in how my body was utilizing fat for energy was noticeable.

# Why Java Burn Might Be the Game-Changer You’ve Been Waiting For

So, why consider Java Burn over the countless other weight loss products out there? For starters, its convenience is hard to beat. You don’t have to overhaul your lifestyle or stick to a strict diet. If you're already a coffee drinker, integrating Java Burn into your daily routine is seamless. Plus, there’s something comforting about not having to change everything at once—just a simple addition to your morning coffee that can set the tone for the rest of your day.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Moreover, Java Burn doesn’t rely solely on caffeine to deliver results. The blend of natural ingredients is crafted to work synergistically, enhancing the overall effect on weight loss without the jittery side effects that some supplements cause. It’s a balanced approach that focuses on sustainable weight loss by addressing appetite, metabolism, and fat burning all at once.

# Final Thoughts on Java Burn

After spending time with Java Burn, I've come to appreciate its subtle yet effective approach to weight loss. It’s not a magic pill, and it won’t replace healthy eating and exercise, but it can be a helpful tool in your weight loss arsenal. The biggest takeaway is that Java Burn offers a practical way to support your weight loss goals without drastic changes to your lifestyle. If you're looking for a supplement that fits into your daily routine and provides steady, long-term results, Java Burn might just be the game-changer you've been waiting for.

# How much Java Burn should I order?

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

You've probably heard about all kinds of weight loss supplements. Let me introduce you to something a bit different: Java Burn. The name sounds like something you'd order at a coffee shop, but this isn't your regular cup of coffee. I stumbled upon Java Burn while searching for a way to shed a few pounds without the usual fuss. What caught my attention was its promise of fast and unbelievable weight loss. I know that sounds like a big claim, and you're probably thinking, ""Yeah, right."" But bear with me; this one might surprise you.

What's cool about Java Burn is that it’s designed to be mixed with your morning coffee—yep, you heard that right—your everyday coffee. It's like turning your regular caffeine fix into a weight-loss powerhouse. And the best part? It's super easy to use—no fancy diets or complicated routines required. You pour a little sachet into your coffee, and you're good to go.

In this Java Burn review, I'll explain what makes Java Burn stand out, how it works, and why it might be the product you've been looking for. So grab your favorite mug, and let’s dive into this not-so-ordinary weight loss journey together!

# [FOR MORE INFORMATION>>>JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# How Java Burn Works: A Deep Dive into the Magic

Alright, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how Java Burn works. Initially, I was skeptical because it all sounded too good to be true. But after trying it out and digging into the details, I realized there's more to this than just hype. Java Burn doesn't just randomly help you lose weight; it targets multiple aspects of your body's processes to make the whole weight loss journey smoother and more effective. Let's break it down into a few key areas: minimizing excess weight by lowering appetite and suppressing hunger, maximizing metabolism, and increasing the fat-burning ratio.

# Lowering Appetite and Suppressing Hunger

One of the first things I noticed with Java Burn was a change in my appetite. Normally, I have a pretty healthy appetite, and snacking between meals was a bit of a habit. But with Java Burn, I found myself feeling fuller for longer periods. It was like my cravings were dialed down a notch. So, how does this happen?

Java Burn works by interacting with the signals your body sends to your brain about hunger and satiety (that feeling of being full). Usually, when your stomach is empty, certain hormones trigger hunger signals, which is why you feel the need to eat. Java Burn seems to help regulate these signals so you don’t get those urgent hunger pangs as often. It’s a gentle reminder that you don’t need that mid-afternoon snack.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Now, this doesn’t mean you’ll never feel hungry. But the constant urge to eat or snack, especially on unhealthy foods, seems to lessen. It's almost like having a built-in control switch that helps you make better choices without feeling deprived. This aspect alone can make a huge difference in managing your calorie intake, which is a big part of the weight loss equation.

# Maximizing Metabolism

Let’s talk about metabolism for a second. We all know someone who seems to eat whatever they want and never gains a pound. Chances are, they have a naturally high metabolism. For the rest of us, boosting metabolism can be key to shedding extra pounds. Java Burn claims to kickstart your metabolism and keep it running high throughout the day.

When I started using Java Burn, I noticed that my energy levels stayed more consistent. Typically, I'd experience a slump in the afternoon, but with Java Burn, I felt more energized. It turns out this isn’t just the caffeine talking. Java Burn contains a mix of ingredients like green tea extract, chromium, and L-theanine—all known to support metabolism and energy levels. These ingredients work together to keep your body in a state where it's more efficient at burning calories, even when you're not working out.

Over time, this boost in metabolism can lead to a significant impact on weight loss. Your body starts to burn more calories, not just from your morning coffee but throughout the day. It’s like giving your metabolic engine a tune-up, making it run more efficiently, and helping you lose weight more effectively.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Increasing the Fat-Burning Ratio

Another intriguing aspect of Java Burn is its focus on fat burning. We all have a mix of fat and muscle in our bodies, and when we lose weight, we want to lose fat, not muscle. Java Burn is designed to help your body prioritize fat as its energy source, particularly the stubborn fat that tends to accumulate around the belly.

The science behind this involves boosting your body's thermogenesis—the process by which your body generates heat and burns calories. Ingredients like green coffee bean extract and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn are known to enhance thermogenesis. This means your body burns more calories from fat stores, rather than just using up the calories from the food you eat.

From my experience, this approach seems to work subtly over time. I didn’t notice an immediate drastic change, but after a few weeks of consistent use, I saw a difference in how my clothes fit and felt. It wasn’t a quick fix, but the gradual shift in how my body was utilizing fat for energy was noticeable.

# Why Java Burn Might Be the Game-Changer You’ve Been Waiting For

So, why consider Java Burn over the countless other weight loss products out there? For starters, its convenience is hard to beat. You don’t have to overhaul your lifestyle or stick to a strict diet. If you're already a coffee drinker, integrating Java Burn into your daily routine is seamless. Plus, there’s something comforting about not having to change everything at once—just a simple addition to your morning coffee that can set the tone for the rest of your day.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Moreover, Java Burn doesn’t rely solely on caffeine to deliver results. The blend of natural ingredients is crafted to work synergistically, enhancing the overall effect on weight loss without the jittery side effects that some supplements cause. It’s a balanced approach that focuses on sustainable weight loss by addressing appetite, metabolism, and fat burning all at once.

# Final Thoughts on Java Burn

After spending time with Java Burn, I've come to appreciate its subtle yet effective approach to weight loss. It’s not a magic pill, and it won’t replace healthy eating and exercise, but it can be a helpful tool in your weight loss arsenal. The biggest takeaway is that Java Burn offers a practical way to support your weight loss goals without drastic changes to your lifestyle. If you're looking for a supplement that fits into your daily routine and provides steady, long-term results, Java Burn might just be the game-changer you've been waiting for.

# How much Java Burn should I order?

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

You've probably heard about all kinds of weight loss supplements. Let me introduce you to something a bit different: Java Burn. The name sounds like something you'd order at a coffee shop, but this isn't your regular cup of coffee. I stumbled upon Java Burn while searching for a way to shed a few pounds without the usual fuss. What caught my attention was its promise of fast and unbelievable weight loss. I know that sounds like a big claim, and you're probably thinking, ""Yeah, right."" But bear with me; this one might surprise you.

What's cool about Java Burn is that it’s designed to be mixed with your morning coffee—yep, you heard that right—your everyday coffee. It's like turning your regular caffeine fix into a weight-loss powerhouse. And the best part? It's super easy to use—no fancy diets or complicated routines required. You pour a little sachet into your coffee, and you're good to go.

In this Java Burn review, I'll explain what makes Java Burn stand out, how it works, and why it might be the product you've been looking for. So grab your favorite mug, and let’s dive into this not-so-ordinary weight loss journey together!

# [FOR MORE INFORMATION>>>JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# How Java Burn Works: A Deep Dive into the Magic

Alright, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how Java Burn works. Initially, I was skeptical because it all sounded too good to be true. But after trying it out and digging into the details, I realized there's more to this than just hype. Java Burn doesn't just randomly help you lose weight; it targets multiple aspects of your body's processes to make the whole weight loss journey smoother and more effective. Let's break it down into a few key areas: minimizing excess weight by lowering appetite and suppressing hunger, maximizing metabolism, and increasing the fat-burning ratio.

# Lowering Appetite and Suppressing Hunger

One of the first things I noticed with Java Burn was a change in my appetite. Normally, I have a pretty healthy appetite, and snacking between meals was a bit of a habit. But with Java Burn, I found myself feeling fuller for longer periods. It was like my cravings were dialed down a notch. So, how does this happen?

Java Burn works by interacting with the signals your body sends to your brain about hunger and satiety (that feeling of being full). Usually, when your stomach is empty, certain hormones trigger hunger signals, which is why you feel the need to eat. Java Burn seems to help regulate these signals so you don’t get those urgent hunger pangs as often. It’s a gentle reminder that you don’t need that mid-afternoon snack.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Now, this doesn’t mean you’ll never feel hungry. But the constant urge to eat or snack, especially on unhealthy foods, seems to lessen. It's almost like having a built-in control switch that helps you make better choices without feeling deprived. This aspect alone can make a huge difference in managing your calorie intake, which is a big part of the weight loss equation.

# Maximizing Metabolism

Let’s talk about metabolism for a second. We all know someone who seems to eat whatever they want and never gains a pound. Chances are, they have a naturally high metabolism. For the rest of us, boosting metabolism can be key to shedding extra pounds. Java Burn claims to kickstart your metabolism and keep it running high throughout the day.

When I started using Java Burn, I noticed that my energy levels stayed more consistent. Typically, I'd experience a slump in the afternoon, but with Java Burn, I felt more energized. It turns out this isn’t just the caffeine talking. Java Burn contains a mix of ingredients like green tea extract, chromium, and L-theanine—all known to support metabolism and energy levels. These ingredients work together to keep your body in a state where it's more efficient at burning calories, even when you're not working out.

Over time, this boost in metabolism can lead to a significant impact on weight loss. Your body starts to burn more calories, not just from your morning coffee but throughout the day. It’s like giving your metabolic engine a tune-up, making it run more efficiently, and helping you lose weight more effectively.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Increasing the Fat-Burning Ratio

Another intriguing aspect of Java Burn is its focus on fat burning. We all have a mix of fat and muscle in our bodies, and when we lose weight, we want to lose fat, not muscle. Java Burn is designed to help your body prioritize fat as its energy source, particularly the stubborn fat that tends to accumulate around the belly.

The science behind this involves boosting your body's thermogenesis—the process by which your body generates heat and burns calories. Ingredients like green coffee bean extract and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn are known to enhance thermogenesis. This means your body burns more calories from fat stores, rather than just using up the calories from the food you eat.

From my experience, this approach seems to work subtly over time. I didn’t notice an immediate drastic change, but after a few weeks of consistent use, I saw a difference in how my clothes fit and felt. It wasn’t a quick fix, but the gradual shift in how my body was utilizing fat for energy was noticeable.

# Why Java Burn Might Be the Game-Changer You’ve Been Waiting For

So, why consider Java Burn over the countless other weight loss products out there? For starters, its convenience is hard to beat. You don’t have to overhaul your lifestyle or stick to a strict diet. If you're already a coffee drinker, integrating Java Burn into your daily routine is seamless. Plus, there’s something comforting about not having to change everything at once—just a simple addition to your morning coffee that can set the tone for the rest of your day.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Moreover, Java Burn doesn’t rely solely on caffeine to deliver results. The blend of natural ingredients is crafted to work synergistically, enhancing the overall effect on weight loss without the jittery side effects that some supplements cause. It’s a balanced approach that focuses on sustainable weight loss by addressing appetite, metabolism, and fat burning all at once.

# Final Thoughts on Java Burn

After spending time with Java Burn, I've come to appreciate its subtle yet effective approach to weight loss. It’s not a magic pill, and it won’t replace healthy eating and exercise, but it can be a helpful tool in your weight loss arsenal. The biggest takeaway is that Java Burn offers a practical way to support your weight loss goals without drastic changes to your lifestyle. If you're looking for a supplement that fits into your daily routine and provides steady, long-term results, Java Burn might just be the game-changer you've been waiting for.

As someone who has struggled with losing weight for years despite diet and exercise, I was intrigued but also skeptical. Could just adding something to my daily coffee really help me lose weight?

I decided there was only one way to find out — try it myself. In this detailed review, I’ll share my experience using Java Burn, including the pros, cons, ingredients, and most importantly — did it actually help me lose weight?

# What Exactly is Java Burn?

**Java Burn is a patent-pending weight loss supplement sold exclusively online through JavaBurn.com.** It comes in powdered packets that you simply mix into your morning coffee.

The powder contains a blend of plant-based ingredients like green tea extract, L-theanine, chromium, and chlorogenic acid. According to the creators, these compounds work synergistically to:

* Boost metabolism

The overall goal is to help users lose weight by enhancing their body’s natural metabolic function.

# Who Created Java Burn?

Java Burn was created by **John Barban**, a leading expert in weight loss, sports nutrition, and metabolism. I did some research on John, and he checks out. He has undergraduate and masters degrees in human biology and nutrition and years of experience formulating supplements.

John says he worked with his team of supplement formulators to create a flavorless coffee additive using ingredients backed by science to support metabolism and energy levels. The fact that the formula was developed by someone as credentialed as John gave me confidence that Java Burn wasn’t just some fad product.

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

I read somewhere in here a while back to share progress and I always meant to document my progress but i neglected to do so.  So I figured I would do a quick write up for you all.

2 years ago I found this reddit, restoration was something I always wanted to try, I had a friend who was openly focused on jelqing that is what sparked my curiosity. This reddit solidified the idea, and i ordered a stealth retainer. 

When I started I was a QI-1 i purchased a stealth retainer, using the string method to order the right size. I don't recall the exact reason but I began tugging, but i started using a 2 foot piece of parachute cord, tied from my retainer to my desk leg. I managed probably 7 hours a day that way, over the past 6 months I've stated tieing off on my coffee table in the evening bringing me to probably 9 hours a day during the week, and only 3 a day on weekends. 

Now I'm creeping into QI-4 territory. if i get sore I use some emu oil before bed which seems to coincide with my most dramatic progress.  Sensations during intercourse feels different and better, I feel like my stamina has improved some as well. 

I just want to say stay positive.

I don’t usually correct people because a) I’m not interested in inviting hostility by coming out to every other customer in a Southern Indiana small town and b) most of these people I rarely ever see and wouldn’t remember anyways. But I also get customers who gender me correctly or don’t seem to know how to gender me at all (my faves lol).

Side note—People are more likely to think I’m a dude if I haven’t spoken yet. I’ve been on T for a little less than three years, albeit inconsistently, but my voice is still pretty feminine. I never pass over the phone, for example. I probably need voice training but I haven’t committed to it yet. This makes me think people probably read me as pretty androgynous or maybe as a teenage boy until I open my mouth, lmao.

Anyways, I was at an event the other day and when I was waiting in line a guy gestured for me to come up and asked, “What do you want, sir?” It was pretty nice because I’d been on register and talking quite a bit, so most of my customers were ID’ing me as a woman all day.

Later on I mentioned this to a friend, a cis guy, and he told me that people who know anything about trans folks probably look at me and know I’m transgender and their first guess is that I’m probably a trans man, and that’s how I’m getting gendered correctly. I don’t think he meant it that way but it was pretty discouraging.

I don’t mind being openly trans because I talk about my feelings and experiences, but I don’t want it to be because I’m visually obviously trans and people are trying to be polite. I have a pretty big chest and binding and layering don’t really hide it well, so I’ve been telling myself top surgery is going to be a game changer. But now his comment has me kind of questioning if there’s something very clockable about my face. That really troubles me because there’s nothing a can do about it. I can’t even grow a beard. I have a mostly invisible T stache that I never shave because it makes me euphoric but I’m pretty sure most people don’t notice it. And that’s not even touching my hips. I have a really curvy body and it’s pretty obvious to people that I have wide hips even when I dress to minimize them.

I guess I’m mostly looking for an emotional pick me up here, but I also know there are other people in this group who probably are at the same weird middle point of transitioning and I’m hoping y’all might have some unusual tips or advice that help you pass a little, beyond the usual layering, etc. I know I’m not likely to fully pass any time soon or maybe ever but I’d like to improve my odds a little, purely on the physical level.

Okay so to start with I have a friend or I guess ex friend and we will call her Lena. We have been friends for 6 years and I introduced her to her now husband Jeff. I was a bridesmaid in her wedding. Honestly? I regret it now. This post deals with mental health pretty intensely as a heads up. All parties are safe now in this moment

Lena struggles with something called borderline personality disorder as well as histrionic personality disorder, PTSD and ADHD. She struggles with alcohol and smokes weed excessively to the point she will fall asleep at parties. 

A bit about me is I struggle with being a recoverying addict in sustained remission, have pretty severe PTSD from work, as well as bipolar disorder and happen to work in the mental health field. I've gotten treatment and it's my passion helping other people get through what they are going through but it does require a lot of energy to stay healthy so I can do that.

There are three big incidents I need to get off my chest as I'm feeling guilty and need to know if I screwed up 

1) Last year Lena and Jeff went on their first big vacation together. She got too drunk, ran away, called me saying she was going to go swim away into the ocean forever. I was in another country and she would not tell me where she was, confirm her safety or anything like that. I sent a screenshot of her location to Jeff who found her, thanked me and I thought that would be that. Nope. 

Jeff calls me back saying Lena is on the deck of their 5th floor place making threats to jump and that she was hurting him physically, screaming that he was assaulting her (he wasnt). They were on FaceTime and there whattered glass and blood was everywhere. She took a piece of said glass and tried to slit her throat while looking right into the camera. He proceeded to follow suit yelling ""this is what it feels like when you do that in front of me"".  It was chaos. I called their parents, their siblings anyone who knew where they were but nothing. I had to send paramedics by calling from another country after finding their location on Snapchat. Once they were home Jeff stayed with us and Lena stayed with her parents. Jeff has very little family support so we are like surrogates that way for him. I didnt speak to her for six months as I was pretty traumatized not going to lie. Jeff was more reactionary and it is not part of his usual response to anything EVER, so we worked it out. However there's been a pattern of Lena running away and trying to hurt herself as well as then laughing and borderline gloating about her behaviour. She has said it herself she does it sometimes just to get a reaction.

2) This past summer Jeff called me asking if I had heard from Lena and if I could please call her. We had patched things up a bit, though no where near as close as we used to be but I was always good at calming her down. I guess they had a fight and I talked her down, thought that was that. Jeff called me back asking where she was, if she still had the dog and asked if she had told me she was drunk. She refused to tell anyone her location, threatened her own livelihood and would not pull over or answer her phone. So I called the cops. She was found on my deck in my complex covered in mud, with her dog, drinks spilled all over, huge injury to her leg, screaming and banging on my door to let her in. Called back police, got no charges as I mentioned her BPD and got her husband to pick her up to bring her to hospital. She had also crashed her car to the point it was not drivable. I lost most of my respect for her in the moment.  What if her dog got hurt? What if an innocent were harmed? Her rationale was if everyone hated her she could kill herself and it wouldn't hurt anyone. 

She proceeded to cuss out her mother on Mother's day to the point another police file was opened and tried to jump out of her vehicle on the way to the psych ward.... a whole hullabaloo that I being the people pleaser I was with poor work/life balance and boundaries at the time. Dealt with from start to finish as I was worried sick and she proceeded to self injure and texted me saying it was my fault. She tried to take some pills, required sedation by the nurses after taking apart a pop can and using it to hurt herself. Just a nightmare. I again took some space for myself and really started to question the friendship. The trigger for this situation? Ironically Jeff spent the night before at my place on the futon, as he often does when he visits, as he didn't want to drive drunk.

So with that background in mind, here is where I might be the asshole

3) I threw her sister Megan, who is also a close friend of mine, a birthday party this year. Only 6 people total including us and our partners were there. Super low key just snacks, movies and a few games and chitchat. A killer homemade pinata. Please note, I also had a party for Lena's birthday and invited the people she wanted there with an equal amount of effort. Megan was still struggling with what happened during incident number 2 and we decided to not invite Lena this time around, with Megan intending to meet her 1 on 1. Lena hadn't been getting treatment consistently for her condition and could be rather volatile especially in group situations where the attention is focused not on her as harsh as that sounds. She had only just started to take steps to care for herself but it takes time to earn trust back.

 Party went off without a hitch, however as I kind of expected I recieved from Lena a text saying ""I can't believe you wouldn't invite me to my own sisters birthday Im hurt"". At first I tried to be validating and explain it was a small get together, that I had just followed the provided guest list I was given and that her sister was hoping to do something with her personally. That didn't go well. I proceeded to get messages saying that that was bullshit, that I was disrespectful to her and that I was rude. I told her just because she wasn't invited this time doesn't mean I dont want her at future events, just that things were being kept small this time.

At that point I asked her to call me so we could talk out, again validating she was upset but explaining the day was about Megan and what she wantedd, not her. She proceeded to say that I had deliberately excluded her and that I had hidden it from her purposefully, despite us having a conversation already about it which she stated to have not remembered. She stated she felt alone and like she doesn't matter or deserve anything in her life. I reminded her Megan was excited to see her still and that she had made plans already. I explained that Megan only wanted me and her other best friend Paul and partners that night for board games and such and that many people did not recieve an invite, this included two of her other best friends. She continued to tell me that I was spewing bullshit. I at this point tried to stop the conversation from progressing by asking if we could take a break and grab a coffee to talk in person later in the week and fully talk things through. 

She then started attacking me as a person telling me she always has to walk on eggshells around me as shes too much for me, that she has to hide her emotions as I can't handle them, that I'm manipulative for saying that my own feelings were being hurt with the way she was speaking to me. Specifically said ""If I voice my displeasure with you, you turn it around and make it my fault for expressing my feelings THIS IS MANIPULATIVE AND HURTS ME MORE THAN IT WILL EVER HURT YOU."" She said I don't appreciate all the things she does for me, sending me a picture of a sign she had make me for my bathroom that included a cocaine reference (recoverying addict I don't want to be triggered every time I take a bath but I guess the thought counts?) Either way I thanked her for her time and effort but again asked when we could talk in person or over the phone trying to call her, yet goes to voicemail.

 At this point Im starting to get pissed, my phone is blowing up for 3 days with text message after text message about how I'm never there, that it's like Im a different person since I went to treatment yadayada. I laid my boundaries out very clearly and said hey you need to understand that despite you struggling as well, supporting you through traumatic situations is hard on me and I can't be the type of support you expect of me anymore. I do this everyday for work. I can't do this in my off hours.

She said every time I try to help her by keeping her alive I just make it worse, that I'm a gossip as I called people to support her and look out for her, and that I think she's stupid and again started beating herself up saying she doesn't deserve life and so on. Stated I had given her trauma flashbacks and a panic attack by holding her responsible for her behaviours. She tends to do extremely negative self talk often where she will things like ""If I ended it you wouldn't even cry"" and things like that, generally to gauge a reaction and get her needs met, generally looking to be validated in that she is worthy of life. I don't get pulled into this behaviour as it's not healthy for anyone involved and the conversations go in circles.

So with that context, after attempting one last call again over 3 days of my phone blowing up with things that were really hurtful I sent the following. This is where I may be the asshole

""So I cant stop you from killing yourself and you're allowed to slit your throat in front of me on FaceTime? To show up at my home after driving drunk? To be blamed for you hurting yourself on multiple occasions without any thought of where I'm at? Im done and I'm not dealing with this anymore. I tell people because your life matters in an emergency. If I left it you'd lose it on me for me not caring, or be dead. I've tried to be civil but I just can't do this friendship anymore its not healthy. I won't be shit talking you or your life to our mutuals, but this I think is where our roads need to split.  If we run into eachother I'll keep it chill but this is not going to work out at this time.  Maybe with time and distance. But not now.""

She finally called me and I purposefully let it go to voicemail responding with ""What do you want? You couldn't bother to call me until now? Everyone has a breaking point"".

She is blocked.

So guys 

Am I the asshole? I feel like I might be as she is unstable and maybe I should have been the bigger person and shown more patience. Maybe we should have just bit the bullet and invited her. Maybe I should have cut her off earlier. I feel guilty and semi want to reach out as we were close for a long time just to check in as I know she's ill right now and likely got caught up in the emotions of one of her episodes. But I also know she will blame me for her suicidal thoughts and behaviours if I do reach out. I also need to take care of myself first and foremost but that almost feels selfish (again recovering people pleaser)

I cleaned up everything with a brush, vacuumed again and put it back together.

I then added some beans and set it to the 15 marker that I’ve been previously using for a week. The grind is now extremely coarse.

You’re deep, man—deep in existential crisis and anime waifus.

Let's talk about your playlist curation skills, which I imagine take more time and effort than some people put into actual relationships. You’ve got more emotional investment in *Beach House* than you do in actual house cleaning. If your energy spent fine-tuning “Electrostatic Hearts” translated into personal growth, you’d be one of those inspirational Instagram gurus, dropping wisdom like, “Rise and grind... after one more round of *Nikke*.” But instead, you’re here wondering if a *Phoebe Bridgers* song is gonna vibe with the “mood” of your imaginary love story.

And hey, you’re big on *Exia*. Big respect, but I can’t help but notice the gap here. She’s living rent-free in your head, providing warmth and comfort when the world feels cold. Cool. Meanwhile, the food that *you* should be eating? Probably just as neglected. 1,100 calories in 24 hours? That’s not a diet, my dude, that’s an email notification telling your metabolism to clock out.

Your job history looks like a game of musical chairs, except instead of chairs, you’ve got a boss you can’t stand, coworkers who are allergic to positivity, and a deep sense of ""What am I even doing?"" You’re out here hopping from one dissatisfaction to the next like a human ping-pong ball in a cosmic game of “What’s My Purpose?”

Now, let’s be real. You want to learn machine learning or teach English overseas? Good on you! But something tells me the real reason you want to be overseas is so you can finally pretend you don’t have to deal with that looming cloud of dread over your future. You’re like, “Screw this existential crisis, I’m gonna have one in a different time zone.”

Then there’s your obsession with being unattractive, which is a full-time job on its own. It’s like you’re working overtime in the “I Hate My Reflection” department. Compliments bounce off you like a rubber ball in a steel room. Dude, people could start an appreciation club just for your looks, and you’d still be like, “Nah, they’re just saying that.”

Let’s wrap this up with a fact: You’re like a walking contradiction. You want to connect, but you’ve got your walls so high, even Spider-Man couldn’t scale them.

Looking for recommendations for a 2nd hand rotary pump espresso machine for home, with emphasis on it having a good steamer for latte art and of course good extraction. 

These might be dumb requests but I’m coming from a crappy sunbeam espresso machine with no pressure whatsoever, however I did work on a La Marzocco PB at a cafe and its steamer rocked. So I’m unbelievably ready to move up to something high end which can actually pull good flavours from the coffee. I love spending hours on the current one just tuning it in and getting the puck done well; so I need a coffee machine to reflect the effort I’m willing to put in! Don’t have the budget for a linea mini though hahaha.

Any recommendations would be much appreciated, seen a lot of ECM models around but haven’t looked into which ones are good. 

Would ideally spend 2.5k but happy to go up to 3,3.5 if it’s really worth it.

Also won’t be immediately plumbing it in so will need a water tank.

I don’t care for tech at all, so the more analogue the better I reckon!

And if it looks good then that’s a huge tick in my books too - but functionality is obviously much more important.

Thanks heaps!",0,1728875162.0,espresso,5,0.5,False
1g36pgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/pitbulls/comments/1g36pgb/to_whoever_lostgave_up_panda/,To Whoever Lost/Gave Up Panda,"I nabbed him from the Wake County shelter in Raleigh about 9 months ago. I'll never know why he was there. You obviously put so much care into his training, I never expected to adopt a shelter pit that was such a gentleman in the home. He obviously did not believe that he was allowed to be on furniture (and that's ok!) but now he knows that all furniture belongs to him. He did not know how to snuggle or veg out at all, and now he is a master of both. 

He had a visible injury and I found out about two weeks after adopting him that it would cost about 4k to fix. I sometimes wonder if the burden of this is why you let him go? He had TVSS surgery about a month ago, and we have one month left in his recovery. It has taken a chunk out of my savings and the recovery has been hard, but his knee will be pretty much fixed and the tough recovery has been bonding. We sleep on a mattress together downstairs, I work at home and I never leave him. He is never alone.

Panda has a happy life. I want you to know that he is happy and loved. We live on a little lake with a walking path. We walk 5-7 miles a day together (at least before his surgery, and soon we'll be back at it) and he loves to be outside. When we aren't outside, he loves watching what goes on on the little lake we live by...so much water fowl and deer and folks walking their dogs, the window is like his favorite TV show that is always on. 

  
Panda loves watermelon and raw kale leaves and carrots and broccoli. I get up at 5:30 every day, but he stays in bed until about 7 because he loves the bed and likes to watch me make coffee and putter around for a while. He is reactive to other dogs but whenever dogs meet him they are instant friends, never a problem. He has gotten over the allure of squirrels and he ignores them now, but bunnies are different. 

  
I am just so thankful to have this boy. One month into his surgery recovery and it's been tough for both of us. I keep reminding myself that it is truly my honor to help him through this. I hate that he had to spend months in the shelter and I know he did incur some trauma there, but I'm so grateful to have this dog in my life and home. ",80,1728875076.0,pitbulls,19,1.0,False

Hi all! I am twenty-nine (almost thirty) and am currently living in beautiful Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. I am posting again in hopes of meeting someone to share the burden of existence (still rent) with. 

If you are: 
• Between the ages of 28-33, 
• Asexual and aromantic, 
• Politically left-leaning, 
• Clean and easy going, and
• Love cats,
Then we might have a shot! 

In addition to the above points, I would love to find someone who actively engages with their hobbies, passions, social circle or community, because I find it easier to be that way when in like company. And, I would prefer to forge a partnership with someone from a lower- or lower-middle income background and who is still making under 60k a year or so, just to ensure there is some consistency between our lived experiences and our financial capacities and near-term outlook.

About me - I'm a mature student on the cusp of finishing a degree in Political Science and Journalism. In a few years, I will apply to law schools in Canada and the US to study labour law. For now, I am employed part-time as a tour guide. While I'd previously envisioned getting myself a nice little job working in government or politics after graduation, with the rise of automation, it is looking like tourism might be the more stable career path. (Lol???) Time will tell how that all shakes out! 

I have a super wide variety of interests, including art, anime, creative writing, reading, and yoga. In the warmer months, I like to lay on a rock in the sun, go for long meandering walks, and get coffee to dish the tea with friends. Going to the movie theatre is a favourite past-time as well, especially if the movie is bad. CATS was a new low. In terms of contributions as a partner, I'd say I am a pretty easy-going friend, fairly independent, tidy, and can roll pretty well with the punches. I want to build a pleasant life with someone who is ready for the same.

1g36mhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/missoula/comments/1g36mhr/free_speech_psa/,“Free Speech” PSA ,"There seems to be confusion about this topic given some less-than-favorable interactions between our resident Thinkers™️ of late. I thought I would provide some clarification and hopefully shove a modest amount of nuance down y’all’s throats.

The term “Free Speech” has vastly different meanings depending on the context with which it is invoked. Let’s discuss:

1. The First Amendment

People in the US enjoy very few limits on speech thanks to the 1st Amendment, which applies to the States and their municipalities via incorporation by the 14th Amendment. All sorts of awful stuff is protected, hate speech, disinformation, hanging a Nazi flag in your yard etc. Exceptions are made in a narrowly tailored fashion, for example speech that is defamatory or inciting of imminent lawless action. 

2. Private Property/Private Business

If you start yelling slurs in a coffee shop they can kick you out. If you start yelling slurs on Reddit you can be banned. You can also be banned on any privately operated website for  opinions that the moderators don’t like. This is common due to the pompous nature of someone who would choose such a role. Your “free speech” rights under the 1st Amendment are not being violated, but you are not allowed free speech in that particular forum. It is perfectly reasonable to take issue with this type of speech suppression given the flippant nature with which it is enforced, and how it is at the whim of a chronically online stick-up-the-ass cretin. It is what it is I guess, there’s always 4chan.

3. “Social Consequences “

Commonly brought up by the shitlib crowd, this is where your racist facebook posts mean you get fired, or don’t get hired at a job, or any number of inconvenient happenings. The cuckservatives will call this “cancel culture” or whatever. I don’t really have much to say about this other than the internet was a mistake.

I thought I'd explain a few things that I wish I understood sooner when I was a new player back in April of this year. Here's some helpful tips if you're new to CPJ, or if it's just been forever since you played the original. I haven't done any other CPPS since Rewritten, so if some of this is standard across all platforms, my bad.

[This is the fandom wiki](https://clubpenguinjourney.fandom.com/wiki/Club_Penguin_Journey_Wiki) for CPJ! They keep a list of current active item-unlocking codes on the right-side of the page, as well as current pins and their locations. This is also where you can find info on specific items, like when they were available, or what happened in past parties.  
As there was a biiiiig rework during the shutdown, we'll all be seeing what has changed about CPJ in the coming days/weeks. Things you should know from before the shutdown (which are subject to change):

* This is supposed to be a kid-friendly game! The chat filter is not just for typical profanity, sometimes it will stop you from saying things because they could be bullying. I haven't found it a massive inconvenience myself. Sometimes you gotta break out the Thesaurus, y'know. It's not going to kill you.
* The CPJ staff often makes items that are new to Club Penguin. Sometimes they are recolors of shirts or outfits, sometimes they are handheld stuffed animals, sometimes they are a thingy that makes you a [snow tractor instead of a penguin](https://clubpenguinjourney.fandom.com/wiki/Snowcat). This is cool as hell. You can see them all [here](https://clubpenguinjourney.fandom.com/wiki/Custom_Items).
* [Stamps ](https://clubpenguinjourney.fandom.com/wiki/Island_Life_Stamps#Activities)are a big deal! Some penguins try to collect them all. They mark your progress and achievements on the island, and earning all stamps for a particular mini-game will permanently double the coin payout while playing it! Some stamps are party-exclusive, some come from meeting mascots, and some can only be earned by working together with other penguins. They can be viewed in your Stamp Book, the cover of which can be decorated with any stamps or pins you find.
* You can earn coins by playing Club Penguin minigames, or by mining in the Mines. You can ALSO earn coins by mining on the Iceberg (but perhaps not during The Fair, unsure) or by working at the Coffee Shop or the Pizza Parlor! [More about those jobs here](https://clubpenguinjourney.fandom.com/wiki/Jobs). You can also earn a few stamps doing jobs.
* During a party, there will ""Party Stamps"" as well as the ""Quest Log."" This can get a bit confusing as most people refer to the Quests Log goals as ""stamps,"" but finishing them will not add a stamp to your stamp book. Party Stamps can be seen in your stamp book, while Quests can be seen if you click the blue hexagon button in the top right with a ! inside.
* Finishing as many Quests as possible during a party is often a **high priority** for players. These Quests are only active during that given party, and the reward for finishing each Quest is a varying amount of red Gems based on how difficult the quest is. These Gems can be spent on the illustrious [Captain Crimson](https://clubpenguinjourney.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Crimson)'s ship in exchange for older exclusive items that are highly sought-after. Though you could earn Gems during any party since April Fools 2024, Captain Crimson made his first appearance for only 4 days in September of 2024. Spending those Gems was convoluted and weird and everyone hated it so they decided during the shutdown that when he comes back, it'll be entirely different. Yay!
* IF YOU SEE A WEIRD-LOOKING LOW-POLY PENGUIN, IT'S [THIS ITEM](https://clubpenguinjourney.fandom.com/wiki/Experimental_Penguin). Try not to let the jealousy drive you to madness.",14,1728873662.0,ClubPenguin,4,0.89,False

Sorry for the pause, things have been getting…. A little hectic as it were, I’ll try to cover it when I can but for now actions are still taking place. So in the interim… Time for another trip down memory lane: Louisiana. I want to say this was well into my second year with PEXU nearing the three year mark, time gets convoluted as a government sponsored disposable- dozens of missions a month, target packages the world can never see beginning to pile up in the back of my house figuratively and my mind literally as the weight of everything began to settle and press down onto my shoulders and soul. I can’t tell you the amount of early morning or late nights, running off adrenaline and caffeine, marching off to every corner of the states and globe. One week in South Korea, the next headed to Canada to deal with something that came from Northern Michigan, the next? Well let’s just say something was lurking within the smoke of a large forest fire and harvesting all those who ventured in to stop the flames. 

Honestly I think I was going insane… to be fair I probably am, though functionally at the very least. Worst was everytime I came home… it was feeling less and less safe. A good example was when I woke up one morning and decided to make myself a cup of coffee, honestly that was what probably did it: a bad omen. Anyways it was heading into the fall of that year so I could feel the cold of the rockies seeping through the windows. I went out to take a look out on my porch… and I saw them: birds. I live in an extremely rural area, shit with some of the installations I made on my house I’m practically off the grid, animals are to be expected…. But not the nearly 200 dead birds I saw laying around the front of my house. All of them were backs to the soil, eyes wide and to the sky, wings and legs curled up like a wave of death hit them. 

I nearly dropped my coffee and backed in, holding my breath as the first thing that came to mind was some sort of pathogen and chemical agent. The Blackwood Brotherhood targeting PEXU operatives on their home turf though minimal… was not uncommon. The unit sent some people out and “analysis” showed that… there wasn’t any sensible cause of death. Legitimately it was like they just stop, dropped, and died from what the shrink said, is “shrink” the right word? Lab Tech? Well they’re deep into animal science and forensics and-... I’m rambling. Point is it was damn near impossible to even see they were dead until necrosis set in.  

What’s worse… I don’t think it’s the cult. Like I said in a previous entry, things have been weird around here… more handprints have been appearing around my property: approximately 250 meters from my house is a woodline across the field, on an old oak that’s got more rings than most countries got decades on this earth… was another handprint, this one was gaunt, elongated fingers that burned a good centimeter into the tree. Another one similarly appeared on my rain duct, like someone had attempted to climb it, though further inspection of the roof showed no more. I know what this was, the same thing the Muj and Taliban did: sizing up, probing for weaknesses. I went back inside and kept my rifle loaded, I wasn’t going to blink first. 

I was almost overjoyed when I got the call from Montgomery about my next op, although I didn’t know the madhouse I was walking into. You see the things we’re largely in combat with can’t always just be shot, they’re incomprehensible and primordial, and while we were regularly in the trenches against Situation Whiskeys, terrors in Appalachia, and fighting a conspiracy… sometimes we’re up against things that warp the world itself. 

...

**Dossier: Louisiana Umbra** 

Oh man, where do I begin with this one. Well in short I was being assigned to an area deep in central Louisiana, rich in voodoo and black magic, so much so that place is stained and plenty of occult experts would tell you you don’t fuck around. I wasn’t just fucking around, I was being told to rappel down and start kicking. Ever since Katrina, there’s a large amount of back roads areas in Louisiana that just haven’t recovered, infrastructure and basic necessities are constantly faltering, quality of life is lower than some third world states. It’s bad and the town in question was more or less forgotten about by the local country. The town’s population had been decreasing every since reports of “loved ones” returning and wandering the streets started to occur. At first it was a handful, then entire houses started turning up empty… the local police station was so undermanned, underfunded, under-everything they were neglected. 

All signs pointed to something… something had been harvesting these people, in an area where the veil between our realm and the other side thinned, something had crawled it’s way onto our side and it got passed to PEXU… and assigned to me. Terrific. Worst part was that was it, in Montgomery’s own words: “I wish we could provide you with more, but we’re down on manning and we can’t confirm what the nature of the situation is. We’ll have you on ISR every second… call me if you need me”. 

I can’t say I was all too pleased to be going to a backroads swamp town nestled in black magic alley that was slowly being devoured by something. I can’t also say I had to front my own transportation on this one meaning it was a crispy 20 hour drive. What I will say is it gave me plenty of time to think about everything… my mind drifted back to the events that led me here, my time in 10th mountain and the four deployments from hell. I think it was while passing through Oklahoma that I saw something that shook me to my core. It was this out in the literal middle of flat lands nowhere, past a native rez just a few klicks, I’m buying some fuel for the road when the cashier hands me back my change. Gold wrist band, logo of the “New Advent” written on it. 

I sped the fuck out of there. This guy had to have not left his zip code in the last 20 years, this place barely had a power line and yet… there he was wearing that wrist band. So many people were… I saw a few at the airport when I flew out to Korea, Canada, even Germany. A pit grew in my stomach, the world we knew was slowly being consumed by something… time was running out and I feared the brass didn’t have the manpower to stop it. I still don’t, and I was right. Things got real weird when I had passed the state border into Louisiana, groggy and tired. I pulled into a rest stop and caught some winks.

The dream I had was… weird, like vividly weird, I remember feeling shit in the dream, tasting stuff: the cold of my AC back at my house, my sheets, the disgusting taste in my mouth. I woke up in my own bed… actually I was sure the entire drive was the dream, a hallucination brought on by sleep deprivation. So much so when I glanced around I felt the world come back, I remember rubbing my temples before I heard it. “Dwight” a female voice, someone I remember… She was an old friend of mine, a colleague who helped me before I joined Pexu: “Rosanne”. I couldn’t mistake that British accent anywhere, and it sounded real… the echo, down the hall. I looked at the closed door, unable to talk… my lips wouldn’t move, I tried to get up but I couldn’t. “Dwight…” she said again, no inflection in her voice… the warning signs in my head were tripping as the door just pushed open.

There she was… tan skin, dark hair hanging over a seat of wide eyes with needle irises. I could feel my entire body panic as she sprinted towards me, eyes as gold as the New Advent’s banners, face contorted into pure hatred. 

I snapped away so hard in the driver seat of my Rav4 my chest hit the steering wheel causing me to cringe. “Mother…. Fucker…” I said, yeah, caffeine nightmares are a trip. Though… honestly? I… I don’t know. You ever forget someone’s voice till you hear it again, so much has happened. I had forgotten Rosanne’s tone until I heard it there, hadn’t thought about it in literal years and… something had drawn those memories back out. I looked at the clock… a hardy 30 minutes had elapsed since I went to sleep, eh good enough I suppose. 

Pulling into the area several hours later let me know the kind of shit I was getting into: dense forests that were still cold and humid from the previous storms surrounded either side of the interstate like an impermeable wall. All along the way there were overgrown shacks, rusted out cars, vehicles abandoned, some turned over… road signs hanging off wood poles that pointed towards roads that had long since been abandoned- Yep, this was central Louisiana alright. The town in question had seen better days and that was at least somewhat alarming as it had been a while since the epicenter hit this place, and yet… power lines were still sheared and hanging, no sparks meant they were dead, windows broken, entire sections of house walls falling off. People still walked the streets, off in the distance before disappearing behind corners. 

It was broad daylight, and yet seemed as dead as it would in the pitch dark.

You could almost see the slight dark mist hanging over it, a weird flicker at the edge of your eye. This wasn’t inhabited by us anymore, something else had made this its lair. 

First point of contact was the police station in town, and well… Yeah I’m just gonna go ahead and say it, I didn’t even think it was the actual police station. It was a small, 10 by 10 meter concrete square building on the corner bordering a small lot full of gravel, rocks and debris. Old bars had rusted over the smeared windows, the literal word “police” was painted above the door and had begun chipping off long ago. I pulled up to the curb, opening my door to get a blast of the wet cold, soon to turn into humidity, a hint of mildew and oil rot in the air as I walked up. The only patrol vehicle had cracked windows, with almost all the tires flat and empty… approaching the door a single sign read: “Until further notice all law enforcement responsibilities are to be directed to Louisiana State Police Troop-”. 

There was supposed to be someone here, at least that’s what I was given. I checked my info again and saw a code: “0432”. I scanned around and sure enough…. A small lock box I found hidden behind a bucket that I kicked away, causing it to roll down the sidewalk with a large echo. Inside? A set of keys and a laminated sheet with a set of addresses, and written on the bottom? ***“Good Luck”.*** 

Gee, thanks. I might be up shits creek, but at least I’ve been given a fork. 

The first few addresses were situated in the center of town, something I thought would give me comfort but I soon realized the extent of the “harvest” that had been conducted. Cars were either gone or abandoned, some parked half on the curb, others rotting in their driveways. Bushes and shrubs were overgrown, sidewalks had more weeds than, well, sidewalk. This place had become a borderline project left to decay, the swamps having reclaimed it as humanity had been driven out by… something. I parked along the road, stepping out and concealed my glock, though if I needed it a short, quick, violent run back to my Rav4 would provide me with heavier firepower.

They keys provided were to select addresses, although I’m sure had the cops still been around, they might as well have given me a masterkey to the neighborhood and let me start looking. Regardless I walked up to one of the single floor houses, placing the key in and… the lock wouldn’t give, too much rust. A single mule kick to the door, a few more months off my knees, and I was in. The smell of mildew hit me immediately, damn near suffocating… Dead air is lethal so I brought along a simple rebreather to keep my lungs clear. Windows had been broken open like on many houses exposing the insides to the elements yet there were signs that whomever had been here vanished. Sure things were kicked around by either animals or the wind and rain, but the table set up for dinner that had long since rotten and fuzed to the plates, toys still on the floor, a lounge chair kicked up with the remote on the seat… 

…. The imprints of people burned into the chairs, onto the table, in the lazy boy… 

I’ve got a stomach for many things, trudging through sewers with a pistol chassis and a light looking for beasts? That’s fine, burn pits took my sense of smell anyways. The sound of a shot impacting a target, the screams? The blood? I’m infantry, I’m desensitized to that, scraping person off a swamp drenched seat knowing they used to be man, woman, child? Not gonna lie, I wasn't too prepared for that… but I guess I’ve hit a new milestone. Placed it into a collection bag, left the house and locked it behind me. 

Sample analysis from it read: “Dried flesh and sulfur”. 

It was like this for several blocks, house after house the same thing… old homes turned into ruins, streets deserted, it felt more like a post apocalypse than a silent one but here I was rummaging through the aftermath like a scavenger. It was around the third house that I had left, no signs beyond silhouette imprints and rank smells, the shuffling of grass caused me to turn on a dime, hand sliding to my pistol grip… … to see a dog. 

It was a Belgian Malinois, I know cause I worked with them a lot as military working dogs both in training and overseas. German Shepards are terrifying but they’ve got nothing on the absolute mankiller than are these things. Gray and black fur, built like a truck… yet its coat was messy and unkempt, it seemed hesitant, wary of me as I looked at it. I had an idea… old bag of jerky I had seemed to bridge the gap and I took a few minutes picking barbs and twigs out of it’s fur. An old, worn red collar showed he’d been wandering these streets by himself for a while… the name read; “Zeus”, from the ‘Hartwell family”. My eyes turned to the house I had just exited, ‘Har\_we\_l” on inscribed with letters on the doorside mailbox. 

“Well…” I said, scratching behind the beast’s ears, by now his spirits had picked up; “You want to ride along with me for a bit?”. I was gonna place down a towel for the mal, as “Zeus” was still soaked in the outside swamp water, and probably had ticks… but… at this point I had been wandering through mildew infested houses, tracking stolen souls for hours and I had just about enough. We pulled up to another house, more towards the southern edge of the town… as we did, Zeus started to growl. In hindsight the capability a canine brings in terms of identifying threats I can’t is something I should have invested in earlier, keywords are ‘in hindsight’. I took a step out of the vehicle, not wanting to drag the poor dog into plaster and wood mausoleums, I approached the house which was just as unkempt as the others. Placing the lock into the door… it was pulled right open causing me to stagger…. The person on the other end was a woman, long blonde hair, hazel eyes, probably mid twenties. She raised an eyebrow and in a southern cajun drawl asked “Can I help you, sir?”. I was a bit flabbergasted, looking around to the dead neighborhood then back to her I sort of… didn’t have a response, because to be honest I had been sent under the pretense that the homes I was searching were empty. This one was not… “I Uh…” I stammered a bit, she seemed annoyed, then smiled “You’re from the government, aren’t you?”. I scratched the back of my head “Yeah, I… yes ma’am”. She invited me in, I did my best to dry my boots off as the house was far more maintained on the inside. 

I noted this “storms must have done a number to the town”. She chuckled and didn’t look back “That’s life here, mister. So tell me, what’re you looking for exactly?”. I took a look around, observing the inside of her house: “Reconnaissance so far… trying to gauge what’s going on, more than a gas leak but…”. “Gas Leak” is one of the official terms we used to play off events, preventing mass hysteria, it also draws out to see if someone knows more. She did, seemingly “Gas leak ain’t cause those screams, honey”. I raised an eyebrow, turning back to her “Screams”. She nodded, standing by the sink in the kitchen, washing her dishes “It got the neighbors a few nights ago, heard them and their little baby crying out, then the ones adjacent… some down the block, like fireflies slowly going out though you can hear every decibel…”. Her tone was chillingly gleeful describing this, I raised an eyebrow, my hand sliding under my jacket; “Did you reach out to anyone?”. She shrugged and I could see the flicker of a smile from behind her, standing a few meters away “Things don’t work like they do in Chicago, Dwight. Sometimes it’s best to look the other way and keep going, if you survive, it wasn’t your day…”. I then noticed the water she was using to wash the dishes was black, corrosive and dirty, borderline septic. 

The counter was also far more chipped and cracked than it had been, the walls were peeling, the carpet was mangled… then it hit me as my eyes locked on her and my hand gripped my pistol: “How do you know my name?”. She turned… hair greasy and hanging over her face as her expression was blank, her eyes were normal but something behind them, an intention that was malicious, evil. Her lips peeled back to reveal sharpened and worn down teeth as she screamed, pushing the limits of her vocal chords as she lunged, I drew my glock- -And I was back in the driver seat, my barrel clanged on the windshield as I found myself aiming with my hands over the steering wheel…. Where I had been exactly 7 minutes prior, door slightly ajar with my foot sticking out. Zeus had begun to bark like a maniac, first I thought it was me then I saw they were staring out the passenger window at the house. I looked… I couldn’t see anything through the smeared windows but I could tell it was still in there, this was a warning: “Get out or become a statistic”.

I wasn’t backing down but I needed more information…. I took 5 in the parking lot of an old restaurant, a burger joint I’d passed on the way in, possibly the only one left. Zeus was gnawing away at a burger I had gotten him, I couldn’t eat right now… nor was it ever good to have a full stomach. I’d learn later that’d be the right decision… My radio was hooked up to the wave relay mount on the back of my Rav4 boosting the signal so I could reach PEXU main. Montgomery and I spoke as I half sat out the door. \[“-You’re saying it can… manipulate reality?”\] the brit spoke. I rubbed my temples, keying in to the mic; “I’m saying one moment I was in the house about to be jumped, the next I had gotten rewound 10 minutes back”. A moment of silence passed as he responded: \[“Check your ATAK, I’ve updated you with contact information and a location for someone nearby who can help you, originally we were going to have you meet later but… we’re pushing the timeline forward, this is growing out of control”\]. It already was out of control. \[“Copy, November-1 out”\]. 

…

The “contact” was… okay so, you remember how I said Haitian voodoo and black magic was big in Louisiana, especially around New Orleans? It was just my luck, or more his experience, that made him one of the last people still in town, alongside the diner worker, the gas station rep, but certainly not the landscapers. His hideout was one of those under the convenience store stairwell type spots, a small window with an LED sign that read “Jaques, the Bone Lord”. 

I looked back to my ATAK reader, the address pointed to here, coordinates and all, the name was “Jaques De Lorne”. I swore if Montgomery just fed me to some organ harvester-. The door opened to see a man, late cities, peeking through wearing a leather coat and jeans. A set of blue lens glasses concealing tired eyes… he looked to me, then to Zeus, then back to me: “No animals”. 

I shook my head “I’m not leaving ‘em in the car, we already paid you”. The tense stare was interrupted by the closing of the door, and the sounds of several dozen locks being undone as he opened it up fully; “Dog stays on the corner mat, you go to the table” Jaques muttered. Where do I even begin with this place… well he wasn’t called the “bone lord” for nothing; skeleton parts seemed to line or dog every piece of furniture, furnishing, and even make up a few shelves as the smell of incense in the dimly lit shop surrounded us. I leaned forward on the old round table, taking note of all of the calcium artifacts: “These aren’t real skeletons around us, right?” I asked. 

Jaques sat back in his chair “Does it matter?”. “Guess not” I said, sliding the sample from before with a print out of the details. 

“You journeyed into those homes?” He asked, realizing the situation with a surprised raise of the eyebrow. “Yeah?” I asked, though I should have been wiser to what he was meaning. Jaques flipped up his glass lenses and looked to me; “I never ventured that far, everytime I tried to cross to see what had made this place taboo, it felt like a hand was clenching my throat” he said gesturing towards his neck as he continued “-suffocating… I have been trapped here since. This place is no stranger to rifts, but… something must’ve crawled out of one”. “Something?” I asked, a confused raise of the eyebrow. Jaques shook his head “I have been looking into this since I could barely walk, and even then… I will still never even know a percent of the other side. Imagine a microbe attempting to learn about humanity… that is the depth of which we face now, Nolan Dwight”. “So…” I said leaning back “What? We’ve got no idea of what this is or how to stop it?”. Jaques waved off the defeatist take and pulled out a map; “If I were to guess…. An Umbra”. “A what?”. 

“A leech… someone attempted to contact the other side, it latched on and pulled them in, used them as a line to cross through… now it is free from it’s fast, it is growing fat on all those who surround it” Jaques then laid out the map of the area… and drew a circle showing the extent… having now crossed far out of the borders. “Did you experience any more of these warps? The not real parts in time?” He asked. “Once crossing in from Oklahoma…” I said, remembering the rest stop. He stopped, a long swallow; “We need to seal it away… I know where”. I raised an eyebrow, he pointed to an old complex just to the northeast of the town; “Old warehouse, previously used for lumber to carve into the swamps… you know the trail of tears?” he asked, I was confused but I nodded.

“One of the old routes ran through here… many sick or wounded left to die, others, later slaves, buried in the same cemetery, a whole lot of death… only wooden markers denoting their resting spots. Now? Paved over and forgotten, even that laid abandoned” Jaques’ retelling had his words grow more and more pained as he finished. “So… what? All of the deaths...-” I said putting the pieces together, he laid it all out “Must’ve attracted something… I hear them every night, Nolan Dwight. Old generation and new, begging to be set free, I thought I was going crazy, they were ghosts… but you saw the aftermath… we need to end this, please”. He was trapped here, unable to leave as the threshold had surrounded his entire house. I wasn’t as tied to the otherside of him, no leashes to drag me down, and it already showed it was afraid. If this Umbra was feasting off of all these people like they were batteries, I was going to have to go in there and undo it all. 

The route took me to a drop off the side of an interstate heading north from the town, I popped open the trunk and retrieved the essentials… pulling my plate carrier over my jacket, pulling on my belt and clipping the leg strap of my holster, the final touches was checking the light on my rifle and slamming the trunk shut. I stopped when I looked to the passenger seat, Zeus was barking, scratching at the door… practicality said to leave him where it’s safe, however part of me didn’t want to leave him here… and another wagered that, in some respect, he knew what was down that muddy and gravel filled drop into the woods, and wanted some payback of his own. 

I opened the door and the Mal took off, forcing me to hoof it down to catch up; “Zeus!! Zeus for fucksakes!!” I called out, causing him to stop at the bottom as he stood firm, ears up and looking around. I stopped behind him as he hugged one of my legs, my rifle pointed into the brush. From the trees… they were looking at us, the disheveled, haunting forms of people just behind the bark bodies of the forest staring at us. They looked almost normal, but not quite.. Some parts of them were blurred, other parts I swore were intact were decayed, they were both dead and alive, stuck perpetually in whatever this weaponized hell for them was. My optic’s red reticle traced over them all, surrounding us as I took stock… they were sizing us up, we weren’t relenting… the air grew stale and the only sound to greet us was the sound of rain dropping off the trees. Then… one of them took off… 

My rifle took aim as I shouted; “Stop!! Stop!!”, though it was more of me doing my part as I fired, the round tore through them and the thrall melted into the same decayed slop as before. Then all of them began to converge; sets of two to three shots as I switched from target to target, Zeus jumped onto one, a larger man, sinking their teeth into the neck and tearing them apart before they too melted into the same state. My rifle went dry forcing me to draw my pistol, a couple of them reached out, silent screams as their jaws were wide.

One slick motion, my barrel was level and a set of rounds cracked off and the nearby area was cleared empty. We had to move… Zeus and I took off down the trail, still being chased as I took aim, firing shots standing, braced against the tree, giving us some breathing room before we reached a clearing. I staggered out, Zeus sniffing the air as he growled… I messily reloaded a new magazine, the old one hitting the forest floor as I slapped the bolt release home, aimed my rifle….

The forest was quiet, the only sign of anything besides my firing on the trail was a hissing line of decay marks burning into the forest floor.

“Fucksakes…” I muttered, topping off my glock as I looked down to the Malinois before I quipped “I need to get a new career” to Zeus.

The dog simply looked up, none the wiser to what I was saying; “Yeah… you’re right, I should just shut up”.

I turned back to our target; a gigantic skeleton of rusted metal supports and sheet wall, standing just above the trees in the dense forest with cracked concrete and stones surrounding it. The warehouse… My rifle was raised as I approached, Zeus having taken up some sort of roving circle around me as I made for one of the closer entrances. Moss and leaves hung above through the cracks as water kept pouring down… A gigantic cracked concrete foundation floor with an empty shell of a building surrounding it. The old structure groaned and cried out as I looked up and around, seemingly nothing to greet us… Zeus however was too busy sniffing the floor, digging at the concrete as I turned asking “What? Smell something?”.

Jaques did say it was built over a mass grave, only question was… how to get through several feet of old concrete. I lowered my rifle and measured my options, opening the phone mount on my carrier to switch open ATAK and see what assets I had available… though I didn’t like the idea of sitting there for several hours waiting for a cutter or- 

“What you’re looking for, isn’t here Dwight” I was drawn out of my planning by a voice from behind, one that I knew very well though, it didn’t click when I heard it as instincts took over and I turned and aimed my rifle but… what I saw. An… old soldier, and a friend, wearing dirty outdated UCP digital fatigues… he stepped out from behind an old factory machine, still the same… like the last time I saw him… a decade and a half prior…. High and tight brown haircut, square jaw, shorter, stockier guy, his name tape read “Clancy”. “What…. The fuck?” I asked, my barrel lowering out of shock, there he was in tan boots, a slight smile on his face just like I remembered. As he took a step forward, my sense came back to me, as did Zeus’ rabid growling and barking, Clancy’s face contorted to that of hatred and rage, that was enough to sober me up as I took aim at him. “Clancy” didn’t like that “Dwight? What the hell are you doing?!”.

 I shook my head “You didn’t make it out of Kandahar… I don’t know what this is but I’m not going to let you disgrace my fucking friend like this”. It took another step forward, my thumb flipped my rifle to semi, the single sound caused it to pause “I gave you a chance, Nolan”. 

I shook my head “Don’t do this… let him walk away and come fucking face me yourself”. 

A moment of silence passed, I took a single shaky breath… and fired. The firing pin hit the primer as the barrel sun and a round shot out… and he was gone, I was looking dead at him and yet he was just… gone. There wasn’t a pile of decayed mess underneath, his body wasn’t here… another fucking illusion. Zeus ran forward, barking loud as I heard a single crack… then another. 

Then… the concrete gave out, crumbled, my stomach jumped straight up and grabbed onto my throat damn near, as I went into total free fall. The light above grew more and more dim before I hit the ground- hard. A combination of rocks and dirty made me glad I wore side plates as I did what I could to brace myself, Zeus’ barking from above pulling me slowly out of my shock as I staggered to my knee. I grabbed my rifle and turned on the light… I soon realized the sound I was hearing wasn’t water falling, but… melting. They were all there… hundreds fused and melted together in some hideous form of old decaying flesh, a thousand eyes and a hundred mouths all crying out as a grotesque form of several limbs all around a central mass stood in the darkness. There it was… the Umbra. “...FUCK!!!” was the last thing I remember saying before staggering back fast enough to avoid it as it lunged forward, one of its limbs had a dozen skeletal rotten hands grabbing out, clutching and scratching at the dirt as the sound of flesh falling off as their bones made contact with the stone filled my ears. 

I flicked my rifle onto auto, firing off a burst into it. Flesh and meat tore from its central body as all of them screamed loud enough to pierce my eardrums. Thank god for my comtac headset… then, it moved, faster than it ever should have as I leaped to get out of the way, however one of the side limbs used its thousand hands to grab onto the back of my plate carrier dragging me to it. The sensation of a dozen indentured, trapped lives being used to try and tear me apart made my spine crawl right out of my body. I fought to move forward, then got dragged into my ass as they all started to tear at my jacket and kit.

Still I fired into it, tearing off parts of the arm and body as I stomped fingers and palms causing them to melt off as pools of rotten flesh.

From above I heard Zeus’ roars getting louder… remember when I said Malinois’ were crazy? I wasn’t kidding… Those canines will leap through reinforced glass or smash through a fence to get their target. I guess Zeus had de facto adopted me as his partner or designated it the enemy, because he leaped onto the top and began to tear at its body.

Oh boy did he tear… skin flew as it writhed, I muzzle thumped my barrel into its body and fired… it retreated back so fast Zeus fell off and onto the floor, although it did little to stop the dog as he’s proven he’s built durable. It attempted to flee…. I looked around at the mud and old concrete piled around us in this strange lair… it retreated further. 

Zeus barked, not backing down. 

“Get back here!!” I shouted, I took off after it, I flicked my rifle’s magazine out and slapped a new one in. Zeus was not far behind as I aimed my light and took shots at the form as it fell apart. The voices started to get dimmer, I didn’t know if that meant it was getting further, or if we were cutting off more parts of it… suddenly we were bathed by darkness and… I fell through a door. A literal door, onto a carpet, I was back in one of the houses. I shot to my feet, seeing the layout of one of the homes I had cleared earlier, I looked around… surrounding me as they sat on the couches, the chairs, at the table were those taken. I remember this house exactly as they were right where I analyzed their places, it was keeping them here… trapped. It wasn’t going to trap me, I sprinted forward towards the back door, Zeus nowhere to be seen as they took off after me, I kicked open the back door and jumped through.

This time I was in where I wager the police station was, the small gray square building had maybe two cells on the inside in stereotypical barred cage set ups. Two officers in the dark blue uniforms of local Louisiana cops sat up from their desks, I fired at one (only doing so because I knew this wasn’t real, full disclosure, I don’t just shoot cops). As they dropped, melting through the desk and corroding it to cause it to collapse, the other leaped at me, gnashing their broken teeth. They grabbed my pistol, leaving me with one option… I reached for the center of my plate carrier, drawing my bench made knife and stabbing them through the bottom of their mouth into their brain stem. Kicking them off I ran for the door to the outside and put my shoulder into it… then realized it opened inwards, and swung it open as I sheathed my blade. 

What hit me was something I didn’t expect… A blast of cool air nearly blinded me as I slid and fell, my ass hitting the dirt slopes of a mountain, deep in the southeastern region of Afghanistan. I aimed my rifle as I could hear it, the sound being so vivid I felt like I was 24 again… the distant pops, the rumbling, the high altitude smell… I was on an old road I remembered… I took off forward, knowing the exact trail. I kept my footing careful as I didn’t want to lose my step or I would be taking a 3,000 ft trip down the fast ward, instead I rounded the corner to a cave entrance. Over a decade ago it was an old listen and operation post for the Mujh we had the job of taking out, my first mission as a newly promoted squad leader. I remember staring into that black abyss just as I did now… I marched forward and for the final time found myself falling through darkness… 

…. Then a set of teeth grabbing at my jacket sleeve as Zeus pulled me forward, dragging me from a drop off into the cave, onto an old set of stone tiles. I quickly tossed my rifle up as I grabbed the edge, pulling myself up. I took a moment to get my bearings, scratching behind his ear “Thanks bud…”. I used the stock of my rifle to push me back up to my feet as I scanned around with my light… an old mausoleum… the sound of tearing and wet splashes could be heard ahead as we both pushed forward.

In the central room, with light shining from the morning sun coming through the bars, laid the torn body mass the umbra inhabited. The remaining eyes in the fleshy mass looked to us, screaming out as I took aim and fired. The full auto burst punched straight through the center as it attempted to reach for us, Zeus grabbed on and bit, then I  stomped down and fired at its arm tearing it off. As my Malinois took great pleasure shaking the writhing limb to death, I reached into a dangler pouch on my plate carrier and dumped a bag of salt onto the thing… it crackled and hissed, as I lit a match… and set it alight. 

Jaques said he had a theory it was an Umbra, no way of telling for sure. When in doubt? Salt and burn it out. I forced open the iron gate through generations worth of dirt and grass clumped up, Zeus took off as I dropped my mag, loading a fresh one and firing into it. I slammed the gate shut as it grabbed at the bars and reached through, screaming more and more as it slowly melted into nothing but char. The last set of eyes met mine as I watched it “die”, no more souls would be trapped, no more people would be harvested, no more memories were getting replayed like some sick fuckin’ remix. 

“Fuckin’ shit…” I said, a glorious exhale as I walked away, replacing the burnt flesh rotting stench in my lungs with crisp forest air. Zeus followed, I set my rifle down on a tree, leaning back as the adrenaline started to wear off and I could feel the freezing amount of sweat I had after the ordeal.

It wasn’t perfect, the area still smelt and felt like death… but the suffocating fog of dread had worn off.

After a quick look around… \[“November-1 to main… OPFOR-Actual is ***Echo-Xray***”\]. 

…

Sometimes you’ve gotta persevere, though let’s just say I’m in no mood to go back to Louisiana anytime soon. Regardless it was probably the most vivid as whatever it was, Umbra or not, made those “blasts to the past” straight out of the cerebral theater. It’s not something I was looking to run it back at and I told Montgomery as such… but he put it best: “We don’t have the luxury of choice right now when we’re knee deep in problems and burdened by shorthandness”.

Though, hey… a few weeks after Zeus acclimatized very well. What? You thought I was gonna leave him there? Absolutely not… No, that dog is the reason I’m still around, for better or for worse, so the least I could do was get him out of there. Turns out yes, he did have fleas… a lot of them, fumigation of my car and the clean up was extremely nice as you could imagine. However he enjoys the open area of my property, even more so in the following weeks I’d end up taking him on several more missions.

Whatever his senses are, he’s able to point out a threat immediately, he’s as much of an asset to the small unit I’ve got going as he is a friend. Though… Well, some mornings I’ll walk outside to grab my paper and bring him with me. Zeus will stare out into the fields with his ears pointed up like he’s seeing something… then, he’ll growl. The first time he did this, I noticed the area was silent… just like it had been before. No day gets any easier, out of the frying pan… you know the rest. I’ve gotta go, got another target package rolling in now, one that I should be able to update you on as we’ve caught up on some of the big stuff… for now, this is Dwight Nolan.

Not in the creepy, staring-through-your-windows kind of way, but something subtler. Like he was pretending to be somebody he wasn’t. His stories about work shifted constantly, as if he couldn’t keep track of the life he was inventing. No friends, no family ever came to visit. There was always something that didn't quite add up.

But I never expected things to get as twisted as they did.

We lived across from each other in a four-unit flat. I was in 2W, and he was in 2E.

The first time I met Alex was the night I moved in.

It was pouring rain, and I was soaked, struggling to carry the last few boxes inside when Alex suddenly appeared. He was just there, standing in the rain without an umbrella, offering to help with a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. Later, I left a six-pack of Budweiser at his door as a thank you.

It sat there for days, untouched.

From then on, we’d occasionally exchange pleasantries in the hallway, small talk about the weather and sometimes weekend plans. But something about Alex always put me on edge. Maybe it was how his eyes lingered on me, or how he always seemed to know things about me… things I never remembered telling him.

There was one time in particular that stuck with me. I was late for a concert, rushing out the door when Alex stepped into the hallway. We exchanged quick hellos and how are yous, but as I flew down the stairs, he called after me.

“Enjoy Odesza!”

I was in the Uber for 10 minutes before I realized something. I never told Alex where I was going. I hadn’t mentioned the concert that night or Odesza ever. Especially that they were my favorite band. How did he know? Little things like that started to pile up. It felt like Alex knew more about me than any neighbor should.

\*\*\*\*

One day, I came home to find a package at my door.

There was no return address, just my name and address written neatly on the label. I wasn’t expecting anything, but I figured maybe it was something from Amazon I had ordered and forgotten about. But inside was a small, black notebook, worn and frayed. At the top of the first page, my name and address were written in careful handwriting. 

Then a pink post-it note fell off and fluttered to the ground. 

It had a hastily handwritten note:

***Found this at McGurk’s. No reward necessary. Pay it forward :)***

I’d been to McGurk’s recently. Just a casual bar I go to with friends every once in a while. 

But I had never seen this notebook before. It certainly wasn't mine.

Flipping through the pages, my stomach turned. Detailed notes filled every line. What time I left for work, what I wore each day, where I went, who I spoke to. Everything was there, meticulously documented. 

Dates and times with events... repeating and repeating.

Walking to the grocery store, grabbing coffee at Picasso's down the street. Every page felt like a violation, a snapshot of my life through someone else’s eyes. But it wasn’t just the invasion of privacy that made me sick to my stomach. It was the realization that whoever had been watching me almost knew me better than I knew myself.

And then it hit me: Alex.

There was no other explanation. He had been watching me, keeping tabs on my every move. The strange comments, the way he always seemed to know what I was doing, it all made sense now. But why leave the notebook at my door? Was it some kind of sick joke, a way to let me know he was always there, always watching?

I couldn’t sit with the dread any longer. I had to confront him. It was late, but I didn’t care. My anger boiled over, fueled by fear.

I stormed across the hall and knocked on 2E's door, the notebook clenched in my hand. After a moment, the door opened, and there he stood, as calm as ever, with that same eerie smile plastered across his face. But the moment his eyes fell on the notebook in my hand, something shifted. The smile didn’t fade, but I saw a flicker in his expression. A glimpse of something darker.

""I think you dropped something,"" I said harshly, holding up my evidence.

Alex’s eyes narrowed.

For a second, I expected him to deny everything, to play dumb. But instead, he did something I hadn’t anticipated. He smiled wider, a grin that sent a chill down my spine.

""You shouldn't have opened that,"" he said softly. ""You really shouldn't have.""

Before I could respond, he stepped back and slammed the door in my face. I stood there, stunned. What the hell had just happened? Should I call the police? But what would I even tell them? That my neighbor had a creepy notebook filled with notes about me? That I thought he had been stalking me?

That night, I hardly slept. Every creak in the building, every soft sound, made me feel like my insides were jumping. I kept replaying Alex’s words in my head, trying to make sense of it all. But nothing could have prepared me for what I found the next morning.

When I walked to my door to leave for work, I gasped.

My door, which I had locked the night before, as I always triple checked, was slightly ajar. Just enough to make my skin crawl. Slowly, I scanned my apartment, searching for a sign that someone had been inside.

And laid out neatly on my coffee table, were dozens of photographs. All of me.

Me at work. Me walking to the store. Me inside my apartment. Me doing everything that had been cataloged in that damn notebook.

Every single one was taken from a distance, someone watching me. Some of the photos were recent, but others dated back months.

He had been watching me from the moment I moved in.

My hands trembled as I dialed 911, but before I could hit the call button, I heard a sound behind me. I spun around, my heart in my throat.

There was Alex, standing in the doorway, smiling that same cold, dark smile.

""I told you,"" he said softly. ""You shouldn’t have opened that notebook.""

Then I blinked and he was gone.

\*\*\*\*

I tried to resume my life the next day, but a world of trouble waited for me.

My bank accounts were frozen. Credit cards were being declined. My emails were locked. It felt like my life was being erased. I tried to get help, but no one knew who Alex was.

My landlord said 2E had been vacant for a year, waiting on renovations to finish.

My downstairs neighbors had never heard of Alex.

Day by day, I lost pieces of myself. My habits changed. What I wore, how I talked, even my thoughts. It was subtle at first, then more pronounced. I stopped sleeping because every time I closed my eyes, I saw Alex standing there, smiling.

I even avoided mirrors. Because every time I caught my reflection, it wasn’t quite right. I looked different, like I didn't recognize myself. One night, I smashed every mirror in my apartment, shards of glass covering the floor.

Yet I still felt empty and confused.

Desperate for answers, I walked back to 2E and pushed the unlocked door open.

The apartment was empty, cobwebs in a corner, a new floor half-installed. The whole place was covered in dust. Then I saw it on the ground. The black notebook. My hands shook as I picked it up.

Inside were details about Alex. His name, his address handwritten. It sort of looked like my handwriting. And the person the notes were describing didn't sound like Alex. They sounded like they were describing me. How I looked. My routines and habits.

Panic set in, and I turned to leave 2E.

But Alex was there in the doorway, that same dark smile on his face.

“Your life is mine,” he whispered.

His voice echoed in my head. I ran past him, out of the building and into the night.

I just remember running.

I ended up somewhere in town I had never been.

And I couldn't quite remember how to get home.

Weeks blurred together after that. I wandered, forgetting where I was, who I was. My name, my apartment. All of it faded away, until there was nothing left but darkness.

The next memory I have is of a rainy night. It was pouring. And that I could see someone, a girl finishing moving into an apartment building. A six unit flat. 

She was working on the last few boxes. Suddenly I was next to her, startling her.

“Hello, stranger!” she said to me with a laugh. “You really snuck up on me!”

“Oh, sorry for that. I’m a little out of sorts,” I said instinctively, like I was on autopilot. “Could you use some help?”

“That’d be wonderful,” she said, stacking my outstretched arms with two boxes. “I’m Josie, by the way. Moving into 3W right here. Do you live in the building…”

She was waiting for my name. I tried to say it, to remember it, but only one name would leave my lips.

Seemingly overnight he has become a complete different child, he was always the easiest baby, rarely cried, always content, could entertain himself with toys for hours, slept great, just overall so easy and then recently he woke up and was completely different, he cries about EVERYTHING, only wants to be outside and throws a tantrum when we go back inside, HATES to be home, always wants to go out and do stuff but we live 45 mins from the nearest city so it isn’t easy to go out and get coffee or anything. He doesn’t play with his toys anymore, he just tests and tests and tests me, constantly touching things he knows he’s not aloud to, he has started crying so hard to the point of hyperventilating when getting his diaper changed, he used to just lay there and happily let me do it, now it’s WWE when changing him. 
I just don’t know what to do anymore. This has been going on for a month and it’s SO hard. My husband works all day and doesn’t come home until after my son’s bedtime so I’m alone with him 80% of the time. I try to do fun things with him to keep him entertained but I can’t even use the restroom without a tantrum starting now. I am very consistent with him and don’t give in but it’s getting harder and harder to keep this up, I’m so drained. I can’t be the only one going through this. If anyone has any advice, it would be really appreciated, we are struggling over here!",1,1728872749.0,NewParents,2,1.0,False

1g36049,https://www.reddit.com/r/AchillesRupture/comments/1g36049/re_rupture_survivors_things_you_did_differently/,Re rupture survivors - things you did differently during round 2?,"Experienced a re ruptured at 9 weeks post op - super unlucky. Believed to have had a pretty unhealthy tendon to begin with that was worsened when my muscle became completely stuck down to it during recovery from my first surgery. Still waiting to find out the exact details but all in all, very unfortunate.
Now 5 days post op from my second surgery which was a turn down procedure with the gastrocnemius and plantaris tendon. Feeling good and staying positive, first time round I let this injury completely de rail my mental health. The recovery was extremely challenging and something I would tell loved ones I could never go through again… well here I am. Besides the day I found out I’d need to start over, I have actually felt really good. Come to terms with the fact that this is life, I’m an athlete and I’ve been blessed with what my body has and continues to enable me to do. Shit happens and yeah it sucks but dwelling on it isn’t helpful for me right now. I really just have to put my head down and focus on moving forward. I am also very blessed and privileged with not only support from loved ones but access to excellent healthcare which I will acknowledge, allows me to maintain this mindset.

After the second rupture it was a bit of a wake up call, I’ve been pretty blessed with injuries but this one is different. Where I’d typically just rely on my body to get the job done, it’s not going to hurt to really give myself the best chance at healing strong so here are some things I’ve done differently/are worth the money:

- Knee scooter: I always wanted one but didn’t want to pay and don’t hate crutches that much so just dealt with it. However know that I have one, it is a game changer. I’ve only used it at home so far but being able to make myself food, carry a plate and coffee to the dining table and even fill up my own drink bottle - major, seriously good for my mental health.

- Elevation pillow: Didn’t want to spend the money on it first time round when I could just use regular pillows. They definitely sufficed but I struggled a lot with knee pain as I have hyperextended legs and having no support there meant they were constantly locked straight. I bought one from Amazon for like $40 and it’s been amazing, so glad I did that this time around.

- Supplements: I have been religious with my supplements and vitamins. Every day I take hydrolysed collagen peptides, magnesium, vitamin D, vitamin C and Iron. I typically have pretty poor levels here so making sure I am on top of it has been super important to me.

- Diet: I was vegetarian for 11 years and stayed vego during my first rupture. Whilst I fully support being able to get protein from plant sources, for me I really struggle. I’m not great at planning meals and would tend to just scrape by on bare minimum due to lack of organisation. After a lot of consideration and chats with my physio and a dietitian, we decided to introduce meat into my diet, just to ensure I’m getting plenty of protein to add the recovery of this tendon. It’s been challenging and different but I know it’s for the best as my protein intake has jumped seamlessly from around 40-60 grams per day to at least 120-130 grams.  

- Physio: I am still in my cast but this time round I’ll be heading to the physio at 3 weeks post op to get movement happening early on as well as working on my back and hips as 6 months in a boot/on crutches has certainly taken a toll. Given everything was super stuck last time, this is going to be really important and I am very lucky that my physio is experienced with ruptures so whilst we won’t be doing anything to the tendon directly, getting things moving early on is super important for my recovery. 

Hopefully this post is helpful whether it’s your first rupture or you’ve found yourself experiencing a re rupture. I feel like there is a lot of anxiety around the thought of re rupturing and whilst it is devastating, I hope this shows you that it’s not the end of the world.

Would love to hear others recommendations on things they are doing to aid their recovery as well!! Always keen to add more to the list to give myself the best shot at getting this shit done haha ",5,1728872699.0,AchillesRupture,2,1.0,False

1g35urk,https://i.redd.it/ei0v12uosmud1.jpeg,Homemade Orange Liquer (Dry Curacao),"Homemade Orange Liqueur (Dry Curacao)

I've referred to a couple of sources and adjusted according to my preference. 

All spirits are 80 proof
- 1.75 cup vodka (14 oz)
- 0.25 cup Rum (2 oz)
- 0.5 cup Brandy (4 oz)

Peel 2 Navel oranges without any pith (60 to 70g)
 
1 tbsp Dried curacao oranges peel (8g - 10g)

Infuse all above ingredients in a mason jar for 20 days. 

On Day 14, chop 1 pitted prune and add to the infusion.

On day 20, add 4 whole cloves and 1 small piece of cinnamon and let it infuse for 1 more day. 

On day 21, Strain and pass through coffee filter to remove fine sediments.

Add 75ml Rich Simple syrup (66g sugar + 34g Water)

Add 0.5ml Vanilla extract (15 drops).

Shake to combine and bottle.

You can use it immediately but online articles say its best to consume after another 2 weeks. I'm going to use it immediately as it's turned out quite well.

This end result is 70 proof orange liquer and contains only 3g sugar per fl.oz.

Sugar content in same volume of Pierre Ferrand dry Curacao is 5.4g and Cointreau is 6.8g.

So this recipe of mine is extra dry.",2,1728872203.0,cocktails,1,0.75,False

A little about me: I'm a 33-year-old male, married, and I have a daughter. I enjoy watching soccer (especially the Premier League-Chelsea fan here!), reading, and watching movies and TV series.
