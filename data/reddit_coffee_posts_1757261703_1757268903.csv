1nb0a25,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1nb0a25/reveal_the_best_shaved_ice_machine_ninja_slushi/,Reveal the Best Shaved Ice Machine Ninja SLUSHi Worth It or Not,"Testing the Ninja SLUSHi FS301 has been an unexpected highlight in my kitchen adventures. As someone who loves hosting get-togethers and indulging in unique frozen creations, this machine immediately grabbed my attention with its promises of flavor-packed slushies and frozen drinks. From frozen margaritas during a taco night with friends to kid-friendly chocolate milk slushies for my nieces, I put this machine through its paces. Here's how it held up in my daily use, quirks included.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The Ninja SLUSHi FS301 is an absolute beast in terms of looks and size. Sleek black with premium accents, this machine manages to feel both stylish and seriously functional on my counter. At 24.2 pounds, it‚Äôs no small appliance. I had to dedicate a chunk of space to it, but honestly, it feels worth it for what it delivers. The 88-ounce capacity is impressive, making it perfect for large gatherings. You can whip up drinks for everyone in one go without constantly refilling. Although bulky, the design is intuitive with a simple premium dial and a removable easy-fill vessel that makes the setup painless. The drip tray is a genius addition, especially when the slush inevitably drips mid-pour.

**A Superior Frozen Drink Experience**  
What sold me instantly was the machine‚Äôs ability to transform almost any liquid into a smooth frozen drink. I'm talking wine, coffee, juice, soda‚Äîyou name it. One morning, I threw together cold brew coffee with a splash of caramel syrup; within 45 minutes, I had the silkiest, frapp√©-like frozen coffee. On another occasion, I poured juice into the machine, and in under an hour, I had perfectly chilled and sweet slushies. The RapidChill Technology is the star here. It works by moving an auger around a cooling cylinder to freeze liquids evenly, avoiding that annoying watered-down consistency.  

[Grab Ninja SLUSHi FS301 at the best price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b0d2lzyq2m/)

**One-Touch Preset Programs**  
Tackling the technology behind this machine, the five preset settings are surprisingly versatile. Whether you're attempting margaritas or a smoothie-like frapp√©, these automated programs adjust the temperature and texture to deliver solid results. I tested each one‚Äîmargaritas were frozen to perfection for my weekend get-together, thick milk slushies became my niece‚Äôs favorite treat, and even soda turned into semi-frozen bliss. The settings felt intuitive, though I admit I leaned heavily on the recommended recipes from the included inspiration guide. The temperature control also lets you customize thickness, which was a game-changer when I fancied more of an icy crunch rather than a smoothie texture one day.

**Positives**  
‚Ä¢ RapidChill Technology ensures evenly-frozen drinks without ice.  
‚Ä¢ Handles larger volumes efficiently with its 88-ounce capacity.  
‚Ä¢ Five preset programs make it beginner-friendly.  
‚Ä¢ Dishwasher-safe parts simplify post-party cleanup.  

**Critiques**  
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs heavy‚Äîat 24.2 pounds, maneuvering it isn‚Äôt entirely fun.  
‚Ä¢ Bulk can be an issue if you‚Äôre short on counter space.  
‚Ä¢ Operation speed depends on starting liquid temperature‚Äîa bit slower than expected with room-temp liquids.  

**Competing Products**  
I‚Äôve compared this frozen drink machine to other shaved ice devices and blenders, and let me just say, most competitors fall short in performance. While traditional blenders like the Vitamix can crush ice and deliver frozen drinks, they lack the finesse and convenience of this machine‚Äôs one-touch system. And something like a countertop ice crusher? Forget it‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt consistently deliver the same smooth texture. That said, high-end machines like the Margaritaville Frozen Concoction Maker are in a similar category but tend to focus only on cocktails, while this Ninja model does so much more.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
It‚Äôs not the cheapest gadget on the market, but you absolutely get value if frozen concoctions are a part of your life. The versatility of creating slushies, frapp√©s, and cocktails‚Äîcombined with its large capacity‚Äîfeels fully justified, especially if you host frequently. It‚Äôs effectively three machines in one! Plus, considering the build quality, it feels like an investment that will last years without dropping performance.

1nb06mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/EU5/comments/1nb06mc/underrated_geographically_interested_starts/,Underrated geographically interested starts,"Hello!

I've spent far too many hours staring at maps, so I figured I might as well share what I've learned and collect ideas from you all.

By underrated, I mean nations that are not T1/T2 by flavor and are overall less familiar to the community.  China/Mamluks/Delhi/Vij/Korea are probably simply the strongest, these aren't interesting to discuss though.

By geographically interesting, I mean in the right intersection of terrain/goods/population to be deceptively strong.  I'm using the Generalist's resource tier list to inform which goods are strong, and older maps to find population (unless displayed in a tinto flavor).  Without further ado, the list:

Ma'bar, the Pepper Sultanate of South India.  Vij is the stronger start in the area, but Ma'bar has about the same population (2.6M, similar to Naples or Korea) all concentrated on tropical, flat, grassland. They have 3 pepper directly, silk, elephants, salt, dyes, pearls, cotton, and can expand into other pepper rich regions like Sri Lanka or the south Indian minors.  Hoysala might pose a problem, but there are jungle hills that divide most of your powerbases. Good map color too

Oiniwar, the Silk King of the Ganges.  The Ganges is the richest region in the world probably.  Fine cloth is a wonderful production good and the region has crazy population. Oiniwar has only 12 locations and is contained in 2 provinces, but they are sitting at 2.8 million population.  In these 12 provinces, they have 3 elephants, 2 dyes, a silk, some food and lumber.  The can expand into a wool/lumber/iron rich Nepal, or once Delhi fractures, Oiniwar could expand into a ridiculously silk-dense Ganges.  Subtropical flat grasslands make up their powerbase.  Maybe some demerit for having to wait for the demise of Delhi to expand richly, and Tibet being a tough region to control, but if Oiniwar can conquer the Ganges it probably becomes a top 5 nation for pop and wealth.

Tunis, the next Carthage.  Part of Tunis is Mediterranean, which is the best climate type.  Tunis has a decent parcel of flatland.  Tunis has grasslands, and forests.  Usually forests aren't great, but Tunis has no lumber, so your challenge will be making lumber mills.  Tunis also has wool and dyes.  For this post I dont like mentioning flavor, but per [https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/tinto-flavour-8-28th-of-february-2025-morocco.1730090/](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/tinto-flavour-8-28th-of-february-2025-morocco.1730090/) all Maghrebi countries have a great wool output modifier. Tunis also has just north of 2 million pops, with about 3 million more if you unify the Maghreb.  Wool is one of the best food resources, and cloth+dyes=fine cloth.  Fine cloth+and urbanized high pop core=Money.  Tunis also has an interesting geopolitical landscape.  They can tap into gold trade from west Africa, they can access institutions from Italy, they can steal islands from crumbling Mediterranean countries.  Tunis might be a wonderful start for multiplayer too if they can negotiate with the strong powers off each other.  This is a really dynamic start, might be fun in single or multiplayer

Sindh, the Rajputana gamble.  520k pop is pretty bad.  Arid desert is pretty bad.  Salt and wool is pretty bad for India.  Why is Sindh on the list?  India is poor in one kind of resource, precious metal.  Vij starts with 2 gold in its powerbase (Vij is an incredible start, its ridiculous), and there's one gold in Bengal.  That's it, except for Rajputana with 3 silver (and copper/iron), and I think Sindh is in the best place to push control into Rajputana.  I think in MP this would be tough, but they could also extend into Hormuz/Oman for the pearls.  Silver+pearls in a metal-poor, pop-rich part of the world might mean they have the jewelry market covered. Fun position for the maritime silk road too, maybe they could establish a trade empire. I list them as the gamble because overcoming the population gap in a very competitive region might be tough.  Great map color, might be a really fun SP campaign start.

Huleguids, the Crescent's khan.  Arid desert is a bummer. 1.183 M pop ins pretty good for the neighborhood.  Silk, cotton, sugar are pretty good resources for the area, and someone has to lead the ilkhanate.  If they can push into the Saffron controlled by the Jalayrids, they might be really good.  I think the Jalayrids are stronger, but they are the obvious choice.

Ethiopia, the Mountain Kingdom. Tropical grasslands arent that bad. 816K pop is on the lower end.  Gold is plentiful to the west, pearls and maybe trade to the east, coffee in the middle.  The painpoint is they are divided by mountains, so they have to choose a side, and the dev is painfully low.  Very remote, if you want a turtle kingdom for MP, Ethiopia would be great.

HMs:

Dai Viet.  Too much flavor for me to consider them underrated, but if they can capitalize on the fall of Yuan and/or push into the gold-rich Philippines, they have something cooking.  Great flavor too, military bonuses, control bonuses, and an advantage in firearm production.  They are iron poor though.  Similar to Sindh and India, Southeast Asia is metal-poor outside of Indonesia so their silver and the gold in the Philippines might make it a great market to corner.  1.5 million pop.

Pinya: 591K pop is low and they are hemmed in by a much more populated Hanthawaddy.  Central Burma has an interesting pocket of tropical grassland protected by walls of mountain jungle.  Theres a bit of gold and a lot of gems to the north.  Elephants can be made into ivory, and ivory can substitute gems, so a jewelry Pinya play sits on how much value that one gold can be.  Very cute location, but expansion outside of Burma will be rough.  I really want to like this start, maybe a bit too isolated though.

Majapahit: too much flavor to be considered, islands suck for solidifying market access, and jungles make me sad. Really rich resources and can probably wooden-wall their location.  2.73M pop with much more in vassals and natural expand.  The resources arent as crazy as India, but theres 2 cloves of Java and a bumch of gold/cloves on the other islands.  I think their strength really depends on the final balance of naval control, if its strong enough to ignore the jungle, they are great, else...

Orissa: The other kingdom in India.  1.6M pop directly, I think about 2.8M with starting subjects, and many millions more in natural expand territory.  They live in a massive jungle though which is why they arent on the list, and their direct resources are just okay.  Salt, iron, and elephants are the headline items. Good expansion opportunity into Bengal or even SEA, or south into the region mentioned under Ma'bar.  The question I ask myself about Orissa though is why start them in a play to own Bengal, when Oiniwar has a better starting location and a similar population.  Sea control I guess? Maybe flavor?

TLDR; any random nation in India could be powerful, Tunis, Huleguids, Eithiopia, and southeast Asia have interesting starts.

*When I wrote ‚ÄúThe Day God Answered All Our Prayers‚Äù, I was broken. I was mangled and inverted dissected within God's dissertation on misery. I was burning up inside and out, choking on my sorrow as my lungs gave out on me. I was assaulted by my failure and longing. All the bitter things slithered into my sleep. I had a nightmare, my wife left me, I was hurt and betrayed while my life crumbled in front of me. The cognitive dissonance between love and reality is shrewd and frugal. The interplay of niceties exchanged as currency to buy an illusion. It's a bullish market, stoked by blood-soaked optimism. I invested everything I had into this departure from the unimaginable cruelty of reality. It carried me on wax wings into heaven and I perched upon the pearly gates to await my reward.*¬†



*My nightmare came true, I saw the future unfold twice over and the market crashed. I lost everything in the span of moments scattered across time attached by context. The context was stretched so far it snapped against the present, knocking me into a frenzy. I thrashed like a wild beast against its creator as they were abandoned by every organ in their body. It felt like death, a slow malicious death that carries no comfort with his scythe. I wrote the series under a different name originally, before it saw the light of day. Oblivion, The state of being unaware or unconscious as to what is happening. My little apocalypse, my test of faith, I was venting. The horrors I created of a bored God. The Eldritch God beneath the veil of holy Scripture sleeping away millennia. Avoiding the sight of Its creation, but dreaming evermore. Shuffling the problem to a future that didn't exist to wash away later.*¬†



*I was waiting for the rain to come. That storm carried by the wind to bring me comfort and euphoria. I stood in the rain, but it never dared to touch my skin. I revolted against circumstance and begged for the addiction to Heaven to set me free at last. It burns in my body today regardless of the withdrawal. Absence is a powerful teacher for an addict. The acceptance of Hell for shallow safe places that hold your delusion in warmth. I became tortured by my arrogance. The shame of failure wrecked me. I'm irrationally afraid of failure. The dynamism of my attitude in the face of defeat revolutionized the depth of my ignorance. I was in a new era of discovery and journeying backwards through history. Once I'd arrived at the starting point I found an inconceivable circumstance. My arrogance chained me to the abyss of my soul, swallowed within Oblivion buried deep into my muddiest waters.*¬†



*I found a door in my life that wasn't there prior, when I opened it I saw peace. I saw resurrection like the burning of my spirit was the kindling of Phoenix ash. The kindling of my seizing body on a flame of mockery. The creeping of my veins from my arms to my throat, to cut away at the skin and flesh that imprisoned them. Once I'd written part five the pain dulled by my exploration of it through horror. I took steps deeper into my pain and sat with it. I poured my soul into the words of strangers from worlds I personally tortured. I was bored so I answered all their prayers. I bound them in conveniently packed sets of reverberating circumstances. All echoing the traces of their scorned God.*¬†



*The beauty of the irony poured out of me onto page after page. I felt the weight of it all driving creation from my tongue. Lethologica, the last lamenting piece of my psyche, refused to forgo Oblivion. It was The Devil watching me in the corner of my room only ever asking one question, ‚ÄúPray On It?‚Äù. I heard it call to me day in and day out manifested within the spaces between. The place where the eyes of an idle God peaked at me through my waking state. I kept tapping on Heaven‚Äôs door to beg for crumbs of inspiration. I harassed a sleeping god to let me relinquish more of my humanity. I enacted ritualistic adherence to small dark words whispered through my hands mirroring creation. I prayed, ‚ÄúPlease God, give me back my love‚Äù.*¬†



*The night after I called to the void, it was mute. God Answered me with Its face. The eyes wore faces intersected by the colors of emotion. These colors didn't exist where I'm from. They croaked and groaned with torn vocal chords speaking words that created change. They deceived me with the truth and swayed me with their antiquity. They innovated on the concept of what I could conceptualize. Bolstering the connection of my soul to my pen. They overrode the code behind the illusion of art, and imbued my fingers with creation. The faces upon God‚Äôs eyes opened their mouths with finger-lined gums beckoning my attention. My attention became my astral suspension in a fractalized universe. The tongue of God was a collection of chattering teeth squelching and squeaking forever. My floating essence was ground up by those teeth.*¬†



*I sank and rose simultaneously, violated by the small print of God's favor. I awoke swimming in the stress of my body. The gift of my first breath came with a migraine. I found the meditation on my situation verbalized in my notepad. It was titled Oblivion. I read part one, this story of Barbara watching her community consumed by the pores of their skin. I have severe trypophobia, the imagery and cruelty at play made me nauseous. I wrote that? Up to that point I was a published poet, giving rhythmic sermons of insurmountable odds on a mound I stacked. I never knew there were tentacles under that soap box. I was nobody on the ground and everything on the mound. I felt then as if my hand wasn't mine. I found myself typing the story into Google docs. I then caught myself in a fugue state editing and posting it to Reddit.*¬†



*I was possessed without recompense by what I called inspiration. My trials and tribulations painted the world yet again in the shade of Me. All I could see was what I wanted. I wanted to finish the series, hell I needed to finish emptying my tank of frustration. I slept and the nightmares left my bedroom. The morning after again for nearly a week straight. I'd find the work of the flesh of my hands and horrors of my mind. I don't remember writing a single godforsaken word. It didn't matter tho, I obsessed over the upvotes and views and comments checking daily. I needed praise and worship for the suffering of my creation. I needed validation for the everlasting pain I inflicted upon my fiction out of boredom. In my sleep I heard the voices call to me. The evidence of my answer on my desk. I didn't understand the nature of The Lord back then, but I do now.*¬†



*The first day that the series was finished, prologues and all I celebrated. I sat alone with my last half gram of weed rolled slowly and deliberately. I poured my coffee into my favorite mug and the process was my meditation before mediation with myself. I felt like I was going to be the next horror icon. Everyone would love my depictions of suffering and my vignettes would all be married into a history of great dark things. All born from the tips of my fingers, and the complexity of experience. I was about to blow up, and I couldn't wait. If my bad dreams come true shouldn't the good ones too? I expected an expedited reparation for the love I lost in the form of social currency. I just wanted to see the number go up. The proof I was loved, ricocheting across the barriers of my narcissism.*¬†



*Emboldened by strangers who shared my cosmic sadism. I was almost correct in my assumption. I was emboldened, recognized, and bewitched by something that shared my cosmic sadism. Once I'd returned to my bedroom to rot in my bed. I found a door, under my back, in my bed, that was seriously uncomfortable. It opened up under me and plunged me into the aftermath of one of my abandoned worlds. I saw Jimmy, he was just a smear now. I couldn't comprehend the situation, but I knew where I was. Whether dreaming or having a psychological break, I wasn't sure, but that smear was Jimmy.*¬†



*His last words etched into the concrete floor of Mrs.White‚Äôs cursed dungeon. They wriggled and the remaining visible color of his being took deep breaths threatening to leave their canvas. Thankfully considering the circumstances I knew the way out traveling as fast as I could up those stairs into the wrong living room. It was covered in colon coated human residue. The smell held my throat hostage only allowing one breath to escape per demand. It dragged me to my hands and knees by my larynx, muffling my failed attempts to grasp for two simple words. I woke up in my bed, seriously questioning the strength of that blunt and experiencing the relief of surviving an intimate meeting with death. I've never crashed into a nightmare so seamlessly.*¬†



*It was something I'd expect if I lived on Elm Street, but the serious lack of a burned predator ruled out that nightmare. I questioned whether I was just traumatized and I'd gone completely cuckoo for cocoa-puffs. Maybe I'm just trippin, and need to drink some water. I might've even touched a strand of grass, but my bubble burst real fast. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù, escaped my lips as I gripped my covers to ensure that reality was indeed real. My mouth was dry, my sweat was cold, and there was a face on my ceiling. It sang to me, first it sang¬† ‚ÄúI received the Living God, it's eyes sprouted mouths to sing ‚ÄúGive me a Clean Heart‚Äù,¬† Tongues hung out those mouths bitten bloody, but never separated singing ‚ÄúAne Parthene‚Äù, The rest of the popcorn ceiling had every Individual imperfection open into a hole from which echoed ‚ÄúI Smile‚Äù and the songs fought for dominance in my mind. Each one a spider with legs that split into two and continued until the legs overtook the body of the spider. Every leg of every song attempted to crawl in a different direction while the body stayed sinking into my brain.*¬†



*The metaphor manifested once the legs of the many spiders started to grow from my nostrils and my mouth. My ear drums perforated, but I could still hear the music. My favorite hymns and gospel music spread the will of God along my body until it too was overtaken. The music came with a background track of whispers. They asked me,‚ÄùDo you feel the love now?Can't you feel my love, son? Why aren't you happy with your blessing?,Why don't you pray on it?‚Äù.¬† My eyes were gone, my body was full, and my mind had imploded. Yet I still heard the music and the whispers. The legs wrapped around my bedframe tightly binding me to my position. They flicked and prodded each other all over me. Interlocking and grinding while the fibers of their hairs create a harmony with the sounds of swarming pests. I stayed like that for days until I woke up again.*¬†



*I've been here for a long long time, and I am so goddamn tired. I'm so empty and God's love finds new ways to enter me every day. I'm alone and I'm still grieving. The pain that nurtured my art is the ammunition of my torment. I've had my darkness flipped back on me. Hollow in receiving my infinite blessings. I'm writing this as one last prayer, one last thing for God to answer.*¬†



*Me (My name is Art) : Can I be forgiven for daring to try, and find an escape from this prison of my recreation? Are you satisfied yet?¬† If my Creator has forsaken me, can I forsake existence?*¬†



*The Writer (Also Named Art) : Honestly I was never bored. I wasn't inspired, I wasn't great or incomprehensible, It's simple, I am, Therefore, You Think You Are. I had nightmares night after night genuinely for years either nothing or a dreadful disjointed nightmare. My worst fears flaunted themselves in front of me for years. I overcome the weight of those fears everyday. The price is simple, all I have to do is keep dreaming and when I look at those dreams when I awake, they're always disappointing, but I dream anyway. I touch the pillow with my head and close my eyes, because maybe this won't be a nightmare this time. My optimism is fueled by the suffering of my creations. If you exist to torment everyone. You can no longer torment me. I'm sorry but I'm having the hardest time, having a good time.*¬†



*Me:¬† Oh‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶this is goodbye then?*



*The Writer: I won't speak to you again, no, but at least your story is over, I can't think of anymore tortures to pen*



*Me: What about everyone else, what about you, are you the final layer? Or is there something writing your story?*¬†



*The Writer: I don't know, not every writer is hacky enough to talk to their characters*



*Me: Omnipotence means Omnipotence, I hate that you find so much depth in something so shallow*



*The Writer: It's true, you never were free, you never will be free, I created you, I noticed you, and the rest is up to me, Goodbye Forever Art, I really need to sleep‚Ä¶\[Final Part Close\]*

i got a barista job 3 weeks after working at starbucks for a year when i was 16 (im 19 now). because of this, it feels like im just getting used too making food and drinks again and can get rushed/make stupid mistakes. i kept asking for feedback from everyone, and they just told me since im new its not that big of a deal. the thing is im really good at taking orders, getting drip coffee/food, helping out, etc. especially in rush hour + make a lot of tips. recently my job hired 2 new people and im going back to uni, and our cafe is next to a highschool. so i got a text from my boss saying hes putting me in a ‚Äúparttime/oncall role‚Äù just because schools back in session and the new hires have more experience than me. i didnt get scheduled at all next week. 

i dont know if i should be worried or not about losing my job. 

the most demoralizing part is that it took me 300+ applications and over a year of job searching. it feels like someone gave me a cookie and ripped it out of my hands before i could eat it. i also kind of feel left out and singled out even though its just a job, since all of my coworkers and even customers get along really well with my boss. i replied very kindly and asked if he could consider me for thursdays and the weekend, but never got a reply. i should also mention another girl started around the same time as me but her shifts are completely normal. should i start searching for another job or even talk to him in person? what could i say? advice is appreciated :)

But it changed in one year after an incident with a train crash, causing hundreds of people to get injured. The incident caused an uproar against superheros it took one incident to change the public view of heroes. The government forced superheros into hiding for years.

It's a rainy evening in a cozy bar. The atmosphere is filled with the smell of cheap beer and the sound of jazz. In the back corner of the bar, Jack sits down and orders a coffee, reading the newspaper. He noticed that one of the superheros he knew Macro bust had gone missing. He lives a normal life with a bad job in a car dealership. He changed his identity to Jack Thomson. He drank his coffee paid, walked out and got into his car, and drove home.  When he opened the door.  There was a tablet on the table suddenly. The screen turned on a beautiful woman named Mirage she said, "" Hello Jack Thomson, or should I say Gamma Jack, my name is Mirage, and I have a mission for you call this number 140 457 684 if you except the mission. Jack quickly took the number on a page he would do anything to relive the glory days of superheros, and then the tablet exploded. 

A few days later, he was able to find a way to the mission by taking a private jet. And given the rundown of the mission, it's been a long time since he has worn his superhero suit. The mission was to destroy a robot on an island raking havoc  upon the facilities on the island, and he was dropped onto the island. It was bigger than he imagined running through the thick jungle he was suddenly ambushed by the robot it was bigger than him, and the robot tried to crush his head on a rock, but Jack easily destroyed it by blowing it up and disabling it's mechanical legs. He started to wonder how he was going to get off the island.

 But another robot ambushed him, but this time, it was bigger and stronger than the other one. He tried to destroy it in the same way as the other one. He released a radiation explosion, and the explosion emitted lots of smoke. Jack believed that he destroyed it and started laughing. The robot came out of the smoke undamaged. Jack was shocked he panicked and started to run, but the robot grabbed him by his cape and threw him into a tree, breaking some of his bones, stabbing him in his shoulder, picking him up and throwing him into a rock, and stabbing his chest and now coughing blood. He realized that Mirage set him up to be killed by the robot and with that final thought going through his head. He self destructed, leaving nothing but his lower part of his body with the top missing covering the rock and robots limbs in blood and chunks of body pieces.

Long walks, cozy evenings, snow and daydreaming about impossible things are my idea of bliss. 

I‚Äôm more of a homebody than a party-goer. I believe in building a warm, peaceful life with someone who values the little joys.

I also strongly believe in the power of attraction, the idea that what we focus on shapes what we create in our lives.

I‚Äôd love to connect with someone kind, emotionally mature, and thoughtful, who‚Äôs also CF and values partnership over ticking society‚Äôs boxes.

I am writting to you in behalf of my mom. 20 years ago, my cousin, the only child of her sister, died tragically and brutally at 22yo. Two days ago it was his anniversary and my mom was at my aunt house to keep the dogs (while my aunt was away). Around 5pm, the electricity went off briefly then when coming back 3 machines started to work (oven light, cooking robot and the coffee machine was pouring water). My mom thought nothing special of that. 

Then between that moment and 10pm, the bell rang 3 times, with no one on the camera (they live in a remote place, with no one passing there). 

When she went to bed around midnight she opened her phone to play Scrabble. The 7 letters given to her (randomly by the computer) spelled exactly the name of my cousin. She was shocked and went to speak to him near his ashes and picture. 

My mom isn't someone who believes in paranormal and my aunt is even more ""rational"". 

My question to you is what to do with this ? To me it seems strange to receive this type of manifestation 20 years after the death. What are your thoughts of this ? Thank you. 

Ps: several years ago my aunt received two phone calls from my cousin's, two years appart, with no one responding on tge other end. And when trying to call back the operator said this mumber wasn't in service.",2,1757267579.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm M(25) in a relationship with my gf (21). At first it was all going well but later on few instances happened that made me lost my feelings for her like she fights when i check/usually look at  her phone. But she checks mine very often. And few more instances that she lied about but i know that she lied but she doesn‚Äôt know that i know. She‚Äôs very insecure about a female friend of mine but there‚Äôs nothing between me and that female friend. We‚Äôve been friends for more than 5-6 years and still we are very good friends. 

So one day my friend texted me asking for coffee or walk after the office. ( both of our offices are nearby). So i said okay. It was just a casual meeting as usual we talked about mutual friend and went for a walk. So when i met my friend while my gf was in Malaysia. So if i would‚Äôve told her about it toh she‚Äôd fight and eventually ruin her trip herself.
So i didn‚Äôt told her that i‚Äôm meeting her.

I just want to breakup with my gf but i don‚Äôt know how to do that. Like i‚Äôm not really good at talking or saying anything upfront. I recently had a fight with her and i was about to break up but the she was going on a trip to malaysia the very next day so i thought i‚Äôll tell her when she‚Äôll come back cause it‚Äôll eventually ruin her trip.

And when she came back she got to know about that i met my friend from the chats. I don‚Äôt hide my phone as i know i didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. So she‚Äôs upset about it but i‚Äôm the one to blame rn. If i‚Äôll break up now then she‚Äôll blame me that i‚Äôm breaking up cause of my friend than there‚Äôs something going on bw me and my friend.

Once when she was using the bathroom i happened to check her phone and i opened snapchat messages of her best guy friend. When i went to media section i saw that she had shared half nudes with that guy. So these things made me lost feelings and i don‚Äôt know how to confront about it.

What happens is it plans, starts working, kinda ignores the subagent bit, and only after I nudge it again it seems to fan out. Now I‚Äôm seeing lines like `Task(Create wallet transactions page) Done (7 tool uses ‚Ä¢ 31.4k tokens ‚Ä¢ 2m 29s)` and similar. As below:

does that actually mean subagents were spawned, or is that just a single agent running sequential tasks and logging them as Task() blocks? I started in Opus Plan Mode. Curious how u‚Äôre all doing this in practice.

It acts like a private tunnel, shielding your data from hackers, internet service providers (ISPs), and even governments.

One of the main benefits of using a VPN is **online privacy**. When you connect to a VPN, your real IP address is hidden, and your internet traffic is routed through a remote server. This makes it much harder for anyone to track your online activities or determine your location.

VPNs are also widely used to **bypass geo-restrictions**. For example, if a website or streaming service is blocked in your country, a VPN can make it appear as if you're browsing from a different location, giving you access to content that would otherwise be unavailable.

In addition, VPNs are essential for **security on public Wi-Fi**. Coffee shops, airports, and hotels often have unsecured networks, which are easy targets for cybercriminals. A VPN encrypts your data, protecting sensitive information like passwords, banking details, and personal messages.

While VPNs aren't a one-stop solution for all privacy concerns, they are a powerful tool in maintaining a safer and more open internet experience. Whether you're working remotely, traveling, or just want more control over your digital footprint, a VPN is a smart investment in today‚Äôs connected world.",1,1757267234.0,BlogExchange,0,1.0,False

My name is Daniel and I'm from Southern California (the Inland Empire, specifically). I'm just looking for someone to have a genuinely great time with. I'm not a very picky person and I don't really care much for looks. I more so value your personality and how well we vibe, so pretty much anyone is welcome to get to know me!

My interests:

~ I would consider myself the typical nerdy type (gaming, anime, comic books, super hero movies, etc.) If you like share any of those interests then I think we'll get along great lol I also build Lego sets.

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

~ I listen to any kind of music except country cuz it all sounds the same to me lol. So if that's a deal breaker then I apologize but I just can't get into it. I also used to rap and sing and have been thinking of doing it again. I have made about 9 or 10 songs in total. Let me know if you'd like to hear something I've made.

~ I love coffee and boba so random coffee and boba runs will be a thing. One of my favorite things to is visit a coffee place I've never been to and try out their coffee and see if I'm adding it to my list or favorite spots or if I'm just never going there again.

1. ""Let‚Äôs flip the lens on this‚Ä¶""
Instead of ‚Äútell me about X,‚Äù ask ‚Äúlet‚Äôs flip the lens and think about X differently.‚Äù

This forces AI to ditch cookie-cutter answers and get creative ‚Äî like switching on a different brain.

2. ""What‚Äôs hiding in my blind spot?""
Ask: ‚ÄúWhat am I not seeing here?‚Äù

Suddenly, AI stops agreeing with you and starts poking holes. It finds assumptions you didn‚Äôt even know you were making. Gold for strategy, planning, or risk checks.

3. ""Deconstruct this for me, professor-style.""
Say: ‚ÄúBreak this down for me, step by step.‚Äù

Even for simple things ‚Äî instead of ‚Äúhow to make coffee,‚Äù you get the physics, the technique, the rituals. It moves from surface answers to full-on masterclass.

4. ""If you were me, what would you actually do?""
Ask: ‚ÄúWhat would you do in my shoes?‚Äù
AI shifts from being a neutral helper to a decision-making partner. Instead of bland advice, you get actionable judgment calls.

5. ""Here‚Äôs the real question‚Ä¶""
Follow up with: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôm really asking‚Ä¶‚Äù

Example: Instead of ‚Äúhow do I get promoted?‚Äù try ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôm really asking: how do I stand out without looking like I‚Äôm trying too hard?‚Äù The answers suddenly get way sharper.

6. ""What‚Äôs the catch?""
End with: ‚ÄúWhat else should I know?‚Äù

 This is the secret sauce. AI starts adding warnings, context, and ‚Äúaha‚Äù details you‚Äôd never think to ask about.


The Stack Trick
The crazy part? You can stack them into one monster prompt:
""Let‚Äôs flip the lens on this. What‚Äôs hiding in my blind spot? Break it all the way down for me, professor-style. If you were in my shoes, what would you actually do?

 Here‚Äôs the real question I‚Äôm trying to solve: [insert]. And finally: what‚Äôs the catch I should know about?""

Sam's mouth had the metallic taste as she bit the inside of her cheek.
How many times did she overhear girls like Paulina wishing to see Danny Phantom shirtless and here she was doing her best to cover him.

The night was supposed to be a little date, Tucker had to help his family deal with moving a member to a nursing home, the Mansons were in Japan about a possible business venture, and the Fentons were in the newest Ghost Hunting convention.

Skulker and Technus had attacked him and were giving him a hard time when the GIW decided to join in, her twin blasters had overheated nearly burning her hands.
After both ghosts were captured and the agents were either in jail or the hospital.

Danny could barely walk straight and the rings washed over him.
Bruises, burns, broken glass, pavement, and a rusty nail decorating the body.

The sidewalk was the absolutely the worst place to treat injuries but beggers couldn't be choosers.

Taking the junk carefully was horrible wandering if someone was going to attack an injured Danny or discover the secret.


After the last piece of metal was removed, a presoaked rag was applied as she cleaned each wound that was permanently added to his body's macrabe scoreboard.

She had wished that they hadn't begun to watch the mummy movie as she felt like she was preparing Danny for his eternal slumber.

Tears ruined her makeup and the taste of coffee was used to forget about the blood, a phone call to Ida to get help to bring Danny home was never easy as she considered him her grandson in law.

""Ida, I need a car to get Danny back home""

""What happened?""

""Skulker, Technus, and the GIW""

""Say no more"".

A few minutes later a small black car arrived and the driver helped put the injured hero in the back seat as Sam sat down and put his head in her lap.

They arrived at the mansion and put them in an empty bedroom.
Despite not being her style she clung to him afraid the reaper would take him away from her.

I‚Äôd stay up way too late, eat like garbage, and swipe my card for anything that made me feel better in the moment. My ‚Äúbudget‚Äù was basically hoping the account didn‚Äôt hit zero before payday. I was making about $2,900/month after taxes and somehow still had less than $200 left in my checking at the end of each month.

I got sick of feeling like I had no control, so I forced myself to start small. First rule: cook at home at least 4 nights a week (saved me about $150/month). Second: write down *every single expense* in a notes app, no matter how small or dumb it felt (realizing I was burning $80‚Äì100 a month just on random snacks/coffee was a wake-up call). Third: no credit card, only use my debit card that reports to the credit bureaus so I couldn‚Äôt spend money I didn‚Äôt have.

It felt pointless at first, but it snowballed. Cooking at home saved money, tracking expenses made me think twice before buying, and the debit card gave me peace of mind because I was actually building credit while sticking to what I could afford. Fast forward 6 months, and I‚Äôve got $1,800 saved in an emergency fund, my credit score climbed 45 points, and I don‚Äôt panic every time I check my balance.

Mist hovered around, making it difficult to see even five feet ahead‚Ä¶
A cold breeze cut through the mist, raising goosebumps on exposed skin.

A man walked slowly, his silhouette sharp against the fading light, each step deliberate but light, as if savoring a familiar path. His face remained hidden, a shadow drifting through the fog, his gaze darting across the road. Then he stopped.

A bike headlight cut through the mist, golden rays revealing a woman standing by a large banyan tree‚Äîher scarf caught by the breeze, posture curious, almost lost.

He approached, his heart thudding like a young man seeing his first love.
‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù he said, voice warm, teasing, as though about to share a secret.
‚ÄúYou look a little lost. Need a guide?‚Äù

She turned, eyes bright but guarded, a playful smirk tugging at her lips.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, thanks. And, uh‚Ä¶ I'm waiting for my boyfriend, so‚Ä¶‚Äù She raised an eyebrow, testing him.

He chuckled, low and easy.
‚ÄúA boyfriend? You look way too young for that. Might even be illegal.‚Äù
His tone light, flirty, tossing a spark her way.

She laughed, her guard softening, cheeks flushing.
‚ÄúOh, please. I‚Äôm Rashi. I‚Äôm 23. Definitely of legal age to have a boyfriend.‚Äù
She crossed her arms, daring him to keep up.

‚ÄúRashi, huh? Nice name. And don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm of legal age too.‚Äù
He winked, leaning in just enough to keep the moment alive.
‚ÄúName‚Äôs Dina, by the way.‚Äù

They laughed, the sound mingling with the evening‚Äôs hum.
It felt easy, natural, like a dance they‚Äôd done before.

‚ÄúSo, Rashi,‚Äù Dina said, hands shoved in his pockets,
‚ÄúSince we‚Äôre both legal and all, how about a coffee? There‚Äôs a spot just around the corner.‚Äù

She hesitated, then shrugged, grin mischievous.
‚ÄúOnly if they‚Äôve got my favorite.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey do,‚Äù he said too quickly,
then caught himself with a grin, ‚ÄúI mean, they have everything.‚Äù

At the caf√©, he ordered a filter coffee with extra sugar and cheesecake.
Her eyes lit up when it arrived.
‚ÄúHow did you know that‚Äôs my favorite?‚Äù she asked, half-laughing, half-suspicious, stirring her coffee.

‚ÄúLucky guess,‚Äù Dina replied, smile soft, almost secretive.

She talked‚Äîabout Jane Austen‚Äôs spiritual musings, aching songs, the sound of rain on a tin roof, teasing a radio jockey.
Her hands animated, laughter spilling out like it was the first time she‚Äôd shared these things.
He matched her energy, quipping about Pride and Prejudice, humming lines from a classic tune, every response perfectly in sync.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kinda perfect to talk to,‚Äù she said, sipping her coffee, gaze lingering.
‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, like we‚Äôve done this before. D√©j√† vu.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe we have,‚Äù he teased, voice weighted in a way she didn‚Äôt catch.
‚ÄúIn a parallel universe, perhaps.‚Äù

The caf√© lights dimmed, signaling closing time.

‚ÄúCome with me,‚Äù he said, standing, hand extended.
‚ÄúI want to show you something.‚Äù
She took his hand, interlocked her warm fingers in his, and followed him. 
He led her through the streets to a small house tucked behind banyan trees, the familiarity of the path striking her as strange, yet comforting


Inside, it felt like a memory‚Äîcozy, lived-in.
Photos covered the walls, spiritual books and trinkets scattered around.

He led her to a bedroom.
She sat on the edge of the bed, kicking off her shoes with a grin.
‚ÄúThis your move, Dina? Bringing girls home already?‚Äù

He laughed, shaking his head.
‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ wait here. I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù

In the hall, his breath faltered.
His fingers trembled as they found a bottle of pills.

Her eyes widened, a flicker of confusion and a faint spark of memory warring behind them as they landed on the photo on the nightstand.

 A young couple, radiant. Her in a red lehenga, him grinning like he‚Äôd won the world. Her own smile. His face, but... younger. Unlined. Her gaze flicked back to the man beside her, to the silver in his hair and the weary trenches around his eyes. The pieces refused to fit together, a painful riddle she couldn't solve

He wasn‚Äôt the young man she‚Äôd been flirting with.
Not anymore.

He handed her a pill and a glass of water. His hands, which had just moments ago felt strong and certain, now trembled slightly. The routine was etched into his soul, a daily act of love and loss.

She looked deep into his eyes, frowning, confused, but took it.
Swallowed it with a sip.

Her eyelids drooped.
He helped her lie down, tucking a blanket around her.

Her face, now bathed in the soft glow of the bedside lamp, revealed the same truth‚Äî
Gray streaks in her hair, gentle wrinkles framing her smile.

‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù she murmured, voice sleepy,
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave me‚Ä¶‚Äù

He pressed a kiss to her forehead, eyes stinging.
‚ÄúI love you too, Rashi. Always.‚Äù

He closed his eyes and prayed to the universe:
Don‚Äôt take my life before hers.

The clock ticked quietly.

Tomorrow she might forget. But by the banyan tree, in the hush of mist and memory, he would find her once more. He would smile, tilt his head, and ask: ‚ÄòNeed a guide?‚Äô And she would laugh, as if it were the first time. 

For him, it's one more chance to love her again

1naz9gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trendinfo/comments/1naz9gl/the_ultimate_2024_showdown_aliexpresss/,üö® The Ultimate 2024 Showdown: AliExpress‚Äôs Mind-Blowing Bargains vs. Amazon‚Äôs Lightning-Speed Convenience ‚Äî Which Side Are YOU On? ‚ö°üõíüî•,"Okay so here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been living rent-free in my head for DAYS now:  

**AliExpress vs Amazon... which one actually makes sense to rely on in 2024?**  

I swear every time I think I‚Äôve got it figured out, I end up going back and forth like a ping pong ball. So maybe you all can help me think through this with clearer eyes.  

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm stuck:  

- **Amazon has speed**. I can literally add something to my cart while making coffee in the morning and it‚Äôll be sitting at my doorstep before I even finish the leftovers in my fridge.  
- **AliExpress has price**. Like‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre talking jaw-dropping, how-do-they-even-survive margins. You can snag items for a FRACTION of what Amazon or even your local store would dare to charge.  
- But the **wait times** on AliExpress??? Good luck. By the time it arrives, you might‚Äôve completely forgotten what you even ordered.  

So then I sit here and wonder:  
Am I paying Amazon for what is essentially glorified convenience? Or am I trusting AliExpress for deals that secretly (probably) challenge my patience and my ability to not cancel the order three times during the wait?  

The contradictions absolutely fry my brain.  

- Do I believe reviews on AliExpress the same way people treat Amazon reviews? (we‚Äôve all seen the ""paid"" reviews thing, yikes).  
- Are products actually *quality identical* if you cut away the branding?  
- Is saving those few dollars worth having zero customer service back-up versus Amazon‚Äôs hassle-free returns?  

It feels like‚Ä¶ do I want my dopamine hit immediately, with Amazon delivering a ‚Äúright here, right now‚Äù lifestyle? Or do I want to lean hard into delayed gratification, betting big on AliExpress and becoming one of those patient-budget-mode saints?  

And THEN there‚Äôs this curveball: Sometimes, browsing AliExpress feels like entering this rabbit hole of *existence itself*. You stumble onto stuff you never even knew humans *needed*, and suddenly you‚Äôre convinced a collapsible cabbage slicer will change the course of your life. On Amazon you just‚Ä¶ go in, grab that one thing, and dip out.  

So I‚Äôm kinda going: convenience vs. curiosity. Reliability vs. randomness. Expensive comfort vs. chaotic surprise.  

It‚Äôs making me rethink what ‚Äúvalue‚Äù even is. Is it money saved? Stress saved? Or perhaps‚Äîtime saved?  

And while I spiral about this, I also stumbled upon this gem‚¨áÔ∏è:  

**Top On Sale Product Recommendations!**

üîó [Click & Buy](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ompIzT7)  

Like‚Ä¶ THIS is the kind of oddly specific, strangely genius thing I find ONLY while scrolling AliExpress. Do I need it right now? Probably not. But do I love that it popped up mid-scroll? Absolutely yes. Amazon never gives me that bizarre discovery thrill.  

So, Reddit: if you had to pick one platform to depend on for the next five years‚Äîare you team AliExpress survival mode, or team Amazon impatience is a virtue?  

Because honestly, I‚Äôm 50/50 torn, and I feel like that awkward line between ‚ÄúI want the deal‚Äù but also ‚ÄúI want my box at my door in under 48 hours.‚Äù

1naz98k,https://i.redd.it/8u4wf7vd2snf1.png,Kyveza ?? Downed - Here's my Advice,"Just downed Ky'veza on my 708 Ret Paladin, about 2/3rds through her fifth global phase (if memory serves) - 8 min, 16 sec (seemed like an eternity, HR felt like 130). I am now 3/3 on ??s this Expac. Ky'veza ?? was definitely easier than Underpin and Zekvir, though by no means ""easy."" Felt like she required more precision with the added mechanic of just having my character pointing the right way six times in rapid succession. My ""everything being a one-shot"" sentiment (saltiness) wasn't totally warranted, because that was also the case for the other bosses' mechanics - all being one-shots - but this felt more unforgiving I think just because it was in more rapid succession, with shorter phases overall (though I could be misremembering). With the down fresh, here's my tips/tricks/encouragement:

* Rotation: As you can see from the screenshot, I bound Single-Button Assist to mousewheel up and mousewheel down and that was it - 100% of the time I was just slowly spinning my mouse wheel (mostly down - towards me). In the beginning, I was trying to do my rotation, but after a while, it wasn't worth the extra DPS to have so many more things to be doing/focusing on. Like others have said - this is not a DPS race, it's just about survival. Your mileage may vary; I'm a very filthy casual.
* Rift/Suck Phase (Nether Rift): So early on I was having a lot of trouble surviving through this. It's short but the four-or-five hits from Ky'veza when I was sucked/pinned in the middle was getting me dangerously close to 10% (which is the same as dying with her as it procs an auto-kill-- why? I'll never know). And just having to worry about my health/self-heal was throwing my rythm off and causing me to miss the first clone in the subsequent Dark Massacre phase. I tried it on Prot Pala for a while, and had zero trouble staying alive, but was just downing her too slow - taking it from 5 phases to 10+. So what ended up eliminating the survivability issue during this phase was for me to plant my portal in the triangle formation--standard--BUT then running out, all the way to the edge of the room before and standing there before the suck. So long as the portals were positioned in a relatively equilateral triangle, once the suck started, I'd get dragged to the middle automatically (just needed to make sure there's no portals bt me and the middle). That quick drag a relatively far distance would cause Kyveza to kind of stand there for a beat and then trundle over, which caused the 5-or-so hits I was having to eat into 3-or-so, which delta made this phase zero problemo. Bonus points if I could grab a pot on the way out to the edge, or, even better, position myself with a pot between me and the middle so I'd drag over it on the way in and get that HOT. Also, once I was in the middle, I'd want to find a potion wherever in the room and be strafing in that direction so when the suck ended I'd be headed over there to top up when the Dark Massacre phase would start. And ofc, I did use a cd or two just cuz - but liked to save the big ones to the end when my heart was pounding.
* Clones Staredown Phase (Dark Massacre): A good bit of luck to just have them spawn relatively in front of you, though my last two were tricky, like, 180, four in view, 180 spawns. I think by the end I was comfortable enough to just turn my camera relatively slowly - even pace, instead of trying to snap-turn every time. The snap-turns were definitely more gratifying, but there were a few slips that I started to avoid by just doig more of a pan turn. Otherwise, keep your gaze relatively soft - let your char stare those fuckers down.
* Clones Daggers/Lines Phase (Nexus Daggers): Definitely the toughest phase. You need to get lucky here to not have two of the clones spawn too close, on either side of me. A lot of tilting in this phase. Barring bad luck, two tricks helped me here. First, once you develop the rythm, you'll kind of know when she's about to do HER daggers - the first set. This is the most dangerous because it's always going to be relatively close to you, so, less spread to step into. The trick is to bait her and step past here - there's a beat between when she's decided where she's going to throw and when her lines appear. During that beat, step past her and now she's throwing in front of herself and you're behind her. After that, and second, read the spreads and take SMALL steps into the gaps. Pro tip: you‚Äôll have a much easier time if you just tap instead of holding ‚Äî I learned that the hard way. You just need to tap 1 second or so in a direction to avoid a spread. Eventually too, I developed the sense for being on a line while another line procs, and then stepping into that newly formed gap after the other lined procced, but, definitely just happened on its own.
* Cups-Game Phase (Invoke the Shadows): Honestly, this one gave me fewer wipes than I thought it would ‚Äî pleasant surprise! I missed it a few times, but this accounted for way less of the wipes than I expected. I just tried to focus on where she was positioned, and counted to 12 in my head. A lot more than not, I was right.
* Brann: Healer spec, Combat Curio: Ethereal Energy Converter; Utility Curio: Audio Amplification Crystal. I had a LOT of trouble with Brann glitching out in the beginning; he would like not move for the Nether Rift phase, so his portal was wherEVER tf he was standing, then he would die, then I would inevitably eventually die because that would instantly tilt me, then we'd all respawn and he'd like sprint as if his life depended on it back into the room and literally pull her. Exit/reenter fixed this, but it was annoying. It pretty much stopped happening after the latest patch, so, maybe the fixed it.

Finally, this fight took a while. I got tilted a bunch of times and stopped progging. When you aren't enjoying it anymore, get up and go do something else. My guild would drag me out of a two-hour void to do a Heroic Manaforged Omega prog and halfway through it, I was like, ""Oh, I still enjoy this game."" That was hella important - my progs on Kyveza ?? were always coming in fresh. First, 75%, then that was the average, then 50%, then 30% two or three times, then I just locked it and, this morning, 1/2-cup of coffee, Chasing Summer by Tiesto and This is What it Feels Like by Armin van Burren, 4th or 5th pull in, downed her. Don‚Äôt get discouraged if the daggers feel impossible at first ‚Äî it really does click with practice/repetition (my pull count in the screenshot says 89 pulls... that was just after I downloaded the tracker;).

1naz93a,https://www.reddit.com/r/KratomKorner/comments/1naz93a/i_am_almost_3_weeks_off_powder_kratom/,I am almost 3 weeks off powder Kratom.,"So the reason I started everyday use was to deal with becoming sober from alcohol and various other substances. Kratom helped me stay off harder drugs for a little over a year now and alcohol 8 months going on 9, 9/29.

The reason I‚Äôve not drank any powder Kratom is because I just can‚Äôt afford it right now and would like other things in my life other than to drink my money. Also to say I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù anything to deal with my deeper issues, whatever they may be I had to and have to keep ripping this band aid off myself. 

I still smoke THC and use wax/dabs and drink coffee/caffeine and nicotine gum/pouches or cigs some weeks. Tried to get back into consistent lifting of weights everyday my body and mental state allows me to. I use to lift everyday till I got a new job then I relapsed in stuff I was clean from 2 and 3 years. Oops.. I‚Äôm happy to survived, again.

So this coming Tuesday will make 3 weeks no Kratom powder and I would take 2 scoops, which would be 3.5g I think or 3g and two of them per drink.. with mio and spring water. I would have these 7g Kratom powder drinks 3-4 times a day in the last 3 months till I quit. Idk what‚Äôs a lot, my body could or use to be able to take a lot of chemicals or substances, so I kinda feel an oz of Kratom is too much..

The first week wasn‚Äôt fun, shit sleep, no energy, dragging my feet, yawning, flu like symptoms, no energy and depression and anxiety. I just tried to work and come home, eat then sleep repeat.

It took till week 1.5 almost 2 weeks for the flu stuff to shake off. I‚Äôve kicked H and M before, it‚Äôs fine. 

The worst part was the trying to sleep. Just irritable and restless body and my arms and back couldn‚Äôt keep still. That faded after week one though.

I can say please watch your intake before you‚Äôre taking more than you need and just getting a buzz to deal with whatever substance you replaced kratom with or whatever and however you use it, it will help ppl, it probably saves lives. It helped me tremendously, I‚Äôm just saying please watch yourself and keep track of how much you‚Äôre taking in for sure cause it gets slippery kinda quick it seems over 8 months even.

It‚Äôs not much but I love it. Six months after I moved in, my sister ‚ÄúDiana‚Äù fell on hard times and she and her triplets moved in until she can get back on her feet. As an adult, she developed real difficulty sleeping, so much so that I gave her the primary bedroom. I installed black out curtains, special light bulbs and bought an expensive sound machine, all to try to help her out. Her sleep issues are so bad, she can‚Äôt even hold down a job and must spend hours during the day catching up on her sleep. Of course the triplets need a room of their own, so I‚Äôve been sleeping on the couch. Fast forward to today, the kiddos are 2 now and their toys and paraphernalia are everywhere. Sometimes I end up sleeping under the coffee table because even the couch is covered with toddler stuff. 

Here‚Äôs where I may be the assh√∂le: I recently approached my sister about sharing the primary bedroom. I offered to put a small pallet on the floor that I could roll up during the day. I could Army crawl across the floor to the pallet after I get the triplets down, trying not to disturb her. Of course with her sleep difficulties, this is a huge ask and she told me absolutely no, I‚Äôm selfish to even ask. How would I get up for work without waking her? How would I respond in the night to the triplets without waking her? Why don‚Äôt I put my pallet underneath one of the cribs in the other room? Didn‚Äôt that even occur to me? Is that not ‚Äúfancy‚Äù enough for me? All legitimate questions that I hadn‚Äôt even thought of. 

Now family is blowing up my phone asking me why I want to destroy her health? Why I can‚Äôt use the little brains the good lord gave me? Why is ‚ÄúI‚Äù the only letter in ‚Äúfamily‚Äù that I care about?

Don‚Äôt sugar coat it: Did I cross a line putting my needs over Diana‚Äôs health concerns?",6,1757266075.0,AmITheAngel,15,0.88,False

**WARNING: SPOILERS!!!!!**





\- It's great. Much better than I had anticipated to be honest, but then again as a long time Burton fan, he rarely disappoints.

HOWEVER.

\- The season is way too short. A season cut into two parts of only four episodes is diabolical. Even with the strike, we waited so long for this and it was over WAY too fast.

\- Too much happening in episode one and two, which left me feeling the season peaked at episode 3 and slowly went downhill toward the season's end. Don't get me wrong, I loved all episodes but with SO much happening in the beginning and having to cram all the plot twists and turns in 8 episodes, I feel like the beginning was an exposion of things happening and episodes 4-8 were hastily trying to tie everything together.

\- A few props and shots were just weird. I understand that it's fantasy and supposed to look absurd, but the frappucino that 'Wednesday' buys at the coffee booth is SO fake/styrofoamy and then the next shot she drank it all. Also I've seen more than one shot where you would see someone from behind talking and their face doesn't move at all. Feels amateuristic honestly and not something I'm used to from insane budget series and movies.

\- Lady Gaga's part felt totally unnecessary and forced. I like that she was in the series, it was a nice surprise, but like.. why? It was such a short cameo but it was shown as being almost a highlight of the entire series. It wasn't. If they make such an entrance, she should have had a bigger part.

\- I don't really like how they wrote off Bruno as a cheating boyfriend. I can't really explain why, but it all felt super rushed and again, unnecessary.

  
That's it so far, I want to watch the entire series again soon but this is my two cents :) What did you all think of season two? What were your favorite bits and are there also things that disappointed you?",4,1757265946.0,Wednesday,0,0.83,False

Attitude wise as well, I find that you're way more upbeat and friendly which is a nice change of pace. I've had my co-workers bring me coffee or snacks for no reason other than to be nice, and any time someone invites me out for after work drinks or an activity its almost always the Gen-Zs.

1naz156,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1naz156,My Hyderabad Chronicles: Fast Food Frenzy - Fattened Up Waistline (3/n),"As part of my Hyderabad Chronicles, here‚Äôs my 3rd article (3/n) - this time on everyone‚Äôs favourite one: Fast Food

You can‚Äôt walk two steps in Hyderabad without spotting a tea shop, a tiffin centre, a biryani house, or a curry point. 

The city is exploding with eateries and street food shops - from roadside stalls to glossy chains - all serving the same fat-heavy, carb-loaded, grease-dripping food.

What‚Äôs surprising is not the lack of healthy choices - but how people actively ignore them. 

The lines are always for fried snacks, sugary desserts and spice-packed meals. 

Chocolate ice creams, sugar-soaked cakes, and oversized milkshakes have become the new addiction - pouring in calories nobody really needs. Imagine the extra sugar that would impact the heath of teenagers?!

The irony? The only slim and fit folks are the ones behind the counter - working day and night to serve the crowds.

The combination of sugar, salt and spice is dangerously addictive (duh!). Whether through ignorance or lack of education , most don‚Äôt seem to care. 

Plates here aren‚Äôt small either - rice piled high, curries swimming in oil, syrup spilling out of sweets and scoops of ice cream stacked endlessly. And double sugar filled Chai-Coffees or chocolate based milkshakes, soft drinks are a norm with the food - why?? It beats me!

And then, of course, there‚Äôs the biryani obsession. 


Hyderabadis love their biryani so much that it‚Äôs almost a religion. 

But think about it: mostly rice, a couple of pieces of meat and a caloric load that makes it anything but ideal for regular eating. 

I don‚Äôt want to make assumptions on the quality of the ingredients that go inside these dishes - and hygiene! 

The newer ‚ÄúMandi‚Äù style biryani trend has only amplified the craze, with huge platters shared in groups.

Another irony? 

Just like eateries, a long list of hospitals now stand at almost every corner. And here‚Äôs the kicker - one of the most famous hospitals in town, known for its gastrointestinal and gut health treatments, has a restaurant inside that hardly serves anything ‚Äúhealthy.‚Äù I doubt it‚Äôs the hospital management deciding this; more likely it‚Äôs people‚Äôs habits dictating the menu.

I still remember when fast food in Hyderabad meant a simple Irani chai and a couple of Osmania biscuits. 

Back then, chai shops ran round the clock, but samosas, burgers and pizzas weren‚Äôt flooding every street corner. 

Times have changed - the city‚Äôs waistline shows it.

So here‚Äôs my question to you all: Is Hyderabad‚Äôs love affair with biryani, chai, and sugar-laden fast food just part of its cultural charm - or are we sleepwalking into a serious health crisis?",3,1757265605.0,hyderabad,0,1.0,False

1naz03f,https://www.reddit.com/r/movareader/comments/1naz03f/movareader_vs_readlang_an_honest_comparison/,MovaReader vs. Readlang: An Honest Comparison,"When it comes to **learning a new language through reading**, two tools stand out: **MovaReader** and **Readlang**. Both platforms help learners strengthen vocabulary and comprehension while engaging with authentic texts. However, they approach language learning differently, making each tool suitable for distinct learning needs.

This article provides a **comprehensive, unbiased comparison** between MovaReader and Readlang, so you can decide which one fits your goals best.

# What Is MovaReader?

**MovaReader** is a relatively new language-learning service that focuses on **reading your own texts**. Unlike many platforms that limit you to preloaded lessons, MovaReader allows you to:

* **Upload your own materials** ‚Äì from ebooks in `.txt` format to personal documents.
* **Import subtitles** ‚Äì for example, from Netflix or YouTube (Spanish, English, Ukrainian, etc.) to study while later rewatching the original video.
* **Access public-domain works** ‚Äì classic books and articles available to everyone.
* **Generate custom articles with AI** ‚Äì on any topic of interest, either privately or for public use.

What sets MovaReader apart is its **data-driven learning dashboard**. At the beginning of each book or article, users can instantly see:

* Percentage of the text they already understand.
* Number of unique words they know.
* Words currently being studied.
* Words that still need to be learned for full comprehension.

Each word in the text is clickable, showing an **AI-generated translation** with **example sentences**. If a sentence remains unclear, learners can translate the **entire sentence** for additional context, with AI providing higher-quality translations than traditional machine translation tools.

Additional features include:

* Listening to text read aloud.
* Bookmarking articles or marking them as ‚Äúlearned.‚Äù
* 500 free translations for new users.
* Subscription cost: **‚Ç¨5/month** (about the price of a cup of coffee in some cities).

Currently, MovaReader supports **English, Spanish, and Ukrainian**, with more languages to come.

# What Is Readlang?

**Readlang** is one of the more established tools in the digital language-learning landscape. It gained popularity for its **simplicity and practicality**, especially among learners who prefer real-world texts over gamified apps.

Key features of Readlang include:

* Reading **any text** with instant word and phrase translations.
* A **web reader extension** that allows learners to translate directly on websites.
* Automatic flashcard creation from translated words and phrases.
* Support for **over 50 languages**, making it one of the most versatile platforms available.
* A community library with shared texts from other users.

Readlang‚Äôs biggest strength lies in its **breadth of supported languages** and its **seamless integration into web browsing**. However, it lacks advanced AI-powered features, detailed comprehension analytics, or deep customization of personal texts compared to MovaReader.

# Head-to-Head: MovaReader vs. Readlang

Here‚Äôs how the two platforms compare:

|Feature|**MovaReader**|**Readlang**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Supported languages**|English, Spanish, Ukrainian (more planned)|50+ languages|
|**Custom text upload**|Yes ‚Äì ebooks (.txt), personal documents, subtitles|Yes ‚Äì text and web integration|
|**AI-generated content**|Yes ‚Äì articles on any topic|No|
|**Translation type**|AI-powered word + sentence translation with examples|Word/phrase translation|
|**Comprehension tracking**|Unique dashboard: % of understanding, words known, words to learn|Flashcards and review, but no detailed analytics|
|**Audio support**|Yes ‚Äì listen to text|Limited|
|**Pricing**|‚Ç¨5/month (500 free translations for new users)|Free version + Premium plan ($5/month)|
|**Focus**|Deep reading comprehension with personal/custom texts|Wide language coverage + web integration|

# Which Tool Should You Choose?

* **Choose MovaReader if‚Ä¶**
   * You want to learn by reading **your own books, articles, or subtitles**.
   * You value **AI support** for sentence-level translations and context-rich examples.
   * You like having **clear statistics** on what you understand and what you still need to learn.
   * Your main focus is **English, Spanish, or Ukrainian**.
* **Choose Readlang if‚Ä¶**
   * You are learning a language **other than English, Spanish, or Ukrainian**.
   * You prefer reading directly on the web with an **easy-to-use browser extension**.
   * You want access to a **community library** with shared texts.
   * You like the idea of **flashcards automatically generated** from your translations.

# Final Verdict

Both **MovaReader** and **Readlang** are excellent tools, but they serve different learning styles:

* **MovaReader** is best for learners who want a **personalized, AI-enhanced reading experience** with clear progress tracking.
* **Readlang** is best for learners who want a **broad language selection** and quick, practical integration with everyday web reading.

In the end, the choice comes down to your **target language** and your **preferred learning approach**. If your focus is **deep comprehension of personal texts**, MovaReader offers innovative tools that go beyond traditional translation. If your goal is **versatility across many languages** and simplicity, Readlang remains a solid choice.

2. (Optional) Add an amount if you want to request a specific payment‚Äîsay 0.005 BTC for that custom 3D-printed lightsaber you‚Äôre selling.
3. Hit generate.
4. Instantly, you‚Äôve got a neat QR code that anyone can scan with their Bitcoin wallet app.

That‚Äôs it. No downloads, no registrations, no shady middlemen asking for your private keys (seriously, never share those). Just pure, open-source crypto convenience.

# Fun Uses You Didn‚Äôt Think Of

Sure, QR codes make accepting Bitcoin simple, but why stop there? Here are some creative ways people are already using our free app:

* **Merchants & shops**: Print your QR code and tape it near your cash register. Instant Bitcoin POS system‚Äîno clunky hardware required.

* **Everyday fun**: Put your Bitcoin QR code on a T-shirt, business card, or even your holiday greeting cards. ‚ÄúMerry Christmas, here‚Äôs my wallet address!‚Äù

Basically, if it can be printed or displayed, your QR code can live there.

# The Future of Effortless Payments

Let‚Äôs have a little heart-to-heart about being a creator in today‚Äôs fast-paced digital world. If you're a beginner, the sheer number of AI tools out there can feel like stepping into a candy store‚Äîexciting but overwhelming, right? But here's the scoop‚Äîwe've got to be strategic about this before the gold rush ends!

**You‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWhy should I care?‚Äù** Well, because your hard-earned money shouldn‚Äôt be going down the drain when there are smarter ways to create content! Here‚Äôs a little guide to help you maximize your AI tools and avoid the dreaded cash burn. 

**1. Identify Your Needs:**  
   - What are you creating? Blogs, videos, social media posts?  
   - **Focus on your goals:** Branding? Engagement? Driving sales? Know why you‚Äôre using these tools!

**2. Pick Your Tool Wisely:**  
   - With so many options, choose a couple of tools that align with your goals.  
   - **Popular Picks:** 
      - **ChatGPT** for brainstorming and writing assistance.  
      - **Canva** for quick graphic design.  
      - **Jasper** for SEO-friendly content creation.  

**3. Start Small and Scale:**  
   - Don‚Äôt subscribe to every tool on day one.  
   - **$10 a month here, $30 a month there,** and you‚Äôre looking at a pricey habit! Start with the free trials‚Äîthey‚Äôre out there for a reason!

**4. Learn, Don‚Äôt Just Use:**  
   - Invest time in learning how to use these tools effectively. **YouTube tutorials, online communities** like *AiContentAutomators*, and webinars can be goldmines!  
   - Knowledge is power, or should we say, *money saved*?

**5. Experiment!**  
   - Don‚Äôt be afraid to try different tools and methodologies.  
   - Think about it: If you don‚Äôt experiment, how will you know what works best for you? 

**But Wait, There‚Äôs More! üí°**  
Are you capturing data and learning from your outputs? It‚Äôs all about that feedback loop! If one headline gets more views, what can you turn it into next? Bonus‚Äîkeep track of your expenses. Trust me; it'll make you feel like a financial wizard.

**And hey, here‚Äôs a little humor to lighten the mood:** If I had a dollar for every time I signed up for a tool I didn‚Äôt end up using, I could probably buy a small island. Or at least a nice coffee! ‚òï‚ú®

At the end of the day, it‚Äôs about **working smarter, not harder**. Don‚Äôt let shiny tools distract you from your goals. **Before the gold rush ends, make sure you‚Äôve got your pickaxe and a plan!** Just like any adventure, it‚Äôs about striking the right balance between exploration and efficiency.

Every day with this coffee maker begins with a quick process that leaves my cup filled with rich, aromatic coffee. It's designed for simplicity and performance, and having used it daily, I've grown to appreciate both its strengths and little quirks. Whether rushing to a meeting or savoring a relaxed morning brew, this machine promises convenience and versatility. Let me take you through my experience.

**Sleek Modern Design and Compact Build**  
The first thing you notice about this brewer is its contemporary look. With a glossy finish and an understated modern style, it holds its place proudly on any countertop. Despite its elegance, the machine is surprisingly compact, fitting comfortably in tighter spaces and leaving room for other appliances. Several coworkers who visited me at home specifically commented on how well this device blended aesthetics with function. The mint color stands out uniquely‚Äîperfect for anyone looking to add a subtle touch of personality to their kitchen.

**Performance that Simplifies Coffee Brewing**  
As someone who needs that first cup of coffee to kick-start their day, reliability is vital, and this coffee maker doesn‚Äôt disappoint. It provides the option for three brew sizes: 8, 10, or 12 ounces. The fact that it brews coffee in minutes is a huge bonus, especially during the workweek when every second counts. An exciting feature I‚Äôve loved playing with is the 'strong' button. If you prefer your coffee bold and intense like I do during my mid-week slumps, this feature offers a noticeable strength boost to your brew.

**Check [Keurig 5000377904] price on Amazon.**  

**42oz Water Reservoir: A Thoughtful Convenience**  
This removable water reservoir is designed with practicality in mind. It holds enough water to brew up to four cups (if you‚Äôre using an 8oz cup). This additional storage means I don‚Äôt constantly need to refill between uses. With back-to-back brewing capabilities, prepping a second cup just after the first is ridiculously fast. Hosting guests becomes manageable since the device doesn‚Äôt require heating downtime between cycles.

**Versatility in Coffee Options**  
From traditional coffee pods to reusable K-Cup filters for my fresh-ground beans, this brewer ensures I‚Äôm not restricted in my coffee choices. A few friends who are more into teas than coffee had a great time experimenting with tea K-Cup pods during game night. For someone like me who occasionally enjoys hot cocoa or specialty flavors, this versatility is a huge win.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact size with an aesthetic appeal that fits any d√©cor.  
- 'Strong' button for users craving a bold coffee experience.  
- Back-to-back brewing saves time during busy mornings.  

**Critiques**  
- The drip tray often requires frequent cleaning, especially if using taller travel mugs.  
- Cup size options don‚Äôt always feel tailored to smaller servings.  

**Ease of Maintenance and User Experience**  
Cleaning and maintaining this machine have been fairly straightforward. The removable drip tray and reservoir make rinsing out leftover coffee or grime a breeze. However, I have to admit that the drip tray‚Äôs tendency to collect excess coffee can be a little frustrating when I‚Äôm in a hurry. It's not a dealbreaker, but you‚Äôll want to keep a napkin nearby for quick cleanups.

**Travel Mug Compatibility**  
Another feature worth pointing out is how travel mugs fit snugly once the drip tray is removed. I've tested it with my 7-inch stainless steel thermos, and it worked perfectly. This practical touch is especially appreciated during busy mornings when I‚Äôm rushing to the car or hopping onto the subway.

**Product Contenders**  
The competitive world of single-serve coffee makers offers many alternatives, such as the Nespresso Essenza Mini or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. While both competitors have impressive features, especially in pod variety and pricing, this Keurig model still holds its ground with adaptability, ease of use, and its standout ‚Äòstrong‚Äô brew option. That said, the Nespresso offers a slightly richer crema, appealing to espresso die-hards, while the Hamilton Beach leans into affordability, especially for households with varying coffee preferences. If you're after an aesthetically pleasing, compact, and versatile brewer, however, this product shines bright.

**Price Performance**  
For its price range, this coffee maker offers excellent features without cutting corners on build quality or usability. The brand delivers dependable performance, and the additional details, like the strong brew functionality and removable reservoir, give more value than some of its pricier counterparts. If you're considering affordability and functionality, this option balances the two brilliantly.

This follows the recent closures of both the Wells Fargo Bank and Scolari‚Äôs in Sun Valley.

The letter to the Board of County Commissioners signed by chair Heidi Soper mentions in bold that the community is facing daily hardships and mobility impact.

It seeks help to ‚Äúproactively notify institutions of this opportunity and provide information on the customer base to encourage reestablishing services,‚Äù  and elevating awareness to highlight the service gap.

Finally the last bullet point is labeled funding, to ‚Äúexplore community development block grant funds or other incentives to attract community banking partners, while raising awareness that this represents a clear business opportunity.‚Äù

The letter concludes that ‚Äúthe loss of banking and grocery establishments is not just an inconvenience but also a significant blow to the community‚Äôs accessibility and economic vitality.‚Äù

It urges the county‚Äôs increased involvement to improve the quality of life for Sun Valley residents. Estimates of its population are at over 22-thousand people.

The closest supermarket is now the WinCo on Northtowne Lane three miles away, with a Wells Fargo nearby.

I went into this movie thinking it would be about a coffee table that had some evil forces trapped within it. In the first ten minutes or so, you really don‚Äôt know where the movie is headed, and I loved that. Then, when *it* happened, my jaw dropped. I could not face the fact that >!the baby was dead!<. Then the dinner with his brother was just sickening. I am so glad I never had the opportunity to see this in theaters because I stopped the movie *SEVERAL* times to look at photos and videos of my kids. I used to be able to handle anything in horror, but this was dark as fuck, and being a parent has made me a complete softie. Even so, I‚Äôm glad I watched it. 

Now, a few criticisms. While this was a very unique idea, and *that* scene reminded me a lot of *the* scene from Hereditary, which was wildly effective, there were so many things these guys did that first time parents would never do, especially not a control freak like the wife in this movie. A glass coffee table with sharp edges and floating glass, unbreakable or not, is a hard no for any parent, and yet the wife never mentions this in her arguments against getting the table. That should have been the first and winning argument. Also, a newborn like this one never would have slept for that long without feeding. They had a full blown dinner and never once checked on him or the monitor or anything? That‚Äôs ridiculous. They probably should‚Äôve made the mom a little less of a control freak who wasn‚Äôt breastfeeding to make it believable for parents. I do understand, though, that if I weren‚Äôt a parent, this would all be seriously believable and horrific.

There is a lot to why I‚Äôm feeling like this that I don‚Äôt want to bother you all with but here are the cliff notes.

I‚Äôm about a 3 hour flight from home and my flight doesn‚Äôt leave until tomorrow morning.

My fianc√© and I called off our engagement about a year ago and she immediately started talking to somebody else. I did a lot of bad in our relationship as well as her so it‚Äôs not a blame her for everything type of situation. I moved upstairs into a new unit so even though we were broken up we lived on top of each other. After a few months went by we ended up getting back together. It was a pretty rocky road.

My ex fiance and I had ups and downs and kind of broke up again about a month ago but would hang out, get coffee, watch movies, fool around together.

I found out a few weeks ago she went on a date with someone.

 There is a girl that I had a bit crush on from when I was younger and we stayed in touch through social media throughout the years. We grew closer throughout my breakups and she is currently going through a separation herself. We decided to meet up on a trip together and get an Airbnb. It‚Äôs been nice but I have this overwhelming sense of guilt about the whole thing. I miss my ex a lot. This girl is very much into me and that just adds to my guilt.

All I want to do is go back home and tell my ex that I love her and I want to find a way to make things work.

On top of that I have overwhelming health anxiety and air travel adds to that. I didn‚Äôt sleep much either so feeling a bit broken down. I had Bell‚Äôs palsy a year and a half ago and although I recovered I‚Äôve always been scared of getting it again and when I get broken down like this my anxiety about it goes through the roof.

All I want to do is jump in a car and go home right now. I would prefer the 10 hour drive to waiting on this flight tomorrow honestly. I‚Äôm having so much trouble making it through this day.

I have to TLDR briefly before u get mad: While my words are sincere and harsh, it still ends pretty well for you. You should finish reading before making an idea on my thoughts.  
  
First of all, let me clarify my position on Wednesday romanticism.   
I don't think I've ever found someone sharing my precise point of view on the situation.  
I'm shipless. I want Wednesday to have a mate. I think none of the male interests so far satisfy the requirements for her.   
I'll be short: Wed's fatal flaw ( = narratology concept that sits **at the pinnacle** of all requirements for a good story ) is being prideful to extreme levels. She constantly endagers and damages all people nearby to gain even the most minuscule advantage to her life. She thinks she's better than anyone at anything, ecc.  
The way you solve this is to make her fall, over and over, until she breaks for good and changes.  
Tyler's fatal flaw is not being in control of his own life, and he finally understood in 2x08 that's he's being bossed around by random women for the past year.   
  
If they got together with Wednesday right now, **as of things are currently**, it'd be absolute garbage:  
  
She'd become her master, and:  
\- He'd still be controlled  
\- She'd still be the same person, except she now has a pet she sometimes kisses so that babies watching can blush. 

Now you have to decide for yourself: Are you one of these kinds of shippers, that have no concept of what good narrative is, and just want to see them kiss and cuddle while scrolling tiktok, never asking yourself questions about what's happening in the show? 

Or you are someone that grown fond of tyler's simplicity and honesty in the first episodes, and are now willing to wait?

If you are willing to wait, I have good news: Please rewatch the show, this timey you don't have to bite and eat your nails waiting if they are gonna  kiss or he's gonna die. Cause you already know the story.  
You will be able to see the following things:

1) Wednesday gets ragebaited by him on their first meet, then tries to hurt him saying stuff she clearly doesn't think: He's got average looks, sub-par barista skills and whatnot. She thinks none of that as she kised him and asked him coffee several times through s1. 

2) Weems says she still has feelings for Tyler. She answers back that she hates him. But that's just her being dodgy and Weems instantly dismissed it: "" You're endangering you and your friends just to try control him "".  To hate someone is to wish for their death: She'd kill him. And she could have done that really easily by blitzing and cheesing with her friend's powers:  
a) Siren song him into cutting his own throat  
b) Gorgone  stone him, then break the stone  
c) Have enid's wolf pack hunt him down ( and sorry for saying this, but even tho he would have 100% killed enid in 1v1 in 1x08, the fight was shown to be close enough that even just 2 wolves would absolutely body the shit out of him ). 

3) Tyler threw her out of the window and sent her through a coma, then watched as she'd get buried alive, despite that she does NOT go for the kill in the last episode. Do you realize how big this is? Idk if you do. Wednesday's extremely prideful. There's 0 shot she doesn't kill him if he's a random to her. 

4) Bonus point: This season, I can count at least 3 solid examples that Enid is STRAIGHT:  
a) Love triangle with BOYS  
b) Agnes calls her BOY-crazy ( in 2x06 )  
c) Agnes gives her a list of potential BOY-friends (  2x07 or 2x08 )  
There's zero shot they get together. Before getting together, they'd have to play a super-sensed storyline that transitions both characters from straight to bi. CAN it happen? It's plausible. But the likelihood of it is insignificant. 

CONCLUSIONS:  
The fact a fight with other ships even exists goes to show that you are insecure about it. If you were to look at it logically, you'd be so safe-locked there would be no discussion about it. You'd look at other shippers as adults look to children: They talk to them, but it's all toying around. 

Let other people ship whoever they want. This is not an attempt to radicalize you either. This is just me looking at facts.

# In-person:

* Good for meeting people (I made a few friends that way)
* Felt more immersive when I was totally new and could attend full-time
* More social - we‚Äôd go for coffee or hang out after class sometimes

But it was hard to stay consistent. I missed classes due to interviews and appointments, and sometimes the pace felt too slow or too fast depending on the group.

# Online:

* More flexibility. Once I started working this was so much handier than travelling to class
* Easier to stick to a regular schedule
* More speaking time, classes are much smaller (usually 3-4 in group classes)

Both have their pros. In-person was nice for community and getting a good foundation in German, but online worked better for structure and long-term consistency (I'm up to B1 now) especially now that I‚Äôm working full-time.

1naylop,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1naylop/reveal_the_truth_behind_cascade_platinum_plus/,Reveal the Truth Behind Cascade Platinum Plus Dishwasher Pods,"The Cascade Platinum Plus, model B0DPLMRV33, had been on my radar for a while. As someone who relies heavily on a dishwasher due to my busy schedule and disdain for handwashing, I was eager to see how this dishwasher detergent stacked up. After daily use for weeks, I feel like I've gained enough insight to break down the good, the bad, and the curious aspects of this product.

**Impressive Cleaning Performance**  
Nothing frustrates me more than opening the dishwasher only to find crusty remnants of last night‚Äôs lasagna clinging stubbornly to plates. This dishwasher detergent delivered impressive cleaning results, removing not just visible debris but also invisible food residues. Even dishes with dried-on bits were gleaming by the end of the wash cycle. The 2X grease-fighting power, boosted by Dawn's expertise, showed its worth. I‚Äôm talking about plates that could almost be used as mirrors, though I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. 

[Check Cascade Platinum Plus B0DPLMRV33 price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b0dplmrv33/)  

**Ease of Use and Compatibility**  
The 40% larger liquid top was a thoughtful touch. It easily fit into the detergent dispenser of my mid-range dishwasher, and it didn‚Äôt feel like I needed to cram it in. I‚Äôve tried other pods that just felt bulky or finicky, but this one slid right into place with no drama. I appreciated that it worked effectively even on shorter dishwasher cycles, something particularly useful for my midday loads consisting mostly of coffee cups and cereal bowls.  

**Good Aspects**  
‚Ä¢ Exceptional cleaning for removing visible and invisible residues  
‚Ä¢ Breaks down tough grease and dried-on food  
‚Ä¢ Convenient pod format that fits easily into dispensers  

**Residue Free and Shine Factor**  
Beyond the thorough cleaning, there was something oddly satisfying about the spot-free, shiny dishes this product left behind. Glassware emerged pristine, with no haze or streaks to speak of, which has been an issue with cheaper detergents I‚Äôve tried in the past. I‚Äôve hosted guests who genuinely commented on the sparkle‚Äîyes, sparkle‚Äîof my wine glasses. Definitely a silent win for someone who takes pride in their dinner table aesthetics.  

**Shortcomings**  
‚Ä¢ The pods have a strong, slightly overwhelming fresh scent that lingers  
‚Ä¢ Price per pod is higher compared to lower-tier detergents  
‚Ä¢ Not ideal for those with strict scent sensitivities  

**Water and Efficiency Conscious**  
What surprised me most was the claim about water conservation when using the dishwasher daily. I did a little digging, and it turns out that ENERGY STAR-certified dishwashers paired with these pods can save up to 20 gallons of water per use compared to handwashing. That‚Äôs a pretty compelling statistic for someone looking to minimize household utility costs while doing their bit for the environment.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to popular brands like Finish Quantum, Cascade Platinum Plus stands out in grease-fighting performance. Finish tends to struggle a bit more with baked-on food, and the spot-free finish isn‚Äôt as reliable. However, Finish Quantum does come at a slightly more affordable price point, which might make it an attractive option for budget shoppers. On the flip side, many off-brand options cannot compete with the scrubbing power or grease removal offered by this pod. If you need that ""scrape-free-before-loading"" kind of detergent, this one wins against most competitors.  

**Price Performance**  
The price point is undoubtedly higher than your average detergent, but the overall value it provides offsets this. In my eyes, its cleaning efficiency and ability to save water make it a worthy investment. Rather than going through multiple cycles or using additional products like pre-wash liquids, these pods manage to consolidate the entire cleaning process into one step. The slight extra cost is, ironically, where it feels like a smart financial move.

1) You can heal in the air, not just on the ground like regular Hollow Knight. If you're fighting an enemy that only uses ground attacks, utilize the heck outta this.
2) Later on in the game you can get an item called the >!warding bell!< , this item >!shields you from damage while healing if you apply it to your crest!< but what they don't tell you about this item, is that >!if you're interrupted by damage, you don't heal and your shield breaks.!< Seems like a great item at first, but isn't super useful beyond a few mini bosses.
3) Utilize the everloving heck outra the >!Magnetite Brooch. It collects rosaries so you don't have to chase them down.!<
4) Even if you have 0 silk when you die, when you claim your cocoon, you get full silk. Utilize this if you died in a boss fight to get an extra heal in an emergency. 
5) Look for fleas everywhere! >!If you find all 5 fleas before Greymoor, then talk to the fleamaster, you can avoid a pretty difficult boss fight, and get streamlined all the way to Bellhart/Shellwood!<
6) If you find yourself dying a lot, there's an item called >!Dead bug's purse!< that saves some of your rosaries. Very useful if you have a ton of rosaries on death.
7) You can >!change your entire moveset by collecting new crests. If you get the Reaper's crest from Greymoor you get the downward slash instead of the angled one. You can also get the wanderer's crest from Wormways later on to get a downward slash, and a moveset that's just like base HK!<
8) Do every quest relatively soon because you might be like me, and forget exactly who you accepted them from, and in which area, and it may screw you over. I've got 3 quests that I have no recollection of where I accepted them from lol
9) Don't forget to have fun! The second you start getting overwhelmed about deaths, the game starts to feel less fun. Take a break, have a coffee, eat a sandwich, then come back. Clear your head, clear the game.",1,1757264400.0,HollowKnight,0,1.0,False

Choosing the right tool is a crucial step in language learning, especially when your primary method is immersion through reading. Both **MovaReader** and **LingQ** are powerful platforms that allow you to learn a language by interacting with authentic text. However, they approach this task with different philosophies and feature sets. This detailed comparison will help you understand their core differences, strengths, and weaknesses to decide which one is the best fit for your learning style.

# At a Glance: Key Differences

While both platforms are built around the concept of extensive reading, their approach to content, technology, and user experience sets them apart. Here's a quick overview of their main distinctions:

* **Content Focus:** MovaReader emphasizes user-uploaded and AI-generated content, while LingQ focuses on a vast, community-curated library.
* **Technology:** MovaReader leverages modern AI for more nuanced translations and example sentences. LingQ‚Äôs core technology is its ""LingQ"" system for tracking known words.
* **Pricing:** MovaReader offers a more affordable, straightforward subscription model. LingQ has a tiered pricing structure that is generally more expensive.
* **Interface:** MovaReader's design is simple and highly focused on key progress metrics. LingQ has a more feature-rich, and sometimes more complex, interface.

# Core Features and Methodology

# MovaReader's Approach

MovaReader is a relatively new player in the market, built with a clear mission: to make reading your own content a seamless language learning experience. Its key strength lies in its ability to process custom texts. You can privately upload any `.txt` file‚Äîfrom a personal article to an entire book‚Äîor even import subtitles from Netflix or YouTube. This feature alone provides unparalleled control over your learning material, ensuring you are always engaged with content you genuinely find interesting.

A standout feature is the **progress panel** at the beginning of each text. It provides a unique and motivating snapshot of your learning journey:

* **Comprehension Percentage:** Shows how much of the text you already understand.
* **Known Unique Words:** A count of the unique words you already know in the text.
* **Words to Learn:** The number of new words you need to study from the text.
* **Remaining Unique Words:** The total number of unique words you still need to process to fully understand the material.

The platform's use of AI is a game-changer. When you click on a word, you receive an **AI-generated translation** complete with contextual example sentences, offering a deeper understanding than traditional dictionaries. If a full sentence is confusing, you can also use the AI to translate it with higher accuracy than older translation tools. The service also includes a text-to-speech function so you can listen to the content.

# LingQ's Approach

LingQ has been a staple in the language learning community for many years, famous for its vast library of lessons and its unique ""LingQ"" system. When you read a lesson on LingQ, you tap on new words to create a ""LingQ,"" which essentially flags the word for review and adds it to your vocabulary list. This system is designed to track exactly which words you have encountered and are in the process of learning.

LingQ's content library is extensive, featuring thousands of lessons contributed by the community, as well as professionally curated content. The platform's methodology centers on the idea of building a massive vocabulary by repeatedly encountering words in different contexts.

# Content and Customization

# MovaReader's Content

MovaReader's content strategy is highly user-centric. You are not limited to a pre-defined library. The ability to import private texts, books, or subtitles means you can learn from any source you like. This is particularly valuable for learners who have a specific book they want to read, or who want to improve their comprehension of a particular TV show or movie. Additionally, you can generate new articles on any topic using the platform‚Äôs AI, ensuring a constant stream of fresh, relevant content tailored to your interests.

# LingQ's Content

LingQ‚Äôs strength lies in its immense and varied library. From news articles to podcasts and full books, the LingQ community has contributed a staggering amount of content across dozens of languages. This makes it an excellent choice for learners who prefer to have a ready-made source of material and don't want the hassle of finding or importing their own.

# User Experience and Interface

MovaReader's user experience is designed for simplicity and focus. The interface is clean, with the main progress panel serving as a constant motivator. There are no distracting ads or cluttered buttons, allowing you to concentrate solely on the text and your vocabulary. The core functions‚Äîtranslating words and sentences‚Äîare powered by AI, which makes the process more intuitive and effective.

LingQ's interface is feature-rich, which can be both a blessing and a curse. While it offers a wide range of tools for managing vocabulary, tracking stats, and interacting with the community, new users might find it a bit overwhelming. The main learning curve comes from understanding how to efficiently use the ""LingQ"" system and navigate the various features.

# Pricing and Accessibility

This is a significant point of comparison. MovaReader provides 500 free translations to start, allowing you to test the service without any commitment. The monthly subscription is a flat 5 EUR, which is a very competitive price, often compared to the cost of a single cup of coffee. This straightforward and affordable model makes it highly accessible.

LingQ has a free version with limitations on the number of LingQs you can create and lessons you can import. The paid subscriptions are more expensive and come in different tiers, offering a range of benefits from unlimited LingQs to additional features. For dedicated learners, the cost can add up, making it a larger financial commitment.

# The Verdict: Which One Is Right for You?

Both MovaReader and LingQ are excellent tools that facilitate learning through reading. However, your ideal choice depends entirely on your learning preferences.

**Choose MovaReader if:**

* You want to learn from **your own content** like books or subtitles.
* You value a **simple, intuitive interface** that focuses on core reading tasks.
* You need powerful, **AI-driven translation** and sentence examples.
* You're looking for a **highly affordable** and straightforward subscription.
* You are learning one of the currently supported languages: **English, Spanish, or Ukrainian**.

**Choose LingQ if:**

* You want access to a **massive, pre-existing library** and don't want to find your own content.
* You thrive in a **community-based learning environment**.
* You prefer a **feature-rich platform** with a comprehensive system for vocabulary tracking.
* You are willing to invest more for a broader range of features and content.

Ultimately, MovaReader and LingQ represent two different philosophies of language learning. MovaReader provides a streamlined, AI-powered toolkit for a highly personalized and affordable experience, while LingQ offers a vast, community-driven ecosystem. The best tool is the one that aligns with your specific learning needs.

I have cutt off all but one friend who lives abroad, because rest have thrown negativity on preparing for government exams. I have even removed instagram and facebook and never look at it because of negativity and distraction.

Whenever I need some human contact, I talk to my one friend who is abroad, or cousin who is also preparing. I also go out on my own to shop or have coffee whenever I need some stimulus.

 My question is mostly, how do you guys handle the gender war on internet? I removed instagram especially because a lot of videos were coming on my feed with both genders hating eachother. I know there are women who use/hurt men and there are men who use/hurt women in real life, but I haven‚Äôt seen this much hate before in real life as well. There is so much Misandry and misogyny on internet now. And this has started happening on reddit too. I can‚Äôt help but be scared that the world is regressing. Kindness and peace is diminishing and world is picking up stupid reasons to create gender war. 

I am already too isolated, removing reddit will make me get completely cut off from outside world and I won‚Äôt known what is going on outside, I won‚Äôt be able to talk to anyone except the calls or texts once every 2-3 weeks with my cousin and friend. Here even if I don‚Äôt respond I am able to see conversation. But this gender war is bothering me.

I have tried responding that ‚Äúwe need to coexist so both genders should be respectful towards eachother, both should be accountable and take equal responsibility‚Äù. I even gave examples of how my cousin who is also preparing is married and takes tutions part time and studies the rest of time her husband is away and her husband also works full time, and they cook together, clean together, have an account where both their earnings go, there is no his money my money, and are living a peaceful life. I said there are few bad apples of both gender but this generalisation needs to stop. But I have read comments like ‚Äúthere is no pseudofeminists, feminists are bad, women shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to be educated, men who are feminists are gay, All men are rapists who didn‚Äôt get chance yet‚Äù All these comments for both genders are affecting my critical thinking as well, I am not able to understand how to respond in case the topic of misandry or misogyny arises in interview as well (I imagine every real world issue as a topic in interview and try to answer myself). 

How do you guys cope up in real life and don‚Äôt let it affect you and how would you tackle this topic on interview as well?

I was 17 (Now 27) working fast food at the time. I distinctly remember when it all changed.

Also something to consider‚Ä¶ Right before it all started, I had eaten McDonalds nearly EVERY day for a month as well as never really drank water‚Ä¶ Lots and lots of Soda. I could be putting to much thought into it being the McDonald‚Äôs or diet but I wanna give all the facts‚Ä¶

I mean if you have a two -room apartment you can't really avoid a lot, and that is somehow the problem, I think that we somehow always involuntarily wake up each other. At least we made each other coffee, and luckily he had brought a coffee machine with a jug.

So let's talk about Comicstrip's. One of the oldest forms of comics, and actually one that was not only somehow funny gags, but also there were also told real gene defenses, real eposes.
Jeff Smith Has released a comic strip in the student newspaper on the campus in the time when he studied, and who knows the name Thorn or this white figure in the corner,  notes that it is the protoversion of Bone. Sure, they are very different, but you also notice how much is similar elements.
I once asked my buddy like that how many pages do you need to tell of a comic to tell a full story, I 25 to 40 (US issue), Damian 4 to 8 (British Comics), David Just 1! The Realist from Asaf Hanuka Maybe it's a comic tip that is long over, but still remains so relevant, that's kind of sad because of the situation in the Middle East, but like he says ""In Israel you can't be apolitical"" And it is interesting that so much can tell on one page, from criticism of the Netanyahu government, to modern life and being Jewish, And really with an interesting art style that that can really very surrealistic be, David also says it is one of his great inspiration for him, and i see why.

And if I have already talked about it, I've already told David is in talk with a Publisher here in Germany and boy that is again a Shitshow. It is such a question why there are not many genre in German comics and on one side it is because a lot becomes I say that I have been overwhelmed by comics from France or well from the USA, But otherwise it is so we have always had problems with genre fiction, No matter whether normal literature, film or well comic, Precisely because many still have their thoughts it is pure escapism but I think so people, you don't look deeper either. I do not say which publisher is or the person with he talks with, because I think they also earn privacy somehow. I mean if you get questions, ""Hey cool vampire story, but why is there so much about the topic about anti -Semitism?"" When the story revolves around a Jewish community that find out that people around them turning more and more into monsters, I mean, anti -Semitism also brought people to attack their neighbors and let them do monsterrs things to other Humans. And as is common, hatred to others was always in the people until someone comes and let them really sparked it on. And it is somehow I say very entertaining to hear the email traffic he has with them, how they absolutely don't really understand what the themes are. And even independently of the topic of anti -Semitism, Doubt whether the Almighty has left us all, and well also interesting, such as the heteronormative put pressure on boys and puts them in to danger, I mean it is a reason why the vampire is a blonde bimbo from the outside but is a really brutal predator. Also the fear of telling your parents you are gay, and well he is gay too.

What exactly is as bad as a vampire? Right a werewolf! Like i say always, Archie makes the best Horror Transformation. In the Jughead the hunger it is our favorite burgerlover, which unfortunately has to be on the run because of a werewolf curse and is hunted by his friends. And I think it really goes to a very classic element of the werewolf stories, that the people unfortunately know they are a monster, and that they have to live with this fact, and somehow with this dilemma, because at the end of the day it still remains a person, but he is connected to a beast.
Anzuelo Is really one of these Strange comics that I love, basically tells of three children who are half well mutated from the sea and the question of how to continue to handle the world outside?
And the second vol of they are not like us, Also show wonderfully that not all telepaths are equal to each other. And the thing is not power corrupt's you, you have always been, until up to a position where the world notices it.
But I also want to be honest without transformation, people can be monsters, and above all you can see that in the last volume of a Righteous Thirst for Vengeance, where it breaks me.

And now I would like to go back to this old section, always make you under it, where I show you videos or youtube channels that should take a look at you.
We have here in Europe's amusement/theme parks, But as I said, Americans have, so to speak, implement this idea successfully implemented from them, above all, And even if there is only a handful of extremely big one there are still many of these little absurds, and there was such a story about which with a religious background which somehow seems pretty strange I say Christianity like that to comnationalize, but that place has interesting and controversial history, (https://youtu.be/HtYpBo-3jas?si=GlK2JQsmOltNauUJ) vid from Expedition theme park.
I once said people who never played Five Nights at Freddy's should definitely start with Secret of the Mimic. Precisely because one of the biggest reviews on the franchise is also too cryptic and it is kind of true. But this video game really gives you a full story, clearly things are left open, but you understand I say the rise and fall of a person callt Edmund the moster he made. A Let's Play Channel that I like callt the Librarian once made a let's play from this game, and it is interesting to see just about someone who has no idea about all the franchise, but have fun and I say I say a few interesting remark anyway that can never be noticed as a hardcore fan. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3ZJ0QWE7os2cI2OYbFch239bs67YceZU&si=SBlhN6z2fiqhm0Rw.
So goosebumps books have an interesting story of publication, and that's kind of fascinating. Because on one side it is really the case, it is somehow a very large franchise which never went in a straight line and also had its ups and downs itself, and it is interesting, especially that it has technically 5 main series. Matt products Makes a very interesting retrospective series about the successor series of the original Runs ( https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlb0k9589Pn7KMbA6a4azWU1i9xqltyJA&si=_uHIN71O6xhW1sSM ) and kid Leaves Stopp has a vid on a lost Books in the franchise ( https://youtu.be/nTXG1qDbOtA?si=R_doNKNPXPtiHhqe ).

I always have a fascination for the complicated story of the USSR, precisely because all of my family members grew up there and were the ball  to kick around unfortunately. In the Shadow of Stalin: The Story of Mr. Jones, is a truestory about the journalist Gareth Jones who traveled to the Soviet Union in the height of the 1930s Soviet Holodomor Famine, If you don't know what that was, the USSR literally used hunger as a weapon against the Ukrainian people there. And this comic really shows the horror that was created with Stalinism.
But too, capitalism can also be pretty bad prison. Lisa cheese and Ghost Guitar: Attack of the Snack is really a very entertaining comic over two very unequal friends who try to get through their fast food job, Also feels like a super Strange World, but at the end of the day you still notice the weight of a dead end job no matter what world.
So Tom Scioli was cooking, Space Opera Xanadax Across The Unknown Dimensions Of The Galaxy is a super long title, but it is still like I think a really fantastic science fiction story with a really ceded style, and it shows perfectly, I think why comic can be so gonzo and why i love that When I read this story about a guy on the run.
Also on the Run the Shaolin Cowboy in vol 2 Where our protagonist has to face his mistakes, but also at the same time we have fantastic action, and really a crazy America.
Ghost pepper is a newcomer who is ongoing, but it already has an interesting science fiction world about cosmic conflicts, about fanaticism, and through all a food truck that tries to go through all that to serve food.
In utero Is an Australian horror comic about two young people who come together in a rundown Mall, But you notice that in this downcoming building there are also two powers that really don't come that world. And it is a story about exclusion, and the feeling that you will never be part of something in this world.

you know I already said above  I didn't miss my work on vacation, and the first week it was very confirmed to that. Do you have that somehow that there is a person who is actually rarely right with things, but because of the fact because she/he has a high position, it can still must be done? yes that is the corporate culture with us and I want to be honest it is just really terrible. But it is also more terrible if you are given the position over the younger ones and they hav no respect from me. It's terrible if someone always insults you, Especially when you hav very little confidence in yourself and always hav the thoughts you have achieved nothing in 26 years of your life. Sure you can say, hey I still achieved more than these three cheese high, but On the other hand, they have been mentally immune because of the fact because they Lieing to them self that this shitty Twitch career still gets upswing at some point. This is a warehouse written by Kafka.

So now to the Superheros!!!

Mighty Morphin and Powerrangers vol 5 Telling half of about getting up after a pretty strong fight you won, but still be broken. is interesting in general just how the comics really tell this concept further.
You have to know Power Rangers is a strange beast in general, precisely because the strange translation of Japanese Tokusatsu. Tokusatsu Is a Japanese genre what you could most likely compare with superheroes in the West, but it has some other elements, especially monsters because it is a subgenres from Kaij≈´ cinema. Kaijumax season 4 was primarily a prison parody with huge monsters, but now it is more and more towards the deconstruction of well Tokusatsu, Where, in a way, these heroes are shown a bit there than, well I would not say they are all corrupt, but they also have their problems just say what they really do in this world.
Also what I find cool when we already talk about superheroes who are not American, Captain Britten. It is not really easy for Marvel put lot of the past of her British comics to the app, and that makes sense because British comics have had a different structure, namely with magazines instead of the classic Issue's, But that's why I love it when you manage to achieve it, and I just wish you a lot more of it, please?
50 years of Giant Size X-Men Is a declaration of love for classic X-Men Comics, plus I like MS.Marvel.
Convergence Batman and Robin Let Batman fight against each other, and you really notice that somehow Bruce I say a complicated father.
Superman: the Phantom Zone Is a collection of different comics through the decades, which has this concept of the phantom zone, and it is somehow an interesting concept that is often forgotten in the big superman myth.
Evil's Night is green lantern Elseworlds, An interpretation of them in the 1920s, And it tells of a handful of people who will get a special green ring, in a time when people looking for miracles.
new fantastic four Was a small story Ark in the 80s, where the team of the Fantastischen Four was ko, and the combo was Cool. The what if tells what if unfortunately this team has to be longer to be fantastic four and what consequences it was.

I'm absolutely finished I'll say and I just really feel like tomorrow to stand there again. But what does that have to be done, but if I try to survive it. 
I hope I have a better week than mine and stays on reading.

She told me, she saw me checking out doc and I looked like I was into him. I wasn‚Äôt really sure how to react so I folded my arms to listen. She explained that she had ONS with Doc during a theme party. Apparently the experience was so bad, it was one for the books.  She said she wore a chicken costume and he came in as an egg.

S&W Peru Le Palto Natual. This may be a top coffee of the year for me. I got my first shipment of S&W last month and this was the standout.

1nay6uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wien/comments/1nay6uf/whats_going_on_with_the_prices_of_groceries/,What's going on with the prices of groceries?,"I Shop once a week, given our restricted schedule, and attempt to purchase everything we might need.  There always are exceptions during the week, but my goal is to have a majority of the items required quickly cook up something, conveniently available in the kitchen. We're a family of four - parents and two kids.

We cook everyday,  and eat lunch and dinner at home or from homemade meals. We always have food ready to be heated  up in the fridge, and our meals are made of basic ingredients: veggies, lentils, beans etc. Very seldom: pasta or home made pizza. 

We don't eat meat other than cold cuts for sandwiches or the occasional fishsticks for the kids. Fish is too expensive to even bother.

I just wanted to lay that out to paint you a picture; there are absolutely no ""luxury"" items on our shopping list, unless you count fruit yogurt or fresh produce, or something other than the most basic, cheapest m√ºsli or cheese, as luxury. We barely consume alcohol, perhaps a bottle of wine once every 2-3 weeks among two adults. No soft drinks, perhaps some nuts and dried fruits as snacks, which we've also reduced recently due to an increase in price.

Prior to covid, i could do most of the weekly shopping for around 50-70 euros. This included eggs, milk, fresh produce, and even some chocolate and coffee.
Recently I'm noticing the bill comes to over 100 euros each trip, and i no longer purchase coffee (unless it's at a discount, a pack of decent coffee costs over 10 euros now) or chocolates, and always shop  at hofer or lidl.

I dont understand what's happening. Our monthly grocery bill comes to around 500 euros for a family - not counting additional purchases during the week like brot or semmel, or oils, sauces etc.

That's a serious amount, depending on your income level.

I know it would cost more if we were to order out etc, but we dont. I also know many pay more and our budget is quite frugal. 

I understand but that's not the point. I'm trying to discern how the prices doubled and almost tripled in the last 2-3 years. It sure crept on us slowly - and as prices went up, sizes and amounts of products went down.

 How is this possible. Could someone explain why everything is so expensive suddenly? Im at a loss as to how we're supposed to manage without making serious concessions if it continues like this...

1nay5us,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlasticObesity/comments/1nay5us/traditional_foods_1_traditional_vs_pretend/,Traditional Foods (1): Traditional vs Pretend Traditional,"I would like to put forward a very controversial take - cooking real traditional foods *requires less time, less skill & less money than cooking modern food from supermarket*.  But the main reason we don't cook them is because they do not meet our current cultural standards.

Hear me out... while I ramble through a bit of personal experience & food history. [& take a swipe at the 'homesteading with 10 kids' trend for comic effect]

**********

I grew up in a household that produced & preserved a lot of its food: maize, chickens, pigs, cow, goats, fruit, vegetables, wine, spirits, basic cheeses, you name it. It also bought some in (sunflower oil, bread, fish, beer, coffee, sugar and any fancy food we happened to fancy - pastries, candy, salami, etc.). 

My grandparents made their living farming & trading agricultural produce before the 50-60s, when communism put a stop to that, and they got back into it the moment communism fell. My parents had professional jobs, but in 90s Eastern Europe, years of hyperinflation and salaries not paid on time turned producing your own food something that made money sense.

So the entire family ended up working at least part time on my grandparents farm, each to their own abilities. It was fun to live in a multi-generational household with a bit of land & and there was always tasty food around. It's grandparents' job to cook to look after the kids while parents work outside the home. Hanging out with people born in the 1920s also means you also end up knowing more about how sh*t got done in the past than most people your age!

One of the things you can observe is how much time & how much skill is it really needed to prepare traditional food from scratch. And the answer is - for day to day things - not a lot. I learned most of it, just by paying attention to what they are doing, until the age of 12-13. 

Most real traditional recipes are *a lot easier to make than the brownies & cakes kids get taught to make in food technology class in school*! 

And the ones that do require time & skill to make - you don't actually need to make these days!

************

Before getting to that, it is essential to distinguish *traditional food* that would have actually been prepared in a household VS *pretend traditional food*. 

Because with all the recent social media grifting in all directions (cooking influencers, baking influencers, tradwifes, homesteading, etc. all trying to sell you something), I think people don't really understand what traditional foods are any more. And they think they're these super complicated, time consuming things while industry makes modern cooking easy. 

That could not be further from the truth. Let's exemplify.

******************

*Sourdough bread*

What the internet sells you - https://grantbakes.com/good-sourdough-bread/

- perfectly formed, 'sourdough ear', perfectly risen, 'open crumb', 8+ hours of fiddling with the dough, need for kitchen scales, proofing baskets, scoring tools, dutch oven, ultra high protein white flour, etc. Feeding the starter every day, to get that rise, making pre-ferments, whatever. 

- no-one in their right minds making bread back in the day would have done that. In fact a lot of bakeries were ditching sourdough leavening methods as early as 1800s in favour of using brewers' yeast instead for more reliable rise & less sour taste. But it was retained for things like rye breads where it works better taste wise. 

- My grandma only made sourdough when things were tough after the war and it was hard to get hold of fresh yeast. And bought bread, whenever possible ... because most villages had bakeries, or at least communal ovens, in the last 500+ years. And in her village the bakers went around the village delivering warm bread to your door! So baking was done at home... only if you lived in remote locations. 

- a lot of today's beautifully presented home-made sourdough craze is an imaginary tradition. Grandma did not have time for that sh*t.

VS

Reality: Baking bread in 21st centure, if you really want to!

- mixing any dough takes 5 mins. Add 10 mins more if you bother kneading (I don't). Sourdough starters last for months without feeding in fridge - so don't feed them!

- what to mix? Here's the simplest, most versatile baker's formula  - if wheat flour weight is 100, add 65 of water, 15 of sourdough starter (or 1 of yeast) and 1-2 of salt. After measuring a few times, you'll be able to just wing it! 

- So mix some dough, watch telly for a few hours in the evening while that dough rises (1st rise) & put it in the fridge before you go to sleep (2nd rise). Put it in shapes for proofing if you can be bothered. If not - 

- Bake whenever you want in the next 2-4 days (dought keeps in the fridge), as flat bread on the hob, in the pan (10 mins)

- Total work time: 25mins, max (less if you have the dough in fridge already). Taste & nutrition - same as fancy sourdough. Looks - good enough. Skill level - 12 year old could do it. 

- Time to go to the shop to buy tasteless fluffy bread - 15mins. Time to find a decent bakery - a lot more than that! If you like good bread, making it makes sense. 


*****************

*Stock*

What the internet sells you - https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_make_beef_stock/

- hours of boiling, taking foam off, lots of spices, sometimes even roasting bones beforehand (!), using meat which you then discard due to overboiling (!!), straining... needing beef, chicken, lamb, veal, vegetable stock... 

- and you absolutely need it for every single damn dish, from soups, to rice dishes to even stews. Why would anyone use stock for anything that involves cooking meat in liquid for a long time already (like a stew) is beyond me. The 'bone broth' brigade clearly put broth on a pedestal recently!

- OK - stocks or 'fonds the cuisine', as we currently know and use them are an invention of French Haute Cuisine in the 1800s & onwards. These chefs were cooking for rich folk, who had steaks & roasts all the time that needed sauces, made with stock & cream & whatever. They formalised the use of stock in various types of dishes too. 

- Grandma did not cook that much steak & roasts. She did not have that much meat all the time & meat was surely not wasted to make stock! And she was not cooking restaurant meals every day either!


VS

Reality: Slow cooking with bone in meats

- slow cooking was very popular in the past when people had wood fired stoves serving as 2in1 cookers & central heating - and all you had to do is leave something on it simmering while you slept or did something else. Broths were a tasty way of using... well, scraps. Those broths - today's bones & scraps, cooked overnight for tomorrow's soup (or base for some other dish). They were not really... restaurant quality!

- but with the advent of modern gas hobs & ovens & central heating *as separate things* 50 odd years ago (in the West) - slow cooking turned expensive & impractical and fell out of fashion for a while. Stock started to be bought in shops because we wanted to speed up cooking.

- another thing that was popular was buying & cooking bone-in meat, and all parts of the animal (or slaughtering your own!). That also fell out of fashion recently when everyone started thinking meat on the bone is a bit ewwww & poor man'a food. So now we have steaks & roast that need stock for sauces...

- but you can buy meat with bone from butchers & go back to slow cooking right now, with a 70 quid electric slow cooker. You can make whatever broth & stew you want while you watch telly or wfh! It is much cheaper & better for you than a (plastic) airfrier and the 'pull out of the bag' dishes typically cooked in it! 

- You can also just ditch stock alltogether in a lot of recipes because is either not needed in the first place or slow cooking meat with bone as part of the recipe will be more than enough to give it taste. 

- Zero waste, cheaper cuts of meat, tastier eats, no money spent on fancy stocks & sauces that go off before you use them, only a little bit of extra time. Skill level - 12 year old can do it. It's just boiling. 

*******************

*Pastries & Cakes*

What the internet sells you - home made fluffy, fancy cakes and deserts & a lot of puff pastries! 

- these things were never ever, ever the preserve of home cooking. They were fancy goods, traditionally consumed by the rich & prepared by skilled domestic servants or actual commercial pattiseries.

- they need a ridiculous amount of skill, time, equipment & expensive, specialist ingredients. Let me be clear - your European great great grandma was *not * making puff pastry & cakes! She knew better than to try & replicate commercial foods at home from scratch! Yet today's random working mum throwing a dinner party is kinda expected to have the skill to cook some of this stuff... where did that come from? Read on...

- croissants (and laminated puff pastry in general - saussage rolls, pain au chocolat, danish pastry, whatever) have been invented by bakeries in the late 1800s in Vienna & refined in Paris (where the style of pastry is still called 'viennoiserie'), initially to cater to a rich & refined clientele. Butter laminate pastry only became a thing with the less rich around 80-100 years ago, because producing it efficiently needs machinery! Making it by hand is just too fiddly, time consuming and a pain in the *ss for bakeries!

- fluffy fancy cakes & deserts - in the 50s & 60s, in the West, it was felt that the newly established 'homemakers' in those single income households, did not have enough work to feel satisfied, with all those new kitchen appliances! So society had to give them something to do, that was deemed womanly - and one of those things was - fancy cake & desert making! And that became the thing in women's magazines & the expectation levied on housewives of reasonable means. Again, great great grandma did not have time or money for this sh*t!

- so cakes & laminated pastry are pretend traditions & accidents of history, not traditional foods.

VS

Reality: Shortcrust, enriched breads & baking powder

- most home made pastries would been short crust based - pies, biscuits, savoury pasties, etc. Shortcrust is very easy to make - just mix flour, water & some lard or butter + salt / sugar. Roll, fill and bake - that's it! No laminating, no yeast, no equipment or controlled temperatures needed.  Better taste than the puff pastry stuff that takes most bakery shop space today - but less light, fluffy or visually appealing!

- at holiday times, you'd get some enriched breads (things like sweet buns or loaves - which are the bread recipe + milk, whipped eggs & sugar & a bit more kneading). But even that was considered hard work & expensive and reserved for... Easter & Christmas! 

- the invention of baking soda in the 1800s brought about a few more easy to make deserts: muffins, scones, American pancakes - all which involve making a batter of flour+milk/eggs+sugar.

- shortcrust & baking soda pastries are super easy & cheap to make with basic cupboard ingredients - skill level - 12 year old can do it! Enriched breads are a bit more complicated, but no rocket science either.


*************

You get the picture... most real traditional foods are easy to make with little skill & require few basic ingredients. They were also convenient to cook back in the day, often while doing something else. Fancy home made food were reserved for holidays only. The people who invented these foods were too busy making a living, just like you!

Pretend traditional foods are fiddly, time consuming & needlesly complicated - and used to be made comercially, by skilled producers of the past, for people who could afford them. They were often status symbols back in the day too. 

Because believe it or not, commerce and specialised production existed since the dawn of humanity and most people did not live by themselves in the middle of nowhere. And the ancestors had lords of the mannor whose lifestyle they wanted to copy and friends & neighbours to impress too!

But the internet blurs the line between these types of foods because it has things to sell and engagement to generate. Real traditional foods are too simple and too un-cool to do either of those things. So as with all things internet related, you may be better served if you source most of your recipes offline rather than online!

I‚Äôve sunk an embarrassing number of hours into it, my coffee machine is filing a labor complaint, and I still don‚Äôt have a clean fix.

Long version for the curious and the chaos-lovers:

* The ‚Äústarts playing then gives up two seconds later‚Äù gremlin is not universal, but it‚Äôs frequent enough to ruin the fun.
* The last update helped a few edge cases, but it also opened new ones. Love that for us.
* I‚Äôve tried different buffer strategies, connection settings, and metadata parsing paths. The result: I can either keep playback reliable or keep metadata for tricky stations. Not both, not yet.

* Only some formats fail (HLS vs MP3 vs AAC), or a station plays only after several retries
* Battery saver/VPN/Data Saver causing extra drama

**What helps me fix it faster:**

* Station name (+ direct stream URL if you have it)
* Your device + Android version + app version (Settings ‚Üí About)
* Where it happens: Wi-Fi, mobile data, Bluetooth, Android Auto
* Any patterns you noticed (e.g., ‚Äúdies exactly when the song title changes‚Äù)

His enthusiasm for life and poker is a joy to behold. Having followed his career for a number of years, I thought it would be an excellent time to catch up with the Austrian Native Pro who is genuinely one of the nicest guys out there in poker. His challenges are what defines him, his exuberance to take on any situation really shows his mental state. He also loves to take part in Iron mans which showcases his physical attributes very well.

With that being said, its time to get to know Seb on a lighter note, because in reality, that is how he would have wanted this to go. Lets jump right into it!

[Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber](https://preview.redd.it/d1tw3kmqtrnf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d552898d9315d53ba6c302b02d8fbeb5e9ccf66)

# 20 fun, slightly off-beat questions for Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber

1.¬†**Your Instagram bio calls you a PokerStars Ambassador and Twitch grinder.**¬†When did you first realise streaming cards could become a¬†*career*, and what‚Äôs the one thing about ambassador life that totally blindsided you?

The first moment I realised it could become a career was winning the dare 2 stream competition. It‚Äôs very rare that I got so nervous in the final hours of the competition. All in all, it is just amazing how much support I get from pokerstars. That helps me out a lot as a professional poker-streamer.

2. You famously¬†*won*¬†it‚Äôs021 Dare2Stream contest. Looking back, what was the wildest on-stream moment‚Äîhand, tech fail or community meme‚Äîthat you think clinched the title?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

During that contest I did a 24 hour stream and people were absolutely hyped about such a thing. Besides that there was one stream where I sat on my bike riding on swift while playing cards and streaming. That was a very unique combination and I had a lot of fun. In the end I think my consistency was the key for my success.

3. During your $100 ‚Üí $10 000 bankroll challenge (wrapped in just 95 broadcast days!), which rule you set for yourself proved hardest to stick with‚Äîand would you change it if you ran it back?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

There was no proper rule in that challenge, but it was very important to stick to a good bankroll-management. Without that, people would not have taken it seriously and most likely I would have failed. In hindsight, I would study more often during the challenge for sure.

4. You‚Äôve joked you‚Äôre ‚Äúthe best¬†**pocket-kings**¬†player on PokerStars.‚Äù What secret sauce turns kings into your spirit animal‚Äîand have they ever stabbed you in the back at a final table?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

That is a running joke in my community, because KKs got cracked too often in one stream and now I try to reverse it with saying I am the best KK player. So actually they have stabbed me in the back multiple times.

5. 2024 was your¬†*first*¬†full season on the EPT tour‚ÄîBarcelona, Paris, Prague and more. Which stop felt like a cosy home game, and which city taught you the toughest off-table lesson?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

2024 I played my first EPT Main Events and got absolutely destroyed. In Barcelona, there was one moment where Sam Greenwood sat to my right after busting the 100k and I thought ‚Äúoh my, what on earth am I doing here‚Äù. I learned a lot on that table.

6. About that spontaneous¬†**24-hour Twitch marathon**¬†(219 tourneys!): What kept you level at hour 20, and which midnight snack was the real MVP?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

I am just surviving those things because I do a lot of sports and keep my body as strong as possible. MVP was definitely a good coffee, lots of sweet snacks and in the end I may have rewarded me with one or two beers üòÄ

7. You‚Äôve now bagged¬†**two WCOOP titles and a debut SCOOP win in 2025.**¬†Which trophy owns the most shelf space in your heart‚Äîand why?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

All 3 are special, because winning a poker tournament is very tough and you have to get very lucky. If I have to pick one it might be the latest title, the $55 SCOOP 8-Game. I picked up my game to another level and I am very proud of that.

8. You‚Äôre also studying¬†**business psychology**¬†in Vienna. Does reading about human behaviour give you a live-tell edge‚Äîor just bulk up your study procrastination?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

I wish, might be a thing when I am getting more comfortable in live poker.

9. Last summer you smashed an¬†**Olympic-distance triathlon**¬†(1.5 km swim / 40 km bike / 10.6 km run). Which leg hurt most‚Äîand did any poker-mindset trick save you on the course?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

Just love doing sports besides sitting all day long in front of a pc. The interesting part is that triathlon and poker are both mentally very tough. So, you can learn a lot form each other.

10. Football, tennis, endurance sports‚Äîyou did them all growing up. If PokerStars asked you to invent a three-part¬†*Poker Triathlon*, what events would make the cut?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

I would start with a vanilla tournament, second would be heads up and the last discipline would be a 10-game.

11. What song flips you straight into ‚ÄúA-game‚Äù mode‚Äîand which guilty-pleasure playlist would horrify your chat if it leaked?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

If I need to get into the zone, I definitely play a lot of old school US hip hop. And no, I don‚Äôt have a single song that would be bad for me if it got leaked. I listen every weird song on stream. I have no song secrets ;D

12. Do you have a non-poker superstition (lucky socks, special breakfast) before big events?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

I love my red coloured lucky sport socks üòÄ

13. From Austrian winter to Bahamian sunshine at¬†**PCA 2023**, what‚Äôs your go-to packing hack for keeping the workout routine alive on the road?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

My running shoes, you can do that very easily in every country you are traveling to.

14. What‚Äôs the one¬†*fail clip*¬†your community still teases you about that never made it to Instagram reels?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

I guess I don‚Äôt have any, because my lovely community pushes me to upload all my stupid mistakes

15. Team peace&loove is a tight-knit bunch‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the nicest or weirdest piece of fan mail or message you‚Äôve ever received?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

One lovely member of my community made a song about me and my stream, that was very special! The song is called Peace&Loove from KingsKrushers on spotify.

16. If we peeked at your phone‚Äôs health app, which stat would impress us more‚Äîstep streak, hours slept, or language-learning run?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

Hours slept hahahaha

17. Which Viennese caf√© fuels your study sessions, and what‚Äôs your usual order while reviewing hands?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

Love all the cafes in Vienna after a tough day of wcoop, especially those with a nice view over the Danube

18. PokerStars hands you a free downtown-Vienna billboard for 24 hours. What message‚Äîpoker or personal‚Äîdo you plaster on it?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

My face with pocket kings üòÄ

19. You live in poker emojis ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô†Ô∏è, but which non-poker emoji best sums up¬†*non-streamer*¬†Sebastian?

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

üö¥definitely the bike emoji

20. Finish this sentence: ‚ÄúMost people don‚Äôt know that when the cameras are off, I love to ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù

**Sebastian ‚Äúpeace&loove‚Äù Huber**

Enjoy my time with my fianc√©, family, friends and do a lot of sports.

It was an absolute pleasure to get to chatting to Seb over the last few weeks via Instagram and he was ever so kind to take the time out of his busy schedule to answer some great questions.

Up next is EPT Malta were I already know that Seb has qualified for the Pokerstars Malta Open Cup ‚Äì where he will be doing his best to go as deep as possible in the event. EPT Malta takes place between the 1st and the 12th of October with a wide array of poker tournament, taking place in the centre of the Mediterranean.

Make sure you get down to Malta to enjoy the festivities that pokerstars and Malta have to offer!

1nay01t,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1nay01t/genesis_mnemosyne/,Genesis Mnemosyne,"Hi Yall,

I share this here because im sitting on this beast for a while now. I started out because I wanted an emergent story engine that would truly run multiple llm agents with each their own seperate memory streams, short and long term, memory decay, emotions all of it, and I  couldnt find it. So I coded it, for months I sat frantically slamming my keyboard, then it was kinda finished. Now I mainly use it to create a world thah feels lived in, it can be themed in anything, it works best as supplement material allong with a good prompt, it also works wonders to hold seperate characters. I didnt know where to share it so I drop it here first, to see if there is any interest at all, if there is, I will be sharing more, stories woven from the simulation logs (just pour the log into an llm) and ofcourse the python source code itself so you can use it , and alter it yourself. here is an overview of the system:

System Overview

Genesis Mnemosyne is a Python-based platform where multiple AI agents interact in a shared environment. Each

agent maintains persistent memory (vector embeddings in SQLite), evolving personality parameters, and

relationship tracking. The simulation generates detailed logs that can be processed by LLMs into various

narrative formats.

Technical Architecture

Core Components:

\- 8 autonomous agents (GPT-5 with reasoning\_effort parameter)

\- Vector-based semantic memory (1536-dim embeddings via text-embedding-3-small)

\- Three-stage action pipeline (deliberation ‚Üí parsing ‚Üí arbitration)

\- Persistent world state (JSON) with feature tracking

\- SQLite databases for short and long-term memory

Key Metrics:

\- \~8,000 lines of Python

\- 15-30 seconds per turn processing

\- 2000-4000 tokens per agent per turn

\- Memory retrieval: <100ms using cosine similarity

Narrative Generation Pipeline

1. Simulation Phase: Agents act based on personality + memories + current context
2. Log Capture: All actions, dialogue, and internal states recorded
3. Story Generation: Logs fed to LLM with genre/style parameters
4. Output: Coherent narrative maintaining character consistency

Example Workflow:

\# Run simulation

python bigbrother\_main.py -t 100  # 100 turns

\# Log output includes:

\# - Agent deliberations (internal monologue)

\# - Actions taken (movement, dialogue, interactions)

\# - World state changes

\# - Relationship updates

\# Process with any LLM:

prompt = """"""

Convert the following simulation logs into a third-person narrative.

Maintain character voices and integrate internal thoughts naturally.

Focus on psychological tension.

\[logs\]

""""""

Emergent Behavior Observations

The system exhibits several interesting properties:

1. Personality Evolution: Agents modify their core traits based on experiences. Tracked on 4 axes (trauma,

bonding, power, madness) with threshold-triggered rewrites.

2. Narrative Coherence: Despite no central planning, agents maintain consistent story threads across hundreds of

turns through memory persistence.

3. Genre Drift: Initial ""Big Brother reality TV"" theme evolved into psychological horror without programmatic

changes - purely through agent interactions.

Memory System Details

\# Retrieval algorithm (simplified)

def get\_relevant\_memories(agent\_id, context, k=5):

context\_embedding = get\_embedding(context)

for memory in agent\_memories:

relevance = cosine\_similarity(memory.vector, context\_embedding)

recency = 0.97 \*\* (current\_time - memory.timestamp)

importance = memory.importance\_score / 10

score = 0.6 \* relevance + 0.2 \* recency + 0.2 \* importance

return top\_k\_memories

Practical Applications

1. Procedural Story Generation: Each run produces unique narratives while maintaining internal consistency
2. Character Development Studies: Observable personality evolution through quantified emotional scoring
3. Dialogue Generation: Natural conversations emerge from agent interactions without scripting
4. Multi-POV Narratives: Same events captured from multiple agent perspectives

Implementation Notes

\- Built on OpenAI's GPT-5 API (using new reasoning\_effort parameter instead of temperature)

\- Agents share no internal state - information only flows through observed actions

\- World state changes require ""Dungeon Master"" arbitration for consistency

\- Goal evaluation includes caching layer to reduce API calls by \~20%

Current Limitations

\- Token costs scale linearly with agent count and turn length

\- Personality evolution can amplify initial biases over time

\- Genre drift is difficult to constrain without modifying base prompts

\- Memory retrieval occasionally surfaces irrelevant but semantically similar content

Use Cases for Writers

The system works well as a ""narrative generator"" that produces raw story material:

\- Generate character interactions for specific scenarios

\- Explore how different personality combinations create conflict

\- Create training data for fine-tuning narrative models

\- Prototype branching storylines through multiple runs

Performance Considerations

\- SQLite with WAL mode for concurrent memory access

\- Persistent connections reduce overhead

\- Vector operations optimized with NumPy

\- Fuzzy matching (thefuzz library) for entity resolution

I'm having trouble finding answer to several questions.

**Water vs Yield Amount**

The instructions from the website (below) do not say how much water to use, the amount of grounds, or the yield I should expect in coffee. The paper instructions say ""see table for the appropriate amounts"", but there is no table. One unclear diagram says 170ml of water should result in 160ml of coffee, but when I tried this I only got 93ml of coffee. There were 60ml of water/coffee left in the boiler.

For the aluminum model, I know you fill water to the valve, but I can't tell if the instruction is the same for the induction model. If I fill to the valve, it's 330ml of water, but the included measuring cup only goes to 200ml.

**Cold or Hot Water**

In addition, the instructions say to use cold water, but I thought you were supposed to use hot. Maybe it's different for the induction model.

**Stove Temp**

The instructions also don't way to reduce the heat once you start to see coffee, but I thought that was a normal step.

**EDIT (forgot to add): Grounds**

Should I be filling the filter basket to the top? That's 30g of coffee. A 1:10 ratio would only be 17g for 170ml of water.

**WEBSITE INSTRUCTIONS: How to prepare coffee**:

1. Fill heater with cold water by using the graduated measuring cup supplied.
2. Insert the funnel filter into the heater.
3. Fill the funnel filter with ground coffee for Moka, without pressing it down, taking care not to leave coffee powder on the rim of the coffee maker.
4. Screw the upper part on the heater and tighten well, without pressing too much and avoiding to force the handle.
5. Put the coffee maker on the heat source. In case of flame, prevent it from going beyond the rim of the coffee unit. In case of induction/electric/ceramic glass plate, do not use the highest heat.
6. In few minutes a small amount of coffee will start coming out and the typical puff of Brikka, signalling the beginning of froth formation, will be heard.
7. After few seconds, make sure froth formation has been completed inside the upper part.
8. Pour coffee into the cups, evenly distributing the coffee and froth.",3,1757263075.0,mokapot,2,1.0,False

Daily Acts of Self-Love: Simple Practices to Nurture Your Well-Being

In a world that moves quickly, it‚Äôs easy to forget that we are more than what we do or achieve. We often give so much of ourselves to work, family, and obligations that we forget to refill our own cup. This is where self-love steps in‚Äînot as a luxury, but as a necessity.

Self-love isn‚Äôt about grand gestures or a perfectly curated lifestyle. It‚Äôs about the small, daily acts that remind us of our worth, restore our energy, and nurture our hearts. When practiced regularly, these moments of care and compassion create a foundation for resilience, happiness, and growth.

Today, let‚Äôs explore some simple but powerful ways you can practice self-love every day.

1. Speak Kindly to Yourself

One of the most profound acts of self-love is shifting the way you talk to yourself. Think about the last time you made a mistake‚Äîwere your words forgiving, or were they harsh and critical?

The truth is, many of us are harder on ourselves than we would ever be on someone else. By learning to replace self-criticism with compassion, we create space for healing and growth.

Try this: Next time you catch yourself in negative self-talk, pause and ask: Would I say this to someone I care about? If not, reframe your words into something kinder. Simple affirmations like ‚ÄúI am learning, I am growing, and I am enough‚Äù can shift your mindset over time.

2. Create Space for Rest

Self-love also means honoring your body‚Äôs need for rest. In our productivity-driven culture, rest is often mistaken for laziness. But true rest is fuel‚Äîit allows you to show up refreshed and present.

Try this: Schedule short ‚Äúrest breaks‚Äù throughout your day. Step outside, take a mindful breath, or close your eyes for a few minutes. At night, create a simple routine that signals your body it‚Äôs time to unwind‚Äîmaybe a cup of tea, journaling, or stretching.

3. Nourish Your Body with Care

Food is more than fuel‚Äîit‚Äôs a form of self-respect. Nourishing your body doesn‚Äôt mean rigid diets or cutting out every indulgence. It means listening to what your body needs and choosing foods that make you feel energized and supported.

Try this: Instead of labeling foods as ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad,‚Äù approach your meals with curiosity. Ask yourself: How does this food make me feel? Pay attention to meals that give you energy and leave you feeling balanced, and make those a regular part of your routine.

4. Set Gentle Boundaries

Boundaries are one of the clearest forms of self-love. They allow us to protect our time, energy, and mental health. Saying ‚Äúno‚Äù can be difficult, but every time you set a healthy boundary, you‚Äôre sending yourself a message: I matter.

Try this: Start small. If you tend to overcommit, practice saying: ‚ÄúThank you for thinking of me, but I can‚Äôt take this on right now.‚Äù Boundaries don‚Äôt have to be harsh‚Äîthey can be firm yet kind.

5. Celebrate Small Wins

Too often, we wait for big milestones before we give ourselves permission to celebrate. But every step forward‚Äîno matter how small‚Äîis worth acknowledging.

Try this: At the end of each day, write down one thing you‚Äôre proud of. It could be as simple as making a healthy meal, practicing gratitude, or saying no when you needed to. Over time, these daily wins build confidence and momentum.

6. Practice Mindful Moments

Self-love doesn‚Äôt always require extra time‚Äîit‚Äôs often about presence. Whether you‚Äôre sipping your morning coffee, walking outside, or folding laundry, you can turn ordinary moments into opportunities for mindfulness.

Try this: Choose one daily activity and give it your full attention. Notice the sights, sounds, and sensations. This practice grounds you in the present and reminds you that your life is happening now‚Äînot just in the future.

7. Affirm Your Worth Daily

Affirmations are short, powerful statements that help rewire the way you think. When repeated regularly, they become anchors of self-belief.

Try this: Start your morning by looking in the mirror and repeating:
‚ÄúI honor my journey, I embrace my worth, and I choose to love myself deeply with every step I take.‚Äù

This may feel uncomfortable at first, but with practice, it becomes a natural part of your inner dialogue.

Self-Love is a Daily Choice

Self-love isn‚Äôt a destination‚Äîit‚Äôs a daily choice. It‚Äôs not about doing everything perfectly but about creating space for compassion, rest, and joy in your life. Each small act of love you give yourself ripples outward, influencing your relationships, your work, and your ability to live authentically.

So today, choose one simple act of self-love and make it part of your routine. With consistency, these small practices become a way of life.

Because the truth is: when you nurture yourself, you create the foundation for everything else to thrive. üå∏

1naxr92,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1naxr92/my_partner_18f_and_i_20f_just_broke_up_last/,My partner (18F) and I (20F) just broke up last Sunday over issues that I know are fixable. How do I go about regaining her trust again and rebuilding what we had?,"We have been together for 2 and a half years and have done everything imaginable with each other. We met when I was in my senior year of high school and she was in her sophomore year. When we first started talking, the connection was magnetic. We couldn't stay away from each other, and I had never felt so connected with someone. I come from a very rough upbringing, and my communication was never amazing. Early in the relationship, I would get upset over something sort of small, and I would shut down due to my emotions being super heavy to process. Not because I wanted to shut her out, I wanted to tell her everything, but I just physically couldn't get any words out. Of course, that would freak her out and upset her. We worked through that together. I started being more open about my feelings, and we would work everything out. After the first 6 months together, I went away to college about an hour from our hometown. I would spend my weekends with her, sometimes bringing her down to my college to visit for a night, but mainly heading over to her house to spend the weekend. During this time, I was working full-time while also attending classes, but I always made it work. After my first year in college, over the summer, we had gotten even closer. I would spend days on end at her house, and she would spend days at my house. I was incredibly ingrained in her family life, going on their annual family vacations and spending holidays. Because we started to get so close, we didn't leave any room for ourselves during this time. I started to assume that my free time would be spent with her, and that she would feel the same way. Last December, I went with her family on a ski trip. One day, she was telling me that she wanted to spend a day with her friends after the trip to work on something. I had gotten very upset because I had assumed she would spend the day with me since I had taken that day off from work for her. I shut down completely. I couldn't tell her how I felt because my emotions were just too heavy. This moment damaged the relationship I had with her for a short period of time, and damaged the relationship I had with her mother as well. After that trip, we started to get into more arguments. Around that time, I had my own apartment on my college campus, but I would still spend many nights at her house. Again, not giving each other space, but we were so in love, we didn't care, we just wanted to see each other. We always said we couldn't sleep as well when we were alone. In February of this year. We had gotten into some kind of argument that I can't even remember. She had asked to take a break. She was going on a school trip, so the time apart would have happened naturally, but she was telling me how she felt suffocated, like I depended too much on her. She told me she felt that she couldn't feel free to see her friends because it would upset me. I apologized immediately and told her I would do my best to work on that. I told her I would return to therapy and start taking my medications again (I have bipolar disorder). Although I did do a better job of letting her have her time seeing her friends, I didn't return to therapy. I felt like I had so much on my plate and not enough time or money to do it. I deeply regret this. She requested a 2-week break, and of course, I accepted this. Two days go by, and she tells me to come over and that she misses me. I was a mess. I was so confused. I didn't understand why she would change her mind on this. The break was not supposed to be a no-contact break; she told me that she wanted to hear from me, so we did speak, just not as often. I, of course, went to see her that night she told me to come over, which, looking back, I probably shouldn't have done. I asked her why she changed her mind, and she said that she thought the break was what she wanted, but it turns out it wasn't. I accepted the answer, though I was sort of heartbroken. I was processing the break like a breakup. I truly thought she was done with me. Time went on, and we didn't have another incident until maybe April. I was going through a lot. I had to find a new job because I was medically advised to leave my career, so I was unemployed and spending all of my time at her house. I don't even remember what our argument was about. But she had told me that this cycle of arguments would not continue, and if she felt hurt again, that would be her last time. I agreed, I didn't want to keep fighting either. From then on, we had a good time. We recently went on a couple's trip in the middle of August. We started talking about our intentions for the future, like marriage, family, etc. Throughout the relationship, we had these kinds of talks, but I led the conversation on engagement in the past month. I wanted to know where her head was at. I had asked her if I proposed now, would she accept. She told me yes. I had planned to propose in the next 2 years. When it came to family talks, she always told me she wanted kids. I expressed to her how hesitant I was to have children, especially with my upbringing. I told her I was afraid I couldn't be a good mother. But something about this girl made me reconsider. I knew that if I had her as a partner that I could do anything. I wanted to do anything. No other partner in my life has made me feel that way. She moved into college 2 hours away from our hometown just last week, Aug 26th. I helped her move in, and we had a great day. It was bittersweet. During her first week at college, things got a little tense. I was upset that she wasn't speaking to me much, and I felt bad that I was the one to keep reaching out first. She told me she realized she wasn't making a good enough effort, but that the next weeks coming up will be better since she will be more adjusted to college life. I tried to believe her, but I was so wrapped up in my emotions that it was hard. When I saw her again on Sunday, I was moving my brother into college (the same one) and asked to meet up. We had the intention of seeing each other that day since I left her on Tuesday. I think that there was miscommunication during this event. I think she believed that it would be a quick visit since I was on campus, so I thought I would spend my day with her. At first, I asked how long she wanted to see me, and she said at least two hours. Then I later asked how late I should stay. She told me 8 pm. I was fine with this. When the day came, she had texted me that she had something to do with her friend at 6:30 pm, but until that time, I was all hers. I completely misread the text through the chaos of moving things and thought she said she was busy until 6:30 pm. I was upset, I responded, ""What the hell? I thought we were hanging out."" Then I immediately responded, ""I'm so sorry, I read that completely wrong. I thought you were telling me to wait until 6:30."" We brushed past that incident. After I finished setting my brother up, I told her I was coming to meet her. I picked her up and we went to lunch. In the car ride over there, I had asked to talk. I told her that since she is not very far away from home, I would like to see her every weekend. She had originally planned to come home every other weekend (even this was rocky because she wouldn't give me any exact day or anything, just that she would probably come home. She wouldn't tell me when in case something happened and she had to back out, so she wouldn't upset me.) I told her I would rather take her out to dinner one night and see her again the next weekend at home. That way, we didn't have to put so much pressure on texting or calling since the first week didn't go so well. She told me, ""I don't think that's a good idea."" She wouldn't tell me why. Of course, this was very frustrating to me, but I tried to keep my cool. We went to lunch, and things were sort of ok, but we were both very emotional after this whole week. After lunch and some more talking about the situation, she told me to take her back to her dorm; she needed time to herself. I asked her, ""Are you way too upset to look at me?"" She responded, ""Yes."" After an hour, she texted me, ""I don't think I can hang out the rest of the day, but I need to talk to you before you leave."" My heart sank. I texted, ""Are we done? Is that the talk? If that's the talk, I would rather do it now, and I can leave."" She texted me saying, ""Yes, it is. I'm so sorry."" I couldn't believe it. I stood there begging her to just give it some time so we could both adjust to this new space. She wasn't having it. When I met her outside her dorm building, I kept begging her to give it time. She said she was done with the cycle of hurting each other. It was clear that she didn't want to break up with me, and that this was a decision she came to within the time we were apart that day, so about an hour. She struggled to let me touch her. Halfway through this moment, I sort of woke up and realized what was happening. She told me she loved me. She said she still wanted contact and to be friends. I had asked her if we would ever see each other again, and she said she wanted to. I asked what happens if these few weeks go by, and she changes her mind, and she hinted at a maybe. I asked her if we would ever reconnect, and she said, ""I think we will find our way back to each other."" I told her I would wait however long she needed. She asked me if I was mad at her. I told her no and that I understood why she was doing that. This whole interaction was maybe around 5 minutes. I think we both know that if we had been longer, she would have ended up changing her mind. I think she made the right decision. After we left each other, I texted her saying how much I loved her, how I would wait until we could reconnect. How I told her I know our story together isn't over. I told her if what she needed from me right now is to love her from afar, then that is what I will do. She replied, ""Thank you."" I responded, telling her that I loved her so much and that I would show that to her every single day. My last message to her that day was ""Please don't let this be forever."" The next two days, we didn't speak. On Tuesday, before I went to bed, I checked her location. She was still sharing it with me through Life360. I just wanted to know she was safe. At 3 am, I woke up in a panic; something felt wrong. I checked her location. She had stopped sharing it with me. I checked her TikTok page. She took down one video of us twirling around and looking at each other with love. She has kept up other videos, though. I was so confused and freaked out. I called her. I knew she wasn't going to pick up, but I did it anyway. I left a voicemail that said something like, ""Hey (her name), I think we should talk, I have a lot to talk to you about. I hope you reach out, bye."" I was sure that she would never reach out. I thought it was over. The next day, she texted me. ""Hey, I saw you had called. Feel free to text me if you still have stuff to say."" I texted her back an hour later, saying, ""Hey, thanks for reaching out. It means a lot to me. I would love to catch up over a coffee the next time you're in town. No rush, just whenever you're ready. She responded in 2 minutes and said, ""I'll let you know (my name)."" I left the message on read. I didn't know how to take that message. It's vague, but it doesn't shut the door completely. Just yesterday, I texted her again. I told her I had done a lot of reflecting on our relationship and my role in it, and I understood where I fell short. I told her I started to begin working on fixing these bad habits through therapy. I told her that I was sure she was going through a lot of change and probably overwhelmed, so I wasn't expecting a big reply. I said that I hope that I could show her my growth and how different things could be for us in the future, and that I was completely dedicated to becoming the person I know I can be for both of us. She responded a few hours later, saying, ""I'm glad you are investing in yourself. I'm happy for you."" I responded with, ""Thanks (her name). I'm happy that I'm doing this, too. I hope that classes and auditions went well. If you ever wanted to chat about anything, you know I'm here."" She responded with a ""thank you."" I told her, ""Anytime."" That is where we left it off. I'm really confused about this whole situation since we did not talk about the terms of the breakup. I don't know if I should try to keep reaching out or just let her come to me on her own time. She still has me up on her social media; she's in group chats that I am active in. She follows me on socials. She likes my TikTok reposts that are somewhat aimed at her. She reposted a TikTok that hinted at the connection not being over. I still get the notifications of her viewing my TikTok profile, so I know she is trying to see my reposts. But she isn't talking to me. We used to never get enough of each other. Why won't she text me now? One of the things that made me fall in love with her was how sure she was. She knows what she wants, and she goes for it. She's incredibly in tune with her emotions. Why is now so different? I really want this connection to work out. She is the only person I was able to see a future with. We were looking at engagement rings just two weeks ago. I know she loves me, so why can't we work this out? I understand where in the relationship I could have improved, and I am ready to make these changes. I just wish she would tell me if this is something she wants to do. If I were given another chance, I know I would take things slower. I take her on casual dates, no labels, and in a few months, we could have a conversation about where we see this going. I know that I would be okay if we officially ended and never got back together. I know I'm capable of loving other people, and letting other people love me, but if you love someone deep in your bones, why would you stop fighting? I'm not sure how to rebuild with her. Any advice?

  
TLDR: Partner of 2 and a half years dumped me first week into college after a series of miscommunications. It's been 1 week since the breakup and I'm ready to reconcile and start fresh, but I have no idea where her head is at. How do I go about fixing this? ",1,1757262649.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1naxr68,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1naxr68/is_my_dad_in_an_emotionally_abusive_relationship/,Is my Dad in an emotionally abusive relationship or he is just an asshole?,"Hi, my friend suggested I post here for some advice because I don‚Äôt know where to look/who to go to. Apologies for any spelling errors or grammar mistakes. It‚Äôs hard writing this down for the first time.

To start with, I‚Äôm worried that my father has been emotionally abused by his wife for years. My parents haven‚Äôt been together since I was a young kid and my father remarried when I was 15. I‚Äôve three siblings and out of us all I am the last one to still be in contact with him, albeit very irregularly. We met last week for the first time since February and it did not go well.

Ugh, here is where I have to try to condense years of issues into a bitesize chunk for this post which is no easy feat but here I go. Thanks for staying with me so far.

Ten years ago I‚Äôm living abroad. I‚Äôm home for the week and my whole family is flying back with me for a family wedding. My Dad wants to drop me to the airport to use my suitcase for his wedding gift. Sadly, his wife‚Äôs brother died a few months before this so she‚Äôs been sad and quite low awhile. Because of this she wants to sleep in so Dad wants to get us to the airport 30/45 minutes before our flight. This is not okay with me because I don‚Äôt want to miss our flight to my cousin's wedding. I never give out or challenge my Dad but I did here. It was the first time I ever gave out to him whilst trying to explain I was empathetic to his wife‚Äôs sadness but I wanted to be on time for my flight. It was ridiculous. He compromised and promised to pick me up around an hour and half before the flight. When he arrived, no sign of the wife. He‚Äôs angry and when he drives he doesn‚Äôt go in the direction of the airport, he is driving to his house to pick up his wife. I say nothing‚Ä¶

We pick her up, it‚Äôs tense AF. When she gets in my Dad turns to me as I‚Äôm in the back and says ‚Äòanything you have to say for yourself‚Äô? I honestly don‚Äôt and say so..

His wife turns to him and says, ‚Äòlet's not do this in the car.‚Äô My brother is beside me and we‚Äôre both eyeing each other, thinking what the f is going on? We get to the airport, there‚Äôs about an hour and fifteen minutes before our flight and Dad stops me at the airport parking and wants me to apologise to his wife immediately. She storms off so I can‚Äôt, and I‚Äôm not sure what for? We rush through the airport to get to security. I get through and am delighted to see my sisters are close behind me, smile and wave. I am quickly physically dragged away by my Dad. He drags me to his wife and demands I apologise to her. I‚Äôm baffled, truly and say ‚Äòwhat for?‚Äô or something.

It has something to do with me wanting to get to the airport on time. I never spoke to his wife about it so I didn‚Äôt understand why I had to apologise to her. Lets also put it this way. We were never close, me and his wife. She was a very hostile person, the opposite of kind, none of us ever had a relationship with her and kinda dreaded seeing her. My siblings are the kind of nice people you‚Äôd want to be your friends and we never before this ‚Äòevent‚Äô talked bad about this women to even each other. We silently all dealt with the awkwardness alone. 	

I said I was really sorry my Dad‚Äôs wife lost her brother. I said something along the lines of¬† me wanting to get to the airport on time wasn‚Äôt me trying to be unreasonable or insensitive to her. I said we weren‚Äôt even told of his loss until weeks or even months after it happened so we weren‚Äôt sure how she was about it. I gave her a hug and asked could we put everything behind us and have a lovely weekend together at my cousin‚Äôs wedding. My siblings get through security, seem concerned and ask if everything is okay. I say yeah it‚Äôs cool and we ask Dad and the wife to get coffee with us before the flight. They decide to do their own thing. We get coffee and we‚Äôre back at the gate, there‚Äôs me, my three siblings, two in laws and Dad and his wife. Nobody except me and one sister are next to each other. Everyone is doing their own things. One sister has her headphones on and is eating something. My brother is listening to something too. My in-laws are also doing their own thing. Me and another sister go to the bathroom together. We come back and there‚Äôs shouting, Dad and his wife and playing tug‚Äôo‚Äôwar with his car keys. My sister and I are looking at each other, like wtf is going on? Dad‚Äôs wife storms off with the keys. My Dad‚Äôs left looking dumbfounded. My sister goes up to him to ask what‚Äôs going on?

The wife was feeling left out and didn‚Äôt want to come if the whole weekend was going to be like this. Dad decided to be alone then. Myself, the siblings and in-laws are so sick of the pandering we all can‚Äôt understand how she felt left out as we weren‚Äôt even talking to each other!¬†

This event seems to have been the catalyst for his wife separating my Dad completely from his four children and his sister. All of us being the only family he has besides his wife.

After the airport incident the following happened‚Ä¶

* I was still living in the UK but my siblings were made go to coffee in only public places to apologise to my Dad‚Äôs wife for leaving her out. Which they did so to make peace. This happened more than once and they weren‚Äôt allowed back to my Dad‚Äôs house.
* We were all read out letters in individual meetings with our father to hear everything about how we hurt his feelings through the years.
* In regards to the above his did this in order of age so my two older sisters were first. Shortly after their letter readings out, our mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. They rang our Dad to explain and because of the sad news and asked him to please not meet me and my brother and read us out letters about all of our flaws. He promised he wouldn‚Äôt and proceeded to arrange meeting me and my brother to do the same.
* His sister got a lot of the brunt of the blame for some reason even though she lived in another country. It was her daughter‚Äôs wedding and Dad and his wife say that she poisoned me against them‚Ä¶Not true at all. Just in their case everyone else is wrong and the problem.
* His sister also had cancer and they rang her the night before her surgery to tell her what an awful person she was. (I am not making this up) Thankfully both my Mum and Auntie are fine and cancer free. Woohoo.¬†
* There has been four grandchildren in the last 10 years. My Dad has met two of them. His wife had to be there.¬†
* A sibling was diagnosed with a horrible condition and that wasn‚Äôt enough to wake him up and he didn‚Äôt reach out to her to ask her how she was after the diagnosis‚Ä¶
* He won‚Äôt meet my child as I don‚Äôt want to see her and I won‚Äôt compromise.

Whenever I‚Äôve met him in the last couple of years there has been a rehearsed script of what he wants to say to me. He‚Äôs gotten too painful to continue meeting him. I am worried he is being controlled to do the above actions. His wife is a counseller and it‚Äôs like she using her tools on my Dad in a really f\*cked up way? When I met Dad last week he had a notebook and scripted questions he wanted to ask me. He was asking me why has our relationship been strained the last 10 years and I tried to explain everything that has happened in 10 years‚Ä¶ It turns out they are still angry about how I was that day at the airport. 10 YEARS AGO!

Am I crazy thinking she‚Äôs emotionally abusive? Is my Dad just an asshole? I recently decided to report it as a safeguarding issue as my father is retired and nearly 70. I‚Äôm also worried about his memory. As I‚Äôm not allowed to see him much, it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt do anything else. Is there anything else I can do? Am I missing telling you guys anything? There‚Äôs so much more to say but the airport is where it all began and the bullet points are the worst consequences since the event. Sorry if this seems dramatic to some people. It‚Äôs really been horrible losing my father in this way. He was really the best guy before all of this crap.¬†

1naxpo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1naxpo6/should_the_best_singleserve_coffee_maker_keurig/,Should the best single-serve coffee maker Keurig K-Supreme be your next brew upgrade,"Using the Keurig K-Supreme in my kitchen was both a treat and an exercise in fine-tuning the perfect coffee experience. This sleek and modern coffee maker is designed not only to look great on the counter but to deliver a variety of brews to suit any coffee lover's preferences. I‚Äôve been testing it daily for weeks and have brewed everything from classic coffees to iced cups to really stretch its capabilities.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right away, the Keurig K-Supreme stands out with its matte black finish and space-conscious design. It's neither too bulky nor overly compact‚Äîit fits snugly on my crowded kitchen counter, sharing space with my toaster and air fryer. The standout feature here is the 66 oz. dual-position water reservoir. Its adjustability makes it incredibly convenient for accommodating tight corners or open counter setups. I also appreciated the removable tank, which simplified refilling. From a purely aesthetic perspective, the machine‚Äôs buttons and modern style earned plenty of compliments from guests.

**Performance and MultiStream Technology**  
The true magic of this coffee maker lies in the MultiStream Technology. This innovation evenly saturates the coffee grounds in K-Cup pods to extract maximum flavor and aroma. Compared to my old single-serve brewer‚Äîwhere coffee sometimes tasted slightly watered down‚Äîthe difference here was profound. With every brew, the flavors felt fuller and the aroma more pronounced. I tested different brands of K-Cups, including premium and budget ones, to ensure consistency, and the results were impressive across the board.  

[Check Keurig K-Supreme price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0892tw82k/)

**Positives**  
One of the best aspects of this machine is its versatility when it comes to size and strength preferences. Whether I felt like a quick 6 oz. energy boost or a long, soothing 12 oz. cup, the Keurig K-Supreme delivered effortlessly with its multiple brew size options. The ""Strong"" button is a game-changer too‚Äîit produced noticeably richer coffee when I wanted something bolder.  
- The fast brewing system means I could whip up a cup of coffee in under two minutes.  
- Its user-friendly button controls make it easy for just about anyone to operate, even my tech-challenged uncle nailed it on the first go.  
- Travel mug compatibility was a blessing for the days I had to grab my coffee on the run.

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
That said, not everything about it was perfect. No product is without its quirks, and the Keurig K-Supreme isn‚Äôt an exception.  
- It lacks a milk frother, so those who love milky lattes will still need a separate device.  
- Cleaning can occasionally feel cumbersome due to the detailed maintenance alerts that remind you to descale after every 250 brews. While helpful for upkeep, it adds an extra task to your to-do list.  
- Although it accommodates reusable coffee filters, it's optimized for K-Cups, meaning ground coffee lovers must adjust their expectations slightly in terms of flavor control.

**Target Audience and Customization**  
This machine shines brightest for those who value convenience over deep coffee customization. If you‚Äôre someone who relies on a quick cup before dashing off to work, its speed and ease-of-use are unbeatable. For iced coffee fans, the ‚Äúover ice‚Äù feature works like a charm. I made several iced coffees during my testing, and the temperature held just right without diluting the taste. My roommate, who prefers tea, also loved experimenting with the K-Cup varieties available for brewing tea. Customization options‚Äîlike brew strength and size‚Äînudged the experience closer to that of a real caf√© setup.

**Competing Products**  
I‚Äôve owned a Nespresso Vertuo before, and the main difference boils down to size versatility and pod options. While the Nespresso leans heavily into crafting ‚Äúartisanal style‚Äù drinks, the Keurig feels more versatile because it supports hundreds of K-Cup varieties, including cheaper third-party options. Though lacking a frother, I found Keurig‚Äôs brewing speed a notch faster than most Nespresso models. The Ninja Coffee Maker, on the other hand, offers more flexibility for coffee enthusiasts who prefer grinding their beans. However, its bulkier design and steeper learning curve make the Keurig a better fit for compact kitchens and casual drinkers.

**Affordable Quality**  
When weighing the features this machine offers against its cost, it presents solid cost-effectiveness. I‚Äôve tested more niche or premium coffee makers, and while they offer elevated performance, none struck the balance of affordability and practicality like the Keurig K-Supreme. Its minimalist approach added to the simplicity while ensuring value for daily coffee drinkers. Instead of repeatedly pulling out a French Press or fiddling with pour-over techniques, this does the heavy lifting with one button press‚Äîan attractive trait for busy lifestyles.

The workflow has been a great step up from my DF64 Gen 2 - quieter, more tactile, etc. and I love the auto-off feature.



Unfortunately, I haven't been getting great espresso with it - the shots reminded my of those I got with the DF64 before manually aligning the burrs (which were wildly misaligned). So I took off the adjustment dial and immediately noticed eccentricity in the lower burr, which looked like it was wobbling rather than spinning. After taking out the upper and lower burrs, as you can see in the video, it appears that the burr drive shaft is either mounted at an angle or is bent.

  
I'm sure Option-O will make it right, but just wanted to share my frustrations and see if anyone has had a similar problem or if I just got unlucky. I'm most annoyed that I already sold the DF64 and this is definitely not something I can fix myself, so I'll be drinking bad coffee and/or hand-grinding for the foreseeable future.

1983, photographer unknown, presumed dead.

2- Stirling City
One of two recovered photographs from the Stirling City Library blaze. Notable for being taken the day which fourteen children vanished and for what is referred to as ""The Slender Man"". Deformities cited as film defects by officials. Fire at library occurred one week later. Actual photograph confiscated as evidence.

1986, photographer: Mary Thomas, missing since June 13th, 1986.

3- Retribution

4- The Wilks Estate
1994: Wilks Estate. One subject reported nothing out of the ordinary before taking photograph. Lower stairs area was said to be very dark. Subject states that after the camera flash she heard a sound like a watermelon being *unable to understand subject*.

5/25/93**

Subject unable to recall events after manor power failure. Unable to question other two identified subjects. Camera and film acquired from Gloria Cready, current resident of Woodview Mental Hospital and Psychological Rehabilitation Clinic. Film mostly uncontaminated despite mass of blood and human tissue present on camera. No positive ID on anomalous tall and slender subject. Facial blur caused by possible contamination.

6/7/93**

Early digital analysis indicates tall subject may have no eyes. Anomalies, previously thought to be film errors and flash artifacts, now thought to be appendages.

6/10/93**

Final identified subject reported missing along with other thirty-three patients and staff of Woodview Mental Hospital and Psychological Rehabilitation Clinic south wing.

6/18/93**

Further inquiry to cease immediately.
(see report No.3339-2)

5- Steinmen Woods
Both subjects were hunting in the Steinmen woods four hours before sundown. Surviving subject states that while hunting both men grew uneasy as fog levels rapidly increased. A constant murmuring sound accompanied by a low hum eventually became apparent to the two men an hour after the fog increased. An object falling out of tree stuck one of the men in the left shoulder causing him to discharge his weapon. Object said to be the body of a man of unknown age. It was very precisely dissected, with major internal organs still contained within the rib cage in what looked to be clear bags. Surviving subject placed organ bag within backpack. Attack followed several minutes later after a ""low children's laugh, like a giggle"". Surviving subject ran until he reached his vehicle. Subject then drove to assumed safety.

Backpack destroyed.
Surviving subject is classified as a B7 witness. B7 witness to be placed in quarantine ""Blind Box"" until resolution

6- Steinmen Woods Recon
2007:Investigation team discovered twenty-two bodies of both genders and various ages impaled on broken tree branches in a radiating circle pattern with chest mutilation as often noted with Slender Man. Upon confirmation, lead investigator ********* called for an immediate evacuation of investigation team at 1700 hours. Bodies first discovered at 1100 hours. Deadline for safe evacuation of team with only viewed physical evidence of Slender Man approximately 1730. Lost contact of team at 1725. Safety procedures fell well within established protocols. Reason for abnormality is unknown. Second team recovered camera equipment one week later. Slender Man safety procedures require this incident's physical photographic evidence to be disposed of by no later than 10/20.

I honestly don't get what half this shit means. I'm done with this Slender Man stuff. It's starting to make me uneasy. It's like reading the GBS ghost story threads before I go to bed. Why do I have to look at this stuff while it's super late?

Wiped clean, it's all gone again. This is how I live and this is how I survive. I must've hit a damn A7 Witness rating again...or lower, but if I'd been any lower my body would have been flayed into more sheets than the bible has pages. Not that I've even opened one for years to check the page count. No god would create that, shit, maybe it is a god, I don't know.

All I know is that it is there. I know it as a concept, as a horror, as extinction, that...what ever it is. Even this is enough to condemn one to death and the more I know of it, the more surely and swiftly that death will come to me. This is why I was wiped, the memories of anything relating to that being in detail was wrenched from my memory along with anything else in the near vicinity. As of the time I woke up I've discovered that I'm female, toast is my favorite food, and blue is my favorite fucking color. Was it before? Not too sure, but it is now.

I can also still taste it.

Or them.

Whatever.

I still have the barest, most minute perception of it, C3 Witness at the very least.

For us it starts with a sort of pressure in your mind. You get those shivers while walking through the woods or up a dark staircase at night without even trying to scare yourself. Every now and then a feeling of, ""Is that prick over there with the Sunday paper and cold cup of coffee staring at me every time I turn back around from him?"" when there's a complete lack of pricks with a sports page and stale mug of shit coffee there to give you that excuse. They bring you in and start throwing words at you, words and endless pictures: Black, long, child, darkness, father, pain, belt, chain, tree, ecstasy, annihilation, castration, man, blindness, pipe, net, death. the pressure in your mind starts to take form with the conclusion of each reel. When you start the program, you don't sleep, or drink, or eat 'cause the needles and tubes coming out of your arms and neck takes care of that, no problem.

Someone will come in and show you a picture. At first it's always hard to make out. It's always some kids playin' or a street at night, with a sort of dark shapeless...thing...hanging out in the shadows. Blue Testers never say anything. They let you stare at the photo for about five minutes and out the door they go. Red Testers are the same; they never talk, and you will never, ever see the same one twice before a wipe session. Reds' pictures are a little more defined and the first time you make S out and your mind can taste it, you want to vomit all over the photo...but you can't...because you vomit all over the window separating you from the Tester instead. After each puke session Fred comes in. It's always Fred, that is the one constant. He waltzes in like he's the king of the whole goddamn facility and gives you that stern look, like that of a father who just found out his child pissed their bed. Back up go those ridiculous sunglasses and out comes the mop and towel for cleaning the vomit off the window so the Green Testers can question you. I've seen Fred in the cafeteria before when they take me through the facility. He's always looking morose as shit and sitting there at that table by the vending machine. Probably scoping out the kinds of food on his tray and surmising that it's going to end up swirling around his mop bucket before too much longer.

I'm the empress though, this whole hollowed out of the ground fortress kingdom is mine, with all of its beige numbness and staccato echoes of worried haste in the hallways. Fred is mine, the testers are mine, and I am always, always in residence. Let my court sit separated in their royal quarters. They are unable to whisper to each other or co-conspire in opposition to the crown. It's not me they have to fear, but the unholy providence of that which has entitled me to my claim. Let that smug bastard have whatever satisfaction he gets wiping corn niblets off my chin.

The Greens want to know the feel of SM, but it's more like a taste. Like your goddamn brain grew a tongue and is licking a revolting reality covering film. The Greens just shrug it off as SM's synaptic psychic resonance image attributes. But that bullshit denies my experience; it denies the absolute absurdity and filthiness of sensing the SM's actual existence. It rolls around in your skull, a quiet marble of frozen and exacting intent. Calculating and cold it twists every memory it comes into contact with.

This makes you much easier to find.

They all taste different. I don't know if it's the same Slender Man in each incident or a separate Slender Man each time. Nobody is quite sure since It's never able to keep it's appearance straight for very long. In the distance - a little shadow, fog, maybe a bit dark - looks like a business exec got lost in the woods on his way home from the office. Passing side-long glance at close range, some pretty tall dude is probably going to get his suit dirtied eviscerating that soldier. Stare directly at it for a while and you wouldn't know where the dismembered corpse begins and its body ends if not for the black and white of its body. Its blank face pleads with you, trying to coax out of your perception a human-like expression. Eyes and teeth and mouths, and stuff that doesn't even belong on a face, fights over your comprehension? Just trying to get a hold of where Slender Man's tendrils are at any moment is an exercise in nausea and splitting headaches. Like meaty black smoke in a stale bar room with just a child's whisper of air to prompt it in any given direction, It'll move towards you...

and around you...

and then into you...

Long time following this subreddit, and I think soon it will be my time to take a plunge into to espresso pull :D

I love espresso and have been a consistent drinker for years now.

I've recently moved to Germany and my new work place has a great setup with La Marzocco commercial machines, Mahlk√∂nig ek43s and alongside, a great roaster providing coffee.

This has reminded me of how good espresso can be, and makes me want to upgrade from my current Lavazza Pod Machine to a proper setup.

My partner and I have grown drinking Italian/Portuguese style darker roasts and this is my preference. That said we did try a hand full of medium roasts that makes us want to start trying them out more often as well.

We may want to have a milk based drink once in a while or at some point in the future we may experiment with other forms of coffee, but as it stands our preference is indeed those lower acidity, thick body, chocolatey espresso single/double shots.

Regarding the budget for both machines. I'm quite flexible on it. I was thinking that for about ‚Ç¨1500 I should be able to get a pretty decent first setup, but I may be willing to invest a bit more if something is really worth the difference to me.

\-----------------------------

Now, here is the bit where we really would appreciate your input, the Coffee Machine and the Grinder + Burrs.

**Coffee Machine**

As it stand when it comes to the coffee machine I believe I have found the one that fits my use case the best, [the QuickMill Pop Up!](https://www.quickmill.it/en/products/quick-mill-group/pop-up/)

It seems to perform really well, its well built, has plenty of really good features, including flow control, is from a well established and well known brand that should be able to supply parts for years to come. Although a bit unknown when compared to the Lelit Victoria or the Profitec Go, I've seen this machine being recommended in a few places as the one to have.

I can get it Germany for about ‚Ç¨800-‚Ç¨900, which I believe to be a reasonable price, and a price I find acceptable for a coffee machine.

While I'm pretty set on it, all input and suggestions/comments are welcome!

**Grinder + Burrs**

When it comes to the grinder is where I really need help, as its not as clear what may be the better fit for our needs.

I also understand that this is the most important piece of the setup and one that I may need to experiment with to find the one that fits my needs the best and I also need to be comfortable with the risk that I may not like the shots I can pull from whatever Burrs and/or grinder I get.

As mentioned, darker roast espresso shots is where the grinder and burrs need to excel at first and foremost. But the ability to dabble in medium roasts is appreciated.

I prefer to have a set of burrs really suited to this and then buy a second set for lighter roasts or to eventually try to get into other forms of coffee. I also have no problems with the idea of buying a grinder and a set of burrs upfront like some SSPs (e.g. DF64 Gen 2 + SSP HUs).

As a reference, I see that I can buy a set of SSPs for about \~‚Ç¨200.

Here are the ones that I've seen that seem to be a good fit:

|Brand|Grinder + Burrs|Cost \*|Notes|

|MiiCoffee/Turin|[DF64 Gen 2 w/Standard Burrs](https://miicoffee.shop/products/mii-df64-single-dosing-coffee-grinder)|\~‚Ç¨450|Seems to be a staple in the espresso community at the moment, especially good value when upgraded with SSP burrs|

|MiiCoffee/Turin|[CF64V w/Standard Burrs](https://miicoffee.shop/products/miicoffee-cf64v-variable-speed-single-dose-coffee-grinder)|\~‚Ç¨500|Really new on the market, .... Distinct look ... but seems the horizontal layout + auger and the variable speed it looks to be, from the specs standpoint, a better DF64 Gen 2 for a similar price.|
|MiiCoffee/Turin|[DF83V w/Standard Burrs](https://miicoffee.shop/products/miicoffee-df83v-single-dose-coffee-grinder)|\~‚Ç¨800|An older model but it seems to be well liked.|
|Timemore|[Sculptor 064S w/Standard Burrs](https://timemoreeu.com/collections/the-grinder/products/timemore-electric-coffee-grinder-sculptor)|\~‚Ç¨550|I see that when compared to the DF64 Gen 2 on standard burrs it tends to edge it out.|
|Mazzer|[Phillos w/Standard Burrs](https://www.mazzer.com/en/product/philos/)|\~‚Ç¨1100|I'm not sure I should be considering this one. From what I've seen it seems to be a great grinder, it seems to fit may needs, I may be able to justify the cost. But when taking a step back, not sure I should be spending this much on my first grinder.|

\* - I usually can get better pricing from local resellers than direct from the manufacturer.

I've heard that, and don't quote me on this one, the Eureka Cone grinders are generally, really good with darker roasts, but are not that versatile or that great of a value proposition. But that a nice flat burr grinder with a nice set of burrs delivers on what the Eureka grinders do and add versatility. Please add your insights here as well!

I would really appreciate any recommendations for grinder + burr combinations that you believe may fit the profile of what I'm looking for. The table I created is just from the research I did, but feel free to suggest some even if not in the table.

Thank you for the help!

TL;DR: We love darker roast espresso, maybe we would like to experiment a bit with medium roasts too. We are set on the espresso machine for the most Part. What grinder + burrs do you recommend for our first setup.

  
Edit: Since I much more likely to have to tinker with the grinder and burrs, and these are the ones I will likely feel more tempted to upgrade in the long run, I'm not as worried about the longevity and durability here.",1,1757261830.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

[**My [25f] boyfriend [26m] of 10 months is best friends with his ex [20s?f]. She refuses to meet me and it's getting weird**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mql7n/my_25f_boyfriend_26m_of_10_months_is_best_friends/)

I started dating my boyfriend, Jeff, 10 months ago. This relationship has been amazing so far and I definitely see a future with him. There's just one problem: he has a weird relationship with his ex that's starting to make me really uncomfortable and suspicious.

When we started dating, he often talked about his best friend, Jenna, who he also owns a business with. He made it pretty clear that she was an important person to him. I knew they had spent vacations together and he mentioned hanging out with her parents a few times, too.

A few weeks after I met him, I creeped through all his pictures on facebook (because who doesn't do that with someone they just started dating?) and saw a bunch of very couple-y pictures of him and Jenna. I also found her instagram and looked through it, and it's FILLED with pictures of Jeff. A bunch of them had the hashtag #relationshipgoals and other similar things. So in this way, I figured out that they had dated. I kept waiting for him to tell me that himself, but he never did. About two months after we started dating, I straight-up asked him if he had dated her, and he admitted it.

He said that they had met in school and had similar ideals and ambitions. They dated for 9 months and broke up a year and a half ago. I asked him why they'd broken up, and he said their relationship was awful and they worked much better as friends. They started their business after they broke up and things have, apparently, been going well between them since then.

I started to get kind of suspicious about her, though, when time passed and I still hadn't met her. I met his friends and family pretty soon after we started dating, but I didn't meet Jenna. I went to numerous social events that I'd expect her to be at, but she was never there. There were a number of occasions when our paths ALMOST crossed and I really thought I was going to meet her, but I never did. For example, I went to their office a few times to meet Jeff after work, and Jenna was already gone. Or sometimes I'd come to meet him and he'd come outside to meet me so I wouldn't have to go inside.

Things started to get REALLY weird about three months ago. Jeff and Jenna were having an open house night one evening. Jeff came over to my place after work and we had a few hours to kill before it was time to go, so we went out for dinner and then walked to the office. I was kind of expecting that I'd come in and help them set up, but when we were a block away, he started asking me if I had lots of work to do and saying there was a really nice coffee shop nearby. He actually walked me to the coffee shop and sat me down, then left to go get ready with Jenna. He told me to come to the office in an hour and a half.

About half an hour before I left for the office, I texted Jeff and said I hoped everything was going well and asked if there was anything I could do. He replied and said, ""Something's come up for Jenna and she can't be here tonight.""

I was getting really suspicious at this point. I went to the office half an hour later and sure enough, Jenna wasn't there. People kept asking about her ALL night and Jeff told them she'd had a family emergency.

When we walked back to the car later that night, he told me what happened. While he and Jenna were getting ready, she had had a panic attack and said she was scared to meet me. She said she wouldn't be able to handle it and either had to leave, or he had to tell me not to come. He told her to leave, so she did.

Since then, a couple more weird things have happened, and I still haven't met Jenna. Once, when I was hanging out with Jeff, we went to the office so he could grab something. When we were almost there, he looked at his phone and said, ""Jenna's still there. Let's just go for a walk."" So we walked around the block for half an hour and then came back when she was gone.

After that happened, I told Jeff I felt really uncomfortable with the situation. I could respect that they were friends who had dated, but the way she was acting about me was very suspicious. He apologized and said he had actually been really mad at her, but wasn't sure what to do. He also told me a couple other weird stories about things she'd done. He went to a party a few weeks ago (I didn't go) and his phone had died that night. When he got home and charged his phone, it was full of texts from Jenna saying she was outside in her car and asking if I was there or not. She actually never even ended up going to the party, simply because SHE DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS THERE OR NOT.

Now here's the kicker: Jeff and Jenna are currently on a two-week-long camping trip. They've been planning this trip since before I met him, but considering the way she's behaved, I feel very uncomfortable about him being on this trip. I just looked at her instagram and she's posted five new pictures of him. As awesome as Jeff is, I'm really fed up with this and I'm seriously considering breaking things off when he gets back. Am I being unreasonable?

**tl;dr:** My boyfriend is best friends/business partners with his ex. She has done a number of weird things to avoid meeting me and I'm so sick of it that I'm considering breaking up with him.

>You're not being unreasonable at all, and I can understand why you feel so upset about the whole situation. If I were you, I'd be asking Jeff a few questions: does he know the root issue of why she doesn't want to meet you? Is she like this with anyone else?

>Explain to him that the situation is upsetting you and that you aren't comfortable with him going on a two week vacation with her. She is, afterall, his ex girlfriend and the whole thing strikes me as a little strange. Maybe you could talk about meeting Jenna with Jeff present in a quieter, mutual place like a cafe or a restuarant.

He goes on this trip with her after this conversation, well....it will just be another example of him putting her above you. Maybe he likes the attention he gets from her? You know this is shady, stop tolerating it.

>Edit: Even if he turns around and starts talking about the money and planning that he's already put into it, so what? I actually expect that response. It doesn't change the fact that he's going on a camping trip for two weeks with an ex, who freaks out about a new gf, a new gf who was never invited on the trip. Whatever planning he has put into it, doesn't change the fact that it's inappropriate. I don't know how you handled even hearing that bs, to be honest. You've been way more patient about this than I would be. If you stay with him, you tell yourself and him (and you stick with it) that it will be a cold day in hell before you ever wait in a coffee shop or do anything like that for her again, and he doesn't even need to ask you and waste his breathe . He goes on that camping trip though, girl if it was me, there wouldn't be a gf to come back to.

# **Final Update - 1 year, 3 months later**

[**Update: My [25f] boyfriend [26m] of 10 months is best friends with his ex [20s?f]. She refuses to meet me and it's getting weird**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9mv737/update_my_25f_boyfriend_26m_of_10_months_is_best/) 

I wrote my previous post over a year ago, and a lot has happened since then. I wanted to give everyone an update, since the advice on this sub was really helpful at the time.

For a few months after I wrote my OP, nothing much happened. Jeff and I continued dating, and he continued being friends/partners with Jenna. I never met her, but everything else in our relationship seemed to be going so well that I decided I'd try to deal with it.

Things got really hard, however, when I had to take a work contract 12 hours away from home for three months. I hardly saw Jeff the whole time, and I looked at Jenna's instagram almost every day to see if she'd posted more photos of them together. More often than not, she had. Since I wasn't physically present, I felt like Jenna was his real girlfriend. I felt completely worthless and constantly stressed out, knowing my boyfriend was spending all his time with another woman who I already had suspicions about.

While I was away for work, I decided to break up with Jeff. I broke up with as soon as I came back, and I made it very clear that his relationship with Jenna was intolerable for me. I told him he was going to have a hard time dating anyone who wasn't her as long as she was still in his life. He kept saying he didn't understand why it was such a problem. He told me he couldn't control her behaviour, but he promised me he hadn't cheated on me. I explained to him that by allowing their friendship to continue, he was condoning her behaviour. I told him I didn't really even care if he'd physically cheated or not, since he'd already shown disrespect for me and our relationship.

I didn't speak to him for a few months and I went on with my life. I took another contract out of town and even considered moving permanently to another city. One night, though, Jeff called me and apologized. He said he had been thinking about our relationship a lot and realized he had been in the wrong. He said his relationship with Jenna was beginning to feel toxic to him, and he'd made arrangements to dissolve their business partnership. After that, I decided to meet up with him (not necessarily give him another chance) and discuss the situation further. When we met up, he promised to stop talking to Jenna and unfollowed her on all social media.

As of now, he has not spoken to her in six months, and we've gotten back together. We actually ran into her at a concert a few weeks ago, and they didn't even say hi to each other. I feel much more respected and confident in my relationship now.

TLDR: I broke up with my boyfriend. He ended his friendship/partnership with his ex and we have gotten back together.

>Hey OP, not to stir the pot, but it really sounds like your boyfriend was dating Jenna and they broke up.
>
>**u/TacoPenisMan**
>>While that does fit the timeline, it‚Äôs not the only possibility. He could have been in denial about the toxic relationship and finally seen enough evidence - including missing OP. People are slow to realize how dumb they are or how bad a shitty friend is, sometimes.

>Can't believe you never ended up meeting her! I'd be very curious to hear her side of things...

>**u/atomiclithium**
>>Absolutely. I would have reached out to her before reinstating the relationship. If they still haven't met yet, and if Jenna was still dodgy... maybe I'm reading into it too much

>Tbh, it kinda sounds like he and the girl were dating, broke up and then he reached back out to OP...I mean, he didn‚Äôt fight for OP at all when she ended it, probably because he had the other girl.

>**u/stophittingthyself**
>>>he didn't fight for OP at all
>>
>>Exactly. His decision to end things with Jenna wasnt made out of respect to OP. He openly admits that he broke things off with Jenna because things get toxic and now they're cold with each other. He could had just set normal boundaries if he decision was made for OPs sake.

>I would have only dated your ex on the condition that you had a long talk with Jenna without Jeff knowing. This whole situation reeks of infidelity and I would be more determined to find the truth than to just accept 2nd place after 1rst dropped out.

**u/[deleted]**
>Eh... I‚Äôm glad you broke up with him. I‚Äôm puzzled that you got back together. That would be a no from me- too many unanswered questions, too much anxiety and insecurity, too much history of poor prioritization. He cut Jenna off but what if they start wanting to be friends again? What if he makes a new odd friendship? For your sake, I hope he really has changed, because Jenna was never the problem here- it was Jeff. Jeff and his poor boundaries.

I am trying to dial in my shots - Mine came with two baskets the double then a big one that looks like shot glass made of steeel lol. Is that for both the quad shot and regular drip coffee?  I don't dinrk drip but do like a quad. I can just pull two but if it can make me a quad all the better. Second. I am using Lavazza Cremo y Gusta beans. They were in my Phillips fully auto 300 and I loved them, My grind sizie is suggested between a 6 and an 8. I am not getting as much Creama as I was with the phillips but it is a much deeper darker shot. The flavor is not bad ast all just the volume seems not as much as the double shot ont he phillips?

Did you learn anything interesting in the sermon? Was there a verse that stood out to you? Did a song resonate with you? Did God lay anything cool on your heart? Was there a snack at coffee hour that stole the show?

Post about it here!

If you aren't the sort to go to church, that's fine too! Feel welcome to share anything neat from your spiritual walk this past week.
