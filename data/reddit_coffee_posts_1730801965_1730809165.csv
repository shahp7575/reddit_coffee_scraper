1gk58jr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gk58jr/burger_king_parent_restaurant_brands_falls_short/,Burger King parent Restaurant Brands falls short of Q3 revenue expectations,"Restaurant Brands International on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed analysts‚Äô expectations as domestic same-store sales growth for all four of its chains fell short of Wall Street estimates.

Here‚Äôs what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 93 cents adjusted vs. 95 cents expected

Revenue: $2.29 billion vs. $2.31 billion expected

Restaurant Brands reported third-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders of $252 million, or 79 cents per share, unchanged from a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company earned 93 cents per share.

Net sales climbed 24.7% to $2.29 billion, largely thanks to the company‚Äôs acquisitions of its largest U.S. Burger King franchisee and its Popeyes business in China earlier this year.

The company‚Äôs worldwide same-store sales grew just 0.3% in the quarter. Burger King, Firehouse Subs and Popeyes all reported same-store sales declines in their home markets.

Burger King‚Äôs same-store sales fell 0.7%. The chain is in the middle of a turnaround in the U.S., but consumers are also spending less at restaurants, reigniting the value wars between Burger King and its rivals.

Popeyes reported same-store sales declines of 4%. In June, the chain launched boneless wings as a permanent menu item for the first time in its history.

Firehouse Subs saw its same-store sales shrink 4.8% in the quarter. The sandwich chain is the latest addition to Restaurant Brands‚Äô portfolio, as of 2021, and the smallest brand by footprint with just 1,300 locations as of the end of the third quarter.

Tim Hortons was the top performer, with domestic same-store sales growth of 2.3%. But the Canadian coffee chain still fell short of Wall Street‚Äôs same-store sales growth expectations of 4.1%, based on StreetAccount estimates.

Outside of the U.S. and Canada, Restaurant Brands‚Äô international same-store sales rose 1.8% in the quarter, just shy of estimates of 2.2%.

I‚Äôm a newbie on this amazing coffee community and I wish to share my experience with the new Baratza Esp Encore grinder which I bought few months back. 

Surely love the way my Espresso and French press tastes. I use a Morphy Richard‚Äôs coffee Machine, nothing fancy but as James Hoffman rightly said. The freshness of the beans and grind makes a huge difference irrespective of the machine you have. I also added an after market Bottomless Portafilter and the results are surely way better than the factory portafilter.

I dabble a lot with the grind settings and different roast needs different grind settings. Still lots to learn and discover. I use Blue Tokai coffee beans. 

This is one of my favourite espresso I pulled this weekend. Make sure you turn on the sound when you watch this video.

Have a lovely day!

Yes - lactonic lavender with hints of coffee. The reviews are true. The coffee is fleeting and you might miss it, but the scent is reminiscent of what a warm cappuccino on December night feels like. Calming, silently romantic, deeply comforting. It reminds me of the first time I held hands with my fianc√©, funnily enough, even though the notes aren't traditionally very glamorous. 

Easy on the note too. It's very migraine proof. It lasts a good 5-7 hours on me in Pune weather, perhaps lingers on more as a skin scent. 

Fair warning - with all the tension around decanters, be wary of who you buy yours from. I purchased my 30ml decant from Scentoria and have begun to only buy my decants and testers from him. The website is a GREAT repository of niche / uncommon scents. Unfortunately, the first time I tested this was from another decanter and I suspect theirs was diluted with a mixer (lasting power in comparison was ~1 hour tops, if I'm being general). I still went ahead and purchased a bigger size because this fragrance is GORGEOUS.

I tried putting both SIM cards into different devices, and they worked fine.

I also tested Globe, and it worked for a while, but eventually stopped too. Still, it works in other devices, so the issue seems to be with my phone. I contacted customer support for both carriers, as well as Xiaomi, and both said it's a phone issue, not a network problem.

I've already tried the usual troubleshooting: toggling airplane mode, switching radio power modes, restarting the phone, factory resetting, cleaning the SIM cards and trays, and reinserting them multiple times. Nothing‚Äôs worked. This all started happening about a week or two after the 1.0.13 Hyper OS update.

I‚Äôm thinking of trying one of the Xiaomi stores nearby to see if they can help with repairs or warranty claims. If that doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôll just have to wait it out and hope a future software update fixes the issue. If none of that works, I guess my only option will be to take it to a local repair shop.

This last year though I‚Äôm sitting at 62kg and barely fluctuate. I‚Äôve counted calories, i workout 3/4 times a week alongside a very active job

When you both meet for the first few times, ya'll DEFINITELY need to get separate checks. 

If a man paid for me on the first few dates, I'd get super sus and I'd take it as that he wants sex. For me, I wouldn't ever accept gifts from a boyfriend or let him pay for me. Why? I'm just a girlfriend. He has no basis to give me gifts. Legally, I'm nothing to him. So he most likely wants sex in return. If I'm his wife, I'm his life partner, and he can give me anything he wants. 

Then comes the argument : ""well, it's not that you're only a girlfriend, that means many things, and some people date for 10 years and don't marry at all"". Welp, if he hasn't proposed to me within 2 or 3 years, I'm gone. That's it. And I'm not going to shack up either. Why he'd marry me then? He gets the cow for free and harbors no legal responsibility. (In my country, if you divorce, you just get 50/50, house is typically sold and profit is split, also alimony doesn't exist, so don't tell me that I'm one of those women who want to take all in divorce) 

So, to not create weird situations or resentment when you both break up, it's best to pay for your own stuff. If it's a coffee worth like 2‚Ç¨, I'd accept if we've been on like 10 dates, but nothing above. 

This was actually the only sensible thing my mom has taught me. Or maybe it's just me who wants absolutely no confrontation in my life and want to everything very safely. ",0,1730806772.0,self,6,0.42,False

Over the summer we got a kitten for my son.  

Since I work from home, and always keep my office door open, I was the person the cat could always find when it wanted to be petted.  

I am also the first person awake in the morning, so, since I was getting my coffee I would also give the kitten fresh kibble and a little soft food on top.  While I was at it I emptied the litter box.

Now, the cat is NOT allowed in my bedroom.  In fact, no one lets the cat into their bedrooms.  The cat has free roam of most of the house.  

About a month after getting the cat, in the middle of the night, I get woken up by the sound of SPRO-OI-OINGGGG.
The cat was reaching under the bedroom door and hitting the spring.  I ended up getting up and shoving a shoe under the spring.  This worked for a little while, but the cat is growing and getting stronger, the imp can now push the shoe out from under the spring.  Last night I put a laundry basket against the shoe, but I‚Äôm not sure what I can do once the laundry is put away.

","I (25M) hope this post doesn't break rule 2, if it does I apologise but I could really use some advice.

So I've been wondering for some months now about if I actually have ADHD or not. When I first heard the description of some of the symptoms it really felt like a ""omg"" moment of realisation, like the feeling of absolute clarity and rationality I feel anytime Adrenaline and high stress situations happen, or how doing boring things sounds like the worst thing in the world and if I don't keep myself distracted by multitasking way too much or other counter measures I tend to skip them as much as possible, even when they are still important. There are a few others, but also mainly the simple feeling that I definitely never felt ""mentally typical"" and even as a middle school kid could always sense that my thought patterns weren't the same as the majority of my peers, but I kinda always summed it up at me just being weird and cooler/less boring than the average person. Heck some of my best friends in the world are definitely at least on some light spectrum of something, with one pretty much being (functioning) autistic. I also hate crowded closed spaces because I can't single out the conversations I'm having and the convos everyone else is having.

BUT, I also never really had problems focusing in school (at least for things I didn't already know or weren't considered extra boring like ancient literature) always had acceptable grades although shaky at times, and they all improved quite a lot in university where I had no rigid scheme and had much more freedom. Never had problems reading books or listening to them... and my annual book count has been increasing steadily, now the year isn't over and i'm at 11. Coffee also works just as regular coffe and does not make me sleepy at all.

Maybe It is explain better by saying that some symptoms perfectly describe feelings/situations I have had occurring for up to a decade, while others are 100% unrelated to my life.",1,1730806198.0,ADHD,5,1.0,False

It not only fuels employees throughout the day but also fosters camaraderie and enhances productivity. To create the perfect office pantry, it‚Äôs essential to curate a selection of items that cater to diverse preferences and dietary needs. Here‚Äôs a guide to the essentials every workplace should have.

# 1. Coffee and Tea Selection

# Quality Coffee

For many employees, coffee is an essential part of their daily routine. Offering high-quality coffee can make a significant difference in their workday. Consider providing a variety of coffee options, including:

* **Ground Coffee**: Offer a selection of blends (light, medium, and dark roast) to cater to different tastes.
* **Single-Serve Pods**: If you have a single-serve coffee machine, provide a range of pods, including decaf options.
* **Creamers and Sweeteners**: Include milk, non-dairy creamers, sugar, and artificial sweeteners for personalization.

# Assorted Teas

Not everyone drinks coffee, so having a diverse tea selection is vital. Offer a variety that includes:

* **Herbal Teas**: Options like chamomile or peppermint for a caffeine-free choice.
* **Green and Black Teas**: Classic options that many employees enjoy.
* **Specialty Teas**: Flavored or seasonal teas can add variety.

# 2. Healthy Snacks

# Fruits and Vegetables

Fresh produce can provide a nutritious snacking option. Stock up on:

* **Whole Fruits**: Apples, bananas, and oranges are easy to grab and eat.
* **Veggie Packs**: Pre-cut carrots, celery sticks, and cherry tomatoes can be paired with hummus or dip.

# Nuts and Seeds

Nuts and seeds are excellent sources of protein and healthy fats. Offer a variety of:

* **Mixed Nuts**: A blend of almonds, walnuts, and cashews can be both satisfying and nutritious.
* **Trail Mix**: Pre-packaged or homemade trail mix can provide a quick energy boost.

# Granola and Protein Bars

Granola and protein bars are convenient, on-the-go options that can help sustain energy levels. Look for:

* **Variety Packs**: Offering different flavors ensures there's something for everyone.
* **Nut-Free Options**: Be mindful of allergies and include nut-free bars for those with dietary restrictions.

# 3. Indulgent Treats

While healthy options are essential, it‚Äôs also important to have some indulgent treats to keep morale high. Consider including:

* **Chips and Popcorn**: Provide a selection of chips or popcorn for a crunchy snack option.
* **Cookies and Brownies**: Individually packaged or homemade treats can brighten up the workday.

# 4. Hydration Options

# Water

Staying hydrated is vital for overall health. Ensure your pantry includes:

* **Bottled Water**: Offer still and sparkling options.
* **Infused Water**: Provide fruits or herbs (like lemon or mint) for employees to infuse their water, encouraging healthy hydration.

# Alternative Beverages

In addition to water, include other beverage options, such as:

* **Sparkling Water**: A refreshing alternative to soda.
* **Juices**: 100% fruit juice can be a tasty addition to the beverage lineup.

# 5. Essential Supplies

Lastly, don‚Äôt forget the essential supplies to support pantry functionality:

* **Utensils and Plates**: Keep disposable or reusable utensils, plates, and cups on hand for convenience.
* **Napkins and Towels**: Having these available can help maintain cleanliness and organization.

# Conclusion

Curating the perfect [**office pantry**](https://ace-vending.biz/pantry/) involves a thoughtful selection of items that cater to diverse tastes and dietary needs. By providing quality coffee and tea, healthy snacks, indulgent treats, hydration options, and essential supplies, you can create a pantry that boosts morale and productivity. A well-stocked pantry not only keeps employees energized but also fosters a sense of community in the workplace, making it an invaluable resource for any organization.",1,1730805554.0,u_Sad_Lunch8508,0,1.0,False

I think the brewhead can contain about 60 grams of water right? So with 18g of coffee that's just over 1:3. I can even add a splash of water in the cup beforehand to water it down. But if I go for 1:3, what's a good brewtime? Still aim for 30 seconds? Do I preinfuse? Do I go so coarse it's only 20 seconds or less? And what about temperature? 

I enjoy medium roast. I don't like too dark and I also don't like too light. I try to get the water inside the kettle to around 90 C and the Flair to 2 lights.

Sorry I have not been around lately!  I thought everything was just fine in my little workshop on the beach. The sun was shining, the waves were crashing, and my merry elves were busy crafting gifts as they always did. But I felt like something was off. Different. I‚Äôd catch them whispering when they thought I wasn‚Äôt around, and their usual smiles seemed just a tad forced. I kept brushing it off, thinking they were just tired from the holiday rush, but a nagging little voice told me I was missing something important. Still, I chalked it up to pre-holiday jitters. Oh, how wrong I was‚Ä¶ how wrong‚Ä¶ I was üò≠. üèñÔ∏è ü¶û got a rude awakening this week!  I will tell you more about it 
tomorrow. 

Part II
Since I knew the holiday rush was getting to everyone, the next morning, I decided to check in and lift their spirits, but the moment I entered the workshop, the usual hum of happy elves working away was gone. Instead, I was met with little picket signs! ‚ÄúFair Seas, Fair Treats!‚Äù they read, and ‚ÄúBreaks for Beach Days!‚Äù My mouth dropped open. I asked Coral, my chief elf, what in the sandy depths was going on, and she hesitantly told me they were forming a union. A union! Can you believe it? They said they were overworked and didn‚Äôt have enough time to enjoy the beach they loved so much. I couldn‚Äôt believe my little elves were unhappy‚Äîwasn‚Äôt this work supposed to be a joy? My jaw dropped and knew a storm was coming and üèñÔ∏è ü¶ûwas going to get wet if she didn‚Äôt find an umbrella quick!  Man‚Ä¶ retelling this story is stressful. More tomorrow!

Part III
That day, we sat down right in the sand with a list of demands. Now, I‚Äôve faced stormy seas, but nothing prepared me for this: they wanted shorter hours, regular breaks, and comfier chairs to sit on. They told me they loved making gifts, but they were just too worn out to enjoy it anymore. I felt my shell heat up in embarrassment. I‚Äôd always thought the elves were happy because giving brought me so much joy. I couldn‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt feel the same‚Äîwasn‚Äôt that the spirit of the season? But looking at their tired faces, I started to wonder if maybe I‚Äôd missed something important.
That night, I lay awake in my sandy little nook, thinking about everything the elves had said. Could it be that I‚Äôd taken their hard work for granted? All these years, I‚Äôd been caught up in the joy of delivering gifts and spreading cheer, never stopping to consider the toll it might be taking on them. My claws felt heavy as I realized I hadn‚Äôt truly understood what it means to give. Giving, I‚Äôd always thought, was about making others happy‚Äîbut maybe, I was learning, it also means knowing when to give others a break. I knew then that things had to change.  But could I? Should I?  There was so much to ponder - I will give more deets on the morrow. 

Since I‚Äôm in town - I thought I would see who all have been good little boys and girls - and if they would like a üéÅ.

My clicks are given ***without the expectation of reciprocity***. I like to try and pay things forward anywhere I can. I used to try trading but it‚Äôs so annoying to see ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do yours if you do mine but YOU have to go first - only to be hosed by a cheater/scammer who feigns innocence). For the most part - my clicks end up going unused‚Ä¶ wasted because after being tricked so many times - I was over being fooled/scammed and feeling bitter and disappointed in my fellow crabs. So I have adopted the - I simply will do something nice because I can. Because I want to. ***Without an expectation of quid pro quo***. That takes away the feeling of being taken advantage of. 

That said - should people be in a giving spirit. That you feel inspired to be a giver - Sandy Claws always enjoys opening her game and seeing a *surprise* gift of generosity. It brings the warm fuzzies. But please - don‚Äôt ruin the surprise. If you give a gift - donate anonymously. Do it because the spirit of giving moved you - not because I did something for you first.

Sometimes she asks for favor and despite what she has done I help. Even though she hurt me I still see her as a vulnerable person in this world and I probably had some feelings for her.

But lately I have started to recover from that relationship and started to realize that she treated me like a piece of rug.

Anyway she asked me to help her change to winter wheels on her car since she needs to make a long drive and there might be ice on a road tommorow. I am definitely not doing that. I have plans for tonight and she has enough time to find someone to do it for money.

1gk4872,https://www.reddit.com/r/PensiveAI/comments/1gk4872/breaking_the_doomscrolling_cycle_5_ways_to_manage/,Breaking the Doomscrolling Cycle: 5 Ways to Manage Election Stress,"During elections, many of us feel an urge to stay constantly updated. This behavior, often called ""[doomscrolling](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-doomscrolling-5088882),"" involves the compulsive consumption of distressing news, leaving us feeling stressed and overwhelmed. Doomscrolling is¬†[often fueled](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-doomscrolling-5088882)¬†by our innate desire to prepare for potential threats during times of uncertainty. The fear that something terrible might happen without warning¬†[drives us](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-doomscrolling-5088882)¬†to continuously seek out information, believing that staying updated will help us stay safe.

[Studies show](https://www.nextavenue.org/election-stress-disorder/)¬†that during election years, people report higher stress levels as constant exposure to political tensions magnifies feelings of worry and helplessness. In¬†[recent election cycles](https://www.nextavenue.org/election-stress-disorder/), up to 68% of Americans found the political climate a significant source of stress. To combat this cycle of stress, consider these five strategies for reducing election stress and staying grounded in a healthy mindset.

https://preview.redd.it/103a1ocpe2zd1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd8521ff627db45ed3072bec02bce324ddc98d30

# 1. Limit Your Screen Time

Excessive exposure to political news can amplify negative emotions and¬†[contribute to stress](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-cope-with-stress-from-news-and-events). To mitigate this,¬†[avoid news and social media](https://www.nebraskamed.com/health/healthy-lifestyle/behavioral-health/indecision-2024-how-to-cope-with-election-anxiety)¬†for at least 30-60 minutes before bedtime to promote better sleep and reduce stress.¬†[Reducing screen time](https://www.nebraskamed.com/health/healthy-lifestyle/behavioral-health/indecision-2024-how-to-cope-with-election-anxiety)¬†during these hours also minimizes the impact on your mental and physical health. By setting designated times to catch up on news (such as during your morning coffee) - you can stay informed without becoming overwhelmed.

# 2. Practice Self-Compassion

Be kind to yourself by acknowledging your feelings without judgment. Understand that it's normal to feel stressed during such uncertain times, and many others are experiencing similar emotions.¬†[Practicing self-compassion](https://positivepsychology.com/how-to-practice-self-compassion/)¬†involves recognizing your own humanity and treating yourself with the same kindness. This approach can help reduce self-criticism and promote emotional resilience.

# 3. Prioritize Self-Care

Election-related stress can take a toll on both your mental and physical well-being. Engaging in self-care activities is essential to counteract these effects. Physical activity, such as exercise or¬†[nature walks](https://silvotherapy.co.uk/articles/the-health-benefits-of-walking-in-nature#:~:text=Studies%20have%20shown%20that%20spending,urban%20park%20during%20the%20winter.), can¬†[reduce levels of cortisol](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/exercising-to-relax#:~:text=Exercise%20reduces%20levels%20of%20the,natural%20painkillers%20and%20mood%20elevators.), the stress hormone, and transform tension into productive energy. Guided exercises like deep breathing and visualization activate the ""relaxation response,"" allowing your body to¬†[stop producing stress hormones](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322335#summary). Moreover, incorporating practices like journaling and meditation¬†[provides](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322335#summary)¬†healthy outlets to process emotions and maintain a sense of calm.

# 4. Manage your News Intake

Opt for trustworthy news outlets and be selective about what you consume. Try to¬†[limit your news intake](https://www.nebraskamed.com/health/healthy-lifestyle/behavioral-health/indecision-2024-how-to-cope-with-election-anxiety)¬†to less than an hour a day, and consider reading the news instead of watching it to control the flow of information. By setting boundaries, you can break the cycle of constantly seeking updates and¬†[reduce stress levels](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-cope-with-stress-from-news-and-events).

# 5. Reframe Your Perspective

Remember that it's okay to take a step back from the constant influx of news. Engage in positive activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Reframing stressful thoughts by focusing on your immediate surroundings or spending quality time with loved ones - can reinforce a¬†[balanced perspective](https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/memberarticles/the-power-of-reframing-and-how-to-do-it). By shifting your focus to the present moment, you can¬†[reduce stress](https://blog.caravanwellness.com/the-power-of-perspective-health-benefits-of-cognitive-reframing/)¬†and cultivate a healthier mindset.

Starting next week, it will be on Wednesdays and Thursdays.

**Length:** 8 episodes, up to 20 minutes each.

**Synopsis:** This story is based on two theories. One, that if we flirt with someone continously for 21 days, there will be a chance that that person will start to be interested back. Two, we're able to forget exes if we break up for 11 months. 

Nune likes Vicky, a customer of the coffee shop. Nune talks about Vicky to Pie (Ferin) every day, which makes Pie annoyed. So, she challenges Nune to flirt with Vicky for 21 days. Nune accepts and finds ways to flirt with Vicky. Nune also challenges Pie back to forget Vava (Great), her ex girlfriend in 21 days, becuase in 21 days it will be 11 months. Pie accepts the challenge thinking it will be easy. But, on that day, Vava appears at the coffee shop.

21 days... with hearts that just want to get closer.

So as we've been very good friends, I was with her when she was going through a rough time (her grandfather passing away), I told Ava everything and she did the same until our last year of high school when she suddenly wouldn't talk to me as much and I felt her drawing away from me. She even changed seats to be in the front of the classroom and not back where we originally sat.

As she wanted to study law I understood that she would want to study more diligently, but I was also a straight-A student so I didn't get why she would need to move up front without even telling me. With that, it all started, Ava and I stopped going to get coffee before school and going out together and even when we did it was usually me who initiated it, except when it came to going out as we only mostly went where she wanted to go. At that time she also started smoking, not saying that it's bad everyone can do what they want it's their life, their body. However, this was very out of character for Ava and didn't say anything. She reconnected with an old friend (let's call her Cece) who we both had a falling out with, they started hanging out and partying together. I said nothing because Ava said she felt guilty about the falling out.

In my country, there is a tradition of all high school graduates partying in the park together (during the day) and every graduating class had to think of a collective costume they'd all wear. It was 5 days of parties and last classes that were emotional for everyone. I would expect to spend this amazing time with my best friend but she was nowhere to be found and even when we were together it wasn't in the park but rather me helping her or going with her to the bathroom. On the last day (Friday) there was a big parade around the city and a party that lasted all night. I left the party early because I had no one to hang out with since she left me all alone. But never mind that, a few weeks after our school had a prom night for all of us graduates. We didn't speak or see each other until then. At prom, she again didn't want to hang out with me. Plot twist she was hanging out with Cece the whole time.

I had a good time regardless of her. Two days later, the important few weeks came since it was time for our national exams. I didn't contact anyone and nobody contacted me for we were all studying. Before the last exam, I asked her if she wanted to go and get some coffee to catch up. She declined and said it was exhausting and that she had to catch up on sleep. Later, when we got our results she sent me a text to ask how I did on them. So AITA for telling her of and asking her why she cares when she didn't care about me at all for the whole year?

Fun fact, a month later I cut my hair short since I was only letting it grow for my prom hairstyle. Ava also had short hair for a while now, but cut it because her ends were ruined. One of my friends followed Cece on her private account and saw them post a story of her and Ava holding my photo with short hair on Ava's phone and in the background was a song called Copy. In other words, they were implicating that I copied Ava and cut my hair short because of that when in fact I have been saying for a year and a half how I can't wait to cut it shorter and how it was driving me to the edge of insanity since I didn't have the energy to style it every day. I went a little mad after seeing the story and wrote to Ava that I was sorry for being a copycat and didn't know saying something for a year and a half and then actually doing it was considered copying rather than it was future planning. I also told her to look at herself (this part I meant for Cece as well, if you want more background about her I can write an update about that) before judging others. I wished her a good day and blocked her on every social media account.",1,1730804212.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False
1gk40tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1gk40tv/how_my_day_to_day_eating_looks_like_pcosweight/,"How my day to day eating looks like? PCOS,Weight Loss. ","Hello everyone! I am a 28 year old, female, Indian, I recently lost 12-14 kgs of weight over the course of 1.5 years with sustainable eating and incorporating Yoga, minimal strength workouts at home (2-3 days a week) and lots of walking. I weigh 69kgs now, 5feet 4 inch height. My body fat % is around 25%. I am now incorporating running 2 times a week as well. I have taken whey/whey isolate supplements in the past for 1 year and slowly tapered off as I felt my gut felt better without them. I did go from a daily intake of 80-90g protein to 50-60g and have not noticed any muscle loss. I do have pcos, I left eating meat/fish/chicken since an year, I only consume eggs. Gluten or dairy dont cause any issues, but excess of any one thing upsets my stomach. My main aim now is to lose the last 5 kgs, maintain a good balance between macros, get fitter (build more lean muscle mass), flexible and stronger. I would love to get your advice on if this meal plan looks complete and if there is anything else I can add to make it more holistic. I am finding it a bit challenging to manage protein without overloading on carbs. I do have a history of bingeing (although not diagnosed), so I avoid restricting myself too much on certain foods, so as to avoid doubling on them later. I do want to complete my protein intake without supplements, so would love suggestions. I am also confused as to how much protein to consume, but I stick to 60g mostly. I should mention I lost the weight with the help of a nutritionist's holistic plan , but now maintaining myself. The weight doesnt really seem to shed anymore, so unsure on how to lose the last few kgs. I should also mention, omitting the whey supplements, did help my periods come back and be more regular.

Breakfast (9.30-10AM)  
2 slices wholewheat sourdough or Besan Cheela, 30g Mozzarella/Paneer 250ml Cow Milk with coffee  
OR days when I have eggs, 2 whole eggs and 1 slice wholewheat sourdough, 250ml cow milk with coffee.

Lunch (2.30PM)  
40g of wholewheat roti, paired with 250g of cooked dal (around 30g of raw dal), 200g sauteed sabzi (vegetables with spices), 300g curd full fat, 1 whole cucumber.

Evening Snack (5PM)  
hibiscus or spearmint tea, sauteed foxnuts (makhana) or 1 whole fruit, 1 spoon unsweetened peanut butter.

Dinner (7-7.30PM)  
40g of wholewheat roti or 120g cooked white rice, paired with 250g of cooked dal (around 30g of raw dal), 200g sauteed sabzi (vegetables with spices) 50g Paneer, 1 whole cucumber.

I do eat out 2 times a week and a dessert once a week. I try and sleep in good time and wake up by 8AM for morning yoga.",5,1730804071.0,PCOS,0,1.0,False
1gk3zhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Myprotein/comments/1gk3zhe/what_are_your_top_three_flavours_for_mixing_with/,What are your top three flavours for mixing with oats?,"I never drink whey, I only use it to add to oats or in making a Ninja Creami ‚Äúice cream‚Äù. 

For those who make protein oats, what are your top three flavours? 

I like flavours that are really bold and come through, I‚Äôm not about subtle! I‚Äôve been using cinnamon danish forever but I want to add a couple of different options for variety. 

Chocolate orange appeals but only if it‚Äôs really orangey, as I‚Äôve always found chocolate whey a bit ‚Äòmeh‚Äô. Similarly Mocha, but I‚Äôd want to know that the coffee flavour is really punchy and it‚Äôs not just chocolate with the tiniest hint of coffee.

1gk3yge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1gk3yge/postpartum_research/,Postpartum research ,"I have always considered myself to be a textbook average person (statistically). I'm the legit average height and weight with average features for my area. 

 Since having a baby I have had what I think are fairly average experiences: over a year of compromised sleep and added stress, lifestyle changes, etc. I've also had what I think are fairly average postpartum things: I'm still being treated for hypertension brought to me by growing a human (after a whole life of very low healthy blood pressure) and for the first time ever in my life I had high LDL cholesterol. 

So I'm up early to get a walk in and my favorite longtime activity has been looking up how walking, etc, will improve my health things. This usually inspirea me to keep at it (still does). But today I'm realizing......

I still believe my experience is fairly typical. That postpartum women have big changes to their lives and therefore their bodies. Or even just ladies of a certain age.

Where is the quick mayo clinic guide for that?  Where is the randomized control study about women postpartum that's controlled for sleep or stress or other common sense things we have to do to get the extra exercise in? Where's the study comparing blood pressure in women who sleep well vs. move well vs. eat well?

 Writing this has gotten me over my first mile and convinced me to postpone my second cup of coffee so thanks for hearing me out.",1,1730803789.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False

Okay so I have spent countless hours in perfume stores and scrolling every corner of the internet, but still lacking in inspiration so I thought I'd seek out recommendations from some real people instead. I'm absolutely open to all types of perfumes whether they're niche, designer, indie etc., but sillage means a lot to me. I would prefer to stat under $250 AUD ($165 USD). Something I can smell in store in Australia or order a sample of is preferred. I am open to ordering outside of Australia/internationally if it's something truly worth it. Would prefer EDP or extraits but open to EDT if they're beast mode. Prefer deep feminine but also okay with unisex or ""typically"" male scents.

I'm a **gourmand** lover, generally, but there are some specifics I'm after. I'm looking for something that's sweet to it's core but boozy and strong with good depth and projection. I'll try to include as much information as possible as to not waste anyone's time with fruitless suggestions.

My **top fragrances** I love (not in order) and would love something along these lines:

* Bee by Zoologist
* Rouge Smoking by BDS
* Vanilla 28 by Kayali
* Libre Intense by YSL
* Sweet Vanilla by Montale
* Tobacco and Tonka Bean by Banana Republic

As the title says, I recently bought this espresso machine and was excited because of the good reviews, affordable price, and positive feedback. However, I‚Äôm having an issue‚Äîit makes a very weak coffee. I've only used it three times so far, but each time the coffee tastes more like water with a slight coffee flavor.

I've read through the manual and instructions, but I can't tell if there‚Äôs something wrong with the machine or if I‚Äôm just using it incorrectly. The coffee starts pouring out black for the first few seconds, but then it looks like just colored water, resulting in a very diluted taste. When I add milk, it's practically tasteless.

My husband, to me, is mentally abusive and I have tried so many ways to explain this to him but he simply cannot comprehend.

There was one year I kept getting sick, maybe 4 times, and my husband would literally become angry with me if I didn‚Äôt follow HIS exact steps to get better. 

We ended up traveling internationally during a December to a country that was super cold, a cold we hadn‚Äôt experienced before lol. And before I went on the trip, I was showing some symptoms of a cold. I didn‚Äôt want to cancel this very expensive trip,  so we still ended up going. At first my symptoms weren‚Äôt bad at all, just sore throat and a little coughing. However, I ended up having a fever one of the nights and my cough got really bad. It got WORSE though because my husband told me I needed to ‚Äúcough more‚Äù to get rid of flem but I really didn‚Äôt have much flem. It was more of a dry, itchy cough. 
My husband insisted that I needed to ‚Äúkeep coughing more‚Äù to get rid of the flem.

Mind you, we are walking all day in this freezing weather because we are sightseeing and all that, it‚Äôs also around Christmas time, and I‚Äôm trying to enjoy this country I‚Äôve never been to, so I buy some treats here and there. We buy some hot coco, a dessert the country is well known for, coffee, all the Christmas goodness lol. Without being excessive at all though.  (I don‚Äôt even eat a lot, and I rarely finish drinks, so we often share.)

As soon as we get back to our hotel one night, I am coughing like a beast. Medicine doesn‚Äôt help, my throat is so irritated and painful from the excessive coughing that I didn‚Äôt necessarily need to be doing (but was forced to.) The weather and us being outdoors definitely didn‚Äôt help, so when we settled into our hotel, I wanted to make myself a hot tea to see if it would help a bit. (My cough kept me awake most of the nights) 

I‚Äôm of Latin decent, and we make hot tea with a little bit of sugar, not super uncommon if I‚Äôm not mistaken. My husband saw me picking one small teaspoon of sugar into my tea and immediately started to degrade me and tell me I must NOT want to get better because I obviously wouldn‚Äôt be making tea with sugar if I wanted to get better‚Ä¶??? I literally poured the tea into the sink because I was sickened with his obnoxious blameful tone as if THIS was the reason my cold has gotten so bad ??! 

It‚Äôs cold as shit outside, we were walking all day and night which I don‚Äôt do back at home, I was already sick before we got there, and he was sharing hot co co and coffee with me during the day but THIS drew him over the edge??? He liyerally went crazy, telling me I don‚Äôt know how to take care of myself and that I‚Äôm ‚Äústubborn‚Äù because I don‚Äôt ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to him and his advice. Then he started saying I lack discipline, and I‚Äôm disobedient. We argued a lot about this. Mind you, I had Covid the year before so it makes sense why my immune system was tanked. I do eat healthy but I don‚Äôt workout often, however I am literally 102 pounds, so I‚Äôm clearly not overweight. (I‚Äôm short, so not underweight either.) 

This happened  few years ago and to this day I am afraid of getting sick in front of my husband because he repeats the same shit. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get better because you‚Äôre stubborn and you don‚Äôt listen.‚Äù Literally I‚Äôm just not a big pill person and he would try to force me to take like 10 different pills. So if I didn‚Äôt take those 10 different pills, who got yelled at? Yup. 

I tell my husband often I can‚Äôt open up to him and this is a great example of why. He makes things personal and it somehow affects him if I don‚Äôt do EXACTLY as he says. I‚Äôve tried so many ways to tell him this is a massive fucking problem but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm talking to a goddam wall.

I can‚Äôt imagine the way he would treat me if I ended up (God forbid) with cancer one day if he already thinks it‚Äôs ok to blame a literal virus on me.

Okay so I have spent countless hours in perfume stores and scrolling every corner of the internet, but still lacking in inspiration so I thought I'd seek out recommendations from some real people instead. I'm absolutely open to all types of perfumes whether they're niche, designer, indie etc., but sillage means a lot to me. I would prefer to stat under $250 AUD ($165 USD). Something I can smell in store in Australia or order a sample of is preferred. I am open to ordering outside of Australia/internationally if it's something truly worth it. Would prefer EDP or extraits but open to EDT if they're beast mode. Prefer deep feminine but also okay with unisex or ""typically"" male scents.

I'm a **gourmand** lover, generally, but there are some specifics I'm after. I'm looking for something that's sweet to it's core but boozy and strong with good depth and projection. I'll try to include as much information as possible as to not waste anyone's time with fruitless suggestions.

My **top fragrances** I love (not in order) and would love something along these lines:

* Bee by Zoologist
* Rouge Smoking by BDS

Works been excruciating ","I had my surgery on the 3rd of sept , an anchor scar reduction with lipo on the sides; I had 4 weeks off uni and 6 off work. I am a university student (3 days a week), and I work for a very busy coffee chain.

My boss created a rota with me doing more hours than I asked for (25 when I was contracted 16, and I gave her notice that I wasn't willing to do more). I managed to get my way but was given 9-hour shifts on the weekend, my first 3 weeks back.

I also had to ask her to do a return to work for me, where she said I'd be getting shorter shifts until I'm at 12 weeks. I assumed that meant she'd change my rota, it did not.

I've just finished about 25 hours in 3 days (one week rolling into the next) over the busiest weekend we've had since the summer ended. I am in so much pain, I spent most of yesterday crying and I haven't attended uni today because of the pain I'm in.

Does anyone else work in hospitality? It got to the point where I didn't have the energy to keep messaging her complaining. Hospitality culture is just awful; I don't feel like I can ask to take the extra break that I've asked for as I 'ease' back into work. there's been no phased return at all.

1gk3t3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gk3t3a/i_strongly_dislike_my_dark_brown_eyes/,I strongly dislike my dark brown eyes ,"I hate the dark brown eyes color on me. I think it makes me look bored, uninteresting, plain, common and flat 100%. I don't deny the fact that some people might look average and good suitable with brown eyes but when it comes to myself I just feel so inadequate and dead staring with such undesirable darkness. I guess I inherited the trait from my family (we are all Latin) and I'm still thinking it's dull and boring. Perhaps it's just internalized colorism or hidden racism (not intentionally) I have seen media portraying lighter eyes as the standard beauty and I feel they are right about it. From Light brown, Caramel, Amber, Hazel, Green, Blue, Gray and shades between these colors and mixed are richer and creatives unlike dark brown/black. I know eyes also works for the gift of sight which I am grateful for (I suffer from sensitive dry eyes üëÄ which avoid me to carry colored contacts unfortunately and if I do, I would feel fake after all) But the rest of it, I think I just feel hatred, discomfort and other emotions that only makes me feel sorry myself and entirely plain. I wish a lighter brown will do the right thing for me, Amber or green etc except the ugly brown-black. I have never had any compliments in person about my eyes color üëÅÔ∏è since they lack of life and don't even slightly change against the sunlight at ALL. I feel it but I understand honestly. Having Dark Brown hair doesn't help either. My pale skin which at don't complain at least, would do better and hide my eye bags if it wasn't for the extreme darkness of the iris that makes me think enhance my dark circles around my eye area like a zombie. I really wish a lighter shade will harmonize my sight zone bringing down my unpleasant looking sleepy stare when I just focus my dark eyes into something or someone, this honestly makes me extremely unsatisfied, and the fact I have read people start calling them (about the color in general) ""Mocha Dark"" ""Black Coffee"" ""Root Beer"" ""Black Pools"" etc as a way to romantize them makes the whole situation even more inconvenient since it seems like that's just a failed attempt to make somebody feels good while feeling sorry for them about the trait they have, in this case (dark brown eyes) which has nothing especial about at least in my persona (I would trade them any day of the week) unlike warming light brown, bright gold, sweet caramel, candid honey, exotic amber or unique enigmatic green, or piercing striking blue or fascinating silver gray and other blends together that brings the richness that colored eyes are supposed to. I find my combo shade (dark hair and eyes) in many members of my family and that reminds me a part of myself that I deeply reject.

NOTE: I used to have natural light hair (Light Brown/Dark Blonde) and it was a consolating feeling in relation with the dark eyes (I was born with red hair which makes it even more fantastic) and it saddens me that I have lost forever such great shade. As insane as it sound, I have cried tears of sourness and bitterness when comparing myself with other lucky people owning such great light, vibrant, fantastic and globally exotic shades and can't help but feel envy towards them especially when they get the nice attention and I just become boring and nul.

* When you move out of your exes place, you have your own coffee stuff. P remarks in that level if you end on a kitchen screenshot ""Not all coffee is instant, who knew?"" and from then on is a ""coffee person"" - even though relationships may not work out and in hindsight are generally wrong for us, we always take a little part of that person with us when we move on
* The increasing amount of trinkets from abroad. When I unpacked the little windmill trinket I said aloud ""awww she went to the Netherlands!""
* When you and your partner move into the last house, she's gotten into yoga with you
* In the last house, all your stuff is mixed up in the boxes rather than separated into hers and hers
* Rainbow socks when you move out of your exes place

Bullion Chocolate

Foundry Coffee, though open to any other options (my partner would reject any hamper without coffee I am convinced)

Hendo's obviously

Some quirky little Sheffield postcards or drinks coasters.

Any other ideas?
