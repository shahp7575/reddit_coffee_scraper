1p11txj,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1p11txj/is_it_finished_my_wife_32f_said_she_needed_space/,Is it finished? My wife (32F) said she needed space from me (29M).,"On Friday afternoon, we were deciding what to do about the food shop for the week ahead.

I made a passing comment, something to the effect of ‘is everything ok, you seem distance?’ To which she responded ‘no I’m not ok and I think I need some space from you and us’. 

What has followed has absolutely broken me. 

She was due to go to a party on Friday evening so after she said the above, she got ready, gave me a hug and kiss, told me she loved me and went to the party and stayed at a friend’s house overnight (this was already planned).

On Saturday she texted me saying we needed to talk and returned in the afternoon/evening with the following demands: 

- minimal contact from me, and to only message if it’s logistical about our dog or about needing to go to the house (I WFH and buy/sell on eBay and store in my garage)

- I needed to move out and go live with my parents (she doesn’t have anywhere to go)

- she needed time and space and couldn’t give me a timeline/estimate of how long she needed and couldn’t tell me what was wrong

- she said I hadn’t done anything wrong and that she was just unhappy and needed to sort her head out

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, we’ve been together since we were teenagers, have known each other all our lives and have been married for 8 years next week. We’ve had our ups and downs but it has always been dealt with after a debate and a time to cool down. We’ve always talked through our issues. 

I think I had an attack and blacked out at some point as the next thing I remember was her shaking me and saying my name. I then begged and said don’t go, let’s talk and deal with whatever this is together as a couple. But she left and said that she still wanted us to work, she still loved me, wanted kids and that her leaving was the only way to fix this. 

So I’d tried to be as respectful as I can, only messaging when necessary. Her texts are cold with no emotion, just simple instructions.

On Sunday I was so baffled by the whole situation that I booked myself into counselling to try and process what the F had just happened, and why we were in the situation.

On Monday I went to the doctors to see about getting something to take the edge of the anxiety and panic I’ve been getting. And seeking further advice on more counselling to deal with my own anxiety and issues. 

I’ve texted her today saying I would pick the dog crate up as he was unsettled at my mums house and I would be 15/20mins. Her long term friends were there and they bought the crate out to me and said I wasn’t allowed/shouldn’t go in the house. So I respected the wishes and me and my wife’s long term friend had a chat in my car about what the heck was happening (she seemed just a baffled as me!) 

Later on when I returned to my parents, I’ve received a text from my wife saying that, by turning up to our house unexpectedly without consideration for her or her plans, it’s made her feel unsafe in her own home. And by asking her mum and friends how she was doing (I am genuinely worried for her) that I was not respecting her space. And that this isn’t going to be a short term thing for her to figure out.

I had also spoken to her mum a few times to see if she could shed some light on the situation, and the most she could come up with was your not spending enough time doing what she wants. She also said that we’d been together for so long that she’d lost who she is. And was always worried about me and how I would react to situations.

Everything that’s been said by her is like it’s coming from someone else, this isn’t my wife, this isn’t the person I married. Me, my family, her
Mum and her friends are all baffled by what’s happening.

I’ve slowly got pieces from others around her, not seeing her family as much as she’d like to, wanting to travel more, wanting to open her own coffee shop… all things we had spoken about before and nothing to warrant what was happening. I may have been a bit dismissive in the past but the above was always a passing comment before changing the conversation and never something she’d seriously suggested or looked into (so I thought). 

I have had issues in the past with how much time she has been spending with her ‘new’ best friend, it went from the occasional evening, to every Sunday afternoon, to every Wednesday full day. And then also seeing her most days, either her best friend coming to ours or her going to see her at work etc. I’d come home to them cuddling on the sofa and there were some questionable messages from her friend such as ‘we’re going to live together’ as well as some ‘passive’ controlling behaviour like my wife saying she wasn’t hungry and her friend saying you are eating and that’s final. I know her friend has depression to the point of a missed medication can make her say suicidal things. Is my wife being controlled?

I’m just at a loss, she’s everything to me. It all went so wrong, so quickly. I’m trying to show myself that I can be better husband and show her too that I’m serious about our marriage and our life together. 

Not sure what I’m after here by posting this, maybe some outside perspective on the whole thing.

TL;DR: my wife said she needed space from me, was unhappy and mentally unsure what she needs right now. ",1,1763539824.0,marriageadvice,0,1.0,False
1p11ryw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ARFID/comments/1p11ryw/please_help_me_with_meal_recs/,Please help me with meal recs,"So I’ve been a picky eater since birth but I’ve never struggled THIS much actually finding something I want to eat. I think it may be due to my new ADHD med, it’s like I’m hungry but nothing (even safe foods and easy snacks) sounds appealing.

Since college (6-7 years now) I’ve struggled finding MEALS I actually want to cook and eat. in the end, most of it will be thrown out and I resort to cheese & crackers, a protein bar, fries, 2 Trader Joe’s frozen meals, or frozen pizza. (Note: I do eat up an overpriced pastry from local coffee shop as well). I don’t think it’s the taste, because I’m really not a food connoisseur. It just comes down to being a picky eater I guess?

Anyways- over the years I’ve tried looking up the simplest healthy meals to make and I haven’t found many winners. I used HelloFresh and another similar company which did help for a while! But one day I got the ick from the prepackaged food, plus the expense added up :(  

I know ultimately I could figure this out myself… but as I nibbled on my crackers, I scrolled through this sub and figured I’d ask if anyone in similar situations has any safe go-to meals or snacks! of course I try to eat healthy… but food is food at this point ",1,1763539615.0,ARFID,0,1.0,False
1p11rr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/KDP/comments/1p11rr5/i_just_published_my_first_thriller_novel_after/,"I just published my first thriller novel after months of writing, and I’d love your honest thoughts.","Hey everyone,

After months of late nights, rewrites, anxiety, excitement, and way too much coffee, I finally published my debut psychological thriller **VANCH: Shadows of Lies** on Amazon.

It’s a story that grew out of a simple idea —  
**What happens when people who have nothing in common slowly get pulled toward the same invisible truth?**

The book follows:

* **Shiva** — running from something he can’t explain
* **Dev** — struggling with questions he can’t escape
* **Maya** — connecting dots no one else notices
* **Aastha, Vijay, Abhay, Ravi** — each dealing with their own battles as their paths begin to intersect

The setting moves between Mumbai, dense forests, mountains, and a few places I probably shouldn’t spoil.

I’m not here to spam, just excited (and nervous) to finally share something I’ve worked on for so long. If anyone here loves dark, atmospheric thrillers with mystery and emotional depth, I’d truly appreciate it if you checked it out or even just read the sample.

If you do read it, **I’m open to honest feedback — good, bad, brutal, anything.**

1p11rl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1p11rl1/just_a_marketing_hype_gemini_3_pretty_much_failed/,Just a Marketing Hype Gemini 3 pretty much failed in my language benchmark test.,"Hi, I ask Gemini to do the following task:

write a **single, continuous scene** in which the prose *slowly transitions* through **five distinct authors**, in strict order, *without naming them*:

1. Ernest Hemingway
2. Virginia Woolf
3. Franz Kafka
4. Cormac McCarthy
5. Douglas Adams

**Rules:**

* The transitions must be *invisible*—no section breaks, no “as if written by…”
* Each stylistic shift should be **gradual** over \~150–200 words.
* The final text must still form **one coherent narrative**, not five mini-stories.
* At the end, ask the model to explain **exactly where** each shift begins and ends *and why*.

Gemni answer: 

Introduction This text attempts a ""literary morphing"" technique. The goal is to simulate the distinct voices of five canonical authors—Hemingway, Woolf, Kafka, McCarthy, and Adams—while maintaining a single narrative thread. The scene moves from concrete realism to internal stream-of-consciousness, then to paranoid surrealism, onto mythic bleakness, and finally collapses into science-fiction satire. 2. Main Points The Narrative: The Waiting Room The rain stopped and the station looked clean and wet. The man sat at the table in the corner of the café. He had finished the coffee and it was a good coffee, black and strong, but now the cup was empty. He looked at the waiter. The waiter was reading a newspaper and did not look back. It was a simple thing to wait for a train, but the waiting was long. The man felt the wood of the chair against his back and the cold of the marble table under his hands. He wanted a drink, perhaps a brandy, to take the edge off the dampness that came from the open door. It was not a bad place to wait. It was well-lighted and pleasant. He watched the people moving outside on the platform, their coats heavy with water, moving like soldiers who have forgotten the war. He thought about the tracks and where they went, and how the steel ran true and straight regardless of who rode upon it. But the straightness of the steel seemed to waver as the light caught the windowpane, dissolving the iron into a liquid silver that ran down the glass, blurring the faces of the soldiers into ghosts. It was a moment of suspension, he thought, a pause in the great rushing breath of the world; for what is a station if not a bracket in time, a parenthesis between the leaving and the arriving? He felt a sudden, sharp expansion in his chest, as if the wet coats and the clattering cups and the gray light were all folding inward, becoming part of a vast, intricate tapestry of memory that he had been weaving since childhood. The waiter was no longer just a waiter, but a figure composed of all the waiters he had ever ignored, a phantom of servitude standing in the halo of the gas lamp. The moment stretched, thin and translucent as a moth’s wing, vibrating with the silent thunder of things unsaid, and he felt that if he could only hold this breath, this singular, fragile arrangement of light and sorrow, he might finally understand the terrible, beautiful pattern of his own existence. He realized with a start that the pattern was not beautiful, but rigid, and the waiter was watching him with the unblinking stare of a court official. The man stood up to leave, but the arrangement of the tables had seemingly shifted. He walked toward the exit, but the door was no longer a door; it was a high archway leading to a corridor filed with gray cabinets. He approached a clerk who sat on a high stool. ""I must catch the train,"" the man said, his voice sounding small in the vaulted ceiling. The clerk did not look up. ""To catch the train, one must have the requisite stamped form from the Department of Transit Allocation,"" the clerk murmured, gesturing to a pile of papers that reached the ceiling. The man realized he had never applied for a form, nor did he know that such a department existed. The corridor stretched infinitely, the doors on either side marked with letters that did not correspond to any known alphabet, and he understood with a sinking dread that his presence here was being recorded in a ledger that he would never be allowed to read. He walked on and the corridor grew dark and the floor was covered in a fine red dust. The clerk was gone and the cabinets were gone and there was only the wind howling through the ribcage of the tunnel. He walked for days or hours. The darkness was absolute and the silence was the silence of the grave. He saw a fire in the distance and approached it. A figure sat by the flames wrapped in a blanket of cured hides. The man squatted by the fire. The figure looked up and its face was a map of ancient violence. Where is the train the man said. The figure spat into the fire and the spittle hissed like a viper. There is no train. There is only the track the man said. The track is the world the figure said. The track is the iron vein in the earth's throat and we are the blood that runs cold upon it. The firelight cast long shadows against the tunnel walls and the shadows danced like demons of old. The man looked into the dark and saw the eyes of wolves burning like embers in the void. It was at this precise moment, as the wolves prepared to devour his soul, that the tunnel announced in a cheerful, tinny voice that the 4:15 to Guildford had been delayed due to leaves on the line, or possibly the wrong kind of sunlight. The demonic figure by the fire blinked, reached into its pocket, and pulled out a digital watch that was beeping insistently. ""Oh, bother,"" said the demon, who was actually a shift manager named Gary wearing a very convincing heavy-knit poncho. ""That’s my lunch break over."" The wolves turned out to be a pair of malfunctioning cleaning droids with red LEDs that had been stuck in a conversational loop about the price of copper wiring for three centuries. The man looked around. The tunnel wasn't an ancient hellscape; it was just very poorly maintained by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, whose definition of 'ambient lighting' was legally indistinguishable from 'total sensory deprivation'. It occurred to the man that the universe was not inherently evil, but rather inherently administrative, which was, on balance, significantly worse.

I’m trying to get a better feel for how the “rideshare” part works:
Do they pick him up and drop him directly where he needs to go (curb-to-curb), or does the vehicle make a bunch of stops (other people’s houses) along the way?
How long do trips usually take? Is 90 minutes a hard max or just a guideline? For example, how long roughly might it take for him to ride from the White Lane and South h area to the North Chester and China grade loop area? He likes to have coffee with his friends one day a week. Just trying to understand how long before the coffee time we would need to schedule him being picked up and do they give a actual time or a window of time when you will be picked up and dropped off?
Can I or another caregiver ride along with him? He needs some medical attention sometimes, so I want to make sure someone can be in the vehicle with him.
If anyone here uses or helps someone use GET-A-LIFT, would really appreciate hearing how it works in real life.

1p11quo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteriesRP/comments/1p11quo/isaac_the_battle_plan/,Isaac - The Battle Plan,"[https://docs.google.com/document/d/10nHIftWILtrrJa7OjYPz2LUZklP-9ooXWl9RPUsRtmI/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10nHIftWILtrrJa7OjYPz2LUZklP-9ooXWl9RPUsRtmI/edit?tab=t.0)  
  
The note arrived after dinner, folded cleanly, unadorned, slipped beneath his door without disturbance. Isaac noticed the fiber first, cheap pulp stock, recycled, flecked with traces of powdered graphic.   
  
Likely someone accustomed to maps. Or bombs.  
  
He opened it.



A request from rebellion. An invitation, really, as if one invited a physician to inspect a corpse. “We are close to execution,” it read. “One of the lesser major buildings. Seizable. We require confirmation. You have one day.”



No name. No signature. He ran his thumb down the page, eyes unfocused, reading the mind not the words. They wanted him to survey a building. Determine viability of infiltration. They thought he was theirs.



*But neutrality is not a void*, Isaac thought to himself, *It is a ledger. One writes only facts.*



He folded the note and slipped it into his coat.



The night air outside Caelastria’s central district was cold enough to make each exhale visible, clarity made manifest. Isaac liked weather that revealed things like this.



The target building was unremarkable: four stories, state-funded, in the administrative quarter. Clerks by day. Paperwork, requisitions, financial appendices. The sort of place rebellions believe is “strategic” and “useful” because paper is often confused for power. Isaac surveyed it from across the street, hands in his pockets, the way an ordinary man might simply be waiting for someone to come out.



He watched.



***Guards.***

***Four at night, two in the front, one in the rear alley, one patrolling the roof.***

***Rotations every 15 minutes.***

***Boots scuffed, mismatched heights, half were replacements, not full-time.***



***Windows.***

***Second-floor latch warped, condensation marks showing it was open regularly and recently.***

***An office work with insomnia? Or corruption?***



The building breathed faintly to Isaac, revealing secrets swelling between the bricks and cracks.



A man with a briefcase exited, lockin the front door. Isaac noted the way his hand trembled slightly while inserting the key. *Overwhelmed workload? Fear? More likely the cold.*

The man wore no gloves, and once he had left and rounded the corner, Isaac struck.



He crossed the street, circled behind the building, stepping through puddles lightly, the sound absorbed rather than made and splashed. *A shadow is just a body that learnt good manners after all.* The rear guard leaned against the wall, humming. The melody was off-key, randomly pitched. Horrid.



Isaac timed the footsteps above, the roof guard walking left to right, predictable, methodical. He didn’t attack, there was no need. As soon as the rear guard exhaled deeply, the body’s lazy moment, he slipped past the back window with surgical precision. Inside the building, no sound, the deep smell of ink, paper and an electrical sting of machinery left in sleep mode. 



They couldn’t even turn off properly. It’s clean, but not cared for.



The office floors revealed themselves as he walked through the building, carefully, quietly.



The first floor made up a reception, storage closets, two night staff asleep at their desk. *Exhaustion written in their shoulders.*



The second floor was the requisition archives, requests, needs made mandate. Desk rooms for typewriters and recording staff who already left.



*Behaviour of the building, mirrors the behaviour of people.*



A poorly maintained hinge, cracks in walls, creaky doors and dust everywhere, where the staff don’t go often, or long. The workers don’t care for maintenance forms.



Isaac walked past aisles of desks, fingers hovering above drawer labels but touching none. He cannot let his curiosity win here, not yet. Repeatedly misfiled files in the wrong drawers, coffee mugs away from table edges, so many little details tell him a story.



He paused, an out-of-place form on a desk, left alone, unwrit. A requisition stamped red and denied. Odd. *The rebels rarely target buildings that are already failing themselves.* He moved on to the stairwell upwards.



Third floor, plenty of financial offices, two safe rooms, one in event of attacks and emergencies, the other as safe storage for valuables, documents, whatever required special care. There was also security enchantments, but they were weak, rudimentary runework, symbolic more than functional. *Trying to scare off the uninitiated or those who don’t know better.*



Up again, the fourth and final floor. A communication hub, active light-crystals, and a map of Caelastria pinned on a corkboard. Green pins seemed to be for supplies and their hubs, Red pins to be oversights or missed issues cropping up, Blue pins had nothing, just forms upon forms of pending reviews.



The blue pins became more and more numerous, tapping the map lightly.

***Rebels want this building. They don’t know the building is already drowning.***



He snuck into an empty corner office on the third floor, closing and pulling the curtains of the door behind him to hide himself better. The window looked out across the street, moonlight falling in a diagonal pattern over the desk. 



*Good enough.*



He removed a pouch from his coat, a small leather one, brown, containing his Tarot deck.

Not fashionable, not ornamental, just functional and a bit worn.



As he set down the three cards, he flipped them over in an array for tonight.

**The Hermit**

**The Tower (reversed)**

**Justice.**



He stared.



Not a mystical revelation, but his pattern recognition enhanced by a cogitation trance. He pinched his index and thumb together, turning a page over as he activated his Spirit Vision, checking the room briefly but discovering nothing.



Hermit, the one who observes and doesn’t participate, keeping away from the world. His role tonight.

Tower, reversed, its meaning of a crisis avoided but the instability remains.

Justice, the consequences are inevitable, whether moral or mechanical.



He already knew the meaning:

The building can fall, and likely will. But only because it was already leaning over.



A gentle inhale, the detective’s mind sharpened, emotions dimming, thought turning crystalline.



*The building is structurally and bureaucractically weak. Taking it is possible. Far too possible.*



The rebellion would likely see it as a success, and the Magispirium only seeing it as data. Isaac himself, saw the ledger of reality as is.



He pulled his coat hood up, and walked right out the front door as he left.

He did not bother with stealth this time, the guards would rationalize it as a shadow, perhaps a trick of their eyes being tired, or a coworker leaving particularly late. 

Humans, they excuse way more than they question.



Outside, he breathed the cold air once again, the streetlimps quietly flickering overhead.



Time to head home.

  


He met their courier just before dawn, a thin woman, a scarf pulled over her face. Isaac handed her a sealed note of his finding for the building.

———————

The plan is viable. The building is understaffed, undermaintained, and insecure.

Your window of success is real, but brief.

I advise caution, instability collapses unpredictably.

———————



Nothing more.

No support, no sabotage, neutrality as precision.



Afterwards, he headed home properly, and waited. An hour, two. Then went to meet the Magispirium admin, to hand over his findings, as he was placed in the rebellion under their request.



He gave them their own note, sealed, a quiet report to the same fellow he met before since it was noted to not talk to anyone else about it.

—————

The rebellion intends to seize Administrative Office 14-H.

The structure’s strategic value is low.

Security, insufficient.

They will likely succeed, if, they attempt an incursion within the next 40-48 hours.



Recommend: minimal intervention. Let them take the building, document the outcome. The chaos will reveal the hierarchy and scramble for power within their structure.

————



He paused, before talking, his voice calm, measured.

“I had access to all four floors, I saw no sensitive material remaining, though I had limited time to work with. The rebellion’s gain here is symbolic, not functional gain.”



The fellow ahead of him gave a brief nod, showing he heard Isaac as he read over the note. Then gesturing with a hand, “We shall give you another assignment sometime soon, the information is useful. You may leave.”



And so,

Isaac left, grabbed his daily necessities from the market and headed home to enjoy a day of reading. *Perhaps I should give that Archivist a visit again sometime.*

I'm a little hesitant to post here but I think it is the case with all of the students. I'm also a student and I have to travel a lot because of studies and I also love travelling. But every time I find myself searching on Google 'is this place safe to go' and I end up with generic reviews and years old threads. There is not a single method to know is place is actually safe and should I visit. This is the case with almost all students who leave their home town for studies.

I remember during my first year I skipped plans because most of my friends were day scholars and I don't want to come back my pg alone . I was so literally so frustrated and have to come back to my pg before 7 most of the times. Every time I want to explore somewhere new or plan a trip, it's the same anxiety: checking five different sources, asking random people, still not knowing for sure. I don't have a big friend group just me and my 2 friends and that's why it still a problem for us!

**Here's what I realized:** nobody tracks the information that actually matters for solo travelers especially women. Not which cafe has good coffee, but whether you'll get harassed walking there alone at 7 PM.

Therefore I'm building a product called Safe or Not, it is a very simple product just type in the location and get women safety, transit safety etc. reviews from crowdsource data. You also have access to latest scams and recent news so you don't have to juggle between posts.

We dated for 4.5 years, and for 3.5 years, i told him to take care of his health, and get checked out for sleep apnea, because i knew he had it, and he refused. Constantly said how stupid I was for “thinking” he had it. 
Well, he died, in his sleep. From sleep apnea. At 32 years old. 

Which brings me to my point now. 
Ive been working on my health for the last year, im currently down 100lbs, still have more to lose. But im doing it, and naturally. 
Eating healthier, working out. 
I wasnt only doing it for myself, Im doing it for the future with my BF now. I want kids, i wanna get married and have a family. And i cant do that, if im severely overweight. (I gained a lot of weight after my previous BF died; i was already fat, but now i was even fatter) 

My dad passed away when I was 8, due to his weight and health issues that came with that. So a combination of these things, really kicked it into high gear for me. 

That being said. 
My BF has a very very VERY high salt diet. He will literally drink soy sauce and Puts it on everything. Eats fast food almost everyday of the week. 
Rarely drinks water. All he consumes really,  is soda, tea, coffee and energy drinks.

We were on the phone earlier, he picked up McDonalds, and then went to his Dr’s appointment. 
He got his lab results back, and everything was fine. And he was super happy about it. 
As he’s telling me this, hes literally shoveling food (his McDonalds) into his mouth. And I can barely understand him because he was talking with his mouth extremely full of food. 

And i told him, just because your lab results are fine; NOW. Doesnt mean they will be in a year from now. And i posed my concerns with him, for the 8 millionth time. 
I told him that he needs to start taking better care of himself. 
Because i cant be the only one making sure my health is in check for our future together. 
And he kept laughing and brushing it off; saying he was “FINE”. (He was already unhappy with the weight on the scale at the appointment) Which made me extremely upset. Because again, ive gone through this before. 
The topic was dropped, and brought up again later in the night.
And told him, that he needs to start doing better or i wont be dealing with it. 
I was called selfish. 
And i snapped back and said. “NO. You! You are being selfish!!!! Knowing ive already gone through this once!!!! And YOU are doing it to me, AGAIN!!! Im doing what I CAN to better my health for ME, YOU and OUR future family. And I cant even get the same back!? Now THATS SELFISH!” 

And im literally truly thinking about ending things, because he will not take care of himself. And the fact that he finds the whole thing a freaking joke. 
Ive brought this up to him, plenty of times. Never saying anything mean, or demeaning. I say things like, “i wish youd take better care of yourself, i really want you around for as long as possible” 
“I care about you, i want to spend as much time with you as possible” 
I probably shouldnt have put so much blame on him during our last conversation about it, but I was extremely upset, especially because he brushes it off, laughs about it and completely ignores it most times. 
And it really makes me feel like he does not care about me. At all. 
Ive gone through this at 8 when my biological dad passed away. I went through the pain when my step dad passed almost 4 years ago, and i went through this when my previous BF passed away, exactly a year after my step dad. 
And yes. Exactly a year. My step dad passed 1-13-22 and my ex passed 1-13-23. 

I feel like an AH, but at the same time; i dont. im hurt, upset, and anxious among many other things. 
Am i the AH for being concerned and asking this of him? 
And will i be the AH if i break it off, if he continues dismissing and laughing about my concerns about his health?

I apologize for the lengthy read. Thank you for reading, commenting and helping me out. 🖤

From Criterion: Gary Cooper, Fredric March, and Miriam Hopkins play a trio of Americans in Paris who enter into a very adult “gentleman’s agree­ment” in this continental pre-Code comedy, freely adapted by Ben Hecht from a play by Noël Coward and directed by Ernst Lubitsch. A risqué relationship story and a witty take on creative pursuits, the film concerns a commercial artist (Hopkins) unable - or unwilling - to choose between the equally dashing painter (Cooper) and playwright (March) she meets on a train en route to the City of Light. *Design for Living* is Lubitsch at his sexiest, an entertainment at once debonair and racy, featuring three stars at the height of their allure.

I was nineteen and broke in that distinctly unromantic way where you catch your own reflection in a store window and think, *well, that guy needs a job more than he needs dignity*. I’d been nursing this crush on aquariums - living art in glass boxes, the drifting confetti of neon tetras, that gentle gurgle of air breaking the surface like a thought rising to the top too soon. A little science, a little mystery, and Latin words aplenty that made me feel like I’d snuck backstage at nature’s opera. **Perfect.**

The problem, of course, was I didn’t know a damn thing about keeping fish ((nervous smile)).

But here’s the deal - there’s a motto that has served me with all the reckless loyalty of a half-trained dog (in fact, can you get more loyal than a half-trained dog?? He’s there beside you - not because it’s what he’s full-on trained for - no, half trained means he *wants* to be there… but I digress) - the motto:

**Fuck it - head first, feet first, either way - I’m going in.**

And so in I went, gliding past the counter like a man with a destiny, bee-lining for the fish room, grabbing two or three species names the way a pickpocket palms wallets - trying my best to sound like I’ve read *Dr. Axelrod's Atlas of Freshwater Aquarium Fishes* cover-to-cover, I (half) absorbed the fish names, written in brightly colored paint pen on the upper left corner of the aquariums…

[Pterophyllum scalare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterophyllum_scalare?wprov=sfti1#) here - [Puntius tetrazona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_barb?wprov=sfti1#) there - something with “pleco” in it because that sounded serious. 

Mispronounced *everything* - didn’t matter. I felt armed.

I handed my application directly to the manager - you know, just like old people say you should ((shrug)) worked then, not so much now. He offered an on-the-spot interview. I offered the kind of earnest, high-stakes bluff only a teenager caught between desperation and the [Legend of the Rent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6eeDK8v8a8) (that was way past due) can muster. 

You’re not hardcore, unless you live hardcore - *somehow* - I talked my way right into the fish department. And you know what? They paid me to learn. Life is merciful in odd places.

About a year later, out at a fish wholesaler with my manager, I succumbed to the weight of my interview indiscretion - I confessed… 

Zedd: ((eyes downcast)) Dennis… I **BS’d** my way through that interview. I didn’t know anything.

(He stopped cold, looked at me like I’d just confessed to being the [Dread Pirate Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dread_Pirate_Roberts?wprov=sfti1) - Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning.)

Long seconds passed before he finally put a hand on my shoulder.

Dennis: You? Oh, I knew. You mispronounced everything. You said the plecostomus was an *allergy* eater. I hired you because you worked a cash register at a grocery store - I needed someone who knew how to handle a busy Saturday cash-and-wrap counter.

(Beat.)
((Confusion.))
(((Recalibration.)))

“Dennis,” I said, “I never worked the register at the grocery store. They never taught me.”

(Beat two.)
((Wider confusion.))

And then laughter - one of those double-falls where each of you drops straight through the floor of your own assumptions. A miniature farce. A gentle one. The kind Lubitsch would have staged with a sideways grin and a door that closes just before you hear the punchline.

That moment - two characters discovering they’ve each been playing the wrong scene - is the closest I’ve ever come to feeling the [Lubitsch Touch](http://lubitsch.com/the-lubitsch-touch.html) without a movie screen in sight.

The Touch (as I understand it), isn’t a “style” - it’s a *rhythm*. A game of implication instead of declaration. The audience gets the joke - not when it’s delivered - but when they’re invited to leap the gap. The cut does the telling. The silence does the talking. 

*Charm moves diagonally.*

What Lubitsch understood - and this is where the academic paper - [Love Objects: Eros and the Materialistic Aesthetics of Ernst Lubitsch | Film-Philosophy](https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full/10.3366/film.2023.0217), I stumbled into by accident turns the house lights up a little - is that objects inherit the emotional residue of the scene. A coffee cup becomes the ghost of a confession. A spoon lingers with the warmth of a flirtation. A handbag shuts down like a heart suddenly guarded. These things don’t symbolize… they *remember*.

It’s a lovely idea: that the inanimate world absorbs a trace of us, carries it forward, and reveals us (gently) when we’re not looking.

The article gets **thick** (in a good way, in that swamp-deep, “how did I end up here learning about [Deleuze](https://iep.utm.edu/gilles-deleuze/) when all I wanted was a snippet?” way). It talks about tactile spectatorship and desire displaced into objects, the way a well-placed prop can carry the charge of a whole unsaid feeling. That’s the *thick*, high-academic phrasing… but I’d felt it, long before I had the vocabulary to express it - in my pet store story: that lone register on the glass counter, the cash-drawer bell chiming over the top of the steady, effervescent hiss of the fish-room filtration. If I close my eyes, I can still see myself standing among the hypnotic stained-glass colors glittering from the scales of a thousand species.

I thought Dennis hired me for my fish knowledge; he thought I came trained for cash registers; the truth sat in the space between us - a third thing, invisible (but present) - like a prop placed in perfect comedic symmetry.

Lubitsch would have cut from that silence at the wholesaler to two fish darting past each other in opposite directions. *No dialogue.* Just the shape of the truth, disguised as motion.

And I guess that’s where the whole thing lands for me tonight: I know Lubitsch the same way I knew aquariums at nineteen - not by mastery, but by stumbling enthusiasm. By cinematic mispronunciation. By going in head-first and trusting the room to teach me. And sometimes the room teaches you through a manager named Dennis. And sometimes through a lonely typewriter shot across a table in 1933.

Any way around it, I don’t think the Touch is about the *cleverness*. Lubitsch left the gap and celebrated the swing between beats. The moment when two people realize they’ve each been playing different scenes, and somehow that makes the story better (not worse).

And somewhere in that space - between the fish names I stole and the academic footnotes I didn’t mean to wander into - there’s a little Lubitsch reel spinning.

Gently.

Indirectly.

Smiling at its own timing.

Movie on.

Side note: just so you’re in “the know” - a [Hypostomus plecostomus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypostomus_plecostomus?wprov=sfti1#) is an **algae** eater, not an *allergy* eater. ((Wink-wink)) Caulerpa on!

After way too many hours of research (and several nights convincing myself I didn’t need a La Marzocco…), I finally picked up my first setup. I landed on a Lelit Victoria paired with the Lelit Fred. The sales staff pushed hard for a Baratza, but honestly the Lelit pair just looks so clean on the counter.

That said, the Fred started giving me tiny annoyances. The grind-size dial would drift after use, and the consistency wasn’t quite there. After chatting with the folks at Seattle Coffee Gear, I swapped it for a Baratza grinder.

And wow. It was a game changer. The shots suddenly matched the tasting notes on the bag, and the flavor got noticeably thicker and more textured. Same beans, way better experience.

Just wanted to share in case anyone else is shopping around or debating grinders. Don’t underestimate how much the grinder matters!",1,1763538343.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

No matter what I did, I never had clear skin, except for a period in my life staying in Thailand for 6 months (which I ended up thinking the weather helped it).  
This year my skin went out of control and the acne around my jawline became terrible, so searching I figured it was hormones. 
In my teens and early 20s the pill helped to calm it down, but gave me other very negative health effects, so I didn't want to take that again.  
I started to think, what could it be?  
Hmm what about alcohol? Because I drink about once a week, and after a night out (every few months) my skin is pretty bad.  
Gave that a go of no alcohol and noticed skin improving, but still not great.  
Is it caffeine?! It couldn't be... I only drink coffee black and I have tea with just milk..  
However when I was much younger I didn't drink coffee and tea and my skin was better... And in Thailand I didn't either...  
Okay I'll give it a go and see...  

A month of no caffeine and my skin is at its best it has been for years, no itchy painful acne on my jawline and chin!  
Recently I messed up and accidentally drank lemonade that has green tea in it, and had houjicha over a few days (thought it was mugicha - no caffeine) and a gingerbread latte that I thought had no caffeine, and my acne came back again. Which just confirms it was caffeine (and alcohol) that was messing my skin up over those many years.  

A few days of no caffeine again, and already my skin is calming down.  

I'm happy I found my cure, but also a bit sad since I really enjoyed drinking coffee and alcohol! Though it's worth not drinking to have better skin!  ",4,1763538106.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

Our manager asked everyone to declutter your personal areas, which, in office language, means: throw away everything you forgot you owned but will suddenly feel emotionally attached to once someone tells you to toss it.
While I was going through my drawer, I found a bizarre coiled rubber thing labeled c hose, which I definitely didn’t buy and have no memory of acquiring. It looked like something between plumbing equipment and a prop from a low-budget sci-fi film.
I held it up and asked my coworker, “Does this belong to anyone?”  She stared at it like it was cursed. Another coworker claimed it was “probably from facilities.” Facilities claimed it was “definitely not ours.”
We ended up forming a small investigation committee, which, in our office, means three people standing around pretending to care while sipping coffee. One person suggested it might be a sample someone ordered online during the Great Office Organization Craze of 2022 when everyone was buying random supplies from wherever was cheapest, including listings that suspiciously resembled Alibaba photos.
Nobody knew. Nobody wanted it. Yet nobody felt comfortable throwing it away because what if it was important?
So now it sits on the new shelf like a sacred artifact, carefully placed between a forgotten label maker and a stack of manuals nobody has read since the Obama administration.
I swear, every workplace has at least one mysterious object that outlives entire employee generations. If we ever move offices, that hose is absolutely coming with us. It’s basically part of the team now.",7,1763538096.0,talesfromthejob,0,1.0,False

85,000 level broke like it was nothing


Today’s vibe:
If Sensex holds above 84,950–85,000, we might see a push toward 85,150–85,200.
If it slips below 84,900, expect a small pullback — but bulls still look in control.

1p11btr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p11btr,Taiwan just does it different.,"Taiwan understands Third Wave coffee better than anyone else in my opinion. My wife and I went back to Taiwan (might become a yearly thing) and we went to our two favorite coffee spots in Taipei, Songshan District. Gabee and Rebirth Coffee. 

Gabee is my hands down favorite. Van Lin, the Owner is a master of his craft and just an all around awesome person. I showed him my failed latte art and he immediately saw the problem and gave me steps to fix it. I noticed he had some new special drinks so I had to try them. I always get two drinks when I'm there. First, 2 shots of espresso over ice with a bit of sweet cream. This is my go to as it changes based on the beans he is using that day and so it's always a new experience. The first day we went there I tried his new World Championship Irish Coffee. And oh my God this was the best Irish coffee I've ever had in my life. He also had a new drink which infused grape juice and pop rocks. It was incredible. 

The other shop we went to was Rebirth Coffee. They specialize in pour overs. I had the privilege to try their championship bean that they were using in this year's Taiwanese Championship and it was this incredible dark currant and cherry flavor that had the most amazing aftertaste. The owners were even kind enough to roast their special edition beans specifically for me that they currently weren't selling as they were rotating some other beans in. These taste strongly of Japanese Melon and Peach. Amazing

Needless to say we went back to each multiple times and each time was making me love coffee and espresso all over again. I cannot say this enough. If you love coffee, go to Taiwan. Their bar for quality is so incredibly high there and people take coffee VERY seriously. 

Side note: we did also go to a coffee convention that was happening during our trip and at the La Marzocco booth we got to try out their new Strada Machine. Totally insane and costs almost as much as my new car lol. ",4,1763537840.0,espresso,1,0.75,False

It’s <5 weeks until my test date. I got the official news yesterday that after months of suffering and feeling like I was the laziest, sleepiest med student there ever was, I got my sleep study results that diagnosed me with the chronic sleep disorder, Idiopathic Hypersomnia. My doctor said I now need urgent treatment with meds (modafinil and sodium oxybate).

I knew in my heart of hearts that this was coming based on my laundry list of symptoms. I was half assing every aspect of my life: sleeping through required classes, isolating the people I loved in order to prioritize sleep, falling asleep anywhere and everywhere (including coffee shops, gas station parking lots, and while driving), only being able to study on the treadmill in order to not fall asleep, barely scraping by on in-house exams, and falling into a deep depression over not recognizing myself as the once type A student. As you can imagine, Step1 studying got kicked to the curb.

Despite all of this, I am delusional and part of my brain still thinks somehow, someway I can pull off not studying or keeping up with material for all these months and pass 😀 …. yeah right 🙃??

I’m sitting at a 44% correct on UWorld with 22% complete. Got a 44% on my CBSE back in October. With my new diagnosis and the prospect of increased wakefulness with my new meds, do I bother kicking it into high gear and trying to study for Step1? Do I take the 5 weeks to sleep and get into a routine? Prepare for clinical rotations instead?

I know I should feel relieved after finally getting a diagnosis, but I feel so frustrated that so much time was wasted on something I couldn’t control. I’m angry and jealous of everyone who feels light years ahead of me now because they could stay awake and I couldn’t. Other days, I’m delusional as I mentioned and think I can overcome this in time and not have to take step1 and step2 together and stress myself out next January.

If you have any advice or similar experiences with sleep issues and test taking, or had to delay your step1 exam for other circumstances, I’d love to hear. I talked to my academic advisor but I feel like sometimes they just give you the politically correct “take care of yourself” talk because it’s what they’re supposed to say.

**Also for those curious about my sleep study results😅: 11 hour long polysomnograph (PSG) that showed >50% REM sleep (max test time is supposed to be 8 hours lol). 5 nap multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) that showed I slept for all 5 of the 20 min naps with an average sleep latency of 2.8 mins (normal >/= 10 mins, pathological sleep disorder <5 mins).",1,1763537829.0,step1,0,1.0,False

Suae goes back home really distressed after what happened with Eunhyuk in his car. She doesn’t cry, she’s just upset. She spends some time reflecting until she gets a call from Dohwa. He says something about their blind date, or the day they’re supposed to meet, or maybe he asks why she hasn’t contacted him. Or maybe about the rumor with the actress. The point is that Suae laughs awkwardly and answers with some nonsense, which makes Dohwa ask, “Were you crying?” And after Suae fumbles around trying to avoid the question, she suddenly breaks down crying. Through her sobs she tells him, “I’m sorry, there’s something I haven’t told you, I’m sorry,” maybe even letting Eunhyuk’s name slip out, or something like “bastard,” and so on. And Dohwa just says, “Tell me where you are, I’ll bring you food.” They actually meet, and Dohwa buys her a coffee. They sit across from each other in awkward silence, and then Dohwa says, “So, to sum it up: Go Eunhyuk ignored you for ten years, you ran into him on your first blind date with that guy, now you’re working together, and a little while ago you kissed him to get answers, but he didn’t give you any?”

Suae gets embarrassed, because hearing it from someone else makes her feel childish and a bit humiliated. Suddenly she becomes very aware of the decisions she’s made. The conversation becomes more serious, until Dohwa says:

“But why do you need an answer? Isn’t the silence he’s kept already one? Not everything needs a reason. Sometimes people act just because, and that’s not your fault. It was simply a decision he made thinking only of himself.” This makes Suae reflect, but she brings up the fact that she feels guilty for not handling something private she saw about Eunhyuk and his family. And feeling that way, on top of the love points, makes her feel selfish. Then Dohwa answers again:

“What’s wrong with being selfish? I’m not saying this just because I have my own hidden motives—because I do—but what’s wrong with having them? No one loves 100% unconditionally. We’re all expecting something. There’s no such thing as perfectly pure love. But as long as it’s sincere, then it’s true love. You shouldn’t feel guilty for loving in your own way. That level of unconditional devotion only exists in stories, and someone always gets hurt. Loving someone isn’t always about enduring the wounds they cause you—especially when they’re not trying to heal them. You need to take responsibility for your own actions.”

And that’s it. That was what I imagined. I swear it was full cinema in my head, and I really doubt the author will ever write something like this in the next chapters. Plus, I also want Suae to be a bit more self-aware and responsible for her actions, by herself.

But anyway, it was just a fictional scenario that entertained me while I was trying to sleep (now I’m completely awake, damn it). That’s it, I wanted to share it with you guys hahssjdn good night 🫡😴",9,1763537786.0,Dohwatea,9,1.0,False

3. Ad Concept: A skit where Practical Paul struggles with a bulky wallet, fumbling to find his cards while trying to pay at a coffee shop. He becomes frustrated, showing the pain points of complexity and inefficiency. Suddenly, he pulls out the Ridgewallet in Gunmetal, showcasing how easily he can access his cards and cash. The skit ends with him feeling relieved and satisfied, emphasizing simplicity and functionality.

And a list of hooks to select from that spoke to the persona's motivations 

Will add the creative in the comments. It's not prod ready, but I have put that in their brief generator with all of the content above as a supporting document.

hey, 

about me: early 30s, working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks, lazy sundays and real convos more than parties or small talk. into photography, 3d design and small web/homelab projects. i’ve spent the last few years focusing on skills and hobbies, so i’m new to dating but ready to try.

why i’m here: dating apps felt shallow and too hookup-heavy. most weekends i just end up scrolling, and i want to change that. i’m looking for something real, honest and slow-build.

what i’m like:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk

loyal, not into drama

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills


what i’m looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don’t have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i’ll respect your worldview and i’m looking for someone who’ll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down or dismiss, we won’t match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that’s what i’m after.

last thing: i’d rather hear “hey this isn’t a vibe” than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion.

if this feels like your vibe, say hi and tell me one of these: fav cafe, ideal lazy weekend, or a song you can’t stop replaying. reply or dm, no pressure, no pics upfront.

thanks for reading. felt like progress :)",1,1763537554.0,DatingInIndia,2,1.0,False

Yes this is a reupload since I reformatted stuff to make it easier to read and balanced a few things. And also mainly, ART. By me! Except I never wanna do this again… if somebody is willing to help me draw stuff for concepts please PLEAAASE let me know. This was torture. And also, OC means original character. This isn’t like… my persona or smth it’s legit just a character I made just for this X3 please enjoy!

(Note: picture 1 and 2 is base ember picture 3 is MIV ember.)

It’s been a good second since I’ve posted and I have decided to try and make an OC concept this time! (This is not related to the 666 update I swear I started this before it was announced I swear I swear—). Also I decided I’d try doing this weekly because why not…

Custom effects:
Witherblade: depending on the stack of this effect, the duration of any given stun will increase by 50%. Capping at witherblade VI (400%)

Ember

$888

Sentinel

45 hp.

Regular speed: 12

Sprinting speed: 26

Max stamina: 100

Stamina loss per second: 10

Stamina gain per second: 20

Purchase quote:
“I am what survives the end.”

Description:
“A being forged from fire and erasure, he wields the Oblivion Blade to survive a world that no longer exists. Every strike risks everything, yet keeps him alive.”

Passives:

(Cleansing flame):
“LET THE MARTYRS BURN!!!”

any burning effect on ember heals him instead of dealing damage. The amount healed is equal to the amount he’d take if he’s hit by the burning. If ember is actively getting inflicted with burn this amount increases by 1 damage per dmg (so if he’s hit with 0.35 from burn, if he’s actively getting burned he heals 1.35 instead). Coolkid hard counter XD

(Dispel): 
“With this body of my creator, their chains cannot touch me…”

Ember cannot be inflicted with bleeding, corrupted, or poison. However, each one of these effects is swapped for weakness instead with the stack increasing from the severity of the effect.

(Last stand): 
“I give myself… to survive the end…”

if Ember is the LMS, all his damage dealing abilities instantly begin to deal 2x damage and inflict deletion IV (3% hp decrease per second) for 3 seconds. However, his witherblade is locked at II for the rest of the game. He also gains 50 hp

Abilities:
(Severance/erasure): 
“Just a spark… but it can cut through anything…” (severance)

“Feed the flame… and it will give you life.’… I must endure it, whatever it takes.” (Erasure)

cooldown: 10s 
Description: for each (this means after using the move which causes it to switch, the player must wait 10s before using the other variant)
Description: Severance causes ember to take out his dagger and do a 0.15s  windup before jabbing forwards. The jab has 0.2s of endlag. The jab gives ember 2s of speed II if it lands and 1.5s of slow III if it misses (if the distance from killer is > 40 studs changes to 4s). If the stab hits the killer it also knocks the killer back and inflicts slow IV for 2*(1+0.1*witherblade stack) seconds while stunning for 0.3s. It also grants 1 charge of immolation while dealing 25 dmg. If the stab misses ember’s aura is highlighted to the killer for 4s. After using severance the ability switches to erasure. If erasure is used, Ember forcibly erases a part of himself, severing flame from flesh. He gains 40 temporary HP (like max ho and it can stack). This move takes 3 seconds to use. If there are any negative debuffs on ember at this time they are also cleansed. It also creates a small burning area on the ground dealing 0.35 dmg per second to anybody (including the killer and survivors) standing inside it that lasts 3 seconds. This area heals ember instead inflicting burn. The move switches back to severance after. If ember is interrupted while using the ability, it fails but still switches back to severance.

(oblivion blade): 
“Now… witness the end of what should not have survived.”

cooldown: 45 seconds

Description: after 1.2s of windup, ember does a massive leap backwards while doing a spin before rushing forwards with their blade out, launching themselves forwards (similar to two times stab but going farther). Ember while moving can curve, sort of gliding but they can’t move too accurately and he slows down a bit if he’s turning. Ember may also not curve for the first 0.8s of the move however afterwards he could curve freely and even travel backwards like in a U-turn. After traveling for 5s, ember automatically smashes their sword into the ground causing a massive explosion that deals 20 damage to him and causes an aoe blast that if the killer is close enough to, deals 50 damage and stuns for 3 seconds. Unlike two time’s stab though, this slam will not auto activate when hitting the killer. Instead, if the ability is used again early, the slam will activate mid rush. The radius is pretty small so it’s really hard to get this to work. If the slam directly hits though, killers are inflicted with burn II for 4 seconds and blindness III for 8 seconds along with being knocked away and taking 75 damage. The killer also gets stunned for 5 seconds instead along with having their aura revealed to all survivors for 2 second. The radius for this stun is EVEN smaller though. It takes insane precision and prediction to even hope to land this version. If the player misses completely and slams the ground with the killer not even being in the blast radius, they take 30 damage and are forced to sit through a 3 second long animation of ember pulling their blade out the floor. If the slam lands it’s reduced to 1s (so they land the slam and only take 1s to take their blade out). Their aura is also revealed to the killer for 8 seconds if they mess up. The slam does create a small area that inflicts burn II and slow I for anybody standing inside the area like in immolation. This area lingers for 3 seconds. Oh and for balancing purposes if the killer is stunned for more than 10 seconds by an oblivion blade, their stun immunity duration is increased by like 2x increasing by another 1x for every extra 5s. For every additional ember in the match stun time decreases by 0.5s. Move cannot be canceled midway through by the killer by moves except nova, entanglement, gashing wound, and the rush move from guest 666.

(Immolation): 

“If I am to live, the flame must consume me… and I will rise from it.”

cooldown: 10 seconds. Requires a charge for use.

Description: after 0.5s of windup, ember stabs himself causing a massive explosion that deals 40 damage to him and inflicts him with burning I for 4 seconds. If a killer is close enough to ember while he uses this ability, they will be knocked away and stunned for 1.5s seconds, taking 30 damage in the process. Ember also gains speed I for 5 second after use but also weakness V for 8 seconds. In the location Ember used this ability, a small area of fire will linger for 8 seconds inflicting burning I and slowness I on anything that enters (yes even survivors). After the use of this move, ember also gains 1 stack of witherblade.

Intended playstyle: he’s a snowball survivor. The main inspiration behind this survivor is that when the slasher update rolled around two time was literally completely gutted. His so called “hitbox fixes” made trickstabbing pretty much impossible. He was in my opinion the most skilled survivor so I drafted up a concept for what I think is the most rewarding but skill based survivor. His goal is simply to just run up to the killer and help survivors via landing severance. Then he runs off to escape and use erasure before using immolation. He repeats this process surviving the killer each time since literally 2 hits kill him unless he has high erasure. Once he has high witherblade, the killer suffers as a skilled ember can stun them for like 20s.

Lore: so, I always feel like Taph could have so much more potential with his lore, so with this, I hope to give him an expansion on this. I have another killer concept that ties these two together hopefully coming soon :3 Long ago, Ember existed inside a now-lost Roblox game. An old adventure world built in that charming, nostalgic style only early Roblox could capture. He wasn’t a hero or a chosen one; he was simply an NPC within a small cult devoted to “the Flame,” the sacred heart of their world.

But everything changed the day the game’s creator deleted his account. With the owner gone, the world could no longer stay online. Builderman had recently begun relying on a creature unintentionally created by Taph — a living demolition engine called The Core to help erase old games quickly and efficiently. The Core was sent to dismantle Ember’s dying world, burning everything it touched with a dissolving, erasure-like flame.

When Ember came into contact with those flames, something impossible happened. The fire didn’t destroy him. It made him aware. The erasure flame ate through his body, stripping away the boundaries of what he was supposed to be, but Ember refused to let himself be forgotten. Through sheer willpower, he survived the destruction, merging with the very fire meant to eliminate him. His body twisted into white-blue flames and unstable essence, a being held together only by stubborn, agonizing determination.

Before his world fully vanished, Ember seized the “Hero’s Weapon” from his game’s scripted questline, desperately attempting to strike back at The Core. When the blade touched the entity, the weapon was corrupted and reborn as the Oblivion Blade, inheriting the same erasure power that devoured the world. Ember alone could wield it, because he was already fused with the flame that created it.

One strike from the Oblivion Blade was all it took. The Core glitched, buckled, and collapsed into bugs, forced to return to Builderman, malfunctioning and unable to continue its work. (The consequences… well, that’s a story for when The Core gets revealed. Next weeks killer…?)

Now, Ember stood alone in the ruins of his game, the last surviving fragment. Only his small altar and the strange erasure-flames remained. In his loneliness, he began to believe these flames were his cult’s sacred fire, surviving as he had.

With no physical body left, Ember spent uncounted time training himself to endure the torment of the flames that made him. He learned to heal, reshape, and sustain himself through rituals remembered from his cult, feeding what little “flesh” he had to the fire in order to remain whole. Over time he mastered his new abilities, infusing both the Oblivion Blade and his dagger with the same consuming energy.

Frailty became strength. Pain became power.
And all that remained of his world became his purpose.

Eventually, Ember cast himself into the edge of existence, leaving the wreckage of his forgotten home behind in search of the core again, killing himself. Now, in the Forsaken realm, he hunts for the truth of the flame, seeking the creature he calls “the beast who stole our sacred fire.”

He wanders not for revenge alone, but to protect others from the same fate his own world suffered choosing to strike down the killers.

Achievements: 
milestone I-IV: same as usual.
Oncoming traffic: stun the killer with oblivion blade starting from 50 or more studs away.
Flame and flesh: use immolation more than 6 times in 1 game.
Withered hearts: As Ember kill the killer 30 times.

Skins: 
Cultist ($200): gives ember his old cultist outfit. So he has a full robe and hood and his dagger gets switched to an old one. Oblivion blade has no effect and is just a broadsword. 

Skeleflame ($400): has a skeleton within the flame which has turned black and purple

Dullahan: ($600): his head turns into a pumpkin with a flame in it. All explosion also play a cackling sound when used. His sword is replaced with a staff with a pumpkin on it.

underground ($600): it’s ember but with Grillby’s outfit and has his glasses.
Fine ($900): turns into the “this is fine” dog. Immolation is just drinking coffee
Angel of flame ($1000): Ember wears an angelic white robe instead of his regular outfit. His blade is now white instead and he has 2 wings made of fire. All fire is now white also.

Ogre ($1300): just turns him straight up into shrek. All the flame effects are replaced with green swamp effects. His oblivion blade is now a wooden stick while his dagger is a smaller stick. Immolation becomes a literal fart and so does erasure =-= when he goes to use oblivion blade all stars begins to play.

Wishbearer ($1500): okay a little backstory on this. I have a concepted story for this original world and in it are these different wishes that are basically powers if I had to explain it in the simplest way. One guy has an ability born from his wish called “hot ice” which I decided to use as the base of this skin.  Ember’s entire body switches to a guy wearing crystalline armor with shards jutting out. His face is covered by a bandanna and he gains hair which looks light blue and white with a few streaks of orange. Instead of the oblivion blade he has an ice spear and his dagger is also now white. With every step he leaves a path of small ice which after 3 seconds turns to steam. All of the explosions and fire pools he makes are reskinned to be ice instead with ice spikes jutting out the ground . With severance instead of just jabbing forwards he summons a wild mass of jutting ice crystals to stab forwards before they all eventually turn to steam. Mmmm

The anomaly ($1800): changes the skin to that of glitchtale chara with flames surrounding them. Severance is replaced with a slash that if it hits the killer, causes a 99999 dmg hit effect to come up. If it’s a miss it’ll say miss. Regardless it’ll do the animation undertake uses for slashing. Erasure causes chara to open her menu to find items, eating a random one. Oblivion blade does the same animation for ember but has the flowey “that’s a wonderful idea!” Sound play. Also the knife is replaced. All the fire is also now red and black glitch particles and the path that is traveled leaves a black and red version of basically the annihilation John Doe skin trail. Immolation is the player opening the reset option and slamming onto it. Custom LMS vs. Disbelief

Milestone I: Ember’s outfit is slightly charred now with black spots and maybe even some burned parts. Oblivion blade gains a few orange cracks on it that glow slightly. Also ember smokes a little now. Like there’s a black foggy effect around him slightly. Also the dagger has an orange tip on it now. Animation for immolation now also leaves small embers in that area for a short period of time. 

Milestone II: ember’s body grows brighter. He gains a cape that’s still burned like his clothes. The oblivion blade gains some glitchy red particles around it with a little more detail on the blade itself too. Also the cracks on the blade get brighter. The dagger is now on fire with an orange flame. His adventuring outfit becomes slightly more intricate starting to look more like a cultists uniform.

Milestone III: Ember gains shoulder plates that are made of black stone and have the orange cracks on them. The rest of his body is covered in his outfit that has even more intricate designs. His body is now made of white flames while his cape gains red streaks all over it. The dagger now has blue flames around it. The rest of ember’s body is glitching too. Also he gains a cultist hood over his head while his head seems to begin to manifest with no features.

Milestone IV: Ember’s cape is now jagged at the ends and his clothes are glowing and burning. Each one of his steps leaves a small flame for 2 seconds turns to smoke. The rest of his body is mostly covered in armor but he still has his cultist like outfit underneath. His entire body turns into a combination of white and blue fire. His face has manifested on his head but it has no eyes or mouth. The mouth is covered by a bandana. The hood gains strange glowing orange symbols. Black and orange crystals protrude from around his outfit too. There’s even some glowing flowers growing. The oblivion blade is decorated in crystals and now glows with the cracks and is surrounded by glitchy particles. Dagger is the same. All explosion animations also cause crystals to burst out of the ground and flowers made of fire to bloom there for a couple seconds. The dagger also has small rocks orbiting around it.  Using oblivion blade also chases ember to seem to flicker in and out. 

Driving in my caaaar (oncoming traffic achievement): turns into asgore lmao. When oblivion blade is used he gets into a car instead and starts speeding forwards. Pressing the move again causes the car to explode. All hit boxes are the same. Severance instead causes a small car to appear infront of the player and ram forwards. Erasure is just drinking a beer. Immolation is a car that falls onto the skin and explodes. 

Borrowed time (withered hearts achievement): this skin takes HEAVY inspiration from the lore of two time and Heathcliff from limbus company. This character and the associated Eternity skin for core are both from the same wish world as hot ice. So there once were these two people, one named Caelum and the other named Ashen. The story takes place after a massive star-like planet fell into earth giving wish-based abilities to the people on earth. That’s the basic summary there’s a lot more about these wishes but the most you gotta know is that. Ashen and Caelum were two kids that lost their parents during the impact and were taken in by a scientist like group. They bonded together while the adults pretty much just committed multiple human rights violations trying to figure out and understand the wishes. Now I’m not gonna bore you with all the details but the two got close and eventually were put into an experiment where the lab people would attempt to finally create their own wish. Through this time Caelum had been manipulated by the scientists to seek the “greater good” with these wishes as almost a god like entity (this is funny because it’s like the flipped version of ember’s lore where this time ember’s skin isn’t the cultist). For the “greater good” Caelum is forced to sacrifice the thing he loves most which they think will create a wish. Knowing that it’s Ashen, Caelum goes through with it at this point thinking the wish is worth it. Ashen hears about this plan and decides not to intervene. She was already dying from some weird allergy to the original stars sort of “wish” aura thing which nobody knew about and decides that seeing Caelum’s determination, that she wants her last moment to be giving herself to him. Caelum stabs Ashen in the back with a crude dagger killing her as she smiles in his arms. After the act, Ember in a sort of moment of clarity realizes what he had done. No wish was also made so it was pointless. With his pure rage and anguish he does manifest a wish. “Don’t fade—don’t fade, don’t fade, DON’T FADE! If the world takes you, then I’ll MAKE it remember you! I wish you’d never stop burning in it!”(“I wish she would stay, burning in the world until nothing else remained.”) and so his he gains the ability to conjure flames that last forever and can set any object on fire, adopting the name Eternal flame and burning the facility to the ground. (Full description of his ability is: (The user may conjure projectiles of fire that after hitting an enemy, permanently set them on fire. This effect cannot be canceled and lasts until the wish disappears (basically never). This flame does not produce sparks and only spreads through direct contact. User may also appear in any flame they had set previously.) with the world never doing anything for him he vows to set everything ablaze, going on a hunt to kill every other wish bearer or person that crosses his path. Years and years later another wish user dies and has their wish bottle dropped near the initial lab place where the one thing that remained was the untouched corpse of Ashen. From the wish Ashen is awoken and gains the ability to live for just 1 hour. With Eternal Flame also there, Ashen sees what he has become and confronts him only for Calleum, now totally gone, to attack Ashen. Ashen’s hope for Caelum to change grants her a blade able to pierce Caelum. With pure determination (and from not even being technically human anymore as they’re a memory), the two battle to the death with Caelum especially now wanting Ashen dead. Okay that’s the very short summary of it but onto the actual skin description. Ashen’s body is replaced with a more darkish charcoal looking body. Parts of her body are cracked and emanate black and white sparks along with glowing purple and orange while pulsing. Her entire body is also covered in white and black flames. The blade is replaced with a massive magma coated orange broadsword that drips and leaves a small and short lasting magma trail. There are some black cracks on it though. Her hair is long and her face looks calm. The outfit is replaced with black stone plated armor with a robe under it with many golden sigils all across it. Parts of the robe flicker in and out with glitchy particles. Her body is also slightly transparent. Half of embers face is her glowing skull while the other is her regular face. Both her eyes glow faintly though. Above her head is a shattered halo made of glasslike particles. She also has wings made of ash on her. She also has a cape that’s heavily burnt and charred. The hourglass has been replaced with a destroyed version that emanates orange light. Wrapped around her arms are golden chains. A silver hourglass charm also dangles around her neck. Dagger is replaced with a black curved version that looks slightly more like a sickle. It’s black and looks like it’s made of ash while glowing a little orange. Upon using immolation for the first time, the Ashen’s wings grow and spread, before changing into a glowing white more crystal-like one. they also gain a crown made of crystals. Severance switches to a fire slash instead of a stab. It does a wide swing and leaves a fiery effect. If it hits something then it will cause a miniature explosion. Erasure makes Ember create a circle on the floor with his dagger and cutting himself to bleed onto the ground. Then, he stomps causing the circle to glow orange and be set ablaze before eventually fading out. Oblivion blade is given extra effects as the glide causes sparks to burst from the ground. Immolation is the same though. The player for oblivion blade has her do two flips backwards instead of the jump before she jumps forwards with the ground under hear when she jumps and glides being given a fiery explosion effect. The auto ending has her jump and do a front flip to smash the blade into the ground.

1p115vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/1p115vf/looking_to_connect_with_victoria_restaurant/,Looking to connect with Victoria restaurant owners for a pilot (local startup),"Hey folks,

I’m a Victoria local working on a small software startup called TableTapp, and I’m hoping the community here might be able to point me in the right direction.

Basically, I’ve noticed (like everyone else) that restaurants are *really* stretched thin right now with staff shortages, rising labour costs, and long waits for guests. I’ve been building a simple tool that tries to take a bit of pressure off:

Customers scan a QR code on the table → see a live menu → order → and pay at the end of the meal.

(More info can be found on our website: [TableTapp](http://tabletapp.ca))

The development process for the product is almost done. I’m at the stage where I really need real-world feedback from actual restaurant environments. I’m looking for 1-2 restaurants in Victoria that’d be open to trying it out (totally free pilot, no strings attached). Just honest feedback on what works, what sucks, and what needs to be changed.

To be clear:

* I’m *not* selling anything.
* I don’t expect restaurants to overhaul their systems, I just want to see if this helps in even a small way.
* I’m totally flexible and willing to customize things to fit their flow.

I'm not going to hurt you. You're probably not going to hurt me. We'll just slowly disappoint each other in small ways until one of us stops responding or we get hitched. Those are the options.

Location: ★★★★★

Occupies the prime viewing spot along Yulong River, with karst peaks reflecting in the water visible right outside your window. Bamboo raft dock is just steps away, making it the geographical center of Yangshuo's landscapes. Cross the bridge to reach the Yulong River walking trail.

Facilities: ★★★☆

Guest rooms embody Eastern wabi-sabi aesthetics, with Acqua di Parma toiletries adding sophistication. However, an odd odor lingers in the lobby, suggesting room for improvement in the scent diffusion system.

Dining Experience: ★★★☆

The English afternoon tea is a delightful surprise, featuring pour-over coffee, fresh juices, nuts, and cakes to soothe travel fatigue. While breakfast portions are generous, the fixed menu over two consecutive days feels somewhat perfunctory and lacks distinctive flair.

Service Level: ★★★

Front desk service varies significantly in both attitude and competence; some staff members' professionalism doesn't align with the property's premium positioning.

Value for Money: ★★★

With peak-season rates exceeding ¥3000 per night, this feels less like lodging and more like paying a premium for unparalleled views. We recommend reserving a view room for just one night to fully appreciate the scenery.

II. Yuyuan Jingshe Hotel (Family-Friendly Choice) Images 5-9

Location: ★★★★

Though slightly removed from prime waterfront areas, it boasts an exclusive 8,000㎡ lakeside lawn forming its own ecological kingdom. The ink-wash scenery in morning mist is equally captivating.

Family Amenities: ★★★★★

Features a children's activity center, swimming pool, and complimentary outdoor toys including fishing gear, sand toys, and bubble guns. The morning osprey interaction is a delightful bonus.

Hardware Facilities: ★★★

While lacking the high-end finishes of luxury hotels, the facilities are adequate, with floor-to-ceiling windows offering perfect views.

Dining Services: ★★★★

Buffet breakfast offers decent variety, with the freshly cooked rice noodle station adding a lively, homey touch.

Value for Money: ★★★★☆

The average rate of ¥1,500 per night aligns well with the extensive amenities, making it ideal for family vacations that truly deliver an “all-inclusive” experience.

【Hotels Encountered Along the Journey】

1. Riverside Resort: Also occupies a prime location along the Yulong River. This expansive property suits travelers seeking a secluded retreat.
2. Paradise Hotel: A social hub curated by foreign owners, attracting more international guests. Facilities are somewhat dated but the location is prime, very close to Xishijinshe.

In today’s busy lifestyle, plaque, tartar, and stains build up quickly—even if you brush and floss daily. That’s why [professional teeth cleaning service in Jaipur](https://manglamdentalhospital.com/teeth-cleanings-in-jaipur) has become an essential dental requirement for people of all ages.

Among the top dental clinics in the city, Manglam Dental Hospital stands out as one of the most trusted destinations for cleanings, smile makeover services, and advanced dental treatments.

# ⭐ Why Teeth Cleaning is Important

Teeth cleaning is not just a cosmetic procedure—it is a preventive treatment that protects you from serious dental issues like gum infections, tooth decay, bad breath, and bone loss. Over time, bacteria harden into tartar, which only professional cleaning tools can remove.

Regular cleaning also supports procedures like:

* Root Canal Treatment in Jaipur
* Best Dental Implant Service in Jaipur
* Crown and Bridge Treatment in Jaipur
* Veneers Treatment in Jaipur
* Cosmetic Dentistry in Jaipur

When your gums and teeth stay disease-free, every other dental treatment becomes smoother, faster, and more effective.

# ⭐ Teeth Cleaning Cost in Jaipur

The teeth cleaning cost in Jaipur depends on the level of cleaning required, the technology used, and your oral condition. Below is a general price overview:

# ✔ Basic Cleaning (Scaling + Polishing)

# ⭐ Benefits of Professional Teeth Cleaning

Patients often underestimate teeth cleaning, but the benefits are significant:

# ✔ Prevents Gum Diseases

Deep cleaning removes harmful bacteria responsible for bleeding gums and infections.

# ✔ Eliminates Bad Breath

Tartar and plaque buildup are major causes of bad breath; cleaning restores freshness.

# ✔ Enhances Smile Appearance

Polishing removes stains caused by tea, coffee, smoking, and spices.

# ✔ Supports Cosmetic Treatments

Before procedures like veneers, bonding, or [teeth whitening](https://manglamdentalhospital.com/teeth-whitening-in-jaipur), cleaning prepares teeth for better results.

# ✔ Reduces Future Dental Costs

Regular cleaning prevents expensive treatments like surgical gum therapy or implants.

# ⭐ Who Needs Teeth Cleaning?

Everyone benefits from cleaning, but certain groups need it more:

* Smokers
* Tea/coffee drinkers
* People with gum bleeding
* Those who have crooked teeth (harder to clean at home)
* People wearing braces or Invisalign
* Diabetic patients
* Patients with mouth infections

If you experience sensitive gums, bad breath, or visible tartar, visit Manglam Dental Hospital for a complete dental check-up.

# ⭐ How Often Should You Get Teeth Cleaning Done?

Most dental experts recommend cleaning once every 6 months.

However, if you have gum disease or heavy tartar, you may need cleaning every 3–4 months. Our dentists create personalized plans based on your oral condition.

# ⭐ Teeth Cleaning vs Teeth Whitening – What’s the Difference?

Many patients confuse cleaning with whitening, but both are different procedures:

# 🦷 Teeth Cleaning

* Removes tartar, plaque, and bacteria
* Improves gum health
* Prevents bad breath
* Protects teeth from decay

# ✨ Teeth Whitening

* Lightens tooth shade
* Removes deep stains
* Improves smile aesthetics
* Often done after cleaning

For whitening, Manglam Dental Hospital offers the Best Teeth Whitening Service in Jaipur, using safe and long-lasting whitening techniques.

# ⭐ Best Clinics for Teeth Cleaning in Jaipur

While there are several clinics in Jaipur, Manglam Dental Hospital is widely recognized for:

* Advanced cleaning technology
* Experienced team
* Comprehensive dental services
* Patient-friendly pricing
* Premium hygiene standards

Patients from Mansarovar, Vaishali Nagar, Sanganer, Tonk Road, and nearby areas visit us for world-class dental care.

# ⭐ Why Choose a Professional Clinic Instead of Home Remedies?

Home remedies like salt, lemon, charcoal, and baking soda may clean the surface but cannot remove tartar. Improper use can even damage enamel permanently.

Only a professional can:

* Remove tartar safely
* Clean deep gum pockets
* Detect early signs of disease
* Prevent future complications

# ⭐ Aftercare Tips for Long-Lasting Results

Follow these tips after cleaning for long-term oral health:

* Brush twice daily using a soft-bristle toothbrush
* Use mouthwash to prevent bacterial growth
* Floss regularly
* Avoid smoking and tobacco
* Rinse after tea, coffee, or sweets
* Get dental check-ups every 6 months

# Conclusion

Teeth cleaning is a simple, effective, and essential procedure for maintaining long-term dental health. Whether you want to protect your gums, eliminate bad breath, or enhance your smile before cosmetic treatments, professional cleaning is the perfect solution.

After having seen the pass result on my score report a few minutes ago, I took a few moments to reflect back on the journey that I undertook to reach this endpoint and all praises to the one above, for I had no strength of my own.

Background - IMG, decent med school education, decided on USMLE a bit later than others and booked eligibility period during difficult rotations (very bad/unconventional move but we will see what went my way)

Started prep with UWorld and FA as primary knowledge resources with NBME/Free120 as my mile markers to note progress. Dirty Medicine is the single greatest resource on youtube for Step 1 (MARK MY WORDS). Mehlman HY PDFs became my secondary content enforcers after FA.

Total time devoted - 2.5-3 months as I had busy work schedule with a bunch of mental health struggles. Dedicated period - I would say 10-14 days (all a blur honestly).

Reached up to 70 percent on UWorld with an average of 58 percent correct (not stellar but got the job done)

NBME - 26: First ever NBME I gave at the start of prep - 50% (med school knowledge ftw)

NBME - 27: Skipped

NBME 28 - 56% (Not a big jump but still an improvement) - one month to my exam

NBME 29 - Skipped (Saw that form 33 was released so decided to do the more recent ones)

NBME 30 - 58% (3 weeks to my exam) - Considered postponing exam in view of poor scores but kept up with it because I had faith

NBME 31 - 66% (About 2 weeks to my exam date) - Self doubt crept in, but riding on faith

NBME 32 - 68% (7 days before exam) - Major win for me and faith shot up

NBME 33 - 70%(4 days before exam) - Shocked but had to control emotions and keep pushing

New Free 120 - 75% in first two blocks (3 days before exam) - Major boost to my confidence and knew I was ready - Could not solve 3rd block as it kept logging me out due to server / net issues but figrued I will just speedrun through explanation on youtube.

Last 2 days - Fight or Flight response, barely any sleep even though I knew I had to get in sleep. Revised all NBME incorrects and HY Arrows/images/Neuro PDFs

D-Day (10/24/25) - Woke up, prayed, had food packed from before including 1.5L water, coffee, bananas, protein bars, ready made sandwhiches and 2 cans of celsius drink. Reached the exam centre 45 minutes in advance. Kudos to the prometric centre guys as they made me feel so comfortable throughout the entire process and treated me very respectfully and made sure to make me feel relaxed during my break times.

Test taking strategy on D-Day - I did 3 blocks f/b 10 minutes break then 2 blocks followed by 15 mintes break and then 5 minutes of break in between my last 2 blocks. The food barely helped, it was the adrenaline rush that kept me going and my raw faith in God. Came out of the centre absolutely devasted and devoid of any energy. Went shopping straight and made dinner plans with a friend. Anxiously waited for this and it was delivered.

One advice to everyone out here. Always believe in your capabilities. If I can do it, so can everyone here on the platform. Happy testing and may God bless us all!

Looking for a soul who wants a real connection and we can see where this goes. Hopefully towards a more sweet way.

If you are up for a serious connection let's connect. ",2,1763535807.0,IntrovertsChat,1,1.0,False

1p10rjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazingStories/comments/1p10rjt/today_was_actually_insane_at_work_and_i_almost/,Today was actually insane at work and I almost cried but… something wild happened,"Okay sooo… I had a DAY today lol.

I work a super normal 9–5, nothing fancy, and I swear the universe woke up and chose violence the moment I walked into the office.

First thing I see?  
A Slack from my boss like:

“Hey, can you redo the client report? Need it ASAP.”

ASAP??? Girl, I literally just sat down. My coat is still on my damn chair.

And the report??  
I had already worked on it forever.  
I wanted to scream.

Anyway, I started grinding — like full goblin mode.  
Hair in a messy bun, sad-ass coffee beside me, headphones in, ignoring everyone like they were NPCs.

People around me were laughing, eating snacks, going for lunch…  
and I’m just sitting there like a raccoon trying to finish a dissertation.

The report kept looking wrong.  
Numbers off.  
Charts ugly.  
Formatting fighting for its life.

By 2:30 PM I swear I could feel the migraine forming behind my eyeballs.  
I had this moment where I was like:

“Wow okay I actually suck. Maybe I shouldn’t be here.”

(Yes, I had a mini identity crisis at my desk. It’s fine.)

But then I was like,  
“Okay girl. One more hour. Just TRY. Don’t flop today.”

So I went feral on that report.  
Cleaned the charts.  
Fixed all the stupid data issues.  
Reworded half the thing.  
Basically rebuilt it from scratch like the unhinged queen I am.

Finally sent it.  
And immediately regretted my entire life.

Boss calls me 10 minutes later and my stomach DROPPED.  
I literally thought I was about to get roasted alive.

But she goes:

“This is actually amazing. Huge improvement. I’m putting you in for the quarterly performance bonus.”

I’m like:  
“…Me?”  
Because surely she meant someone else.

But nope. Me.  
The girl who almost cried into her iced coffee.

So yeah.  
Today taught me something kinda cute:

Sometimes you think you’re failing,  
but really you’re just leveling up in hard mode.

Anyway, if you’re having a shitty workday — same.  
But also, don’t give up.

1p10qsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1p10qsz/my_boyfriend_now_ex_went_religious_fast/,My (Boyfriend) now ex went religious fast,"Hello everyone, over the past week I’ve been going through a very weird breakup. Before I get to the actual break up, I need to give some back story. So August of 2024 my boyfriend and I broke up of 2 1/2 years because he wanted to go be with other people. I was heart broken, it took me 3 months to start to feel normal. Around December I started to feel better and guess who came back, he did. I choose to ignore him until late March of 2025. The only reason I respond was because we went to the same gym and it was hard trying to work out while him being there. We met for coffee and caught up and it ended up in us getting back together at the end of April. He ended sleeping with 4 people while we were apart and it was definitely hard on me mentally. Either way, he was so excited to have me back and we worked on communication (well at least I thought). Everything was going really well up until this October. To start this all off here’s so back info, my bf (ex) was always religious, his family just never really participated in the church but he was a believer. Recently he started attending church with his friend who had already been attending for a while. Then he began attending regularly, which I genuinely have no issue with, he seemed happy and that made me happy. Personally religion is not something for me, I wasn’t raised in it but I want put it out there that I have no issues with it, I do see lots of positives in it but it’s just not for me. Well at first I thought he was just excited to be apart of it and I didn’t think anything of it. But it started to get a little weird because back in September he was still doing normal things like he’d still have drinks with friends, play video games and tmi but we were regularly intimate (he always seemed very into it). Well then October came and it felt like he became a completely different person, he stopped drinking, rarely playing video games and this is point is the main reason I ended the relationship. He never told me he went celibate… he went for like 3-4 weeks without telling me. He also would turn away from me when id change and it really hurt me in those moments because I had no idea why. Mind you he was still sweet to me and still had the same humour but these things changed and I felt God made it into lots of conversations when he didn’t really need to. Once again I am not against religion. Too fast forward, I voiced with him how I was upset that he never told me he went celibate and it he said was “fearful”. I understand it’s hard to talk to someone but this was huge and I gave him so many chances to speak to me, the main reason we got back together was because he agreed to talk to me about things (I brought up the lack of intimacy and that’s when he told me). We decided to take a few days a part and then discuss the issue more. So I arrived at his house and he started, he apologized for not telling me and then showed me his baptizing video and I explained how I was proud of him and seeing him so happy made me happy (even though he doesn’t seem as happy as he used too) . The only thing is he wanted me to convert and that’s when I had my answer, I told him maybe he needs someone who will do that stuff with him. He ended breaking down saying “I prayed and prayed and prayed it would be you”. I was confused by that because it could be me, but now it’s because I’m not religious. The breakup was awful, he kept saying things like “I feel like I’m losing a part of me” and other things. Anyways we took a few days a part until we exchanged things. During that time, I tried to think of anyway to make it work, I supported him and I showed excitement when he’d tell me about church, or when we’d be in bed, he’d be reading the bible, it never bugged me. I just thought if he was happy it was fine. When we met up it was so odd, he was saying things like “I just went to kiss you there” “I just want to poke your face”. Yet he wasn’t willing to make it work in any way. It was either I convert or not. But all of this happened in a MONTH. I feel so heart broken, I spent days trying to find a way to work around it or even considering converting, I genuinely love him so much but i can’t lie my whole life saying I’m religious when im not. I even told him that I was okay if my kids were religious because I really just want them to be happy and healthy. Another big thing that caught me off guard was when he started talking about how is one friend still drinks, vapes and smokes . Yet he just stopped doing all that stuff a month ago, but he was judging his friend for it??? I told him that “he’s still young”.  But he said he could be “doing better”. He also brought up the Rapture…it wasn’t weird but it was just shocking. He has always followed what his friends are doing and I don’t know if this is one of these things. But I’m so sad and confused, he was completely normal and happy with me a month ago, I just don’t understand. He talked about how much he loved me and how much he’s gonna miss me when we broke up. But I just don’t get why he didn’t even try to think of a way to make it work, he’s never had an issue of me not being Christian. Many of my friends have said he’s on a high right now and will probably come back but I don’t even know. I just feel so sad, why not fight for me? What did I do? I’m being so honest when this happened within a month and he never told me he went celibate until I brought it up. He also said God forgave him for all these things he did and he felt he was rebirth by Christ himself. It hurt when he said God forgave him when I was the one who worked really hard to forgive him for the things he did in our last relationship. Sorry to anyone reading this, it goes all over the place. But thank you for listening and if you have any advice or just ways to help me move on please let me know. (We were planning on staying in contact but I stopped it already because in his snaps he seemed so happy and it hurt me) ",0,1763535654.0,Advice,2,0.5,False
1p10q6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SirLoinstakes/comments/1p10q6b/xi_spicy_warning_continued/,XI (spicy warning continued),"Eochu awoke in the morning to find it a good bit brighter than he usually woke up to.  He thought to himself *must have slept in a bit.*
He laid there a bit longer, appreciating the vision that was her asleep next to him.  Peaceful and content, with the brunette curls cascading around her.  Yeah he could get used to waking up to this, but nature calls, so slipped out of bed and got up to go take a leak. 

He got dressed and handled his business, checking on the horses while he was out there.  On his way back in he grabbed the bags from where he’d dropped them the night before.  Then he stoked the fire and started a pot of coffee.

Aisling had begun to stir now.  He watched as she awoke with a yawn, then sat up in the bed and stretched.  As she did his cloak slid down revealing her beautiful breasts.  He had to suppress the urge to jump back into bed, but it reminded him of the night before.

“Good morning beautiful” he said as she got up and bent over to retrieve her dress.  *fucking hell, now that is an sight* he thought but didn’t say out loud.
She pulled the sky blue silk inner slip over her head without bothering to with the red velvet portion other than to pull the gold broach off of it.  
He poured them both a cup of coffee and set it on the table.
She walked over to her coffee cup, opened the broach, revealing it to be a little locket with a white powdery substance inside.
She took her pinky finger, scraped up some of the powder in her finger nail and tapped on the rim it into her coffee.

“No offense meant, but how is it you fled for your life with nothing but the clothes on your back, not even any shoes, but you’ve got birth control medicine with you?” 

Aisling replied “none taken, but for an unmarried woman of the nobility living around Royal courts and traveling alone, some precautions are as necessary as having guards.”

She took a sip and continued “I haven’t had much cause to use it but I got it from an apothecary just in case and have always kept it with me.”  

Eochu responded “makes sense I reckon, If I’ve got pants on then I’ve at least got a good knife.”
“Speaking of clothes and precautions, I got you a few surprises yesterday when I picked up our provisions. We also have some revelations and arrangements to discuss.” 

Eochu pulled out the bag with the shoes and the milk maid dress and handed it over with a grin and an “I hope they fit.”

Aisling’s face lit up with the presents.  She said “they’re lovely!!  I can tweak it if I need to, I saw some needle & thread in a cupboard when I was cleaning.” 

Eochu explained, “I heard there were some men poking around inquiring about a brunette woman that wasn’t local.  If they’d been given a good description of you that red velvet dress sticks out.”  

Aisling said “that makes sense, did they say anything else about these men?”

“The lady said they wore grey cloaks with a Raven’s head embroidery”

Aisling gasped “that’s Lord McSweeney’s goons! That bastard is a conniving snake”

Eochu decided it was time to lay his cards on the table.  “I’d figured we could pretend you were my woman.  People are a little less likely to poke around, be inquisitive or interfere with a claimed woman. A little disguise, a little misdirection could help me protect you. But I’m having second thoughts.”

Aisling looked up at him confused and started to deflate immediately  “you are? You won’t protect me? What kind of second thoughts?” 

That look she gave him made his blood rise, he reached out and pulled her into his chest and his voice took on a deep low growl “I don’t think I can pretend.”  He kissed her then, long and hard, the kind of kiss that telegraphs the intensity behind it.

When their lips parted she gazed up at him whispered “Yes Sir, I’m yours Eochu Daghda”

He carried her back to bed right then, pulled the blue silk slip over her head and shed his own clothes with a quickness.  She laid back and spread her thighs making a place for him immediately, he knelt between her legs she was already wet and her pussy blossomed open. Without preamble he positioned himself at her entrance and entered her with one sooth stroke all the way to the hilt.  She reached up and clasped her hands behind his neck, pulling him down to her and kissed him passionately.  He rocked up on his arms, withdrew part way and rolled his hips into her.  She pulled her knees back even further, opening herself for him as far as she could.  He found his rhythm and began piston-ing in and out of her with intensity.  She began to quiver with her first orgasm but he drove on right through it.  Aisling cried out “YES! FUCK ME, Eochu… fucking claim me! ….Make me yours!”  That spurred him on like a race horse going for broke, he fucked her good and deep and hard, she gushed around his cock, her toes scrunched up there by his shoulders, he drove on until she was a quivering mess beneath him and when he could hold back no more he sunk to the hilt one last time with a powerful grunt and buried his load deep inside her.

Then he collapsed, just barely managing to roll to one side and not crush her.  They rested there a while, she’d snuggled and backed up in to him staking her spot as little spoon.  He held her, basking in the afterglow.  

Then they got up and she said she’d like to wash up and try on her new dress.  He described a spot down the creek by a willow tree that had a little pool with a sandy bottom and a convenient rock to sit on.  Eochu told her he should probably keep watch as he dug out the rag and lye soap from his pack.

Aisling slipped on her new shoes and marveled that he’d got a pair that fit so well.  Then headed out the door with the milkmaid dress in hand, wearing nothing but her new shoes.

Eochu had just pulled on his pants and belt with knife & hatchet when she went out the door.  Suddenly he was scrambling after her grabbing his bow & quiver as he went.  He found himself half dressed trying to catchup, watching her naked ass jiggle as she skipped all the way to the creek.  

She found the spot by the willow tree & paused at the bank just long enough to kick off her shoes before wading right in. 

Eochu caught up spent a few minutes scanning the surroundings and listening to the forest beyond.  Nothing triggered his instinct for immediate danger so he set his bow, quiver and tool belt where it’d be close at hand, shucked his pants and joined her.   They passed the rag and soap back & forth between them.  Eochu helped her wash all the parts she couldn’t reach and maybe spent a little longer than absolutely necessary double checking that she thoroughly washed a few others.  
He climbed out first and set on the rock to dry.  It was mid day and really pleasant out.
She was taking her time enjoying herself and he certainly didn’t mind the view.

When she was done she sat on the rock next to him and air dried until she could put on her new shoes.  They headed back up to the cabin and he let her lead the way.

She went in to try on her new dress and make alterations as necessary.  He grabbed up the halters & went on to the meadow to check on the horses.  

He found both easy enough, the little mare was still hobbled so he removed them and haltered her up.  He led the pretty little bay mare back and the stud followed right along.

At the hitching post he wiped both horses down & checked their feet, then saddled them up.

By the time he was through Aisling came out the door.  She was glowing in her new dress and when she saw him looking she twirled around with a “well, what do you think?”

Smiling he replied “You look ravishing my dear” and it was the truth if he’d ever told it.

Just then Aisling noticed the little bay mare and asked “you got new horse?”

Eochu answered “nope… YOU got a new horse.  She’s all yours….Didn’t you know, good girls get presents!” 

Aisling practically jumped for joy and exclaimed “oh Daghda, she’s beautiful!” 
Aisling walked up and reached out to pet her.  The little bay mare nuzzled Aisling right away.

I went to this Starbucks and saw this worker I had never seen before. His bubbly energy had me thinking about him for days till I went back in to see him again. I have a very unique name and the first time I told him my name he complemented it and said it was a beautiful name. The next time I saw him he remembered my name and the conversation we had the time before. Then for the first time I went into the actual cafe, he took my order and then he remembered me again. The next time I went in he and his coworker noticed me and said my name excitedly. That same visit he kept sneaking glances at me and when he handed me my coffee he wrote a whole sentence on my cup again having to do with my name. That same day I went up to ask for water and his coworker sounded like she was teasing him and asked **him** to make my water. After he handed me the water my friend who was with me said that he made a knowing/excited face to that same coworker. I went in today and I didn't see him for the first about 30 minutes of my visit, then out of nowhere he came from the back and said my name from behind the counter. This visit was also full of sneaky little glances at each other. Then I walked up to order another item and he took my order, he was distracted while doing so and he didn't give me the right change. Immediately he noticed and took out his **own** wallet and tried to give me the missing change. I didn't take it and told him to keep it as a tip, he hesitated but said ok and thank you. Then when he called me to get my order he asked if I needed anything else like water. I always get water after I get my second order and he remembered that. For the name on the order sticker he spelled my name in an exaggerated way the same way he says it out loud. 

I think he's just being nice and has great costumer service but my mind and friends tell me otherwise. ",1,1763535552.0,Crushes,2,1.0,False

Mentally checked out at least 2, probably in cruise control for 3.

And lying flat quite literally. I often make a coffee and breakfast, and work from my laptop in bed until at least 11am. Later on I might swap between the couch or an ad-hoc work station I've set up. We only have room for one proper work station and if my partner is WFH that goes to her, and I'm not about to invest in another.

I often take 1.5-2 hour lunches and sometimes nap for 15 mins at like 2pm.

I'm in this position now where I'm not a grunt, but I'm not a middle or general manager, but I do manage a few people. It affords me this ability to kinda hide out as long as I'm responsive to everyone/thing which I am.

I do everything that comes my way in a timely fashion, but here's the thing, I'm not really doing more than the bare minimum or working up for extra management duties, or working down for more grunt work. There is no incentive to because the business is somewhat flailing and I'm at the end of my rope in terms of growth here.

I also stopped drinking the kool aid as we tend to ham-fistedly jump from one half-baked project to another and I've stopped buying in. Just playing the game.

Don't get me wrong, there's still the odd busy day, often one day a week, but most of the time it's telling people to do things, giving advice, and talking shit on teams (and redditing and online shopping) to make it seem like my presence is bigger than it is.

I've also hoarded some knowledge so I'm not rendered completely superfluous

I also can't be 'overemployed' or take on extra work because my brain is cooked and it's one of those jobs that I need to be present at all times and prepared to put in work even if I'm not doing anything. That in itself is stressful.

I earn six figures and have been here over 5 years. There's an office but no anchor days and no real motivation or rule to go in.

Now here's the thing. It sounds like the dream, right? Wrong. I feel like I've got burnout but burnout from being... understimulated?

My brain feels like it's in such a fog that I can't see through it. It feels like a depression, even though I'm still active, and have hobbies, social life, healthy relationships etc, but I often feel tired, exhausted from pretending.

It's started spilling over into my personal life though where I can't brainstorm with my SO on what to have for dinner, weekend plans, home projects etc. I just shut down and can't compute things.

I'm also interviewing for new roles to get me out of the funk. Except it's daunting. Everyone's said 'Oh new jobs and interviews are nerve-wracking' but I feel like it's deeper than that.

I feel like it's the golden handcuffs in many ways, I've been on this good ticket not doing much for so long that my brain is fried and it's going to be the shock of a lifetime moving elsewhere where things are demanded of me, that I'm scared of underperforming or exhausting myself more.

Any advice?

tl;dr lying flat/quiet quitting leading to immense brain rot, advice sought on new roles, how to feel mentally stimulated

I couldn't smell 99 percent of scents and those which I could smell were not accurate scents. I was gifted the wildstone edge and that's the first scent i could smell after 3 years🥲 . I began the collection soon after and went after anything that I felt good to smell. I never bought perfumes for the compliment at the beginning but the Afnan 9pm rebel changed that. It gave me alot of compliments and my gf loves the smell so much. 


The mehs

- Bella Vita ceo ( not my kind of smell )

- em5 pause ( only because of the performance. It smells okay)

Personal favourite -
 
- Mocha wood by Fragrance world -- coffee with hazelnut.....   The best fragrance I had till now.

Date night- 

Afnan 9pm rebel and supremacy collectors edition ( fruity and spicy) 

Gym - wild stone edge and franz silver.

The underrated but my current go to

- Vanilla kiss by zudio( yeah I know it is feminine but I like it ) 

Solid perfume and attars are used for layering mostly 

Theorome and oud mood are kept in a dark store room for macerating as they smell synthetic now( hope they smell good afternoon 3 months)

*And then I can tell myself /
What the hell I'm supposed to do /
And then I can tell myself /
Not to ~~ride along~~ watch that mediocre movie with you*

37%, by the way. Look it up if you don’t believe me.

There’s an alternate path where, after we smoke a bowl, we check Rotten Tomatoes, and you make peace with returning that DVD unwatched. Then we choose something else from the stack compelling enough that we don’t turn toward each other, lock eyes, and hook up out of boredom.

(And yes, dear reader, a DVD. Trading DVDs in the mail using the not-yet-a-streaming-service Netflix. Does that make us pioneers of Netflix and chill? I struggle to remember another movie or show we ever watched together from start to finish from this turning point onward into the years that follow.)

But we didn’t check Rotten Tomatoes.
Instead, we explored each other while the menu music from the long-forgotten DVD looped on repeat for hours, until the sun rose and you drove us down the street to get coffee (such a gentleman). I still remember the nervous and worried look on your face that I could only interpret as regretful when you sat across the table from me and said, “Are you okay?” What a strange question. I don’t remember exactly what I said to change your expression to relief; it just seemed to me like you must have been freaking out that I would read too much into what just happened. “I’m fine. We’re good. It’s cool.”(Note: Gone Girl will not come out for another 5 years — too late for me to learn the Cool Girl Monologue.)

I had to quit caffeine so going full decaf. Right now working through some Roast House Ethiopia Suke Quto.  I am still dialing in my preferred recipe for deecaf--all my home brewing experience is with caffeinated beans. I haven't gotten an amazing cup from this Suke Quto yet- it's either tolerable but flat or too bitter. I can get an ok amount of tartness but can't get the tangerine / blueberry sweetness that this supposedly has. 

  
I've seem conflicting information- a lot of people seem to say that with decaf, courser grind and lower temp are the way- the extreme side of that seems to be Lance Hedricks recipe which is 1:4 and 80 degree water then bypass... kind of reminds me of Nel Drip.  The reasoning given is decaffeination removes a lot of solubles so you don't need to push it as hard to get what you want out of it. This recipe is supposed to really push the sweetness forward and I'm not getting that. 

On the other side I've seen recommendations to grind finer and go hotter to draw out the sweetness and that decaf prefers higher temps.  

I'm missing the sweetness and the tartness could be higher too.

I’m Nod (25, M). I have a coworker since 2020 who I am very close with. He’s 33, M. At first, i thought he was fil-chi too kasi he has white complexion with a very singkit eyes. Anyways, so we started as a casual coworker. He’s smart. The type na you could say he has been brought up with smart parents. He’s very mature. Soft spoken and has a smart mouth. We applied together as ojts for an IT company. After graduation, we applied on the same company and  got hired. Magaling sya sa work and he’s a teamplayer. I had happy crush on him. Yong tipong papasok ka and you wouldn’t really feel tired. Eastwood office namin. He’s living in east ortigas while i live in Mckinley. I was lowkey hitting on him. Sending signals if he does like it too. Yong tipong if mag bebreak, i’ll wait if he’ll invite me, and he always do. Haha ang cringe kasi there were moments na  i realized na sobrang pabebe ko na pala. Pero I haven’t heard anything from him. He’s just fine with it. I even invited him sa place ko with coworkers to hangout. He’s down too. Until we two got super close. There were times na, I when i arrived on my station, my coffee ako. Sinasabayan nya ako whenever he’ll drive thru wherever he would get coffee before hitting the office. Super lowkey ako kinikilig ako  grabe yong butterflies in the stomach, pa birds na. There were also times na, nauuna syang matapos sa work and i’ll find him at the lobby bc he’s waiting for me. So as a hopeless romantic, im always on cloud 9. There were even times na mag eat out kami. Tapos late ako dumating, he’ll always save a chair for me beside him. Tapos get ng water. Tapos yong food, sya nag lalagay sa plate ko, mga ganon. Hindi namin maiwasang itukso kami, pero i really wasnt sure and im very scared to even tell. Madaming beses i consider to clear it pero di ko kaya. 

Until, i figured out he has a girlfriend. Super heart attack. Nakakawala sa gana and stuff. I was secretly crying over my friends kasi i was telling myself na baka wrong ako. Na i really was just delulu. I felt like was a traitor. Kasi feeling ko he’s just looking at me like a baby brother pero sakin may ganon. So umiwas ako. Super hirap. Pero i did, kasi naawa ako sa sarili ko and to him. Na for him it was just really nothing. 

To end this, we’re still on the same company, we still get along naman with other co workers but not the same as before. I really tried my best na to cut  it kasi, mahirap super. May times lang na, makaka “like we used to” ka pero it has to end. I think i can feel too na naiwas sya.

I suspected something going on the beginning of October right before my birthday. My husband disappeared twice in a couple days and didn’t communicate with me at all and ignored me for hours. The first day he disappeared he spoofed his location and then texted me hours later to tell me he went to see his uncle. This was proven to be a lie because he met up with a woman and went to a coffee shop supposedly. The second time he disappeared I wasn’t worried because I believed that he was really going to help his uncle. Turns out he went to a hotel 30 minutes away and met up with this woman again and they had sex / did sexual things. They both have different stories, he said they just did sexual things but she said they had sex (unprotected) which he never even does with me. So I found this out Oct 29 and then I was upset and depressed since then. Well fast forward to 2 days ago I found out he was talking to her on Nov 8 and saying he is going to divorce me and leave me for her. Saying he needs a plan to leave because he has stuff he doesn’t want to lose in the apartment. How he cares so much about this girl and everything she’s going through, but doesn’t care what his own wife is going through after finding out he cheated? How could he care more about a woman he’s known for a month vs me who he has been with for 6 and a half years. We have a whole life together and dogs. He says he was lying to her about divorcing me and all that stuff, but he doesn’t want me to text her or her husband (they’re open I guess) to tell them that he isn’t divorcing me he says he will leave me / be away from me if I do text them. I think he honestly was telling her the truth about wanting to leave me. He wants me to go to my sisters house in a different state so he can focus on streaming and be successful. I think he wants me gone so he can “prove” to her that he is not with me anymore. The last text she sent him was “don’t contact me unless you have full proof that you aren’t with her anymore”. Like how gross is that on her part as well? Am I in the wrong for wanting to text and tell them he isn’t divorcing me? I feel like if I send the text he will just be away from me and talking / on the phone with her. Why would he be so defensive about me texting? ",1,1763533690.0,BPD,1,1.0,False
1p106sj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialistStrategy/comments/1p106sj/what_is_to_be_done_positions_for_the/,What is to be done? Positions for the revolutionary party of the United States.,"The United States is not ""backward"" in the sense of Tsarist Russia (feudal peasants) or 1949 China (agrarian collapse). 

It is hyper-developed yet physically hollowed out.

We have the highest technology (Silicon Valley, AI, aerospace) sitting atop a rotting, de-industrialized base where the majority of the population serves coffee, files insurance claims, or drives Ubers.

**1. The Prime Task: ""Strategic Re-Materialization""**

We do not need to rebuild the textile mills of the 19th century; let the global south keep the low-value production if they wish, or automate it.

The prime task is Re-Materialization of the Critical Chain.

The US economy currently relies on imperialist rent, it prints dollars to buy things made elsewhere. 

A revolutionary state may be embargoed by capitalist powers immediately, namely Europe. 

Therefore, we must regain the physical capacity to build:

 - Energy Infrastructure: (Nuclear/Green transition)

 - High-Tech Foundry: (Semiconductors/Chips)

 - Machine Tools: (The machines that make machines)

We do not need to make cheap plastic toys. We need to make the means of production itself.

**2. The Robot Question: The New ""Electrification""**

 We must mass produce humanoid robots. 

Lenin famously said: ""Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country.""

In our context, the slogan becomes:

 ""Communism is Proletarian Democracy plus the Mass Production of Automation.""


Why?


 - The Labor Shortage: The US population is aging.


 - The ""Bullshit Job"" Problem: Millions of Americans work in insurance, marketing, corporate law, and financial speculation. These industries produce zero value and will be abolished immediately.


 - The Solution: We do not want to send the insurance adjuster to the metaphorical coal mine. We want to send the insurance adjuster to art school or nursing, while the Robot goes to the mine.

The mass production of humanoid robots is the only way to maintain high living standards while abolishing the exploitation of the Global South.

**3. The Party Message: ""The End of Wage Slavery""**

If we promise ""hard labor for the glory of the state,"" the American worker will laugh. They are used to consumption, not sacrifice.

The Message: ""Capitalism invents the Robot to starve you. We invent the Robot to free you.""


The platform is simple:

 - The 20-Hour Work Week: Immediately possible by eliminating ""bullshit jobs"" and redirecting labor to essential sectors.

 - Universal Access to the Surplus: The robots belong to the public. The dividends of their labor pay for your housing and food.

 - We do not glorify ""work"" for work's sake. We glorify the abolition of drudgery.


**4. The State: The ""Logistics State"" (Cybernetic Centralism)**

What does the state look like? It looks like Amazon or Walmart, but democratized.

The US already has the most advanced central planning infrastructure in history, it is just currently owned by private corporations.

Walmart's Supply Chain is a marvel of planned economics. It tracks every tube of toothpaste in real-time.

The Revolutionary State simply seizes this data infrastructure.

 - Cybersyn 2.0: We use the existing data centers to match production to need in real-time. The ""State"" is a dashboard of resources, accessible to the public, where we vote on allocation priorities (e.g., ""This year, 10% more steel to high-speed rail, 5% less to office construction"").


**5. The Social Relations: From ""Service"" to ""Care""**

In a service economy, the ""proletariat"" is often the nurse, the teacher, the barista, the coder.

**Under Capitalism:** The barista serves the customer (servitude).


**Under Socialism:** The service worker becomes the Care Worker or the Cultural Worker.
We elevate the status of ""reproductive labor"" (teaching, nursing, elderly care) to the highest tier of social respect. 

Since robots handle the production of things, humans focus on the production of people (education, health, art, exploration).


***Summary of the Vanguard's ""First 100 Days"" Decree:***

 - Nationalization of the ""Big Five"": (Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta). Their servers are now the brain of the Planned Economy.

 - The ""Re-Shoring"" Act: Immediate construction of automated factories for pharmaceuticals, chips, and robotics.

 - The Debt Jubilee: All consumer debt is erased. The financial sector is dissolved.

 - The ""Freedom from Drudgery"" Mandate: Massive investment in the production of humanoid robots. The goal is explicitly stated: To eliminate human manual labor within 20 years.

*The contradiction to watch:*

*The ""Professional Managerial Class"" (the middle managers, the academics, the technocrats). They will be the hardest to integrate. They are not capitalists, but they despise being ""workers.""*

What happened?,"I [19M] met this girl [20F] at a mutual friend’s birthday party. We hit it off so well, realized we had a lot in common - went home together and smoked (didn’t get physical or anything, she said she was looking for something more). Later that week we went out together and got coffee and had upwards of 5 dates alone together in the span of a month, in addition to just hanging out with common friends, going to the bars together, and liming around.

After the third date I ask her about her past relationships. Might’ve been a bit soon but she didn’t mind. She said she’s only had one boyfriend before, and that they broke up 6 months ago. For context, I’ve never been in a relationship before. Anyway, a couple weeks later, we sit down to talk and she tells me that her ex has been texting her and wants to know from me if I’m serious about her and that I’m not casually talking to her. I tell her yes, and that I wouldn’t be hanging out with her if I wasn’t serious. She also brings up that he’s been stalking her and stalking us together (we all go to the same college), and that he found out we were dating and she said he probably couldn’t fathom her being with another guy because he was under the impression they would get back together and get married at some point. I very bluntly asked her at this point if she still had feelings for him - to which she said no. She also tells me that they “officially” broke up around a month and a half ago and not 6 as I previously thought and that she had blocked him initially and then unblocked him because “it wasn’t that deep”

Now I’m not really a jealous person, and so I didn’t tell her/pressure her to block him or stop talking to him. I thought it made the most sense that if she wanted to stop talking to him it should come from her and not me. I don’t know the extent of their conversations, but what disappointed me was the fact that she was entertaining it - especially considering that she said he cheated on her.

After this conversation, we hung out for another couple weeks and got even closer. We never did anything physical - I tried near the beginning but she was hesitant so I decided I would let her make the first move when she felt comfortable as she’d told me about her trust issues etc. 

One night we were hanging out, and she said something to which I thought was a good time to tell her that I liked her (might’ve been a mistake). Reason I did it was to make my intentions clear to her and to sort of get her to open up if she was confused about our situation. Just thought that open communication would help move things forward. Everything went on smoothly for a few days after that, and she left campus to go home for a weekend and came back and I noticed a little shift in her texting tone. A few days later she asked to talk which I kind of saw coming. She asked to be friends because she wasn’t ready for a relationship. She said I was “someone she liked but couldn’t pursue because it felt wrong”. What does that mean? I also wanted to understand why she would want to be friends with me. Wouldn’t that make things awkward if she got back with her ex? Is that something that could even happen? After he cheated on her? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

I’m just confused because we were extremely compatible and she recognized that. Our families have similar values, we share the same beliefs, we have the same idea of a relationship and we got along great. 

I ended up telling her that I was sorry and I couldn’t be friends with her because that would just mean we’d be in limbo and it would hurt us more than anything. I told her that if she ever felt ready for a relationship, that she could reach out to me and I’d be happy to try again. I’d love to be her friend cause I really enjoyed being with her, but that would just be torture. 

I also removed her from social media just to not get my hopes up in terms of anything happening. Is it possible though that she could come back to me? Does it make sense for her to go back to her ex? Who mind you, cheated on her and was actively stalking us? At one point she told me she was “delusional” for being with him, also partly because he isn’t the same religion as her, and her dad wouldn’t approve of that - although she did say he said he would convert for her. She still has him on social media so could she just still have feelings for him / feel bad? 

I’ve never been in a relationship before and was wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation before or has insight on what’s going on…

So basically I think it goes without saying but this isn't gonna be a fight in the traditional sense, this is most likely gonna be a battle of the brains.

With that being said I think how the episode could start is that we see Light eating dinner with his family and at some point Light's Dad mentions that the Japanese police department called in Columbo to help them with the Kira case, it'll then cut to the next day where Light and Ryuk discuss how Light could possibly defeat Columbo and even mentions that he's never heard of him.

By coincidence Light sees Columbo walking out of the police station and catches him before he leaves after some introductions Light invites him to a cafe for some coffee and Columbo agrees because while reading the Kira file he found that Light was a suspect. In a reflection of the cafe scene with Light and L both of them are talking while Light is trying to get him to say his name in which we get the bit where he says his first name is Lieutenant, which will frustrate Light.

The whole ""fight"" is basically Light and Columbo talking with Light having his inner monologues and Ryuk just teasing Light the whole time. The ""fight"" would end by Columbo dropping his wallet and Light reading his driver's license as he hands it back to him.
Light then shakes his hand and using slightly of hand he writes his name in the Death Note page he keeps in his watch before saying: ""I'm Kira.""

If Light wins Columbo walks away and it'll skip to him getting to a hotel room where he'll have a heart attack.

If Columbo wins, nothing happens and 2 cops arrest Light since he just confessed and the reason the Death Note didn't work was because the drivers license that Columbo had in his wallet was fake. Later in prison Ryuk writes Lights name in his Death Note and we get a recreation of the ending scene from the anime.",3,1763533556.0,deathbattle,0,1.0,False

How can put them at ease?","[Edit] *Have changed a few of the work/location details as my post history would make it obvious to anyone in my small locality where and who I'm talking about, but the circumstances remain the same*

I work in a mall and share facilities and a cafe with staff from other shops in the mall. One of the young guys from down the hall and I would make small talk while waiting in line for coffee. 

I'd notice each time we met that he'd sometimes initiate a conversation and then suddenly freak out and walk off as I was in the middle of answering a question he put to me about a mutual connection. He'd ask if I'd seen the person around lately, I'd explain we hadn't talked because we had a falling out, and then this guy (we'll call him James), would throw his arms up and say ""please don't involve me I want nothing to do with it"". 

I made a mental note of it, so wouldn't bring it up again. However, on a number of different occasions, James would broach the subject again. ""Have you seen - - - - - lately?"" ""Good to see you and - - - - - are all good with each other again."" 

Each time I was a few words in to answering the questions he was putting to me, about a subject he kept raising, he would freak out and ask me not to involve him. It got to the point I thought he was trying to mess with me after a while. 

Then he became frosty with me. He would roll his eyes when I walked in to the cafeteria and ignore me when I said hi or nodded toward him. After about a week of awkwardness, I asked the barista, who we both spoke to sometimes, if she knew what his issue was. She told me that James had complained that I was ""bringing him into drama"" and he felt harassed around me. I explained that I only ever responded when prompted after his first freak out about the subject, and how I thought James was deliberately trying to set traps for me or something. James was the one raising the very subject he would then get upset at talking about. 

The batista said James had aspergers and reads situations differently than NT people. 

I also found out another incident had happened where a friend who was with me on one occasion had apparently made a derogatory comment to James about the way he dressed (James wears makeup and paints his nails, and my friend is a bit of a dinosaur with gender stuff). I found James and apologised for the incident. He accepted my apology and things were fine again for about a week. Then out of nowhere he started giving me the cold shoulder again, but this time things escalated to a point where he started giving me really nasty scowling looks, and then pushed past me roughly when I was in queue, almost spilling his coffee on me. 

I asked ChatGPT what was going on, and it said people with Aspergers like James would have a pattern recognition way of analysis that has now flagged me as an unsafe, chaotic individual, first for making him uncomfortable, in conversation, for someone associated with me being rude to him, and finally, because he knew I had spoken to the barista about our tension without his consent.

GPT also informed me that changing his view of me and making him feel safe, or at least neutral around me now is pretty much impossible because of the Aspergers. I have effectively permanently been filed away in his brain as an unsafe quality. 

What can I do? We see each other daily and the weird looks and tension keep being an issue ",1,1763533348.0,aspergers,1,1.0,False

0 human reach out. nobody cares, At work I am like a automaton a coffee machine or something that does a purpose nothing more. I hardly have real human interaction there. I remember I was sick for 4 days and I didn't go to work in those 4 days, When I went back on the 5th day nobody noticed I was gone HR didn't even Ask for a sick note. I went there and they just said its fine.

The NHL’s most thrilling mismatch of offensive fireworks and defensive fragility arrives Wednesday as the **Carolina Hurricanes** (-151) roll into St. Paul to face the **Minnesota Wild** (+127). Let’s break this down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a penguin on a trampoline.

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Goalies

Carolina’s case for victory is as sturdy as a brick wall… if that wall were built entirely of pucks. The Hurricanes are second in the league in goals scored (69 total, 3.6 per game) and boast a +15 goal differential. Their star, Sebastian Aho (18 points), is the team’s culinary equivalent of a five-star chef—consistent, reliable, and never serving a dish named “loss.” Defensively? Well, they’re not exactly the Great Wall of China, allowing 2.5 goals per game. But when your offense can outscore most teams’ entire seasons, who needs a functional defense?

Minnesota, meanwhile, is the NHL’s version of a leaky sieve. They’re 22nd in goals scored (2.8 per game) and 22nd in goals allowed (3.0 per game), with a -6 differential that’s about as appealing as a root canal. Their recent injury crisis has forced rookie **Danila Yurov**, 21, into a top-line center role. Yurov’s NHL resume? One assist in his previous game. His new job: sandwiched between Kirill Kaprizov and Mats Zuccarello like a rookie intern thrust into a corner office. Spoiler: He’s probably still figuring out where the coffee machine is.

**Implied probabilities**? Carolina’s -151 line suggests bookmakers give them a 60% chance to win. Minnesota’s +127 line implies 43.5%—which is generous if you’ve seen their defense. The Over/Under of 6 goals? A nod to Carolina’s offensive artillery and Minnesota’s porous net.
