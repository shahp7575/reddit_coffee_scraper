1q0z9az,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moradabad/comments/1q0z9az/worst_case_a_good_chat_best_case_we_vibe/,Worst case: a good chat. Best case: we vibe.,"Engineering student from a Tier-1 college here—basically someone who can overthink problems *and* pick a decent café. Above-average looks (according to my friends… and my mirror on good days).

Looking to meet a girl who’s ambitious, career-focused, and has solid values in life. Platonic dates are totally welcome too—sometimes good conversations and chai/coffee are elite enough.

If you enjoy chill talks, laughs over random stuff, and making simple moments fun, slide into my DMs. Worst case: we have a nice chat. Best case: we vibe 😄

1q0z1ec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1q0z1ec/pa_rate_our_time_clock_policy/,[PA] Rate our time clock policy.,"Workplace is a manufacturing shop. 20 to 25 employees and basic shift is 6am - 2:30pm. This question is coming from the person who set up this policy about 3 years ago. Timeclocks are tablets using the HomeBase app.

Each employee is told that they need to start and end their workday based upon the nearest 15 minute interval. If they intend to have a 6:00am start time they can clock in at 6:00 but they are also welcome to clock in anywhere between 5:46 and 6:00am. This allows for the common scenario where someone comes in, gets their coffee, puts their lunch away, and clocks in in no particular order. Supervisors communicate clearly that work start time is at the 15 min. interval and employees are not to work until thier interval after clock in starts.

Carrying this through, if someone is late and the time clock says 6:01, then their work time is then 6:15. They can do whatever they want for 14 minutes except work and are expected to start working at 6:15.

Similarly at the end of the day, everyone is to stop working at a 15 minute interval. A clock out time of anywhere between 2:30 and 2:44pm is treated as a work stop time of 2:30. If they worked up until 2:35 they are instructed to continue working until 2:45pm and then clock out. 

This policy seems to work great. But setting it up on the computer was difficult initially. I could not find a time clock that would automatically perform the time rounding. Time rounding seems to be a dirty word but it wouldnt need to be if the app simply stated ""you are clocked in for a 6:00am start time"". Instead we have to tell everyone that a 5:48 clock in means a 6:00am start time. What I did to make this work is made an excel sheet where the home base export is copied into the first tab. The second tab does the conversions. The third tab produces the time sheets - that are printed biweekly and handed to each employee a few days before payday.

As a side note. Employees have an unpaid lunch 12-12:30 each day. The excel sheet looks to see if they were clocked in over that period and subtracts 1/2 hour accordingly. Employees only need to spend their time clocking out/in if they are leaving the property. If they work through lunch for any reason a simple change in the spreadsheet for the default answer of ""yes"" lunch break taken to ""no"" makes it correct. I would also love this function to be built in to a time clock. 

TLDR: employees are to start and stop at 15 min. intervals and time clock is rounded.

I stayed at places like Củi Homestay and Tini Home Da Lat, and also visited friends staying at HYGGE Homestay and Nhà Sói Homestay. All of them felt cozy, relaxed, and perfect for slow mornings with coffee. These places also have plenty of real photos online, so it’s easy to see what you’re getting.

Definitely every place is set up so people can spend their money. 

If you go without too much planning on what activities to do and be spontaneous, you ll have a good time. 

My visit was rescheduled from 24th to 31st due to rain, lol but it was still raining today as well. 

Anyway, my experience was pretty good!!

It was surreal and felt like a dream walking in starshollow. 

It was pretty and charming as it was on the show. 

Yes as everyone mentioned before, there were lines. But I went without planning to do specific activities and was spontaneous to whatever happens. I was just happy to be there. 

**Details**:

My slot was 12. Joined the entry line around 11:40. After the regular tour we got dropped off at FRIENDS cafe and then could proceed to Starshollow. 

First you see line for lorelai’s home. So see for QR codes close to that area and book your time ahead. At 1:30 we booked for a 4:30 time. We went in 10 min when we got our time slot. 

Just roamed around the entire town several times. Took pictures, mind you every store, every pop up you visit, there’s always something to buy. Basically you can spend a lot of stuff. I felt it wasn’t worth buying much. 

I wanted ti buy specifically from starshollow books. I thought there would be some of Rory’s fav books but no they only had some GG brand ones. But pretty cool ones. Sookie’s recipes, Gilmore girls cook book, other stationery. 

See photos 5, 6. I thought it was a great idea to write my thoughts for episodes I watch and may be pass it on to my kids or loved ones later in life (lol I just celebrated a bday so feeling emotional 🥹) 

Food was okay. Ate an apple tart at Weston’s, was delicious. Husband bought a candy cane coffee, he loved it. 

Had egg roll from Al’s pancake. Was not bad. 

Tried jalapeño chipotle sauce Mac and cheese from Hues bros shop which was good. 

It was raising today, but still I was very happy to experience it. 

Went to a trivia game unexpectedly. It was fun! Again did not plan to do anything and just went with the flow. 

The town looked so gorgeous with the lights after sunset. 

I felt I had a great end to 2025.

Every time I asked about meeting his family, my CEO husband shut me down with that line. And I actually bought it.





Until today—





I closed the billion-dollar deal that made his company and finally showed up at his family's door.





Who answered?





A nine-year-old kid. Looked me up and down like I was trash.





""Ew. Who are you? Why are you looking for MY dad?""





Before I could speak, a maid dragged me inside.





Right there in the middle of the living room—a wedding photo. My husband and his assistant.





The maid grabbed my arm, all excited. ""Can you believe it? They've been married TEN YEARS! And their little boy—he's gotten so big!""





""Oh, and she just landed this MASSIVE contract—like, billions! Sir's over the moon. Whole party planned for tonight!""





I watched the kid throw himself into my husband's arms. Watched that assistant lean into them like they were one happy family.





My brain flatlined.





So ""not ready yet""? A lie.





So our ten-year marriage? Fake.





So every success I bled for? Just a gift to her.





But here's what he doesn't know—





I didn't need him.





He needed me.





And that empire he thinks he built? I'm about to take it back!





\---





Around the corner, my husband Garrett Vaughn had his hand wrapped around his assistant Sienna's waist. Gave it a squeeze that made me want to puke.





He laughed, voice all low. ""Stop babying him. Kid's nine and still climbing all over his dad. Come on.""





Then leaned right into her ear—didn't even try to hide it. ""Those arms? Mine. Tonight.""





Sienna's face went red. Pushed him but she was smiling. ""God, ten years and you still want more?""





His eyes went dark. Thumb rubbing circles on her hip. ""Look at you right now... how could I not?""





My nails dug into my palms so hard I should've bled. But didn't feel a thing.





They were all over each other like I wasn't even there.





The joke? I basically wasn't.





Ten years married and I'd never been allowed in this house. Meanwhile they'd been playing house here the whole time. Kid and all.





Garrett wasn't done. Started whispering about getting the kid to bed so they could ""take care of business.""





That's when he saw me standing there. Face went white as a sheet.





Froze up. Lips shaking. ""Reagan... w-what're you doing here?""





Everything went dead quiet.





Sienna looked at me, confused. ""Who's this?""





He practically threw her off him. Cleared his throat. ""Honey, this is Reagan Ashford. Sales department—always traveling, so you probably haven't met.""





I laughed. Couldn't help it. Ten years. Built this company with him from nothing. Now I'm just ""sales.""





Sienna didn't even respond to him. Just looked me over, eyes landing on my bracelet.





The look on her face? Pure disgust.





""How's some low-level sales girl wearing something like that? Doesn't it look exactly like the one I threw out last time?""





The humiliation hit me like a truck.





Garrett jumped in fast. ""Babe, you know how it is—some people can't afford the real thing so they dig through trash. You tossed that bracelet at the office, she probably fished it out.""





Just like that. Made himself look innocent. Made me look pathetic.





He kept shooting me these desperate looks. Begging me to shut up.





But that bracelet? He'd given it to me himself.





After I closed a major deal, he came to my office, put it on my wrist with his own hands. Said it was part of a matching set and he had the other one. Told me never to take it off.





I'd promised myself right then—land the billion-dollar contract, make his parents accept me, make our marriage something real.





Missed one tiny detail though. He never wore the ""matching"" piece.





Took me this long to realize—the gift I'd been holding onto like it meant everything? Just garbage someone else threw out.





And the real reason he wouldn't let me meet his family? He was already married to someone else.





I took a breath. Forced down everything burning in my chest. Gave them my coldest smile.





""My bad. Didn't know it wasn't mine."" I ripped the bracelet off and threw it on the floor. ""Here. Take it back.""





The sound of it shattering echoed through the whole room.





Garrett lunged at me. Slapped me across the face so hard my ears rang.





""You just broke my wife's stuff! Reagan, you're WAY out of line!""





Five red marks burning across my cheek.





I touched my face, looking at this man I'd given everything to. Realized I didn't even know him.





""Yeah. My mistake.""





With that, I turned to leave.





""Wait.""





Chapter 2





Sienna's voice stopped me. All fake-sweet. ""Don't rush off. Since you're here anyway, might as well stay, right?""





""So tonight? My father-in-law's celebrating ME—that billion-dollar deal I just closed. You're with the company, aren't you? Stick around. Party's gonna be fun.""





Made sure to really emphasize ""billion-dollar deal."" Eyes daring me to say something.





Garrett's face twitched. Looked like he wanted to speak. But Sienna's glare shut him up.





She glanced around with this smug look. ""My husband had this whole place redone for me. Everything's exactly how I like it. Pick any room you want—make yourself at home.""





""NO!""





The kid suddenly screamed. Grabbed onto Sienna's leg. ""Mom! I don't want this homeless lady in our house! She's gross! She'll make everything stink!""





""Look how dark she is! Her clothes are all nasty! She probably crawled out of a dumpster! Make her leave!""





Sienna's smile got even wider.





I looked at her—all pampered and perfect.





Then down at my own hands—rough and beat up from years of hustling. Skin dark from being outside constantly.





For Garrett and those deals, I'd worked myself half to death. Drank until I had a bleeding ulcer. Never complained once.





But ten years of that?





A complete joke.





I pulled out my phone, laughing bitterly—return tickets sold out. Stuck here whether I liked it or not.





Second I dropped my bag in the guest room, Garrett called.





""I TOLD you not to come here. But you just had to show up anyway, huh? Trying to embarrass me on purpose?""





""Reagan, listen to me—this little stunt you pulled? It's disgusting. I'm pissed. Really pissed. And don't expect me to forgive you anytime soon!""





Listened to him rant. My fingers curling into fists.





Ten years. Every fight went exactly like this.





He'd screw up. Somehow flip it around. Wait for me to come crawling back begging.





And I always did. Like some pathetic dog throwing away my dignity just to make him happy.





This time I finally worked up the nerve. Wanted to ask him—""How can you be legally married to two people?""





But before I could get the words out, line went dead.





I tried calling back. Blocked.





Guess I didn't even deserve to ask questions.





My chest felt hollow. Like someone had scooped out my heart. Couldn't even feel the pain anymore.





Standing by the window staring at nothing when the door slammed open.





Sienna stormed in. That sick smile on her face.





SMACK!





Stack of photos hit me in the face. Sharp edges cutting my cheek.





""So YOU'RE the side piece? Thought I didn't know about you?""





I clenched my fists, voice coming out rough. ""I'm his legal wife! We have a marriage certificate!""





""Marriage certificate?"" Sienna burst out laughing.





Pulled out some documents. ""Your marriage certificate's fake, sweetie. Whole thing's been one big con!""





""Only reason he kept you around this long? You're useful. Like a loyal little dog who does whatever he says.""





I grabbed the papers with shaking hands. Vision going dark.





Right there in black and white—my marriage certificate was fake.





Sienna smoothed out her skirt. Tone all casual.





""Garrett told me himself. Said you were pathetic enough to work for scraps—barely asked for a salary, and you'd even spend YOUR money buying HIM gifts.""





""Oh, and all those proposals you stayed up all night working on? Every deal you drank yourself sick closing? All under MY name now.""





With that, she shoved a stack of photos in my face.





""Wow. Didn't realize you were such a freak. Garrett showed me all of this—he was actually proud of it. Guess when you can't satisfy a man the regular way, you gotta try this kinky shit instead. Embarrassing.""





Photos showed me wearing cat ears. On my knees. Worse things I couldn't look at.





Garrett had told me this was just ""couple's fun.""





So I'd humiliated myself trying to make him happy.





Yet he'd turned it all into entertainment.





Sienna kicked me in the chest. Sneered down at me.





""Oh, and these photos? Garrett posted them on the company forum ages ago. Wanna know what everyone's saying?""





""That you're some ugly toad trying to play sexy kitten."" She smirked. ""It's hilarious.""





I hit the floor. Pain in my chest nothing compared to the rage burning through me.





I'd known Garrett first. That assistant came later.





Somehow I'd become the mistress getting humiliated.





Couldn't stay here another second.





""I'm done. You'll never see me again.""





I dragged my suitcase toward the door.





But Garrett grabbed my wrist at the hallway corner.





Chapter 3





""Where do you think you're going this late?"" His face all annoyed. ""Can't just come and go whenever you feel like it. What do you think this place is?""





Looking at him acting all righteous, I almost laughed at how insane this was.





Just closed the biggest deal of my career. Rushed straight here desperate for his family's approval.





Found out about his happy little family instead.





""Mr. Vaughn,"" I said coldly, yanking my wrist free. ""Bit late to pretend you care, don't you think?""





His eyebrows drew together. ""Reagan, what's with the attitude? Who gave you permission to talk to me like that?""





About to leave when rapid footsteps echoed down the hall.





Garrett's son came running with a baseball bat. Swung it hard into my shin.





""AH!""





Pain made my legs buckle.





What shocked me more—watching that little brat throw himself backward, land on his ass, start wailing. ""The homeless lady hit me! She hit me!""





I stared at him in disbelief. Before I could react, Sienna came running. Scooped up the kid. Screamed at me.





""You homewrecking witch! Coming here causing trouble wasn't enough? Now you're hitting my son?""





""Look at yourself! If anything happens to my boy, I'll destroy you!""





Staff immediately surrounded us. Pointing. Whispering.





""Being a mistress is bad enough—hitting a kid? Shameless!""





""If I were the lady of the house, I'd strip her naked and throw her in the dumpster where she belongs!""





""Right? Some trashy nobody trying to start drama here. Without our lady, this company would be nothing!""





I grabbed the wall and pulled myself up, leg screaming.





Worse than that? Garrett's reaction.





Didn't even glance at me. Just crouched down checking on his son.





Once he confirmed the kid was fine, Garrett suddenly grabbed a fistful of my hair. Voice vicious in a way I'd never heard.





""Apologize to my son!""





Scalp felt like it was tearing. I kept my jaw clenched. ""I didn't touch him. Why should I apologize?""





""Garrett,"" I said, eyes burning. ""We've known each other fifteen years. Together for ten. Even if you wanted to marry your assistant and have a kid—why couldn't you just TELL me? You think I'd have made some pathetic scene?""





""I might not have much self-respect left, but I wouldn't have stood in your way. So why humiliate me like this? Why give me a fake marriage certificate? Turn me into a joke for the entire company?""





Something flickered in Garrett's eyes. But gone in a second. Replaced by cold nothing.





He let go of my hair. Looked down at me. ""Reagan, I thought you were smarter than this. Guess I was wrong.""





Garrett had the staff pin my shoulders down, forcing me to my knees.





""This is what you get for showing up uninvited. Deal with it.""





He turned to Sienna. ""Babe, go ahead. Hit her till you feel better. Till our son's happy.""





Kid's face lit up. Grabbed a crystal ashtray off the coffee table and hurled it at me.





Sharp edge sliced my forehead open. Blood immediately running down my face.





That's when Sienna suddenly put on this worried act. Completely different from how vicious she'd been earlier.





""Babe, maybe we should stop.""





Garrett laughed coldly. Grabbed Sienna's wrist. ""What're you scared of? I told you to hit her, so hit her!""





He wrapped his hand around hers. Started slapping me with it.





Sienna pretended to resist at first. Then started putting her own force behind it. Left bloody scratches across my face.





By the time they got bored, I was collapsed on the floor. Vision going black.





Sienna stood over me with that smug smile. Timing perfect as always.





""Babe, we should lock her in the basement for now. The Ashford heiress is coming soon—richest family in Manhattan. Can't have her seeing this mess.""





Garrett looked at me covered in blood and sneered.





""I told you this morning to think about what you did. Wouldn't listen. Brought this on yourself, Reagan. Go cool off in the basement!""





""When you learn how to behave, then you can come out!""





In the damp dark basement, staff shoved me hard.





I hit the ground. Blood still seeping from my forehead. Warm liquid sliding down my face.





""Disgusting homewrecker!""





Older maid spat right in my face.





""Look at yourself! Coming here acting like you own the place!""





Younger maid added her own spit.





Then the iron door slammed shut. Darkness swallowed me whole.





I curled up against the wall. Drowning in despair.





Ten years. This was what I got.





My hands were shaking so bad I could barely get my phone out. The dim screen lit up my pathetic face.





That number I hadn't called in forever—right now it was my only shot.





""Hello? Reagan?""





My sister's voice came through, warm but surprised.





My throat closed up. Tried to speak. Nothing came out but this choked sound.





""Sis,"" I managed to say, and suddenly I was crying. ""I messed up so bad.""





""Where are you?"" Her voice went sharp with worry. ""Did that piece of trash Garrett do something to you?""





""I want to come back to Ashford Industries..."" My eyes squeezed shut. Tears running down my face.





Silence on the other end. Then I heard her crying too.





""Dad was going to leave you everything. But you just HAD to throw it all away for that country nobody and his startup!""





Her voice caught. ""Something's wrong. You're hurt, aren't you?""





""Sis,"" I said, feeling like a lost kid who'd finally found home. ""Please come get me.""





""Hang on!"" Her voice turned sharp, commanding. ""I'm on my way right now!""





I hung up. Leaned against the freezing wall. Listened to party sounds echoing from upstairs.





Through the door crack, I could see the Vaughn house all lit up. People drinking. Laughing.





""Ms. Crane's so young and talented!""





""That billion-dollar deal just shot Vaughn Industries straight to the top!""





""Heard the Ashford heiress is coming too? Ms. Crane's really something!""





Garrett surrounded by people. Face all smug and satisfied.





Sienna on his arm. Makeup perfect. Smile sweet.





Suddenly, the main doors burst open.





Team of bodyguards in black flooded in. Woman leading them wore a sharp tailored suit. Presence like a knife.





Garrett and Sienna immediately plastered on these fake smiles. Rushed over.





""Ms. Ashford! So glad you could—""





She cut them off. Sharp eyes scanning everyone.





""My sister Reagan. Heir to Ashford Industries. Where is she?""

1q0ysl4,https://i.redd.it/2669g3rlxoag1.jpeg,My 2025 Year of Coffee,"With the new year comes a bit of reflection on the past. I've really enjoyed everyone sharing photos of what they've consumed over the past year and felt compelled to share mine for 2025.

Aside from the Luminous EoY Box Set, Color, Ruby, and Perc coffees at the very top of the image (though I have opened and enjoyed part of them), the rest have been fully-consumed throughout the year. They are, for the most part, oldest to newest from top to bottom.

It's been a wild ride over the last 12 months. I started off with some fun options from Dak, which opened my eyes a bit to what specialty coffee can really be. Milky Cake was really interesting, though I'm not sure I share the enthusiasm for it beyond a few cups into the bag. But I was still playing things fairly safe at the start of the year, opting mostly for medium-ish roasts that yielded caramels, chocolates, nuts, and maybe a bit of citrus or subtle stone fruit.

Then things took a fun turn when I took the plunge on the Decaf Project, which expanded my horizons in the world of decaf coffee. No longer would I ignore the decaf! Hence the Decaf Elixir bags in the center, which yielded some fruity and delightful cups of afternoon coffee. I learned not all decafs are created equal and found my preferences for Swiss or mountain water processed coffees for fruit notes and EA/Sugarcane for delicious caramels, nuts, and chocolates.

On a trip to the Orlando area, I dropped into Haan, Stemma, and Orlando Coffee Roasters. They are ALL totally worth a visit, in my opinion. My absolute favorite coffee this year was from Haan. The watermelon co-ferment was so fun, and it started my exploration of co-fermented and more experimental coffees.

When I got back, I was ambushed by my friends giving me 8 bags of coffee from Atomic and Harbinger, steering me back into the medium roast lane for a long time. But I found myself longing to get back to fruity cups, and so I delved into Color and (particularly) Anodyne near the end of the year. The coffee from Anodyne had such wonderful notes of hibiscus! Probably my second favorite bag of 2025.

So, overall, my journey went all over the place. I'm excited to see where 2026 takes me from here. Happy New Year, everyone!",0,1767253468.0,pourover,0,0.5,False

I am a solo traveler from Germany and right now near Sulthan Bathery planning my next destination to travel to for tomorrow. I already spent around 10 days in Kerala and want to change state. I have to be in Mumbai on January 8th for my flight early morning on 9th of January, so realistically one more place to visit. I really enjoyed my scooty day trips around Kalpetta through scenic coffee and tea plantations and wildlife areas also seeing village and small city life happy to share about this.

Really I am open to anything but big city metropolitan and touristy overrun areas. For me possibility for scooter rental is important. There are three options I am eyeballing:

1. Take a bus (day or overnight doesn’t matter) to another hill side area, get a stay in the nature (forest or farm stay) and explore the area with scooty, looking for nice scenery, wildlife and not single highlight overrun tourist attractions.
2. Take a bus to some beach destination + scooty exploring.
3. Completely change location - go to Bangalore with bus and take a flight to a whole different area. Was thinking Assam area or Amritsar Golden Temple and then out of the city for farm stay.

What are your thoughts on my options? What would you opt for next? Do you have any hidden gem recommendations regarding my options?

I was already prone to loneliness due to cptsd, isolation, and living somewhere remote where almost nobody below 80 lived. I lost the only thing I had that kept me well during lockdown....a social life. 

To compensate for the torture that was living and being trapped in an abusive household back then for 2 years I stared binge eating to cope. I gained a lot of weight in a short time because I'm small. Needless to say my social life died afterwards. I spent pretty much all my days being at home, su*idal, calling s-icide Hotlines, going to a toxic therapist, drawing and eating chips....Being overweight was one thing the abuse stressed me so badly I had rashes on my face, eczema, I looked like 50 year old woman, people on the streets thought I was mimimum hitting 30. All I did was suffer and cry every day and try to stop those feelings of wanting to die with food and later also alcohol. 

I didn't have a life. I didn't develop good friendships, I didn't have anyone to travel with nor the ressources, I didn't have a romantic relationship, I never got to wear what I want, I wasn't treated like a young person rather like a grown woman because of my apperance back then......

I feel the effects in conversation, people show and tell me about vacations, family, partner, partys, social life, Gifts.....I have nothing to tell other than talk abt my job or my solo coffee trips.... it's extremely devastating I wished so badly I had a normal life

To start, I get that there is a 1% of players that are whales that this game makes money off of. However, just doing some shower math, i feel like this game could be way more profitable with a lower price point. For example, the average player isn’t going to drop $15 on an event boost. Sure, you’ll get your 1%, but if we assume (for context of this example) 1000 players, that’s $150 profit. If you dropped it down to $1.99, and then even only 25% of people would hop on it (which I would find conservative) that’s $250. 

If you go with premium passes, if you drop that down to $5, that would profit way more money than $30 per purchase based on the number of people that would be willing to pay that. 

I could go on, but I won’t. In my opinion, the gem/stone packs are actually fairly priced. I haven’t bought any, but I’m just playing this game for fun. I just feel like the incentive purchases are priced 5x-10x higher than they should be. I might have spent $100 on this game, but I’ve only spent $15 because of the price point. 

I get that there’s people that will spend loads on this game because they can, and honestly good for them. I’m happy for them that they can do that. 

But if they really wanted to make money, I’d suggest dropping the average price point so that people could choose to buy an event bonus rather than a cup of coffee in the future.

So I went on a first date with someone. Met at a coffee shop. Thought it went well, we connected on a few things, had some laughs. Hugged her goodbye. She messaged me the next day and we were texting casually. During our date we had discussed a few tv shows and we both had said how Arrested Development was worthy of rewatching.

Now as a side story, in the past as I live in a more rural province and my dates could be 1-2 hours away, as a thing to do “together” , sometimes I would suggest me and the girl watch a show together or something (like both starting episodes together in our own homes, casually texting discussing the show during etc). The last 2 girls I dated actually liked that idea and we watched a bunch of stuff together

Anyway so that day I casually said to this woman “think im gonna rewatch arrested development if you wanna watch it too” and she kinda acted weird, basically didnt respond and the next day just hit like on the post. She texted me on and off a bit later that week but I was kind of put off by her behaviour as if I did something weird to her. Anyway she agreed to a 2nd date for that weekend, then on the Friday said something came up (a work Christmas dinner rescheduled) and that we should meet next week. By this point I was kinda checking out but said ok, didnt expect her to keep to it and yeah she didn’t message me later that week so I just unmatched her

Anyway was that really such a weird thing to say to someone? Maybe she thought I was trying to be controlling or something idk, it was just a casual friendly suggestion so we could kinda do something together without being physically together but we just met once so i dunno. Anyway im over it, if she didn’t take it as a sweet gesture she’s not for me. Was just curious what others thought

My wife and I have been stuck in a dead bedroom for almost three years. She doesn't even appreciate anything I do for her. It has been a huge blow to my self esteem bit I'm not someone who likes to whine and complain so I decided to fix it. I was always in decent shape but now I go to the gym twice a day, i don eat sugar or sweets at all. My only source of sugar is fruits. I'm seriously conscious of my food intake.

I'd get her flowers and took her out whenever I could. I even took her out on trips often. Once I took her to this resort abroad and it all went really well she was even laughing at my jokes and everything and when we went back to our room she just looked at me and said ""you probably want sx now right?"" With such a tired look on her face like it was a chore she dreaded. I basically said no and we went to sleep. 

I didn't want to give up I started trying even harder. I got all my clothes tailor made and whenever we go on dates I start preparing for it atleast two days in advance I hop on a calorie deficit and I start a water diet to look as shredded as I could. I've gained almost 30lbs in muscle over the last two years. The only compliments I got were from guys at the gym. I seriously remember feeling like I'm incredibly repulsive and something is seriously wrong with me and that's why she doesn't even wanna touch me anymore. 

I have pretty much given up on stuff but my routines are harder to abandon i still work out like a crazy guy but I dont take her out on dates anymore unless she asks. I spent a lot of time on my phone to take care of my problem with adult movies and I've started following a lot of influencers who post thirst traps. 

Lately I got closer to a coworker(29F) of mine and it started off as just a friendship thing but she started flirting with me and it was just so nice to feel desired after so long and I reciprocated, we started texting and our chats got longer and steamier and I told myself that this is something purely online and it doesn't mean anything but around last month she started pressuring me to meet her outside work and I finally agreed to meet her the day after Christmas. I deluded myself into thinking that we'll just meet for coffee well obviously we did a little more than just having coffee. It was just amazing it wasn't just sx it was actual intimacy we ended up talking for so long after it, it felt amazing. 

Obviously once she left the guilt started seeping in but it's been a few days and it has mostly worn off. My wife seemed a little upset that I didn't take her out anywhere for new year's but I've just been thinking about my coworker. I feel like I'm falling in love with her, she and i are so compatible and she's got a sick sense of humor she even makes jokes at my wife's expense  (she knows I'm married) sometimes during our chats and she even did the same when we met. She's opened up to me so much and I really think she's the one. She even stayed up late to send new year wishes exactly at 12am while my wife was fast asleep by 10 after complaining about having to stay at home on new year's. She's also kind and appreciative she cares about me, she asks me if I ate on time and I've had some back problems in the last two years and she even tells me to be careful with it when I'm working out. She works hard at the job and is independent, she even told me she got me presents for new year's while my wife is leeching off me expecting me to take her out and get her presents. She even works out and wants to join the gym i go to but she has an annual subscription that only ends in January so she's waiting it out. She's really fit while my wife is skinny fat and is a couch potato, I'm really surprised that she's not morbidly obese who knows maybe she'll balloon out in the next few years and i don't wanna end up being her caregiver. I'm just starting to hate my wife now that I know that someone really can appreciate me and I'm not so worthless after all.

Quite new to Austen, basically an entire novice (I watched the 2005 Pride and Prejudice). And am really liking it! So far, as someone who's readings have mostly been focused on grim fantasy, light fantasy, sci-fi thrillers and detective series, I'm really loving the way she's portraying society, people, and even the way they say, and ESPECIALLY her way of narration. It's like sarcasm, wittiness, insights, and at the same time focuses on the main character's (Anne in this case) inner feelings, restraint, and longing. It's very adoring so far, like a warm cup of coffee on Christmas.

Prompt

A photorealistic lifestyle portrait of a beautiful young Asian woman relaxing inside a cozy café by a large window on a rainy day. She is seated comfortably on a leather chair with her legs extended and resting on the window ledge, wearing cuffed blue jeans, black Chelsea boots, and a fitted red sleeveless top. She holds a matte black ceramic mug with visible steam rising from it, suggesting hot coffee or tea. On her left wrist she wears an analog watch.

She has long, naturally flowing black hair, warm natural skin tone, subtle makeup, and a calm, contemplative expression as she gazes out the window. Soft ambient café lighting illuminates her face and upper body, while the background features shallow depth of field with warm bokeh lights inside the café and blurred city traffic and greenery outside the rain-streaked glass.

The composition is cinematic and realistic, shot at eye level with a full-frame camera look, natural proportions, accurate anatomy, and correct head-to-body scale. Textures are highly detailed: fabric weave, leather boots, condensation on the mug, reflections on the window. Color grading is warm and natural with soft contrast. No stylization, no illustration, no cartoon or anime features. Ultra-realistic photography, 35mm lens, f/1.8, high dynamic range, professional lifestyle photography.

hey everyone, figured i'd share some tips for the mercyhurst game on wednesday, 01/03. parking at the ralph is honestly a pain because the actual arena lots are all reserved for champions club members, meaning no general public parking on site. you have to plan on parking off-site and walking or catching a shuttle.  
  
first up, and my favorite insider tip to skip the worst of the traffic coming off i-29/gateway drive, is to check out Prked. it's this app where people right next to the arena rent out their driveways or garage spots for the night. it's usually way cheaper than the campus lots, you skip a ton of the inbound chaos, and you can walk right over in like five minutes. honestly, it's the move to avoid the congestion.  
  
for the official und options, the parking services runs a bunch of event lots. keep in mind that other campus lots, especially north of university avenue, are enforced for permits during game nights, so don't try to sneak into a random student spot unless you want a ticket. enforcement can start as early as 2:00 pm, so don't assume you can get there early and beat the system.  
  
here are the best general admission event lots i found:  
  
\* \*\*lot 62 archives lot (harvard st.)\*\*: this is the cheapest at $10/vehicle. it's credit card only and you have to use the text2park pay feature. it's behind the archives coffee shop, so expect a decent walk.  
\* \*\*lot 102 smhs lot (near the medical school)\*\*: this one is $15/vehicle and accepts either cash or credit card via the text2park option.  
\* \*\*lot 4 wellness center\*\*: this is on the pricier end at $20/vehicle and is cash only.  
  
the biggest thing to remember is that spaces fill up super quick, and traffic gets really busy, especially right before the 6:07 pm puck drop. if you're trying to pay by credit card in any of those lots, look for the signs with the qr code for the text2park feature, and save yourself some time by creating an account ahead of the game. make sure you enter your license plate number exactly right, because they scan them to check payment.  
  
if you are getting dropped off or using a rideshare like uber/lyft, tell them to use the designated drop-off/pick-up area, which is at the southwest entrance or sometimes on 10th ave west. trying to get dropped off anywhere else is a nightmare and a bottleneck for traffic.  
  
hope this helps everyone get to the game smoothly and on time to see the opening face-off. go fighting hawks!",1,1767251131.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

1q0y5lt,https://i.redd.it/bty7etyesoag1.jpeg,The difference between Ken Kaneki & Haise Sasaki,"I was thinking about Haise & Ken, and how they’re the same but different. Two sides of the same coin, mirrors of each other, insert other similar saying here. And then I go to thinking about what the difference was between them, why Haise just FEELS different from Ken. Ergo, the following. 

When I first met Haise, I (like many others) thought that there’s no way he was actually Ken. It’s too obvious. He looks like Ken, he talks in the same way Ken used to, etc. eventually we get that first fight with Nishiki and our suspicions are proven right: Haise IS Kaneki, or at least a version of Kaneki without his memories.

And it’s everywhere. The more time we spend with Haise, the more and more we see Kaneki in him. We sit in his love for books, his appreciation of good coffee, how he treats the Qs.

But… he’s not Kaneki. Something feels off. It’s his memories, or lack there of. This personality Haise has is kind of Kaneki’s, but it’s… hollow. It’s missing more than just his memories. It’s missing experiences. What happens to us in life makes us who we are, for better or worse. 

Haise isn’t Ken, as Haise hasn’t experienced the things and trauma Ken has. In essence, Haise is Ken if he had grown up with love, stability, and friends. Haise is who Ken could’ve been… but never will be. As Ken later says, Haise was a pleasant dream, a wish even. Ken feels complete due to the darkness inside him, while Haise feels like that first snow that doesn’t quite stick.  

But he could turn into the person Ken is under the right conditions, and begins to do just that as he learns more and more about Ken. The snow starts to stick in places.

Ken Kaneki isn’t and cannot become Haise Sasaki. But Haise Sasaki is and could become Ken Kaneki. ",31,1767250952.0,TokyoGhoul,4,0.98,False

First of all thanks for existing, seems to be a nice community here. I suffered from extreme OCD, anxiety, depression and PTSD before I went on Sertraline a bit over a year ago which has changed my life completely. Was really great for a while but as I reached the 200mg dose my tiredness slowly started increasing. In the beginning it was still worth it as a bit of faitigue was better than the nightmare I used to live in. Now it is getting really extreme, I simply cannot get out of bed in the morning, feel so exhausted as if I was 90 years old on chemotherapy. Can´t fall asleep in the evening, can´t wake up in the morning. I also started having insomnia now where I don´t manage to fall asleep until 1AM and then I wake up at 3:30 AM unable to get anymore sleep. I used to help myself with coffee but it also stopped working not too long ago, makes me even more sleepy sometimes. Or sometimes I will wake up at 3AM and have a cup of coffee trying to forcefully start my day and then I fall back asleep again xD. But mostly can not sleep longer than that, I think I. have been getting 3 hrs of sleep/night on average. My psychiatrist says that fatigue is a rare side effect of Zoloft and  that it probably is not the cause of my problems (lol).



Has anyone had experience with going from 200 to 150mg to reduce the tiredness and how was it? I have more responsibilities coming soon and I honestly need to change something because I wont be able to function with the state I am currently in. I also take it in the morning but see that people have had good experiences switching to taking it at night?

1q0xyy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1q0xyy8/to_women_who_dream_about_dating_white_guys_read/,To women who dream about dating white guys - read this,"im seeing this narrative everywhere lately—brown girls wanting to date white guys to escape the “patriarchal/toxic” culture back home. the logic is always that a western guy = liberal, modern, and respectful. basically an 'upgrade.'

but theres a massive blind spot here. when you date someone because you think they are inherently 'better' than your own people, you aren't fighting the patriarchy. you're just trading it for a dynamic where you enter the relationship already feeling inferior. and trust me, guys notice that. and the wrong kind of guy *loves* that.

this isn't theory, i watched this exact dynamic play out in real time.

it reminds me of my time back in college and this white friend of mine (call him Kyle) who was dating this indian chick. I did my undergrad in the us - ive lived in the west before and studied in international schools so apart from my appearance, westerners didnt consider me very ‘ethnic’ or “fobby"" (which is a crucial theme here).

So now Kyle is in our circle, and since me and this other guy are the 2 Indians he shows us photos of this indian girl he says hes talking to - she’s apparently a masters student and comes to the coffee shop on campus where Kyle works pretty often, and he ended up getting her number and talking to her. 

I’ll go through a list of things ‘Kyle’ did that made me super uncomfortable but as a 19 year old back then I honestly didnt care enough and had my own problems to worry about.

* Asking us to teach him hindi phrases which we did, then he comes back laughing about how she laps it up and how it was a masterstroke. 
* Talking about how much of a ‘fob’ she is - in a way that made me say ‘bro she’s not an alien’ but you could tell its just something he could not look past at all.
* Mocking her accent -  this was a constant throughout their time together, he even did it to her face and she joined in and seemed to not mind which was crazy. 
* Them starting to ‘date’ while he opens up to us about how eager she was to make it happen, and well, Kyle wasn’t stupid he could tell she had this inferiority complex and saw him as better simply because he was white (he was an average looking dude, she was genuinely a 8-9/10)
* She cooks for him, he mocks it behind her back. At parties he makes her say things to make others laugh at her accent and the whole dynamic is “she’s so cool and attractive for an indian” and also “she’s a proper indian from india with all her quirks”
* The most digsusting part is probably him discussing her body and coloring with us (I dont want to get into the details but yeah it made me very uncomfortable but his counter was come on I won’t care if you say this about a white girl its not that deep)

This lasted maybe a year - kyle would still party with us, go out etc and only brought her along maybe 2-3 times. His whole thing with her was her availability - how she was always free when he called. 

The breakup from his side was normal - talked about her being overdramatic and too clingy. Thats really all we heard. Later I was chatting with a guy who was also in the masters program and asked about her and he told me how serious she was about this guy and even fought with her parents back home, wanting to make him meet them etc.

before you think this is some rare case of a one-sided relationship - its really not. unless you’re literally Priyanka Chopra or something.

now i know people will say “thats just one anecdotal case” or “my white bf loves my culture”. and yeah, obviously happy couples exist. but even in the “good” relationships, that power imbalance is often lurking if you go in with this mindset.

when you date a guy specifically to escape your culture, or because you think white = modern/better, you are handing him all the power before the first date even happens. you enter the relationship feeling “lucky” to be picked, while he feels “open-minded” for picking you. that dynamic puts you completely at his mercy.

even if he’s a decent guy, if you have that internalized inferiority, you will let slide things you’d never tolerate from an indian guy. you’ll laugh at jokes that should offend you. you’ll compromise on your identity to fit his world because you’re scared of losing the “upgrade.”

dating is always a gamble, but when you view your partner as a prize solely due to his race, you aren't a partner. you’re a fan. and guys like kyle know the difference.",6,1767250265.0,TwentiesIndia,5,0.87,False

Caught the stream where you mentioned needing to learn Spanish for your wife's family.

I wanted to offer to help out—not as a formal tutor, but as a conversational partner. I’m also 33, a native speaker, and own a couple of companies in LATAM, so I feel like we actually have adequately similar brain rot/interests. 

Instead of awkward ""textbook"" scenarios, we can just chat about things we actually care about—marketing strategy, tech, business operations, or just complaining about weight gains and getting old while drinking coffee, but in Spanish. 

If you want to hop on a call for 30 mins a week to practice the casual stuff (and the slang you actually need to survive the in-laws), hit me up. No strings attached, just figured it would be less painful for you than a standard tutor / babble session.",5,1767250040.0,atrioc,0,1.0,False

1q0xun6,https://www.reddit.com/r/brandonsanderson/comments/1q0xun6/i_wrote_my_wedding_vows_as_knights_radiant_oaths/,I wrote my wedding vows as Knights Radiant oaths,"I just got married! I spent the past year writing my vows, taking heavy inspiration from the Knights Radiant oaths, various other Cosmere works, as well as a broad selection of Science Fiction and Fantasy. Here's what I wrote:

If you know me, you know I read a lot of books and you know Jay gets to hear all about them in our daily coffee dates. And I did a read a lot this year: about 25,000 pages. From all of those worlds, all of those characters and ideas, these two quotes made me think of Jay the most. I've taken the liberty to make a few small changes to make them fit a bit better.

This first is by a frog-otter-caterpillar person named Dr. Chef in The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet:

> All you can do—all any of us can do—is work to be something positive. That is a choice that every sapient must make every day of their life. The universe is what we make of it. It's up to you to decide what part you will play. And what I see in you is a person who has a clear idea of what [he] wants to be. You're trying to be someone good.

This next one is from The Wheel of Time as a mentor sends her student out into the world:

> We are always more afraid than we wish to be, but we can always be braver than we expect. Hold on to your heart, and [they] cannot harm what is really you, your heart.

So, my vows. Three years ago Jay told me one of his favorite authors was Brandon Sanderson - who wrote the Mistborn series as well as the end of the Wheel of Time. So for Christmas that year I got him the Year of Sanderson - a collection of new books and themed swag. This led to me finally starting to read Brandon Sanderson, and over the next two years I read about half of his catalogue. This included my favorite series of his, the Stormlight Archive.

What draws me to Stormlight Archive is the foundation of the magic system. Knights Radiant get their magical powers by taking oaths. Most of these aren't universal, but specific to the person saying them. One character repeating the vows of another doesn't do anything if they aren't meaningful for them.

Knights Radiant take up to five oaths as they grow and learn about themselves and what's important to them.

These are mine.

The first is always the same, and comes in three parts.

1.
Life before death. What we do here today has meaning because we are alive only so long before we die. Despite knowing how [life] ends, I will embrace every moment of it.

Strength before weakness. When you are weak and I am strong, I will be there for you, just as I know you will for me when I am weak. And when we are both weak, we will be weak together.

Journey before destination. The most important step a man can take isn't the first one or the last one. It's the next one. And I want to take this next step with you. We're on a journey together. Between who we were, and who we want to be. Both of us.

2.
You will be angry with me, Jay, and I with you. You cannot deal with what you cannot see. I will let you know when I am angry, my husband.

3.
I accept that I will make mistakes.
If I must fall I will rise each time a better man.


4.
I accept that there will be bad days.
I will keep on fighting.
I will love myself, so that I may continue to love others.

5.
I deserve to be happy.
I believe that being with you will make me happy.

And, finally, instead of ""'till death"", I promise you that if life transcends death, I will seek you there. If not, then there too.

Prepare for a Reality Check, Darling.","Ah, the siren song of the internet! It whispers promises of unlimited income, pajama-clad workdays, and an escape from the mundane 9-to-5. Everyone, it seems, wants to [start entrepreneur online](https://startentrepreneureonline.com/), believing it's a golden ticket to a life of perpetual leisure and overflowing bank accounts. Let's be brutally honest, shall we? The glossy Instagram feeds and ""seven-figure in six months"" gurus have painted a rather… optimistic picture of what it truly means to be an entrepreneur. It's less about sipping cocktails on a beach and more about chugging lukewarm coffee at 3 AM while debugging a website.

This isn't to say the dream is entirely a mirage, but rather that the path to entrepreneurial nirvana is paved with more existential dread and technical glitches than most online courses dare to admit. If you're genuinely considering diving headfirst into the digital ocean, buckle up. We're about to dissect the popular myths, expose the inconvenient truths, and perhaps, just perhaps, equip you with a slightly more cynical, yet infinitely more useful, perspective on how to navigate this wild world.

# The Grand Delusion: Why Everyone Thinks They Can Start Entrepreneur Online

It's an epidemic, really. The idea that simply having an internet connection and a vague notion of ""making money"" is enough to launch a thriving digital empire. Social media bombards us with success stories, carefully curated to omit the years of ramen noodles and self-doubt. This creates a powerful, almost irresistible urge to jump on the bandwagon, fueled by the fear of missing out on the next big thing.

The allure is understandable. The traditional career path feels increasingly restrictive, and the idea of being your own boss, setting your own hours, and dictating your own destiny is intoxicating. However, this intoxicating vision often conveniently forgets the part where you're also your own HR department, IT support, marketing team, and chief emotional punching bag. It’s a lot less glamorous when you’re wrestling with spreadsheet formulas instead of negotiating a multi-million-dollar deal.

Many aspiring digital moguls fall victim to the belief that the internet is a magical money tree, requiring minimal effort to shake its bountiful branches. They see the success of others and assume their path was effortless, failing to recognize the relentless grind, the countless failures, and the sheer tenacity required to truly make a mark. It's not just about having an idea; it's about having the grit to see it through when every fiber of your being screams for a return to the safety of a steady paycheck.

# Unpacking the Myth of Effortless Entrepreneurship and the Entrepreneurial Spirit

Let's talk about the ""entrepreneurial spirit."" It's often romanticized as this innate, mystical quality that only a chosen few possess. In reality, it's a cocktail of stubbornness, a high tolerance for ambiguity, and an unhealthy obsession with problem-solving. It's not about being a visionary; it's about being willing to pivot, fail, and get back up again, often looking rather foolish in the process.

The myth of effortless income is perhaps the most insidious. ""Passive income"" has become the holy grail, promising riches with minimal ongoing effort. What they don't tell you is that the ""passive"" part comes \*after\* an immense amount of \*active\* work – building systems, creating content, automating processes – that would make a conventional job look like a vacation. It's less about setting it and forgetting it, and more about setting it, tweaking it, fixing it, and then maybe, just maybe, forgetting about it for a few hours.

True entrepreneurship is a marathon, not a sprint, and often it feels like you're running that marathon uphill, barefoot, in the snow, while simultaneously juggling flaming torches. The ability to embrace discomfort, to learn new skills on the fly, and to make decisions with incomplete information are far more valuable than any ""secret formula"" peddled by online gurus. It’s about being perpetually uncomfortable and strangely enjoying it.

# Navigating the Labyrinth of Business Online Start Online Courses from Dummies

So, you've decided to take the plunge. Naturally, your first instinct is to Google ""Business Online Start Online Courses from Dummies"" or something equally reassuring. And lo and behold, the internet delivers! A veritable cornucopia of courses, each promising to reveal the ""untold secrets"" of online success for a small, non-refundable fee. Be warned: many of these are less about education and more about aspiration marketing.

While some courses offer genuine value, many are simply repackaged common sense, often delivered by individuals whose primary business model is selling courses about how to sell courses. They preach the gospel of ""hustle culture"" and ""mindset shifts,"" which, while not entirely useless, often gloss over the gritty, unsexy details of actual business operations. You'll learn a lot about motivation, but perhaps less about how to integrate a payment gateway or optimize your conversion rates.

Approach these offerings with a healthy dose of skepticism. Look for courses taught by people who have actually \*built\* and \*scaled\* a business in the niche they're teaching, not just those who are skilled at selling the dream. Remember, knowledge is power, but applied knowledge is profitability. And no amount of positive affirmations will fix a broken sales funnel.

# The ""Secret"" Sauce of How to Start an Online Business (Spoiler: It's Not a Secret)

Everyone craves the secret formula, the magical incantation that will unlock online riches. The truth about **how to start an online business** is disappointingly mundane: it's a combination of identifying a problem, creating a solution, finding people who have that problem, and convincing them your solution is worth their money. Revolutionary, I know.

First, find your niche. This isn't about being unique, but about being specific. Don't try to sell everything to everyone. Focus on a particular audience with a particular pain point. The narrower your focus, the easier it is to stand out in a crowded digital marketplace. Think of it as finding a tiny, underserved island instead of trying to conquer a continent.

Next, validate your idea. Before you invest time, money, and your dwindling sanity into building something, make sure people actually \*want\* what you're offering. Talk to potential customers, run surveys, or even launch a minimal viable product (MVP) to test the waters. It's far better to discover nobody wants your artisanal cat sweaters before you've knitted a thousand of them.

# Beyond the Hype: Realities of the Entrepreneurial Journey

The entrepreneurial journey is frequently depicted as a linear ascent to success, with a few minor bumps along the way. In reality, it's more like a roller coaster designed by a sadist, featuring unpredictable loops, sudden drops, and moments where you're convinced the whole thing is about to derail. Expect setbacks, expect failures, and expect days when you question every decision you've ever made.

Cash flow management, surprisingly, is often overlooked by the starry-eyed aspirant. Having a brilliant idea is one thing; having enough money to keep the lights on while you execute it is another. Many promising ventures have crumbled not due to a lack of vision, but a lack of cold, hard capital. Learn to manage your finances like a hawk guarding its nest.

The mental toll is also significant. The constant pressure, the isolation, and the weight of responsibility can be crushing. Building an online business isn't just a professional endeavor; it's a personal one that will test your resilience, your relationships, and your sanity. Develop coping mechanisms, find a support network, and don't be afraid to step away from the screen occasionally.

# The Perils of 'Passive Income' and Other Fairy Tales

Let's address the elephant in the digital room: ""passive income."" It's a marketing term so seductive it borders on witchcraft. The idea of money flowing into your account while you sleep, travel, or perfect your sourdough starter is incredibly appealing. However, the reality is a little more… active.

True passive income streams – like royalties from a book or rent from a property – require significant upfront work or capital. Online, creating something that generates income without constant attention means building robust systems, automating processes, and a whole lot of initial heavy lifting. Think of it as building a self-sustaining ecosystem; it requires immense effort to set up, and even then, Mother Nature (or the internet) occasionally throws a wrench in the works.

Many ""passive income"" models, like affiliate marketing or drop-shipping, are anything but passive. They require continuous content creation, SEO optimization, customer service, and market research. It’s less about doing nothing and more about front-loading an astronomical amount of effort, then continuing to maintain it with strategic, albeit less intensive, input. It's not a magic money tree; it's a very high-maintenance garden.

# Choosing Your Digital Battlefield: Niche, Market, and Your Inevitable Existential Crisis

Before you even think about building a website or crafting your first sales pitch, you need to choose your digital battlefield. This involves selecting a niche and understanding your market. It's where many aspiring entrepreneurs get stuck, paralyzed by the fear of choosing the wrong path, or, worse, choosing a path that's already oversaturated with digital gladiators.

Your niche isn't just a topic; it's a specific problem you're solving for a specific group of people. The narrower, the better. Instead of ""health and fitness,"" consider ""fitness routines for busy single parents over 40."" This focus allows you to speak directly to your audience, build authority, and avoid getting lost in the noise. It also makes your marketing efforts infinitely more targeted and less like shouting into a hurricane.

Understanding your market goes beyond demographics. It's about psychology. What are their deepest fears, their most urgent desires, their daily frustrations? If you can articulate their problems better than they can, you're halfway to selling them a solution. This deep dive often leads to a bit of an existential crisis, as you confront your own biases and assumptions, but it's a necessary step in building something truly valuable.

# Marketing Mayhem: How to Shout into the Void (Effectively, Supposedly)

You've built it. Now what? The internet is a vast, noisy place, and getting noticed is akin to making your voice heard in a stadium full of screaming fans. Marketing is not a suggestion; it's a fundamental requirement. And it's often where the ironic critic in me truly shines, observing the often desperate and sometimes hilarious attempts to capture attention.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is your digital breadcrumb trail, guiding potential customers to your doorstep. It's a complex, ever-changing beast that requires patience, consistency, and a willingness to constantly adapt to Google's latest whims. Don't expect instant results; think of it as planting a tree and waiting for it to bear fruit, while simultaneously battling digital squirrels trying to steal your nuts.

Social media marketing requires a delicate balance of authenticity and strategic self-promotion. It's about building a community, not just broadcasting sales pitches. And paid advertising? That's where you throw money at the internet in the hope that some of it sticks to your ideal customer. It's a science, an art, and occasionally, an expensive lesson in what \*not\* to do. Be prepared to analyze, optimize, and occasionally mourn your ad spend.

# The Art of Not Giving Up (Or At Least Pretending To)

If there's one piece of advice that truly transcends the sarcastic veneer, it's this: don't give up. Or, at the very least, become exceptionally skilled at pretending you haven't. The entrepreneurial journey is littered with moments of doubt, frustration, and the overwhelming desire to throw your laptop out the window and apply for a stable job with benefits. This is normal. This is part of the process.

Success in the online world rarely happens overnight. It's the cumulative result of consistent effort, learning from failures, and adapting to change. The ability to persevere, even when the data looks bleak and your motivation wanes, is what separates the dreamers from the doers. Find your personal wellspring of stubbornness and tap into it regularly.

Remember that every ""overnight success"" you see online likely has a decade of unseen grinding behind it. So, when the going gets tough, and it will, remind yourself why you chose to embark on this audacious journey in the first place. Then, take a deep breath, perhaps a sarcastic chuckle at the absurdity of it all, and get back to work. Your digital empire isn't going to build itself, and neither is your ability to truly understand the relentless, often thankless, yet ultimately rewarding process of becoming an entrepreneur.",1,1767249244.0,u_ForeignTown1187,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for a male perspective on something that’s been confusing me.

There’s a guy I see regularly at my gym. We don’t know each other outside of that e.g no numbers, no socials, nothing like that.

Here’s what’s happened over time:

1. He was the first one to notice me. Lots of looking from across the gym before we ever spoke.
2. Eventually he started saying hi first, waving, nodding, etc.
3. Sometimes he’ll move to work out near me or end up in my general area.
4. I asked his name once, he asked for mine too. When I said it, he smiled, looked away, and kind of mouthed my name quietly (which stood out to me).
5. He still consistently waves when he sees me, sometimes pretty noticeably.
6. BUT when we’re close, he often avoids eye contact and doesn’t really talk.
7. He chats easily with other guys at the gym, so he’s not generally shy.
8. When I try light conversation (“how was your workout?”), he’s polite but brief and usually exits fast.
9. He’s done a couple small friendly things (like offering me a sip of his protein shake).
10. He STILL looks at me fairly often when he’s doing his workouts. 

So that’s where I’m confused. He notices me and acknowledges me, but seems uncomfortable actually interacting beyond that.

My questions:
1. Does this sound like attraction mixed with hesitation, or just friendliness?
2. Is this more like “noticed someone but decided not to pursue”?
3. When a guy behaves like this, is it basically a signal to keep things gym-only?
4. Would asking for clarity (like coffee) feel intrusive, or would you expect the other person to let it be?
5. If you were him, what would you want the other person to do — step back or address it?

Not trying to force anything, just want to understand what this usually means so I can act normal and move on if needed.

drinking was something i always overdid. i would hit the perfect amount of socially drunk and wake up with no recollection of how i got home. i would always say yes to another drink more, forever chasing a buzz i could not keep.

i wish that memory gaps were a warning for me -- they weren't. i used alcohol to cope with things i felt i could not handle. alcohol wasn't a solve for the problems, just a brief escape. problems still exist when i sober up.



in january 2023, i was severely depressed, felt socially more alone than ever in my life, and was actively drinking.

unfortunately in january 2026, i am still severely depressed, feel more socially alone now than ever, and do not drink.



it was not and is not easy. i am still learning tools to help me in my journey.

i guided myself thru a SMART recovery workbook, and it was one of the biggest aids in making me feel less crazy for having the feelings i feel. it is hard to see the long term cost when the short term gain seems so worth it.

some key takeaways i found in it were to do as much as you can to deny delay/giving into drinking alcohol. it takes practice, patience, and persistence.

using other drinks as a replacement has been a key strategy in my life. i radically accepted any soda into my life. if i want to get a coffee, it ends up being cheaper than my alcohol tab. i try to leverage the urge with something to deny it or delay it if i can't handle the discomfort.

some people say addicts have the strangest ways of reasoning what they do, and it can be true. i also find myself laughing a bit because i allow myself to eat Chick-fil-a as a person in the LGBT community because it ""is not as harmful for me as alcohol"" (i mean it as a lighthearted thing).

1q0xn83,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0xn83,On my 4th Rolife kit and I think I hate it 😬,"Hi! This is my first post on this sub but I have read a bit and lurked some. A while back, I caved to Amazon showing me Cathy’s Flower House and gave it a try. I loved it! I proceeded to then do the Leisure Time Tea Room and then the Baking Kitchen. So much fun and they are all so cute! (See pics) 

Anyways, today I was thinking I would buy another one to work on over the holiday weekend and went to Michael’s and ending up picking Simon’s Coffee. And I now realize that the first three kits I did were apparently the “new” style with no glue, die cut paper, everything labeled, etc. 

Simon’s Coffee is not this way 😬 I’ve completed just the first item which is the bar/counter so I’m still on page ONE of the book and it took forever. Honestly, if the first kit I did was like this I don’t think I would have got hooked on these. But I’m actually considering just throwing this kit away and trying to figure out which ones are the new kind and only doing those. I know it seems like there are some people who really dislike how “easy” the snap together ones are but I actually really prefer them and it’s great to just be able to spend a lazy weekend afternoon building something and then being done with it.

I treated my obesity like a ""toxic employee,"" fired my motivation, and lost 77lbs in 12 months","I spent my 30s purely grinding. I didn’t go to university, so I always felt like I had to outwork everyone else just to prove I belonged in the room. It worked on paper I made it to Senior Manager in a safety critical industry and built a property portfolio but the cost was my health. I was running my career on strict data and efficiency, but I was running my body on stress, takeout, and zero sleep.
It hit me properly last year. I was 265lbs (120kg) and I realized I was a massive hypocrite. I spend my days at work telling my team they can never ignore a warning light or cut corners on a project, yet I was ignoring every single ""Check Engine"" light my own body was flashing at me. I was efficient at work, but I was bankrupt physically.
So I stopped trying to get ""motivated."" Motivation is a liability. It’s that unreliable employee who calls in sick the moment it rains. I decided to fire my motivation and just run a boring, cold audit on my life instead. I tracked my time and my calories like a financial budget and found I was bleeding 15 hours a week on ""doomscrolling"" and consuming hundreds of hidden calories in coffees and snacks.
I didn't do anything magic. I just set up standard operating procedures for myself. The gym wasn't a choice anymore, it was a mandatory meeting with the CEO (me), and you don't skip meetings just because you're tired. I dropped 77lbs (35kg) in 12 months just by being boring and consistent.
I actually built a specific ""Life Audit"" spreadsheet to track all this without the guesswork. I’m heading out for New Year's plans now, but if anyone actually wants to see the boring admin side of how I did it, just let me know in the comments. If there's enough interest, I'll clean up the file and post the full breakdown next week.

1q0xley,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1q0xley/best_vpn_for_vix_mexico_in_the_usa/,Best VPN for ViX Mexico in the USA,"Missing *La Casa de los Famosos México* because you're in the States? You're not alone. ViX Mexico hosts some of the best Spanish-language content out there—exclusive telenovelas, Liga MX matches, and reality shows you can't find on the US version. The catch? Most of it's locked to Mexican IP addresses only.

I've spent weeks testing VPNs to see which ones actually work with ViX Mexico. Not all VPNs can bypass these geo-blocks, and some that claim they can are painfully slow. After connecting to dozens of Mexican servers and streaming everything from live soccer to drama series, I found three VPNs that consistently deliver.

# Why Is ViX Mexico Geo-Blocked in the USA?

Here's the frustrating part. ViX operates in both the US and Mexico, but the content libraries are completely different. TelevisaUnivision, which owns ViX, licenses content separately for each region. Mexican reality shows, certain telenovelas, and live sports broadcasts stay locked to Mexico because of these licensing deals.

When you try accessing Mexican-exclusive content from a US IP address, ViX's servers detect your location and show an error. No amount of refreshing will fix it—your IP address gives you away instantly.

**What content is Mexico-exclusive?**

* *La Casa de los Famosos México* (24/7 live stream)
* Liga MX live matches and highlights
* Mexican telenovelas not licensed for US broadcast
* Regional news programs and talk shows
* Certain ViX Premium originals produced for the Mexican market

The only way around this? A VPN that assigns you a Mexican IP address. But not just any VPN—you need one with servers in Mexico that ViX hasn't blacklisted.

# Best VPNs for ViX Mexico: Top 3 Tested and Ranked

I tested 15 different VPNs over three weeks, connecting to Mexican servers and streaming ViX content daily. Here's what actually works.

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall for ViX Mexico

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**Mexican Servers**|30 physical servers 🏆|
|**Speed Retention**|96% (fast enough for 4K) 🏆|
|**Protocol**|NordLynx (WireGuard-based)|
|**Streaming Quality**|Zero buffering, instant playback 🏆|
|**Price**|$2.99/month (2-year plan)|
|**Devices**|10 simultaneous connections|

**Why I recommend it:** NordVPN crushed the competition in my speed tests. Connecting to its Mexico City server took three seconds, and I streamed *La Casa de los Famosos* in full HD without a single buffer. That's because of NordLynx, their custom protocol built on WireGuard that's ridiculously fast.

**Streaming performance:** I tested live Liga MX matches during peak hours—weekends when everyone's watching. No lag, no quality drops. The 24/7 live stream of reality shows played perfectly, which is saying something since live streams usually choke VPN connections.

**Security features:**

* AES-256 encryption (same standard banks use)
* Automatic kill switch (blocks internet if VPN drops)
* No-logs policy audited by PwC
* Obfuscated servers (hides VPN usage from ISPs)

**What I didn't love:** The monthly price is steep at $12.99 if you don't commit to the 2-year plan. And occasionally, one of the 30 Mexican servers gets congested during popular matches—though switching to another fixes it instantly.

>💡 **Pro Tip:** Enable the kill switch before streaming. If your VPN connection drops, it'll block your internet completely, preventing ViX from seeing your real US IP address. Saved me from getting region-locked mid-episode.

**Verdict:** If you're serious about watching ViX Mexico regularly, NordVPN is the smart investment. Fast, reliable, and 30 servers give you options when one's crowded.

**Get NordVPN →** \[77% off 2-year plan with 3 extra months free\]

# 2. Surfshark – Best Budget Option with Unlimited Devices

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**Mexican Servers**|4 servers in Mexico|
|**Speed Retention**|94% (excellent for HD)|
|**Protocol**|WireGuard|
|**Connections**|Unlimited devices 🏆|
|**Price**|$1.99/month (2-year plan) 🏆|

**Why it's worth considering:** Surfshark costs less than a coffee, and you can connect every device you own—phones, tablets, smart TVs, your roommate's laptop. No limits. For families or households splitting the cost, that's unbeatable value.

**The catch:** Only 4 Mexican servers. During my testing, I occasionally hit server congestion during prime-time hours (7-10 PM EST). Switching servers helped, but with fewer options, you might experience brief slowdowns when everyone's streaming.

**Where it excels:**

* CleanWeb blocks ads and malware (cleaner streaming experience)
* Camouflage Mode hides VPN usage from your ISP
* Override GPS location (useful on mobile devices)
* Works perfectly with ViX on smart TVs and streaming sticks

I used Surfshark on my Fire TV Stick to stream Mexican telenovelas on my living room TV. Setup took five minutes, and the quality stayed at 1080p throughout. The unlimited connections meant my wife could watch on her iPad simultaneously without issues.

**Verdict:** If you're on a budget or need to cover multiple devices, Surfshark delivers solid performance at half the price of premium options.

**Try Surfshark →** \[87% off + 3 free months\]

# 3. IPVanish – Fast Speeds with Solid Mexican Server Network

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**Mexican Servers**|Multiple servers in Mexico City|
|**Speed Retention**|92% average|
|**Protocol**|WireGuard, OpenVPN|
|**Connections**|Unlimited|
|**Price**|$2.19/month|

**What stands out:** IPVanish owns its entire server infrastructure—no third-party rentals. That means better security and more control over server performance. During testing, I found IPVanish particularly good for torrenting while connected to Mexican servers, if that's your thing.

**Streaming performance:** Solid HD quality on ViX Mexico. I didn't experience the instant playback that NordVPN delivered, but after a 2-3 second buffer, streams ran smoothly. Live sports worked well without major interruptions.

**Where it falls short:** The app interface feels dated compared to NordVPN and Surfshark. Not a dealbreaker, but if you value sleek design, you'll notice. Also, customer support response times were slower in my experience—averaging 15-20 minutes for live chat.

**Verdict:** A reliable middle-ground option. Not the fastest, not the cheapest, but consistently delivers access to ViX Mexico without drama.

# VPN Comparison: At a Glance

|VPN|Mexican Servers|Speed|Price/Month|Devices|Best For|Winner|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|30 servers|96% retention|$2.99|10|Overall performance|🏆🏆🏆|
|**Surfshark**|4 servers|94% retention|$1.99|Unlimited|Budget + families|🏆|
|**IPVanish**|Multiple|92% retention|$2.19|Unlimited|Owned infrastructure|🏆|

# How to Watch ViX Mexico from the USA (Step-by-Step)

Ready to watch? Here's exactly how to set this up, even if you've never used a VPN before.

**Step 1: Get a VPN with Mexican servers**

Subscribe to NordVPN (my top recommendation). The entire signup takes maybe 3 minutes:

* Visit the NordVPN website
* Choose the 2-year plan ($2.99/month)
* Enter your email and payment details
* Confirm your purchase

You'll get a confirmation email with your login credentials.

**Step 2: Download and install the VPN app**

NordVPN has apps for everything—Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Fire TV, you name it.

* On your phone: Download from the App Store or Google Play
* On your computer: Download the installer from NordVPN's website
* On Fire TV/Smart TV: Search ""NordVPN"" in your device's app store

Installation is automatic. Just follow the prompts.

**Step 3: Connect to a Mexican server**

Open the NordVPN app and sign in with your email and password.

You'll see a map or server list. Here's what to do:

* Click the **search bar**
* Type ""Mexico""
* Choose **Mexico City** (or any Mexican server)
* Click **Connect**

The connection usually takes 2-5 seconds. You'll see a green ""Connected"" status when it's active.

>⚠️ **Important:** Don't skip the kill switch. In NordVPN settings, enable the ""Kill Switch"" toggle. This prevents your real IP from leaking if the VPN disconnects unexpectedly.

**Step 4: Clear your browser cookies (crucial step)**

This one's easy to forget, but it matters. ViX stores location data in browser cookies. If you don't clear them, the site might still think you're in the US.

**On Chrome/Edge:**

* Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
* Select ""Cookies and other site data""
* Choose ""All time""
* Click ""Clear data""

**On Safari:**

* Go to Preferences → Privacy
* Click ""Manage Website Data""
* Search for ""ViX""
* Remove all ViX-related data

**Step 5: Access ViX Mexico**

Now the fun part. With your VPN connected and cookies cleared:

1. Open your browser
2. Go to **vix.com**
3. Click **Iniciar sesión** (Sign in) or create a new account
4. Browse to **ViX Premium** if you want access to exclusive content
5. Search for *La Casa de los Famosos México* or any Mexican show

The content should load immediately. If you still see an error, disconnect the VPN, reconnect to a different Mexican server, and clear cookies again.

**Step 6: Start streaming**

That's it. You're watching Mexican content as if you were in Mexico City. The VPN runs in the background—no need to touch it unless you disconnect.

# Troubleshooting: What to Do When ViX Blocks Your VPN

VPNs don't always work perfectly on the first try. Here's how to fix common issues I encountered during testing.

# Problem: ""ViX is not available in your region"" error

**What's happening:** ViX detected your VPN and blocked the IP address.

**Solution:**

1. Disconnect from the current Mexican server
2. Connect to a **different Mexican server** (NordVPN has 30 options)
3. Clear browser cookies again
4. Refresh the ViX page

This worked 95% of the time in my tests. ViX blocks specific IPs, not the entire VPN service.

# Problem: Stream buffers constantly or quality drops

**What's happening:** The Mexican server you're on is congested with too many users.

**Quick fixes:**

* Try a different Mexican server (less congested = faster speeds)
* Switch from WireGuard to OpenVPN protocol (in VPN settings)
* Close other apps using bandwidth on your device
* Restart your router and reconnect to the VPN

I found NordVPN's Mexico City #23 server had the best speeds during peak hours. Surfshark users should try rotating through all 4 servers to find the fastest.

# Problem: VPN connects but ViX still shows US content

**What's happening:** Cookies or GPS data are overriding your VPN location.

**Solutions:**

* Clear **all browser data**, not just cookies
* Disable location services on your phone/tablet
* Use **incognito/private browsing mode**
* Restart the ViX app completely (mobile users)

On mobile devices, especially Android, I had to disable GPS location entirely. ViX's app checks both IP address and GPS coordinates.

# Problem: Video plays but audio is out of sync

**What's happening:** This is usually a VPN protocol issue, not ViX.

**Fix:**

* Switch from WireGuard to OpenVPN in your VPN settings
* Lower video quality manually (from 4K to 1080p)
* Refresh the page mid-stream

This happened twice during my testing with Surfshark. Switching to OpenVPN fixed it immediately.

>🔒 **Security Note:** Never use free VPNs for streaming. I tested three popular free VPNs (ProtonVPN free tier, Windscribe, TunnelBear) and none successfully unblocked ViX Mexico. Plus, free VPNs often log your data and sell it to third parties. Not worth the privacy risk.

# Can I Watch ViX Premium Content from the USA?

Yes, but you'll need both a VPN **and** a valid payment method.

ViX Premium costs $5.99/month (with ads) or $8.99/month (ad-free) in Mexico. The problem? Their payment system requires a Mexican credit card or iTunes/Google Play account set to Mexico.

**Workaround options:**

**Option 1: Use a US account with VPN**

* Connect to a Mexican VPN server
* Sign up for ViX Premium using your US credit card
* Some users report this works, though it's hit-or-miss

**Option 2: Purchase through mobile app stores**

* Change your Apple ID region to Mexico
* Add a payment method (gift cards work)
* Download ViX and subscribe through in-app purchase

**Option 3: Subscribe through Amazon Prime Video Channels** As of 2025, you can add ViX Premium to your existing Amazon Prime subscription. This bypasses the geo-restriction on payment processing entirely. You'll still need a VPN to watch Mexican-exclusive content, but payment is simple.

I went with the Amazon route. Much easier than changing app store regions or dealing with payment errors.

# What Can You Watch on ViX Mexico That's Not on ViX USA?

The Mexican library has exclusive content you can't access with a US IP. Here's what I found most interesting during testing:

# Exclusive Reality Shows

* **La Casa de los Famosos México** – 24/7 live stream of celebrities living together (think Big Brother but spicier)
* Regional Mexican reality competitions not licensed for US broadcast

# Live Sports

* **Liga MX** matches (Mexican soccer league)
* Highlights and analysis shows
* Some international matches only broadcast in Mexico

# Telenovelas and Dramas

* Mexican productions that haven't been licensed for US streaming
* Earlier release dates for certain series (Mexico gets them first)
* Uncensored versions of shows edited for US audiences

# News and Talk Shows

* Mexican national news programs
* Regional talk shows and morning programs
* Political coverage focused on Mexican politics

Worth noting: ViX USA has plenty of great content too. The Mexican library just offers regional exclusives that make a VPN worthwhile if you're specifically interested in Mexican programming.

# Is Using a VPN Legal for ViX Mexico?

**Short answer:** Yes, VPNs are completely legal in both the US and Mexico.

**Longer answer:** Using a VPN to access geo-restricted content exists in a gray area. It's not illegal—no law prohibits it. But it does violate ViX's Terms of Service, which state content should only be accessed from allowed regions.

What does this mean in practice? ViX might block your VPN connection if they detect it. They're not going to sue you or report you to authorities. Worst case? They deny you access, and you switch to a different server.

I've been using VPNs to access regional streaming content for years across dozens of platforms. Never had any legal issues. The streaming service either works or it doesn't—that's the extent of consequences.

>💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** If you already pay for ViX Premium in the US, you can access Mexican content with just a VPN—no additional subscription needed. The premium account works across regions; you're just changing which content library you see.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need ViX Premium to watch Mexican content?**  
No. ViX offers tons of free content in both the US and Mexican libraries. Premium gets you ad-free viewing and exclusive shows, but free ViX works fine with a VPN. I watched *La Casa de los Famosos* for free (with ads) using just NordVPN.

**Will ViX ban my account for using a VPN?**  
I haven't heard of a single case of ViX banning accounts for VPN usage. They block VPN IP addresses, not user accounts. If they detect your VPN, you'll see an error message, not an account suspension. Switch servers and you're back in business.

**Can I watch on my TV or streaming device?**  
Absolutely. All three VPNs I recommend (NordVPN, Surfshark, IPVanish) have apps for:

* Fire TV Stick
* Android TV
* Apple TV
* Roku (via router setup)
* Smart TVs (Samsung, LG)

I tested NordVPN on my Fire TV Stick and Surfshark on my Android TV box. Both worked perfectly for streaming ViX Mexico on the big screen.

**Why won't free VPNs work with ViX Mexico?**  
Free VPNs have three fatal problems:

1. **No Mexican servers** (or very few that are overcrowded)
2. **Slow speeds** that make streaming impossible
3. **IP addresses already blacklisted** by streaming services

I tested ProtonVPN's free tier—has no Mexican servers at all. Windscribe has one Mexican server that's constantly overloaded. Free VPNs work for basic browsing, not streaming.

**Which VPN is fastest for ViX Mexico?**  
In my speed tests, NordVPN averaged 96% speed retention, meaning I only lost 4% of my base internet speed. Surfshark came in second at 94%, and IPVanish at 92%. All three are fast enough for 4K streaming without buffering.

**Can I use the same VPN for other streaming services?**  
Yes. NordVPN, Surfshark, and IPVanish all work with Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO Max across various regions. I regularly use NordVPN to access Netflix libraries in different countries. One subscription covers all your streaming needs.

**What if my VPN stops working with ViX?**  
Streaming services constantly update their VPN detection. If your VPN stops working:

1. Update your VPN app to the latest version
2. Contact customer support—they'll recommend specific servers
3. Try obfuscated servers (available in NordVPN)

VPN providers play cat-and-mouse with streaming services. Reputable VPNs like NordVPN quickly adapt when servers get blocked.

# Bottom Line: Best VPN for ViX Mexico

After weeks of testing, **NordVPN** is the clear winner for watching ViX Mexico from the USA. It's fast, reliable, and those 30 Mexican servers mean you always have options when one gets crowded. The NordLynx protocol made streaming *La Casa de los Famosos* smoother than my regular internet connection.

**Best for most people:** NordVPN ($2.99/month)  
**Best for budget:** Surfshark ($1.99/month)  
**Best for owned infrastructure:** IPVanish ($2.19/month)

All three work consistently with ViX Mexico, handle HD and 4K streaming without buffering, and protect your privacy with strong encryption. You can't go wrong with any of them, but NordVPN's combination of speed, server count, and features makes it worth the extra dollar per month.

I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

It was close to midnight, and I was stewing on a few things, and not in a productive, slow-cooked way. Whisky has a talent for that. It loosens your grip on moral judgment while convincing you that whatever idea arrives next is not only sensible but well deserved.  
  
I opened ChatGPT and asked a simple question. What paperwork do I need to go to Bali?  
  
The answer came back neat and reassuring. Passport sorted. Six months validity, blank pages, all good. Re-entry visa. Tick. e-VOA. Bali tourist levy. Customs and health declarations. Insurance. An eSIM.  
  
My new AI travel agent produced a list that didn’t seem reckless. It was administrative, which has a way of making even the dumbest ideas seem grown-up.  
  
So with that in mind, I booked a return flight to Bali. The departure time was ten hours away.  
  
My knowledge of Bali, up until that point, extended no further than Bintang singlets, loud Australians, and the vague cultural memory of Schapelle Corby. So I went back to my AI travel agent and fed it my flight times. I told it I had roughly a day and a half and one firm request. No Aussie bogans.  
  
Sanur, it said. Calm. Older. Beachy. Civilised.  
  
It gave me a hotel. It found me a guide for a day trip to Ubud. Without questioning any of it, I booked both. At this point, resistance felt pointless.  
  
By 1.30am, the whisky was gone. I packed a backpack with two t-shirts, underwear, socks, and my passport. That was it. Packing complete.  
  
Five hours later, running on fumes and nervous excitement, I was in an Uber on the way to the airport. The familiar aftertaste of fermented grains and misplaced confidence lingered, but the die was cast.  
  
A few hours after that, I landed in a country where I didn’t know how to say hello or thank you. I turned on my eSIM, hunted for a charger that would fit my adapter, and looked for a place to exchange Australian dollars.  
  
“No commission. Same, same.”  
  
This phrase appeared everywhere, delivered with a smile that discouraged follow-up questions. I handed over my cash and was politely given a thick stack of 100,000 rupiah notes. It was only then that I realised I had no idea what the currency was actually worth.  
  
For the moment, it didn’t matter. I just needed to get to my accommodation.  
  
Outside the airport, a man approached me asking if I needed a taxi. I did, but I wasn’t about to climb into a car with someone who looked like they’d just clocked off from a factory floor and decided to freelance as transport.  
  
I must have looked lost, because another man appeared.  
  
“You want real taxi? Follow me.”  
  
He was wearing a blue polo with the word TAXI printed on the back. Official enough, I thought. He led me to a line of identical blue shirts and one man holding an iPad and an EFTPOS machine.  
  
“Where you go?”  
  
I showed him my phone.  
  
“Oh. Sanur.”  
  
The pause that followed made me wonder if blind faith in an algorithm had finally caught up with me.  
  
“Is it far?”  
  
He showed me a laminated price chart.  
  
“Three hundred and ten thousand.”  
  
I had no idea if this was cheap, expensive, or daylight robbery. I only knew I needed to get there.  
  
“You take card?”  
  
If I was going to get scammed, it may as well be the bank’s money.  
  
Bali traffic is something else entirely. It looks chaotic, but it functions with a strange, collective discipline. Scooters flow around cars like water around rocks. Lanes are optional. Horns are used not in anger, but as gentle warnings. There is no road rage because there is no point.  
  
Everyone takes responsibility for everyone else, because they have to. Otherwise, nothing would move.  
  
I sat there grinning like an idiot, watching entire families balanced on 150cc scooters, turning gridlock into a kind of ballet. Australians could learn a lot from the way Balinese traffic works. Less entitlement, more awareness, and less me-first attitude.  
  
We eventually pulled up at my digs. Peneeda View Beach Hotel. Not a hotel in the way Australians mean hotel, it’s more of a low-key resort.  
  
At check-in, I was greeted by a smiling man with careful English. We made small talk, mostly to cover the gaps where language failed us both. He took a copy of my passport, I signed a few forms, and he showed me the total cost of my stay.  
  
The number was enormous.  
  
“Do you take card?” I asked, smiling again, now fully aware I probably should have worked out the exchange rate earlier.  
  
Turns out two million rupiah isn’t that much after all.  
  
And just like that, I was standing in a town I’d never heard of, in a country I knew embarrassingly little about, beyond drunk Australians and cheap beer.  
  
I opened Google Maps. The beach was five minutes away, and the shops were right outside my door. It was 4.30 in the afternoon, and I hadn’t eaten since lunchtime the day before.  
  
So I went out to fix that.

Can you tolerate these foods? 
- low fat / fat free cottage cheese 
- extra lean ground beef 
- broccoli 
- fruits (if yes , which ones? ) 
- fish (what kind?) 
- can you tolerate any cheese? 
- can you tolerate any lentils or beans ? Really miss a good lentil salad. 
- black tea? I was such a coffee person but alas. 

What are you guys having for breakfast ? I don’t do oatmeal anymore. 

If anyone has an easy chicken soup slow cooker recipe, please help out. 

Thank you!

Are there any speech pathologists (regardless of whether you work in paediatrics or geriatrics) open to being messaged about what work is like here? When I'm back in the country I'll get you a coffee/bake you something!

Am not looking for high salaries comparable to Sydney/Melbourne so long as I can afford rent and necessities. I'm mostly looking for speech pathology jobs where there is a nurturing environment for a fresh slp graduate to learn, make mistakes, and grow clinically without ridiculous KPIs hanging over.  Work-life balance would be lovely too since I hope to stay put and contribute for a good few years at least.

I have the visa prep sorted out so am just trying to figure out whether jobs with the above traits exist here in Hobart. I cant drive due to my disability so I'm looking at mainly clinic-based/hospital-based/school-based/aged care-based settings.",4,1767248601.0,hobart,6,0.75,False

1q0xj54,https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/1q0xj54/were_ditching_echo_shows/,We're ditching Echo Shows...,"We just installed security cameras, several smart switches, and are consolidating control of ""smart"" devices that we'd normally control via Echo Shows, Dots, etc.  What started as a need for a kiosk for our Arlo cameras is progressing into us cleaning up our night stands, coffee tables, counters.  Echo Show devices are way over priced for small displays & limited functionality.   


We're opting to replace our Echo Shows with budget Android tablets for ease of use, portability, and flexibility to serve other purposes.  e.g. voice control of smart home via Alexa and Google, basic streaming of music & video, controlling our TV, light gaming, electronic picture frame/slide show.  

Any recommendations for budget tablets to meet our needs?  Under $150 each, 8.x to 10.x inches size, software and security update availability.  Availability of protective cases that can serve as a kickstand / easel.  Under $100 would be awesome but we get what we pay for, right?   

We're a Samsung mobile & Lenovo pc family but they aren't cheap.  Perhaps something like the Samsung A9+ line if it were to more future proof with updates.    ECOPAD, Alldocube, Xiaoxin, etc???? 

No Amazon Fire or Apple iPads for the obvious reasons.  ",9,1767248572.0,smarthome,3,0.91,False
