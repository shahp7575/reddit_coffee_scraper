SORRY LONG POST:

I’ve been noticing a mainly positive effect now that I’ve been taking adhd meds(concerta, 40mg) . My rsd has gone down a LOT, which is mostly good.. but I think it also makes me less afraid to speak my mind bc I’m not afraid of the person disliking my answer and then being upset with me for whatever reason. ..because of this i think it makes me more blunt/accidentally rude ?? Even bitchy sometimes? Like. Ok so: I’m 20,and my bf is 22, we’ve been together for around 2 years. My bf was talking to me about finances earlier today and how he doesn’t have a lot of money saved up as a buffer after I started talking about how much debt I’d be in after tuition. He told me this right AFTER he got us coffee on a little date. I immediately felt guilty, even though he offered to pay. (He’s in a worse spot than me financially, but im also a college student who’s paying their way thru college aswell) Anyways, I essentially told him he should stop offering to pay for dates so often(im fine w not going on dates that cost money, a hike will suffice, AND I am willing to pay too) and to stop going out and ordering fast food so much bc those things will eat away at his finances. I already know he spends money on video games pretty often, so it’s like, choose one or the other. Fast food/paying for dates or buying steam games until he’s got a solid amount in savings….and I think I annoyed him. In the past, unmedicated, I probably woudlve just told him I’m sorry he’s struggling, and that it wasn’t his fault. I’m not sure if my advice was the thing that upset him or my tone, but I immediately felt his energy change and I was like… ohhh shit. And I apologized immediately. Anyways, he dropped me off at class afterwards and now I’m just sitting and stewing on it. I already texting him a big apology and he said he wasnt mad or anything, but I still think I was rude. This blunt type of speaking has happened a few times, and I feel like such a bad person afterwards. It’s either I’m a chronic people pleaser to avoid hurting people’s feelings, or I’m a blunt asshole. IDK HOW TO COMBAT THIS. I thought meds were supposed to make me less impulsive.. so I didn’t know this would be an issue.
Anyone else have a similar experience??",1,1757528065.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1ndlvfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ndlvfw/touchexpress_impress_with_great_discounts_vs/,Touch/Express Impress with great discounts vs. Bambino Plus/Touch Impress with good discounts [CAD $2000],"Newb to espresso making here but have done quite a bit of research so far. Would love some input from this sub. 

My husband and I both like milk based drinks. Most days we order flat white with a medium roast and lactose free milk. We have a k-cup machine but it just tastes nasty. So we often just go to our local cafes to pay for our flat whites. Cost is definitely adding up. 

We are now looking for an espresso machine that both of us can use at home, and we can get the beans locally. We are “ok” willing to do some manual work, but it’s not always possible with two kids at home. So I think most of the time we would just want to press a few buttons and get it done. Been looking at the semi-auto machines due to the fact that we want flexibility and quality coffee. And my husband would want to spend less time fiddling with settings while I’m more of a nerd. 

I’ve narrowed it down to a few options. They are all 20% off right now with the Breville sales, but we also have additional employee discounts on a few of these which is great, but it also makes the decision harder. We are located in Toronto so prices in CAD after discounts and taxes (13% in Ontario) are:

1) Bambino Plus + Encore ESP (no additional employee discount): CAD 834 (~USD 600)
2) Express Impress: CAD 839 (~USD 605)
3) Touch: CAD 1194 (~USD 860)
4) Touch Impress (no additional employee discount): CAD 1989 (~USD 1434)

Ideally, the machine could assist tamp (we want to reduce variables and messes on the counter) and auto froth milk, which makes the Touch Impress very attractive. But I have read many reviews on the Touch Impress’s issues with reliability and inconsistency with the tamp. It is also the only one on our shortlist with no additional employee discount, and so the price difference between Touch and Touch Impress is hard to justify. 

I like the look of the Express Impress but also feel that auto milk frothing is more important than assisted tamp, esp. if I could just use a filter with the Touch and reduce mess. The Touch might also be great if we want to try other milk based drinks for ourselves and guests. The Touch’s touch screen seems laggy though, but overall has strong reviews. Option 1 and Option 2 are basically the same price, but more manual in their own ways. 

What do you think? Anything else we are not considering for first timer? Any feedback or recommendations? Appreciate your input!",1,1757527998.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1ndlkxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1ndlkxa/if_your_a_snobbish_person/,If your a snobbish person,"Congratulations. Your a asshole like all the other assholes you most likely surround yourself with. Being a snobbish doesn't mean anything other than:

Snob: a person who respects and likes only people who are of a high social class, and/or a person who has extremely high standards who is not satisfied by the things that ordinary people like: ""He's a terrible snob - if you haven't been to the right school he probably won't even speak to you.""
a person who believes that their tastes in a particular area are superior to those of other people.

See. Even the dictionary definition of you basically translates to 'a dick who thinks they're better than others they personally dont like/don't agree with. Why be proud of that?

What i dont like about snobbish assholes is the fact that you treat people below you like shit even though, you have no reason to. The only difference between a rich person and a poor person is the type of grocery store we go to, the brands we wear, and the area we live in. But a rich person can have the same skin as a poor person. A rich person has the same genetic makeup as a poor person. A rich person wears clothes just like a poor person. And a rich person can work just like a poor person.

There are rich blue collar workers who are able to buy big ass houses just like a lawyer or a doctor can. The difference is just the type of job and the earnings. Maybe a lawyer only had to work a year for a house while a oil rig worker had to work 20 years for his house. But at the bare bones of it, both people still were able to buy a house.

A poor person can still have the same fashion taste as a rich person. The difference? A poor person may have had to pull a few extra shifts to afford a fancy dress, while a rich person probably could've been able to see the dress on a whim and get it the same day. At the end of it, both people bought a fancy dress.

A poor person can cook just as good as a rich person. Difference? Rich person may have been able to spend all day practicing in their kitchen while a poor person can only practice as they're making dinner and has to eat the mistake rather than chucking it in the compost/trash. But both people are still practicing to cook.

None of us are better than others. You are not better than someone who can only afford those Starbucks coffees that come in little glass bottles at the gas station while you are fortunate enough to actually go to a coffee shop for a fancy coffee. 
And I think being a snob is just such a ***pathetic*** way to live. Because none of you acknowledge the countless of people who struggle to put food on the table. None of you even stop to realize that, that shitty beige house you live in, wouldn't even exist if you didn't pay for blue collared workers to bust their ass building it for you. And lots of rich people often cry ""well its only okay for you to bully me because I was rich. If I was poor you couldn't bully me"". We're not 'bullying you cause your rich'. We're treating you with the same disdain you look at homeless people with when they dare ask for change.

And while we're on the topic of homeless people. Why do you snobs always assume they're going to buy drugs or useless shit with their money you give them? If you dont want us assuming every snob is a asshole, how about you dont assume every homeless person is homeless because of drugs or alcohol. Do you know how fucking hard it is for even the poorest of renters to keep up with the financial strain of life? Cause even if you live in a trailer park, you still have to buy:

Food every month otherwise you die from starvation. And if you have kids? DHS will take them if you can't afford to feed those kids.

Clothes for everyone in the house. And that's not even talking about expensive clothes. You can be a regular at Goodwill and depending on how big a family you have, clothes can still cost more than you wish they did.

Bills. You have electric, water, gas, other utilities, rent for the house, if you had to go to the hospital- or gods forbid you have a disability/chronic illness of any kind then that shit costs ***THOUSANDS*** ALL TOGETHER. And you HAVE to pay it otherwise you dont have a fucking house anymore. (Or bad credit if you dont pay medical bills).

Nobody is poor because they want to. Nobody is homeless because they want to. Theyre in that situation because we ***ALL*** live in a capitalist hell. But you can choose to be a snob. And maybe you can't *really* choose if your rich, but you sure as shit can choose how you use that money. So choose the better option and *help* people. Don't shit on them when they're already buried in the mud of life.",1,1757527347.0,rant,0,0.67,False
1ndlktu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1ndlktu/station_epsilon_fallen/,Station Epsilon: Fallen,"The hum of Station Epsilon was steady, almost hypnotic. Crew members floated through the corridors, chatting lazily, checking instruments, enjoying the quiet of orbit. Light filtered through the observation domes, painting dusty cosmic trails across gleaming metal floors. Somewhere in the hydroponics bay, soft music played, a human attempt to make space feel like home.

Lieutenant Mara Vasquez leaned against a console, sipping recycled coffee. “Another peaceful day,” she murmured.

“Too peaceful,” Engineer Cho said, eyes scanning the monitors. “Feels… off.”

The first breach was subtle. A door cycled open in the engineering bay—not from internal commands. Mara froze. The airlock hissed, and the temperature dipped.

Then they appeared. At first, they were almost human, gliding into the bay, faces serene, eyes bright… but too wide, too still. The illusion shattered instantly. Skin tore like wet parchment, revealing a pulsing, coiled mess of sinew, tendrils, and sharpened bones beneath.

One raised an arm, bending it backward at an impossible angle. Tendrils unfurled like vipers, dripping black slime that sizzled where it touched metal. Mouths appeared along the limbs—rows of jagged teeth gnashing independently, gurgling a chorus of distorted voices, whispering:
“We… are… the end… we consume… your flesh…”

Cho screamed. Mara’s AR-15 was up in a flash. “Brace yourselves!”

The first bullets tore through one of the Voidwraiths. Its body exploded in wet, rubbery shreds—slime, sinew, and chitin spraying across the bay—but the pieces writhed independently, limbs crawling back together, reforming into a new horror.

Another twisted its human-like face, eyes stretching unnaturally, mouth splitting down both sides, revealing jagged teeth lined in gleaming, oily black ridges. Tentacles sprouted from every joint, flailing outward, smashing consoles and hurling floating tools like deadly projectiles.

“Bleed… we hunger… your screams fuel us…”

Mara’s squad fired into the writhing mass, muzzle flashes illuminating the grotesque forms. Each Voidwraith moved with liquid grace, bodies folding and stretching, flesh bubbling and melting into new, horrific shapes. One leaped into the air, body spinning like a corkscrew, landing on a bulkhead with a shattering crunch, splattering black ichor everywhere.

“Keep moving! Don’t let them surround the bay!” Mara shouted.

A Voidwraith’s face nearly touched hers, lips curling back, revealing multiple rows of teeth in a mouth that seemed to extend beyond its skull, gurgling inhumanly:
“We… take… your lives… we are eternal… you are meat…”

Cho vomited into a bulkhead, eyes wide. “They… they’re… everywhere…”

They were. The breach multiplied. Corridors were alive with writhing, slavering flesh, bodies splitting and reforming endlessly. Limbs bent backward, faces melted and reshaped, slime dripping and pooling like black water on the floor. Every shot Mara fired tore through something grotesque, but every kill was temporary. The Voidwraiths were horrifyingly clever, endless, and relentless.

Mara’s heart pounded. “We hold here, or we die here.”

The station lights flickered. The soft cosmic glow of peace was gone, replaced by a storm of teeth, tendrils, and the chorus of hundreds of voices screaming in unison, chanting:
“You… die… we… consume… we are… the end…”

The AR-15s barked. Limbs exploded. Flesh crawled. And through it all, Mara’s squad fought, bloodied, terrified, and utterly human against an inhuman, impossible enemy.",1,1757527341.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

1ndldfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LudwigAhgren/comments/1ndldfd/a_case_for_tip_to_tip_vietnam/,A case for Tip to Tip Vietnam 🇻🇳,"I know Lud was excited about Tip to Tip China in the last stream, but I think it’s going to be logistically too tough to arrange once he looks into it. 

The visa situation could be tricky, I’m pretty sure you need special filming permits and shit I think if you’re bringing a film/editing crew like he would need to. And some areas might not be easily accessible.

So, if that idea falls through, I’d like to put a case forward for Tip to Tip Vietnam🇻🇳 

I lived there for 18 months so I could be bias, but it’s got a lot of potential for sure. 

I think it strikes a great balance between being accessible enough to make it doable and challenging enough to be a significant step up from Japan.

Here’s my case for it in case Lud ever reads this (Warning: Huge essay incoming)

- Like Japanese, the Vietnamese language is difficult. I found it fucking impossible to learn, actually, compared to Japanese, which was much easier. Why? Vietnamese is a tonal language and there’s lots of difficult sounds for native English speakers. However, most Vietnamese people speak little to no English, especially outside of the big cities, so they’ll need a little bit to get by, which adds to the challenge.

- The challenge would be a significantly level up compared Japan as Vietnam is still very much a developing country. Its roads are wild, there’s frequent flooding, Infrastructure is generally just poorer so they’ll find it tough compared to Japan’s lovely paved clean roads and neat highways. There will be much more interesting exotic and challenging terrain to cover, but it’s still easily doable. 

- Vietnam’s motorbike culture goes crazy. Everyone rides. In the big cities (Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh), every road is crammed with motorbikes and they all drive batshit crazy, which will make for great content. I’d love to see Lud and Michael getting culture shock as they go elbow to elbow with Vietnamese bikers. The rule I learned riding there is “Don’t worry about what’s behind you, just don’t hit anyone in front”. They take this literally - nobody signals and a lot of people straight up rip their wing mirrors off because they don’t use them. There’s pretty much no rules other than don’t crash. This adds to the danger and will guarantee plenty of funny moments.

- The Vietnamese people are friendly, funny, and helpful so lots of awesome interactions are guaranteed. They also love interacting with tourists, especially in the more remote towns where white people are still a novelty.

- The scenery is awesome and varied. There’s tons of cool places to see and things to do along the way. Also some really awesome roads for bikers like the Hai Van Pass - Google it.

- Big conbini culture in Vietnam. The boys relied heavily on 7/11 to get by in Japan (for food and directions) - there’s tons of these and similar conbini brands everywhere in Vietnam.

- It’s common for white folk to get “shaken down” by the cops in Vietnam for “beer money”. This happens whether you’re riding legally or not. They stop you, ask for a 200k VND bribe (about $7 USD), then cheerfully send you on your way. This sounds stressful but it’s really NBD and will make for great content and interesting interactions for sure.

- Vietnam is a little smaller than Japan, but it’s in a similar ballpark. I think Japan is like 1.5x the length tip to tip, but like I say, Vietnam will be more challenging to traverse nonetheless. It’s got a similar kind of ‘long shape’ too geographically speaking, if you know what I mean, so it kind of makes sense for a tip to tip series.

- It’s a communist country with a culture and norms that are very alien to most westerners and it’s somewhere most people don’t know much about. Lud liked this aspect of China so he’ll get the same thing from Vietnam - the two are very similar in many respects. 

- Lud talks about how the fact the US is in a Cold War with China makes it more interesting. Of course, the US also had a very real war with Vietnam in not too distant history. I think an American travelling through in that context makes it more interesting - he’ll find the Vietnamese truly hold no grudges and are super welcoming and hospitable.

- The Vietnam war also makes ‘tip to tip’ more contextually interesting as historically, the northern tip of Vietnam was the communist stronghold and the southern tip was the capitalist/democratic stronghold. You can still “feel” this today as you travel through - the people, culture, and even architecture in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh are very different.

- Other aspects that will add to the challenge and make for interesting dynamics and content include dodging scammers (there are many) navigating the Mekong (they could follow a route along it), coping with the insane heat/humidity, visiting night markets, eating delicious/exotic Vietnamese dishes/delicacies (egg coffee is a must try) and so on.

- It’ll be super easy logistically to arrange. Vietnam is a common backpacker route and easily accessible to tourists and remote workers - they’ll have no trouble getting visas and arranging everything.

- it’s super cheap too, so Lud won’t have to break the bank arranging it. For example, you can find good enough hotels everywhere for under $20 a night and food is dirt cheap, so it won’t cost him a ton to pay for his crew’s daily living costs.

If I had the time, I could list more reasons why Vietnam would be awesome but I’ll stop there.

(2) Will we have all police meetings in the pub or can we sometimes meet at the station? Need to know because my partner is close to the pub and I have to stand around looking at them guiltily whenever they're close.

1ndlcm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ndlcm7/am_i_overreacting_for_flipping_out_at_the_hospital/,Am I overreacting for flipping out at the hospital,"
Background: my girlfriend has a one year old grandson. Since he was born he’s been coming here twice a week. At first I was apprehensive because I’ve not been around many children, but I fell in love with the little guy. He’s my best tiny friend. 

I have a huge fear of choking. I knew a 2 year old who choked to death. I’m very vigilant about what he eats or what’s lying around the house. I’m calm about everything relating to him except choking. 

His 17 year old mother was kicked out of her house so she’s staying with us. The first morning she’s here, my girlfriend goes to work, I’m off work relaxing downstairs on the couch, she comes running down stairs franticly: “he’s choking, he’s choking!”. I feel the blood leave my body, jump up and run over to him. His face and lips were white but he was breathing and looking at me, kind of delirious. I asked her what she means. 

“I don’t know he was throwing up and choking.”

I ask a million questions but she’s extremely panicky. I’m thinking “maybe there’s something partially lodged in his throat?” I have no idea what’s happening but he doesn’t look good so we drive to the ER. The entire ride she’s in the back with him “keep your eyes open, oh my god oh my god.”

He was breathing but acting weird. I still have no clue what’s happening and she’s too panicked to articulate. I’m thinking every second counts just get him to the hospital. 

We arrive, I jump out, grab him, hand him to her, watch her run inside and start talking to the front desk. I’m slightly relieved because they’ll take care of him now. He’s safe, he’s at the hospital.

I park the car and go inside and see the mother sitting with the boy on her lap. I run over:

“Did anyone look at him? What’s going on?”

She shakes her head no with tears in her eyes and now, in the hospital lighting, I see how white his face and lips really are. His eyes are rolling in the back of his head, then he snaps out of it, then it happens again.

I realize she’s 17 and was probably very coy about how she approached the window. 

I run to the front desk and I asked, with urgency:

“Hey, do you know how much longer because I think he’s chok…”

Without looking up, the woman at the desk:

“I don’t know I just got here.”

I realize now that she’s switching shifts with a co-worker.

“Ok, but I think he’s choking, his breathing is weird and he’s turning white” (Pointing for her to look at the baby)

Her(still not looking up): “I just got here, you’ll go back when it’s your turn like everyone else.”

“Yeah, but I think he’s CHOKING, his lips are white, I think it’s an emergency.”

Her(finally looking at me): “Sir, everyone’s here for an emergency.”

I’m not sure what’s happening to this little boy. I’m thinking he’s in immediate danger and every second counts. I’m thinking he’s choking or kind of choking or something is blocking his airway. I don’t know what’s happening because I’m not a doctor which is why I’m at the hospital. I wasn’t looking to cut in line (only one other person was there). I didn’t think “oh, MY baby has a tummy ache and he needs to be seen NOW!” I wasn’t looking for special treatment. I was terrified this kid was going to die and I was being treated like I was at Starbucks complaining I got the wrong coffee. So I lost it. I didn’t curse, but I did yell and make a scene. I don’t remember everything I said but it was stuff like:

“why the hell are you giving me attitude?! This kid might be choking to death!? This is a hospital, right! I just want someone to look at him! What’s wrong with you guys?!” With lots of arm waving and pacing back and forth, face turning red with anger. 

A security guard saw how panicked I was and he said “ I got you,” ran and got a nurse who came out very calmly and looked him over. Checked his breathing. Checked his pulse. She surmised he was not in immediate danger and she was very nice and understanding. 

Did I over react for how I spoke? Was I a male Karen? I know she probably has the line “everyone’s here for an emergency” locked and loaded for people who complain about the wait time and I know she just arrived to work, but I don’t think the way she acted was warranted, especially working in the emergency room of a hospital. But maybe I’m wrong and I should have just sat there and waited my turn",2,1757526845.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

Other Clubs to Join,"When I was an undergrad, getting rejected from consulting clubs was devastating… **up until I joined other clubs and found people and friends I wouldn’t trade the world for.**

So here’s a list of some of those clubs that are still open! I know another list was posted, but want to add on some of my favorites too 🙂

**Social:**

Asian American Association: Cultural club with a heavy social tilt. Was personally in this one and while the culture may not be for everyone, it was amazing for me and I would highly recommend at least trying it out.

International Students at Berkeley: Don’t even have to be international, but maybe a better niche if you are. Throw a variety of social events.

Other cultural orgs: Don’t know as much about other orgs (Indian Student Association, etc), but worth a try.

Coffee Club: Fun way to see new cafes and explore the area with people equally as interested in coffee. 

**Social/Volunteering:**

Alpha Phi Omega: Friends who pledged said it was amazing. Non-hazing service org with a good balance of social events and volunteering. Members are really really close.

The Berkeley Project: Organize The Berkeley Project volunteering day every semester. Good mix of committees for professional experience plus a good way to meet people.

Habitat for Humanity: Huge organization to my knowledge, but maybe not as much of a social lean.

**Fashion:**

Fast Magazine: Honestly don’t know as much about this but heard great things. 

Bare Magazine: Also don’t know as much about this but friends had a good time.

**Misc:**

Poker@Berkeley: Actually a really good way to meet people since you’re sitting down for games with them for potentially hours at a time. Just don’t get addicted to Poker 💀.

Berkeley Forum: Heard really good things and also offers a more robust professional experience. Club is oriented around hosting speakers on campus.

I have been on a journey learning from this thread so thank you all for all the knowledge shared/frustrations documented. I am finding a great deal of variability morning to afternoon in the extraction of espresso in my BBE. Yesterday’s lunchtime extraction was too quick, 18g dose / 36 out in about 22/23 seconds, I then dialed it in to be 36g over 30 seconds. This morning when I pulled it was less than 10gs over the same amount of time.

I’m using Parlor Coffee’s Wallabout blend, roasted August 26th here in Brooklyn, prep is the same each time (WDT) on a Normcore Cosmos 18g basket. Gemini suggests that the reasonable swing in temperature and humidity from yesterday \~1pm to this morning is responsible which I could take at face value if the difference wasn’t so dramatic.

I do turn the machine on for 10-15 minimum prior to pulling a shot, and I always have a single shot run through the head to finish warming everything up prior to pulling a double espresso. I also performed the OPV mod over the weekend to bring the pressure down as my machine is an older one, and have adjusted the burr to be able to achieve a finer grind.

I appreciate the BBEs can have their own quirks given it is an all-in-one, but any advice is appreciated (even if it is that Gemini is right and I should consult my local meteorologist in the morning prior to prepping my espresso ✌️).

My MIL texted me one Friday morning asking how I was feeling, what we were up to that weekend, etc - completely normal and nice. 

I told her we (my husband and I) were going to meet some friends for coffee Friday morning before my husband logs on for work (he works remotely), then continued telling her about the rest of our weekend plans. The texting continued back and forth like normal. 

Hours later, she texted me again and said, “I’ve been thinking about it and you can’t have coffee!! You’ve never been pregnant so you probably didn’t know that! Coffee isn’t recommended and you shouldn’t be drinking it.” 

I do love my MIL, but I was instantly annoyed. Of course, my mind jumped to: “Does she not trust me to take care of my body/baby during this pregnancy? Does she think I haven’t looked up the guidelines?” 

I don’t know what guidelines said back when she was pregnant in the 80s (genuinely, I don’t know), so it’s possible coffee wasn’t recommended at all back then — but times have changed. 

I texted her back a while later and told her that US guidelines state 200mg of caffeine or less per day are okay, and that Canadian guidelines say 300mg or less (I don’t know why they differ, but I’m following US guidelines). I told her most days I drink 1 cup of decaf coffee and I usually don’t even finish it, but there are days when I’ll have a Medium roast coffee or something — a coffee that falls below that 200mg limit. I made it clear that I’m not giving up coffee, but I am monitoring my intake. 

I was nice, but to the point. She didn’t text me back. 

I was a little hurt, but wanted to believe she legitimately didn’t know and that she was looking out for me. She could have, you know, looked it up herself before she sent me such an out of the blue text, but she didn’t and I can’t change that. 

It was one of those “I’m annoyed in the moment, but I’m okay now” type things. My husband has been GREAT through my pregnancy telling me if his mom ever oversteps or if I’m ever frustrated by something she says or does, I should let him know immediately and he’ll take care of it.

Would love some input from this sub. 

My husband and I both like milk based drinks. Most days we order flat white with a medium roast and lactose free milk. We have a k-cup machine but it just tastes nasty. So we often just go to our local cafes to pay for our flat whites. Cost is definitely adding up. 

We are now looking for an espresso machine that both of us can use at home, and we can get the beans locally. We are “ok” willing to do some manual work, but it’s not always possible with two kids at home. So I think most of the time we would just want to press a few buttons and get it done. Been looking at the semi-auto machines due to the fact that we want flexibility and quality coffee. And my husband would want to spend less time fiddling with settings while I’m more of a nerd. 

I’ve narrowed it down to a few options. They are all 20% off right now with the Breville sales, but we also have additional employee discounts on a few of these which is great, but it also makes the decision harder. We are located in Toronto so prices in CAD after discounts and taxes (13% in Ontario) are:

1) Bambino Plus + Encore ESP (no additional employee discount): CAD 834 (~USD 600)
2) Express Impress: CAD 839 (~USD 605)
3) Touch: CAD 1194 (~USD 860)
4) Touch Impress (no additional employee discount): CAD 1989 (~USD 1434)

Ideally, the machine could assist tamp (we want to reduce variables and messes on the counter) and auto froth milk, which makes the Touch Impress very attractive. But I have read many reviews on the Touch Impress’s issues with reliability and inconsistency with the tamp. It is also the only one on our shortlist with no additional employee discount, and so the price difference between Touch and Touch Impress is hard to justify. 

I like the look of the Express Impress but also feel that auto milk frothing is more important than assisted tamp, esp. if I could just use a filter with the Touch and reduce mess. The Touch might also be great if we want to try other milk based drinks for ourselves and guests. The Touch’s touch screen seems laggy though, but overall has strong reviews. Option 1 and Option 2 are basically the same price, but more manual in their own ways.

Only 3 meals a day, no snacks, drink only coffee, lemon water & the occasional whiskey soda (no mixers). Switched to only berries last month as fruit, and only for lunch, giving me time to burn it off.

Was really hoping for a number lower than 5.7. Have I gone as low as I can go or does another 3 months on this program have a chance for further significant improvement? I was under the impression that after 3 months all the extra glucose should have cycled its way out.

Finally, no craving for nicotine at all. When I saw an ad or a scene in a movie, I just made a gagging sound and pushed that thought of “I need it” far away. Screw it. That damn legal drug ruined the last 3 years of my life. It’s a disgusting habit and I’m free from it now.

But quitting alcohol really hit me  or rather, now I understand why those first 40 days were so hard. Sadly, I was abusing it a lot: 4 nights a week I was drinking, often alone.

Dropping both at once was tough, but now, after just 60 days, I actually feel better. Now it’s time to sort out my health issues. But hey anxiety and depression that came with quitting are finally gone. I can even drink coffee again without shaking like a leaf in the wind. Woohoo!

In my previous post I wrote that I wanted to do a dopamine detox and I did it. For 10 days, I had 2 screen-free hours every day. I either read books (I was into thrillers and mystical stuff), or did chores. It had such a positive effect that I’ll definitely keep going.

No, seriously—have you seen the swarm of links promising easy money just for dodging some robots and squiggly words? Like, what?! Why isn’t everyone on a yacht if it’s that easy?

So, out of pure curiosity (and a touch of shame), I actually clicked on one. You guys, **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** keeps popping up, looking all innocent and whispering sweet nothings about “fast cash.” But is it real? Let’s break it down together because I am straight-up shocked.

- **You log on and the interface is smooth…almost too smooth?**
- Suddenly, they’re throwing Captchas at your face like dodgeballs in gym class. Snap, snap—You solve a few, and your “earnings” climb!
- BUT WAIT! They want you to hit a “payout goal.” Like, you HAVE to reach this number in-app before you can withdraw. Hmmm.
- And then BOOM: “Sorry, you need to test another app at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** to receive your cash.” Déjà vu?

Can someone please explain why every time I make it halfway to “cashing out,” there’s a new puzzle or a test or sometimes a survey—sometimes on a different app altogether, but always ending at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**? Is this the Siberian hamster wheel of side hustles?

Now, here’s the mind-boggle—

- Who’s paying us for, like…proving we aren’t robots?
- Why do all roads lead to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**? Is it actually changing my bank account (or changing my stress levels)?
- Is every new gateway just another checkpoint on the way to nowhere, or have YOU—yes, YOU—actually gotten paid (or scammed) from this?

For real, I’m hyped and confused. This whole app maze is both exhilarating (oooh, “free” money?) and frustrating (HELLO WALLET, WHERE ARE YOU??).

Some things to think about:
- If cash was truly this easy, wouldn’t everyone know?
- Why do none of the success stories ever show receipts?
- Is **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** the golden ticket…or just a redirect to the next click trap?
- Why am I suddenly obsessed with clicking pictures of traffic lights and motorbikes? Did I lose a giant chunk of my adulthood to this already??

Share your experiences, receipts, rants, or awakenings. Has anyone here actually made a cent, or are we talking unicorn money again?

1ndkn4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/1ndkn4h/bf_and_i_seemingly_having_initial_obs_at_the/,"BF and I seemingly having initial OBs at the exact same time, but in different areas","I don’t know how to begin except to say that I’m extremely overwhelmed. I (35f) went to the DR for what I thought was rough sex coupled with a yeast infection. I’m still waiting on results of a swab test, but the nurse is pretty positive it’s herpes. Still don’t know if it’s type 1 or 2. 

This is where it gets unusual. My Bf (45m) and I had just returned from a trip in the sun. We both felt broken but for different reasons. I thought my vagina was sore from too much/rough sex or a yeast infection from wet bikinis. He got a really bad sunburn, especially on his neck. On the plane ride home, we both felt feverish. The next day, he had a worsening sore throat and fever symptoms and my vulva was so swollen I was in excruciating pain, I could barely walk and I screamed when I had to pee. It didn’t get better so after a couple days I went to the DR and was shocked to hear it was probably herpes. I immediately told him and he checked his mouth and he had sores. After closer examination, I have about 10-15 little red bumps on my vulva. He went to the DR the next day. We are both waiting on confirmation but all signs point to HSV.

I’m spiraling trying to figure out how it happened. We both have only been sleeping with each other for a few months now. (I honestly believe him, but i guess nothing is 100%). I suppose it could’ve been dormant in one of us, but that seems unlikely since we’re experiencing it at the same time, right? Also since he’s experiencing oral symptoms, is it most probable he contracted type 1 and he gave it to me through oral sex?

I’m struggling with what this means for my future. I’m coming to terms with the fact that my sex live won’t ever be the same. I’m finding a little solace in the fact that we both have it but am still a little unclear on the mechanics of it being in different areas. Can we still have unprotected penetrative and or oral sex? Kissing? Neither of us have any symptoms of it being in the other area. I also have only been dating this guy for 5 months so the thought of disclosing to possible future partners is terrifying and something that I’m not even ready to think about.

I’m the type of person that researches things to death in order to feel some type of control. I’m a strict vegetarian and have been my whole life, so this whole arginine/lysine thing is scaring me. I absolutely love nuts and coffee. In fact I was eating peanuts when I found out they were not recommended. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I did pick up some lysine supplements to try to combat that but I don’t want to change my diet. I usually eat very healthy, unprocessed foods and indulge occasionally at nice restaurants. Do any vegans/vegetarians have any experiences they can share?

I also work out pretty hard daily, mostly outdoors. From what I’ve read here that triggers OBs for a lot of ppl? Does anyone have any tips to prevent that?

Lastly, I’m finding a little hope because although my OB was debilitating for about 3 days, it seems more mild than what many have to go through. By the 4th day I was feeling much better. I’m taking acyclovir and lysine. The bumps seem small, there’s only 1 maybe 2 that look like they’re scabbing. The others don’t really look like there is anything to scab. Is there any sort of correlation between the severity of the first OB and the frequency/severity of future ones?

I know this is a lot, and I’m feeling really alone and trying to reconcile my feeling of the stigma with the reality that this is a minor (?) skin condition. I know I won’t have all the answers, but any advice, experiences, thoughts, or tips would be helpful. Thank you 🙏 ",1,1757525300.0,Herpes,6,1.0,False

1ndkmau,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITH/comments/1ndkmau/aith_for_moving_out/,AITH for moving out?,"I've been married 4, cohabitating 6, in relationship 7 with my husband.  We're in 40s he's a few years older.

I hit a wall recently and moved out since I felt my needs weren't getting addressed.  The biggest things were:

1. he has not held steady employment since the pandemic.  He quit his job expecting to take a month off and then look but then that totally got derailed.  He had worked FT since he was 18, hit burnout, needed a break.  He started doing food delivery upon seeing me do it (my jobs are all 1099 and they took a major hit for \~2 yrs) but then stopped that after a year.  He's had several jobs since but all of them he quit suddenly with no plan after, not working for months.  Currently it's been almost 2 yrs.  We are ok financially (paid off house and not massively high COL) but I am trying to make up for $200k of student loans and literally $0 retirement savings which is where I was at when we first met (didn't make over $20k until then and I do well but not crazy now).  My day job (I do multiple things) is incredibly stressful.  I've been trying to get a new job for years but there are VERY few in my area, I have literally applied to all 11 openings since I moved here 8 yrs ago, been offered them, worked some, quit some (none of them are FT, and everything is 1099/commission based).  This job is the best of the bunch, I'm close to FT but also with as much flexibility as I could imagine for a side job/passion I have, plus vacation when I get get away with it, and I'm stuck unless I start my own biz, which I'm hesitant to take the risk on right now.  My husband offered to use money from his brokerage btw to help but he really doesn't have that much and it's his only retirement savings.  He said I'm controlling for not letting him use it but literally it's terrible to pull from that, even two financial advisors I got us to meet with (I thought hearing it from a neutral voice might help) said the same thing.
2. I don't feel at home.  He is very resistant to change having lived alone in the house for 15+ yrs before I moved in and has basically never had roommates (I've lived in many situations with roommates and not and never felt like this before).  I'm not asking for major stuff but it's almost without fail been a no with all these reasons why not, or after in some cases months to years of asking for a thing (all of which I am paying for btw) there will be some diminished version of it with a lot of complaining/criticism.  At first I felt grateful to be in his home but then I realized my cost of living skyrocketed between the commute and utils, let alone when I had to take all his expenses over, it's a place I would not want to live tho I tried my best to adapt since he owned the house and would never live in the city I was in, and would have been better with if he let me make it my home too, and my health has suffered (I used to walk/bike/public transit everywhere, can't here) and that it's not superficial to want a ""homey"" home, especially with the man who is my spouse.  He admits he is SLOOOOOW to change but I really hit a wall recently.  I also get really on edge from the constant alarms he has going all day (home alarm each time we enter, wake up, various reminders, laundry, microwave, oven, etc).  He cut it back a little but it's still all the time, and I have CPTSD so it doesn't exactly help.
3. Due to his mostly untreated depression he has cancelled multiple vacations we plan and I had prepaid parts of this year.  He takes meds, doesn't believe in therapy.  Had other self care things he had been doing for decades when we met but then stopped in the pandemic and hasn't really gotten a routine on since.  He often has low physical energy and/or occasional pain. I have expressed that it's hard for me to take off work and that when he cancelled them it really made me feel not valued, frustrated and even angry.  This is on top of always having to adapt to his needs (one trip I booked 3 nights in a luxury resort that I thought he could tolerate- I always want to go to beach but he almost always says no- then said we can go wherever you want for the other 5 days.  He kept delaying then finally said I don't want to go to the 3 night place so I'm not going with you at all).  He also started self medicating more with weed (I have no issue with that personally but how it affects him is wild) and alcohol.  He had never used weed when we first got together but he's been self-medicating with severe withdrawal symptoms each time he tries to quit for 3 yrs now, and alcohol he had told me that he was a recovered functional alcoholic, he only drank rarely the first year+ but then the pandemic happened and we all were coping I guess.

After a shorter trip this summer he cancelled, then got into arguments with me at a restaurant about that weekend (I said there is no way I took off and going to sit in our house all weekend) I said he needed to meet some needs I had, I said I wanted to see some very reasonable efforts over the next 6 weeks: arrange dinner 2x/week (even if takeout.  just get it off my plate of mental load, which is often how him trying to cook ends up, even though I know he did try), certain # of job apps a week, weekly couple's counseling (we had gone intermittently before and our therapist had suggested weekly since the beginning), and ANY type of regular income- PT, FT, gig work, whatever by the end of the 6 weeks.  Well he didn't meet this, and then got in a fight with me again in public about the upcoming vacation I had paid for, then asked for me not to go with him, he thought it was better we cool down.

I was livid and then decided to move out since I felt I wasn't getting through to him despite me asking nicely many times, trying to help, encouraging him to get self care and therapy, having many meltdowns, and just felt I couldn't take it anymore (btw I am also under incredible family and work stress so that isn't helping).  I needed to get my health back on track (I've gained 50 lbs since I moved in with him due to lack of built-in exercise, eating/drinking stress coping, and hormonal changes) and I knew living in the city would do that.

He has taken everything really calmly, almost robotic which kind of worries me.  He told me when he got back (I had moved while he was gone) that he got called for his dream job interview (something I told him to try, he was nervous to) and didn't tell me since he wanted to tell me in person.  They would be idiots not to hire him and it's a place we both could seem him working long term.  He also said part of the trip for him was to really kick weed, it's been over a month now which is the longest since he started using.  We met only one more time since I moved out and he said he changed all passwords to anything I had access to, got replacement of all his credit cards, wanted his keys back and we needed to have a short meeting so he could stay calm for his interview.  I got that but I also was annoyed that once again my needs were put second and felt hurt that his first instinct was about distrust (he's had other issues around not trusting me with money, which there is no reason to support from my actions, tho his cousin really got fk'd in a divorce which is why he feels that way).

He has insisted through this whole process that he loves me no matter what, and will always be my friend no matter what ""I"" (not him?) decide, and that we will get through this.  We've scheduled a date for this weekend- some volunteering/outdoors activity and then a local place we like.  He's since had the interview and said it was intimidating in front of a panel but he thinks he did great.  In general he is actually a really loving man- he will do things like give me a massage, make a card or get flowers, do little creative clever things for me, etc.  When not in a down spiral he is goofy/sweet, great with kids (we don't have nor want btw), passionate about society (upon my encouragement he recently joined an activist group and is finally making new friends for the first time in adult life).

I feel bad bc I understand he has mental health issues and he is working on it in his super sloth way.  But I love my new place, it looked more on day 1 like ""my"" place than his ever did.  It has a fireplace, an incredible deck with space for garden (since childhood I have been obesessed with gardens but often due to living situation couldn't.  when I could, I did) seed starting and storage cabinet for my fruit trees (my trees died due to my husband not letting me store in garage), it's affordable, safe (his neighborhood has had a slew of breakins this year and someone saw someone try to break into my car, they keyed it), quiet, walkable to nice parks, coffee shops, grocery, work.  I can get city bikes nearby, the gym is a block from work (I didn't sign up before since I felt a rush to get home before he ""logged off"" for the night, there was this whole thing).  I just love it.

1ndkl9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1ndkl9b/assess_rocco_and_roxie_upholstery_cleaner_for_pet/,Assess Rocco and Roxie Upholstery Cleaner for Pet Stains Effectively,"Testing products is something I often do in my day-to-day routine, and coming across products like the Rocco & Roxie 865520000066 has genuinely been an intriguing experience. As someone who deals with inevitable spills, pet messes, and random stains daily (thank you clumsy pets and equally messy humans), I was keen to understand whether this oxygen-powered stain remover lives up to its claims. Spoiler alert: it’s sort of a mixed bag, but let’s break it down systematically.

**Product Design and Packaging**  
To kick things off, the design and packaging are practical yet nothing groundbreaking. The bottle is pretty standard in terms of size and shape, measuring roughly 10 inches high and 2 inches wide, making it relatively easy to handle and store. At two pounds, it’s not overly heavy, which was a small relief during repeated use in scrubbing sessions. However, I noticed that the spray nozzle occasionally didn’t provide the smoothest spray; it sometimes felt uneven, which can be annoying mid-clean. Beyond that, the color scheme and labeling scream practicality over aesthetics, and while it’s no showstopper, it does get the job done functionally.

**Ease of Use and Application**  
Using this product was straightforward, which is always a plus for me. Following the instructions on the bottle, I sprayed the stain directly, let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then dabbed or scrubbed. Simple, right? Well, mostly. On smaller stains, the product worked like magic—literally fading them away, especially with coffee and juice spots on my couch cushions. For more set-in stains, such as an ink disaster on my favorite armchair (don’t ask how that happened), it required multiple rounds of application to achieve decent results. I did appreciate the lack of overpowering, chemical-like odors, though. The cleaner has a mild, inoffensive scent, which didn’t leave my house smelling like a sterile hospital.

**Strengths**  
- Fast-acting formula works wonders on fresh stains like spilled wine, coffee, and juice.  
- Safe for use around pets and children, which is a massive relief for someone trying to stop my curious four-legged friend from licking every random surface.  
- Certified safe on all carpet types, so I didn’t feel nervous experimenting on my delicate Persian rug.  
- Multi-purpose and versatile: I’ve used it on a range of things, including carpets, upholstery, and a very suspicious stain on someone’s sweatshirt (they’ll remain unnamed).  

[Check Rocco & Roxie 865520000066 price on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b00wt7js1o/)  

**Performance Results**  
The oxygen-powered cleaning certainly lived up to its promise on many occasions. The product operates with activated oxygen technology, which apparently breaks up stains right at their molecular base. While this science-talk is impressive, what matters more is that I could visibly watch smaller stains disappear after a quick spray-and-scrub combo. Pet-related messes, from dirt to more, let’s say *organic* accidents, were mostly obliterated. However, tougher set-in stains like old blood marks took persistence. I ended up needing three separate sessions on a couch cushion, and even then, I wouldn’t say it restored the cushion to its original beauty. It’s effective but not miraculous.

**Safety and Environmental Friendliness**  
One of the product’s boasts, which I can vouch for, is its gentle yet effective formula. It’s chlorine-free and color-safe, which means I didn’t have to panic about discoloration whether I was using it on my beige carpet or a bright red quilt. Additionally, it’s non-aerosol, which made me feel marginally better from an environmental standpoint.

**Drawbacks**  
- Sometimes struggles with set-in stains, making persistence and reapplication necessary.  
- The spray nozzle occasionally sputters awkwardly and feels cheap given the price of the product.  
- It’s not the best fit for people hoping for a one-spray-fixes-all experience. Multi-application is practically a given for tougher spots.  

**Other Options**  
When comparing this to peer products like Resolve Pet Expert or the Bissell spot cleaners, I noticed distinct pros and cons. This particular cleaner shines in its safety aspects, especially around pets and kids, whereas I’ve found competing products to occasionally leave either noticeable residue or strong smells. However, the Bissell option, with its foam-based formula, might tackle tougher stains faster in some cases. Still, for those looking for an eco-friendlier and multi-purpose option, Rocco & Roxie stands out.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Evaluating the value for money of this cleaning spray has been one of the trickier parts of testing it. While it delivers excellent results on smaller and fresher stains, its performance on set-in or particularly stubborn ones doesn’t justify a hefty price tag in comparison to some other upholstery cleaners. I don’t mind investing a bit more for quality, but I expected consistency across different cleaning scenarios. On a positive note, the formula stretches well. A single bottle lasted me a fair while, even with frequent use.

I got engaged this year and my fiancee is an incredible woman. Blessed, really. We are planning a wedding (which can be a bit stressful) but she is doing a lot of that work to take it off of me. She is the love of my life and one of the few rays of happiness that I've got going for me. 

I work shift work (swing shifts) in a dangerous field and I was hospitalized in July of this year with my first panic attack while on the job. Thought I was dying, honestly. Heart racing, dizzy, blood pressure through the roof, couldn't catch my breath, fight or flight. And, while ive always been an anxious person, it seems like the grief and the exhaustion has finally caught up with me. I've been having panic attacks semi-frequently since Jy and they are usually always at work. Tightness in the chest, short of breath, feeling of doom, etc. Had multiple EKGs done as well as other blood tests. Heart is healthy. Purely mental. 

So, Dr. put me on 10mg of Paxil. Im on day 5 of taking it with a follow up in a month. I've had light, annoying headaches for two days and, while the panic attacks have gotten shorter and less severe, I really dont like how this medication is making me feel, if that makes sense. Again, maybe it is all mental, but I just feel off taking it. Foggy. Im nervous reading about all the withdrawals and side effects. 

I dont like medications and have never taken them for anything. I know you aren't supposed to quit Paxil cold turkey, but I really dont want to take this for another month just to tell the doctor in October that I dont want to take this anymore. I feel like the side effects of quitting after day 5 would be less than quitting after a month? 

I dont know. What are some more natural, homeopathic treatments yall have used for anxiety? I dont drink (sober over a year) or do drugs. Im in relatively good shape. I do smoke, but it is less than a pack a week. I dont do any other drugs. I have *maybe* one cup of coffee a day (though rarely before work because caffeine screws up my anxiety). 

Thanks for any and all feedback and help. ",1,1757525110.0,Anxiety,4,1.0,False
1ndki2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ndki2e/i_got_in_trouble_for_messing_up_on_something_i/,I got in trouble for messing up (on something I wasn’t trained on),"So I work at a very popular café chain in NYC. My location is right next to a college, so business is always busy. I started about a month and a half ago, but training has been horrible. They basically just have us complete some modules for each station then feed us to the sharks after that. Barely and hands on training, no direction, we just have to figure it out. As you could imagine, we have a terrible retention rate because of this. People are known to quit right away, no show, or “silent quit” by picking up the minimal number of shifts until they’re fired. 

Anyway, the two most complicated tasks at the restaurant are opening and closing. It’s common knowledge that there should always be a manager (or at least a shift leader) there to assist with opening up or closing the store, definitely not leaving trainees on their own. Well, unfortunately 3 out of 4 of our managers took vacation all at the same time, so they got really comfortable with letting us do things that we were not properly trained on. The other day, I had to close up the store with another trainee that was hired at the exact same time as me. Sadly, the café was wayyy busier at nighttime than usual, so our pre-closing got delayed. We finished an hour late, and my colleague messed up while counting the till so it displayed a negative number and the safe wouldn’t unlock. We had to call our manager at 11pm to help us figure out through FaceTime. Nonetheless, all the stress from the situation led us to neglect some tasks and producers that are essential to closing … some of which we weren’t even aware of. My manger pulled me aside, showed me the footage, and gave me a warning. I got my email from HR last night.

Also, no. There was no checklist given, no time stamps on when we should have certain things completed, we were just expected to get everything correct with the mediocre training that we were given. I don’t think it’s fair that we have this documented on our records when we simply weren’t trained on closing properly. Hell, there are people that I work with that still don’t even know how to make coffee !!! It’s ridiculous. We’re both on a three month probation before this can get wiped from our record.

Like most Americans, I cannot afford to lose my job. I don’t have my degree yet so options for anything higher are slim to none, and we all know how awful the job market is right now and I cannot risk the time it could take me to find something different. I was unemployed for three months before I landed this job, I refuse to go through the possibly never-ending searching again. So I’m just gonna suck it up, grit my teeth, and clock in.

I do have a meeting to voice my frustrations with the training, I just hope my concerns are taking seriously and there’s no retaliation. Wish me luck !",3,1757524996.0,jobs,1,1.0,False

1ndkhil,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/1ndkhil/cannot_believe_some_businesses_stoop_so_low/,Cannot believe some businesses stoop so low,"Hey everyone, I am the founder of Coffee and Cream, someone who loves coffee, and wishes to bring speciality to the forefront.

Since I love coffee, I generally go to all the new coffee places in the town that I hear about. So I recently came through this reel on some new place called Backstory Coffee. I went there, didn't like their coffee at all, told the serveur, and dropped a 1 star rating on Google. Not because I own a competing brand, but because I personally take feedbacks very seriously. Personally, feedbacks have helped me improve our brands so much. One time, we got a 1 star for leaks in our delivered cups, I discarded 1000s of cups, ordered new ones that's 3 times more expensive than the previous cups. And that's how I thought others too take feedbacks.

So the very next day, as soon as our outlet is live on Swiggy, I get **two** orders back to back. Nothing unusual about it, we got the orders prepared and packed. A few more orders rolled in, all delivered.

Around night we noticed someone (let's call him **person A**) dropped a comment on our page - saying worst coffee etc. etc. This was from the guy who placed the order as soon as the outlet opened. I politely responded assuming we might have missed something, and taking this as a genuine review, I offered him a fresh cup of coffee on the house as an effort to make sure we do it right.

Next day, early in the morning, I got a call from Swiggy customer care saying that person A has complaint.

We opened the Swiggy dashboard to realise that the other order that was received together with A's order was rated 1 star - with comment saying bad packaging, taste not good etc.

Since I take feedbacks seriously, we called him, let's call him **person B**, to understand what went wrong with his order. Before ending the call, he said - it is really nice that you listen to your customers. All good, we offered him some discount on his next order to set the tone right.

After some time, the person A now raised another complaint, asking for refund, dropped a 1 star rating. For the first time, we got 2 one stars in a single day.

Around evening, we got a comment, this time from B, on the exact same post - saying worst coffee etc etc. Then this person B, even went on to comment bomb another post posted by one of the influencers.

That's when I realised something's fishy. People don't stay upset over 1 cup of bad coffee (if at all it was bad) for days (*right?*). I realised exactly two days ago, I had given Backstory Coffee the negative review.

So I looked at their profiles. Backstory has only **312** followers, so if there are mutuals between these accounts, chances are they are here not for the coffee, but for tarnishing the image of the homegrown brand that I have been building slowly.

So I scrapped the username's of the followers of Backstory coffee, person A and person B. Wrote a python script to find matches.

So the mutuals were found. For person A, there were multiple mutuals, including one of his own brother. For person B, turns out he forgot to unfollow Backstory Coffee from his other account. Both of them, however, cleverly (or so they thought?) unfollowed Backstory from the accounts from which they were commenting on posts.

Instead of taking ratings seriously, they went into the vengeance mode, which is so shameful. Absolutely lost faith in the way in which some people run their businesses. Me being a business owner, I hope I never give up on my ethos, and be even 1% like them.

Now I am not sure when they will stop. I had earned 4.8 ratings on Swiggy. But because this is such a small brand with only 31 ratings, the two 1 stars, not given for the coffee but out of vengeance, would affect the rating really badly if you do the maths.

In 1998, I was 20 years old. I took Zyprexa for just one month.
Within weeks, my face blew up with “moon face.” I gained weight so fast it triggered type 2 diabetes. Overnight, I went from “normal” to being laughed at, discriminated against, and rejected.

But the worst part wasn’t the weight. It was what happened in my brain.
Substances that once gave me life — LSD, cannabis, psilocybin, Salvia — suddenly did nothing. It wasn’t tolerance. It was like someone switched off my receptors. The joy, the tears, the music, the transcendence — gone. For 27 years.

Doctors told me it was “schizophrenia.” They blamed me. They told me I was lazy, broken, hopeless. And I believed them for a long time.

But they were wrong.
It wasn’t me — it was the drug.
It was a chemical lobotomy.

It took me decades of pain, research, and connection with other survivors to figure out what had really happened — and how to start undoing it. I put it all together in a memoir and protocol, not because I want to sell something, but because I don’t want anyone else to lose 27 years like I did.

👉 I also started a petition because it’s insane that Zyprexa (olanzapine) is still handed out like candy. Please sign — we need voices.

And if what I’ve put together helps you, and you want to “buy me a coffee,” that’s cool — but my main goal is to get this information into survivor hands. Some of you may need it urgently.

I know that it is my responsibility to make a decision to change my life. I am not here to blame anyone because that would be easy. I just need some sound advice if you were in my situation.

Background:
I grew up in Chicago and I have a younger brother. For a while I lived on my own but I moved back with my parents a year ago. I have almost 10 k in debt. I have a worthless business degree from Urbana Champaign and I am lost as to what to do next. Most of my college buddies have gotten married and have kids. I am behind. I attempted to do a painting business but I don’t like doing the work and everyone wants cheap labor. I only did it because my uncle convince me it will make money. In my personal experience it is labor intensive and getting good paying customers is very difficult. After a while I was working more hours with less pay at my bank job. 

I attempted to become a financial advisor for Mutual of Omaha but I struggled to get leads and dislike selling health and life insurance. I only got 1 sale out of pity. I also didn’t like my manager

I work for the Illinois Tollway in procurement but the pay is low and I’m learning nothing exciting. I feel drained every time I am working. The worst part is I have to go to the office twice a week now. Getting a new job with decent pay is like going into Harvard. I earn 45k, and 6k so far with Uber. I also own a property on the side but had to do a major repair.

Possible Routes

I am thinking of either opening a mobile coffee shop for weddings, corporate events, and church outings with a potential business partner, doing a online clothing brand which I already have the website for or being a cop. I only need to pass the physical test and the medical screening and then I will be accepted into the academy. I only did it because I felt I had no options last year. I talked to therapist, career counselors, my parents as to what I can do but it seems that it doesn’t work. 

All I want is to own a business that provides value and solve problems but that can be anything. I know I used to like design, doing science experiments,
make cringey videos, travel, attend music festivals, learn from business owners. Almost everyone I meet is a business owner, does content creation, or a high paying job. I am a loser. I am just having a hard time deciding what to do exactly. I am afraid of failure and starting over. My attention span, self doubt, and weakness is keeping me from acting. I am also a creature of habit watching videos on self help and entrepreneurship but I don’t act on making a decision.  I know not making a decision is worse. So what is the best suggestion that you guys have to finally act and stay consistent? For example,buy a coffee cart and make videos on how to make coffee or buy a cash flowing business like a car wash by taking out a HELOC out of my property. I don’t want to be in the same position next year. Any successful people or a person who got his/her life together please comment, make a suggestion, or criticize me. I really just want some help.

1ndkelj,https://i.redd.it/3wrwjgvifdof1.jpeg,"Just did 2400 miles from North West to Poland and back and absolutely loved every second of it, apart from Rastplatz areas in Germany. Always wanted to do an Eurotrip, and here are my thoughts:","- The only time someone flashed their lights at me or honked was in England, when I was doing 50 on a 50, funnily enough it happened twice, when I was driving there and when I was driving back. The 50 was permanent in circle on the motorway information board. 
- Our (English) service stations aren't as frequent as in Belgium, Holland, Germany and Poland, but are cleaner, more modern and most importantly free (and so are the Polish ones, everywhere else it's €1 PER PERSON). Can't speak of France as I was there for about 30 minutes before I reached Belgium and I haven't seen a single petrol station. 
- Petrol is so much more expensive in Belgium, Netherlands and Germany. Poland is on par with England. 
- There are free rest zones with toilets called ""Rastplatz"" in Germany but the state of those... Seriously the smell, the dirt, there was literally sh*t outside of them. 
- I don't expect everyone to speak English obviously, so I had to use live translate or show on my fingers I want to pay for pump no X at the petrol stations in Germany, or to get a coffee. Weirdly enough the closer I got to Berlin the worse it got with communication. No such issue in Netherlands, Belgium. Not sure about Poland, as I'm polish :-) 
- We have the worse roads here in England. Belgium and Netherlands motorways were so nice to drive on, Germany a mix of both nice and not so nicr, Poland unless you're on a motorway (and even then it's not always great), is still 20 years behind with their road quality. 
- The road manners are amazing in Germany, Belgium and Netherlands, England and Poland were the worst. Was so much fun to close the Speedo on autobahn (where allowed) :-) It's so nice to not see too many lane hoggers. I've found German drivers really nice and polite behind the wheel or when chatting at a Rastplatz etc. I talk a lot about Germany, because France was about 30 mins, Belgium and Netherlands about 1hr each to pass, and going West to East in Germany was about 9hrs so I've spent most of the time on autobahns there. 
- Surprisingly driving on the ""opposite side of the road"" was very easy, but that's probably because I'm a SUV wanker and can see clearly what's in front of me sitting higher up, unless there's a lorry. However there weren't too many of them and when they are there, they don't take up 3 lanes out of 4 overtaking each other. 
- The only place where I had to pay any kind of toll was a DART charge in England but you can avoid that slightly. The motorway from Dunkirk to Belgium (Antwerp) is free. So were the Motorways in Belgium, Netherlands and Germany. In Poland it depends on where you are going. 
- We have achieved close to 39 MPG with fully loaded boot and a family of 4 in a 2.2 tonne SUV with a 3.5L V6 and electric motors, on a motorway doing 70 MPH (apart from a couple of stints where I closed the Speedo on autobahn). I take that as a win. 
- It was the most comfortable drive I've had in any of the cars I've owned (including LS430 and 3GS450h!).
- There were a lot of chairs and 1(yes one) sofa on the ferry from Dover to Dunkirk (and back), so I would highly recommend either a small inflatable mattress or connecting chairs to form a bed if you want to take a nap on a ferry but it was cheaper than tunnel by about £130, plus you could stretch your legs, eat something at a restaurant and grab a hot drink.

Here is a very quick rundown of my symptoms to see if you are in relation and maybe what I went through can assist you?  


* Blocked tubes that wouldn't open for anything
* Sound distortion for certain decibel noises (practically sounded like deep thumping bass from electronics (such as air conditioner units) and rubber tires over pavement from traffic)
* Loud velcro sounds within the tubes as they open (far more noticeable if you have the ability to flex your tensor tympani muscle to open your tube at will), 
* Very slight ear aching, 
* Feeling of fullness. 
* Small, white discharge from nostrils over a month in

**What I went through and timeline:**  
  
**June 2025 -** The first sign something was off was the persistent noise of deep bass from nearly everything. I was at the point where I swore my neighbors bought a system and started going crazy with it. It wasn't a ""feel"" type of bass, but one akin to a car with rolled up windows, thumping it from within that was parked nearby. Distorted and soft but severely annoying. There was nothing wrong with my ears yet that I felt but it was tremendously awful for me because bass is the one noise I absolutely cannot stand. However the indicator that finally clicked that it was me in general was when I laid down on my pillow one night a week later and within the ear I was laying down on had this weird sensation of tiny bubbles coming up from deep in my ear and escaping out my ear canal. Like tiny beads coming up one by one. This was in my left ear. I was incredibly confused. They kept coming up and escaping no matter what position I shuffled myself in.  
  
After that, the bass noise was worse and now both my ears started to feel a bit full as my right ear was now closed off too (but without the air bubble event that happened with my left ear.) There was never any discharge on my pillows when I awoke. I finally connected the noise to certain decibels when I walked through a store and, as this was summer, the a/c blowing from the ceiling sounded like an idle semi-truck was parked in the building with a bass beat. I turned off my a/c in my house and part of the noise went away. I also connected that even my refrigerator, when the condenser was going, was a culprit of the same noise. After I turned off that and unplugged the fridge, I had brief relief. Though my house is also 3 streets away from a main road. The sound of the wheels of cars bouncing off of pavement was interpreted in my mind as bass noise as well. It was pure awful. Sounds of things I watched on TV had a weird under water distortion filter to it. I could hear it, but I heard it weirdly. 

For this first month, I didn't know what to do and I had no method to help remedy it other than an ENT appointment. I suffered and broke down a lot as the bass noise fluctuated from somewhat bearable to unbearable. (This was not pulsatile tinnitus, I've had that before, this was not stemming from me as I checked that)  


**July 2025 -** Pinching and blowing my nose did nothing. No matter what I did, it would not open. The Eustachi did nothing, the balloon device thing (I forgot the name) did nothing. The ENT was absolutely worthless as I paid $300 to be literally told word for word ""I don't know."" He told me to do the Valsalva maneuver every 2 hours and that's all he did for me. I did, however, get the Neti-Pot on my own and do a sinus rinse every morning. \*details on how I used it will be farther down\* and my left ear did actually have some air go through to the top a few weeks in, but not all the way through. I took that as a small success as later when I would Valsalva, the air still wouldn't open the tube barely at all without the Neti-Pot help. I also started Nasacort after reading that allery nasal sprays help with inflammation as well. \*details on how I used it will be farther down\*  
  
But to fast forward, the one moment later on in the month that was the golden puzzle piece was when I was breaking down from a bad noise episode and blew out snot from my nose from crying, a very thick, white chunky small dot of mucus came out with it. Stringy like mozzarella cheese when I peeled apart the napkin I blew into. It started to make sense and I could finally piece it together:  
  
\*In June I was under immense stress, where your body is so worn down that you wake up feeling sick symptoms but have no physical sick symptoms. You feel so tired, like something is horrendously wrong. That's what chronic stress feels like. Apparently during that time, stress tells your body makes a bunch of Cortisol. Cortisol normally alleviates inflammation but it also can cause it when you have too much.  Cortisol inflames the eustachian tubes and makes them seal shut. That's what the ""air dots escaping"" from last month was. The tube sealing the last bit off. Followed by the right tube sealing a few days later. Mucus production was ramped up from stress as well and became caught behind the tube and turned extremely viscous from being caught and from increased mucus production from the stress. It turned solid white in color and insanely sticky and moves like a very, very slow slinky through it all.\*   
  
Your eustachian tubes are the worst place to expel mucus like this from since the top 1/3rd is bone and incredibly narrow and the bottom 2/3rds narrow cartilage, but flexible. So all this leftover mucus gunk was trying to come out and when these ""plugs"" were coming out, it amplified the disruptive noise filter even further and made the tube feel so full and irritated understandably. The chunk caused the terrible episode that caused me to break down that day. Once it was out, I was back to how I was being ""normally"" - normally being the terrible baseline of all this. So with this new information, I made a plan and started it for the second half of this month.



**August 2025 -** The first half of August was a bit rough. Though near the end of August, a month and a half on the routine I made, started showing significant improvement. Now I can Valsalva and the air goes nearly all the way up my tubes and stops at the bone section, the area where mucus can't really travel down easily. Then the trapped air bubbles slowly creep out. My tubes started to sound like someone was slowly pulling apart velcro in my ears. The mucus was thinning and becoming stuck to the walls like a lining and are pulling apart, trying to stay open. My tubes were open enough to start draining. Noise is still bad but there are signs of so much improvement now.   
  
A/c noises in stores started to normalize. I would stop in the middle of the store thinking ""Oh my god... I hear almost nothing from the ceiling now. This sounds so bizarre."" Valsalva allowed air to go nearly all the way through my tubes but with a bit of delay near the top, but not fully stop as it did before. Though it still has bubble delay in the right since it was the second ear to shut, it lags behind in healing. Though I still cannot plug in my fridge again, some decibel levels will take more time to normalize as your brain recalibrates noises with your ear again. Traffic from the main roads nearby still sound a bit like subwoofer bass as cars drive across pavement, but not as strong.

  
**Sept 2025 -**  Three months in and traffic sounds near normal again. I still can't plug in my fridge (I had a mini hotel fridge in the back room that I've been using this whole time) but it's really only a matter of time now as my brain catches up on sounds. My own a/c in my house sounds halfway to normal now. Before, it was absolutely unbearable. I figure the end of this month, I should be pretty much normalized. My ears just make very faint clicking noises. Maybe one or two clicks. No velcro noise anymore. The last little bit of mucus is thinning out, it's just the bone area is extremely stubborn. It sticks in there stretched across on the sides like a trampoline film. That's what the clicking is. But it will thin out enough eventually.

  
***This is my routine:***

Morning: 

* Neti-Pot Rinse - (distilled water is ultra important) with the included salt, heat it for about 10 seconds in the microwave to make it very slightly warm. Lean forward with your head tilted and pour it down the upper nostril. Blow it all out into a napkin, turn head and start over again into the other nostril. (I find that with the water a bit warm, you get more of those little, white dots out that way when you blow your nose. Sometimes I got 5 dots. A few times I got a whole white plug that was the entire length of the eustachean tube!)
* Nasacort - Use after the Neti-Pot clears out your sinuses and it's not as moist. About 10 minutes after. It's the generic one that is over the counter. Spray it with your head down, facing the floor and insert the nozzle parallel with your nose. Then tilt it towards the eye on the side of the nostril you have it in. Do the same for the other side and then sniff a TINY bit. Breathe through your mouth for 10-15 minutes as the formula soaks in.
* Ashwangandha Gummies - Lowers cortisol. 2 gummies. (super important)
* Vitamin C - 2 gummies. Helps with immune system/reduces inflammation
* NAC Supplements - Mucus thinner and makes it less sticky
* Mucinex - combined with NAC is the best combo. (You HAVE to drink lots of water for this to work, Caffeine is a diuretic, it will dehydrate you and pretty much cause this combo to do near nothing. So if you have to, drink very little pop or coffee and counter that with more water intake)

Night:

* Neti-Pot Rinse
* Nasacort
* NAC + Mucinex and bottle of water right before sleep. As in directly before I lay down to sleep as NAC lasts for 5-6 hours.

I live with BPD, depression, social anxiety, and daddy issues. That means I get attached really quickly if I like someone. So please, if you’re not serious about building a friendship (or more, if it happens naturally), don’t waste my time.

About me: Age: 19 Height: 163cm, Weight: 55kg Personality type: INFP-T

Escaping a toxic family situation soon and planning to seek asylum in London (I’m from Kuwait). That’s why if things ever go beyond friendship, the person must be living in the UK and older than me. I don’t want long-distance relationships.

I used to be Muslim, but I’ve left religion. I still believe in a Creator, just not in organized faiths.

What I like & value: Honest, genuine people who appreciate feelings.

Deep talks, not shallow convos or cold replies.

Space, astronomy, music (I’m obsessed with songs), nature, rain, coffee, matcha, and sometimes video games.

People who can respect boundaries and give back the same energy.

I love when people value me as much as I value them.

What I dislike: Narcissists (stay away, I can’t stand them).

Fake, exploitative people — if I notice someone is using me, I cut them off like they never existed.

Surface-level friendships that disappear fast.

Important: If anyone tries to get close romantically: know that if I love you, I’ll get very clingy, obsessed, and stalker-ish. If you can’t handle that, better not even try.

I can be crazy and weird sometimes, and other times quiet and sad for no reason.

I’m shy in real life, and it takes time for me to feel safe enough to show my true self.

What I usually listen to: Melanie Martinez - Lana del rey - Billie Eilish - Cigarettes After Sex - Arctic Monkeys - Halsey - Radiohead - Aurora - Beach House - The Neighbourhood and more..

Extra fun fact: I have a thing for dilfs (xoxo).

If you want to talk, introduce yourself properly. If you don’t, I won’t reply.

I want a friendship that’s sweet, deep, and real, not something temporary or superficial.",1,1757524732.0,Needafriend,1,0.67,False

1ndkcu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1ndkcu0/things_will_fall_into_place/,Things will fall into place,"I read a lot about how people wonder how exactly the desire will come into fruition. This is also emphasised while they struggle to “let go”. People often obsess over how exactly the manifestation will occur and how it’s going to come into their existence. This only pushes your manifestation further away from you. 

The only job you have when it comes to manifesting is to decide what you want and believe you have it with full conviction. You once wanted the device you’re reading this on, we can all agree it would be ludicrous if you doubted you had it. Imagine waking up one day, the device is in front of you, and you just decide to doubt that you have it - it doesn’t make sense. You either believe you have your desire or you don’t. There is no book on the law of assumption or attraction that tell you that you need to do certain methods or tricks to get your desire. You don’t need to script, repeat you have your desire 100 times, sats, believe in the 3D/4D shtick - you only need to believe. Why do you manifest certain things so easy? Because you don’t have resistance to it. When you start to doubt your manifestation that’s when you push that manifestation further away from you. 

Things will fall into place if you just let it. That’s not your job to decide how and when it will come. If it were your job to make the effort to make that desire come to you, imagine how difficult it would be to control absolutely everything you manifested. This is why we need God. God does the work for you if you believe. Imagine two people they both want to get into the best shape possible. person A works out everyday, goes to the gym, eats well, trusts the process. Person B sits around all day doing affirmations “I’m fit I’m fit I’m fit”, is a couch potato, eats horribly, blames others for his weight, always says “tomorrow I’ll make effort”. Who do you think believes in themselves more to get that desire? Who is more capable of having that desire and taking care of it? Who made space for that desire to come into their existence? Sometimes that’s all we need to do, make space for the desire to come. 

That’s believing in your desire but next level. When you start to change your life to fit your desire, you’re telling God that you believe in yourself so much that you know you’ll get your desire. You have the easy job, you only have to believe with conviction. The rest? The how, the where, the when. That’s an unnecessary thought because if you had what you wanted, you’d have what you wanted. If you make yourself a cup of coffee, you’re not going to wonder when that cup of coffee is going to appear in front of you. You completely contradict yourself when you wonder about the how or what. Let go of resistance, and have conviction in your manifestation. ",3,1757524679.0,lawofassumption,0,1.0,False
1ndkcb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1ndkcb7/explore_why_picreator_wax_polish_is_a_top_pick/,Explore Why Picreator Wax Polish Is a Top Pick for Wood Care,"Renaissance Micro-Crystalline Wax Polish (65 ml) caught my attention due to its intriguing backstory and impressive reputation. Developed by the British Museum in the 1950s for fine art conservation, it’s a wax polish that promises to restore, refresh, and protect a variety of surfaces. For someone who dabbles in restoring old furniture and occasionally polishing antiques, I had to give this product a try. Over the past few weeks, I’ve put it to the test on everything from wooden furniture to metal fixtures, even an old leather-bound book. Let’s dive into the merits and potential shortcomings of this highly-rated wax polish.

**Application and Ease of Use**  
This 65 ml can of wax polish might look small, but the amount of surface area it covers is astounding. A little goes a long way, which I quickly learned after using it on the armrest of my vintage oak chair. The instructions suggest applying sparingly with a soft cloth, which turned out to be excellent advice. The wax spreads easily and dries hard almost instantly. In terms of ease of use, I appreciated that it didn’t leave any streaks or greasy residue. Even on leather surfaces, like a beloved wallet I’ve owned for years, the application process was surprisingly smooth. Polishing didn’t demand excessive elbow grease, which was a relief.

**Effectiveness on Various Surfaces**  
One selling point that stood out was its versatility. The description claimed it could be used on wood, metal, leather, and even paper. Naturally, I approached this with skepticism—who waxes paper anyway? But curiosity got the better of me, and I tested it on an old inkjet gloss print. To my surprise, the result was subtle but effective; the print looked freshened without altering its original sheen. On metals, like an antique brass candle holder, it worked wonders, reducing tarnish while enhancing the shine. For wooden furniture, the soft sheen it imparted was unparalleled, breathing life back into my slightly faded coffee table.

**Perks**  
- A small amount covers an impressive area  
- Works effectively on multiple materials, including leather and metal  
- Dries instantly and leaves no sticky residue  
- Freshens colors and improves aesthetic appeal of antiques  

[Grab Renaissance Micro-Crystalline Wax Polish (65 ml) at the best price on Amazon.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b001dszwem/)

**Target Audience**  
If you’re the type of person who enjoys maintaining furniture, art pieces, or household items, then this polish is for you. Art conservators and professionals in restoration projects would especially appreciate its high efficacy. Even casual users like me can find ways to integrate it into daily maintenance tasks. For instance, I used it on the leather strap of an old watch and on the legs of a metal stool in my workshop. It performed impressively in both cases. 

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
Unfortunately, no product is perfect, and there were minor issues worth pointing out.  
- Limited quantity in the 65 ml can, meaning frequent buyers might need to reorder if using it regularly  
- The initial scent is strong, though it dissipates quickly  
- Requires careful application on intricate surfaces to avoid over-polishing  

**Competing Options**  
There are alternatives on the market, like Minwax’s Paste Finishing Wax or Howard Feed-N-Wax Wood Polish. Minwax offers a comparable finish on wood surfaces, pricing at a slightly lower point, but it doesn’t provide the same versatility for metals and leathers. Howard Feed-N-Wax leans more into conditioning wood but lacks the instant-drying feature I found in this micro-crystalline polish. While Minwax is solid for woodworking enthusiasts, Renaissance Wax truly shines for those requiring a broader range of applications.

**Financial Value**  
Evaluating the price-to-quality ratio, the cost is reasonable for what you get. While it might seem a bit pricey for a 65 ml can, the results speak for themselves. It’s economical in practice, as even a small dab can work across multiple surfaces. Considering the professional-grade output and its history of being developed for museums, I’d say it’s worth every penny.

When it was rescheduled, I lost motivation because the location was so far from me. What hurt was that he considered the convenience of other friends but not mine. I ended up not going.

I told him I felt taken for granted, but he brushed it off by saying “kasi sila nag-aadjust sa sched ko.” The thing is, I would too if I was included in the planning. Recently, I even snapped when he did not wait for me before starting a game, and he just ignored me.

Just wanted people to be aware! 
Mortenson  Dentist
1430 Poplar Level Rd, Louisville, KY 40217

I called Humana Dental to find out why I was in the situation I am in today and I learned information I did not know until today! I filed a claim with Humana dental for negligence for dentist Rohini Sharma , while they worked at Mortenson dentist Poplar Level Rd (they are no longer a dentist at this location) in Louisville and did X-rays in Oct 2024. My Humana dental plan covered full X-rays, panoramic whatever, full periooptical X rays and not just bite wing that only shows the front of tooth and I have over 10 filings already with history of braces and periodontal disease and gum grafts, unfortunately Rohini Sharma only did a “bite wing X Ray” even though Humana dental would have been happy to cover an xray for each entire tooth. I will be fighting a claim against Dr Rohini Sharma for abuse and negligence to me as a patient and Rohini Sharma also has negatively affected Humana Dental because you are 100 percent guilty of negligence. Hopefully I can see this person in court. 

This dentist at same location as her replacement , Dr Hernandez did do a periooptical X Ray for my August 2025 visit after I requested to have X Rays. Unfortunately I will never go back here. 

The rest of this story is more of a rant and is the aftermath of dentist Rohini Sharma only doing a “bite wing Xray when my plan covered a full X ray and I already have all the filings I have! Probably even more than 10!! 


RANT PORTION of information
—-
Even though I said I do not feel the front of the tooth , for some reason the dentist wanted to use her tool and scrap the front of the tooth anyway right after I said I don’t feel the front which is fine but, she then decided to scrap with her tool exactly (while seeing it and looking at it) where there is a demarcation tiny dark dot . She targeted this tiny dot even though I said I don’t not feel the front of the tooth. Did not know I already had a filing in the tooth I got a second filing in until I came back because I can now feel the tooth on a daily basis over week after the filing. I should have made sure to ask and I should have made sure I said “does this tooth already have a filing in it?” I was given a desensitized agent on tooth and they were able to get me in quickly because of pain after a filing for the first time in my life. Dental hygentist needed to mention her family members dental care. Very insensitive behavior. You do not need to attach your families dental care to a patient coming in. Then the same dental hygienist skipped over half of the teeth while doing a flouride treatment. Then the dental hygienist acknowledged painting my gums with the fluoride treatment.  Same dental hygienist did the filing material for my cavity. Unfortunately first time in my life I have had pain after a filing and it has continued since.  I went back and the dentist actually did put the fluoride varnish on my teeth, she spent about the same amount of time, but she actually did each tooth.  Staff also does not know what offerings they have at this office. I guess they are not provided a list of services for their job. I had the same dentist for over a decade and her house was right by her office,  I wonder why she never once mentioned any dental work her family had had?

Imagine waking up in the morning, sipping your coffee, and knowing your computer worked overnight to make you cash. It sounds too good to be true, but it’s not. With a few smart strategies and a solid setup, you can turn your PC into a silent money-making machine. Let’s dive into the best passive income tricks to get paid while your PC runs.

**1. Idle Resource Sharing**  
One of the most straightforward ways to earn passive income is by letting your computer share its unused resources. Many networks reward users for contributing a slice of their CPU power, bandwidth, or storage space. It’s a win-win: you help power global networks or distributed systems, and you get paid just for keeping your device on.

**2. Automated Investing Bots**  
If you dabble in crypto or stock markets, consider running automated bots that make trades for you while you sleep. These bots analyze trends, react to changes instantly, and work tirelessly. While you should always manage your risk and stay informed, this method can generate solid returns with little day-to-day involvement.

**3. Cloud Computing Participation**  
Some programs allow users to rent out unused GPU or processing power for high-demand computing tasks. Whether it's helping render videos, train AI models, or support large-scale data projects, your idle PC can be contributing to massive operations—and you collect the rewards.

**4. Data Crunching for Research Projects**  
Many global initiatives need help processing large data sets. By running approved software on your machine, you become part of something bigger—whether it’s medical research, space exploration, or climate modeling. Not only is this rewarding financially, but it’s also fulfilling knowing your PC is making a difference.

**5. Hosting a Personal Server**  
With a stable internet connection, your computer can host files, apps, or even websites for others. It’s like running your own tiny digital hotel. As long as your PC is running and accessible, you can charge others for access or storage.

**alsurf.pro** is another keyword to keep in mind when exploring passive income ideas. It’s essential to stay informed, test different options, and protect your device and data. With patience and the right tools, turning your PC into a passive income generator is not only possible—it’s practical.

So, power on, sit back, and let your computer work for you. The silent hum of a running PC just might be the sound of money.",1,1757523982.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

1ndjzue,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1ndjzue/reveal_how_binbata_laundry_detergent_sheets_hold/,Reveal How Binbata Laundry Detergent Sheets Hold Up for Sensitive Skin,"Binbata laundry detergent sheets, model ""200 Count Fragrance-Free,"" ended up being a surprisingly delightful addition to my regular chore routine. I mean, let's be honest here—laundry is nobody's favorite. But when the product claims to be eco-friendly, hypoallergenic, biodegradable, and perfect for sensitive skin, I felt intrigued enough to give it a go. Turns out, ditching the massive jugs of liquid detergent and opting for these paper-thin, liquidless strips might just be one of the smartest moves I've made in reducing my household waste.

**Compact and Practical Design**  
The genius of these detergent sheets lies in their sheer compactness. If you're familiar with how much space traditional liquid detergents take up in your storage cabinet, this product is like a breath of fresh air. These thin, card-sized strips come in a box that easily fits on a pantry shelf, meaning no more dragging around heavy, bulky bottles. I’ve got a large family and do multiple loads every week, so the convenience these sheets offer for storage and handling feels life-simplifying. The portability factor stands out too; we even popped them in our luggage on a recent camping trip, avoiding spills and mess! 

[Check Binbata 200 Count Fragrance-Free price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b0bz449p9g/)

**Cleaning Power That Punches Above Its Weight**  
At first glance, I honestly doubted a single strip could clean a load of dirty clothes. I was wrong. While testing it on a typical laundry basket filled with everything from muddy kids’ clothes to coffee-stained shirts, it handled stains impressively well. These strips incorporate a polymer concentration technology with enzymatic cleaning agents, softeners, and water conditioners all packed into one thin strip. I didn’t expect much from something so minimal, but by the end of each load, I found my clothes clean and fresh—minus any residue.

**Environmentally Friendly and Plastic-Free Approach**  
Eco-consciousness is a big deal for me, and this product nails it. Compared to conventional liquid or powder detergents, these sheets eliminate the need for plastic packaging entirely, offering a recyclable box instead. I was pleasantly surprised by how such a small change in my daily routine could reduce my household’s carbon footprint. Additionally, the production and transportation of these sheets reportedly use less fuel and result in fewer emissions, which is a massive win for anyone trying to live more sustainably.

**Gentle on Skin, Tough on Stains**  
My youngest has eczema-prone skin, so I always look for hypoallergenic options when choosing detergents. These fragrance-free sheets were particularly appealing since they’re made from plant-based ingredients like coconut oil and sapindus mukurossi. I noticed there were no harsh chemicals like phosphates or bleach commonly found in other detergents. Clothes came out soft, with no weird residue or lingering perfumes that might irritate sensitive skin. It’s a quiet hero for families with little ones or anyone prone to allergies. Trust me, this was a huge relief.

**Dissolves Seamlessly in All Water Types**  
One complaint I’ve read about similar products is how poorly they dissolve, especially in cold or hard water. I kept an eye out for this issue, as my area has moderately hard water. Thankfully, Binbata seems to have addressed this with a mix of anionic and non-ionic surfactants. The strips dissolved almost immediately without leaving chunks or residue stuck on clothing. Whether I tried them in a hot wash for towels or a cold cycle for delicates, the performance remained consistent. No residue, no sticky mess.

**Highlights**  
- Ultra-compact design saves storage space and makes it easy to travel with.  
- Exceptional cleaning power for something that looks so minimalistic.  
- Environmentally friendly, completely plastic-free packaging.  
- Safe for sensitive skin, thanks to natural, plant-based ingredients.  
- Dissolves perfectly in all water temperatures and types.

**Areas of Concern**  
- For heavily soiled or extremely large loads, using more than one sheet seems necessary.  
- It lacks a distinct fragrance, which some might miss if they enjoy perfumed laundry.  
- The sheets feel slightly thin, so handling them with wet hands can be tricky.

**Alternative Offerings**  
If I had to compare, Tru Earth and Earth Breeze are two close competitors in the eco-detergent space. Tru Earth also offers similar ultra-concentrated paper-thin detergent strips, but they tend to lean pricier. On the performance front, Binbata seems to do just as well in stain removal tests, and I appreciated its specific focus on biodegradable and plastic-free practices. Earth Breeze, though slightly cheaper, doesn’t feel as skin-friendly as Binbata. For me, the deciding factor comes down to how gentle Binbata is without compromising on the cleaning power—it just offers more peace of mind for families dealing with allergies.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Looking at both its positives and occasional setbacks, I genuinely feel like the investment in these laundry sheets is justified. They hit the sweet spot between quality and environmental responsibility. Even if you need to use extra sheets for larger or dirtier loads, the convenience factor and eco-friendliness are worth it. Having tested it side by side with competitors, it feels like one of the smarter purchases I’ve made to steer my home away from wasteful habits.

  HELENA SQUEEZED THE WOODEN SHIP railing until her knuckles whitened. Trying to control the turmoil of her emotions, she took a deep breath of fresh, salty air and let it out slowly. Her heart still thundered in her chest... Am I really going through with this?  
  
  An eerie feeling washed over her, making the hair on the back of her neck stand on end. She scanned her surroundings uneasily. The ship deck was full of people—mostly families. What about him? she wondered, and releasing the railing, turned on her heel. A tall, slim man dressed in black, standing on the other side of the deck, stared at her intensely with piercing eyes. Helena swallowed hard. Pushing back the fear, she stared right back at him. Being among so many people gave her a sense of security. The man hesitated for a moment and then walked away.  
  
  Stop being paranoid! she reprimanded herself. There’s nothing to worry about… then again, what was that last night? she shivered, thinking of the night before when someone accidentally bumped into her on the pavement in front of her hotel and pushed her right in front of a speeding car. If the hotel concierge hadn’t pulled me back at the very last minute… She closed her eyes and shook her head to clear her gloomy thoughts. Everything is going to be all right, she tried to persuade herself. I need to do this… I need to do it for my father… I need to do it for myself…  
  
  A little girl’s laughter brought her back to reality. She turned and looked at the happy, little face... I could have been happy like that, if only…  
  
  Closing her eyes, she leaned her head back and stood still, enjoying the caress of the warm sunlight on her face and the revitalizing sea breeze blowing softly through her hair. What an amazing sensation! She opened her eyes and let the captivating scenery fill her vision. It took her breath away. This is how Dad must have felt every time he stood on the bridge of his ship. She leaned against the railing, mesmerized by the magnificent view of the crystal clear, sapphire waters of the Aegean Sea. Her thoughts flew back to cherished memories of her childhood, and she was overwhelmed. She could hardly wait…  
  
  Feeling restless, she looked around her, wondering how much longer it would take them to get there. Mykonos was only a few hours trip from Athens, but it seemed like ages to her.  
  
  It had been thirteen years since she last saw the amazing, blue waters of the Aegean and the beautiful island where she was born. She had been only eight years old when her father was declared dead, and her mother, heartbroken, took little Helena to England.  
  
  Since then, the shadows of the past kept her mother away from the island she used to adore. Only after her mother’s death had Helena decided to come back to meet her only living relatives, and to try to unravel the mystery surrounding her father’s death.  
  
  Now, as the ship approached the shores of Mykonos, Helena closed her eyes and saw her mother’s pale face, staring at her with eyes wide open from anxiety and fear. Don’t go back! Don’t ever go back! I want you to promise me… Helena could still hear her soft, trembling voice whispering while she was squeezing her hand tightly.  
  
  Helena swallowed hard, feeling her heart flutter wildly. I have nothing to worry about, she tried to reassure herself. All she needed were some answers, and after that, she would head back to England, and go on with her life. However, deep down inside, she knew it wasn’t going to be that simple. Deep down inside, she had this eerie feeling that destiny was waiting just around the corner for her…  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  Thinking back, she could vividly remember her happy childhood. They used to live in a big, white house on top of a cliff, overlooking the Aegean. She would wake up in the morning and run to her balcony to enjoy the breathtaking view.  
  
  Her parents were so happy back then. The main offices of her father’s shipping company were in Piraeus—the harbor of Athens—but he ran the business mainly from the island, in order to spend as much time as possible with her mother and her.  
  
  Mykonos was a beautiful island, which took her mother’s breath away when she stepped foot on it as a young bride twenty-two years before. The beauty of the land and the kindness of the people kept her captive for a long time. Erin, Helena’s mother, was hopelessly in love with her husband, Captain Angelos Sistakis, and never regretted following him to his homeland, or leaving London, with its cloudy days, behind.  
  
  The sunshine in Greece warmed people’s hearts; something about all these islands spread across the Aegean captivated their souls, and they never wanted to leave.  
  
  That’s precisely the way Helena felt when her mother told her they were leaving. She’d cried and pleaded to stay, but her mother’s decision was final. Her father’s mysterious disappearance had broken her mother’s heart, and the place had lost its magic touch. Her mother just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible and leave the memories behind.  
  
  However, her mother never forgot  
the love she and Angelos shared and the happy moments at their house on the island. She spent the rest of her life bitter and miserable. Two years ago, she became sick. Helena watched her slowly fade away and wondered if she even tried to recover.  
  
  For the last thirteen years, her mother hadn’t been the same cheerful and lively woman she used to be. She never got over her husband’s tragic death, but deep down inside, Helena knew it was a lot more than that… her mother feared for her little girl’s life. She was convinced Angelos’ death wasn’t an accident, and that Helena was in grave danger, as well…  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  The beauty in front of her interrupted her thoughts. She took a deep breath, staring at the shores of Mykonos with the scenic coves and the golden sand beaches. Welcome home, Helena… Her heartbeat accelerated, and anticipation washed over her like a cold wave. Tears filled her eyes, seeing her homeland… the land of her adorable father… the land of her ancestors. She was finally home—the home she’d been deprived of for so long…  
  
  She wiped the tears with the back of a shaky hand. It was so unfair to lose her father at such a tender age, and to be deprived of everything and everyone she ever knew. Helena, however, knew her mother was scared; she was scared to death. She lived the rest of her life with a threat hovering over her, every step of the way. Was it real? Helena wondered, and the scene of the previous night’s near miss flashed before her eyes. Was any of it real? Helena had thought about it a million times. The only thing she was sure about was that the threat felt real to her mother.  
  
  And what about Grandma’s diary? Helena wondered. According to her mother, Eleana—Angelos’ mother—had a gift of foreseeing future events and had written them down in her diary. A lot of important events that affected their lives were written down in her diary… years before they happened. If only I could find that diary, Helena inwardly wished. She needed to find it, not only to get some answers, but to verify it actually existed. Sometimes, she was worried about her mother’s state of mind. Maybe the pain and years of bitterness had affected her and made her imagine things. Finding that diary would prove her mother wasn’t hallucinating, and this was essential to Helena, since her mother had been the center of her world since they left Greece. And now, she was gone, too.  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  As the ship came around a small peninsula, Helena held her breath, looking at the cubed-shaped, white houses of Chora—as the town of Mykonos was commonly known—glowing in the sunlight. Picturesque windmills and countless churches were scattered higher up on the hill, composing a breathtaking picture.  
  
  The port was overflowing with life. Numerous ships and colorful fishing boats were anchored everywhere, while dozens of little shops were scattered all over the waterfront. People strolled along the dock, enjoying the beautiful, sunny day.  
  
  The ship moved closer, and Helena’s heartbeat accelerated. Conflicting emotions of excitement and anxiety made her feel dizzy and disoriented. She felt as if she were floating loose in time and space…  
  
  Helena saw people sitting at tables outside the cafes in the shade of pergolas, lazily drinking their afternoon coffee while kids attacked their ice creams, piled to the top with fruits and nuts. She was so impatient; she could hardly wait for the ship to dock. Squeezing her way through the numerous passengers, she managed to be among the first ones to walk off.  
  
  Once she stepped foot on the ground, she felt lost with so many people around—passengers disembarking the ship and workers running back and forth, carrying luggage and boxes.  
  
  She stood undecided, letting her eyes wander over the colorful surroundings and listening to people talking in Greek… so fascinating and so different than speaking Greek at school.  
  
  Helena had been bilingual since birth. After they moved to England, her mother had sent her to a Greek school in the afternoons, so she continued her education in the Greek language, as well. Speaking Greek helped her remain connected to her late father and the life she was forced to leave behind.  
  
  Suddenly, she realized people were staring at her. She could see admiration mixed with curiosity in their glances. She knew she had inherited her mother’s tall and slim stature along with her long, silky blonde hair and expressive blue eyes. Among the dark-haired Greeks with the bronzed by the sun bodies, her pale complexion left her out of place.  
  
  Where is my ride? By now, they knew she was coming. She hadn’t written from England, as she wasn’t sure whether she was going through with this visit. When she arrived in Athens, though, she called her Aunt Sophie and told her she was on her way to the island.  
  
  Sophie Sistakis was her father’s younger sister, and Helena remembered her kind face with warm, brown eyes surrounded by long, black hair. Her aunt was only eight years older than her and used to take her for walks on the beach, play games with her, and read her stories. She felt ashamed she hadn’t talked to her aunt in all these years. Though her mother didn’t have the right to keep her away from her family, Erin had been scared and heartbroken.  
  
  Somehow, Aunt Sophie understood, and she never tried to invade their privacy.  
  
  The surprise in her aunt’s voice wasn’t unexpected, but the pleasure and excitement she expressed helped Helena move beyond her uncertainty. She didn’t have to explain anything before her aunt had made her feel loved and welcome, simply telling her to catch the next ferry home. Home. Yes, she was finally home.  
  
  “Miss Sistakis?” She jumped, hearing a deep, sensual voice with a thick Greek accent directly behind her.  
  
  She turned to face a tall, seductively handsome man with jet-black hair shining in the sun and the most amazing dark brown eyes she had ever seen. She always considered herself tall, being five feet eight inches, but she felt like a child in front of him. He stood at least five inches taller than her, but his size didn’t intimidate her. The way his dark, captivating eyes looked at her made her feel small and vulnerable, though.  
  
  The handsome face with the strong jaw, and the well-built, muscular body under the sun-tanned skin, accelerated her heartbeat and caused her mouth to go dry.  
  
  Helena hadn’t realized she was staring until she saw the amusement in his eyes and a smile appeared on his inviting lips. He’s laughing at me, and he has every right to do it, she reprimanded herself.  
  
  “Yes, I’m Helena Sistakis… and who are you?” she questioned in English, her voice nothing more than a whisper.  
  
  The man seemed to hesitate for a moment, searching her face. “I’m Dimitris,” he replied finally. His name struck a chord somewhere deep inside her. Bewildered, she studied him for a minute. No, she thought. If we had met before, I would definitely remember such a hunk.  
  
  As his captivating gaze roamed over her, Helena felt butterflies in her stomach. Nervously, she licked her lips and dug her nails into her palms.  
  
  “Has my aunt sent you to take me home?” she inquired, straightening her back and trying to steady her trembling voice.  
  
  “Yes. I’m ready to go when you are. My car is just around the corner,” he replied in Greek, obviously aware she spoke it fluently.  
  
  She reached for her suitcase, and her hand froze on the handle. The man from the ship stood a few feet away, staring at her, seeming totally unaffected by everything going on around him… Helena noticed the round face with the small, piercing eyes that reminded her of a snake. Her blood turned to ice. “What on earth?”  
  
  “Is everything all right?” Dimitris questioned.  
  
  Helena didn’t respond, totally absorbed by the hostile expression on the stranger’s face.  
  
  “Helena…” Dimitris’ voice next to her ear and his warm hand on her arm brought her back to reality.  
  
  She glanced at him, puzzled. Dimitris’ eyes were fixed on her, searching her face. Then he peered at the other man.  
  
  “Who’s that? Do you know him?” he asked.  
  
  “No,” she whispered. “First time I saw him was on the ship. He seemed to be watching me…”  
  
  “Wait here!” Dimitris ordered her and strode towards the man dressed in black.  
  
&nb  
sp; Helena watched as the man hesitated for a moment, turned on his heel, and rushed towards the street. Dimitris swiftly took off right after him, like a panther going after his prey. He was closing in on him when a black Mercedes appeared speeding out of nowhere. As the brakes of the car squeaked right in front of the man, he opened the back door and jumped inside. He had barely closed the door when the car launched forward. Dimitris arrived at the street right at the moment the Mercedes was disappearing around a corner.  
  
  Helena took a deep breath, unable to move. What was that all about? Who was he? What did he want?  
  
  Immobilized, she watched Dimitris reaching in his pocket and getting out his cell phone. He spoke on the phone as he was heading back to her.  
  
  “Is everything all right, Captain?”  
  
  Helena looked at a young sailor who was rushing towards Dimitris.  
  
  “Yes,” Dimitris replied. “Everything is under control,” he added, glancing at the street for one more time.  
  
  The sailor hesitated for a moment, then gave Helena a polite smile, and walked away.  
  
  “We should be going,” Dimitris said, arriving next to her. He picked up her suitcase and pulled her by the arm, leading her on the whitewashed cobble pavement towards the street. She had to run to keep up with him, as he didn’t seem willing to slow down.  
  
  As they came around the corner of a cafe, she stopped dead in her tracks. An impressive Porsche Cayenne Jeep was parked right behind the building, its black color shining in the summer sun like onyx. Helena took a deep breath… her dream car…  
  
  Her thoughts were interrupted as he had already put her suitcase in the vehicle and was holding the door for her to get in. She blushed as their eyes met, and hastily climbed inside. Sinking into the soft leather seat, she admired the luxurious interior and the impressive dashboard. A thrill washed over her. Riding in a Jeep like this was a dream come true. She drew a deep breath and watched Dimitris walk around the vehicle and get in on the driver’s side.

The strong engine came to life, and the car took off. Helena had to hold on to her seat, as he was driving way too fast for these narrow roads. She glanced over at him, trying hard to control her accelerated heartbeat. His eyes were set on the road, and she had a chance to admire the intriguing profile and the broad shoulders. Her gaze moved to the powerful hands with the long fingers holding steadily onto the wheel. A jolt of desire shot right through her. What would it feel like having those hands touching me… caressing me?  
  
  Bewildered, Helena snapped out of it, wondering where these thoughts came from. She hardly knew the man. She took a deep breath and let it out slowly, flexing her hands to release some of the tension. What is the matter with me? she wondered. It’s probably due to the adrenaline rush caused by fear, she decided. It just can’t be him…  
  
  Turning her gaze to the road ahead of them, she took another deep breath, trying to clear the wild thoughts whirling around in her mind.  
  
  She sensed his eyes on her. It took all the strength she could muster to keep from staring back at him. The proximity in the confined area of the car was bad enough; she couldn’t handle getting lost in those gorgeous, dark-brown eyes of his again.  
  
  Helena kept silent, and so did he.  
  
  Trying to draw her attention from his powerful presence, she started noticing the surroundings. They were going up a hill, and things began to seem familiar. She had forgotten how beautiful this place was.  
  
  The road was curving around, and she had a great view of the port and Chora with its little white houses built amphitheatrically, overlooking the water. Over to the side, Helena saw a Greek Orthodox Church built on the edge of the hill, dominating the area.  
  
  Something about the Cycladic Islands—a group of thirty-three islands in the Aegean Sea forming a circle around the sacred island of Delos—made people feel as if they were in a dreamland… gorgeous sandy beaches, architecture in white and blue, and narrow roads leading uphill to windmills and beautiful churches which had been standing there for hundreds of years, dominating people and nature.  
  
  Helena always liked Greek Orthodox churches with their Byzantine paintings, their gold and marble decorations, their vitro windows, and the strong smell of incense in the air.  
  
  When she finally saw the house at the top of the hill, she felt restless, and her heart pounded faster. Just as beautiful as she remembered, it stood drowned in red, pink, and white rosebushes, as well as white and yellow jasmine, while a pergola climbed all the way to the second floor windows. She remembered the exquisite aroma of the flowers and couldn’t wait to get closer.  
  
  Dizzied by the roller-coaster of her emotions, she glanced at the man next to her and noticed he was watching her again. The look in his eyes was intense and penetrating, and Helena felt as if it could reach all the way to her soul. She drew a deep breath to calm down and instinctively licked her lips. What is he thinking about? He wasn’t the typical Greek; they usually were so openhearted and friendly.  
  
  She didn’t have time to think of anything else, as they pulled into the driveway that circled in front of the house.  
  
  The front door swung open, and a beautiful young woman with long black hair came outside. She stood at the top of the marble staircase leading to the veranda in front of the house. Helena had the urge to jump out of the car and run into her arms. Instead, she climbed out slowly and hesitated, staring at her aunt for a few seconds. Astonished, she saw her aunt launching down the steps and taking her in her arms. She felt so welcome and happy—like a little girl coming home after a long trip.  
  
  She couldn’t help glancing towards Dimitris. He was staring at her intensely, his gaze burning into her skin…  
  
  She turned back to her aunt. In her crimson red dress and matching sandals, she was more beautiful than she remembered. Her long shiny hair fell in loose, soft waves onto her shoulders, and her skin was tanned. Admiring her aunt, Helena realized for one more time how pale her own skin was.  
  
  Her aunt released her hug and took a step back to take a better look at her. Her sparkling eyes gave away how happy she was to see her.  
  
  “Welcome home, Helena,” she said excited and turned to Dimitris, who was waiting patiently by the car. “Isn’t she beautiful? She looks just like an angel.”  
  
  Helena’s breath caught in her throat as she heard him agreeing with her aunt. She didn’t have time to say anything as her aunt went on. “You look just the way I thought you would. I always knew the cute little girl with the sweet blue eyes and the long blonde braid would turn into a gorgeous young woman.”  
  
  Helena felt her cheeks growing warm, and she spoke quickly so that her aunt wouldn’t have a chance to go on appraising her. “It’s so good to see you again, Aunt Sophie. I’ve missed you so much.”  
  
  “Then why did it take you so long to come back?” the man asked in a low tone of voice, sounding somewhat sarcastic.  
  
  Helena was taken aback by his intervention, and facing him, she gave him a hard look. How dare he get involved in family matters like this?  
  
  Her retort died on her lips when Sophie said, “Dimitris, leave her alone. You know it wasn’t her fault.” Then, smiling warmly, she turned to Helena. “You have to forgive Dimitris. He’s been with us for so long that he gets very protective of the family.”  
  
  Helena couldn’t get over her aggravation. She already felt bad enough for not having contacted Sophie all these years; she didn’t appreciate a stranger interfering in a sensitive matter like this. She wanted to set him straight but decided to leave the matter alone for now.  
  
  Without giving him another look, she followed her aunt into the house. Going through the huge mahogany doors, she shivered, feeling his intense gaze burning into her back…  
  
  Only after she heard the powerful engine coming to life, she realized she was holding her breath. I never even thanked him for picking me up at the port… Never mind. It serves him right for interfering like this…  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  Dimitris drove too fast for the narrow roads of the island. He had to release some tension… Being so close to her after all these years and trying to act totally unaffected were more than he could handle. She had turned out just as amazing as he had imagined. She was breathtaking… and she didn’t remember him…  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  HELENA TRIED TO BANISH Dimitris and his behavior from her mind, beginning to explore the home around her. Her aunt led her into a large living room with huge windows overlooking the sea. The windows were open, and she could smell the jasmine and the salt from the sea breeze in the air—just as she remembered it. She looked around, and everything started coming back to her. Yes, she remembered this lovely room. There were a few new pieces she didn’t recognize, but most of the furniture was still the same.  
  
  Her eyes rested on a painting of her father above the fireplace. Dressed in his white captain’s uniform and wearing his blue and white cap, he was standing on the bridge of a ship, resting one hand on the wooden railing, while holding his pipe to his mouth with the other. White, frothy waves and a snow-white seagull flying with his silver grey wings wide open could be seen in the background of the picture. Helena swallowed hard, as tears welled up in her eyes, looking at the face she adored.  
  
  Her aunt must have read her thoughts, because she came and stood next to her, putting a protective arm around her shoulders. Without thought, Helena burst into tears and cried her heart out. Her aunt just held her and let her release all the pain and sadness built up inside her for so long.  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  When Helena finally raised her head to glance at a carved mirror hanging on the wall, she saw red swollen eyes lingering in her pale face, with her makeup smeared all over it. She didn’t care, though. Actually, she felt much better.  
  
  Her aunt told her to go to the bathroom and wash up. In the meantime, she was going to ring the bell for some tea to be brought to them.  
  
  Helena obediently went to the bathroom down the hallway to wash off. She smiled, realizing she remembered where everything was in the house. It gave her  
a warm feeling of belonging. When she came back to the living room, their tea was already there, and so were the delicious little cupcakes she used to be so fond of.  
  
  Relieved—as if a weight had been lifted off her shoulders—Helena sat there sipping her tea, eating her cupcakes, and talking about the past. It was so healing to be able to talk about her father and not feel guilty, like when she was with her mother.  
  
  Sophie must have loved her brother very much. The pain in her voice when she talked about him was heartbreaking.  
  
  Helena could tell she had so much in common with her aunt. It felt so good to have someone sharing her pain. She noticed, though, Sophie avoided talking about her father’s accident. When Helena brought it up, she shifted uncomfortably and changed the subject. Is it too painful to talk about, or did Sophie share her mother’s suspicions? Helena wondered.  
  
  She watched her aunt closely but decided not to press the matter for now. She was tired and too overwhelmed by emotions to be able to talk about something so painful for both of them.  
  
  They just sat there in silence, holding each other’s hand, lost in their thoughts.  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  Sophie was glad her niece had finally come home. She had missed her so much. She felt as if a part of her beloved brother had come back into her life. She loved Angelos so much and had been devastated by his loss. Sophie hadn’t been the same since then. The pain was unbearable and so were the regrets. Guilty feelings kept her up night after night. Oh, how she wished her mother was alive. She would know exactly what to do. She might even have prevented what happened…  
  
  Sophie looked at Helena, lost in her thoughts. Poor little thing, her life was shattered before it even had a chance to bloom… She sighed. Maybe I should have said something… But how could I, and to whom?  
  
  Sophie was only sixteen years old when Angelos died. Who would pay attention to a young girl’s suspicions? Besides, how could she make any accusations with no proof, based only on things she had heard eavesdropping on her mother’s conversations with Erin? If only I could find the diary. She was sure she would find some answers in there… maybe even evidence of who was really responsible for her brother’s death.  
  
  And what about Thomas? Sophie wondered. She was never close with her adopted brother, who was a lot older than Angelos and her. However, he was the only relative she’d had after Angelos died and Erin took Helena to England. She shuddered as gloomy memories came rushing back…  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  Sophie finally got up. “You must be tired,” she said. “I’ll show you to your room.”  
  
  They walked up the steps, and Helena was delighted to find out she was going to stay in her old room. It made her feel she had really come home, and wasn’t just visiting.  
  
  Her room hadn’t changed much. Her eyes wandered around the spacious bedroom with the pretty white furniture, the four-post bed, the dresser, the little secretarial desk, and the rocking chair by the French doors which lead to the balcony. Everything was there; even some of her stuffed animals were still decorating the room. Overwhelmed, she looked at her aunt.  
  
  Probably guessing what Helena was thinking, Sophie said, “I didn’t want anything changed. I wanted you to find the place just the way you left it when you finally came home.”  
  
  Sweet Sophie, Helena thought. She always knew that sooner or later, I would be coming back.  
  
  When Sophie left her alone, Helena sat on her bed, lost in her thoughts. So many memories… Her eyes rested on the beautiful painting on the wall—a painting her grandmother, Eleana, had painted. She always loved this portrait of a beautiful, little girl, around the age of seven or eight, standing in a blooming garden with an angel in the background, watching over her from Heaven.  
  
  Staring at the painting for the first time through the eyes of an adult, Helena was taken by surprise. She realized how much the girl in the painting resembled her when she was around the same age—the age when she lost her father. Bewildered, she noticed the sadness in the girl’s eyes, and tears came to her own eyes, thinking she probably had the same expression after her father vanished from their lives.  
  
  Helena took a deep breath and let it out slowly, trying to control the turmoil of emotions stirred up inside her by well-buried memories surfacing again.  
  
  She stood up, walked over to the French doors, which were open, and stepped outside. Feeling the fresh breeze on her face, she let her eyes roam over the shimmering blue and gold waters stretching in front of her. She leaned against the black railings with the fancy designs she always remembered and let her thoughts take her back in time…  
  
  She went back to those happy days, when her father was still alive and her mother was a cheerful young woman in love. Her mind filled with cherished memories of the past. She could almost see her parents walking on the beach, holding hands, and herself—as a little child— running all over the place and splashing in the water.  
  
  She could remember the cold winter nights when they would all gather around the stone fireplace to drink hot chocolate and listen to her father telling stories. Her favorite stories were the ones about the voyages of her father and his ancestors. The men of the Sistakis family— like most people on these islands—had spent a big part of their lives at sea.  
  
  It was only after her father met her mother that he gave up travelling and became involved in managing the business. He wanted to be with his wife and daughter, so he would spend most of his time on the island and would only go to the main offices in Piraeus whenever it was absolutely necessary. So many memories, so much love… while at the same time, so much pain…  
  
  Helena didn’t realize she was crying again until teardrops wet the back of her hands, holding on to the railings. She wiped her face with her hands, and turned around to go inside.  
  
  A sudden wave of apprehension washed over her, and she stopped dead in her tracks… she felt like someone was watching her. Cautiously, she scanned her surroundings but didn’t see anyone. She glanced down at the garden and all the way to the edge of the cliff. There was nobody there. However, she could still feel it. She checked around her from side to side, and then she saw him.  
  
  It was Dimitris. He was on one of the balconies on the bottom floor farther to her right, wearing tight fitting jeans and a white shirt open low on his chest. Leaning against the railings, he looked just like a mysterious, seductive pirate on the bridge of his ship.  
  
  Helena’s breath caught in her throat. He was irresistibly handsome… and he was watching her intensely. To her surprise, he didn’t even turn his head to pretend he hadn’t seen her. He was just standing there, boldly watching her.  
  
  Helena felt her temper rising. Going back inside her bedroom, she slammed the doors shut. It was going to be hot in the room with no air-conditioning, but she didn’t care at this point. She couldn’t believe he was in the house. Who is that man?  
  
  The balcony he was on led to one of the bedrooms downstairs. What on earth is he doing there? She was going to have a talk with her aunt and put a stop to this man’s arrogant actions. She was sure Sophie wasn’t aware of him wandering around the house like that.  
  
  Trying to put Dimitris out of her mind for now, she walked into her en-suite bathroom. Everything was the same in there, too. Glancing at the big marble bathtub, she had the urge to sink in it. Without a second thought, she turned the water on and took off her clothes. Sinking into the warm water, the fragrance of roses surrounded her. She lay back, closing her eyes, and felt content and relaxed…  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  It was a lot later before she opened her eyes again. She looked around, startled. She was sure she’d been there for too long and was going to be late for dinner. She rushed out of the bathtub, grabbed a towel, and went to her bedroom to check her watch. It was almost eight o’clock. She vigorously dried herself and blow-dried her hair. Then she put something on in a hurry and rushed downstairs.  
  
  The dining room was empty, so she made her way to the living room. Sophie was sitting by the window, sipping some wine. Lovelier than ever, she was wearing a  
champagne dress and had her hair pulled back in a white ribbon. She looked up as Helena walked inside.  
  
  Helena was about to apologize for been late but was interrupted by a cynical voice, “It was nice of you to finally show up.”  
  
  She turned around to face Dimitris. Before she could open her mouth, Sophie stood up and stared at him, disapprovingly. “Dimitris, you have to stop treating Helena like this. It wasn’t her fault, and she was hurt as much as the rest of us… maybe more. So don’t be so harsh on her.”  
  
  He seemed as if he was about to say something, but finally remained silent.  
  
  Sophie came and took Helena’s hand. “Let’s go eat, sweetie. I know you must be starving.”  
  
  Helena let Sophie lead her out of the living room without a backwards glance. They walked into the dining room, with Dimitris following right behind them. As soon as the women sat down, Dimitris went and sat at the head of the table.  
  
  Helena was shocked! This was too much. This man aggravated her, and the fact he was going to stay for dinner made things even worse. Who does he think he is, sitting in my father’s place at the head of the table?  
  
  She tried to be as polite as possible for Sophie's sake. It was obvious Sophie liked Dimitris, and she seemed so excited to have him and Helena there.  
  
  Dimitris, on the other hand, could be very charming if he wanted to. He kept on talking to Sophie, totally ignoring Helena. It was Sophie who drew Helena into the conversation several times, and every time, Dimitris would shut her out.  
  
  Helena was furious with his arrogant behavior. However, she was even more furious with herself and her conflicting emotions. What was wrong with her? She wanted to get up and run as far away from him as she could, while at the same time, she was drawn to him like a moth to a flame.  
  
  She couldn’t help but secretly admire his flawless profile and that perfect, hard to resist body of his. His mere presence set her emotions on fire, and she couldn’t think straight.",1,1757523684.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1ndjty3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ndjty3/a_night_in_mcdougal/,A Night in McDougal,"My name is Damien, and I have been surviving in the town of McDougal ever since it vanished on the evening of April 28th, 2018. I live in a small isolated house in the middle of the surrounding woods, about half a mile outside of town proper with my friend Sam. I say vanished because to the rest of the world, I’m sure that’s precisely what happened. From what I’ve been told by those arriving after the fact, that’s the day that McDougal completely vanished from the map, or at least its people did. Supposedly, all of the buildings, cars, even food that was being eaten that day all remained. 

For us, it was more of the rest of the world simply vanishing. Granted, we could only go as far as our cars could take us, but every town we came across, every city, every state was abandoned. Even massive metropolises known for housing millions of people were void of human life. To us, it wasn’t McDougal that had disappeared, it was the rest of the population, leaving only our small town of 2,000 people as the last bastion of humanity in an empty world. 

Before anyone asks, no, I’m not here to tell you what happened. I’m not going to tell you what we discovered on our expeditions outside of town, I’m not here to tell you why this happened to our isolated community (not that I even could), and I’m not here to offer an explanation as to why you had the misfortune to wind up here. Honestly, I try not to think about that stuff. Maybe if there’s enough interest, Sam can talk to you about that in a follow up post, or in the comments. My purpose today with this post is simpler, more fundamental. 

Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of new faces in town, the few times I’ve actually bothered to head down there. There was a time that wasn’t always the case, and it was only ever those that were initially pulled in after the entire town I call home seemed to become isolated. But over the past few months, we’ve been getting a slew of amateur podcasters, self labeled urban explorers, so called “paranormal investigators”, even the odd military man suddenly arriving overnight in town. They always say the same thing, that they fell asleep within the walls that used to house the residents of McDougal, and then they wake up here, with us. Most of them don’t last a week, some don’t even last their first day. 

So at Sam’s behest, I’m offering this post as a basic guideline. I’ll run you through what the average night looks like for him and I so you can model that routine and not wind up as another victim. Personally I don’t care if you heed my warnings or not, but Sam is adamant that we have some sort of duty to keep newcomers safe. So if for no other reason, just pay attention for Sam’s sake. The following took place last night, and is a good, all encompassing example of what you can expect now that you’re stuck here with us. 

At four hours until midnight, darkness begins to loom over the trees surrounding our small home in the woods. Before night fully falls, Sam and I work together to inspect the house’s entrances. Front door, side porch, windows, everything. We ensure that the wooden boards we use to block them off are secured, that it’s impossible for anyone or anything to get in. Some days we discover that the boards are shattered, or forcefully pulled away from the house, and we replace them. Once we’re just about done, I leave him to finish up and perform one last check on our surroundings, make sure I don’t see anything moving in the veil of brown and green surrounding us. 

During the daylight hours, the woods serve a number of purposes, such as isolation from people I don’t wish to deal with, natural cover from any new threats, and as a source of small game in the form of squirrels and rabbits, even the odd deer if I’m lucky. At night, however, they serve as a place for panicking people to get lost, and as cover for the Repeaters. 

If you don’t know what those are, look at the name and think for a second. You know those people around town who have the same conversations with clearly different peopke, knock on doors to abandoned buildings and go inside, or those who walk the exact same way for the exact same amount of time? Notice how they do those things day after day, with no alteration? Yeah, those are Repeaters, and they’re more dangerous than you think. We don’t get many out this way, but there are more than a few who are trapped in the cycle of hopelessly wandering the woods. So, we keep an eye out.

At three hours to midnight, we get inside the house and lock the front door, light some lanterns and candles for light, and make sure anything that we could step on or stumble over is out of the way. Next we check to make sure there’s nothing causing any noticeably audible noise that can be heard from outside. Sometimes that means one of us going back out and listening while the other checks an appliance, especially if it’s something new. We have to be thorough, after all. If our dishwasher or laundry is running, we stop it. 

One thing you need to learn quick is that anything is better than breaking a Repeater’s pattern. Soggy clothes, missing shoes, a bruised elbow, anything. I don’t care how much you hate leaving something unfinished or how much you need the air conditioning going to be able to sleep. If using an object or completing a task would interrupt a Repeater, LEAVE IT. It’s not worth your life. 

At two hours to midnight, we do a weapons check. Dissemble our guns, make sure they’re clean and in working order. We check how much ammo we have, make sure we have the right ammo. For us, that’s 30.06 for our Winchester 70, and .45 ACP for our 1911. Technically you don’t need bullets with that much stopping power, anything that can drop a human target reliably will suit you just fine. But be warned, the Repeaters can take a lot of damage, way more than you would think or expect. So stopping power helps a lot, buys you time. 

We also keep at least one close quarters weapon on us, usually something that stabs or bashes. For me, that equates to a ten inch hunting knife my father gave me for my eighteenth birthday. If you’re like Sam, that means a baseball bat, something powerful enough to stop something coming at you, but not lethal enough to kill it in one hit. Usually. You don’t need those exact items, anything that works against closing in threats is perfectly adequate. Ideally, you don’t want anything getting that close to you, that’s what the guns are for. But it’s better to have and not need than to need and not have, as the saying goes. 

At one hour to midnight, we figure out who’s staying up on watch. We get our plan together, make sure we’re both on the same page. Last night’s conversation went something like this;

“I can keep watch tonight. You’ve been staying up the past three nights now, it’s not good for you, man.” Sam said as he sat opposite to me at the small circular kitchen table. He fidgeted with this fingers, a kind expression written across his face as he leaned forward. 

“I’m fine. I don’t mind sleeping during the day.” I rebutted, ignoring his silent pressuring. 

“We could always switch to shifts, like I recommended.” I knew his offer was sincere, but I didn’t like the idea of trying to set that up in just one hour. 

“No. Too risky.” Sam sighed and rubbed his forehead, clearly exasperated with me. 

“It’s not like we’d be screaming at each other, Damien. Just shaking the other awake, making sure they’re good and-“

“I said no.” 

“Damien.” Sam’s voice sounded noticeably worried, despite his efforts to hide it. 

“Sam, I’m fine. What we’re doing works, and we don’t have time to change it. We can talk about in the morning if it bothers you.” 

“Which it does.” He said somewhat sternly. 

“Then think of a good argument for it, maybe you’ll change my mind. Good night Sam.” I think he realized that I wasn’t budging on this one, not tonight. Without a word he pulled the 1911 from behind his pants and set it on the table in front of me. 

“At least hold onto this,then.” I stared at the wooden handle of the pistol for a moment, the recently cleaned iron shimmering in the candlelight.

“What if you need it? I already have the rifle.” I argued, pulling it up from under the table and setting it in front of me. Sam shook his head. 

“If we’re not doing shifts, there’s no point in me having it. The people out there are getting worse and I’m worried…” I noticed his voice catch in his throat, and he seemed to fight something back. He always worried too much, poor Sam. A pang of sadness ran through me as he cleared his throat before continuing. 

“I’m worried there’s gonna be more than you can take with a bolt action. You need to be able to handle them fast if worse comes to worse. So please, take it. I’ll hear you if you fire anyway.” I wanted to argue more, point out that if rifle fire did wake him up, he would easily be able to rush to my defense and use the gun if he still had it on him. Besides, for all his talk of wanting me safe, I wanted him safe too. There was, after all, a window in the bedroom. Boarded up, secured, maybe, but there was a good chance it wouldn’t stay that way. 

Still, this was clearly important to him, and more pressingly, we were short on time. So I relented, sighing as I took the strap on the rifle and slung it over my shoulder. 

“Safety’s on.” Sam reminded me as I took hold of the pistol and slipped it neatly into the back of my trousers. I nodded at him, and saw a faint smile of relief cross his face as he sat back, the candlelight only just barely revealing his short blonde hair and green eyes. There was a silent thank you in his expression, one that I’m sure was supposed to make me feel better. 

All it did was make me seriously consider shifts after all. 

Midnight. Sam was asleep, or at least he better have been. I’d given him my room for the night, as I sat on the couch that normally served as his sleeping spot. The room was bathed in the soft candlelight from the center of the old coffee table. In the light I could see the outlines of our old television, some old photos depicting either Sam’s family or mine, the old recliner I’d sit in when we we’d watch TV in the odd case we had a lazy day, and of course, the front door, locked and secure. 

Anything beyond that was only vague shapes. The candlelight was just bright enough to reveal their presence, but did not extend deep enough into the darkness to expose their details. A large circular disc denoted the kitchen table, and a few rectangular blocks were the only indication I had of our refrigerator, cupboards, dishwasher, and sink. That is to say nothing of the small gap behind me, leading to a small hallway that, though I knew led to the bathroom, laundry room, and bedroom, appeared to be nothing more than a deep wall of blackness. The thick dark caused my chest to feel heavier as I observed it, and I felt my grip on the rifle tighten. 

I did my best to keep my mind from wandering or succumbing to fear, instead keeping close attention to any noise I heard around the house, and outside. Every so often I would look at the watch given to me by mother before I left home, noting the time so I’d be ready for each event. 

12:52 AM was when things truly started. While we had mostly boarded up the window overlooking our front yard, there were still small slits between the boards of wood that we could use to peek out if necessary. Unfortunately, this also meant things from outside could look in once they got close enough.

We kept our windows ever so slightly open at night. If you don’t have any major activity by your home, you obviously don’t need to do this, as it is a risky, oftentimes unnecessary gamble in the event you, or something in your shelter makes noise. For Sam and I, however, it was the only way we could hear the approaching footsteps and of our first visitor. 

Upon hearing the telltale signs of crackling twigs and old leaves, I moved away from the couch, stepping slowly to the side of the window as I clutched my rifle close to my chest. 

One thud, two thuds, three thuds. My heart began racing, and I forced myself to hold my breath. For a moment there was nothing, as whatever made the sounds outside my home silently peered inside. A deep groan filled the air as I took another cautious step away from the window. Out of the blackness, in flickering light, I saw burly looking fingers curl around one of the planks of wood, as the first Repeater lifted a long dead flashlight to my window. 

“Hello? Is anyone in there, I need a little help.” The man’s voice wasn’t threatening in the slightest, if anything it was slightly pitiable. There was a shakiness to it, a tiredness, like he was trying to catch his breath. I said nothing, no one had been here the night he arrived looking for help, and so no one could be tonight either. 

Knock. Knock. Knock as the man gave three soft pounds against the wood. The man peered closer to the window. I could just see his shape leering close to the window, using the free hand to hold over his eyes, lifting the dead flashlight higher through one of the cracks. No doubt he saw the candle, which of course hadn’t been there the first night either. Thankfully, that deviation was so small it meant next to nothing. 

“Hello?” Asked the man again. I kept still, my finger twitching as I fought to keep it off the trigger. One minute, two minutes, three minutes passed as the lifeless flashlight passed over and over across the window. 

“Please, I’m lost, I just need some help.” The man’s voice was soft, pleading. I did not respond, I could not respond. It may seem heartless, but he was too far gone. After a minute more, the Repeater gave up with a defeated sigh, and loudly began to stomp away from the window. I didn’t immediately return to my spot on the couch, instead waiting a few more minutes until I could no longer hear his stomping, or his defeated gasps of breath as he left. After I was satisfied, I let out the breath I was holding and sat back down, trying to force my chest to stop pounding through deep, calculated breaths. 

The next few hours were calm, save for the odd scratching and whispers asking if anyone was inside from the few people who’d found us from time to time. These Repeaters, thankfully, had not peered through the window as the first had. So, I needed only to keep my rifle at the ready, just in case something set them off. Another valuable lesson, if a Repeater has no reason to see you, don’t give it one. Stay out of its sight, don’t make a sound, don’t interrupt its routine. They’ll leave you alone. Usually. 

3:52 AM, the night was almost over, and I had only one visitor left. This last Repeater was technically our first, one we had encountered in the first few days our town became isolated. A lot of people broke down in those initial days, and most of us were too frightened and, frankly, too busy panicking  to focus on the Repeater problem. That led to a lot more of them, including the one I now had to face, the one I had to turn away. 

Taking a deep breath, I sat up from the couch and made my way to the door, checking the bolt of my rifle one last time. I was only slightly relieved to see the brass casing reflecting a soft bit of candlelight back at me. With any luck, no ammo would be spent tonight. 

If you must deal with a Repeater, try to learn exactly what their routine is, and mimic it to the best of your ability. Think of it as an acting exercise, try not to mess up, and be ready. 

Carefully stepping by the front door, I checked by the nightstand beside for the flashlight I kept there. Sure enough, there was a bright red, chunky plastic flashlight I used specially for events like tonight. Steeling myself, I slung the rifle behind my shoulder, just out of sight, and took the small twisting metal on the door knob in my hand. After a soft twist, I heard the barely discernible clicking of metal as the door unlocked. 

“Stay calm. You know what to say, what to do.” I said aloud to myself. Swinging the door open, I gently stepped outside into the cool night air, chirping crickets and cicadas quickly filling my ears as I took in the near pitch blackness of the treeline underneath the starless, cloudy night sky. I counted the seconds as I gripped the strap on my rifle tightly. 

One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six seconds. The first signs, deep breathing, panting, the cracking of leaves and snapping branches. 

“Hello! Anyone!” Came a distraught voice from the woods. Even all these years later, the pain in his voice was unmistakable. 

“Can anybody hear me?! Please, it’s my daughter!” He begged, I could see the tears on his face even before he came visible. My turn. 

“Hello? Who’s out there?” I asked, pitching my voice ever so slightly higher. The truth is, it was Sam who had been out here all those nights ago. Unable to sleep, trying desperately to reach his mom on his phone. In the distance, I saw a man stumble out of the woods and fall onto his hands and knees, huffing as he laid on the rocky road leading to the house. He was still too far away to see any features, but I could hear him panting, his breaths raspy as he desperately sucked in air. 

“Sir? Sir are you okay?” I asked with false concern. The frame of the man turned, still huffing as he stumbled up. The shuffling of rocks signified him getting closer, and I fought the urge to ready my rifle as my focus deepened, ready for anything. 

“Please, please you have to help me, it’s my daughter! One of those things got her!” He exclaimed as he stepped closer. I had no idea what the man looked like as he stopped a few feet from the steps leading up to our porch. There was only enough light from the clouded sky to reveal his shape, huffing, puffing, wheezing. 

“Those things? You mean the Repeaters?” I asked in Sam’s voice. The figure nodded frantically. 

“Yes, she got in their way and they took her into the woods! I need help, please I need to find her!” He begged. I pretended to acquiesce.

“I-I’ll go get some help, just stay there!” Without another word, I walked back to the door while keeping an eye on the figure, calmly opened it, and stepped inside. Technically, this was a deviation. Sam had been somewhat frantic that night, nearly throwing open the door as he rushed inside. His clattering had been what woke me up that night, sounds I most certainly hadn’t been making. These types of deviation are fine, so long as they don’t interrupt the Repeater, or drastically alter the events they’re trapped in. So, I grabbed the flashlight by the door, then proceeded to wait several minutes. 

I kept a close eye on the Repeater through a small peep hole as time crawled ever so slowly. Even though I was playing my part, there was no guarantee that everything around me would play out exactly the same. We were in the middle of the woods, surrounded on all sides by wild life, wild life that by its very nature was unpredictable. It’s best to keep an eye out when you have such a massive variable, one you can never fully account for. The Repeater, for his part, never deviated, following the same pattern I’d seen for years now. Exhausted huffing, placing his hands on his head and pacing as he waited outside, holding his arm periodically. 

4:01 AM, I could feel my stomach drop. Forcing myself to take a deep breath, I slung the rifle so I held it in one hand, tucked the flashlight under my arm with the other, then opened the door. I quickly shifted the flaslight to my open hand and flicked it on as I stepped outside, focusing on the Repeater. 

The Repeater, just like always, winced at the sudden light and turned to face me, holding out a dirt covered, scarred hand as he backed away slightly. His thin autumn coat was torn, ripped in several places and revealing hints of a long sleeved t-shirt. His grass stained jeans fared no better, small holes revealing scabbed skin in some places, and fresh cuts in others. Even all this time later, I pitied the man. When I’d first encountered him, his clothing had looked almost brand new, but years of reliving the worst day of his life had left them just as broken as he was. 

“Just focus… You’re almost done.” I told myself. 

“You, what did you say to my friend? Why are you even here?” I asked harshly, using my own voice this time. Like everyone else, I’d been confused and scared at the time, and on that particular night, had just experienced a sudden and unwanted awakening. If I could take back what I said, what I did, believe me, I would. Instead, I watched for the thousandth time as the man blinked rapidly, squinting as he fought against the light. His voice shook when he tried to respond. 

“I-I was just asking for help, I swear! My daughter, she was taken, I’m trying to-“ 

“At this time of night? What’s wrong with you?! You’re gonna get yourself and probably us killed!” I yelled, interrupting the man. I hated the venom in my voice, I hated the startled yelp the man let out as he raised his hands in a non-threatening gesture, pieces of fabric dangling from his arms. Most of all I hated what I’d missed all those nights ago, the sight of the man crying, barely holding it together. 

“Please, I just want-“ He tried to say, his voice trembling. Again I interrupted him. 

“I don’t care what you want, you need to leave, now.” The Repeater’s expression dropped, shaking his head in sheer disbelief and despair as he opened his mouth to speak again. 

CRASH. My heart leapt up into my throat. 

“No, no no no no…” I thought. In an instant I turned to my left, shining the beam of light towards the small gravel driveway that housed my car and our trashcans. In the light I could see both trash cans, both of which should have been standing. Instead, I could see one of them tipped over, trash spilling on the ground as a raccoon obliviously picked away at the escaping pile. My grip around the rifle tightened, and I could feel my flashlight hand begin to shiver. 

“Crap…” I thought. A deviation, and a big one. Turning back to the Repeater, I could see his expression and demeanor change in an instant. His fear, his despair, his pitiable stance were all gone. In their place I saw a hardened, almost animalistic rage in his eyes, fists clenching so tightly that I could see fresh blood dripping from where his long dirtied nails dug into his skin. His attention was divided between myself and the offending raccoon, his huffing breath turning into a heaving growl as the white in his eyes turned red. 

“Crap…” I said aloud. My mind went a mile a minute as I tried forcing myself to calm down, taking deep breaths and steadying my hands. 

“I said you need to leave, NOW.” I said in a shaking voice, trying desperately to get the Repeater to recognize his routine. The Repeater only growled louder, veins beginning to become visible in his hands and in his face. 

Without thinking I dropped the flashlight and heard it clattering to the ground as I raised my rifle, aiming at the Repeater as it became half bathed in light, half shrouded by darkness. 

“Don’t make me shoot you!” I shouted, my voice trembling as I trained my scope on the Repeater’s chest. I regretted the words as soon as I said them. This was another massive deviation. As poorly as I handled the situation years ago, I’d never threatened to shoot the man. Any chance I had now of keeping this from escalating was gone. The Repeater grit his teeth as he hissed in reply, his eyes becoming almost completely red as blood freely poured from his hands. 

Suddenly, the man roared, pouncing from a dead stop as he lept forward, screaming as he charged me at full sprint. 

“CRAP!” I yelled in a panic. 

CRACK, followed immediately by an ear shattering BANG. The shot had been both a reflex, and intentional all at once as it echoed across the formerly silent woods. Quick, easy, without thought. That’s the only way to deal with one attacking you, no mercy, no thought as to who they are or were, just rapid and decisive force. 

The shot hit the charging Repeater in the chest, the force of the round twisting his body as he stumbled and slammed into the ground. I quickly cycled the bolt, the sound of the empty brass casing hitting the wooden porch almost completely drowned out as the Repeater screamed in fury, fumbling with its hands to push itself back up. The monster rose his gaze to meet mine, its eyes practically dripping with fury as it roared, spit and blood flying from its lips as it tried to push towards me. 

A second CRACK and BANG left my ears ringing, and my head felt like it was almost splitting open from a sudden headache, a painful reminder that I’d forgotten to wear any form of ear protection. In the moment I hardly cared about that, however. My attention was focused on the man I’d just killed. His head was a mere fraction of what it was, now shattered and split partly open. Shards of his bloody skull were visible in the beam of the flashlight, and I found myself feeling sick to my stomach. 

Even knowing what he was, I felt a twinge of guilt welling up in my stomach as a wave of exhaustion swept over me. This was twice now I had killed him, I realized. Thoughts of him somehow getting better and returning to himself flooded my mind for an instant before falling away, replaced by the sight of his lifeless body. 

“I… I’m sorry…” Was all I could say as I lowered the rifle, my hearing slowly retuning to me as I took a step back. 

“Damien?! Damien what happened, are you alright?!” I heard the panicked voice of my friend shout. 

“I’m fine, Sam. I’m fine.” I lied as I cycled the bolt a second time, letting the expended round fall to the ground outside before stepping back inside, my eyes never leaving the body in front of me. Even as I closed the door, I could hear the distant sound of two more screams somewhere in the woods, more Repeaters, more people who’d gotten lost in the woods. More people who’d lost hope.

Sam and I didn’t sleep the rest of that night. Occasionally, we’d hear a rabid Repeater slamming against our windows or our door as they screamed, held our breath as they tried bashing their way in. Morning came before they could make progress, and, for whatever reason, they fell back into their routines. 

I’ll let that be the last lesson, before signing off and leaving you with this post. If you have the ability to, hunker down and hide from the Repeaters if you suspect they’ll come after you. You won’t be able to outrun them. If there’s enough of them, and believe me, make enough noise and there will be, you won’t be able to out fight them. Just hide. Hide, and pray they don’t find you. Try to fix whatever damage they do when it’s safe, then get ready to deal with them again. 

 If you have any other questions, leave them here, I guess. I’m sure Sam or myself with get to them at some point. 

Above all, stay safe, try not to give up. We don’t need more of them around here. ",2,1757523537.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1ndjsvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/1ndjsvu/i_need_friendsssssss/,I need friendsssssss,"Hey guys,

I’m 24F and desperately in need of some fun friends to go out and do things with. I’d love someone to grab drinks with, check out a jazz or live music club, do pottery/painting, hit up museums, go café hopping, or even try rock climbing or window shopping (my fav activity btw, they don’t pay grads enough money these days 😂). Honestly, I’m down to try whatever you suggest too.

About me: I just graduated last year and work full-time in architecture, I go to gym 5 days a week and drink coffee twice a day if that matters ( I actually hate it but I need to stay in shape so don’t ask me to go to gym with you lol but I’ll always say yes to coffee), also do pilate and rock climbing every now and then (but I’m so bad at them), I go out for drinks on almost every Friday either alone or with my company. I do have work and uni friends, but I can’t really drag them along for the random fun stuff I want to do. I don’t care if you’re male, female, or anywhere in between, as long as you’re not a creep, we’ll get along just fine.

Shy? No worries. You don’t even have to talk to me at first until you feel comfortable. Bonus points if you’re around my age and have a dark sense of humor.

1ndjslz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ndjslz/a_night_in_mcdougal/,A Night in McDougal,"My name is Damien, and I have been surviving in the town of McDougal ever since it vanished on the evening of April 28th, 2018. I live in a small isolated house in the middle of the surrounding woods, about half a mile outside of town proper with my friend Sam. I say vanished because to the rest of the world, I’m sure that’s precisely what happened. From what I’ve been told by those arriving after the fact, that’s the day that McDougal completely vanished from the map, or at least its people did. Supposedly, all of the buildings, cars, even food that was being eaten that day all remained. 

For us, it was more of the rest of the world simply vanishing. Granted, we could only go as far as our cars could take us, but every town we came across, every city, every state was abandoned. Even massive metropolises known for housing millions of people were void of human life. To us, it wasn’t McDougal that had disappeared, it was the rest of the population, leaving only our small town of 2,000 people as the last bastion of humanity in an empty world. 

Before anyone asks, no, I’m not here to tell you what happened. I’m not going to tell you what we discovered on our expeditions outside of town, I’m not here to tell you why this happened to our isolated community (not that I even could), and I’m not here to offer an explanation as to why you had the misfortune to wind up here. Honestly, I try not to think about that stuff. Maybe if there’s enough interest, Sam can talk to you about that in a follow up post, or in the comments. My purpose today with this post is simpler, more fundamental. 

Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of new faces in town, the few times I’ve actually bothered to head down there. There was a time that wasn’t always the case, and it was only ever those that were initially pulled in after the entire town I call home seemed to become isolated. But over the past few months, we’ve been getting a slew of amateur podcasters, self labeled urban explorers, so called “paranormal investigators”, even the odd military man suddenly arriving overnight in town. They always say the same thing, that they fell asleep within the walls that used to house the residents of McDougal, and then they wake up here, with us. Most of them don’t last a week, some don’t even last their first day. 

So at Sam’s behest, I’m offering this post as a basic guideline. I’ll run you through what the average night looks like for him and I so you can model that routine and not wind up as another victim. Personally I don’t care if you heed my warnings or not, but Sam is adamant that we have some sort of duty to keep newcomers safe. So if for no other reason, just pay attention for Sam’s sake. The following took place last night, and is a good, all encompassing example of what you can expect now that you’re stuck here with us. 

At four hours until midnight, darkness begins to loom over the trees surrounding our small home in the woods. Before night fully falls, Sam and I work together to inspect the house’s entrances. Front door, side porch, windows, everything. We ensure that the wooden boards we use to block them off are secured, that it’s impossible for anyone or anything to get in. Some days we discover that the boards are shattered, or forcefully pulled away from the house, and we replace them. Once we’re just about done, I leave him to finish up and perform one last check on our surroundings, make sure I don’t see anything moving in the veil of brown and green surrounding us. 

During the daylight hours, the woods serve a number of purposes, such as isolation from people I don’t wish to deal with, natural cover from any new threats, and as a source of small game in the form of squirrels and rabbits, even the odd deer if I’m lucky. At night, however, they serve as a place for panicking people to get lost, and as cover for the Repeaters. 

If you don’t know what those are, look at the name and think for a second. You know those people around town who have the same conversations with clearly different peopke, knock on doors to abandoned buildings and go inside, or those who walk the exact same way for the exact same amount of time? Notice how they do those things day after day, with no alteration? Yeah, those are Repeaters, and they’re more dangerous than you think. We don’t get many out this way, but there are more than a few who are trapped in the cycle of hopelessly wandering the woods. So, we keep an eye out.

At three hours to midnight, we get inside the house and lock the front door, light some lanterns and candles for light, and make sure anything that we could step on or stumble over is out of the way. Next we check to make sure there’s nothing causing any noticeably audible noise that can be heard from outside. Sometimes that means one of us going back out and listening while the other checks an appliance, especially if it’s something new. We have to be thorough, after all. If our dishwasher or laundry is running, we stop it. 

One thing you need to learn quick is that anything is better than breaking a Repeater’s pattern. Soggy clothes, missing shoes, a bruised elbow, anything. I don’t care how much you hate leaving something unfinished or how much you need the air conditioning going to be able to sleep. If using an object or completing a task would interrupt a Repeater, LEAVE IT. It’s not worth your life. 

At two hours to midnight, we do a weapons check. Dissemble our guns, make sure they’re clean and in working order. We check how much ammo we have, make sure we have the right ammo. For us, that’s 30.06 for our Winchester 70, and .45 ACP for our 1911. Technically you don’t need bullets with that much stopping power, anything that can drop a human target reliably will suit you just fine. But be warned, the Repeaters can take a lot of damage, way more than you would think or expect. So stopping power helps a lot, buys you time. 

We also keep at least one close quarters weapon on us, usually something that stabs or bashes. For me, that equates to a ten inch hunting knife my father gave me for my eighteenth birthday. If you’re like Sam, that means a baseball bat, something powerful enough to stop something coming at you, but not lethal enough to kill it in one hit. Usually. You don’t need those exact items, anything that works against closing in threats is perfectly adequate. Ideally, you don’t want anything getting that close to you, that’s what the guns are for. But it’s better to have and not need than to need and not have, as the saying goes. 

At one hour to midnight, we figure out who’s staying up on watch. We get our plan together, make sure we’re both on the same page. Last night’s conversation went something like this;

“I can keep watch tonight. You’ve been staying up the past three nights now, it’s not good for you, man.” Sam said as he sat opposite to me at the small circular kitchen table. He fidgeted with this fingers, a kind expression written across his face as he leaned forward. 

“I’m fine. I don’t mind sleeping during the day.” I rebutted, ignoring his silent pressuring. 

“We could always switch to shifts, like I recommended.” I knew his offer was sincere, but I didn’t like the idea of trying to set that up in just one hour. 

“No. Too risky.” Sam sighed and rubbed his forehead, clearly exasperated with me. 

“It’s not like we’d be screaming at each other, Damien. Just shaking the other awake, making sure they’re good and-“

“I said no.” 

“Damien.” Sam’s voice sounded noticeably worried, despite his efforts to hide it. 

“Sam, I’m fine. What we’re doing works, and we don’t have time to change it. We can talk about in the morning if it bothers you.” 

“Which it does.” He said somewhat sternly. 

“Then think of a good argument for it, maybe you’ll change my mind. Good night Sam.” I think he realized that I wasn’t budging on this one, not tonight. Without a word he pulled the 1911 from behind his pants and set it on the table in front of me. 

“At least hold onto this,then.” I stared at the wooden handle of the pistol for a moment, the recently cleaned iron shimmering in the candlelight.

“What if you need it? I already have the rifle.” I argued, pulling it up from under the table and setting it in front of me. Sam shook his head. 

“If we’re not doing shifts, there’s no point in me having it. The people out there are getting worse and I’m worried…” I noticed his voice catch in his throat, and he seemed to fight something back. He always worried too much, poor Sam. A pang of sadness ran through me as he cleared his throat before continuing. 

“I’m worried there’s gonna be more than you can take with a bolt action. You need to be able to handle them fast if worse comes to worse. So please, take it. I’ll hear you if you fire anyway.” I wanted to argue more, point out that if rifle fire did wake him up, he would easily be able to rush to my defense and use the gun if he still had it on him. Besides, for all his talk of wanting me safe, I wanted him safe too. There was, after all, a window in the bedroom. Boarded up, secured, maybe, but there was a good chance it wouldn’t stay that way. 

Still, this was clearly important to him, and more pressingly, we were short on time. So I relented, sighing as I took the strap on the rifle and slung it over my shoulder. 

“Safety’s on.” Sam reminded me as I took hold of the pistol and slipped it neatly into the back of my trousers. I nodded at him, and saw a faint smile of relief cross his face as he sat back, the candlelight only just barely revealing his short blonde hair and green eyes. There was a silent thank you in his expression, one that I’m sure was supposed to make me feel better. 

All it did was make me seriously consider shifts after all. 

Midnight. Sam was asleep, or at least he better have been. I’d given him my room for the night, as I sat on the couch that normally served as his sleeping spot. The room was bathed in the soft candlelight from the center of the old coffee table. In the light I could see the outlines of our old television, some old photos depicting either Sam’s family or mine, the old recliner I’d sit in when we we’d watch TV in the odd case we had a lazy day, and of course, the front door, locked and secure. 

Anything beyond that was only vague shapes. The candlelight was just bright enough to reveal their presence, but did not extend deep enough into the darkness to expose their details. A large circular disc denoted the kitchen table, and a few rectangular blocks were the only indication I had of our refrigerator, cupboards, dishwasher, and sink. That is to say nothing of the small gap behind me, leading to a small hallway that, though I knew led to the bathroom, laundry room, and bedroom, appeared to be nothing more than a deep wall of blackness. The thick dark caused my chest to feel heavier as I observed it, and I felt my grip on the rifle tighten. 

I did my best to keep my mind from wandering or succumbing to fear, instead keeping close attention to any noise I heard around the house, and outside. Every so often I would look at the watch given to me by mother before I left home, noting the time so I’d be ready for each event. 

12:52 AM was when things truly started. While we had mostly boarded up the window overlooking our front yard, there were still small slits between the boards of wood that we could use to peek out if necessary. Unfortunately, this also meant things from outside could look in once they got close enough.

We kept our windows ever so slightly open at night. If you don’t have any major activity by your home, you obviously don’t need to do this, as it is a risky, oftentimes unnecessary gamble in the event you, or something in your shelter makes noise. For Sam and I, however, it was the only way we could hear the approaching footsteps and of our first visitor. 

Upon hearing the telltale signs of crackling twigs and old leaves, I moved away from the couch, stepping slowly to the side of the window as I clutched my rifle close to my chest. 

One thud, two thuds, three thuds. My heart began racing, and I forced myself to hold my breath. For a moment there was nothing, as whatever made the sounds outside my home silently peered inside. A deep groan filled the air as I took another cautious step away from the window. Out of the blackness, in flickering light, I saw burly looking fingers curl around one of the planks of wood, as the first Repeater lifted a long dead flashlight to my window. 

“Hello? Is anyone in there, I need a little help.” The man’s voice wasn’t threatening in the slightest, if anything it was slightly pitiable. There was a shakiness to it, a tiredness, like he was trying to catch his breath. I said nothing, no one had been here the night he arrived looking for help, and so no one could be tonight either. 

Knock. Knock. Knock as the man gave three soft pounds against the wood. The man peered closer to the window. I could just see his shape leering close to the window, using the free hand to hold over his eyes, lifting the dead flashlight higher through one of the cracks. No doubt he saw the candle, which of course hadn’t been there the first night either. Thankfully, that deviation was so small it meant next to nothing. 

“Hello?” Asked the man again. I kept still, my finger twitching as I fought to keep it off the trigger. One minute, two minutes, three minutes passed as the lifeless flashlight passed over and over across the window. 

“Please, I’m lost, I just need some help.” The man’s voice was soft, pleading. I did not respond, I could not respond. It may seem heartless, but he was too far gone. After a minute more, the Repeater gave up with a defeated sigh, and loudly began to stomp away from the window. I didn’t immediately return to my spot on the couch, instead waiting a few more minutes until I could no longer hear his stomping, or his defeated gasps of breath as he left. After I was satisfied, I let out the breath I was holding and sat back down, trying to force my chest to stop pounding through deep, calculated breaths. 

The next few hours were calm, save for the odd scratching and whispers asking if anyone was inside from the few people who’d found us from time to time. These Repeaters, thankfully, had not peered through the window as the first had. So, I needed only to keep my rifle at the ready, just in case something set them off. Another valuable lesson, if a Repeater has no reason to see you, don’t give it one. Stay out of its sight, don’t make a sound, don’t interrupt its routine. They’ll leave you alone. Usually. 

3:52 AM, the night was almost over, and I had only one visitor left. This last Repeater was technically our first, one we had encountered in the first few days our town became isolated. A lot of people broke down in those initial days, and most of us were too frightened and, frankly, too busy panicking  to focus on the Repeater problem. That led to a lot more of them, including the one I now had to face, the one I had to turn away. 

Taking a deep breath, I sat up from the couch and made my way to the door, checking the bolt of my rifle one last time. I was only slightly relieved to see the brass casing reflecting a soft bit of candlelight back at me. With any luck, no ammo would be spent tonight. 

If you must deal with a Repeater, try to learn exactly what their routine is, and mimic it to the best of your ability. Think of it as an acting exercise, try not to mess up, and be ready. 

Carefully stepping by the front door, I checked by the nightstand beside for the flashlight I kept there. Sure enough, there was a bright red, chunky plastic flashlight I used specially for events like tonight. Steeling myself, I slung the rifle behind my shoulder, just out of sight, and took the small twisting metal on the door knob in my hand. After a soft twist, I heard the barely discernible clicking of metal as the door unlocked. 

“Stay calm. You know what to say, what to do.” I said aloud to myself. Swinging the door open, I gently stepped outside into the cool night air, chirping crickets and cicadas quickly filling my ears as I took in the near pitch blackness of the treeline underneath the starless, cloudy night sky. I counted the seconds as I gripped the strap on my rifle tightly. 

One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six seconds. The first signs, deep breathing, panting, the cracking of leaves and snapping branches. 

“Hello! Anyone!” Came a distraught voice from the woods. Even all these years later, the pain in his voice was unmistakable. 

“Can anybody hear me?! Please, it’s my daughter!” He begged, I could see the tears on his face even before he came visible. My turn. 

“Hello? Who’s out there?” I asked, pitching my voice ever so slightly higher. The truth is, it was Sam who had been out here all those nights ago. Unable to sleep, trying desperately to reach his mom on his phone. In the distance, I saw a man stumble out of the woods and fall onto his hands and knees, huffing as he laid on the rocky road leading to the house. He was still too far away to see any features, but I could hear him panting, his breaths raspy as he desperately sucked in air. 

“Sir? Sir are you okay?” I asked with false concern. The frame of the man turned, still huffing as he stumbled up. The shuffling of rocks signified him getting closer, and I fought the urge to ready my rifle as my focus deepened, ready for anything. 

“Please, please you have to help me, it’s my daughter! One of those things got her!” He exclaimed as he stepped closer. I had no idea what the man looked like as he stopped a few feet from the steps leading up to our porch. There was only enough light from the clouded sky to reveal his shape, huffing, puffing, wheezing. 

“Those things? You mean the Repeaters?” I asked in Sam’s voice. The figure nodded frantically. 

“Yes, she got in their way and they took her into the woods! I need help, please I need to find her!” He begged. I pretended to acquiesce.

“I-I’ll go get some help, just stay there!” Without another word, I walked back to the door while keeping an eye on the figure, calmly opened it, and stepped inside. Technically, this was a deviation. Sam had been somewhat frantic that night, nearly throwing open the door as he rushed inside. His clattering had been what woke me up that night, sounds I most certainly hadn’t been making. These types of deviation are fine, so long as they don’t interrupt the Repeater, or drastically alter the events they’re trapped in. So, I grabbed the flashlight by the door, then proceeded to wait several minutes. 

I kept a close eye on the Repeater through a small peep hole as time crawled ever so slowly. Even though I was playing my part, there was no guarantee that everything around me would play out exactly the same. We were in the middle of the woods, surrounded on all sides by wild life, wild life that by its very nature was unpredictable. It’s best to keep an eye out when you have such a massive variable, one you can never fully account for. The Repeater, for his part, never deviated, following the same pattern I’d seen for years now. Exhausted huffing, placing his hands on his head and pacing as he waited outside, holding his arm periodically. 

4:01 AM, I could feel my stomach drop. Forcing myself to take a deep breath, I slung the rifle so I held it in one hand, tucked the flashlight under my arm with the other, then opened the door. I quickly shifted the flaslight to my open hand and flicked it on as I stepped outside, focusing on the Repeater. 

The Repeater, just like always, winced at the sudden light and turned to face me, holding out a dirt covered, scarred hand as he backed away slightly. His thin autumn coat was torn, ripped in several places and revealing hints of a long sleeved t-shirt. His grass stained jeans fared no better, small holes revealing scabbed skin in some places, and fresh cuts in others. Even all this time later, I pitied the man. When I’d first encountered him, his clothing had looked almost brand new, but years of reliving the worst day of his life had left them just as broken as he was. 

“Just focus… You’re almost done.” I told myself. 

“You, what did you say to my friend? Why are you even here?” I asked harshly, using my own voice this time. Like everyone else, I’d been confused and scared at the time, and on that particular night, had just experienced a sudden and unwanted awakening. If I could take back what I said, what I did, believe me, I would. Instead, I watched for the thousandth time as the man blinked rapidly, squinting as he fought against the light. His voice shook when he tried to respond. 

“I-I was just asking for help, I swear! My daughter, she was taken, I’m trying to-“ 

“At this time of night? What’s wrong with you?! You’re gonna get yourself and probably us killed!” I yelled, interrupting the man. I hated the venom in my voice, I hated the startled yelp the man let out as he raised his hands in a non-threatening gesture, pieces of fabric dangling from his arms. Most of all I hated what I’d missed all those nights ago, the sight of the man crying, barely holding it together. 

“Please, I just want-“ He tried to say, his voice trembling. Again I interrupted him. 

“I don’t care what you want, you need to leave, now.” The Repeater’s expression dropped, shaking his head in sheer disbelief and despair as he opened his mouth to speak again. 

CRASH. My heart leapt up into my throat. 

“No, no no no no…” I thought. In an instant I turned to my left, shining the beam of light towards the small gravel driveway that housed my car and our trashcans. In the light I could see both trash cans, both of which should have been standing. Instead, I could see one of them tipped over, trash spilling on the ground as a raccoon obliviously picked away at the escaping pile. My grip around the rifle tightened, and I could feel my flashlight hand begin to shiver. 

“Crap…” I thought. A deviation, and a big one. Turning back to the Repeater, I could see his expression and demeanor change in an instant. His fear, his despair, his pitiable stance were all gone. In their place I saw a hardened, almost animalistic rage in his eyes, fists clenching so tightly that I could see fresh blood dripping from where his long dirtied nails dug into his skin. His attention was divided between myself and the offending raccoon, his huffing breath turning into a heaving growl as the white in his eyes turned red. 

“Crap…” I said aloud. My mind went a mile a minute as I tried forcing myself to calm down, taking deep breaths and steadying my hands. 

“I said you need to leave, NOW.” I said in a shaking voice, trying desperately to get the Repeater to recognize his routine. The Repeater only growled louder, veins beginning to become visible in his hands and in his face. 

Without thinking I dropped the flashlight and heard it clattering to the ground as I raised my rifle, aiming at the Repeater as it became half bathed in light, half shrouded by darkness. 

“Don’t make me shoot you!” I shouted, my voice trembling as I trained my scope on the Repeater’s chest. I regretted the words as soon as I said them. This was another massive deviation. As poorly as I handled the situation years ago, I’d never threatened to shoot the man. Any chance I had now of keeping this from escalating was gone. The Repeater grit his teeth as he hissed in reply, his eyes becoming almost completely red as blood freely poured from his hands. 

Suddenly, the man roared, pouncing from a dead stop as he lept forward, screaming as he charged me at full sprint. 

“CRAP!” I yelled in a panic. 

CRACK, followed immediately by an ear shattering BANG. The shot had been both a reflex, and intentional all at once as it echoed across the formerly silent woods. Quick, easy, without thought. That’s the only way to deal with one attacking you, no mercy, no thought as to who they are or were, just rapid and decisive force. 

The shot hit the charging Repeater in the chest, the force of the round twisting his body as he stumbled and slammed into the ground. I quickly cycled the bolt, the sound of the empty brass casing hitting the wooden porch almost completely drowned out as the Repeater screamed in fury, fumbling with its hands to push itself back up. The monster rose his gaze to meet mine, its eyes practically dripping with fury as it roared, spit and blood flying from its lips as it tried to push towards me. 

A second CRACK and BANG left my ears ringing, and my head felt like it was almost splitting open from a sudden headache, a painful reminder that I’d forgotten to wear any form of ear protection. In the moment I hardly cared about that, however. My attention was focused on the man I’d just killed. His head was a mere fraction of what it was, now shattered and split partly open. Shards of his bloody skull were visible in the beam of the flashlight, and I found myself feeling sick to my stomach. 

Even knowing what he was, I felt a twinge of guilt welling up in my stomach as a wave of exhaustion swept over me. This was twice now I had killed him, I realized. Thoughts of him somehow getting better and returning to himself flooded my mind for an instant before falling away, replaced by the sight of his lifeless body. 

“I… I’m sorry…” Was all I could say as I lowered the rifle, my hearing slowly retuning to me as I took a step back. 

“Damien?! Damien what happened, are you alright?!” I heard the panicked voice of my friend shout. 

“I’m fine, Sam. I’m fine.” I lied as I cycled the bolt a second time, letting the expended round fall to the ground outside before stepping back inside, my eyes never leaving the body in front of me. Even as I closed the door, I could hear the distant sound of two more screams somewhere in the woods, more Repeaters, more people who’d gotten lost in the woods. More people who’d lost hope.

Sam and I didn’t sleep the rest of that night. Occasionally, we’d hear a rabid Repeater slamming against our windows or our door as they screamed, held our breath as they tried bashing their way in. Morning came before they could make progress, and, for whatever reason, they fell back into their routines. 

I’ll let that be the last lesson, before signing off and leaving you with this post. If you have the ability to, hunker down and hide from the Repeaters if you suspect they’ll come after you. You won’t be able to outrun them. If there’s enough of them, and believe me, make enough noise and there will be, you won’t be able to out fight them. Just hide. Hide, and pray they don’t find you. Try to fix whatever damage they do when it’s safe, then get ready to deal with them again. 

 If you have any other questions, leave them here, I guess. I’m sure Sam or myself with get to them at some point. 

Above all, stay safe, try not to give up. We don’t need more of them around here. ",2,1757523455.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1ndjs3p,https://on.ft.com/4nekZgu,How Tokyo became an unexpected haven for China’s middle class,"I found this article to be incredibly enlightening and something I hadn't considered in terms of China's immigration patterns to Japan over the years. Thoughts?

For those who don't have access (if the gift link expires), here's a slightly abbreviated version (posting the full article is against FT T&Cs):

*Placing her teacup on the lacquered table, a chic Tokyo-ite turns towards the café’s open window to absorb the beauty of a July day in the Japanese capital. Outside, the leaves on the avenue of ginkgo trees are a rich summer green; the early afternoon sun thrums down on Ueno Park. Crowds wander towards the country’s oldest national museum.*

*“I so, so love this city. But, over the past few months, I have started to change the route I take when walking through my neighbourhood,” she confesses. “I use smaller streets — the ones the Chinese don’t use. There are too many Chinese around these days. I keep hearing Chinese being spoken everywhere. That wasn’t why I left.”*

*The problem was less acute 18 months ago, when the former business executive, who asks to be referred to as Cao, brought her children from China to start a new life in Tokyo. She had planned her move before China’s middle classes had begun looking at Japan with migratory eyes, before dozens of real-estate influencers on RedNote and other social media had begun fizzing about the opportunities of property ownership in Bunkyo, the Tokyo district where she now lives.*

*Cao reckons that, in early 2024, there were just three Chinese families, including her own, in her apartment building. Now there are 11, and her observations of furniture deliveries and the language spoken in the lifts suggest more are on the way. A new Chinese community is forming, she says, with the same jealousies and obsessions she left home to avoid. Cao is now plotting a second move to a part of the city with fewer Chinese.*

*Despite her misgivings about it, Cao is unavoidably a member of this burgeoning diaspora. She is Run-ri: the label given to the wave of middle-class Chinese who have moved to Japan for a lifestyle they see as impossible back home. Some Run-ri want permanent residency in Japan, and the ability to travel back to China for business. Many arrive with no intention of ever returning. Cao says she is here to assimilate, but cannot guess how many of the other Run-ri are.*

*It’s a phenomenon few saw coming, either in Japan or China. Back in Shanghai and other big Chinese cities, according to more than 20 Chinese residents of Tokyo interviewed by the Financial Times, dinner party conversations are dominated by the mechanics of how to get to Tokyo or Osaka — and stay there.*

*There is a code at these dinners, which signals a desire to turn the conversation to the topic, according to another Run-ri, Zhang Jieping, a Tokyo-based journalist and entrepreneur who has founded a Chinese bookstore in the city. The way to do it is to ask one’s fellow diners: “How long do you plan to stay?”*

*“That signals that you want to talk about visas,” Zhang says. “The conversation is always about emigration. Of every three-hour dinner, two will be spent talking about other countries’ visa requirements, how to get out, how to marry a local, how to get an apartment, how to get your parents over there and how to get cash out. Every dinner, every lunch. And everyone talks about Japan.”*

*In these conversations, there is a tacit admission that, for all its “lost” economic decades and flagging dynamism, Japan has got a great deal right. It ranks highly on global indices of peace, economic freedom and property rights. In politics, the nation has kept its poise as others have thrown tantrums, remained supple as others stiffened. It has reliable medical provision, free speech, safe streets, incredible service and astonishingly good food. Beyond these practicalities, there is an almost ideological element to the movement, says Zhang. “The Chinese mindset for the past 30 years has been that leaving is always better. You leave the country for the town. You leave the town for the city. You leave the city for a big city. You leave the big city for the US. Now, you leave for Tokyo.”*

*By making their move at this particular moment in history, the Run-ri are shaping the coming decades of Japan’s demographic, social and perhaps even political destiny. Some economists speculate that we are watching the early phases of the country’s ascent to an “immigration superpower”. They are hopeful for an injection of entrepreneurial energy that will prove invaluable in ageing, shrinking Japan. Others sense trouble ahead, as Chinese buyers propel Tokyo property prices beyond the reach of many Japanese. The government has been pushed to tighten the requirements for the “business manager” visas on which so many Chinese secure their residencies. Some predict a full nationalist backlash, pointing to the klaxons of xenophobia audible in July’s upper-house election campaigns. Because Tokyo is not just a magnet for people wishing to leave China, but for Chinese money too. As well as those seeking a new life, there are some who simply see the city as a financial investment and plan to keep a foot in China for as long as possible.*

*For now, though, the Run-ri have endowed Tokyo with a status it never expected and is largely at a loss to quantify. Whether it is the intellectuals sniping at Beijing from the safety of Jimbocho coffee shops, the more cash-constrained middle classes finding apartments in areas near good local schools, the richer arrivals steadily occupying more of Tokyo’s prime waterfront, or the very wealthiest establishing roots in the swish “3A” districts of Azabu, Aoyama and Akasaka, the Japanese capital is being recast as a Chinese haven.*

*The word Run-ri — broadly used to cover the middle-class entrepreneurs, white-collar workers, wealthier academics, retirees and intellectuals moving to Japan for aspirational reasons — combines two Chinese characters. The run primarily means liquidity or prosperity, but its similarity in sound to the English word “run” also conveys the idea of flight. The second character, ri, is the first in the Chinese word for Japan. The term has been around for a few years, but it has jostled into the mainstream lexicon since about 2022, the peak of the Shanghai Covid-19 lockdowns and, for many cosmopolitan Chinese, a psychological tipping-point: the “life inflection point”, as many describe it.*

*The numbers are startling. Without ever having declared any kind of open-door policy on immigration, Japan has quietly addressed both its demographic decline and worker shortage by allowing its non-Japanese population to surge to about 3.5 million, or just under 3 per cent of the population. The number of foreign residents rose by an average of roughly 1,000 per day over the course of 2024, of which about 10 per cent were Chinese. By next year, according to some projections, the total Chinese population of Japan is likely to hit a million.*

*The Run-ri tend to have certain things in common: relative wealth, an obsession with education, a faith in Tokyo real estate as a store of value — and aspirations to own a seven-seater Toyota Alphard.*

*“Yes, I am Run-ri. I think I fit many of the descriptions,” agreed a 41-year-old IT engineer who left Shenzhen in 2022 and was dropping his son off at an after-hours tutorial school near Toyosu station when approached by the FT. The school is one of many in pockets of Tokyo where Chinese represent more than 10 per cent of the student cohort. There has also been a surge of Chinese enquiries for places in Tokyo’s international schools, to as much as 60 per cent of the total in some cases.*

*The engineer’s apartment is nearby in the Branz tower, a huge block of high-end flats overlooking Tokyo Bay, of which about 20 per cent are believed to have been sold to people with Chinese names, according to local estate agents. A listing for a three-bedroom flat in a nearby tower displayed in the window of a Chinese-owned estate agent in Roppongi had an asking price of ¥350mn ($2.4mn). Other newly built developments nearby, including a vast complex built as the athletes’ village for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, have similar ratios of Chinese buyers.*

*“My wife and I wanted a city life, and we thought we had that in Shenzhen. But during the pandemic, and maybe before that, we saw a more scary side of China,” the engineer said. “A state that knew it could do anything it wanted, and no longer seemed interested in protecting the middle class. It was difficult to leave our home, but also easy to start a new one here.”*

*For many Chinese, the first proper encounter with Japan and Japanese people is as tourists. Some seven million visited Japan from mainland China last year. Often, these visits dispel negative images of Japan that have been established over decades.*

*Cao first came to Tokyo in 2017 on a business trip for the trading company she was working for, and she quickly fell for the city. “I had decided by the following year that I wanted to move here. I liked the calmer atmosphere. Even when places are crowded, they feel calm here.”*

*She homed in on Bunkyo ward for its reputation as the educational heart of the Japanese capital. A single mother of two, Cao has stretched herself financially to make a life for her family in Tokyo, and the state-run schools and private crammers in the area have a reputation for quality. There are some local government subsidies for residents on tight budgets, and children who arrive in the local public schools in Bunkyo not speaking Japanese as their first language are offered a certain number of extra Japanese language lessons.*

*Meanwhile, Japan’s schools are emptying. In 2016, the number of Japanese babies born fell below one million for the first time since records began in 1899. By 2024, the number was just 686,000. In rural Japan, that has meant a steady beat of school closures, but in the middle of Tokyo it means there are places available. The effect has been striking.*

*Very quickly, Cao found herself pulled into an educational arms race with other Chinese parents. “The middle class? They are super, super competitive, and that is a big part of what they want here,” says Cao, opening her phone to reveal a school chat group of Chinese parents. It is a cavalcade of paranoia and passive aggression. “Should the kids go to a private or a public school? Should they do this particular exam? Is that school good? Is that teacher intelligent enough? What scores did everyone get? It’s not what I wanted,” she says.*

*As the Chinese community in Bunkyo has expanded, the children have begun to group together and do not speak Japanese outside school, she says. Within school, it is already becoming a distraction. “A lot of Chinese like to be in that environment, but I do not,” says Cao, who prefers not to be too explicit about where she plans to move next for fear that other Run-ri will follow.*

*Many thousands of Chinese leave their country every year — for the US, Canada, Australia, Europe or other parts of Asia. Historically, China produced a large flow of emigrants with almost no assets. More recently, it has become a world leader in the export of high-net-worth individuals (those with liquid assets over $1mn), with an estimated 12,500 departing in 2024.*

*Economic instability and tightening authoritarianism at home is now producing a third category of leavers: middle-class Chinese headed for what might be described as the Bolt-hole of the Rising Sun, just a three-hour flight from Shanghai. At the same time, President Donald Trump and his Maga movement have caused many would-be Chinese emigrants to cross the US off their preferred-destination lists. A small but growing number of Chinese, known as the Er-run (“second runners”), who moved to the US years or even decades ago, are also jumping ship again — to Japan.*

*Despite Tokyo’s vulnerability to regional tensions, trade wars and natural disasters, the city seems to suit an era of globalised uncertainty. A chronically weak yen makes everything seem cheap to those with foreign assets. And, for now at least, Japan makes it relatively easy for incomers to obtain a visa as a highly skilled professional or business owner. Setting up a company of a type that supports at least one business manager visa requires roughly $35,000 of capital and a further $5,000–$10,000 of administrative fees, according to several lawyers. Plans have been mooted by the government to significantly expand the minimum required capital.*

*Was it any coincidence that Alibaba founder Jack Ma chose to move to Tokyo, of all possible cities, when he fell out of favour with Beijing in late 2021? “Of course it was not,” says one close Japanese acquaintance of the billionaire, who used to meet Ma regularly at a Chinese-owned private members’ club in the city. “What is far more fascinating is that the same calculations now make perfect sense to those with only a minuscule fraction of Ma’s fortune.”*

*Ma was followed to Tokyo by others from China’s business elite, a trend that only added to its aspirational allure. Occasional sightings of Chinese tech founders walking nonchalantly around Nogizaka or Ginza in casual clothes have become fodder for Chinese social media as well as right-of-centre Japanese outlets harrumphing that no good will come of this migratory tsunami.*

*But it is the more modest incoming Chinese wealth that demands the most scrutiny, says Takehiro Masutomo, an academic and journalist whose book Run Ri was published in January. The book (available only in Japanese) is the first serious probe of the Run-ri phenomenon as a socio-economic force, and continues to sell strongly. Even without Masutomo’s work — which notes ski resorts, forests, sake breweries, hotels, restaurants and other businesses being cornered by incoming Chinese buyers — it is becoming impossible to ignore what is happening. The total size of the Chinese population in Japan was about 200,000 in 1995. It rose through the early 2000s, and settled at roughly 700,000 between 2010 and 2021. Since then, though, the numbers have soared.*

*Masutomo estimates about 100,000 immigrants fit the definition of Run-ri. He notes distinct waves: between the early 1980s and early 2010s, settlers were often from Fujian and China’s north-east, and lived mostly in rural Japan or cheaper suburbs of Tokyo and Osaka. They were mainly trainees or students, had few assets, could speak Japanese and were pro-Beijing. A much larger proportion of today’s arrivals, meanwhile, come from Tier-1 Chinese cities, live in the central wards of big metropolises, have sizable financial assets, are not fluent in Japanese and have little affection for the Xi Jinping regime.*

*A Shanghai native who used to work in online media and who asked to be known as James is one of those preparing to leave. James’s wife will move to Japan on a highly skilled professional visa, and he will follow. They are just weeks away from becoming Run-ri. After extensive research, James fixed on Urawa, a suburb about 70 minutes from central Tokyo, as the place to live. The property is relatively cheap and the public education is good, he says. But underlying all his decisions is something else: “In the past, it was always about America. Nobody wants to go to the US now. Not with Trump. A lot of us have membership of the Chinese Communist party, just because that was what we needed to do to get ahead in business. So now, with that membership, you are afraid you’ll probably be denied a \[US\] visa.”*

*Tokyo feels politically safer. “I don’t know who will win between the US and China, but Japan is in the middle. Japan is a good place to set up my second life,” says James. “Japan is stable. It has rational politics. It has no Chinese nationalists. No Maga. It just has a normal society. And I think that the number of people \[in Shanghai\] who share this kind of thinking is on the rise. Everyone has a third term for Trump or a fourth term for Xi in their mind, and they don’t like it.”*

*Once the Run-ri decide to leave China, they confront a series of practical obstacles and financial risks. A parallel service industry of Chinese and Japanese entrepreneurs has emerged to solve these problems. At least one private hospital in central Tokyo has renovated entire floors to cater to wealthy foreigners, assuming most will be Chinese. Japan’s biggest investment banks have expanded domestic services to target the wealthiest Run-ri. Some of Japan’s best sushi and teppanyaki chefs, said two restaurateurs, have vanished behind the doors of private clubs built principally for Chinese clients. Ambition DX, a Tokyo-listed real-estate brokerage, explicitly advertises itself as an expert in catering to the Run-ri boom.*

*Alex Hayashi, founder of Compass Capital, a consulting firm started in Tokyo in 2019, suggests that few in Japan — whether in finance or government — grasp how unlike any previous wave of immigration this influx is. “Why are there so many Chinese entrepreneurs here? Because they feel they have no other options,” he said. “In the past, people trying to get out of China would head for Singapore, but it’s too small, there are not enough investment opportunities. There was a previous wave of Hongkongers wanting to move to Tokyo, but they weren’t looking for double-digit investment returns like the new generation of Chinese do.”*

*The most tangible impact has been on property prices in Tokyo — an issue over which populist Japanese politicians have stoked anger. Prices of higher-end apartments in the capital, and land in central wards for low-rise houses, have risen significantly since 2022. Masutomo says the influx is jarring for Japanese. For more than 60 years, since it became a developed nation, Japan thought of itself as the richest and most sophisticated country in Asia. That idea is now being challenged by wealthy colonists, particularly humiliating because of the weakness of the yen.*

*“I think this is the first time that Japan has really confronted richer and more sophisticated immigrants from Asia,” says Masutomo. “It is making Japanese people feel poor in their own country.”*

*A sporty man in his thirties, who asks to be known as Guo, meets me in a busy café in Nakano — a lively, shabby warren of often Chinese-owned restaurants and bars. Guo moved with his wife from Beijing to Tokyo in 2022. They obtained working visas in about four months, he says. Many of their friends are also in Tokyo on business manager visas. To qualify, they either set up companies or bought small, failing Japanese businesses on the cheap.*

*Guo works for one of what he reckons are about 50 Chinese-staffed real-estate agents catering to other Chinese. Many of his colleagues left or were cut from big Chinese tech companies such as Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba and Meituan. Some went to Rakuten or Japanese travel firms. “We get 200 enquiries every month, and perhaps a deal or two every week. There is an urgency in their buying, because they have seen property prices collapse in China and they see Tokyo as a place where property values will hold,” Guo says.*

*About half of the deals are made by Chinese who intend to live in the properties. They have specific requirements: enough floorspace to bring elderly relatives from China or host visitors, and — very importantly — a parking space big enough for a Toyota Alphard. A new Alphard costs the equivalent of $130,000 in China and carries huge status. In Japan, the same car costs about $40,000. “They have seen celebrities in China being driven around in them. They want to buy all of that prestige but for a really low price in yen.”*

*When Guo and his wife arrived in Tokyo, they faced the usual problems. Very rich Chinese can set up bank accounts or paper companies in Singapore and Hong Kong to remit funds into Japan. But for most Run-ri, says Guo, opening a Japanese bank account, getting savings out of China or even renting a flat is a challenge. An extensive underground banking system has emerged to circumvent China’s restrictions on capital flows. Guo and three others estimate that about 70 per cent of Tokyo-based property transactions by Chinese buyers involve one of these underground banks.*

*It works like this: the banks convert renminbi into yen via a complex network of laundering facilities that include dollar-generating Chinese import businesses in Africa. The customer delivers funds to a representative of the bank in China, then arranges to receive yen at various locations in Japanese cities. Cash is couriered in huge quantities — one agent said a North Face waterproof rucksack is the favoured receptacle — with the underground bankers taking as much as a 100 basis point margin on each transaction. A million dollars’ worth of renminbi can be converted into yen in about a day. “It has to be very discreet. A lot of the customers are the families of Chinese government officials,” says Guo.*

*The “accidental” founder of several Chinese bookstores, Zhang Jieping, was born in Wuxi and moved to Tokyo in 2024. Leading me from a café near Koenji station through side streets, she shows me her shop, Nowhere Party. Inside, the apartment has been converted into a small, elegantly congested bookshop selling commentary and criticism that cannot appear on shelves in Xi’s China.*

*Zhang’s shop, which opened this year, doubles as a space for lectures, book clubs and discussion groups. It is one of four Chinese bookstores to open in Tokyo in the past three years, alongside Daxiangjie (One Way Street) and Juwairen (The Stranger). Zhang, a journalist for more than a decade, had previously opened bookshops in Taipei, Chiang Mai and The Hague. “A bookshop owner follows people’s demands. One role is as a business owner, the other is as an observer of communities. It’s like a window.”*

*About 60 per cent of her Tokyo customers are from mainland China. Some of the books she sells are banned outright there; others are simply unavailable. While there is interest in “juicy topics” like direct criticism of Xi, Zhang says Run-ri in Tokyo are increasingly more interested in broader geopolitical reading.*

*Masutomo agrees. By mid-2024, he noticed an “intellectual flight” to Tokyo: older Chinese, including academics, moving to the suburbs. “I don’t think they are trying to start a revolution from here, but it is interesting. The steady opening of bookshops and the concentration of Chinese intellectuals is quite unique. I don’t know other major cities where that happens apart from Tokyo.”*

*He argues that the simultaneous integration of Chinese wealth and Chinese intellectuals will be key over the coming decade. “If they combine in a meaningful way, that will become political and they might be monitored more seriously by the CCP,” he says.*

*One such dissident is Jia Jia, in his forties, who came on a visiting scholarship to the University of Tokyo. His main outlet is YouTube debates with other Chinese intellectuals. Before fleeing with his wife, Jia was detained by Chinese authorities under suspicion of involvement in an open letter calling on Xi to resign. Released but still under scrutiny, he left for Japan.*

*“I don’t think I’m like most of the other Chinese who have come to Tokyo,” Jia says. “I was chased by the police. I am like a dissident. What has made me most happy has been coming to Tokyo. Here I sleep comfortably at night. I live without fear.”*

*But he admits Tokyo has changed him. The haven has softened his edges. His writing has slowed, and he has begun to appreciate peace. “Some Chinese seek to find China in Japan,” he says. “Others try to change the course of China from Japan. A third group just tries to forget about China as soon as they arrive.”*

*While that may capture how many Run-ri see Tokyo, there is no such neat summary of how Tokyo views them. The newcomers are a reminder that the city’s greatest asset is its capacity for reinvention, reconstruction and reimagining. Those powers have already been tested by war, natural disasters and economic catastrophe. The odds that it can manage immigration are good.*",7,1757523422.0,japan,3,0.68,False

My name is Damien, and I have been surviving in the town of McDougal ever since it vanished on the evening of April 28th, 2018. I live in a small isolated house in the middle of the surrounding woods, about half a mile outside of town proper with my friend Sam. I say vanished because to the rest of the world, I’m sure that’s precisely what happened. From what I’ve been told by those arriving after the fact, that’s the day that McDougal completely vanished from the map, or at least its people did. Supposedly, all of the buildings, cars, even food that was being eaten that day all remained. 

For us, it was more of the rest of the world simply vanishing. Granted, we could only go as far as our cars could take us, but every town we came across, every city, every state was abandoned. Even massive metropolises known for housing millions of people were void of human life. To us, it wasn’t McDougal that had disappeared, it was the rest of the population, leaving only our small town of 2,000 people as the last bastion of humanity in an empty world. 

Before anyone asks, no, I’m not here to tell you what happened. I’m not going to tell you what we discovered on our expeditions outside of town, I’m not here to tell you why this happened to our isolated community (not that I even could), and I’m not here to offer an explanation as to why you had the misfortune to wind up here. Honestly, I try not to think about that stuff. Maybe if there’s enough interest, Sam can talk to you about that in a follow up post, or in the comments. My purpose today with this post is simpler, more fundamental. 

Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of new faces in town, the few times I’ve actually bothered to head down there. There was a time that wasn’t always the case, and it was only ever those that were initially pulled in after the entire town I call home seemed to become isolated. But over the past few months, we’ve been getting a slew of amateur podcasters, self labeled urban explorers, so called “paranormal investigators”, even the odd military man suddenly arriving overnight in town. They always say the same thing, that they fell asleep within the walls that used to house the residents of McDougal, and then they wake up here, with us. Most of them don’t last a week, some don’t even last their first day. 

So at Sam’s behest, I’m offering this post as a basic guideline. I’ll run you through what the average night looks like for him and I so you can model that routine and not wind up as another victim. Personally I don’t care if you heed my warnings or not, but Sam is adamant that we have some sort of duty to keep newcomers safe. So if for no other reason, just pay attention for Sam’s sake. The following took place last night, and is a good, all encompassing example of what you can expect now that you’re stuck here with us. 

At four hours until midnight, darkness begins to loom over the trees surrounding our small home in the woods. Before night fully falls, Sam and I work together to inspect the house’s entrances. Front door, side porch, windows, everything. We ensure that the wooden boards we use to block them off are secured, that it’s impossible for anyone or anything to get in. Some days we discover that the boards are shattered, or forcefully pulled away from the house, and we replace them. Once we’re just about done, I leave him to finish up and perform one last check on our surroundings, make sure I don’t see anything moving in the veil of brown and green surrounding us. 

During the daylight hours, the woods serve a number of purposes, such as isolation from people I don’t wish to deal with, natural cover from any new threats, and as a source of small game in the form of squirrels and rabbits, even the odd deer if I’m lucky. At night, however, they serve as a place for panicking people to get lost, and as cover for the Repeaters. 

If you don’t know what those are, look at the name and think for a second. You know those people around town who have the same conversations with clearly different peopke, knock on doors to abandoned buildings and go inside, or those who walk the exact same way for the exact same amount of time? Notice how they do those things day after day, with no alteration? Yeah, those are Repeaters, and they’re more dangerous than you think. We don’t get many out this way, but there are more than a few who are trapped in the cycle of hopelessly wandering the woods. So, we keep an eye out.

At three hours to midnight, we get inside the house and lock the front door, light some lanterns and candles for light, and make sure anything that we could step on or stumble over is out of the way. Next we check to make sure there’s nothing causing any noticeably audible noise that can be heard from outside. Sometimes that means one of us going back out and listening while the other checks an appliance, especially if it’s something new. We have to be thorough, after all. If our dishwasher or laundry is running, we stop it. 

One thing you need to learn quick is that anything is better than breaking a Repeater’s pattern. Soggy clothes, missing shoes, a bruised elbow, anything. I don’t care how much you hate leaving something unfinished or how much you need the air conditioning going to be able to sleep. If using an object or completing a task would interrupt a Repeater, LEAVE IT. It’s not worth your life. 

At two hours to midnight, we do a weapons check. Dissemble our guns, make sure they’re clean and in working order. We check how much ammo we have, make sure we have the right ammo. For us, that’s 30.06 for our Winchester 70, and .45 ACP for our 1911. Technically you don’t need bullets with that much stopping power, anything that can drop a human target reliably will suit you just fine. But be warned, the Repeaters can take a lot of damage, way more than you would think or expect. So stopping power helps a lot, buys you time. 

We also keep at least one close quarters weapon on us, usually something that stabs or bashes. For me, that equates to a ten inch hunting knife my father gave me for my eighteenth birthday. If you’re like Sam, that means a baseball bat, something powerful enough to stop something coming at you, but not lethal enough to kill it in one hit. Usually. You don’t need those exact items, anything that works against closing in threats is perfectly adequate. Ideally, you don’t want anything getting that close to you, that’s what the guns are for. But it’s better to have and not need than to need and not have, as the saying goes. 

At one hour to midnight, we figure out who’s staying up on watch. We get our plan together, make sure we’re both on the same page. Last night’s conversation went something like this;

“I can keep watch tonight. You’ve been staying up the past three nights now, it’s not good for you, man.” Sam said as he sat opposite to me at the small circular kitchen table. He fidgeted with this fingers, a kind expression written across his face as he leaned forward. 

“I’m fine. I don’t mind sleeping during the day.” I rebutted, ignoring his silent pressuring. 

“We could always switch to shifts, like I recommended.” I knew his offer was sincere, but I didn’t like the idea of trying to set that up in just one hour. 

“No. Too risky.” Sam sighed and rubbed his forehead, clearly exasperated with me. 

“It’s not like we’d be screaming at each other, Damien. Just shaking the other awake, making sure they’re good and-“

“I said no.” 

“Damien.” Sam’s voice sounded noticeably worried, despite his efforts to hide it. 

“Sam, I’m fine. What we’re doing works, and we don’t have time to change it. We can talk about in the morning if it bothers you.” 

“Which it does.” He said somewhat sternly. 

“Then think of a good argument for it, maybe you’ll change my mind. Good night Sam.” I think he realized that I wasn’t budging on this one, not tonight. Without a word he pulled the 1911 from behind his pants and set it on the table in front of me. 

“At least hold onto this,then.” I stared at the wooden handle of the pistol for a moment, the recently cleaned iron shimmering in the candlelight.

“What if you need it? I already have the rifle.” I argued, pulling it up from under the table and setting it in front of me. Sam shook his head. 

“If we’re not doing shifts, there’s no point in me having it. The people out there are getting worse and I’m worried…” I noticed his voice catch in his throat, and he seemed to fight something back. He always worried too much, poor Sam. A pang of sadness ran through me as he cleared his throat before continuing. 

“I’m worried there’s gonna be more than you can take with a bolt action. You need to be able to handle them fast if worse comes to worse. So please, take it. I’ll hear you if you fire anyway.” I wanted to argue more, point out that if rifle fire did wake him up, he would easily be able to rush to my defense and use the gun if he still had it on him. Besides, for all his talk of wanting me safe, I wanted him safe too. There was, after all, a window in the bedroom. Boarded up, secured, maybe, but there was a good chance it wouldn’t stay that way. 

Still, this was clearly important to him, and more pressingly, we were short on time. So I relented, sighing as I took the strap on the rifle and slung it over my shoulder. 

“Safety’s on.” Sam reminded me as I took hold of the pistol and slipped it neatly into the back of my trousers. I nodded at him, and saw a faint smile of relief cross his face as he sat back, the candlelight only just barely revealing his short blonde hair and green eyes. There was a silent thank you in his expression, one that I’m sure was supposed to make me feel better. 

All it did was make me seriously consider shifts after all. 

Midnight. Sam was asleep, or at least he better have been. I’d given him my room for the night, as I sat on the couch that normally served as his sleeping spot. The room was bathed in the soft candlelight from the center of the old coffee table. In the light I could see the outlines of our old television, some old photos depicting either Sam’s family or mine, the old recliner I’d sit in when we we’d watch TV in the odd case we had a lazy day, and of course, the front door, locked and secure. 

Anything beyond that was only vague shapes. The candlelight was just bright enough to reveal their presence, but did not extend deep enough into the darkness to expose their details. A large circular disc denoted the kitchen table, and a few rectangular blocks were the only indication I had of our refrigerator, cupboards, dishwasher, and sink. That is to say nothing of the small gap behind me, leading to a small hallway that, though I knew led to the bathroom, laundry room, and bedroom, appeared to be nothing more than a deep wall of blackness. The thick dark caused my chest to feel heavier as I observed it, and I felt my grip on the rifle tighten. 

I did my best to keep my mind from wandering or succumbing to fear, instead keeping close attention to any noise I heard around the house, and outside. Every so often I would look at the watch given to me by mother before I left home, noting the time so I’d be ready for each event. 

12:52 AM was when things truly started. While we had mostly boarded up the window overlooking our front yard, there were still small slits between the boards of wood that we could use to peek out if necessary. Unfortunately, this also meant things from outside could look in once they got close enough.

We kept our windows ever so slightly open at night. If you don’t have any major activity by your home, you obviously don’t need to do this, as it is a risky, oftentimes unnecessary gamble in the event you, or something in your shelter makes noise. For Sam and I, however, it was the only way we could hear the approaching footsteps and of our first visitor. 

Upon hearing the telltale signs of crackling twigs and old leaves, I moved away from the couch, stepping slowly to the side of the window as I clutched my rifle close to my chest. 

One thud, two thuds, three thuds. My heart began racing, and I forced myself to hold my breath. For a moment there was nothing, as whatever made the sounds outside my home silently peered inside. A deep groan filled the air as I took another cautious step away from the window. Out of the blackness, in flickering light, I saw burly looking fingers curl around one of the planks of wood, as the first Repeater lifted a long dead flashlight to my window. 

“Hello? Is anyone in there, I need a little help.” The man’s voice wasn’t threatening in the slightest, if anything it was slightly pitiable. There was a shakiness to it, a tiredness, like he was trying to catch his breath. I said nothing, no one had been here the night he arrived looking for help, and so no one could be tonight either. 

Knock. Knock. Knock as the man gave three soft pounds against the wood. The man peered closer to the window. I could just see his shape leering close to the window, using the free hand to hold over his eyes, lifting the dead flashlight higher through one of the cracks. No doubt he saw the candle, which of course hadn’t been there the first night either. Thankfully, that deviation was so small it meant next to nothing. 

“Hello?” Asked the man again. I kept still, my finger twitching as I fought to keep it off the trigger. One minute, two minutes, three minutes passed as the lifeless flashlight passed over and over across the window. 

“Please, I’m lost, I just need some help.” The man’s voice was soft, pleading. I did not respond, I could not respond. It may seem heartless, but he was too far gone. After a minute more, the Repeater gave up with a defeated sigh, and loudly began to stomp away from the window. I didn’t immediately return to my spot on the couch, instead waiting a few more minutes until I could no longer hear his stomping, or his defeated gasps of breath as he left. After I was satisfied, I let out the breath I was holding and sat back down, trying to force my chest to stop pounding through deep, calculated breaths. 

The next few hours were calm, save for the odd scratching and whispers asking if anyone was inside from the few people who’d found us from time to time. These Repeaters, thankfully, had not peered through the window as the first had. So, I needed only to keep my rifle at the ready, just in case something set them off. Another valuable lesson, if a Repeater has no reason to see you, don’t give it one. Stay out of its sight, don’t make a sound, don’t interrupt its routine. They’ll leave you alone. Usually. 

3:52 AM, the night was almost over, and I had only one visitor left. This last Repeater was technically our first, one we had encountered in the first few days our town became isolated. A lot of people broke down in those initial days, and most of us were too frightened and, frankly, too busy panicking  to focus on the Repeater problem. That led to a lot more of them, including the one I now had to face, the one I had to turn away. 

Taking a deep breath, I sat up from the couch and made my way to the door, checking the bolt of my rifle one last time. I was only slightly relieved to see the brass casing reflecting a soft bit of candlelight back at me. With any luck, no ammo would be spent tonight. 

If you must deal with a Repeater, try to learn exactly what their routine is, and mimic it to the best of your ability. Think of it as an acting exercise, try not to mess up, and be ready. 

Carefully stepping by the front door, I checked by the nightstand beside for the flashlight I kept there. Sure enough, there was a bright red, chunky plastic flashlight I used specially for events like tonight. Steeling myself, I slung the rifle behind my shoulder, just out of sight, and took the small twisting metal on the door knob in my hand. After a soft twist, I heard the barely discernible clicking of metal as the door unlocked. 

“Stay calm. You know what to say, what to do.” I said aloud to myself. Swinging the door open, I gently stepped outside into the cool night air, chirping crickets and cicadas quickly filling my ears as I took in the near pitch blackness of the treeline underneath the starless, cloudy night sky. I counted the seconds as I gripped the strap on my rifle tightly. 

One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six seconds. The first signs, deep breathing, panting, the cracking of leaves and snapping branches. 

“Hello! Anyone!” Came a distraught voice from the woods. Even all these years later, the pain in his voice was unmistakable. 

“Can anybody hear me?! Please, it’s my daughter!” He begged, I could see the tears on his face even before he came visible. My turn. 

“Hello? Who’s out there?” I asked, pitching my voice ever so slightly higher. The truth is, it was Sam who had been out here all those nights ago. Unable to sleep, trying desperately to reach his mom on his phone. In the distance, I saw a man stumble out of the woods and fall onto his hands and knees, huffing as he laid on the rocky road leading to the house. He was still too far away to see any features, but I could hear him panting, his breaths raspy as he desperately sucked in air. 

“Sir? Sir are you okay?” I asked with false concern. The frame of the man turned, still huffing as he stumbled up. The shuffling of rocks signified him getting closer, and I fought the urge to ready my rifle as my focus deepened, ready for anything. 

“Please, please you have to help me, it’s my daughter! One of those things got her!” He exclaimed as he stepped closer. I had no idea what the man looked like as he stopped a few feet from the steps leading up to our porch. There was only enough light from the clouded sky to reveal his shape, huffing, puffing, wheezing. 

“Those things? You mean the Repeaters?” I asked in Sam’s voice. The figure nodded frantically. 

“Yes, she got in their way and they took her into the woods! I need help, please I need to find her!” He begged. I pretended to acquiesce.

“I-I’ll go get some help, just stay there!” Without another word, I walked back to the door while keeping an eye on the figure, calmly opened it, and stepped inside. Technically, this was a deviation. Sam had been somewhat frantic that night, nearly throwing open the door as he rushed inside. His clattering had been what woke me up that night, sounds I most certainly hadn’t been making. These types of deviation are fine, so long as they don’t interrupt the Repeater, or drastically alter the events they’re trapped in. So, I grabbed the flashlight by the door, then proceeded to wait several minutes. 

I kept a close eye on the Repeater through a small peep hole as time crawled ever so slowly. Even though I was playing my part, there was no guarantee that everything around me would play out exactly the same. We were in the middle of the woods, surrounded on all sides by wild life, wild life that by its very nature was unpredictable. It’s best to keep an eye out when you have such a massive variable, one you can never fully account for. The Repeater, for his part, never deviated, following the same pattern I’d seen for years now. Exhausted huffing, placing his hands on his head and pacing as he waited outside, holding his arm periodically. 

4:01 AM, I could feel my stomach drop. Forcing myself to take a deep breath, I slung the rifle so I held it in one hand, tucked the flashlight under my arm with the other, then opened the door. I quickly shifted the flaslight to my open hand and flicked it on as I stepped outside, focusing on the Repeater. 

The Repeater, just like always, winced at the sudden light and turned to face me, holding out a dirt covered, scarred hand as he backed away slightly. His thin autumn coat was torn, ripped in several places and revealing hints of a long sleeved t-shirt. His grass stained jeans fared no better, small holes revealing scabbed skin in some places, and fresh cuts in others. Even all this time later, I pitied the man. When I’d first encountered him, his clothing had looked almost brand new, but years of reliving the worst day of his life had left them just as broken as he was. 

“Just focus… You’re almost done.” I told myself. 

“You, what did you say to my friend? Why are you even here?” I asked harshly, using my own voice this time. Like everyone else, I’d been confused and scared at the time, and on that particular night, had just experienced a sudden and unwanted awakening. If I could take back what I said, what I did, believe me, I would. Instead, I watched for the thousandth time as the man blinked rapidly, squinting as he fought against the light. His voice shook when he tried to respond. 

“I-I was just asking for help, I swear! My daughter, she was taken, I’m trying to-“ 

“At this time of night? What’s wrong with you?! You’re gonna get yourself and probably us killed!” I yelled, interrupting the man. I hated the venom in my voice, I hated the startled yelp the man let out as he raised his hands in a non-threatening gesture, pieces of fabric dangling from his arms. Most of all I hated what I’d missed all those nights ago, the sight of the man crying, barely holding it together. 

“Please, I just want-“ He tried to say, his voice trembling. Again I interrupted him. 

“I don’t care what you want, you need to leave, now.” The Repeater’s expression dropped, shaking his head in sheer disbelief and despair as he opened his mouth to speak again. 

CRASH. My heart leapt up into my throat. 

“No, no no no no…” I thought. In an instant I turned to my left, shining the beam of light towards the small gravel driveway that housed my car and our trashcans. In the light I could see both trash cans, both of which should have been standing. Instead, I could see one of them tipped over, trash spilling on the ground as a raccoon obliviously picked away at the escaping pile. My grip around the rifle tightened, and I could feel my flashlight hand begin to shiver. 

“Crap…” I thought. A deviation, and a big one. Turning back to the Repeater, I could see his expression and demeanor change in an instant. His fear, his despair, his pitiable stance were all gone. In their place I saw a hardened, almost animalistic rage in his eyes, fists clenching so tightly that I could see fresh blood dripping from where his long dirtied nails dug into his skin. His attention was divided between myself and the offending raccoon, his huffing breath turning into a heaving growl as the white in his eyes turned red. 

“Crap…” I said aloud. My mind went a mile a minute as I tried forcing myself to calm down, taking deep breaths and steadying my hands. 

“I said you need to leave, NOW.” I said in a shaking voice, trying desperately to get the Repeater to recognize his routine. The Repeater only growled louder, veins beginning to become visible in his hands and in his face. 

Without thinking I dropped the flashlight and heard it clattering to the ground as I raised my rifle, aiming at the Repeater as it became half bathed in light, half shrouded by darkness. 

“Don’t make me shoot you!” I shouted, my voice trembling as I trained my scope on the Repeater’s chest. I regretted the words as soon as I said them. This was another massive deviation. As poorly as I handled the situation years ago, I’d never threatened to shoot the man. Any chance I had now of keeping this from escalating was gone. The Repeater grit his teeth as he hissed in reply, his eyes becoming almost completely red as blood freely poured from his hands. 

Suddenly, the man roared, pouncing from a dead stop as he lept forward, screaming as he charged me at full sprint. 

“CRAP!” I yelled in a panic. 

CRACK, followed immediately by an ear shattering BANG. The shot had been both a reflex, and intentional all at once as it echoed across the formerly silent woods. Quick, easy, without thought. That’s the only way to deal with one attacking you, no mercy, no thought as to who they are or were, just rapid and decisive force. 

The shot hit the charging Repeater in the chest, the force of the round twisting his body as he stumbled and slammed into the ground. I quickly cycled the bolt, the sound of the empty brass casing hitting the wooden porch almost completely drowned out as the Repeater screamed in fury, fumbling with its hands to push itself back up. The monster rose his gaze to meet mine, its eyes practically dripping with fury as it roared, spit and blood flying from its lips as it tried to push towards me. 

A second CRACK and BANG left my ears ringing, and my head felt like it was almost splitting open from a sudden headache, a painful reminder that I’d forgotten to wear any form of ear protection. In the moment I hardly cared about that, however. My attention was focused on the man I’d just killed. His head was a mere fraction of what it was, now shattered and split partly open. Shards of his bloody skull were visible in the beam of the flashlight, and I found myself feeling sick to my stomach. 

Even knowing what he was, I felt a twinge of guilt welling up in my stomach as a wave of exhaustion swept over me. This was twice now I had killed him, I realized. Thoughts of him somehow getting better and returning to himself flooded my mind for an instant before falling away, replaced by the sight of his lifeless body. 

“I… I’m sorry…” Was all I could say as I lowered the rifle, my hearing slowly retuning to me as I took a step back. 

“Damien?! Damien what happened, are you alright?!” I heard the panicked voice of my friend shout. 

“I’m fine, Sam. I’m fine.” I lied as I cycled the bolt a second time, letting the expended round fall to the ground outside before stepping back inside, my eyes never leaving the body in front of me. Even as I closed the door, I could hear the distant sound of two more screams somewhere in the woods, more Repeaters, more people who’d gotten lost in the woods. More people who’d lost hope.

Sam and I didn’t sleep the rest of that night. Occasionally, we’d hear a rabid Repeater slamming against our windows or our door as they screamed, held our breath as they tried bashing their way in. Morning came before they could make progress, and, for whatever reason, they fell back into their routines. 

I’ll let that be the last lesson, before signing off and leaving you with this post. If you have the ability to, hunker down and hide from the Repeaters if you suspect they’ll come after you. You won’t be able to outrun them. If there’s enough of them, and believe me, make enough noise and there will be, you won’t be able to out fight them. Just hide. Hide, and pray they don’t find you. Try to fix whatever damage they do when it’s safe, then get ready to deal with them again. 

 If you have any other questions, leave them here, I guess. I’m sure Sam or myself with get to them at some point. 

Above all, stay safe, try not to give up. We don’t need more of them around here. ",3,1757523404.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I’d like to invite her for a coffee, but I don’t know if I should just send a text on WhatsApp or wait until I see her in person (which is not an everyday occurrence). Also, I’m not sure if she’s seeing someone or not.

Any advice on how I should approach this without making things awkward since we live in the same building? ",1,1757523370.0,Advice,3,1.0,False
1ndjqfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1ndjqfa/night_in_mcdougal/,Night in McDougal,"My name is Damien, and I have been surviving in the town of McDougal ever since it vanished on the evening of April 28th, 2018. I live in a small isolated house in the middle of the surrounding woods, about half a mile outside of town proper with my friend Sam. I say vanished because to the rest of the world, I’m sure that’s precisely what happened. From what I’ve been told by those arriving after the fact, that’s the day that McDougal completely vanished from the map, or at least its people did. Supposedly, all of the buildings, cars, even food that was being eaten that day all remained. 

For us, it was more of the rest of the world simply vanishing. Granted, we could only go as far as our cars could take us, but every town we came across, every city, every state was abandoned. Even massive metropolises known for housing millions of people were void of human life. To us, it wasn’t McDougal that had disappeared, it was the rest of the population, leaving only our small town of 2,000 people as the last bastion of humanity in an empty world. 

Before anyone asks, no, I’m not here to tell you what happened. I’m not going to tell you what we discovered on our expeditions outside of town, I’m not here to tell you why this happened to our isolated community (not that I even could), and I’m not here to offer an explanation as to why you had the misfortune to wind up here. Honestly, I try not to think about that stuff. Maybe if there’s enough interest, Sam can talk to you about that in a follow up post, or in the comments. My purpose today with this post is simpler, more fundamental. 

Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of new faces in town, the few times I’ve actually bothered to head down there. There was a time that wasn’t always the case, and it was only ever those that were initially pulled in after the entire town I call home seemed to become isolated. But over the past few months, we’ve been getting a slew of amateur podcasters, self labeled urban explorers, so called “paranormal investigators”, even the odd military man suddenly arriving overnight in town. They always say the same thing, that they fell asleep within the walls that used to house the residents of McDougal, and then they wake up here, with us. Most of them don’t last a week, some don’t even last their first day. 

So at Sam’s behest, I’m offering this post as a basic guideline. I’ll run you through what the average night looks like for him and I so you can model that routine and not wind up as another victim. Personally I don’t care if you heed my warnings or not, but Sam is adamant that we have some sort of duty to keep newcomers safe. So if for no other reason, just pay attention for Sam’s sake. The following took place last night, and is a good, all encompassing example of what you can expect now that you’re stuck here with us. 

At four hours until midnight, darkness begins to loom over the trees surrounding our small home in the woods. Before night fully falls, Sam and I work together to inspect the house’s entrances. Front door, side porch, windows, everything. We ensure that the wooden boards we use to block them off are secured, that it’s impossible for anyone or anything to get in. Some days we discover that the boards are shattered, or forcefully pulled away from the house, and we replace them. Once we’re just about done, I leave him to finish up and perform one last check on our surroundings, make sure I don’t see anything moving in the veil of brown and green surrounding us. 

During the daylight hours, the woods serve a number of purposes, such as isolation from people I don’t wish to deal with, natural cover from any new threats, and as a source of small game in the form of squirrels and rabbits, even the odd deer if I’m lucky. At night, however, they serve as a place for panicking people to get lost, and as cover for the Repeaters. 

If you don’t know what those are, look at the name and think for a second. You know those people around town who have the same conversations with clearly different peopke, knock on doors to abandoned buildings and go inside, or those who walk the exact same way for the exact same amount of time? Notice how they do those things day after day, with no alteration? Yeah, those are Repeaters, and they’re more dangerous than you think. We don’t get many out this way, but there are more than a few who are trapped in the cycle of hopelessly wandering the woods. So, we keep an eye out.

At three hours to midnight, we get inside the house and lock the front door, light some lanterns and candles for light, and make sure anything that we could step on or stumble over is out of the way. Next we check to make sure there’s nothing causing any noticeably audible noise that can be heard from outside. Sometimes that means one of us going back out and listening while the other checks an appliance, especially if it’s something new. We have to be thorough, after all. If our dishwasher or laundry is running, we stop it. 

One thing you need to learn quick is that anything is better than breaking a Repeater’s pattern. Soggy clothes, missing shoes, a bruised elbow, anything. I don’t care how much you hate leaving something unfinished or how much you need the air conditioning going to be able to sleep. If using an object or completing a task would interrupt a Repeater, LEAVE IT. It’s not worth your life. 

At two hours to midnight, we do a weapons check. Dissemble our guns, make sure they’re clean and in working order. We check how much ammo we have, make sure we have the right ammo. For us, that’s 30.06 for our Winchester 70, and .45 ACP for our 1911. Technically you don’t need bullets with that much stopping power, anything that can drop a human target reliably will suit you just fine. But be warned, the Repeaters can take a lot of damage, way more than you would think or expect. So stopping power helps a lot, buys you time. 

We also keep at least one close quarters weapon on us, usually something that stabs or bashes. For me, that equates to a ten inch hunting knife my father gave me for my eighteenth birthday. If you’re like Sam, that means a baseball bat, something powerful enough to stop something coming at you, but not lethal enough to kill it in one hit. Usually. You don’t need those exact items, anything that works against closing in threats is perfectly adequate. Ideally, you don’t want anything getting that close to you, that’s what the guns are for. But it’s better to have and not need than to need and not have, as the saying goes. 

At one hour to midnight, we figure out who’s staying up on watch. We get our plan together, make sure we’re both on the same page. Last night’s conversation went something like this;

“I can keep watch tonight. You’ve been staying up the past three nights now, it’s not good for you, man.” Sam said as he sat opposite to me at the small circular kitchen table. He fidgeted with this fingers, a kind expression written across his face as he leaned forward. 

“I’m fine. I don’t mind sleeping during the day.” I rebutted, ignoring his silent pressuring. 

“We could always switch to shifts, like I recommended.” I knew his offer was sincere, but I didn’t like the idea of trying to set that up in just one hour. 

“No. Too risky.” Sam sighed and rubbed his forehead, clearly exasperated with me. 

“It’s not like we’d be screaming at each other, Damien. Just shaking the other awake, making sure they’re good and-“

“I said no.” 

“Damien.” Sam’s voice sounded noticeably worried, despite his efforts to hide it. 

“Sam, I’m fine. What we’re doing works, and we don’t have time to change it. We can talk about in the morning if it bothers you.” 

“Which it does.” He said somewhat sternly. 

“Then think of a good argument for it, maybe you’ll change my mind. Good night Sam.” I think he realized that I wasn’t budging on this one, not tonight. Without a word he pulled the 1911 from behind his pants and set it on the table in front of me. 

“At least hold onto this,then.” I stared at the wooden handle of the pistol for a moment, the recently cleaned iron shimmering in the candlelight.

“What if you need it? I already have the rifle.” I argued, pulling it up from under the table and setting it in front of me. Sam shook his head. 

“If we’re not doing shifts, there’s no point in me having it. The people out there are getting worse and I’m worried…” I noticed his voice catch in his throat, and he seemed to fight something back. He always worried too much, poor Sam. A pang of sadness ran through me as he cleared his throat before continuing. 

“I’m worried there’s gonna be more than you can take with a bolt action. You need to be able to handle them fast if worse comes to worse. So please, take it. I’ll hear you if you fire anyway.” I wanted to argue more, point out that if rifle fire did wake him up, he would easily be able to rush to my defense and use the gun if he still had it on him. Besides, for all his talk of wanting me safe, I wanted him safe too. There was, after all, a window in the bedroom. Boarded up, secured, maybe, but there was a good chance it wouldn’t stay that way. 

Still, this was clearly important to him, and more pressingly, we were short on time. So I relented, sighing as I took the strap on the rifle and slung it over my shoulder. 

“Safety’s on.” Sam reminded me as I took hold of the pistol and slipped it neatly into the back of my trousers. I nodded at him, and saw a faint smile of relief cross his face as he sat back, the candlelight only just barely revealing his short blonde hair and green eyes. There was a silent thank you in his expression, one that I’m sure was supposed to make me feel better. 

All it did was make me seriously consider shifts after all. 

Midnight. Sam was asleep, or at least he better have been. I’d given him my room for the night, as I sat on the couch that normally served as his sleeping spot. The room was bathed in the soft candlelight from the center of the old coffee table. In the light I could see the outlines of our old television, some old photos depicting either Sam’s family or mine, the old recliner I’d sit in when we we’d watch TV in the odd case we had a lazy day, and of course, the front door, locked and secure. 

Anything beyond that was only vague shapes. The candlelight was just bright enough to reveal their presence, but did not extend deep enough into the darkness to expose their details. A large circular disc denoted the kitchen table, and a few rectangular blocks were the only indication I had of our refrigerator, cupboards, dishwasher, and sink. That is to say nothing of the small gap behind me, leading to a small hallway that, though I knew led to the bathroom, laundry room, and bedroom, appeared to be nothing more than a deep wall of blackness. The thick dark caused my chest to feel heavier as I observed it, and I felt my grip on the rifle tighten. 

I did my best to keep my mind from wandering or succumbing to fear, instead keeping close attention to any noise I heard around the house, and outside. Every so often I would look at the watch given to me by mother before I left home, noting the time so I’d be ready for each event. 

12:52 AM was when things truly started. While we had mostly boarded up the window overlooking our front yard, there were still small slits between the boards of wood that we could use to peek out if necessary. Unfortunately, this also meant things from outside could look in once they got close enough.

We kept our windows ever so slightly open at night. If you don’t have any major activity by your home, you obviously don’t need to do this, as it is a risky, oftentimes unnecessary gamble in the event you, or something in your shelter makes noise. For Sam and I, however, it was the only way we could hear the approaching footsteps and of our first visitor. 

Upon hearing the telltale signs of crackling twigs and old leaves, I moved away from the couch, stepping slowly to the side of the window as I clutched my rifle close to my chest. 

One thud, two thuds, three thuds. My heart began racing, and I forced myself to hold my breath. For a moment there was nothing, as whatever made the sounds outside my home silently peered inside. A deep groan filled the air as I took another cautious step away from the window. Out of the blackness, in flickering light, I saw burly looking fingers curl around one of the planks of wood, as the first Repeater lifted a long dead flashlight to my window. 

“Hello? Is anyone in there, I need a little help.” The man’s voice wasn’t threatening in the slightest, if anything it was slightly pitiable. There was a shakiness to it, a tiredness, like he was trying to catch his breath. I said nothing, no one had been here the night he arrived looking for help, and so no one could be tonight either. 

Knock. Knock. Knock as the man gave three soft pounds against the wood. The man peered closer to the window. I could just see his shape leering close to the window, using the free hand to hold over his eyes, lifting the dead flashlight higher through one of the cracks. No doubt he saw the candle, which of course hadn’t been there the first night either. Thankfully, that deviation was so small it meant next to nothing. 

“Hello?” Asked the man again. I kept still, my finger twitching as I fought to keep it off the trigger. One minute, two minutes, three minutes passed as the lifeless flashlight passed over and over across the window. 

“Please, I’m lost, I just need some help.” The man’s voice was soft, pleading. I did not respond, I could not respond. It may seem heartless, but he was too far gone. After a minute more, the Repeater gave up with a defeated sigh, and loudly began to stomp away from the window. I didn’t immediately return to my spot on the couch, instead waiting a few more minutes until I could no longer hear his stomping, or his defeated gasps of breath as he left. After I was satisfied, I let out the breath I was holding and sat back down, trying to force my chest to stop pounding through deep, calculated breaths. 

The next few hours were calm, save for the odd scratching and whispers asking if anyone was inside from the few people who’d found us from time to time. These Repeaters, thankfully, had not peered through the window as the first had. So, I needed only to keep my rifle at the ready, just in case something set them off. Another valuable lesson, if a Repeater has no reason to see you, don’t give it one. Stay out of its sight, don’t make a sound, don’t interrupt its routine. They’ll leave you alone. Usually. 

3:52 AM, the night was almost over, and I had only one visitor left. This last Repeater was technically our first, one we had encountered in the first few days our town became isolated. A lot of people broke down in those initial days, and most of us were too frightened and, frankly, too busy panicking  to focus on the Repeater problem. That led to a lot more of them, including the one I now had to face, the one I had to turn away. 

Taking a deep breath, I sat up from the couch and made my way to the door, checking the bolt of my rifle one last time. I was only slightly relieved to see the brass casing reflecting a soft bit of candlelight back at me. With any luck, no ammo would be spent tonight. 

If you must deal with a Repeater, try to learn exactly what their routine is, and mimic it to the best of your ability. Think of it as an acting exercise, try not to mess up, and be ready. 

Carefully stepping by the front door, I checked by the nightstand beside for the flashlight I kept there. Sure enough, there was a bright red, chunky plastic flashlight I used specially for events like tonight. Steeling myself, I slung the rifle behind my shoulder, just out of sight, and took the small twisting metal on the door knob in my hand. After a soft twist, I heard the barely discernible clicking of metal as the door unlocked. 

“Stay calm. You know what to say, what to do.” I said aloud to myself. Swinging the door open, I gently stepped outside into the cool night air, chirping crickets and cicadas quickly filling my ears as I took in the near pitch blackness of the treeline underneath the starless, cloudy night sky. I counted the seconds as I gripped the strap on my rifle tightly. 

One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six seconds. The first signs, deep breathing, panting, the cracking of leaves and snapping branches. 

“Hello! Anyone!” Came a distraught voice from the woods. Even all these years later, the pain in his voice was unmistakable. 

“Can anybody hear me?! Please, it’s my daughter!” He begged, I could see the tears on his face even before he came visible. My turn. 

“Hello? Who’s out there?” I asked, pitching my voice ever so slightly higher. The truth is, it was Sam who had been out here all those nights ago. Unable to sleep, trying desperately to reach his mom on his phone. In the distance, I saw a man stumble out of the woods and fall onto his hands and knees, huffing as he laid on the rocky road leading to the house. He was still too far away to see any features, but I could hear him panting, his breaths raspy as he desperately sucked in air. 

“Sir? Sir are you okay?” I asked with false concern. The frame of the man turned, still huffing as he stumbled up. The shuffling of rocks signified him getting closer, and I fought the urge to ready my rifle as my focus deepened, ready for anything. 

“Please, please you have to help me, it’s my daughter! One of those things got her!” He exclaimed as he stepped closer. I had no idea what the man looked like as he stopped a few feet from the steps leading up to our porch. There was only enough light from the clouded sky to reveal his shape, huffing, puffing, wheezing. 

“Those things? You mean the Repeaters?” I asked in Sam’s voice. The figure nodded frantically. 

“Yes, she got in their way and they took her into the woods! I need help, please I need to find her!” He begged. I pretended to acquiesce.

“I-I’ll go get some help, just stay there!” Without another word, I walked back to the door while keeping an eye on the figure, calmly opened it, and stepped inside. Technically, this was a deviation. Sam had been somewhat frantic that night, nearly throwing open the door as he rushed inside. His clattering had been what woke me up that night, sounds I most certainly hadn’t been making. These types of deviation are fine, so long as they don’t interrupt the Repeater, or drastically alter the events they’re trapped in. So, I grabbed the flashlight by the door, then proceeded to wait several minutes. 

I kept a close eye on the Repeater through a small peep hole as time crawled ever so slowly. Even though I was playing my part, there was no guarantee that everything around me would play out exactly the same. We were in the middle of the woods, surrounded on all sides by wild life, wild life that by its very nature was unpredictable. It’s best to keep an eye out when you have such a massive variable, one you can never fully account for. The Repeater, for his part, never deviated, following the same pattern I’d seen for years now. Exhausted huffing, placing his hands on his head and pacing as he waited outside, holding his arm periodically. 

4:01 AM, I could feel my stomach drop. Forcing myself to take a deep breath, I slung the rifle so I held it in one hand, tucked the flashlight under my arm with the other, then opened the door. I quickly shifted the flaslight to my open hand and flicked it on as I stepped outside, focusing on the Repeater. 

The Repeater, just like always, winced at the sudden light and turned to face me, holding out a dirt covered, scarred hand as he backed away slightly. His thin autumn coat was torn, ripped in several places and revealing hints of a long sleeved t-shirt. His grass stained jeans fared no better, small holes revealing scabbed skin in some places, and fresh cuts in others. Even all this time later, I pitied the man. When I’d first encountered him, his clothing had looked almost brand new, but years of reliving the worst day of his life had left them just as broken as he was. 

“Just focus… You’re almost done.” I told myself. 

“You, what did you say to my friend? Why are you even here?” I asked harshly, using my own voice this time. Like everyone else, I’d been confused and scared at the time, and on that particular night, had just experienced a sudden and unwanted awakening. If I could take back what I said, what I did, believe me, I would. Instead, I watched for the thousandth time as the man blinked rapidly, squinting as he fought against the light. His voice shook when he tried to respond. 

“I-I was just asking for help, I swear! My daughter, she was taken, I’m trying to-“ 

“At this time of night? What’s wrong with you?! You’re gonna get yourself and probably us killed!” I yelled, interrupting the man. I hated the venom in my voice, I hated the startled yelp the man let out as he raised his hands in a non-threatening gesture, pieces of fabric dangling from his arms. Most of all I hated what I’d missed all those nights ago, the sight of the man crying, barely holding it together. 

“Please, I just want-“ He tried to say, his voice trembling. Again I interrupted him. 

“I don’t care what you want, you need to leave, now.” The Repeater’s expression dropped, shaking his head in sheer disbelief and despair as he opened his mouth to speak again. 

CRASH. My heart leapt up into my throat. 

“No, no no no no…” I thought. In an instant I turned to my left, shining the beam of light towards the small gravel driveway that housed my car and our trashcans. In the light I could see both trash cans, both of which should have been standing. Instead, I could see one of them tipped over, trash spilling on the ground as a raccoon obliviously picked away at the escaping pile. My grip around the rifle tightened, and I could feel my flashlight hand begin to shiver. 

“Crap…” I thought. A deviation, and a big one. Turning back to the Repeater, I could see his expression and demeanor change in an instant. His fear, his despair, his pitiable stance were all gone. In their place I saw a hardened, almost animalistic rage in his eyes, fists clenching so tightly that I could see fresh blood dripping from where his long dirtied nails dug into his skin. His attention was divided between myself and the offending raccoon, his huffing breath turning into a heaving growl as the white in his eyes turned red. 

“Crap…” I said aloud. My mind went a mile a minute as I tried forcing myself to calm down, taking deep breaths and steadying my hands. 

“I said you need to leave, NOW.” I said in a shaking voice, trying desperately to get the Repeater to recognize his routine. The Repeater only growled louder, veins beginning to become visible in his hands and in his face. 

Without thinking I dropped the flashlight and heard it clattering to the ground as I raised my rifle, aiming at the Repeater as it became half bathed in light, half shrouded by darkness. 

“Don’t make me shoot you!” I shouted, my voice trembling as I trained my scope on the Repeater’s chest. I regretted the words as soon as I said them. This was another massive deviation. As poorly as I handled the situation years ago, I’d never threatened to shoot the man. Any chance I had now of keeping this from escalating was gone. The Repeater grit his teeth as he hissed in reply, his eyes becoming almost completely red as blood freely poured from his hands. 

Suddenly, the man roared, pouncing from a dead stop as he lept forward, screaming as he charged me at full sprint. 

“CRAP!” I yelled in a panic. 

CRACK, followed immediately by an ear shattering BANG. The shot had been both a reflex, and intentional all at once as it echoed across the formerly silent woods. Quick, easy, without thought. That’s the only way to deal with one attacking you, no mercy, no thought as to who they are or were, just rapid and decisive force. 

The shot hit the charging Repeater in the chest, the force of the round twisting his body as he stumbled and slammed into the ground. I quickly cycled the bolt, the sound of the empty brass casing hitting the wooden porch almost completely drowned out as the Repeater screamed in fury, fumbling with its hands to push itself back up. The monster rose his gaze to meet mine, its eyes practically dripping with fury as it roared, spit and blood flying from its lips as it tried to push towards me. 

A second CRACK and BANG left my ears ringing, and my head felt like it was almost splitting open from a sudden headache, a painful reminder that I’d forgotten to wear any form of ear protection. In the moment I hardly cared about that, however. My attention was focused on the man I’d just killed. His head was a mere fraction of what it was, now shattered and split partly open. Shards of his bloody skull were visible in the beam of the flashlight, and I found myself feeling sick to my stomach. 

Even knowing what he was, I felt a twinge of guilt welling up in my stomach as a wave of exhaustion swept over me. This was twice now I had killed him, I realized. Thoughts of him somehow getting better and returning to himself flooded my mind for an instant before falling away, replaced by the sight of his lifeless body. 

“I… I’m sorry…” Was all I could say as I lowered the rifle, my hearing slowly retuning to me as I took a step back. 

“Damien?! Damien what happened, are you alright?!” I heard the panicked voice of my friend shout. 

“I’m fine, Sam. I’m fine.” I lied as I cycled the bolt a second time, letting the expended round fall to the ground outside before stepping back inside, my eyes never leaving the body in front of me. Even as I closed the door, I could hear the distant sound of two more screams somewhere in the woods, more Repeaters, more people who’d gotten lost in the woods. More people who’d lost hope.

Sam and I didn’t sleep the rest of that night. Occasionally, we’d hear a rabid Repeater slamming against our windows or our door as they screamed, held our breath as they tried bashing their way in. Morning came before they could make progress, and, for whatever reason, they fell back into their routines. 

I’ll let that be the last lesson, before signing off and leaving you with this post. If you have the ability to, hunker down and hide from the Repeaters if you suspect they’ll come after you. You won’t be able to outrun them. If there’s enough of them, and believe me, make enough noise and there will be, you won’t be able to out fight them. Just hide. Hide, and pray they don’t find you. Try to fix whatever damage they do when it’s safe, then get ready to deal with them again. 

 If you have any other questions, leave them here, I guess. I’m sure Sam or myself with get to them at some point. 

Above all, stay safe, try not to give up. We don’t need more of them around here. ",2,1757523320.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,1.0,False
1ndjpc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ndjpc8/aita_for_cutting_off_my_31f_best_friend_29f_after/,AITA for cutting off my (31F)  best friend (29F) after she cheated on a man she was moving across the country to marry?,"Hello my potato comrades! This is an older story, but sometimes I still think about it and I'm ready for some judgement *cue Charlotte side cam*. 

Get ready, this could be a long one. 

For context, I met my former best friend, let's call her Kari, at work on my first day of training. We were introduced and she came off as that kind of person you meet and think, ""wow they're kind of mean"" bud end up liking and becoming besties with later on. (If you know you know).

Kari worked the shift before me so we would always chat and catch up on whatever drama happened during shift change, then eventually we exchanged numbers and started hanging out outside of work. 

She was a feisty shorter gal, who  was very intelligent and hard working. She was very guarded and had never even told a guy she loves them. She was cynical, but had a huge heart. She was the goth girl to my techno color vibes. 

On my birthday I asked if she would come hangout with me at the bar because only a couple people showed up and they started some drama amongst themselves over politics and ruined my night. She came out after her shift and we drank, karaoked until closing time, then ubered back to my apartment, and ordered Denny's breakfast at 3 in the morning. The next morning we went to get coffee hungover as hell and I knew then that I had found a really good friend. 

Later on she started dating a guy, let's call him Jake, and I instantly didn't like him. He had bare minimum ""bro"" vibes, if you know what I mean. 

The first time I met him we went to a restaurant where they were on a date. She was all dressed up and he was wearing a cut up muscle shirt with basketball shorts and socks with slides. Needless to say I was not impressed. But I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt because she was totally in love with this guy. 

Eventually, Kari told me she was going to be deployed to Africa by the national guard in a few months, and that Josh was being deployed to Kosovo a couple months after her. That would mean they wouldn't see eachother again for nearly 15 months, but she wanted to make it work. I told her I supported her decision but if he hurt her I would death glare him for the rest of his life. 

Fast forward to the deployment ceremony... I took the day off work to drive 3 hours to the ceremony to say goodbye. And guess who was a no show? You guessed it, Jake. From that moment I KNEW this wasn't going to end well and halfway through her deployment they broke up and she was heartbroken. 

He never gave her a real answer as to ""why"" so I did a little recon and it turns out he was seeing some other girl on his deployment, (I found out through a mutual friend who was deployed with him), and broke the news to her so she could get some closure. She was still holding onto hope that he'd come to his senses and take her back so I felt this was necessary. 

She came home and wasn't the same. She got an apartment, and a puppy, but her place was a depression hole if I ever saw one. She didn't even buy a couch. So I told her I'd decorate and make her place a home while she went to California to visit her family for a week. She gave me a budget of $1500 and I went full blown extreme home makeover. Couch, dining table, decorations, a custom painted mural I made for her, lights, rugs, curtains, candles, you name it I did it. She came home and was blown away, and I was so happy to give her a ""safe place"" after everything she had been through. 

However, after a few months she just kind of.... Ghosted me. I didn't want to pry, but covid was in full swing, and I knew that when she gets hurt she holds onto that pain for a long long time. So I gave her space. It was really sad, but I didn't want to force a friendship. 

One year later a get a random text from her, and then we just kind of went straight back to being best friends again. Celebrated fourth of July together, back to getting drinks and chatting, etc... I didn't quite understand what had happened but I was just happy to have my best friend back. I told her about how I ran into Jake and delivered the death glare as previously promised. She laughed and said he tried to slip back into her life but that she was honestly over it.i was very happy to hear this because screw that guy. 

Enter the tinder phase... After some time of healing, she decided to get back onto tinder and boy did she have a good time. I always cheered her on, and was happy to see her finally getting out there again. We loved having girl chats over cider tastings and I felt like my best friend was getting back to her old self. I didn't judge her in the slightest for all the dates (heck, I encouraged it lol). 

She started talking about making a change in her life, deciding if she wants to move to California to be near her family again or not, changing careers, etc. it made me sad to think about her leaving, but I could also see that she was unhappy where was currently was. I'm the type of friend to help brain storm ideas into reality so I always rooted her on and said I'd support whatever she wanted to do in life. 

Then one day she told me about a guy she was in training with 10 years prior that always said he wanted to marry her. This guy was head over heels for this girl but not in a creepy way. It was honestly pretty sweet and romantic, but she said she wasn't interested in him at the time.

I'll never forget her calling me SQUEALING when he sent her a new picture of himself, the boy had a glow up. Supet fit, tattooed, nice hair, all that jazz she was looking for. (She lifts weights competitively so she wanted to find someone who also lifts). I started to see a change in her, like her heart was opening up again HOWEVER, she hadn't seen this guy in over 10 years and he lived on the other side of the country so I was a little worried because long distance is difficult to make work. 

After maybe a few months of talking to him again, she told me that she's moving to him in a month to live with and get married. 

My flabbers were ghasted. 

I gently tried to talk about it with her, because holy shit that was fast, and impulsive. But she had made up her mind. She already broke the lease on her apartment, started packing things, put in her resignation at work, hired movers, and put her car up for sale. I know she was stubborn so I just said, okay, how can I help? 

I helped her pack and sort things, and couldn't help but feel sad. She was my one best friend who lived nearby so I would miss her a lot. But she seemed to be really in love, and excited to start a new chapter in her life so I wanted to be as supportive as possible. 

As the day for her to move got closer I asked if we could have one last girls lunch together and we planned a date and time a few days before she was set to leave. The day comes up and I spent an hour getting ready and looking my best to have one last lunch with my bestie before she goes. And I'm headed out the door to leave for the restaurant she texts me that she won't make it because the movers didn't show, and she needed to stay longer. I was pretty bummed out and she said that she couldn't reschedule. 

I was honestly pretty hurt by this, and felt like I was getting tossed to the side. She invited me over while she waited but by that point the movers showed up and it wasn't really something I'd say is ""quality time"". 

The next day she apologized, and I wished her the best of luck on her new adventure. That's when the bombshell happened.... 

She jokingly told me she had gone on a hike with some guy from tinder she use to see and had ""one last hurrah"" with him before moving across the country to get married. (They giggity-gooed).

I. Was. Speechless. 

This man she was about to get married to, who opened up his home to her, who was MADLY in love with her is getting cheated on for what... One last giggity?

If there's one thing I value above everything else it's being honest, even when the truth is hard. I said something along the lines of ""Kari... I'm sorry but that's just not right, and I can't support that. You remember how being cheated on felt, right? Why would you do that to him?"" I don't recall what I said exactly but I remember trying to be as gentle as possible.... 

Well. She went off on me. She said she's only ever been supportive of me, and would never judge me for something I did. She was cussing up a storm, throwing back all the times she's helped me or been there for me back in my face. I tried to talk civilly but it was too late. She was seeing red and I felt like everything she was doing was impulsive and reckless. I expressed my discontent with her not carving out a hard time for us to even have lunch together, but could go on a hike to screw some guy. And that I will never, ever condone cheating. 

She then told me I was ""slut shaming"" her and that I have no right to say any of that to her. She said ""I invited you over but you didn't come. And that hurt ME."" That's when I decided I was done, and typed out one final message saying goodbye. 

I basically said I can't be friends with someone who's morals have gone out the window, and who is willing to go behind someone's back like that for some self fulfillment. The friendship had turned into something that felt selfish, and sour. 

She was very upset with this, said some additional nasty, passive aggressive things and then said goodbye. We haven't talked since. 

An office she applied to work for in the state she moved to called me because I was still listed as a reference and I vouched for her work ethic (she is very intelligent and a very hard worker). When they asked me about her integrity I had to bite my tongue and just said ""she always followed work protocols to a tee."" Which wasn't a lie. 

I emailed her letting her know they had called and that I didn't say anything to discredit her and hope she gets the job. She never replied. 

So... AITA for cutting her off? Or am I just missing the version of my old best friend I'll probably never get back? 

*This happened about two and a half years ago, and it's been radio silent since.

the only 2 things im really hoping to see in the future...

folders in the dock...  i prefer to have my several messaging apps... fb, whatsapp, messages, gmail... all in one folder on the dock so i can get to what i need quickly.

tap to open folders vs tap to open app be on a folder per folder basis.  i want my smarthome folder that i have the googlehome icon for to tap and open googlehome, swipe and open a folder full of all the misc smart home apps.  on the other hand, i have all of my finance apps in a folder that i just want to click to open.

  
easy to deal with both, but im hoping to see those changes.

No flowers, no grand gestures just everyday life. But one morning, I woke up early and decided to surprise my girlfriend with breakfast in bed.

Eggs, toast, coffee the usual. I even wiped the plate edges like a pro and folded a napkin, feeling pretty proud of myself. I stacked everything on a tray and added a little note that said, “Just because.”

Then came the entrance. Her bedroom door was mostly closed, so I thought I’d make a smooth move and gently push it open with my foot while holding the tray. Big mistake.

I stubbed my toe on the doorframe, lost my balance, and the tray went flying. Coffee spilled everywhere, plates shattered, and I slipped on the egg I just made.

She woke up to the chaos, found me on the floor soaked in coffee, surrounded by breakfast carnage, and just laughed. Not in a mean way, but that warm, “I love you even when you’re a mess” kind of laugh.

She helped me up, cleaned the mess, and then made me breakfast instead.

In that moment, I realized: it’s not about the perfect gesture. It’s about trying and having someone who loves you through the spills.

I’ve had 2 in the past& I know it’s still early to test but with my anxiety, 4-6 weeks to wait to test isn’t gonna happen for me haha. So.. for about a week, every few days I’ve been using the Walmart cheapy tests (they have always been my go to, and have never had an issue with them) JUST to see if the line is fading at all, also like I have in the past. I’ve been using first morning pee and the line had stayed exactly the same. I know it’s more concentrated since I don’t get up to pee in the middle of the night. Just for funsies I took another this afternoon. My pee was not as dark as this mornings, but not clear. Ive only had 1.5 ice coffees and a small bottle of water. The line was much more faint. So should I be testing later in the afternoon like today rather than using first morning urine to track the lines? Just trying to ease my anxiety of the abortion not working 🙃 I will add my experience below for anyone curious!

As time went on, I noticed Lauren loves making other peoples drama HER drama and talking about everyone behind their back. I let it slide but always kept in the back of my head that she quite possibly could be talking to someone else... about me. I just wanted to avoid drama and any issues so I let it be. As time went on, I started to distance myself from her because she was telling my business to an assistant manager THAT WENT ON to my actual manager. We haven't seen or spoken to each other now in almost 2 months. I thought everything was going great but I recently got coffee with another coworker of mine and they informed me that Lauren was talking about me behind my back to her while also claiming that she ""missed"" me. What kind of person would say all this in one breath? I didn't know what to say or if I even wanted to address it because I just want nothing to do with her. Until.. I was called into my managers office to speak and she let me know that someone at work feels uncomfortable to work with me and feels that because we ""aren't friends anymore"" it'll be awkward. This is the second time now that I have spoken with my manager over drama I want nothing to do with and I just don't know what to do.

I just stood there. The cat opened one eye, looked at me like ""he is mine no"" and went back to sleep.

I didn’t say anything. I just made coffee and left them alone.

Writing this on my laptop instead of my phone, so you won't get all the emojis I might clutter it with otherwise. 

  
I suppose I am seeking traditionality currently. While I am interested in anyone, gender does not particularly matter to me, I guess I am after the sort of relationship that might be the idealized version of the 40's, 50's, or 60's with gender roles (I know, how non-2025 of me). Yet, I still want that modern flair in that it also doesn't matter. Okay, I will break it down.

  
As a newer homeowner, I would absolutely *love* a man (or woman) in my life whom I could trust could do house projects properly and I would feel confident and cared for. With that being said, with a confident man like that then *I* could lean into my femininity which I always hesitated to in past relationships. Think the color pink, wearing dresses, liking to bake, cutesy cottage-y stereotypical things. But here's the dilemma, I like girly men! HA. Not really, but I want you to have long hair, and if you like a women's shirt to wear it, and don't mind holding a purse (I don't even carry one, but IF I did, you'd carry it if I didn't want to). That sort of thing. BUT that means same goes for me. If I don't feel like shaving my legs, I don't. If I want to wear men's basketball shorts, I will. Like, I think just the freedom and flexibility is nice BUT I also love the ability to shift back into that norm that we often push away from in society now. Sometimes that's so dang attractive though. Like be fluid, but still go back into that? I don't know if that makes sense. ALSO, if you are a woman and can do all that ""guy"" stuff, sign me up.

  
I want to enjoy homemade pancakes with pink edible glitter on them while we slow dance to Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin records on a vinyl on a Sunday morning. I want to stroll around an arboretum wearing a long, flowy maxi dress and you have a cute polo and khakis on and we get like fancy coffees. I want to drive down the highway blasting synthwave pretending I am in an 80s movie with my hair blowing from the windows being down and we sip on Baja Blast on our way to the beach. 

  
I need someone fun. I do NOT want to be worrying about who you are snapchatting or how long it's been since you've been on Tinder. I do not want to need to think ""Oh what is their phone password?"" and feel like I need to check it when you go to the restroom because you've been distant lately. I do not want to hold myself back when I want to have a deep, philosophical conversation at 3AM again. I do NOT want to beg you to share your feelings and emotions with me. I do not want to feel like I need to try. I want to be me. I want to trust. I want you to be you. I want us to just work and make sense and there to be no confusion. 

  
That also being said, I want to take things slow. I want to have slow dates. Time apart. I do not want to live with someone else. I do not want to make plans for the future. I want to enjoy the now. I do not want children. I just want freedom and someone who *chooses* to be with me with no expectations. Simple. 

  
If you have made it through all of that, somehow, here is me. I am a person of varied interests. I am constantly making new self-improvement plans and being way too hard on myself for not delivering. I am a hard worker. I am a very often-misunderstood person. I am quiet by nature, but I have a lot of thoughts and love talking to the right person. I hope you will learn to understand me. I am a good person with a big heart. Most mistake it for selfishness. I love gaming but it is not my world. I love reading and learning and always growing. I love my pets (rabbits and rodents) and love nature. I enjoy meditating and learning Japanese when I can. I am trying to get back into playing music. Decorating my house has been most fun for me recently. I am a big YouTube fanatic. I watch just as much now as I did back in 2016 and 2012. Never gets old. I love listening to music, too. I do many things for work. I hope you find me interesting. 

  
If you are serious and have read this in entirety, please explain to me your thoughts on traditionality as I described above. Also, let me know which of my interests are most alike yours! You should add your favorite color as well, so I know you've read it in full. Please don't message me anything NSFW. ",0,1757522413.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False
1ndjbft,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ndjbft/my_roommate_came_home_last_night_i_dont_think_it/,"My roommate came home last night, I don’t think it was him.","7:07 P.M.
I sunk so deeply into the couch my body felt like it was melting into the leather that stuck to my skin. I love my lazy nights, the type where my feet forget the feel of anything other than my fuzzy socks. When I try to stop myself from eating all the ice cream I have in my freezer in a single sitting. The windows were all shut and locked and the ac blasted since my roommate finally wasn’t there to complain about the cost, but he knew he loved the cold just as much as I did. His cat laid right on the small coffee table in front of me next to the stray cheeseballs and the remote that was still out of batteries. Wilbur purred so loudly I could barely hear the faint voices on the tv. Nothing interesting is on anyway, just some random cartoons so I didn’t really mind. I just hate a quiet house. 
While I hid from the quiet that threatened to fill the room if I dared to turn the tv off, Wilbur stretched his body and curved his spine into a crescent moon around the tv remote that laid as useless as I. He stood up and pawed at the empty plastic tub of cheeseballs like he was demanding it to refill itself. “Yea buddy me too..” I muttered as my stomach growled louder than my voice. God, where the hell is Blake. I’m about to start eating Wilbur’s tuna mush if I have to wait any longer. 
The couch creaked and moaned under me as I forced myself up onto my achy feet. The dingy light in the kitchen barely illuminated the walls without the natural light coming in from the windows, but I can’t get behind the idea of the curtains being open at night. I opened the door of the fridge and my knees popped like they always do as I crouched down to see what may still remain in our tiny fridge. I was disappointed but not surprised. Soy sauce, mustard, iceberg lettuce with what was either a small rodent living on it or a large amount of mold, and a whole lot of nothing else. I should probably throw that away soon.
 I thought about showering for the first time in two days but, against my better judgement, I flopped back toward the couch. And as I walked back from the kitchen I took a detour to the front window of our house, I just need to take a peak sometimes. Some feeling down my spine always seems to remind me to rethink my safety for no particular reason. Unsurprisingly nothing was out of the ordinary. The moon shined down on our street just as it always did, onto my car with the rust and scratches that covered it, and the spot for Blake’s car just as empty as it has been since he left. Snow iced over the street, every inch of it looked perfect and fluffy Miss Evans walked her dog down the sidewalk as she always did. But I paused before my next thought. Why's Grant just waiting outside his house across the street? He’s not even moving or knocking. Whatever, Katie will let him in once she realizes he’s waiting. The only light that shined through his house and its closed door was the familiar glow of the aquarium through the window. I took a breath realizing it really is just in my head again, walking back to the couch I let myself fall right back into my spot passing out right then and there. 
	Knock. Knock.
	Two quiet almost taps came from the front door but woke me up just as much as any sound would. 
	“Hey Dev, can you let me in please. Its so fucking cold out here. The snow is really getting to me.” Blake’s voice crept in through the bottom crack in the door. 
	It took me a moment to realize I was awake and not dreaming but slowly got up realizing he forgot his key again. He hasn’t remembered to grab it all week and I’m getting sick of being woken up by him. At least I can eat now. I hobbled over to the door, my head awake but my legs were still ready for bed barely wanting to move. I cracked open the door leaving just enough room for my head to peek through and glare at him through the metal screen type door we had as extra protection in our nice old people filled neighborhood. 
	“Where’s the food Blake.” I could see his face drop from a faint smile to a frown as I blatantly demanded my meal without any first greetings. 
	He sighed before talking back, “Dev please, I’ve had a long day, I’m still getting over Chelsea and I forgot to get anything on the way out.. Please just let me in, you know I hate the cold.” I could see on his face he was tired of my bullshit. But I am not budging.
	“Chelsea broke up with you two months ago and I am fucking starving. Now you have one option here, you drive back to the store, get us some food before it gets too late and I will let you in and we can talk about your day. The store is only a few miles away, you'll be back in 10 minutes or less.” I fought back, refusing to go to bed hungry again.
	He looked pissed, pausing, staring me in the eyes just waiting for me to open the door for a second, it was a bit eerie till he spoke again, “Dev, bro, I’m freezing just standing here waiting. I’m telling you, any longer out here and my blood is going to turn into a slushie and I don’t think my veins can handle–” 
I cut him off when my mind finally caught up to the words he said, “Wait, what do you mean you hate the cold? I only just realized you said that. You and I both know how warmblooded you are. Blake, you went out yesterday in shorts and sandals.. with a foot of snow blocking our door.” 
	He exhaled sharply before just chuckling under his breath, “I don’t know Dev I just haven’t been as warm recently. Honestly can you just let me in though, I’ll grab a jacket and you can come with me and we can go eat out somewhere. I got some extra tips today at work and I can use them to get us a nice dinner, maybe we can go to a steak house or something, let’s go crazy for a night. Just a little bit couldn’t hurt.” He spoke so softly and smoothly now but he started to scratch at his cheek as he attempted to convince me. 
I caught myself staring at his hand more than his face now. The way his nails dragged over his cheek looked too casual at first, but he didn’t stop. Just a light scrape, again and again, until the skin there went red. “You’re bleeding,” I muttered, before I could stop myself.
He said so casually, “Oh shit, my skin must be dry from this weather. Fuck can you let me in I gotta clean this up.” His mouth moved before his face did, like he wasn’t reacting to the pain but my words instead. Like the blood didn’t even bother him. But his voice wasn’t convincing, and the sound of his fingernails pulling away was sharper than it should’ve been, like fabric tearing against itself, leaving a flap that slightly curled over off of his face leaving the raw red meat visible. I looked back behind me after feeling a chill down my spine and realized Wilbur was protected by the couch like a shield, hiding his body and peeked a single eye around the corner. He snickered letting the air breeze breathe through him, “You just look so damn warm in there. You gotta share a little, right?” He chuckled after like he said something funny as I stared blankly at him. “So warm. So soft.”
“Are you on something Blake? Be honest with me right now because something about this is not right. Can you just stay somewhere else tonight?” My voice was shaky as I struggled to keep my body and words steady. I was more uneasy that I’ve ever been.
He stood still staring me in the eyes like he was still just waiting for the answer he wanted and wouldn’t budge without it, “Dev,” he whispered. Softer now. So soft I almost thought I imagined it. “Don’t make me stay out here. I don’t feel like myself.” He said as he placed his face closer to the steel door. His blood left a trail on the open fence, he left a mark on his territory. 
“Blake I can’t deal with this right now, just go rent a motel for a night and I’ll pay you back, if you want to warm up so bad use the heater in your— Blake. Where’s your car?” I wasn’t even thinking before I spoke anymore, the words weren’t making sense, nothing was.  
His eyes flickered for a moment, like he had to remember the right answer, before he finally said, “I didn’t drive.”
I felt the words sink in. “You didn’t drive? Blake, it’s three miles to the store, in a foot of snow. What the fuck do you mean?” My eyes snapped to the right, quick, just a dart before shooting back to him. Left, right, left again, fast enough to keep him in my sight. But I caught it. The hook by the door. Empty. His keys weren’t there. They’re always there. He drills it into me. “Put it back, Dev, put it back, you lose it, that’s your fault.” His voice replayed in my head, smug, certain. But the hook was bare. My chest tightened and I forgot how to breathe for a second. Is he fucking with me?
Blake tilted his head against the door, slow, steady, like he knew what I was thinking. The grin didn’t move but his eyes sharpened. “What’d you see, Dev?”
I opened my fist that I didn’t even remember forming, fighting against the sweaty sticky grab of my palm and fingers. “Nothing,” I said too quickly, my voice cracking. “Nothing, man.. Just please go somewhere else.” 
Blake chuckled under his breath, low and soft, but then it stretched too long, like he was waiting for me to laugh with him. His face fell flat as he locked eyes with me still just inches from the metal, “Dev,” he whispered again, soft as the snow outside. “Please. You don’t even have to open it all the way. Just a little bit.” His face was coming apart the longer he stood there. The skin didn’t sit right on him, hanging too loose, like it had been stitched back on wrong. Every time his cheek twitched the flap tugged lower, tearing at the seams. When he smiled, it wasn’t even a smile anymore, just raw muscle showing through where the corners of his mouth had split. The sound was worse than the sight. Every shift of his expression came with a squelch, a slow peel, like pulling the raw skin from a wet piece of chicken. He tilted his head against the steel door and the skin along his temple slid half an inch out of place before catching on the bone.My stomach turned and my eyes slipped past him without meaning to. Anywhere else. Anywhere that wasn’t that. But something caught my eye in the background, somehow took my attention from this nightmare. Grant’s door was swung wide open, the empty black of his living room looked like a pitch black pit. In the midst of our quiet neighborhood somehow Grant's house seemed even more quiet. When did he go in? How long has that door been open?
Blake cut off my thoughts like he could hear them, like he was thinking with me as he looked back at Grant’s house, “What are you looking at Dev?” He spoke with a grin on his face, the peels now falling lower than they had before. 
“W-where did Grant go Blake? Did you do something to him?” I studdered, it didn’t make sense but I didn’t know what the fuck was wrong with Blake right now, what was going on in his brain. Was it breaking down just as much as his body was right now?
He gave me a condescending look and as he scrunched his eyebrows the skin between them squished like the skin was one size too big. “You've been here with me Dev.. I never moved. I guess they just let him in. He must’ve been cold.” He said without a blink or any sign of an expression other than that same fucking smile. 
The empty black across the street swallowed me whole. The snow around the porch looked untouched, no prints, no sign he’d even gone inside. The house was pitch black no window lit, not a single light, just the empty black of what lay inside. “No,” I muttered under my breath, shaking my head like I could knock sense back into it. 
His laugh came out wrong. Thin, breathy, cut in half like it didn’t belong to him. Blake whispered, “You’re the only one left making this hard Dev.” Wilbur growled again this time at the sound of his words, louder this time, and I could hear his claws scratching the floorboards as he bolted deeper into the house.
I slammed the wooden door in his face just so I could at least imagine I wasn’t in this situation. My fingers missed more times than I could count as I grabbed my phone before I heard the operator,”911, what’s your emergency?” Her voice was the first hope I’ve had since he knocked on my door.
My eyes were locked on the door as I spoke like my body was afraid he still had the key on him. Every syllable rattled in my throat as I tried to whisper just loud enough for her to hear me, “Someone’s outside my house. My roommate. He won’t leave me alone. He’s bleeding, he’s not making sense, I-I think he’s on something.”I checked through the peephole just to make sure he was still there and the sight made me sick. His face was sealed onto the metal door with his eye glaring straight into mine through the lens. For a second it looked like he couldn’t even separate himself from the shield that stood between us, until he tried to move away. He tugged once with no give before he put his hands to the door and pushed with a slow pull as his face peeled off and stuck onto the door like the masks Blake’s girlfriend used to do. The sickly red ooze that stuck kept it on pulled like strings of melted cheese still holding onto his face. The only visual left was his bare muscle and fat that laid underneath and the eyes that sat in their now visible sockets. My words were stuck in my throat so much that I had forgotten that I was even on the phone.
“Who ya talking to Dev? Can I say hi?” And then he smiled.
Honestly it wasn’t a smile anymore, no, not really.The skin was gone, but the muscle still knew the shape. His lips had been stripped away, so the grin looked wider, stretched cruelly across the exposed fat and teeth. And his face was raw and stringy like the flesh of a mango that had been freshly peeled.
“He knows I’m on the phone. Please just send someone. I think he wants to hurt me but I won’t let him in. I don’t even think it’s him anymore.” My words were shaky and my voice low. I tried to whisper so softly directly into the phone that not even I could really hear it.
“Okay just stay calm and quiet, I’m sending someone now, you’re going to be ok. Are you somewhere safe right now? Do you have something to protect yourself?” She spoke clear and calmly, the only sturdy thing in this entire situation. 
“Dev. Don’t make me freeze out here. Please.” I could still hear his smile in his voice and that he still stood just inches from the door. 
“I’m by the front door, I’m just sitting here so I can watch him from the peephole. I’m too scared that if I leave he’ll find a way in.. but I can grab a weapon or something.” We did have any weapons, we barely had silverwear. The only thing I could find as I rummaged through the kitchen was a disappointingly small steak knife. It would have to do. “I uh, found something, I have a knife now.” I paused for a second as I went to return back to the front door to keep watch, the microwave and the green glow of the time made me freeze. 10 P.M. It had already been three hours of him sitting outside. It only felt like a few minutes and an eternity combined so I guess that does even out to about three hours, but it still didn’t make sense how fast time had moved. I kept walking. 
“Can you try to find somewhere safer? Do you have a room you can get into that he can’t get into? Or somewhere you can barricade yourself into? The police are going to be there soon. Any minute.” She spoke more urgently now but still calm, she was trying to stay calm for me. But there was worry behind her voice. 
My mind flashed to the small safe room that we had set up when we first moved in, he knew the passcode when he helped me set it up, but I don't think this is him anymore. But that should be a last resort, “No I can just stay here, I don’t think he can get in.”
“Hey Dev, this glass looks really thin. I wouldn’t want us both to be cold but if you keep acting so weird I might have to find my own way in.” I didn’t hear the smile this time, and his voice sounded different, more scratchy and strained. 
She was right, without  another thought I quietly ran upstairs making sure to skip the creaky step on my way up. Every movement I made no matter how far I was from that door I still felt like I needed to be silent. He could barely talk but I somehow knew that he’d hear me if I made one mistake. He’d know that I was hiding, he’d know where I was hiding. I pushed the wardrobe aside to unveil the open room we had behind it before pulling it back behind me. Both of us were nuts, we knew we were. We’d always ask each other why we’d need a secret safe room, but we still always wanted peace of mind. I needed it today, just felt weird being in here without him. A few minutes passed, my heart seemed to calm and I felt genuinely safe. That wasn’t him out there, he couldn’t know where I am. Besides, the police are about to take care of it. How are they even going to take care of it? His- his skin was falling off like melted rubber. Can he even be saved? Can I?
“Hey are you still there?” the operator’s voice snapped through the phone, crisp and too loud in the stillness. She spooked me. “Stay with me. I’ve got two units almost on your street. You should see their lights any second now. Just stay in there ”
I held my breath, straining. For the first time all night, I heard something besides Blake’s faint breathing through the door. The sirens blared through the street, it felt wrong how loud they were through the completely quiet street. Even so, even through the sirens, even all the way up here behind this wardrobe, I felt like I could still hear his breathing. It was directly in my ear. Like he was breathing right through into my soul as it whispered its way up my spine. “They’re here,” I whispered.
She whispered back in the same second like she was anticipating those words, “Good, just stay hidden. They are going to take care of this, just let them handle this.” 
Her words seemed like the only ones I should follow, but I couldn’t. What if they came to the front and I wasn’t there.. if Blake tried something while I sat in a closet doing nothing- no. I had to see it. I pushed the wardrobe aside as quietly as I could and crept down the stairs, every step fighting against the scream in my bones telling me to stay put. Then my body screamed even louder as I forgot about the creaky stair, it squealed as I squished it under my foot. The sirens squealed louder so I kept walking. The dispatcher kept talking, asking me to just stay put and stay safe, almost begging me knowing that something more than I could handle stood outside. She didn’t know what monstrosity waited for her officers. I didn’t even know. 
Looking through the peephole felt like watching a snuff film, something I would’ve seen in middle school, part of the reason I was so paranoid for sure. Blake was still facing the door and as soon as I had a chance to see him his blank stare turned into a smile again. Tires crunching over snow. Doors slamming shut. Heavy boots. 
“Welcome back Dev! Just couldn’t stay away?” He spoke with joy in his voice like he was excited to know I was back. How did he know I was back?
Their voices sounded like an oasis in the midst of a desert. “Sir, step away from the door and put your hands where I can see them!” The authority behind his voice made me quiver. Blake didn’t flinch. I could imagine it, the scalding heat blistering my back, the sand burning my feet numb to the pain and the taste of bare flesh as my tongue begged for water. I was stuck in the desert.. and I saw no oasis. It was a mirage. 
Blake gave me one last smirk with his skinless lips and bare face. More skin had fallen off, now his arms were missing patches and his shirt was blood soaked. He turned around toward the officers with his hands comfortably above his head. The officer behind the first nearly dropped his gun at the sight of him. I couldn’t stand the sight but I couldn’t look away either. The other officer staggered, frozen, weapon shaking in his hands as he stared at Blake, who only grinned with his raw muscle and teeth. I heard his partner scream next as I was made to watch him put the gun to his head. As soon as the other officers' light met Blake he froze. Blake smiled, I could feel that fucking smile even though he was turned away from me. I could even see the muscles around the sides of his face contort to make a grin. 
“What’s happening Devin? Are you ok?” The dispatcher tried to interrupt but nothing could take my attention away. 
His hands met his throat and he clawed again, opening his thick exposed veins to the open air. Blood slowly came out in globs like a thick chocolate pudding, like it had curdled and creamed through the night into something just as sickly sweet as it was sticky and revolting. The officer was silent and unable to move an inch. Until he too raised his gun like he had seen more than his mind would let him. He pulled the trigger too, like his body didn’t want the trauma of life after this. Both bodies laid on the ground flat like two dolls that a child played with too roughly. Their open wounds painted the street and their blood filled the snow like the syrup to a snowcone. And Blake stood still, and I could only guess still smiling. 
The dispatcher spoke louder now basically yelling, I had only now noticed she was talking to me this entire time just waiting for a response, “Devin! Are you ok? What’s happening? Where are the officers? Where is the man?” I couldn’t respond to her words, I couldn’t even attempt to move my hand back up to my ear. 
Blake turned around slowly and deliberately. His face didn’t move. Why the fuck is he still smiling? What is wrong with him? Why me? Why me? Why? He was almost fully raw now. The thin layer of skin that remained scattered around his body like an unfinished puzzle curled and pulled away from the meat that still held on to the bone like he was trying to shed- shed every last piece of him that still clung on. Like he wanted to return to an empty canvas and repaint his face the way he now chose it to be— Breathe. Just breathe.
The silence was nonexistent. Filled with my quick deep breaths nearly suffocating to the amount of oxygen I took in. His controlled slow breaths matched a slower tempo to mine. Every three breaths I gave he shared one with me in unison. Like he was timing his breathing to match mine, his mouth had to be  nearly against the door with how loud it was. It sounded like a whirlwind whipped around the street, it was just his struggling lungs giving out raspy breaths. 
“Hey Dev? I’m kinda cold out here. Can you let me in? I’m almost ready for you. I just want a little bit of your skin.” My eye was still glued to the peephole as he walked closer. “Just a little bit, you can share, right?” 
The dispatcher's words caught me again as I finally got the strength back to pull the phone back in. “Devin I need you to tell me are the officers ok? What is happening?” 
“They’re dead. He didn’t even kill them. They just saw him and- I don’t know what to do.” I tried to calm myself as I spoke to her. If he wanted to break in he would’ve by now. He wants permission.
There was a pause on the phone call for an uncomfortably long time, “Devin what does he want? Has he asked you for anything?” She sounded so disappointed in the way she spoke. 
I tried to talk more quietly than I ever had, I just didn’t want him to know I was still on the phone with her, that she could still send more help. I whispered,”I-I know it sounds crazy but.. he’s asking for my skin”
She let out a sigh, not one of relief but of sorrow and grief, like she knew I had no hope. She said back stoic and calm,”I’m sorry. God help you.” The three hang up beeps haunted me, she didn’t even give me a second thought. 
“Hey Dev, you know.. I know you were up in our safe room. I can come up behind the wardrobe if you want, we can hide there until sunrise so you won’t be scared anymore.” He didn’t give me a moment to grieve the death of the only hope I had. My pulse scrambled out of rhythm, I pressed my hand against my mouth to hold in a sound I didn’t even realize was clawing its way out of me. He knew. He fucking knew. How the fuck does he know? That isn’t him.. that can’t be. Or is it? Did he catch something? Is he turning into a fucking werewolf? I squeezed my eyes shut until stars burst in the dark and forced myself to breathe slow, steady, quiet. One in, one out. He wasn’t in the house. Not yet. I repeated it to myself like a prayer, a spell, anything to keep my hands from shaking the knife right out of my grip. 
He still breathed directly into the door, I was just happy I wasn’t looking through the peephole anymore, I didn’t want to see what he had become. How far could this go?
“Or you could just give me a little bit. I’m not asking for much, you just look so damn warm.” He began to beg almost, he didn’t sound like he was demanding it, just asking and pleading. 
“Go the fuck away Blake! Just go the fuck away!” I screamed it at him. I screamed so loud it felt like I tore up my vocal cords. 
He took in a big sigh, he sounded disappointed like he expected me to greet him with open arms. We’ve never been that close, not in a long time and definitely not tonight. He coughed and then spoke so clearly,”Maybe you’re right Dev. I'll try to find somewhere else to get warm.” I could feel him pause after he spoke, waiting for me to call out to him, to beg him to stay. No, I stayed silent, not a word slipped from my mouth. He gave one last breath before I heard the snow crunching away. I watched the clock on the microwave from the door as I sat still frozen for the next two hours but it felt like it still wasn’t enough time. I couldn’t move, how could I? 
The green clock on the microwave blinked at me every few minutes to remind me I was still trapped in this grey-scaped purgatory. The minutes felt like hours and the hours like days but I didn’t move. I couldn’t. 
He’s gone. I heard him. 
Still the crunch of the snow was like a fleeting memory. So cemented in my mind but more as the same feeling of a dream after you wake up than a factual moment I had lived. It just didn’t feel true. 
It couldn’t be that easy.
The silence and the weight to the air knitted themselves into a blanket and wrapped my world in a thin blanket that couldn’t be as warm as it seemed. It couldn’t be. The house groaned with the wind, every sound had intent, a heavy weight that drove a wedge between me and my own peace. I caught myself holding my breath so long my chest ached, but I didn’t dare let the silence grow without me in it. Wilbur had taken to pacing in the kitchen, claws tapping against the tile in nervous little bursts. He’d stop, sit, stare at the back hallway like he expected someone to walk in. Then he’d dart away again, tail stiff, fur prickled along his back. I clutched the steak knife tighter, and the handle sweated with me. My palm stuck to it, tacky, slippery in the same second. It felt more like a toy than a weapon. Every time I adjusted my grip, the blade caught the green glow of the microwave, flashing at me, reminding me how thin it was. A useless thing.
My mind went numb to the time, still I heard every noise that passed by my ear but the minutes finally flew through my night. I blinked. No, fell  asleep. I must’ve. I looked back up at the green glow as my eyes shot open, 6:38 A.M.. 
The house was lighter now, faint blue seeping through the curtains, but the weight of night hadn’t lifted. It only shifted, thinner, stretched out, easier to see through but still there. The silence wasn’t gone, only different. A colder silence. One that watched instead of smothered. My whole body buzzed like I’d been holding my breath the entire time, but my chest rose and fell too fast for that to be true. I wiped at my eyes with the heel of my hand, forcing them to stay open, to focus. Wilbur hadn’t moved from the kitchen. His back was to me, his fur puffed up into a shape I barely recognized, tail twitching like a clock hand out of rhythm. He hissed suddenly, sharp and wet, the sound slicing through the stillness like glass snapping in my ears. He wasn’t looking at the front door anymore. His eyes locked on the back hallway.
I turned toward the hallway but my body tried to fight me like it knew better. My steps stuck to the floorboards, each one slow and reluctant. The house itself didn’t want me to move forward. Wilbur’s ears flattened as his eyes tracked something I couldn’t see. I followed his gaze into the shadows stretching past the kitchen, past the laundry room, toward the back door. The light outside barely touched it but I could still see the frost spiderwebbing across the glass. All the hair on the back of his neck down to the base of his spine rose. 
I felt my bones try to jump out of my own body when a mouse scurried out from the trashcan that sat by the door. Wilbur leaped and pounced onto it, taking its life as soon as it believed itself to be safe. Cruel but deserved. The mouse had no way to fight and no where to run. It was doomed as soon as Wilbur decided it was his prey for the night. Hunters are made to hunt. Prey are made to be preyed upon. I was prey. 
The back door this time  knocked for three times once more before I heard that all too familiar smiling voice. 
“Goodmorning Devin. I’ve been patient, and it’s still cold. I might just have to take it from you if you won’t let me.” 
6:42 A.M.

Tooth sensitivity can turn even the most enjoyable moments into painful experiences. Whether it's sipping a hot coffee, enjoying an ice cream cone, or brushing your teeth, sudden sharp pain can be both frustrating and concerning. Millions of people worldwide struggle with sensitive teeth, experiencing discomfort that ranges from mild twinges to intense, shooting pain.

What Causes Tooth Sensitivity?

Tooth sensitivity occurs when the protective layers of your teeth become compromised, exposing the underlying nerve endings. Several key factors contribute to this dental condition:

1. Enamel Erosion
The hard, protective outer layer of your teeth can wear down due to:
• Acidic foods and drinks
• Aggressive brushing
• Teeth grinding
• Age-related wear

2. Gum Recession
When gums pull away from teeth, they expose sensitive root surfaces. Common causes include:
• Periodontal disease
• Aggressive brushing
• Poor oral hygiene
• Genetic predisposition

Understanding Dental Triggers

Different stimuli can cause tooth sensitivity, including:
• Hot and cold temperatures
• Sweet or acidic foods
• Brushing and flossing
• Air exposure

Scientifically, tooth sensitivity happens when microscopic tubules in the dentin become exposed, allowing temperature and pressure changes to stimulate nerve endings directly.

Preventing Tooth Sensitivity: Practical Strategies

1. Gentle Oral Hygiene Techniques
• Use soft-bristled toothbrushes
• Brush with gentle, circular motions
• Avoid hard scrubbing
• Replace toothbrush every 3-4 months

2. Dietary Modifications
Reduce consumption of:
• Acidic beverages
• Sugary foods
• Carbonated drinks
• Excessive alcohol

• Fluoride treatments
• Dental bonding
• Surgical gum grafts
• Desensitizing toothpaste
• Root canal (in severe cases)

Recommended Oral Care Products

When selecting dental care products, look for:
• Toothpaste with potassium nitrate
• Fluoride-enriched mouthwash
• Soft-bristled toothbrushes
• Remineralizing agents

• Green tea
• Honey
• Coconut oil pulling
• Clove oil application

Lifestyle Factors Impacting Dental Health

About me: Age: 19 Height: 163cm, Weight: 55kg Personality type: INFP-T

Escaping a toxic family situation soon and planning to seek asylum in London (I’m from Kuwait). That’s why if things ever go beyond friendship, the person must be living in the UK and older than me. I don’t want long-distance relationships.

I used to be Muslim, but I’ve left religion. I still believe in a Creator, just not in organized faiths.

What I like & value: Honest, genuine people who appreciate feelings.

Deep talks, not shallow convos or cold replies.

Space, astronomy, music (I’m obsessed with songs), nature, rain, coffee, matcha, and sometimes video games.

People who can respect boundaries and give back the same energy.

I love when people value me as much as I value them.

What I dislike: Narcissists (stay away, I can’t stand them).

Fake, exploitative people — if I notice someone is using me, I cut them off like they never existed.

Surface-level friendships that disappear fast.

Important: If anyone tries to get close romantically: know that if I love you, I’ll get very clingy, obsessed, and stalker-ish. If you can’t handle that, better not even try.

I can be crazy and weird sometimes, and other times quiet and sad for no reason.

I’m shy in real life, and it takes time for me to feel safe enough to show my true self.

Melanie was totally out by the time I entered the room.  She couldn’t have been there for long, but I saw that Ruthy had set her up nicely with a nest of pillows in all the right places and it looked like this might be the first night in weeks that she got a decent night’s sleep.

I undressed down to my boxers and slid into bed next to my wife.  I was exhausted, but sleep was nowhere to be found, and so I lay there staring up at the ceiling wondering about the decisions that had led us there.

There had been a knot growing in the pit of my stomach ever since we’d parked the car, and it had only tightened since we’d arrived at the farmhouse.  Arthur and Ruthy were nice enough, but there was something they weren’t telling us.

If I were watching the night play out like a movie, I imagined that the twist would be that they were secretly plotting our demise, or that the screaming sounds I’d been hearing were those of their victims chained up in the large garage behind the house, but I didn’t think so.  It wasn’t that I didn’t think they were capable - I’d only just met them and had no idea what they were actually capable of - it was more that it just didn’t seem to fit.  It was the look on Arthur’s face when he asked me if I’d been with Melanie the whole time we’d been stopped there.  It was the undertone in his voice when he told whatever was outside that he was just telling me a story.  It was the story itself - what was that exactly?  Just an elderly man retelling a memory from his childhood, or was it something else?
  
A cry echoed outside the window, this one sounding like MAAAA.  It seemed more believable now that it was a bird, because it certainly didn’t sound human now that I’d had the chance to hear it without other sound pollution.

Not exactly human, anyway.

Melanie snorted beside me - the preamble to a full-on snore coming in the next few weeks, I was sure.

Another scream, this one closer, but from a different direction.  The birds were all talking to each other.

I sighed and closed my eyes, trying to will myself to sleep, even if it was for just a couple of hours.

The house was cold, probably from poor insulation and the single-paned windows.  I pulled the sheets up and turned to my side, pulling my knees up to my chest for a little extra warmth.

I was nearly asleep when I heard claws scratch the wall outside the house and my eyes flew open.  Was that the coyotes again?  Did coyotes do that?

I wasn’t sure.

I sat up and listened for more, knowing full well that in the morning I would feel silly for being as scared as I was, but also knowing that the night has a way of making monsters come out, even if they’re just the ones in your head.

A scream broke through the silence, this one incredibly loud and right outside the window.  I looked over at Melanie, expecting her to be as awake as I was, but she only stirred.
  
I got out of bed and crossed the room, throwing the curtains open hoping to scare away whatever was sitting outside.

I hadn’t expected to see a face on the other side of the glass.

I stumbled backward, tripping on my own feet and falling onto the wooden floor with a sharp THUD.

From where I lay I could see nothing but moonlight coming through the crack in the curtain, and for that I was thankful.  Had the face been that of Arthur, I would have at least understood, despite how sick it would have made me feel.  But the face I saw through the glass wasn’t Arthur, or Ruthy.

I don’t think it was even human.

Just like the sounds of screaming I had heard through the wall, it was close to being human, but still not quite right.  The eyes were too big and far apart, the mouth too wide, the nose too flat.

Could it have been my reflection? 
 
The logical part of my mind liked that answer - it liked it a lot.  I stood up cautiously, fearful that the face would still be there peering at me through the glass, but as I stood I saw that that wasn’t the case.  I could see myself in the glass, just well enough to convince myself that that’s what I had seen.

Scared of my own reflection.  Had Melanie been awake, there’s no way I would ever live this one down, but despite the noises I had just made, she still lay soundly asleep.

I closed the curtains again, taking care to ensure that not a sliver of moonlight came through them, then lay back down next to my wife.

I didn’t sleep much that night.  I don’t think I would have regardless, given the intermittent screams and cries coming from just outside my bedroom window, but every time I closed my eyes I could see the image of the face that was looking back at me through the glass.  A circus fun-house image of a human face, burned into my retinas like the flash of a camera lens.

I must have fallen asleep at some point, because I opened my eyes to find rods of sunlight cast from the window into the bedroom.  Melanie was stirring, which meant soon she would be awake and in the bathroom.  I checked my phone - still no service, but it reported the time to be just before six.  

I got out of bed and got dressed, determined to get out of there as soon as Melanie was ready.  The image from the night before had dulled by then, and although the memory still gave me the creeps, the logical part of my brain had daylight on its side and by the end of breakfast I would have myself convinced that it had been my reflection in the glass.

I quietly opened the door and stepped out of the bedroom.  The scent of coffee wafted through the air, although I didn’t hear anyone moving around the house just yet.  I made my way to the kitchen, expecting to find either Arthur or Ruthy sitting down at the table enjoying a mug, or at least a full pot of coffee with a timer that had gone off.  Instead I found two empty mugs of coffee and a half pot sitting on the burner.

I didn’t have time to wonder where they had gotten off to, because I heard Ruthy’s voice in the yard calling to Arthur.

I peeked out of the window to see Arthur’s truck backing up toward the large garage.

“Was it just the one?” she called to him over the sound of the truck’s engine.

Arthur turned off the truck, stepped out of the driver’s seat, and came around to the bed where he had two large iron poles sticking out over the back.

“No, it was two this time,” he said.  “Got a one-mile one and a half-mile one now.”

He dropped the tailgate of the truck and the two metal poles clattered loudly.

“They’re getting more clever, Ruth,” Arthur said, hoisting the large street signs out of the back of the truck and carrying them to the shed. “It was only the one sign with the Pruitt’s, and I don’t even know where they’re getting these things.  Probably off some stretch of the road around here.  We’re going to have to do something about it sooner or -”

“Don’t  you say such a thing,” Ruthy said sharply.

“I know, I know,” Arthur said, putting his hands up.  “I’m sorry.  I just don’t like cleaning up their messes is all.”

“Well take it up with them,” Ruthy said.  “He’s your-”

Arthur looked up fiercely at her and she didn’t finish her sentence.  “He may be yours, but he ain’t mine,” he growled.  “Mine’s out under the apple tree.”

The couple walked around toward the door and I quickly slipped back to the bedroom.

Melanie was sitting up.  “Hey Matt, what time is it?”

“I don’t know,” I said.  “Somewhere around six I think.  We should get going though.”

Melanie stretched.  “Yeah,” she said through a wide yawn.  “That’s probably a good idea.  How’d you sleep?”

“I slept great,” I lied, knowing that the truth would surely cause questions that I’d rather not answer just then.

“Me too,” she said, scratching the back of her head. “Best night’s sleep I’ve had since I got pregnant.  Let me pee, then I’ll get dressed and we can go.”  

I agreed, trying not to sound too eager with the rising sense of unease filling my gut.  She got out of bed, donned a robe that I assume Ruthy had given her the night before, and padded her way to the guest bathroom across the hall.

Arthur had gotten up earlier this morning to collect the street signs we had seen the night before - that much was obvious.  What wasn’t so obvious was why.  Who had put them there?

The elderly couple returned from outside just as Mel was coming back from the bathroom.

“Oh,” Ruthy exclaimed.  “I didn’t think you two would be up for at least another hour or so.  Let me get breakfast on.”

“That’s alright,” I said, “we really should get back on the road anyway.”

“I have coffee on already, so at least take a cup to go with a couple of blueberry muffins I made the night before last.”

I opened my mouth to politely decline, but Mel beat me to it.  “I don’t think I can look at a blueberry right now,” she said, followed by a dry heave.

The woman nodded knowingly, “just fine then.  How about you?”

I shook my head.  “I’m not much of a breakfast person,” I told her.

“Alright,” Ruthy said, drawing the word out like she was talking to children.  “But if you leave this house hungry, it’s your own fault.”

She went into the kitchen presumably to get her own breakfast started, and Melanie went back to the bedroom to collect her things, but Arthur lingered with me in the hallway.

“Your wife get morning sickness a lot?” he asked after a silence that felt like an eternity, broken only by the sound of Ruthy’s movements in the kitchen.

“She did at first,” I told him.  “This is the first time in a while though.  The road trip is probably taking a toll I think.”

Arthur nodded slowly.  “Yeah, probably.”  Then, after another long pause.  “You said you were with her the whole time, right?  Ever since your car broke down?”

“Yeah…” I said slowly.  “Why?”

He shook his head, as if that told me all that I needed to know.  

“Alright, Matt,” Mel said, opening the door behind me. “I’m ready when you are.”

“I’ll get my keys,” Arthur said.

The ride back to the car was quiet and uneventful.  Mel waited in the passenger seat, resuming her quest for a comfortable position, while I popped the hood and went to work connecting the two batteries to each other to start the car.

To my relief, the car started on the second try.

“Thank you for everything,” I told Arthur as I slammed the hood of the car down.  “Last night would have been much worse if it wasn’t for you and your wife.”

I offered my hand out for him to shake, which he took with the leathery grip of a man who had spent his whole life working with his hands.  

There was another look in his eye then, as we stood on the shoulder of the road shaking hands, that told me there was more that he wanted to say, but something even then was holding him back.

We loosened our grip and just before I could turn away, Arthur stopped me.

“Hold one a minute,” he said.  “I’ve got something for you from Ruthy.”

He went to the cab of his truck and returned with a dilapidated cardboard box.  “Some clothes for your little one.  It ain’t much, but we won’t get any use out of them.”

I took the box and thanked him, doubting that we’d ever use them, but feeling that if I refused he would insist and I would still leave with the box.

“Thanks Arthur,” I said.

“One more thing,” he said before I could turn around.  His voice got quiet when he spoke, just above a whisper and far too quiet for anyone other than the two of us to hear.

I looked up at him and frowned, searching his face for the joke that wasn’t there, nodded uneasily, then said goodbye.

Arthur stood in the middle of the dirt road, waving broadly at us from the rearview mirror as his silhouette disappeared into the dust kicked up by our tires.

1ndj367,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ndj367,Week 37: Northern - Compass Tart and Treasure Map Tuile,"Over the past couple of months I’ve got really into Blue Prince, an amazing mystery/puzzle/strategy game which involves drafting rooms in a mansion. It’s a really amazing game, but hard to talk about without giving any spoilers! It has an obvious goal: find the elusive 46th room, but there are still big mysteries to be solved after this, and at 100 hours I’m still not quite finished…

One item found in the game is the Compass – an item which increases your odds of drafting North-facing rooms. I think this is why, when the theme of Northern was announced, my mind went straight to a making some kind of compass-related dish. I toyed with lots of ideas relating to a compass but in the end went quite literal and conceptual and so I’ve made a compass with a treasure map, but in dessert form. So here is my chocolate, espresso and almond compass tart with a treasure map tuile.

My plan was to make a [chocolate pâte sucrée](https://www.theflavorbender.com/chocolate-pate-sucree-recipe/) tartelette, fill it with something, and then top it with a dark chocolate compass disc (using a silicone mould). I accidentally started baking without checking the stock levels of my ingredients, and when it came to adding the cocoa powder, I realised I only had about 5 grams. On a whim, I decided to experiment and replaced the rest of the cocoa with instant espresso powder and added some almond extract. I quartered the recipe, so ended up using about 9 grams of espresso. I filled the shell with almond Chantilly cream (just whipped double cream, almond extract and icing sugar) and topped with my decorated chocolate compass.

My treasure map tuile was highly experimental and involved a fair few trials. The one that worked best was filo pastry which was brushed with coffee before baking, then I used more coffee, edible gold paint and melted chocolate to add details. In some ways this worked a little too well – I wanted this to look like old parchment, and whilst it was cooling the tuile started curling up. I think this adds a nice effect but did make it hard to photograph the detailing.

This strange, experimental dessert turned out to be one of the best things that I’ve made this year. I absolutely loved the flavour of the pastry, and it worked so well with the Chantilly and the chocolate topper. The tuile is technically edible but that part was less delicious because it has absolutely no sweetness, so was very bitter. I think it would work with sweetened coffee, so it has potential… ",16,1757521913.0,52weeksofcooking,4,0.94,False
1ndj34n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ndj34n,Ötztal (Sölden and Vent) 4d3n hut-to-hut hike report,"Hi, below is a hiking trip report to Ötztal, specifically Sölden and Vent, done in the first week of September 2025. (The writing has been edited for grammatical accuracy and clarity with the help of AI)…

I was looking for a hut-to-hut hike in Europe that could be done in a week or less—something with the appeal of the Tour du Mont Blanc (TMB) I did last year, but more compact. After looking into areas like Berchtesgaden and Zugspitze, I ended up choosing the Ötztal Alps based on an old Tripadvisor post. The key draw was the use of cable cars to quickly access high-altitude trails—a different approach than the TMB’s continuous walking.

Here’s how it went.

---

Day 1
We drove from Frankfurt early to catch the last cable car up to Rettenbachjoch. We’d originally thought to park at Freizeit Arena and take the bus, but timing didn’t work, so we drove straight to the cable car. Parking was allowed and straightforward, though not cheap—€29 per person including the ascent and road toll. The Gletscherstrasse, where the cable car is located, is the second-highest paved road in Europe and was used in a James Bond film. From the mid-station, we hiked about an hour and fifteen minutes to Braunschweiger Hütte. The trail was steep and rocky in parts, so we took it slow.

Day 2
We hiked back to the car by 7:30 am and drove to Vent. After a quick coffee break, we took the Wildspitze chairlift up and began hiking toward Breslauer Hütte. We arrived around 1:00 PM—much earlier than expected. Since Breslauer’s bookings are handled directly via email (not through the DAV system), we were able to cancel without penalty and decided to continue on to Vernagthütte. The extra three hours took us through some dramatic passes, and we even saw a helicopter resupply for construction at the hut. Dinner was knödel soup and bergsteigeressen.

Day 3
The morning was foggy. We hiked the whole way to Hochjoch Hospiz in low visibility, arriving around 11:00 AM. Canceling our reservation there would’ve cost €30 per person, so we decided to stay. Not long after, it started to hail and then snow. We ended up spending the afternoon in the hut while local shepherds took shelter with their sheep downstairs—part of the seasonal transhumance movement. That evening, we shared a table with a group from Garmisch-Partenkirchen. We talked about hiking, schnapps, and my past trip to Borneo. They mentioned they were heading to Rifugio Bella Vista the next day, which got us thinking.

Day 4
The weather cleared up. We decided to skip the descent to Vent and instead hike to Rifugio Bella Vista—just for coffee and cake—then turn back toward Vent. It ended up being a long day: 27 km and about 7 hours of walking, mostly downhill. After retrieving our car in Vent, we drove over Timmelsjoch Pass (€20 toll) to Bolzano.

Days 4–5
We’re interested in archaeology, so we visited the South Tyrol Museum to see Ötzi the Iceman. The exhibit was detailed and impressive—well worth the stop.

Post-trip thoughts

· The first night at Braunschweiger Hütte felt separate from the rest of the trip. Focusing around Vent from the start would’ve been smoother.
· We considered continuing toward Martin-Busch-Hütte over the Saykogel, but it’s marked black and requires solid mountain experience. Maybe next time.
· We swapped a planned hike from Obergurgl to Ramolhaus for the Bolzano visit and didn’t regret it.
· After meeting the guided group, I wondered whether using a tour operator might simplify logistics and open up more route options.",17,1757521910.0,hiking,0,0.96,False

TLDR: 18:6 Intermittent fasting works great for me. I cut all processed carbs and sugars, and I highly restrict foods that are predominantly carbs like rice and potatoes. I focus on my weeks calorie count, not daily. I cut out alcohol.

In May I was 250 pounds, the majority of my wardrobe was too small and I couldn't look in a mirror. I started counting calories, I estimated my calorie expenditure at 2300, my initial plan was 1500 calories during the work week and 2300-2600 on my days off.

Within two weeks I shed some water weight and lost a little fat, 242 on the scale, but I knew that wasn't indicative of a realistic pace.

Night time cravings were difficult.

I realized I'm simply not hungry in the morning, and I didn't get hungry until around noon, I told myself I wasn't going to eat after dinner, so I functionally was intermittent fasting and decided to roll with that. 

In July I started intermittent fasting with an eating window of noon to 8pm at the absolute latest. July 19th I broke the 240# line and was 239#.

July 24th I went to yearly physical and found out my A1C was in prediabetic levels. That scared the crap out of me. I did a lot of reading on blood sugar and insulin.

I tightened my intermittent fasting to noon to 6 during the work week and kept noon to 8 on my days off. I also cut all high carb foods out during the work week and became mindful of foods glycemic index on my days off.

At this point my weight started dropping incredibly consistently.

This last part might be a little controversial. I stopped counting calories on my days off. I  take my wife and kids out to eat, I splurge a bit. I still stay very mindful of my carb intake and I don't binge like I use to.

The flip side of that coin, and the part that people might take issue with is after my two days off I don't eat the first day of my work week, at all, I do a 40 hour fast, water, black coffee, plain tea.

I then roll back into my routine which is currently, 1500-1600 calories 3 days, 2000-2300 calories one day, realistically simply under 3000 calories 2 days (I probably average 5000 calories over those two days) and... 0 calories 1 day.

I don't crave carbs anymore, I don't have late night cravings, I don't feel ""hangry"" from low blood sugar, ""food noise"" has all but disappeared, and I more energy during the day and just generally feel better.",0,1757521747.0,loseit,0,0.5,False

I am frustrated that the G9ii totally misses focus a lot more frequently than I would expect, in what should be absurdly easy situations. I shoot in iA mode and I expected much better of the face/eye detection. Is this user-error of some kind or does the face-detection just suck?

In this case the focus point seems to be on the tree over the guy's shoulder on the right side of the image, above the coffee cup. I wish this were an isolated incident, but in my photos from the last several events where I've used the G9ii, there several incidences of exactly this kind of focus miss at each event.

My typical use of the camera is to half-press the shutter and look for the yellow box indicating that the camera has detected a face, and to release and try again if it hasn't. But obviously sometimes I don't notice, or the moment has passed. Seriously, why does it ever decide to focus on the background in scenes like this?

Hobby Space: I like to fix things mostly tech which I do at my desk but i have a lot of tools and such attached to the wall

I also have a 3D printer which I need to put somewhere its doesnt take of a ton of space

Video Games/Movies/Sports: I have a 75 inch TV and a surround sound system for this space also hoping to fit in a love seat or two smallish theater style chairs

Was also thinking maybe another standing desk that could double over as a coffee table in front of the chair I could use for larger projects that don't fit on my office desk that may not work due to size constrains though.

I am open to cool design ideas and lighting I am open to painting and removing the wall trim etc. (I do plan to keep the black rubber flooring)

During my first internship I was stationed in Houston, though I had the chance to visit Chicago a few times for work — and I absolutely fell in love with the city.

Even though it’s still a little far out, I’m already starting to look at housing for the summer so I can get settled before things get busy. Right now, I’ve found two options I really like, both around $2,200/month (expensive but short term furnished leases seem to be). 

	•	A large garden unit in Wrigleyville, just a block north of Wrigley Field and a couple blocks south of the Sheridan stop. It has a bonus small room that would be good for friends or family visiting. I also love how close it is to the lake and Lincoln Park. This is my preferred choice, the only thing I’m a little nervous about is how hectic the place may get on game days. I won’t have a car, and I don’t mind a bit of rowdiness, but are the trains normally super busy for the average 9-5er?

	•	A coach house in Bucktown, near Damen and Armitage. It’s a bit smaller with no extra space for visitors. I never visited this neighborhood, but from research I like the cool, local vibe and the coffee shops, restaurants, and easy access to the 606 trail. Plus, being right by the Blue Line would give me a more direct and potentially shorter commute downtown.

A little bit about me, I’m 21F, and I enjoy coffee shops, greenery / parks, and “speakeasy” style bars and pubs. I’m looking to move to Chicago after I graduate. I’ve visited Logan square, Gold Coast, Lincoln park, old town, etc. My favorite by far was Lincoln Park with Logan Square as my least (maybe due to construction and it didn’t seem as green).

1ndivqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1ndivqt/why_should_cold_brew_fans_try_the_best_vinci/,Why Should Cold Brew Fans Try the Best Vinci Coffee Maker,"Testing out the VINCI E23010 Express Cold Brew Coffee Maker has been quite an adventure, especially for someone who ranks cold brew coffee right up there with oxygen. I’ve used a fair share of coffee makers over the years, but this one truly offers something distinct. The VINCI Express Cold Brew makes bold promises, like brewing cold coffee in minutes rather than the agonizing 12-24 hour wait. Naturally, my inner skeptic made me question whether it could actually deliver, but after putting it through the wringer, I found the experience to be both satisfying and occasionally surprising.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Straight out of the box, the first thing that struck me was the sleek, modern design. The glass carafe paired with the black accents oozes elegance and wouldn’t look out of place in a minimalist kitchen or office. Its compact size—7 inches deep, 4 inches wide, and 12 inches tall—means it fits nicely on any counter without hogging valuable real estate. Plus, the glass exterior ensures you can always keep an eye on your coffee brewing progress. While the build does feel sturdy, I will say the unit isn’t the heaviest, weighing just 3.1 pounds. This makes it highly portable, but there’s a slight tradeoff in durability compared to heftier machines.

**Ease of Use and Cleaning**  
For someone like me who prefers coffee over complex user manuals, this machine was a dream come true. It’s fully automatic, and the interface is incredibly intuitive, with simple dials and buttons clearly labeled. After using this machine daily for weeks, I still appreciate how effortless it is to get a delicious brew. However, the real champion feature here is the self-cleaning function. Cleaning coffee makers is an often-overlooked chore, and the Vinci eliminates the hassle with its built-in cleaning mode. A push of a button flushes out coffee residue and freshens up the brewing path. Simple, efficient, and hygienic—it doesn’t get better.

**Good Points**  
• Fast brewing eliminates the 24-hour cold brew wait time.  
• Four strength settings offer flexibility: light, medium, bold, or extra bold.  
• The self-cleaning feature is a lifesaver.  
• Compact and stylish design complements any kitchen or office space.  

[Check VINCI E23010 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b084l54spy/)

**Performance and Versatility**  
Unlike traditional cold brew systems, this electric coffee maker uses Vinci's patented Circle Flow technology. What does that mean for us, the coffee drinkers? It ensures a smooth, bold, and virtually sediment-free brew, something that’s rare in cold brewers. I tested all four strength settings over several weeks and found each one to be fairly customizable to personal taste. Light brew is great if you’re someone who prefers a mellow flavor, while the extra bold option (my personal favorite) packs a rich punch for those mornings when sleep-deprivation hits hard. I also like how the carafe can double as both a brewing container and a storage pitcher, making it convenient for keeping leftover coffee in the fridge for up to 10 days.

**Flaws**  
• The reusable filter does a decent job but requires extra effort to get it fully clean after multiple cycles.  
• It only brews 1.1 liters (37 oz.) at a time, which might not be enough for households with multiple coffee lovers.  
• Despite its fast brewing time, the machine is a bit noisy during operation.    

**Product Comparisons**  
This machine squares off well against traditional cold brew makers like the Takeya and OXO Brew. The Takeya is cheaper and works without electricity, but it doesn’t come close to the speed or smoothness of Vinci’s brew. OXO Brew, on the other hand, offers a similarly robust flavor profile but needs overnight brewing and isn’t as user-friendly. However, one area where Vinci lags slightly is in batch size; OXO’s larger models cater better to heavier coffee drinkers. If portability and quick results matter more to you than quantity, this coffee maker clearly has the edge.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Price-wise, this coffee maker falls into the mid-tier category compared to other brewers, and honestly, the advanced brewing features justify the investment. The time saved from ditching the traditional overnight brew process felt priceless on busy mornings. Considering its durable design, convenience, and ability to customize brew strength, it's a smart purchase for people who invariably find themselves going to coffee shops to satisfy their cold brew cravings. However, if you’re looking for a machine that can churn out massive quantities in a single session, you’ll have to weigh whether its compact capacity aligns with your needs.

1ndivir,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ndivir/oxo_rapid_brewer_for_filter_style_coffee/,Oxo Rapid Brewer for filter style coffee,"I picked up an Oxo Rapid Brewer after reading the hype over it and the soup shot thing and just to generally see if I might prefer it as a travel brewer over my trusty Aeropress. 

The soup shots are good, but I prefer a full cup of coffee.

With the Aeropress, I usually do the Coffee Chronicler 400g no bypass recipe, which is pretty good--not as good as a cup from the V60, but more than satisfactory. 

Anyway, I just applied the recipe to the Oxo and the results were good, and this was just a first try so I'm sure the recipe could be dialed in further.

What I did:

* boiled 410g of water
* ground 25g of coffee (5 on my K-Max)
* did an Aeropress filter sandwich
* poured in 200g of water and pushed it through after slowly saturating the puck
* poured in another 200g of water and pushed it through

I think I'm going to try grinding finer next time, but overall I'm pretty pleased with the results.",5,1757521460.0,pourover,7,0.86,False

Winter in India, spanning from December to February, offers a magical blend of experiences. While the northern regions transform into snowy wonderlands with temperatures dipping below freezing, the southern and western parts enjoy mild, pleasant weather ideal for exploration. As of 2025, India remains a top destination for travelers seeking adventure, culture, and cuisine. This guide covers everything from preparation tips to must-visit spots, especially tailored for foreigners planning self-drive adventures or winter expeditions. Whether you're chasing snow in the Himalayas or soaking up sun on Goa's beaches, winter is prime time to discover India's diversity.

# Preparing for Your Winter Trip to India

Traveling to India as a foreigner requires thoughtful planning to ensure a smooth and safe journey. Start with the basics: secure an e-Visa online well in advance, as processing can take up to 72 hours, and carry printed copies along with your passport. Travel insurance is essential, covering health emergencies, trip cancellations, and adventure activities like skiing or trekking.

Packing wisely is key due to India's varying climates. For northern areas, layer up with base layers, a fleece, and a sturdy winter jacket; temperatures in places like Ladakh can drop to -20°C. In the south, light jackets or shawls suffice for cooler evenings. Comfortable walking shoes, scarves for temple visits, and sun protection are must-haves everywhere. Don't forget a basic first-aid kit, prescribed medications, and adapters for India's Type D and C plugs. Women travelers should opt for modest clothing like long skirts or pants to respect cultural norms, especially in rural or religious sites.

Health precautions include vaccinations for hepatitis A, typhoid, and rabies if venturing into remote areas. Drink bottled water, avoid street food if you have a sensitive stomach, and use mosquito repellent in warmer regions. Adjust to the pace—India can be chaotic, so embrace flexibility and avoid rushing. For first-timers, consider starting with a small group tour before going solo. Finally, download offline maps and translation apps, as English is widely spoken but not universal.

# Best Places for Winter Expeditions

Winter expeditions in India range from thrilling adventures to serene escapes. For snow enthusiasts, head north: Zanskar in Ladakh offers frozen river treks like the Chadar Trek, where you walk on ice amid stunning canyons. Auli in Uttarakhand is a skier's paradise with Asia's longest cable car and powdery slopes. In the south, Munnar's tea estates in Kerala provide mild-weather hikes through rolling hills, while Chikmagalur in Karnataka is perfect for coffee plantation treks and wildlife spotting.

Desert expeditions shine in Rajasthan's Jaisalmer, where camel safaris under clear winter skies reveal golden dunes. The Rann of Kutch in Gujarat hosts salt desert walks and birdwatching, with the white landscape glowing under the full moon. For coastal adventures, Goa's beaches offer water sports like parasailing in balmy weather, while Kerala's backwaters allow serene houseboat cruises. These spots are less crowded in winter, making them ideal for immersive expeditions.

# Top Mountain Places to Explore

India's mountains come alive in winter, offering breathtaking vistas and adrenaline-pumping activities. Shimla in Himachal Pradesh, the former British summer capital, features colonial architecture blanketed in snow, with toy train rides and ice skating. Nearby Manali is a hub for paragliding, river rafting (if not frozen), and visits to Rohtang Pass for snow play. Gulmarg in Jammu & Kashmir boasts world-class skiing on Asia's highest gondola ride, surrounded by pine forests.

For offbeat vibes, Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh offers monastery treks amid Himalayan peaks, while Mukteshwar in Uttarakhand provides serene hikes with apple orchards and panoramic views. Leh-Ladakh, though cold, allows frozen lake explorations and stargazing in crystal-clear skies. Sonmarg in Kashmir is a hidden gem for winter walks through meadows turned snowy fairylands. These destinations are best visited with guided tours for safety in harsh weather.

# Winter Special Foods to Try

Winter in India is synonymous with hearty, warming dishes that celebrate seasonal produce. Indulge in gajar ka halwa, a sweet carrot pudding simmered in milk and ghee, garnished with nuts—perfect for dessert lovers. In Punjab, sarson ka saag (mustard greens curry) paired with makki ki roti (corn flatbread) is a rustic staple, rich and buttery. Gujarat's undhiyu, a mixed vegetable casserole with beans and potatoes, is slow-cooked underground for earthy flavors.

For non-veg options, try Kashmiri rogan josh, a spicy lamb curry with yogurt and saffron, or South Indian pepper rasam, a tangy soup to ward off colds. Don't miss hot chai spiced with ginger and cardamom, or warming stews like rajma (kidney beans) in North India. In winters, street foods like hot jalebi (syrupy fritters) or aloo tikki (potato patties) provide quick comfort. These dishes are freshest at local markets or homestays.

# Preparation for Long Drives as a Foreigner

Long drives in India can be exhilarating but demand preparation, especially in winter with fog and slippery roads. Foreigners need an [International Driving Permit India](https://www.e-itca.org/international-driving-license-india) (IDP) alongside their home license, valid for one year. Rent from reputable companies like Zoomcar or Avis, opting for SUVs with good tires for mountainous terrains. Check the vehicle thoroughly: oil, brakes, battery, and spare tire before starting.

Drive defensively—Indian roads mix traffic, animals, and potholes. Stick to highways, avoid night driving due to poor lighting, and honk to communicate. In winter, carry chains for snowy areas, antifreeze, and emergency kits with food, water, and blankets. Start early (around 4 AM) to beat traffic, take breaks every 2-3 hours, and use apps like Google Maps for real-time updates. Adapt gradually; practice on quieter roads for 3-4 days if new to left-side driving. Always carry car papers, visa, and cash for tolls.

# Best Places and Routes for Self-Drive in Winter

Self-driving lets you uncover India's hidden gems at your pace. The Golden Triangle (Delhi-Agra-Jaipur) is beginner-friendly, with smooth highways showcasing the Taj Mahal, forts, and palaces—ideal in winter's mild weather. Rajasthan's loop from Jaipur to Udaipur via Jodhpur offers desert drives, lakes, and heritage sites under clear skies.

For scenic beauty, the Bengaluru to Ooty route winds through misty Nilgiri hills, tea gardens, and wildlife reserves. In the north, Delhi to Manali via Chandigarh features Himalayan views, but watch for snow; it's thrilling for experienced drivers. The Chennai to Pondicherry coastal drive along the Coromandel Coast includes beaches and French colonial vibes. Hyderabad's Deccan trails to Badami and Hampi reveal ancient ruins amid pleasant winter air. These routes are safer in winter with less rain, but fuel up frequently and plan stops at dhabas (roadside eateries).

# Best Festivals to Attend During Winter

Winter festivals add vibrancy to your trip. The Rann Utsav in Kutch (November-March) features folk dances, crafts, and camel rides in the white desert. Nagaland's Hornbill Festival (December 1-10) showcases tribal cultures with music, sports, and traditional feasts. In January, Lohri in Punjab involves bonfires, dancing, and sweets to celebrate harvest.

Pongal in Tamil Nadu (mid-January) honors the sun god with rice dishes and cattle decorations. February's Nagaur Cattle Fair in Rajasthan is a lively market with camel races and folk performances. Christmas in Goa and New Year's in Mumbai offer beach parties and fireworks. These events provide cultural immersion—book accommodations early as they draw crowds.

India's winter promises unforgettable memories, from snowy peaks to festive vibes. With proper preparation, your expedition—whether by self-drive or guided—will be rewarding. Safe travels!",1,1757521354.0,solotraveler,0,1.0,False
1ndir2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/thescottishimposition/comments/1ndir2b/why_i_need_luxury_items_and_the_weirdness_that_is/,"why i ""need"" luxury items and the weirdness that is my body -> ⚠️❗📣 TW: despair speak","~~~~

still starting out my day and feel like having a mini-ramble about a something that has crossed my mind a few times over the past few days.


so, what ""luxury"" items am i referring to in the title and why do i ""need"" it?
  
first:
   coffee.
i have severe adhd and therefore require stimulants
 the catch?
  i am caffeine sensitive
  
early 2024 i weaned myself off of my daily coffee as some close friends/family had repeatedly chastised me for drinking as much caffeine as i sometimes do.
  seriously, the amount of shaming i have experienced in my life is truly incredulous now that i look back at it. but those are more stories for later...
 it was unintentional at first, as i had things going on then which left me in a place where i just didn't make my coffee. 
   considering the shaming/criticism i often face, i decided to use it as an opportunity to detox myself from most of my caffeine intake -> i did sometimes drink caffeinated tea, but that's typically less caffeine than coffee.

 ya'll...
this lack of caffeine from coffee landed me in a deeper depression than i had already been in at that point
  it was baaaaaaaad
    the ""why do i have to exist"" with the inability to properly function levels of bad

with my bipolar type 1 diagnosis i have to be extraordinarily careful when it comes to anti-depressants. those shits turn me manic like nobody's business
  
   so i worked with my psych, i worked with my therapist
all the meanwhile wondering where this deeper depression had come from and why the meds my doctor had me on were just not having a positive impact.
 one day i realized the change had begun after i discontinued drinking coffee
   ↪️  to note, neither my doctor nor my therapist even thought to question my dietary changes...

so, as a self-experiment, i began to drink coffee again.
   wouldn't ya know, my depression was alleviated


 so i now know that my body requires coffee in order to properly function
but coffee is a luxury item in societal standards...
   and it's not available when visiting food pantries

i'm running low on coffee again [grounds i brew at home, not that k-cup shit], uncertain if i'll be able to acquire more any time soon
  ↪️  this means i'm likely going to have to mooch off of still-husband if he will so allow. he is quite understandably upset with still having to support me for the length of this year with little to nothing in return for him


my other luxury medications are an issue for me too:

i currently have 2 nicotine vapes i am alternating between [2 separate flavors]. this stimulant also treats my adhd.
  ↪️  to note, part of me detests that i smoke, part of me thoroughly enjoys it
  i have, and can, go for extended periods of time as a non-smoker [as in years]. at this time i am not confident i'm in a place to quit smoking as my stress levels are astronomically high.

   i have no marijuana rn and i am significantly struggling with that, too.
▶️ another luxury item
 please note, i do not mean this in terms of substance abuse withdrawal -> especially considering withdrawal is not something that is truly associated with marijuana.
i mean this in terms of marijuana being medicinal for me and my body and the lack of said medication.

my mindscape has been very wonky this past week and i am truly struggling to maintain focus, inspiration, and general mental clarity.
  it also doesn't help that my attempts to be a vendor last week all but flopped largely due to the weather and other circumstances, meaning i have zero income.
   
  as it stands now,
▶️ i'm almost entirely off my medicinal marijuana, having only what is shared with me when i am out at the bar
▶️ i am almost out of coffee and fearful of what may come should i lose this ""medication"" too
▶️ my nicotine vapes are a few days old now and are running low. should i be unable to acquire more that will push me into withdrawal and very probably pull out some of my mania, which will only makes things that much worse for me


being off prescription meds since early this year has taught me a great deal about my body and what i need to survive
  as i write this particular sentence, i am now crying because of the level of fear i'm experiencing.

i do not WANT to be this way
 i do not WANT to have these crazy requirements for my body
  i cannot HELP myself without income to acquire these items
   i cannot HELP myself when my body is out of tune due to missing medications and the hell that comes with that

but fuck it,
 i'm about to be homeless
   who cares about me?

as someone who actively speaks with the homeless who are frequently around my bar
  i know how truly little most people care to help the homeless, nevermind actually help them
 i have seen it with my own two eyes time and time again


some people choose homelessness
  i am not one of them
 though i am about to be forced into it in spite of my many efforts


why am i afraid of being homeless?
  because that shit is going to literally kill me
 i mean seriously, who is going to pay close enough attention to a homeless person with severe mental health issues?
those are the homeless people absolutely everyone is terrified of and make pariahs of
   some justifiably so


there's this long running joke [meant solely as a joke] my dad has had since i was little
 ""you're beyond help""

   the truth in that joke cuts deep.
