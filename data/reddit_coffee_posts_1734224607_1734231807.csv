1hejeqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1hejeqz/lpr_is_ruining_my_life_and_i_feel_so_stuck/,LPR is ruining my life and I feel so stuck,"It all happened so quickly, but two weeks ago I started feeling something in my throat, and soon that led me to this spiral of not being able to breathe properly. At first I thought it was related to stress/anxiety since I was going through some pretty big life events (moving, final assignments were due for uni). By the end of the week I had some fun events and it should have all been great and a stress-reliever, but my incapability to breathe got worse and it has singlehandedly ruined my life.

I've had two episodes now where I would be outside and suddenly the inside of my mouth is heavily dry, I'm experiencing air hunger, can't swallow or breathe, my hands and legs get all shaky, and I literally cannot breathe unless I have some water. It's awful. 

I went to my family physician a few days ago and he said I most likely have silent reflux, and prescribed me esomeprazole. The days leading up to the appointment, I actually was doing better and was able to go outside and do normal things. I was eating food and drinking coffee and felt fine, that out of breath sensation was mostly gone, only at night before I slept, but my sleep has been fine (its the only thing that has been consistent this entire time). But the second I started taking esomeprazole, it came back. Yesterday I was at the cinema and had to literally stand up multiple times because my hands and legs were shaking and numb (probably from lack of oxygen/poor blood circulation), and today I have not been able to eat all day. Mind you, I went to the cinema a week ago and I was fine (and I was experiencing bad breathing/throat tightness the day before). Today I took esomeprazole in the AM but it has just made me lose my appetite, worsened my symptoms, gave me headaches, etc so I've been sleeping/lying down all day. Tonight I was quite hungry though so I tried to slowly eat, but it came to a point where I felt my throat closing and almost choked and my heart was racing so I had to stop. 

My shoulders are quite tight (they already get tense easily on its own), I'm hungry but I can't eat and the internet is telling me to eat only certain things, and I just feel so lost and alone. I made another appointment with my physician because he told me to see him again if the medicine doesn't work, and he would look into getting an h.pylori test and/or endoscopy, but he warned me that the wait time could be long. 

I'm honestly scared that one of these days I'm going to d word in my sleep because of how bad I can't breathe and it's causing unnecessary stress onto me, when I have nothing else to stress about in my real life. I'm a healthy 21F who has had digestion/bloating issues in the past but I started taking enzymes and I still do and they helped me get rid of that issue. I'm wondering whether the trigger for this was actually a few days before the symptoms really started kicking in, I ate this extremely spicy sandwich with jalapeno and the entire skin on my lip and under my nose went numb in pain (it went away in like an hour but it was quite terrible). That has never happened to me before, but I'm wondering whether that messed something up. But right now my priority is to get back to a somewhat state of normal where I can eat without choking, or go days without eating. ",1,1734231600.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

1hejcre,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimLounge/comments/1hejcre/muslim_women_with_western_ideologies_are_nightmare/,Muslim women with Western ideologies are nightmare ,"I‚Äôm a man who grew up in very egalitarian western societies. I grew up, went schools and most of world understanding and views are in many ways shaped by my new country. However, I have a strong Islamic upbringing and background, fished madrasa (was hafiz at one point, working on it with Allah grace). So my values and characteristics are still shaped my beliefs in Islam. 

Lately, I have been in search for a companion and soulmate. It has been harder than I could ever imagine to say the least. I meet and talked with number of women. I must admit at first, I was looking someone who was academically inclined as me but the more I talked to women with university degrees and in profession, the harder and complex it became. The biggest issues thus far has been, women who are from Muslim households, dressed and appear Muslims but ideologically and opinions wise hold almost non Islamic views and aspirations. 

Some examples: 

1. Women who wants to get know one another, go for coffee dates, meet ups in town for walks and wants to keep it on for 1-2 years. Find it weird women in their 27+ are clueless about what they wants or not.

2. Weirdest yet, women who are career oriented and either wants on 1-2 children and or wants to delay having kids in order climb up in the career ladder. 

3. Headache one. Materialistic women who are all about to impress others. Wants big  Nikah, big weeding and honeymoon (it was a deal breaker for some of them). Absolute big no for me. Small is blessing. 

4. The strong and independent women, who wants to work and earned their money, still expect the man to pay for everything. The notion ‚Äúwhat is hers is hers, what is his is hers‚Äù. Total crap! 

The reason I wants to choose a Muslim women is because I am a Muslim and looking for Muslim household with clear intention built on Islamic foundation.

Mom and Artist and general maker of beautiful things by night. I‚Äôm cute, curvy and if I‚Äôm honest probably a bit cocky. My New Year‚Äôs resolution has been to draw a portrait everyday (because I‚Äôm truly awful at it.)



I‚Äôm missing that human connection in my life, so here I am. I work from home and I want to fill my dull moments with interesting conversation. I prefer discord - text, voice chat or voice calls. I love to laugh and have a sarcastic semi dark sense of humor. I am witty and analytical. I am creative and feel things deeply. I am eternally curious and restless. I am clever and determined. That all being said - I enjoy back and forth with a fellow quick-witted person with a sparkling personality, of course.



Some things I love:



I love firsts.



First conversations, raw and awkward. Filled with empty space that really aren‚Äôt empty at all.



I love the spaces in between words that are filled with silent anticipation all while studying so intently trying to catch a glimpse of what is inside.



I love first sips of coffee.



The first time you hear your new favorite song.



I love taking a step back and seeing the art that I created for the first time.



I love feeling the warmth of the sun on a really cold winter day.



I love finding new words that almost magically and beautifully describe senses - vellichor, petrichor, pareidolia and apricity (see above).



I love accomplishing something that I never thought that I could.



I love questions that expose a unique perspective that didn‚Äôt seem obvious.



I love clever puns and responses.



I love setting new goals and challenging myself to grow and learn constantly.



I love being afraid and then the feeling of relief felt after taking the leap.



I love scars. Deep, dark and twisted telling every story of what truly shaped who you are.



I love when watercolors seep together swirling into a beautiful new color and pattern.



I love discovering new and unique things - people, art, locations or even new experiences.



About you? I don‚Äôt want to limit who you are ‚Ä¶ I love meeting people from all walks of life.



Message me if you are:



30+



Appreciates humor.



Curious.



Intelligent - not limited to a formal education.



Creative would be a bonus but not required.

I'm not mentioning the brand but they are out of Boulder CO. Today she was drinking out of it and it started sparking, she threw it on the ground and it exploded with the force of a mortar shell firework and stared on fire. It literally knocked her off her feet. We were vending at a busy christmas market inside a tent, so I grabbed it and ran it outside and threw it in the snow and used a fire extinguisher to put it out, but the lithium battery kept re-igniting until it burned itself out. Thankfully she wasn't hurt physically due to her quick instincts, but emotionally terrified. She actually forgot it at home this morning and we went back home to get it, luckily, as this would have started a fire in our house for sure. 
She is of the opinion that we need to let the company know asap so they are aware of the problem, which I don't disagree with, but I also feel we are deserving of some compensation as well. I was a volunteer firefighter and due to my quick actions I probably saved the entire 120 foot long tent with a thousand people in it from catching fire at my own personal risk as well. We always followed the companies instruction for cleaning, and it was not wet at the time of the explosion except for coffee in it. How should i proceed with this?

1hej5q7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1hej5q7/what_am_i_doing_wrong/,What am I doing wrong? ,"I am a 37-year-old woman who has tried numerous dating apps, including paid versions, without any luck. When someone does happen to match with me or respond, they quickly friend-zone me. This has happened with three different people already.

Out of curiosity, I decided to filter exclusively for men instead of women, just to test the functionality of the app. My inbox was flooded with messages the very next day. Now, I am unsure what I am doing wrong in attracting women.

I am not sure why people insist on friend-zoning me before even giving me a chance.

The first woman I went out with invited me to see a movie and have a few drinks. Even before we met, she stated that she was only interested in friendship at the moment. A few days later, I learned she was dating someone else during the same period that we were spending time together.

The second woman, whom I met at my apartment complex, expressed a similar sentiment. She claimed she was in a poor emotional state and had no intention of dating anyone. A few days later, I discovered that she was active on the same dating app as I was on.

The third individual I encountered was much the same. She invited me for coffee, despite living about two hours away. When I attempted to get to know her through text  before meeting, she suddenly declared that she was merely looking for friendship. This came as a surprise, given that her profile clearly stated she was seeking a long-term relationship.

And these are just a few examples. I am not someone who will put myself out there like this, it took me a year to muster the courage to even post this on reddit, and it‚Äôs disheartening that, after all that effort, people show little to no interest. Their quick move to friendship instead of romance truly stings. I am not opposed to beginning as friends while we get to know each other, but it does not seem that any of them share this intention.

I have a stable, full-time job and am currently pursuing further education. While I wouldn‚Äôt call myself the most attractive woman in the world, but I am a decent person who treats others with respect and kindness. I don‚Äôt go out much nor do I drink often; I primarily focus on work, schoolwork, and my love of reading / audiobooks. 

I apologize if this seems like an excessive amount of venting, but after more than a year of these experiences, I don‚Äôt know what else to do. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated.

But, I can‚Äôt help but keep thinking about how he treated me in the first year of our relationship.. with little improvement in the following years. 

We accidentally got pregnant 5 months into our relationship, and I was really scared. We were both in our final year of medical/dental school. He immediately told me to get an abortion without further discussion, and me being scared, I thought that was the best way forward too. I decided to go interstate to my second home to get it done because I wanted to be away from family. On the day I was supposed to fly, I cleaned his place while he was at lectures, and we were supposed to have about 1.5hours to have a quick last lunch together before he took me to the airport. He decided to go do his weekly grocery run on his way home, and we ended up having only 40 minutes left to spend together. I got upset, and he said I don‚Äôt understand how busy he is (he later admitted he could have found other time). He gave me the silent treatment in the 4 days prior to my abortion. I went alone, paid for it alone, but we got back in contact on the day of the abortion and he stayed on the phone with me while I was miscarrying and screaming in pain (to this day it is the worst pain I‚Äôve ever imagined, 60mg of codeine and I was constantly on the verge of blacking out from pain). He then asked if it was cool that he went out with friends for dinner while I was still in pain. For our 6 month anniversary, we decided to do couples rings, to solidify our relationship and signify commitment, especially after what we went through. When I asked him what budget we should set, he said ‚Äú1k‚Äù. I said okay. I got him a solid gold band of about 1k value, to be fair to him, even though women‚Äôs rings are typically more expensive. When time came on our 6m anniversary, there were no flowers, no restaurant booking, no acknowledgement and no ring. He had bought a fake ring off a Chinese ‚Äútemu like‚Äù website, and it hadn‚Äôt arrived yet. I gave him his ring, but mid day, I broke down and asked him why he didn‚Äôt buy a ring to exchange on our 6 month anniversary, especially for what it symbolizes after what we went through. He said it isn‚Äôt his fault it hasn‚Äôt arrived yet. I told him even if it‚Äôs a cheap silver band from Michael hill I would be happy, at just something to exchange on our 6 month anniversary as we had previously discussed. I asked him why he chose such a dodgy website, but also why did he purchase a ring worth about $10 when he was the one that set a 1k budget. He said he couldn‚Äôt meet the 1k budget. I asked him why he set that so high then, knowing I wasn‚Äôt working at the time, I had to dip into my savings too to make that, but I thought it was quite an important step in our relationship so I did it. He said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what my ex would have wanted‚Äù. And I said ‚Äúif that‚Äôs what your ex deserved then what does it say about what I deserve if you go and get a ring like that‚Äù. We then moved past it (if I hadn‚Äôt gotten pregnant, I know I wouldn‚Äôt have stayed in that relationship and disrespect, but as a girl from a conservative family, I was so scared). 

For my birthday 2 months later, he got me a cheap jewellery box from the dollar mart. I don‚Äôt even wear that much jewellery, apart from a pair of everyday diamond earrings and a necklace, which I keep in their original Tiffany boxes. He had asked me if I wanted a jewellery box, I said no, he got me one anyway. That‚Äôs what sucked. He said he thought I said no to be polite. I told him that the close proximity of the abortion, ring situation and my birthday (the lack of effort, no dinner or cake) made me feel absolutely worthless. He said wait for Valentine‚Äôs Day, I‚Äôll make it up to you big time. 
Two weeks later, it was Valentine‚Äôs Day, and he said to stay home all day to wait for my flower delivery. I waited and waited, and at 6pm a small bunch of dead spray roses came. I was floored. They were actually wilted. I sent him a photo and said he should ask for a refund. He‚Äôs not very proactive so I called the florist myself to ask what this is about. The florist, who turned out to be a cemetery florist, said, no offence but you got the cheapest bunch from the cheapest florist in the state, on Valentine‚Äôs Day, what did you expect. He refunded me, but politely said I feel sorry for you. 
My partner then told his friends I was selfish and materialistic and that I expected too much for Valentine‚Äôs Day, although he was the one that told me to wait for Valentine‚Äôs Day because he was going to make it up to me big time. 
Then came along out 1 year anniversary, which he said he was going to make up for me. He took me to a nice hotel for the night, but I could see on his booking.com account, which he gave me, to book hotels for an upcoming overseas trip, that he had booked the penthouse suite for his ex girlfriend, rooftop bar access (exclusive) and breakfast in bed. My partner tried to haggle with front desk to ask for free rooftop bar access, and was asked to pay the access fee, he said nah not worth it. He initially hyped up watching the sunset from the rooftop bar, as one of the highest in the city with floor to ceiling glass, but when he couldn‚Äôt haggle his way in, he was like nah and ended up napping by himself through sunset. Also, on the lead up to our anniversary, he had asked me multiple times to send him a link to a designer bag I wanted. I‚Äôm in no way a materialistic person, I don‚Äôt have any designer bags, but he insisted, so I linked him to a lower end 1.2k bag. I had the expectation that I was receiving that bag, so I bought him a nice leather work bag, almost 1k. I also made him a handmade gift and a card. When we exchanged gifts, he gave me a cheap silver necklace worth about $30. I was disappointed because he had continuously said explicitly, multiple times he was getting me a bag. We went to dinner, which I planned, then when the bill came, he asked to split the bill. 
We walked the 20 minutes to the restaurant me in heels because he didn‚Äôt want to pay for the Uber to save money. On the way, he said I looked really sad. I tried to smile and not ruin our day and said I‚Äôm not. Even when receiving the necklace, I excitedly put it on and said thank you, even though it was not what I was expecting nor was it my style at all. 
He said we can watch the sun rise, because we didn‚Äôt get to see sunset. When I tried to wake him the following morning, he didn‚Äôt want to. I went to ask the hotel staff if I could go watch the sunrise on a veranda somewhere, and they said sorry that wasn‚Äôt available for low level rooms (which I had). I got myself a coffee and sat next to the small window in our bathroom and watched the sunrise by myself and cried hard. The next morning we went to a cafe for breakfast on the way home and split the bill again. 

I feel like if he had just taken me to a different hotel, or at least given me the same experience he gave her, I wouldn‚Äôt have minded. Given the comparison with the ring situation, and Valentine‚Äôs Day, my birthday, given he‚Äôs told me he‚Äôs given her expensive gifts like a Dyson etc, yet cheaps out on me, I felt absolutely worthless. 

When I raised my concerns a few days later, that I felt hurt by the 50-50 when he use to be so generous with others, and the hotel booking, when I could see he went all out with another partner (which he was aware I could see), he said ‚Äúfine, we‚Äôre never doing a hotel getaway ever again‚Äù and we still haven‚Äôt to this day.

For our second anniversary, he had promised he would get me a designer bag this time, and he got me to send him a google doc with a link with a few options. I got him a new phone and some other heartfelt things, but he said he was going to get the bag ‚Äúlater‚Äù closer to when we go overseas, so that we can get the tax refund. 
With 5 days before going overseas, I half teased him, while we were lying in bed, if I was still getting the bag. He said ‚Äúoh you still want it?‚Äù (By the way, leading up to this, I had given him a 30k loan to buy a house, stupid of me I know, and he kept saying if his stocks hit a certain amount he would get me the bag (it did), he said repeatedly again that he would get me the bag, again). 
I was heartbroken yet again but just told him I‚Äôm headed to the city and will pick up the bag he promised and used his card. 

I feel like I find myself reflecting on our relationship a lot, and I find it especially hurtful when I think about these incidences. I find it hard to not feel sad, even though it‚Äôs been a while. 

On the outside we are both highly successful people, and everyone says we are a power couple. I want to know, would you be able to forgive and move on from what has happened? I find myself thinking about how I was treated a lot. Things have slightly improved, but like he said, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not that type of person anymore where he would spend all his money on his partner‚Äù this isn‚Äôt what I was expecting but I just want to feel worth it and loved. 

Am I over reacting by thinking about the past? He now shouts me a meal for my birthday and for our second anniversary. Is this something you can move on from? Please be honest with me. ",1,1734230592.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Buggy and Stormcat make their way around Azur Lane after being dismissed from the testing site, a less than gentle nudge for them to go and be part of whatever activity they want to undertake, that is not technically work-related. And Stormcat has a certain place she has set herself to go visit for her own unconventional reasons.

////

It was an almost idyllic midday within the port, a blue sky, cool winds gently blowing, bringing the calming scent of the sea as well a refreshing sensation even with the midfall‚Äôs sun on one's back.

In the middle of such blissful weather, Buggy and Stormcat were walking at a calm pace through the port of Azur Lane. Both feeling like they had achieved a great deal of things, regardless of being technically on a forced vacation, imposed on them by the commander of Azur Lane. But alas, more than once they had a discussion or two about the subject, all Valkyries agreed that they felt somewhat restless if they were not moving or doing something.

Even now, during their small vacation, they found enjoyment in participating in whatever activity took place within Azur Lane. Fortunately for them, many of the Kansen also preferred to be active as well as creating some sort of event.

After lending a hand on the second day of tests performed with the Siren walker, brought by Doctor Bethencourt, they had been graciously kicked off the test site by some of the girls. Insisting that they shouldn‚Äôt spend their free time on the test grounds, since it was technically work-related, and encouraging them to find something else to do, preferably something that didn‚Äôt require a report at the end of the activity.

When it came to actually do something they wished to do for themselves, it was Stormcat that had something in mind that she wanted to do, or rather, something they could do only now that they were at the main base of Azur Lane.

¬†

‚ÄúYou really memorized the whole place already, uh?‚Äù Buggy asked, finally breaking the silence that had settled once they made their way out of the test site.

‚ÄúWell, we had plenty of opportunities, on the first day they gave us a brief tour.‚Äù Stormcat replied ‚ÄúPlus, this morning Coby convinced me to accompany her on a morning jog alongside Tennessee and some other girls keen on taking advantage of every second of daylight.‚Äù

‚Äúah‚Ä¶ how was that like?‚Äù Buggy asked somewhat gingerly about it.

While they preferred to be on the move or doing something, there was always individual characteristics and peculiarities to the Valkyries. And in Buggy‚Äôs case while she was quite reliable and serious, she tried her best to take to heart the idea of this being a break of sorts. As such, she certainly did not spend her first morning in Azur Lane waking up her teammates at dawn break in order to go for a jog around the island. Plus, from the sounds being made early morning on their accommodations, as well as the current conversation, someone else took it into their hands that her team had some morning exercises.

‚ÄúEh, it is a nice enough place. It‚Äôs the people that make it shine, really. Some of these girls are quite cheerful and accommodating.‚Äù Stormcat shrugged her shoulders at that statement.

‚ÄúThe arrangement of the base is kinda hectic. We made our way to pick up some more people from each dorm to join the jog around the base. It‚Äôs a pretty common thing for them, apparently. That‚Äôs why I know where to go now.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd where is that? You kind of just started walking without saying where you intended to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I didn‚Äôt tell you?‚Äù Stormcat giggled at that.

‚ÄúE-yup, sure haven‚Äôt‚Äù

‚ÄúI see, my bad, sorry.‚Äù

""You still haven‚Äôt answered my question"" Buggy insisted in a semi-playful tone.

""Fine, if you want to be so insistent about it."" Stormcat replied while raising her hands in a defeated gesture.

And regardless of such a statement, Stormcat simply remained quiet for the next few minutes. Buggy could only sigh internally, as well as quite openly about it. Her companion was wont to have bouts of whimsical behavior, and she knew by vast amounts of unfortunate experience that once Stormcat got into such a mood, it was simply better to not pursue any further, especially if one didn't feel like engaging in some kind of tomfoolery.

And they were technically in vacation time, as such she simply allowed the lull of the conversation to turn into a pleasant sort of quiet moment where she didn't have to get straight answers out of her team.

It was after several minutes of walking through the well paved roads of Azur Lane that they reached one of the various Kansen dorms. Buggy was surprised by the sight of it, she more or less expected something militaristic in nature, but in reality it had the profile of a common modern building. It certainly didn't look the part of a modern corporate building, but it still held a certain degree of that ominous feel from such a place.

Thinking about it she realized that she didn't know enough architecture to be able to formulate an opinion about the minute details of modern architecture. To her it was a building, it had its walls and it had its windows. She didn't feel like the building was making any sort of statement about anything in particular. Probably about being a neat and tidy place, if anything.

Stormcat entered without any sign of apprehension and Buggy just followed her inside, onto what was obviously a reception of sorts, a couple of couches with a coffee table in between, calm music could be heard coming from somewhere within the reception, with magazines and newspapers on the coffee table and even a reception desk past that, giving the impression that they had entered a lobby rather than a dorm.

""¬†*Guten Morgen*¬†. What can I do for you?"" A girl manning the desk said.

Buggy was somewhat startled by the voice as she didn't realize someone else was in that room with them. Now that she paid closer attention, the girl behind the desk looked both serious as well as somewhat reluctant to be at her current station. Or perhaps a bit too distant. So far Buggy had interacted with a whole bunch of extroverted Kansen, so this would be her first interaction with someone that was more on the quiet side.

The girl had short dark brown hair held on a few braids, 2 small ones framing her face, and most notably her tidy and somewhat complex uniform that drapped her in dark blues, red and golden accents, A beret on her head and most notably a puppet that seemed to be made out of metal on her right arm.

""Eh, we came to see whoever has the food."" Stormcat stated.

Buggy¬¥s mind came to a screeching halt upon hearing her companion's words. Many ideas and words came to mind as well as possible implications of what could be actually going on, all coalescing into one simple statement.

""For the love of- you just wanted to have Iron Blood food?!"" She asked in disbelief.

""Er... I mean, it is a bit more complex than that..."" Stormcat replied inching away from her superior.

""Oh! wait, you two are Valkyries visiting, aren't you?"" The girl manning the desk asked.

""I see... it makes sense. I hear you sometimes make a pilgrimage to the¬†*Vaterland*¬†, but I suppose it makes sense to want to come and visit¬†*Mutter*¬†if you happen to be here. And you should be hungry."" The girl said as she eyed the two of them.

Before hearing their responses, the girl checked a clipboard she had nearby, flipping the pages and nodding a few times to herself.

""Right now, both¬†*Mutter*¬†as well as¬†*Herr*¬†Bismarck are in a meeting with the commander, but they should probably arrive after lunch time"" She quickly stated going over any possible counter argument that Buggy could even come up with.

""You are free to remain here at the reception if you wish to. But If you are feeling peckish, Miss Th√ºringen should be practicing in the kitchen and she could be able to prepare something for you.""

""Yes, that would be ideal!"" Stormcat replied before Buggy could even say something.

""Understood, please follow me. My name is Georg Thiele, I¬¥ll guide you to our kitchen."" The girl said, nodding at them in acknowledgement.

""Ah, nice to meet you. I am Stormcat, er... just Stormcat, I suppose."" Stormcat said.

""Nice to meet you, I am Buggy of the Eagle Union¬¥s Valkyries"" Buggy managed to introduce herself, coming to a better known territory for her, quick and simple self introductions.

""Likewise"" The girl stated, she nodded marginally in response and turned around, making her way into the dorm building without waiting for a response.

Buggy wanted to explain that while she was in fact hungry, her main reason to visit the Iron Blood dorms within Azur Lane was not something as unseemly as wanting to taste their local food. She had no real counter argument at that, and while she frantically went over which arguments she could probably bring regarding such a thing, she continued following Stormcat and the IronBlood destroyer.

Her opportunity to explain herself became slimmer when she realized that they had already entered the kitchen within the dorms. She became immediately fixated on how big and tidy the place was, everything seemed like it had been cleaned purposefully with the intent to host visitors, or probably an inspection. Which was pretty much on point with what she had experienced of the people from Iron Blood.

Then again, an inspection was probably taking place already, as she noticed there were three more people in the place. One of them was dressed like a maid of sorts. Truth be told, Buggy had not had much exposure to the whole maid culture until she came to Azur Lane, where the exposure to such a thing had been above and beyond what she had thought possible.

Some of the royal Maids had made her wish she could make some, less than professional requests from then, on a more private setting. So all in all she found some trouble trying to concentrate whenever there was a group of maids working. And this time wasn't an exception as the low cuts, present around everywhere on their attires, had distracted her enough that yet another conversation had already started before she could fully realize it.

""Guttern morgen, Miss Gneisenau, Miss Scharnhost, Miss Th√ºringen, these girls are Valkyries visiting us, they have come to visit¬†*Mutter*, and they also want some food.""

Without giving much else of an explanation, the Iron Blood girl simply nodded and made her way out of the kitchen while everyone else remained a little bit confused by the statements.

Once George had left the kitchen everyone looked at each other as if trying to make sense of what had happened, as if the others had more information about what was taking place.

And one of them decided then that was how things must actually be like.

""You are Valkyries then, correct?"" A tall Iron Blood woman asked them.

Buggy was once again surprised by how different each Kansen seemed to be, as well as how bold they could be regarding their attires.

In front of her stood an Iron Blood Kansen with striking blue eyes framed by professional-looking red-rimmed-glasses, long straight lilac-colored hair, wearing a cap, part of her uniform of dark blue color with red accents, if it could be called an uniform, really. She wore rather small shorts, and thigh highs, a jacked that seemed like a pointless piece of wardrobe as it both exposed her midriff as well as her shoulders, and her sizeable chest was barely contained held by a white shirt that was once again fully exposed by the jacket.

""Buggy, you are staring too much again"" Stormcat chided softly at her companion, bringing her out of her daze.

""Ma'am! I am sorry, I didn't mean to stare but if only respectfully!"" Buggy quickly babbled as she stood at attention.

""It is all fine."" the other girl sitting beside that particular Kansen answered. ""While most would readily assume it is improper, we won't easily shy away from someone willing to appreciate fine Iron Blood engineering.""

""You are completely fine-eh-Right!! You are completely right ma'am!."" Buggy quickly replied, composing herself mid sentence as best as she could.

The second Kansen was apparently related to the first, with the same build, same hair color, and similar uniform just slightly different on some parts, covering more of her body and yet somehow displaying much more at the same time. but most notable on her was an eyepatch covering her left eye.

""I think we might be teasing her too much as it is,"" The third Iron Blood Kansen in the room said, one with calm blue eyes and long gray hair, being for some reason dressed like a maid.

""Yes. Please, let's just disregard my friend while she overcomes her sudden bout of shyness."" Stormcat said with a grin to her face.

""Wait no! dont disregard me-!.. a-bah ba- I mean!"" Buggy tried to complain about the implication of her getting shy around the Kansen, but she only managed to fumble her own words in a majestic fashion ending up covering her face for a couple of seconds trying to hide her blushing face while she put one finger up, indicating for everyone else to give her a few moments to compose herself.

""While that is comical enough, it would probably be for the best to make note it would be on her best interest that she doesn't meet Eugen, or she will risk most of her vocab being teased out of her"" One of the two sisters said, the one with glasses, stating it in a matter-of-fact way, to which the other Iron Blood Kansen simply agreed by nodding in acknowledgement.

""Anyway, I am Scharnhorst, this is my sister Gneisenau and this is Th√ºringen."" The Iron Blood girl with the eyepatch introduced each one as she signaled at them with her hand, with each one nodding minutely in response.

It was obvious she was done with their introductions as they looked intently at Stormcat and Buggy.

Stormcat had enough experience dealing with Iron Blood people to be able to pick on such a cue, she looked at Buggy who had recovered enough to seem at least ready to introduce herself properly if left to her own devices, and probably if left alone with people with less distracting attires.

""This is Buggy, and I am Stormcat, both of the Eagle Union Valkyries."" She introduced both of them in a simple manner, signaling each one of them.

""Oh? At first I thought you were a Tiger, but that doesn't seem to be the case at all."" Gneisenau said as she fixed her glasses and looked at Stormcat with a much more appreciative look.¬≠ ""So tell me, what brings you to the Iron Blood dorms? You don't seem to be Zealous enough about your origin to be looking for Miss Freiderich, nor¬†*Herr*¬†Bismarck.""

""Well yeah, that would be interesting in itself, I suppose, with our origins and all that."" Stormcat said as much while shrugging in a noncommittal fashion.

""I am here for the food."" Stormcat stated, again.

""What do you even mean with that?!"" Buggy exclaimed, once again bothered by such a statement coming from her friend.

""You have heard before how important it is for the Tigers back home to come and meet Miss Friederich and Miss Bismarck! This is kind of disrespectful!"" Even though Buggy wanted to shout at her friend due to how wrong all this situation seemed to her, she managed to keep her voice low, and she even managed to somehow whisper the last part of her statement.

""I mean, we are proud of food, so we can probably just indulge your request, even if it's a little odd."" Th√ºringen, the maidly dressed Iron Blood Kansen said as she eyed Stormcat.¬≠

""Oh really?! Thank you! Now I'll really know if Emma and Emilia are pulling my tail about their food being actually great or if they are just pranking me with their bad rations.""

She said as much, as she looked at her friend with a pleased look on her face, nonetheless she failed to notice that everyone else in the room had a look of confusion on their faces.

""Wait, what do you mean by their bad rations? Iron Blood rations? Is that why you are here?"" Buggy all but hissed back at her friend.

""Eh? I mean, yeah, a couple of our companions back home are two Tigers, sent there as part of the Valkyrie exchange system and what not"" Stormcat said matter-of-factly, as she more or less gave her answer as a simple explanation to everyone in the room.

""Wait, two Tigers have shared their rations with you? Iron Blood Valkyrie Tigers?!"" Scharnhorst asked with a look of disbelief on her face.

""I mean, yeah? There are two Tiger Valkyries on base, I often get teamed with them because they seem to respond positively to me, I think?. Tough girls, just seem like their responses to most things are too intense at times."" Stormcat said as she shrugged her shoulders.

""Like, at the end of missions they would make a point of making a campfire and heat up some of their rations. They would constantly brag about how the real dish,¬†*'from the vatherland'*¬†would be so much better while giving us canned stuff that I could barely palate."" She said as she pantomimed the gestures made by the Tiger Valkyries in question.

Stormcat continued explaining, completely blind to how the Kansen from the Iron Blood, as well as her own companion, were looking at her with astonishment evident on their faces.

""Er... I don't think I have ever been offered any of their rations"" Buggy said while looking at Stormcat who seemed agitated over the whole canned food situation.

""Actually I don't think I have heard of anyone else being offered some of their stuff"" Buggy commented softly as she pondered on the issue.

¬†

Everyone remained quiet as the statements seemed to confuse everyone in the room, even Stormcat who wasn't aware that no one else had tried the Iron Blood rations.

""You must be a hell of a fighter then!"" Scharnhorst loudly stated as she crossed her arms, breaking the silence that had fallen onto the room, looking at Stormcat with a whole different look on her face, evidently reevaluating her opinion of the Valkyrie in front of her.

""Eh?!"" Stormcat said intelligently, looking like a cat startled by the IronBlood girl raising her voice. Her two tufts of hair, which resembled cat ears, also flopped backwards in response to her surprise.

""They must really appreciate you."" Her sister Gneisenau added, accommodating her glasses as she looked intently at Stormcat and Buggy, stopping if only to look at Th√ºringen and nodding at her, part of some interaction that went completely over the Valkyries heads.

""Ok then, I suppose this would be a great opportunity to put my skills to the test. But with things as they are, I am thinking we should also call for Nurnberg."" Th√ºringen said in response to Gneisenau's meaningful look at her.

""That seems like the right thing to do. No offense meant to you, Th√ºringen. You are quite accomplished at this, but Nurnberg really has a way to bring the flavour of the fatherland onto any dish."" Geneisenau said.

""None taken, I know what you mean. I don't intend to presume I can bring the best to the table, and I am quite happy knowing my skills are developing. I wish I was able to bring some of the 'old flavours' I remember to everyone, but until I reach a decent enough level, I am happy to continue practicing.""

""Now if you will excuse me, ill go for her then."" Th√ºringen said, making a minute curtsy while holding her attire, leaving without much fanfare.

""Now, come sit, I will serve you some good beer. Iron Blood cuisine is meant to be served warm and with a cold drink on hand."" Scharnhorst said as she stood up and started looking at the cabinets within the kitchen.

""heh, they have said as much before."" Stormcat said as she took a seat that had been offered by Gneisenau, with Buggy following suit next to her

""Hah! They must really like you."" Scharnhorst said with a rather jovial tone to her as she continued going over the kitchen, now holding two tall glasses intended for their drinks.¬†

""You should probably remain at the dorm until Miss Friederich comes back, she will surely want to hear from your interactions with Emma and Emilia. Really, she is always delighted when she hears something from her 'Valkyrie daughters' """,1,1734230575.0,AzureLane,0,1.0,False

1hej2bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1hej2bq/frequent_urination/,Frequent Urination,"Hello. I am currently being tested for POTS as i have many of the symptoms according to my DR and own research.

Tonight, I have been having frequent urination, every 45 minutes, and it's a lot. (Didn't measure) It's clear and I have not had many fluids today. Maybe 20oz of water and 10oz of coffee at most. I am bad at drinking fluids. Regardless, I am urinating a lot and very often + clear.

It does not burn or hurt. Some days I will drink a ton of water and not pee for 8 hours. Then there's days like this where I am not really hydrated yet I am going very often.

I am really worried about this and want to know if it's POTS related. I saw one post that seemed to confirm but I was confused by some of the comments. 

Also diagnosed Hashimoto's, if that's anything. ",1,1734230385.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

I (F25) always thought this guy (M30) liked me because he would tease me (lightly and playfully) every day. Even our coworkers tease us because, like me, I know they also feel like we like each other since we banter every day.

Last Friday, we went to the bank with other coworkers to take care of some important matters. Of course, they insisted I should sit in the front seat next to the driver, who was him. The traffic was heavy, and he jokingly commented about how lucky we were that he drove us to the bank. Deep down, I felt super shy because he‚Äôs a rich man, owns the car, paid for the gas, and didn‚Äôt even need to be there but still drove us because our coworker persuaded him to.

At the bank, I asked him if I could buy him coffee (I just wanted to thank him). He said yes, but only because we were with the group. However, when we got back to the office, he looked annoyed (though I‚Äôm not sure if he really was) when I asked him again about the coffee and said, ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt like it.‚Äù

This is just one of the few instances. 
I‚Äôm so confused.

When I pull a shot of a single or even a double, I can't get what I'd expect?

The shot come out faster than I'd expect. For sure less than 20 sec. 

if you are successful using the barista express, can you please share your recipe. 

The beans I'm using are Lavaza, Dark Espresso Roast, blue bag.

I played with the grinder setup Started at 5 as it came in, and then moved to 4 and 3. 

I measured what the Barista will grind, it will be \~7 grams of powder for a single. 

The shot will come out star to finished in about 10 sec. Never got it to 20 seconds.

When I used the double shot, and put in quality ground coffee, i was able to get it out in close to 20 secs and the puck was pretty dry and formed. 

So my question, for a single shot and double shot, how much power should i get out and how long will the espresso shot come out in.

I always thought he was cute but I was never really interested because I thought he was into one of our mutual friends (they had 3 classes together so they saw each other a lot). We knew that we were from each others hometowns but that‚Äôs about all I knew about him. On the last day of class he asked for my instagram then I ran into him about a week later and he asked for my phone number. He texted me a bit about our final paper then randomly asked if I wanted to go to coffee before I went back home for break. We went to coffee yesterday and it was pretty short because he had job interviews before and after  (he graduates Monday and is moving back home). He offered to pay and drive me home, I declined to both in case he was intending for it to be a date. He wants to see me again when he gets back to our hometown and he says that it‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt have many friends back at home and wants to become better friends. 

I genuinely can‚Äôt tell if he is interested. The reasons I think he might be: asking for my instagram, number, & going to coffee. Reasons I think he might not: he‚Äôs graduating so we‚Äôll be living an hour apart, he said that he wanted to hang out so that we could be friends. 

Lots of mixed signals. I‚Äôve thought he was cute for the past 2 semesters (we didn‚Äôt talk or sit together in the class we had together last semester) but I never actually considered him because I figured there was no chance for nothing to be there. Now that we‚Äôre talking more, I definitely think there could be something there. I‚Äôll be graduating in the spring and moving back home too. I just don‚Äôt want to be too forward if he‚Äôs genuinely just looking for a friendship. 

Also, the guys I‚Äôve been interested in have always been unattainable or just shitty so, it‚Äôs nice to think there is potential with someone who is really sweet and initiating our hang outs/convos and not just me doing that. ",1,1734228539.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

Our 14 (almost 15) year old daughter started ‚Äúvolunteering‚Äù at a local coffee shop 6 hours a week. She does everything the employees do, except for free, not even tips. At the beginning of the year she was insistent that she wanted to do track in the spring. She also joined choir/madrigals and got a part in a play. Her grades started slipping and the play director was too chaotic (constantly changing everyone‚Äôs parts, lines, songs, etc) and sometimes rehearsal would go until 8:30pm. And this school is an hour round-trip. So we told her it wasn‚Äôt going to work out. So she found a part-time job instead.

She says doing track won‚Äôt pay her whereas the coffee shop will‚Ä¶eventually. I tried explaining that if she does it and sticks with it, she could get a scholarship worth multiples of what she would ever make in 2 years of working part time minimum wage. And we can‚Äôt afford to send her ourselves. She wants to study criminal justice and be a cop or detective. Which track fitness would also help with, as well as just healthy habits instead of laying in her room with the lights off learning how to be a ‚Äúpick me‚Äù from YouTubers. And she could really use some healthy competition.

‚Ä¶
I thought the wedding would be like any other events in the game.
They would decorate the town and not let me in before 9am. Then I would make my rounds and listen to everyone‚Äôs talk, loosely related to weddings. Then I would tell Lewis to get it over with, get married and finally find myself back home at 10pm, with my husband, waiting for me.

Instead it happened basically at dawn before I even got a chance to change my outfit and I was back home at 6am to start my day with a husband awkwardly standing there.

Now he is just there, sometimes giving me coffee, getting up much earlier than I expect of the man I married, just to water the six crops that aren‚Äôt in reach of the sprinkler and work on his motorcycle.

Also he seems to except my gifts every day now, which I hate‚Ä¶ the rules seem to have gone, he has no Icons for talks and gifts in the friendliest anymore.

I usually split the void eggs between him and Krobus, usually the game tells me that I‚Äôve given Seb enough, then I go to Krobus. Now the game doesn‚Äôt do this anymore and I have to actively plan to give Krobus gifts‚Ä¶

Also Seb doesn‚Äôt seem to hang out with Sam anymore, not playing band at Sam‚Äôs home, also not playing pool at the Saloon.
I feel horrible, but I didn‚Äôt ask for any of this.
Can he just go back to his routines? I married him because I liked the person he was, not the shadow of himself he seems to be now he‚Äôs living at my farm‚Ä¶

I've got a vague memories of it that I remember, and can recall some scenes out of, but have no idea what its called. Anyone think they recognise it?

1) The manga protagonist keeps flipping between the present, and what appears to be an alien place  but actually transpires to be the future. He ends up making subtle changes, and seeing the shifts a few times. 

2) At some point he is hunted by a guy with an energy gun, whos 'power' is to charge the gun, with up to two shots. 

3) he knows several kids who all have unique powers, and are orphans who are raised by an old lady. The apocalyptic future he trys to avert include these kids all being killed by a big bad when they try and stop it.
One of the kids is really short with spikey hair.

4) I think the main guy develops telekinesis.or maybe anti matter. There is a training scene when he trys to stir coffee with this mind, but is unable. Then after he walks away, it is revealed he drilled a hole in the table under the cup.

","(I have worked at our workplace for almost two years, while he just started working there about a year ago.)

I typically like to remain unlabeled on my sexuality because I am so young (hence the \*). However, all of my loved ones have understood that I am a lesbian since I have never had any form of attraction to men and have never seen myself marrying a man; I have known this for most of my life. 

I am extremely grateful to be surrounded by such loving people who are learning to accept who I am. While having a crush on a man is a good thing in many ways (simpler social life living in the southeast US, to say the least), I feel extremely apprehensive about sharing this with my family. I fear that if I share the idea that I am attracted to one man, all of my ""lesbian tendencies"" would be seen as just a phase. Also, opening up the door to the possibility that I could get into a relationship with a man would leave my family disappointed with the hope of what could have been (me being in an open, ""normal"" relationship). 

Regardless of my feelings about my sexuality and my family, I still do not know how to navigate my relationship with the coworker, we'll call Luke, whom I have a crush on. 

I work at a small coffee shop with very few employees, so everyone is fairly close. A few of my coworkers that I'm closer with go out on occasion, Luke included. While the other coworkers consider me a friend and vice versa, I'm not sure how Luke sees me. He is fairly strict with separating his work and home life and has never outright called me a ""friend"" out loud. He has never said otherwise, but I like to keep this thought process to keep myself from being overly delusional. 

Anyway, I guess I'm asking for advice on how to build a stronger relationship with him. I know that romantic relationships are not a priority to him, so I have essentially ruled that out for myself. Even if he didn't feel that way, it would still be difficult to open the door of a romantic relationship because all of my coworkers are under the understanding that I am a lesbian as well. Regardless, I still would like to be closer to him. He is genuinely one of, if not the smartest, wittiest, and well-spoken people I've ever met. All I want to do is surround myself with his company, but this feeling is so overwhelming that I've forgotten/realized I've never known how to socialize with someone I want to be in my life. 

If anyone has any advice on how to pull myself together and be able to socialize with Luke without overthinking everything, it would be greatly appreciated.",1,1734227314.0,Advice,8,0.56,False

I might sound crazy here, but I could really use some reassurance. 

I've switched to decaf coffee and tea for several years now. I've only had the occasional caffeinated drink a few times over the past few years as an ""emergency"" when I felt tired and had to drive somewhere (usually late at night).

I had my third transfer earlier this month and my first beta came back at 71 (yay!). I have my second beta on Monday. 

I decided to treat myself today to a large decaf cappuccino while reading at a coffee shop. After I returned home, I started to notice the effects of caffeine (energetic, a little jittery, etc) and started to panic. Did I make a huge mistake ordering this drink? I haven't had any significant amount of caffeine in over a month, so maybe my body isn't used to it? I do track my heart rate via a smart watch, and my heart rate has been normal. 

I could really use some reassurance right now. It may sound paranoid, but I am worried this may negatively impact any potential pregnancy. My first transfer ended in a chemical and my second didn't implant at all.",2,1734226897.0,IVF,6,1.0,False

","For the past 2 years, I've been dating (34YO male) a single mum (35YO with 2 children).

I'm deeply in love with her. She is beautiful and I have a natural chemistry and connection which I've never had in a girl before. For example, I can't swim. She helps me on holiday be able to to swim despite how embarrassing it must be.

I'm a doctor, earn quite well (100k+), like to work out etc. I couldn't drive at the start of our relationship so she used to make a big effort of driving 1 hour every week to see me and back. Sometimes I would get a taxi to see her (it'd cost ¬£60+ per way but it was rare).

She does have kids so telling my parents etc would be a huge step. My friends have told me to steer clear due to the children but I felt a very strong bond with her.

Anyway, she is lovely. Due to her eastern European culture and beliefs, I paid for everything. Every meal, every drink, every taxi. On holidays we did discuss but I essentially ended up paying for 99% of things. When taking kids out, I'd also cover 95% of the expenses except for one day-event we did.

I had some financial hard times (as I am self employed, shifts went quiet) but I still took her on holiday during this time because she wanted it.

anyway, recently things have been tough. she has advised me I don't take responsibility and only look after my own life. I have recently bought a car after finally passing my driving test. I was hoping this would make life easier for us but I am getting to grips with driving the car so not quite confident doing long journeys (only been 1 week of owning it).

Last weekend,. she woke up and said she wanted a holiday so South American destination. This would cost me ¬£6k for 2 people, and then I need to take time off work which costs me ¬£2k. I advised I need to be careful with he bank balance for now. This caused a huge argument. She told me all I have done is 'put food on the plate' (when I referenced I pay for all restaurants, normally ¬£100-¬£200 bills) and for the holiday, she advised if I can't take her to her destination, where can I afford. She also explained she mentioned to me her radiator in her bedroom doesn't work properly for 2 months and I haven't fixed it.

There have been incidents for example her child had a bed delivered. she mentioned its to me but never asked me to help fix it. she would then get angry and ask me. I would off ourselves go over (costing me ¬£120 to come and help fix up a bed) but I didn't mind because I love her.

I am really good with kids (as I the nature of my job) so I have made full efforts with the kids when I am with them to get to know them. it did hurt me as she feels I am 'like a friend or buddy' to them rather than a responsible adult.

anyway this argument has culminated in us reaching breaking point. she feels I do not take responsibility, I do not make her life easier and I am not taking responsibilities in her life. she is concerned if she was to get pregnant or couldn't work, I would with hold things from her she'd want (like her nails, hair or holiday) because of finances and that she needs these things to be happy.

I tried to re-assure but I also did convey my own feelings. I want someone to build with and things like holiday I think we can contribute together and plan. For example, I know she may earn half what I do so maybe contributing as much as she can without causing stress and I pay for everything else. Even a 75/25 or 80/20 split.

I mentioned this to my female colleagues in work and they were horrified and looked at me with very emotional eyes as if I was too kind and soft. I was never like this in my life to be honest. Always a bit of a player but this is probably the first time I have been deeply in love with someone.

We have shared so many beautiful moments together and I do adore her. I am sure the blame rests with both of us but she seems unable to see my perspective and meet in the middle.

I am worried as I am getting older. Over the relationship I have physically let myself go (used to have a six pack). My friends are all married. I have no one to turn to or talk to or go out with to bars or socialise. I feel my life is very empty and she gives so much meaning to my life.

On the phone with her today, I did essentially cry. I've never cried in my adult life. I am very very very strong normally but this is probably the only person in the world who can make me feel strong emotions. I just couldn't at the end of the conversation hold in my emotions. She didn't seem to cry. I feel what she wants maybe I can't provide at this moment in time but I've tried my best even through tough times. She did advise meeting in person to discuss and see if we break up. However on the phone I did suggest we may need to call it a day as I can't give her what she needs despite me trying.

she did explain to me she feels I don't make her life easier. I should be offering to pick up her kids, fix things in her house, take her on trips and holidays and buy her presents. for me this is hard when I am already covering 100% of all expenses in our relationship. also I didn't have a car until recently, now I do, more is possible.

some changes I tried to make to make her feel more welcome in my house is always buying foods she wants. smoked salmon, crab/lobster, fish, steak etc. TBH some of these foods are quite pricey IMO to eat everyday. she also asked for a coffeee machine. I never drink coffee hate it. bought one for ¬£80. however 1 year  later she said its a cheap/rubbish one so I bought ¬£400 luixury one she sent a link to me for. I also had a dark black room for my cinema.. she didn't like it. I painted it white/cream (Good decision tbh). 

Any advice on what I do next? How I should be feeling? at the moment it feels lonely, and to be honest outside of my close family (who I don't wish to tell much of this to). I have no where or anyone to turn to. I don't want to discuss this too much with people in work. I only told them as they told me I look pale, and different as I'm normally full of life. any suggestions how I widen my social circle?

It just shook me to my core and I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk about it with. I‚Äôm 29 years old, male, and I just moved to the Northern California area about a month ago. I had a promising job lined up; being poor and without family or friends holding me to my hometown, it was an easy decision to follow the money. Being from a small town in South Dakota, the rent prices here blew me away. I don‚Äôt know how you all do it. 


Anyhow, all the following events take place over 2 weeks. 


I spent the first couple days after arriving in the city of Sacramento sleeping in my car with my pet rat (His name is Chester). I spent most of my days wondering whether I was in the Farm to Fork Capital or the City of Trees and searching for housing. Most options for affordable rooms were hiding behind an anxiety producing amount of paperwork, or it was some creep looking for: ‚Äúsomeone who would warm up to the idea‚Äù of being ‚Äúcuddling roommates‚Äù. I shuddered at the idea of needing to accept that kind of um‚Ä¶ ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. 


On the third night, my luck seemed like it was turning around. A home! Well, a room in a home, but it had heating (which is more than I could say for my clunker of a Subaru) and the rent was only $400 a month flat. I knew there was going to be a catch, I just wish I had known what that trade off would leave me with. I would have never gone to look at the room. 


The Ad read as follows: ROOM FOR RENT:


800 sq ft room, $400/mo, (no utility payments will go to you) and one shared bathroom. 


You‚Äôll have access to a full kitchen, parking in the rear alley and lots of going ons in the surrounding area (bars, music venues, etc.). 


No drugs, drinking, guests or pets. ~


No pictures included. 


The required sobriety and no guests told me that whoever was renting the room was an oddball of some sort, but sleeping in my car another night with some weed shake was still worse. I emailed the poster hoping that Chester wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. He‚Äôs tiny and never leaves my side. After a nerve wracking hour or so, I got an email back:


‚ÄúHey, thanks for your interest. I really don‚Äôt like animals, but no one else has reached out. Why don‚Äôt you come by this evening and we can chat. 


[ADDRESS REDACTED]


Emailed from my iPhone
Bobby Grant‚Äù


I took a couple minutes to do some celebratory fist pumps in my car and held Chester‚Äôs hands and had him do a little happy dance. It was fun until I realized someone outside the car was staring at me with a concerned look of curiosity. I quickly stashed my little friend, waved at the stranger and drove off towards my potential new home. 


Pulling up in my car, I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful the house was. It was an old Victorian house, with a fun paint job and a lovely front porch staring out at the busy street. I was already imagining spending mornings out there petting Chester and sipping coffee. I walked up and was going to knock on the door, but as I went to, Bobby opened it. 


Bobby stood much taller than me and he looked down on me with very empty eyes. He was probably at least 6‚Äô4‚Äù with a barrel chest and cannons for arms. His stern face was covered in a thick beard, that only made him look less welcoming. 


The one thing that threw me for a loop was his hair. Wavy locks of auburn hair fell just below his chest. I was kind of stunned honestly, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever even seen a woman with hair so glamorous. 


I noticed I had been staring at him and he looked like his patience was running thin. 


‚ÄúOH‚Äù I yelped, caught off guard ‚Äúsorry you scared me a little bit!‚Äù


‚ÄúWeird, okay‚Äù Bobby flatly replied. 


This first impression was starting off just great. 


‚ÄúHey, this house is gorgeous you‚Äôre a lucky guy being able to live here‚Äù I tried to get off on a better foot and not screw up my only chance for a warm night indoors. 


‚ÄúLuck huh?‚Äù Bobby snorted ‚ÄúMy grandpa bought this home 30 years ago when it was in shambles. I helped him restore it as a young man and when he died he left it to me. I earned this home.‚Äù


‚ÄúOh-yea-‚Ä¶I just meant uh‚Äù I hated this. Being stuck in a one-on-one with someone who seemed to ignore all the unwritten rules of pleasant conversation. It didn‚Äôt help how much he towered over me too. I just wanted to seem submissive and agreeable, it‚Äôs what he seemed to want and I had no room to argue. ‚ÄúI just meant that it‚Äôs a really amazing home, you and your grandpa must have been as close as you both are talente-‚Äú


‚ÄúJust stop.‚Äù Bobby cut me off ‚ÄúYou seem fine, I‚Äôve been told I come off cold. It‚Äôs just me. Relax okay?‚Äù


I internally sighed, grateful. He might still be an asshole, but at least I know it‚Äôs not personal I guess. I thanked him for saying as much and he invited me in. 


We sat down in the living room, he poured us some tea and we talked for an hour or so. I spared him hearing details about my personal life, I figured he wasn‚Äôt the kind for small talk. He asked about where I had come from, what I was doing for work and what my plans for the future were, just basic screening of a stranger. I understood too as I sat in front of him wearing the same clothes I was wearing two days ago and holding a rat. He initially seemed kind of disgusted when he saw Chester, but as I spoke to him, I would give Chester pets and a cashew or two. I don‚Äôt think Bobby loves my little guy like I do, but he seemed more curious than grossed out and that seemed like the best case scenario. 


After I gave my life‚Äôs summary, Bobby shared a few details of his life with me. He grew up in the area with his grandparents. Apparently, his mother had left when he was born and his father was either unable or didn‚Äôt care enough to raise him alone. I decided it was best to not dig into that. 


Bobby‚Äôs grandfather was a fairly successful businessman, apparently owning a large marble quarry in Italy, and moved with his young family to California. Whatever had happened with Bobby‚Äôs dad, it had apparently pushed him out of the will, so Bobby got everything. Now he spent his days working out, reading books and building unique carpentry projects. A simple man. I can respect that. 


Then I saw a little bit of life glow in his eyes and he sheepishly said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve actually put a lot of effort into my hair lately.‚Äù 


I was so caught off guard. It was like a switch had flipped, he was such a different man than who I spent the last hour talking to. It was even more extreme than that, it was like if you flipped the switch and instead of a light coming on the entire room swapped with another. 


I definitely wasn‚Äôt going to miss an opportunity to gas him up though. ‚ÄúOh man I can tell, it looks really good. What kind of stuff do you use?‚Äù He started giving me his routine and I nodded happily not knowing a thing he was talking about. 


My acting seemed to pay off, cause at the end of our conversation Bobby asked when I would like to move in. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt cleaned the room yet bu-‚Äú I stopped him, ‚ÄúNo, no! That‚Äôs fine I can clean! Is it okay if I moved in now?‚Äù Bobby seemed a little surprised but said that was fine. 

A week passed and things were great actually. I thought that I would be hiding in my room any time I was home, but Bobby and I would chat with each other more and more each day. It still wasn‚Äôt a lot and nothing too much more than surface level conversation. I was happy to have someone to talk to anyways. 



One day, as I was getting home from work, a strange man opened our door from the inside as I was reaching for the handle. ‚ÄúSorry, excuse me‚Äù he said curtly as he brushed by me. I walked inside and looked into our living room, Bobby was there sitting on the couch holding a large black pump bottle. ‚ÄúTraveling salesman must have had a good pitch huh?‚Äù, I chuckled, ‚ÄúBobby?‚Äù He hadn‚Äôt looked up from the bottle. ‚ÄúBobby? Hello?‚Äù He snapped out of his trance, ‚ÄúWhat? Oh hey.‚Äù He looked back down at the bottle. ‚ÄúWhat have you got there?‚Äù I asked, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new conditioner, product isn‚Äôt even on the market, I connected with this guy online.‚Äù 


I laughed a little internally, I don‚Äôt think I would ever get used to seeing this guy be so obsessive over his hair. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so special about it?‚Äù I plucked the bottle from his hand and gave it a quick look over. It didn‚Äôt have any brand name that I recognized, but I mostly used Head and Shoulders 2-in-1, so there‚Äôs probably a lot of brands I‚Äôm unaware of. The only thing I had time to read was ‚ÄúAd Infinitum‚Äù before Bobby aggressively snatched it back. He held it close to his chest and had a look in his eyes that was a mix of anger and worry. I think he realized how it came off, ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù he said ‚ÄúIt was pretty expensive and I‚Äôm just excited to finally have it.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow expensive are we talking? 40-50 doll-‚Äú ‚ÄúIt was $175‚Äù Wow, it was a big bottle but even still that seemed like a lot of money for hair products. I guess Bobby did have a significantly more amount of money than me. )}


One day, I got home from work. I opened the door and Bobby‚Äôs head quickly popped out from his room, ‚ÄúHey! Was there a package for me?‚Äù He asked anxiously, ‚ÄúUh yeah there was‚Äù I held up the football sized brown box that was on our porch. ‚ÄúYES‚Äù I‚Äôd never heard him shout before, I jumped a little. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs got you so excited?‚Äù I asked as I quickly tossed him the box. He had started running towards me and I thought he wasn‚Äôt going to be able to stop if he got too close to me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new conditioner I read about.‚Äù

I chuckled in my head, no matter how much I got acquainted with Bobby, seeing him get excited about his hair was so amusing. ‚ÄúWell it must be pretty special to get to you like this.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt $150 a bottle it better be special!‚Äù Wow $150 for hair product? I couldn‚Äôt imagine spending that kind of money on anything so frivolous, but to be fair I couldn‚Äôt imagine having the kind of money Bobby had. 


My job was going well I joined an apprenticeship, pay wasn‚Äôt great at the start, but I just had to stick with it and I‚Äôd start making more. I‚Äôd leave for work around 6:30 in the morning. As I got up on Monday morning I heard water running in the bathroom. ‚ÄúBobby must be trying out that new product‚Äù I thought. 

When I returned home around 4, I heard water still running. ‚ÄúIs Bobby taking another shower?‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt the most hygienic person but two showers in a day seemed excessive for someone who wasn‚Äôt doing too much day to day. Maybe he worked out and was just cleaning off to enjoy the rest of the evening feeling fresh. 

A couple hours passed by, Bobby was still in the shower. I put my ear up to the door and I thought I heard something. It was quiet, but I could‚Äôve sworn I heard Bobby‚Ä¶singing? I didn‚Äôt want to be pushy or anything but  I really needed to use the bathroom. I knocked on the door, ‚ÄúHey, uh, Bobby? Are you gonna be out soon? I gotta use the bathroom man.‚Äù Bobby replied very flatly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not finished‚Äù I started feeling desperate, the only thing that could be worse than me being a pest is if I shit my pants in this guys house. ‚ÄúBobby please I need to-‚Äú I started to jiggle the doorknob. ‚ÄúIM NOT FINISHED‚Äù Bobby yelled at me. 

That scared me. It almost scared the- well you get the point. I opted to head to a coffee shop around the corner and use the bathroom there. When I came home, Bobby was still in the shower. I could see steam starting to pour out of the bottom of the door. I began to wonder if this wasn‚Äôt a second shower, would he have spent all day in there? I put my ear up to the door again, and this time clearly, but quietly I heard Bobby in a sing-songy voice ‚ÄúRinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. 


Maybe he had OCD and opted to not tell me. Even still to spend over 12 hours in a shower seems wild. I ate dinner, went to my room and fell asleep to the white noise of the water running. This was really weird and I was starting to wonder if I made the wrong decision in living here. I almost decided to grab my stuff and head out, but I think it would look bad to head to work with my whole life in my car. 


I went to work the next day, Bobby still  was in the shower. He was singing louder too, not too much but I could hear him without going right up to the door. I didn‚Äôt know how I was going to handle this. The rent was so low and at my starting pay, I couldn‚Äôt afford to live anywhere else, but if this man is completely unhinged I didn‚Äôt know if I was safe there. I tried to focus on my work and not think about whether or not Bobby was still showering. 


When I got home, I froze going to unlock the front door. I had to be losing my mind, but it was so crisp, Bobby was screaming now. ‚ÄúRINSE AND REPEAT. RINSE AND REPEAT. RINSE AND REPEAT.‚Äù As I stood at the front door, our neighbor walked up. ‚ÄúHey man what the fuck is going on in there?‚Äù My heart was beating through my chest. ‚ÄúI-I-I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really worried.‚Äù The neighbor looked annoyed ‚ÄúI told him if he lost it again I was calling the fucking cops.‚Äù Looking back now, I wish I hadn‚Äôt tried to calm him down, . ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that. Let me try and see what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù 


I opened the door and started walking towards the bathroom.  Bobby‚Äôs screaming rang through the house. There was a feeling in the air too, something screaming just as loud as Bobby telling me to turn and run. I pounded on the bathroom door and nervously yelled ‚ÄúBobby? H-hey what‚Äôs going on man, you‚Äôre scaring me! BOBBY!‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was ignoring me or couldn‚Äôt hear me shouting over his own singing. 


I decided that I had to do something. While I don‚Äôt know what he had done previously to upset the neighbors, clearly Bobby was not in a good spot mentally. I took a couple steps back and lunged forward shoulder first into the bathroom door. 


As soon as I was in the bathroom, I was hit with a wall of steam. Something smelled really weird, kind of metallic and it became strong and thick mixing with the steam. ‚ÄúRINSE-AND-REPEAT-RINSE-AND-REPEAT-RINSE-AND-REPEAT‚Äù Bobby was screaming louder and in faster succession. I went around the small wall that separated the toilet and the shower and I was horrified. ‚ÄúBo-Bobby?‚Äù I looked at the glass wall of the shower and it was covered in blood. ‚ÄúRINSE-AND-REPEAT-RINSE-AND-REPEAT-RINSE-AND-REPEAT.‚Äù ‚ÄúBOBBY COME ON MAN WHATS GOING ON?‚Äù My hand was slowly reaching toward the door handle. In my head I was telling myself ‚ÄúStop. Don‚Äôt open it. Leave.‚Äù But it was like my hand was in auto-pilot. 


When I opened the door, a mixture of water and blood flooded onto the floor. I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes. Bobby was smiling. A twisted smile. Something like if an alien wearing human skin was trying to smile but didn‚Äôt get the subtleties and ended up looking a creep. Above Bobby‚Äôs sick grin he was scrubbing conditioner into his hair. Except, it wasn‚Äôt his hair anymore. He had scratched so hard he had torn the skin on the top of his hair. Flaps of skin draped off the sides of his skull. Flesh and hair had clogged the drain. His fingernails were mostly gone, removed from continuous and furious scratching at his exposed skull. 


I vomited, adding to the noxious mixture of blood, chunks of flesh and water that was pooled on the floor. Bobby looked at me, blood was flowing down his face and into his eyes that were so wide open I could‚Äôve believed he had cut his eyelids off. 


I screamed a primal scream. Something animalistic, a reptilian brain reaction to the horror I was witnessing. Our neighbor appeared in the bathroom, having heard all the commotion. ‚ÄúJESUS CHRIST WHAT THE HELL‚Äù Bobby inhaled deeply and let out one more strong ‚ÄúRINSE AND REPEAT‚Äù then collapsed in the mess on the floor. 


We called 9-1-1, but Bobby was dead by the time they got there. Loss of blood they said. I didn‚Äôt know what had happened, I told everything I did know to the first responders and then they loaded up Bobby and left. I got Chester, some necessary items and left. I could come back for the rest, but I couldn‚Äôt be there anymore. Because Bobby was dead there wasn‚Äôt much of a way to figure out what had happened. It seemed like he had just snapped and my being there was only bad timing and even worse luck. 


Like I said, I‚Äôm not sure exactly why I wanted to share this, but I needed to tell someone. I couldn‚Äôt carry it in my head any more. So if you got to the end here, thanks for sharing in my trauma and sorry too I guess. Also if anyone in the Sacramento area has a place for me to live I‚Äôd appreciate it. I‚Äôm finishing this story at a local gym, I got a membership to be able to use the showers. There was a little bit of the Ad Infinitum leftover, it didn‚Äôt seem right to let such expensive stuff go to waste and  Bobby wasn‚Äôt going to be using it anymore. Let‚Äôs see how pretty my hair can be. ",2,1734225935.0,creepcast,0,0.75,False

Tips for Maintaining Your Bright Smile After Teeth Whitening Treatments
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After going through teeth whitening treatments, it's essential to maintain that bright smile you've worked hard to achieve. A dazzling smile not only enhances your appearance but also boosts your confidence. Here are several effective tips to help you keep your teeth white and bright for as long as possible.

### Practice Good Oral Hygiene

One of the best ways to maintain your bright smile is to stick to a solid oral hygiene routine. Brush your teeth at least twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste. Don‚Äôt forget to floss daily; it removes plaque and food particles that can yellower your teeth over time. Consider using a whitening toothpaste to help maintain your brightness.

### Watch What You Eat and Drink

Your diet plays a significant role in the color of your teeth. Foods and drinks such as:

- Coffee
- Tea
- Red wine
- Berries
- Tomato sauce

Can stain your teeth. If you consume these items, rinse your mouth with water afterward. Using a straw for beverages can also help minimize contact with your teeth.

### Limit Staining Agents

In addition to being mindful of what you eat or drink, consider limiting how often you consume staining agents. Instead of drinking multiple cups of coffee throughout the day, try to cut back to one or two. This will reduce the opportunity for staining and help your smile stay bright.

### Stay Hydrated

Drinking plenty of water not only benefits your entire body but also helps in rinsing away food particles and reducing acidity in your mouth. Water can naturally help keep your smile looking fresh and can combat dryness that could promote staining.

### Regular Dental Visits

Make sure to schedule regular dental checkups and cleanings. Your dentist can help keep your teeth clean and free from plaque. They can also assess the condition of your whitening treatments and suggest touch-ups if needed. Professional cleanings can enhance your whiteness and ensure the health of your gums and teeth.

### Consider Touch-Up Treatments

Depending on the method of whitening you‚Äôve used, you may want to consider touch-up treatments every few months to maintain that newly brightened look. This could involve at-home whitening kits, whitening strips, or dental professional treatments. Always consult with your dentist to find the right option that fits your needs.

If you decide to use over-the-counter whitening products, use them cautiously. Follow the instructions closely and avoid overuse, which can lead to tooth sensitivity. If you experience any irritation or discomfort, discontinue use immediately and consult your dentist.

### Avoid Tobacco Products

Tobacco can significantly stain your teeth and compromise your oral health. If you smoke or use other forms of tobacco, consider quitting to keep your smile bright and reduce the risk of gum disease and decay.

1hehpiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1hehpiy/would_you_attend_a_church_for_non_believers/,"Would you attend a ""church"" for non believers? Sounds kinda dope NGL(If I wasn't such an introvert)","Hello everyone! So, would you attend a ""church"" that has nothing to do with faith? Just a building where people gather on Sundays, or whatever the fuck, to have some social interaction?

  
I know that things like this exist, or rather I am convinced they exist. Though, I have never been to one. have you? If you have been to one what was it like?

  
In my mind it is super gay for starters. Just gay all over the place. Live music played by local bands. Maybe a lecture at each one. Like a lecture on the evolution of eyes. Or a lecture on why Tolkien is the best author ever and if you disagree you are wrong. Or a lecture on how to grow the best damn strawberries in your garden. Is there anything that a church can do that a group of non believers could not do? The only real hook of the church I can see is the emotions. It would be hard for a group of people who do not believe in a higher power to conjure the same emotions and feel the same things. But... why would we fucking need to? Group therapy would allow you to feel your emotions in a safe place, but also be far more beneficial than praying about it. Or rather something akin to it at least. Just a group of people who have a lot of the same stuff going on all talking about it and trying to give one another advice and comfort. 

  
Let's do it. We start with bagels and coffee and shit. Just catching up for people who come early before things get started. Then we go into live music by local bands. Pretty good music, not the best you have ever heard. But it's live so that's nice. Next we split into groups, based on a number of things, for something akin group therapy. Next is a lecture on abiogenesis and what we know so far. After that is some time to talk with everyone again, just mingle and catch up with people before you go home.

  
You got to go out, see other humans, cry in a safe space, listen to live music, learn something, and socialize on your Sunday with none of the guilt and shame attached to it. No one trying to teach you that you are inherently bad or any of that. ",10,1734225770.0,exchristian,8,0.92,False

They are just really rude, selfish, self-righteous, and the most unaware and uncaring people I've ever met. His parents are also racist and his mother is genuinely the worst, most evil woman I've ever met. 

We've been dating for almost 3 years now and he only just told his parents about me about a year ago because his parents, especially his mom was very racist towards my culture and hateful of me. She hated my culture, the fact that he was spending time with me lots, etc. He finally told them and I went over to their home once, and his dad was fine but his mom was the worst. The entire time she wouldn't talk to me and kept talking to my boyfriend only in another language even though she knows English. She also made some comments about my culture which came off racist and just mocking of my culture / putting it down. I took flowers and baked a cake specially for meeting them for the first time and I'm a good baker and it was a really good cake liked by others, but his parents didn't even try it until my boyfriend cut it. Once he did, the dad did complement it, but his mom said nothing. After my boyfriend asked her how it was, saying how it was so nice and it looked so good, was when she finally said something, however she said it was just ""ok"". Then at the end as we were leaving, she gave the whole cake back to us which I gave to them as a gift even though they knew we weren't going to be home for another 6 hours so it would've gone bad. Then, towards the end, as we were leaving and running late to something, his mother hugged him and just started crying saying how she misses him so much and that they've don't see each other enough (we live like 2 hrs away from them and he sees them once every month or 2 but not much because of university). I found this really weird cuz who just cries like that in front of someone new for this, especially when they live like not even 2 hrs away from him. 

Even afterwards, she continued making remarks about me and trying to get my bf to break up with me and saying that he can score someone prettier, taller (I'm 5'4 so not even that short), and someone whose mother hasn't died of cancer - yeah she somehow made that a bad thing too. Instead of sympathizing with the girl who lost her mother at 17 due to cancer, she instead made it a bad thing, saying to him how she shouldn't be with me and shouldn't marry me because my mom passed away from cancer and that in the future I'll die and leave him and our kids alone, making him sad (we're 21 rn so we're not even at the age of being married). The cancer my mom had wasn't even genetic, and I get tested often still and have been tested negative for the gene too, not that it matters. Everytime he goes back home, she says something about me and tries to get him to break up with me or just tries to guilt him. She says that I'm the reason she doesn't see her son often, being totally unaware that he literally even left the city to go to another university to avoid her because she was so toxic to him growing up. 

Despite all this, I've still given his parents many chances and even invited them to my home, but his mom is still the same in the way she talks about me to my boyfriend. His sister and brother in law are accepting of me (both in their mid 30s), but they're just so weird and as if they never learned how to behave as decent human beings. One time my boyfriend was hospitalized so they came to visit him and I offered them my apartment to stay the weekend over, but they were so rude and just overall had guests making a mess and causing me an inconvenience. They also brough food and snacks just for my boyfriend and absolutely nothing for me when they got to the hospital even though I had been there all day next to him and they knew. They even brought their kitten to my home, leaving me with no choice in the matter, and because of that I couldn't leave my own dog at home while visiting my bf at the hospital, and having to pay for doggy daycare. Me and his sister and BIL had also made plans to go eat dinner at this one restaurant after leaving the hospital, otw to my home, but as I drove their in my car, I ask them where they are and they messaged me saying they had already bought food and eaten but if I want them to join me still at the restaurant we were all supposed to go to, then they can. Like wtf???? I was so hurt by this and didn't want their pity so I just went home and went to bed without having eaten. While I got ready for bed, they sat their and ate their takeout food at my dining table, without asking or offering me any, despite having known I hadn't had lunch nor dinner as I was at the hospital all day with my bf. And to make things worse, they knew I'm a vegetarian and I don't bring meat into my home because it goes against my values, and they still bought and ate meat in my home, without even asking me. Next day when we all went to the hospital and were leaving at night, we (the 3 of us) made plans to go eat dinner together and even though I didn't want to and was still very hurt, I gave them a second chance. At the restaurant, the waiter asked us if it'd be one bill and they both say no and then I pay separately for my less than $20 meal. They are 15 years older than me and both work full time jobs while I'm a student, who literally gave them a place to sleep in for 2 nights and saved them so much money that they would've spent on a hotel because my boyfriend's place isn't big enough and he has roommates, yet they still didn't pay for a single meal for me nor buy me food. Next day they went and ate food outside but I had no desire to go with them so I stayed home and then we all met at the hospital. They then brought lunch just for my boyfriend, and nothing for me, while I stayed home and literally cleaned their mess they left in my home. 

I hated them so much after this weekend, especially because I let them into my home only after the 2 times we'd met, and they disrespected me in my home. Despite all this, I still gave them more chances because I wanted to be okay with them for my boyfriend's sake. But time after time they hurt me and just make me wanna never talk to them. 

My boyfriend got hospitalized again and I've been with him for days taking care of him and even let his family know so they could come see him, but they've been the most unappreciative, rude, selfish, unaware, and uncaring people I've ever met. I got myself a hotel and was going to come in today around noon and told my bf and his sister, but a while later, when his parents came to the hospital, the 4 of them went to go eat lunch without having asked me at all to join them. I came to the hospital as they were eating lunch and just sat with my bf in his room while I had my coffee and pastry I had just bought. There are only 2 visitors allowed in his room so when his parents came in, me and his sister and BIL left the room and went to the waiting area. Then his dad came out to go buy snacks and protein shakes for my bf, and he left with the sister and BIL without telling me anything, not until I called and asked as they were walking away what they were doing. Then, the 3 of them come back and walk right past me while I was there studying for my exam, and didn't even care to say hi or tell me they were all going into my boyfriend's room. Only 2 visitors are allowed and I thought we were sticking to that because that's why I had originally left, but then the 4 of them went into his room and they were all there for like 40 mins, while I was just sitting there alone outside when they hadn't even thought to tell me that they came back from buying snacks for my bf (they didn't bring anything back for me FYI). I felt so alone and sad because I've been the one with my bf for the last week and even drove him 2 hours away to a better hospital, all while they weren't here. I did all that and forget being unappreciative, but they literally just left me outside. I just sat there and cried in the waiting room. What kind of people do that? They are all 15-40 years older than me yet they treat me like this. I tried messaging my boyfriend asking if they were all in the room but his phone was away and he didn't see my messages. I then eventually texted his sister and she told me after like 40 mins, that they were in the room. Yet no one still came and invited me in, even though I've been the one here with him for a week, skipping my exams, driving him here, all while I'm also stressed and worried for my exams. 

I hate them all with a burning passion and never want anything to do with them for the rest of my life. I'm done with them. I love my boyfriend so much and gave them so many chances, but they haven't changed. I am now done with them and just don't want anything to do with them nor see them again after how they've treated me time after time. AITA for feeling this way? AITA for telling my bf I never want to see them and that I'm fine with him having a relationship with them, but I don't want any part of it nor see them again and that he can see them as much as he wants, just not with me there? Is it wrong to ask him to choose between me or his family?

I'm getting my name changed at the end of february so I've been messing around trying to figure out one I really like. It's between Viktor and Silas at the moment. 
I really like what Viktor means to me, it reminds me of literature and writing, coffee, late nichts, ambition and work. It feels like a name I might grow into as I get older, it feels mature and like an image to aspire to? 
I also quite like Silas, 1: because of what it means (forest, woods), I love nature a lot (plants and animals and just watching things) and being named something close to that would feel really nice I think. 2: because it's somehow softer? Viktor sometimes feels quite harsh and I don't know if that really fits me with my too short stature, quiet voice and generally anxious and soft demeanour.

My middle name is going to be Sam because it's what I've gone by for the last 5 years (and it reminds me of lord of the rings-) and I don't actually mind it much as a nickname, it just feels too childish to be my first name for the rest of my life.

So to start I just need to vent about my current dating life and experiences as I have no one else in my life to really talk about the way I feel without getting blown off or being told ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry you‚Äôre young‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay to be single‚Äù

So I‚Äôm a 21 year old dude, just turned 21 a few months ago and currently my dating life is dead. I‚Äôve had two long term relationships that lasted 2 years and then my last one was a year and a half and both of them were shitty and they were a bit abusive at times towards me. I was dumped back in August by my ex and since then I‚Äôve had no luck and it‚Äôs always seemed this way. I constantly get ghosted or like recently I went on 5 dates with girl, though it was great, though I finally found someone into me then I wake up with a ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a good guy but I‚Äôve never been filling it, hope you understand‚Äù text. Personally I didn‚Äôt really care as it just seems like my luck but currently o have no options and just a dry ass dating life.

I‚Äôm not trying to be full of myself or hype myself up but I think I‚Äôm attractive and I constantly get compliments from family, friends, coworkers or just random people but yet I struggle to find someone. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3 220lbs (I go to the gym every day and have gone from really scrawny to muscular) and pretty much think i should have no problem. I never seem to get compliments from people my age though that are girls,even in relationships I never got compliments and  most compliments come from people 25 and up. I get told all the time how ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a good looking dude‚Äù or ‚Äúi bet it‚Äôs hard to keep the girls off of you‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have no problem getting people‚Äù and yet here I am with the driest dating life. I‚Äôve never had a girl approach me, flirt with me (to my knowledge), ask for my number, or show general interest. Although I‚Äôm guilty of this too as I‚Äôve never approached anyone and if I did I wouldn‚Äôt know what to say.

So one of my main issues is that I really don‚Äôt go to a lot of places where I can meet people. I live in a very rural county in the south where most big towns are 40 minutes to an hour away and they don‚Äôt have much to do. I‚Äôm not interested in chicks in bars or clubs and I‚Äôm not interested in hookups. I pretty much go to work, the gym (which has girls but no one talks to each other) and college (which has the same issue as the gym, no one interacts). I have plenty of hobbies such as hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, traveling, farming/homesteading (I do things like make honey, roast coffee, make syrup, eggs and so on) but none of these gets me out to meeting people except maybe selling at a farmers market stuff I make. I go to church but there are no people my age besides my buddies and their girlfriends and everyone else is in high school or are 30 and married. I‚Äôve never had luck on dating apps so that out of the picture. So honestly I‚Äôm not sure what to do about meeting people.

So overall I have no luck dating. I seem to get stuck with people who don‚Äôt care about me or I get ghosted. It honestly sucks because my buddies have girlfriends who truly love and care about them, I can tell because they do little things for them and they always seem so happy. I seem to never have any luck and I wonder what‚Äôs wrong with me. Why do I struggle so much when others have it easy. Honestly I feel like something is wrong with me and I should just give up as I seem to have no luck. All I want is a girl that loves me and that I can love her and we can build a life together but that seems to much to ask for. Anyways just had to get this off of my chest, sorry if it‚Äôs a long read I just have been building this up for a while. ",2,1734225179.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1hehegi,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCAAFBseries/comments/1hehegi/wrote_some_code_that_predicts_a_recruits_ovr/,"Wrote some code that predicts a recruits ovr based on his Position, national rank, position rank and star rating","Was watching a youtube video earlier today about someone trying to predict the ovr of a recruits and remembered I am studying machine learning and that's probably something I could do as well.

So I gathered some recruit data and trained a deep learning model, right now cause of the limited data its not the most accurate thing in the world  
Gets an accurate prediction (Exact ovr give or take 1) about 56% of the time

semi accurate (Exact ovr give or take 2) about 61% of the time

and is within 3 ovr points 83% of the time.

  
Reason for this is probably limited data, deep learning models are typically used when you have data points in the millions but I didnt have time to train it on a whole recruiting class (If you want to try it ill leave the format I used in here lol) so the model is only trained on about 80 recruits. Let me show you how it works.

Only 3-5 stars are valid in this experiment btw.

  
Say Gabe Dingle is a 3 star running back ranked 635 nationally and 55 for his position, we would simply enter that data into the model (already trained on my environment but if you want to do this you'd have to fiddle with it a bit).

The model predicts a rating of 68 for Gabe, now lets go see what it really is.

This is counted as a semi accurate prediction cause its within 2 of the actual rating obviously.

Other Predictions: 

J. MCGINNIS : QB, 4 Stars, 18th Ranked QB, 203 National. Predicted Rating = 70, actual rating 76 (Innacurate)

T. FOUCHA: WR, 4 Stars, 10th ranked wr, 78 National, Predicted Rating = 69, actual rating 69 (Perfect) 

B CHILDRESS: CB 3 Stars, 73 ranked cb, 876 National, Predicted rating = 67, actual rating 68 (Accurate)

D SOLIDAY: LT 4 Stars 4th ranked LT, 98 National, Predicted Rating = 76, actual rating = 75 (Accurate)



Now I don't know how helpful this is cause literally all its telling you is high rankings and stars means better player but I think it would be helpful to use if you're starting off without many points and dont have hours to scout, being able to quickly pick between 2 prospects would be a good thing I guess.

Something interesting is however, at first I trained the model using height and weight as well, it wasn't as accurate, again this is something I would be interested in trying out again if I have time to populate the testing data again.

Speaking of testing data, it was in the following form

||
||
|Position|Height|Weight|National Rank|Position Rank|Star Rating|Name|Comitted to:|Rating|
|C|6'1|307|1647|53|3|K Bouye|Boise State|68|
|C|6'3|314|1313|43|3|T Otis|Syracuse|66|
|C|6'2|291|92|2|4|W Gardocki|Texas|73|
|C|6'3|284|986|34|3|F Scroogins|UCLA|66 |

With Name and Comitted to only being used to retrieve the ratings after they had been fully recruited.

Now this is usually the bit where I give you the link to a website that runs this program, problem is its written in R and I have no idea how to do that, I can leave a link to the excel file and the r code as a .txt file and someone who is more familiar with the language that me can help is all out, and if anyone in the community feels like sitting down and logging a whole recruiting class in this format (maybe even including dev traits if you're feeling like it) and we can try and make the model better and more accurate, because with deep learning models, realistically we should be aiming for accuracy above 75%.",2,1734224775.0,NCAAFBseries,1,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt smoke or do drugs, but I do enjoy a strong cup of coffee, the occasional drink, and staying active. Whether I‚Äôm scuba diving, cooking up a new recipe, working on a DIY project (yes, I renovated my entire house solo), or boating, I‚Äôm always keeping busy with things I love.

I‚Äôm hoping to meet someone kind, down-to-earth, and emotionally steady, ideally in her 20s or early 30s, who‚Äôs ready to build a loving family and share an incredible future. If that sounds like you, I‚Äôd love to hear your story and see where this could take us!
