Today is Easter Sunday. It‚Äôs a holiday I don‚Äôt normally give much weight to but today feels hard. I lost my brother last month and today, I would normally send him a one lined text saying ‚Äòhappy Easter‚Äô but now I can‚Äôt. This is a poem I started when I lost my grandma last year and finally finished today. Just want somewhere to share it so it‚Äôs not stuck in my head or my notes app.

***

Everything stayed just the way you left it -for a few days, at least.Then I poured your last cup of coffeedown the drain of the kitchen sink.Tidied up some papers,tossed away old receipts,organized your clothes,tried to keep them neat.Shuffled through some photos,changed the worn bed sheets,pulled down boxes from the garage,parked your car out on the street.Cancelled your subscriptions,made attempts at getting sleep.I see you now when I close my eyes;there's no point in counting sheep.
Some people came to carry awaythe little pieces of you.They moved around the furnitureuntil I didn‚Äôt recognize the view.I kept your old walletand some photos in their frames.I kept your favorite jewelryand cards signed with your name.
I‚Äôm learning that grief is just love with no home.I talk to you in prayer,instead of picking up the phone.I spend my days writing lettersI know you‚Äôll never read,and reading the last of your notes,like you wrote them just for me.
I‚Äôll cherish every moment,all the good and even the bad.I‚Äôll be forever gratefulfor all the love we had.

These sweet loves are all David Austin climbers (a special gift to myself after a tragedy back in 2017, grew from bare roots). (I mention that bc it‚Äôs not actually in my budget to spend much- I‚Äôm a big DIY-er). 

Anyway I have traditionally done the hand removal thing, and as soon as I finish typing this I‚Äôll head out there, tissues in hand, and start smashing the little buggers. ü§¢

I do the organic/ natural approach. In past years I‚Äôve tried adding more lady bugs, done the neem oil, planted garlic around them, and eventually just decided to let nature be nature. I‚Äôll help when I can and where I can. (Which usually amounts to the morning coffee wander, tissues in hand). I also try the hose em down thing, but honestly I never saw much of a difference with that. I do it anyway, bc I figure the ladybugs need it and so do the roses, but it never seems to affect the aphids. 

So- anyone else have any other tricks or special care I didn‚Äôt mention? Especially since they are getting taller? Tess over there on the grey building, it‚Äôs amazing how big she gets, it was a bit crazy trying to prune the top‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how people treat climbers naturally‚Ä¶

Today was supposed to be all about the exam. Months of preparation, sleepless nights, coffee-fueled cramming  all leading up to this one day. I walked into the exam hall determined, focused, and ready to give it my all.

And then, she walked in.

One of the invigilators  a woman with the kind of presence that quietly pulls you in. Graceful, poised, with a calm expression that somehow made the chaos around us feel still. I don‚Äôt know what it was exactly maybe the way she carried herself, or the way her eyes scanned the room with quiet intensity but in that moment, my brain forgot every equation I ever knew.

For a while, I wasn‚Äôt thinking about ranks or cutoffs. I was just trying not to look too distracted, even though my heart definitely was. I wondered what her story was. Did she notice me? Probably not. But for a couple of hours, she became the most beautiful mystery in that exam hall.

I finished the paper, somehow. Maybe it went well, maybe not. But part of me walked out thinking less about my marks and more about a stranger who reminded me that sometimes, life surprises you in the most unexpected, quietly romantic ways.

1k3n36h,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtongrowth/comments/1k3n36h/sometimes_total_chaos_and_what_looks_like/,Sometimes total chaos and what looks like disaster could actually be opportunity,"I wrote that in a journal entry in 2020 when we were forced to close our doors of our salon, coffee shop and cafe.  

It was the scariest experience in our businesses trying to lead through uncertainty. Not knowing if our businesses were going to survive through the shutdown and if when did reopen, we would still have teams to support the businesses.  We poured our blood, sweat, and tears into these businesses. The thought of closing our salon- after seven painstaking years of building it from the ground up, was heartbreaking! Fear was front and center, and it became easy to spiral downward into self pity. 

The thing that became apparent, the only control in uncertainty is your mindset. Your perspective and ability to see the silver lining through the chaos of uncertainty is what keeps you grounded. As much as we can plan for the future, none of us really know where our lives are headed. 

It‚Äôs important to have a plan, but just as important to stay open to the unknown possibilities and unexpected opportunities that come your way. We found ways to innovate, adapt, and keep our business afloat- and somehow, we didn‚Äôt just survive the pandemic, we grew through it. I even rebuilt my salon team all over again, shortly after reopening our doors.

The pandemic was a reminder that you are not really in control of your life, the only control you have is your ability to navigate the storms that life throws at you with flexibility and grace. 

The pandemic was that life quake that shook us and opened the door of opportunity to see that there was something else for us in store, something we hadn't planned for and didn't know was possible. 

Two years later, we made the bold decision to sell our businesses and start a new chapter in Spain. When we allow ourselves to grow through life‚Äôs storms, we level up- we become more courageous and ready to face new challenges. Gratitude, even in the midst of hardship, is a superpower. It fuels resilience, deepens courage, and helps us evolve into the version of ourselves we never imagined was possible.

1k3myca,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1k3myca/obedient_heart_chapter_one/,Obedient Heart - Chapter One,"David practically dashed through the door, eyes darting to the clock. He still had two hours‚Äîplenty of time to make everything perfect. He had to get it right. He hung his coat up, put down his work bag and hurried to the kitchen while glancing at his watch. It was 4.20pm, fortunately his boss had allowed him to leave a little early today so he would have plenty of time to make everything perfect for his wife. His wife. His Dream Girl. The love of his life. Emily. His heart fluttered slightly as he pictured her face, as he thought of her smile, of her touch.

Two years since they were married and he was more in love with her than ever. And tonight for their anniversary, he wanted things to be just right. He knew she would love it. He had gone to so much effort and he just knew she would be pleased with him. His heart fluttered as he imagined her walking into a spotless kitchen, her eyes lighting up‚Äîjust for him. He could imagine her look of happiness and love as she saw the bunch of flowers on the kitchen table, a beautifully cooked meal (Herb crusted Monkfish with Potato Dauphinoise and spinach ‚Äì her favourite meal)‚Ä¶and then the petals leading up the bedroom‚Ä¶His heart fluttered again. Her touch. Her smell. Her liquid eyes gazing into his‚Ä¶Concentrate! Concentrate! He thought. He only had two hours until she was home.

He prepared everything with a speed and precision that he was proud of. Emily had high standards and ever since the wedding he had made sure to adhere to them.

The front door clicked open to announce Emily‚Äôs arrival. Showtime!

‚ÄúHey sweetie, I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre home.‚Äù David walked towards her with a large, warm smile on his face. He took her coat and bag from her. ‚ÄúCan I get you anything?‚Äù

Emily swept past him, her luscious black hair flowing behind her, the scent of jasmine clinging to the air. She didn‚Äôt look at him. David was used to this. Sometimes she could be moody, sometimes she could be wrapped up in her own world. That was her prerogative. Even though it hurt sometimes, he knew better than to draw attention to it. Emily plopped herself down on the couch and put her feet up on the coffee table. David winced a little as he saw the mud from her boots appear on the table, the table he had polished only thirty minutes earlier.

‚ÄúLove you sweetie‚Äù He spoke, trying to get her attention, ‚ÄúDid you have a good day?‚Äù Still nothing, Emily was engrossed with her phone. David started to walk back to the kitchen when Emily stopped him,

‚ÄúGlass of white wine!‚Äù She asked, well‚Ä¶ it felt to David more like a demand, but he pretended that she was asking.

‚ÄúOf course sweetie!‚Äù He returned with the wine and placed it on a coaster next to her left hand. As he leaned over her, he inhaled her soft, floral scent and could feel his mind swim a little. It had been three months since they had last had sex. Three weeks since she had last kissed him‚Ä¶He longed for her.

‚ÄúTake my boots off‚Äù She said coldly. ‚ÄúOh and get this mud off the table before it dries!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes of course‚Äù He smiled serenely. He was adamant that nothing was going to ruin this evening. He loved Emily, he would accept being spoken to by her, however she liked.

He kneeled before her and lifted each leg up in turn as he gently removed each shoe. Emily ignored him as he did this. Not even a glance in his direction.

Once her boots were off and the table was spotless again, he sat down on the couch next to her.

‚ÄúI bought you a present Emily‚Äù He spoke softly, carefully. He was desperate for her to look at him, to acknowledge him. But he did not want to irritate her.

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù She finally looked up from her phone, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs sweet of you.‚Äù She smiled.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go and get it.‚Äù His heart was thumping as he retrieved the gift from under the bed and handed it to her, along with the card. Inside was something more than just a note. A poem. He‚Äôd written it late at night, over several evenings, pouring in all the words he was too afraid to say aloud:

¬†

*That night we skated, hand in glove,*  
*Your fingers wrapped in mine‚Äî*  
*Not for warmth,*  
*But something gentler,*  
*A promise I still hold.*

*The air was sharp, the stars were shy,*  
*You laughed as I stumbled,*  
*And I laughed too‚Äî*  
*Because you looked at me,*  
*Like I was someone worth falling for.*

*Since then, I‚Äôve fallen gladly,*  
*Every day, deeper still.*  
*Not just for the memory of your touch‚Äî*  
*But for the way you once waited*  
*For me to catch up.*

*If this night means anything,*  
*Let it be this:*  
*Even in the coldest winters,*  
*I have never felt alone*  
*Since you reached for my hand.*

¬†

‚ÄúAny reason for this?‚Äù She asked quizzically.

‚ÄúErrrrr‚Ä¶Ummm‚Ä¶well its our anniversary.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my god! No, it cant be‚Ä¶‚Äù She looked at the calendar on her phone to check, ‚ÄúOh my god it is! Shit, sorry, I forgot.‚Äù She looked slightly sheepish as she looked at him.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay‚Äù David said as he stroked her hair, ‚ÄúI just thought‚Ä¶I wanted you to have a good day!‚Äù

‚ÄúAwwwww, you‚Äôre a real darling, you know that. I can be such a bitch sometimes but you‚Äôre always so devoted to me.‚Äù Emily‚Äôs whole demeanour softened.

‚ÄúI love you so much Emily‚Äù David spoke with such feeling. He could feel his heart heavy with love and desire.

‚ÄúI know you do, you little romantic thing!‚Äù Emily giggled and tapped his nose with her index finger playfully. He noticed that she hadn‚Äôt said that she loved him back. He knew she did. He just wished sometimes she would tell him more often.

She tore open the wrapping paper and gazed in disbelief at the diamond necklace that was revealed.

‚ÄúOh my god, I love it, its stunning.‚Äù She grinned widely as she examined it closely. It was decadent, gorgeous, eye catching but without being gaudy or over the top. David felt it suited Emily perfectly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you like it!‚Äù David said, grinning ear to ear. Seeing Emily happy, especially happy with him was the best experience of his life. Nothing beats it, he thought to himself. Literally nothing. Emily came close to him, hugged him. She held him‚Äîfor a heartbeat, then two. David clung to that touch like a drowning man. Maybe tonight would be different. Maybe she saw him again.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre special to me David!‚Äù She whispered in his ear and he almost melted. His heart was overflowing. He loved her so much.

And just like that it was done. Finished. Emily leaned back on the sofa and went back to her phone. To go from such a high back down to earth was hard for David. The romance, the love, the evening‚Äôs momentum seemed to have just dissipated. The necklace had cost him a lot. A few thousand dollars. He didn‚Äôt mind the money. He just had hoped her joy would have lasted longer.

His eyes fell upon the unopened letter with its tender poem inside. The letter lying on the coffee table next to Emily‚Äôs boots. He had been nervous and excited for her to read what he had written. It had taken him hours of drafting and redrafting. But she couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to tear it open.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm cooking your favourite meal Babe!‚Äù Emily remained focussed on her phone, ‚ÄúBabe!‚Äù He spoke again. ‚ÄúEmily?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù Emily shot back at him and his heart skipped a beat. She was annoyed now. He‚Äôd fucked it up. Why did he have to be so annoying. Why couldn‚Äôt he just leave her alone sometimes. His self-doubting thoughts swirled round his head.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶I‚Äôm really sorry‚Ä¶I was just saying that I was making Monkfish‚Ä¶for our anniversary, the way you like it.‚Äù He spoke timidly, not able to meet her eye.

‚ÄúWell you should have said something, you should have asked David!‚Äù She spoke irritably, ‚ÄúI fancy Pizza tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yes of course, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù He knew he‚Äôd ruined the evening and he hated himself for it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go and order us a couple of pizzas and I‚Äôll go and pick it up so you don‚Äôt have to wait.‚Äù He remembered the last time he had kept his beloved wife waiting for her food when she was hungry; he had had to sleep on the couch for a week. He walked towards the phone in the hallway but was stopped in his tracks by his wife shouting out ‚ÄúMore Wine!‚Äù He felt a wave of nausea and dread. He was always shocked at how quickly Emily‚Äôs mood could change but he rushed to get the bottle and topped up her glass.

He then called the local pizza restaurant and before heading out to the car to pick it up, he decided to pick up all the petals he had placed leading to the bedroom‚Ä¶something told him that tonight wasn‚Äôt going to be the night for love.",1,1745156922.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

**The Kendu Brand**

Kendu is still a memecoin at heart there is no doubt about it, but we are also a Brand. Under this brand, community members have pursued their passions like creating Kendu Pendants or making murals(the full list will be shown below). When you release a product or create murals or songs you are releasing your creation to an already established user base who will be more than grateful for your contributions. At Kendu there is no ‚Äúteam‚Äù, we are a decentralised movement that is pushing in all directions to take Kendu to the tens of billions.

[Kendu Mural at Florida Groves Festival](https://preview.redd.it/cyhy5pgxuzve1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fca0523fc2cd43030ef3960a0d2f8ef277941550)

Here is a list of the current Kendu IRL initiatives:

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks. I think it will be available on Steam. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals!

**How will Kendu help you**

Kendu has around 18k holders and a vast majority are very active, we will support your social media posts and give you a crazy amount of free advertisement and engagement. If it is product based you will also have a steady flow of orders which will only pick up as Kendu grows. Being part of the Kendu community is worth way more than just money, it is also a home where you can pursue passions and make friends.

Here are some examples you can do with Kendu Creator:

* Breakdance
* Parkour
* Singing
* Playing Guitar

Here are some examples of products:

* Kendu Aftershave
* Kendu Chocolate
* Kendu lollipop

**Why Kendu**

Kendu has an enormous catalogue of IRL accomplishments and a social media presence to rival the very biggest in the space all at a market cap of 13 million, all of these initiatives have been completed when holders are in the red, imagine the volume and quality when everyone has an insane amount of money to invest???  
Kendu has an A rating on Certik and achieved the Certik audit by reaching 50k votes, the only other coin to reach this feat was Pepe! Certik is a security based company and is very, very reputable within the crypto community, you can this here: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu)  
Look at Shiba Inu in 2021 or Pepe, they didn‚Äôt have a KOL or anything special, it was just an average coin with an obsessed, relentless community who stopped at nothing to take it to the top. Kendu is no different in terms of relying on the power of an incredible community, however we are bringing to the table a lot more than those coins did, we are arriving with an IRL presence that is¬†**unprecedented.**¬†If you are reading this and you are not a Kendu holder, my advice to you would be to go on Twitter or Reddit and look around, you will see Kendu everywhere. Also, I‚Äôd recommend you join our telegram and check out our activity compared to coins that are in the hundreds of millions.  
The goal is simple and the path is clear, Kendu will be one of the top performers this cycle, this is not a coin to ignore‚Ä¶.

I don't have kids, and exclusively date men who don't, so based on this sentence in his profile, I thought he didn't have kids either. We met up, had coffee, and had a chat. He said that previously he dated a ""single mother"" (in his words, she had shared custody, though), and it wasn't for him because he likes how childless women have more time to work out and spend time with him. Okay, I already got a bit of an icky feeling then based on this comment, but then this dude goes on to confess that he has TWO KIDS himself. Then he said he didn't want to tell about it right away, because we should ""get to know each other"" first.

I am just tired. Why do some people think that they can set certain rules for others that they're not willing to fulfill themselves? Smh. It's not the first time I've encountered this either.

I smiled as I looked at my phone. Stephanie had confirmed that she would meet me later that day for what was going to be our first date. It was also, to my shame, going to be the first time that I was going on a date with any woman. I'd always been quite timid, and lacked any real self confidence, but Steph had evidently sensed that and been the one to ask me out.



With little to no idea of how I actually should act, I was on my way to see my best friend, Eliza. Eliza and I had been friends since childhood. Eliza was everything I was not, confident, loud and rather brash. She had been a tomboy when we were younger and even as an adult, she was definitely still very masculine leaning. I had never once seen her in a dress or skirt. Sure enough, as I pulled up on her driveway, she was waiting for me in one of her Fulham FC replica shirts and a pair of smart jeans. As usual, she greeted me with a fist bump.



""So, let's have a coffee, Shane, and then I'll see what I can do in getting you prepared for this date. What can you tell me about this Steph?"" Eliza began, filling her kettle with some water and switching it on.



""I mean, she's nice. She seems kind, I think she quite likes animals. She has a couple of cute little cats,"" I answered.



""You and fucking cats! I don't think that's the kind of pussy that you should have in mind when you're on your date tonight!"" Eliza teased, rolling her eyes. My love for cute animals often seemed to almost embarrass Eliza.



I felt myself blushing. ""We're not going to fuck tonight! I'm not like you, 'liza. And Steph isn't one of your floozies,"" I squeaked. Eliza always seemed to be bringing a new partner to her house, but she never seemed to be able to stay in a relationship for long.



""So I had an idea for how I can help you. It's a little bit out of the box, but hear me out. I thought, let's pretend you're Steph. I'll treat you how I think she would like to be treated, I'll show you what to do. But we should really get you into character. I left something in my downstairs bathroom that should help with that,"" Eliza stated in the serious tone she always used when she wanted to get me to do something. 



Taking a large sip of coffee, I went into the downstairs 'bathroom', which was really just a toilet and wash basin. Sure enough, hung on the side of a mirror was a sleek red dress.



""'liza, what the fuck? You want me to wear this?"" I called out.



""Steph's not going to turn up in a t-shirt and jeans. I don't expect so, anyway!"" Eliza answered. It appeared she was waiting for me on the other side of the door.



Shrugging, I wondered what I was getting myself into as I shed my clothes and reached for the dress. As I slid it on, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the soft material as it made contact with my skin. I briefly thought to myself that it would have felt even better if I had shaved my legs. The dress fell to just below my thighs, it was certainly quite sensuous, probably more revealing that what I had pictured Steph would wear.



""Well, well, well, hello there beautiful!"" Eliza announced as I exited the bathroom with more than a little trepidation. Before I could do anything, she whipped her hand out from behind her back and presented me with a bouquet of flowers.



As I studied the flowers and Eliza's rather interesting facial expression, I started to feel a warm feeling deep inside me.



""Oh, you didn't need to do that, 'liza,"" I finally managed to say as I accepted the flowers.



""You wanted to know how to treat a girl. You should always get her flowers, especially on the first date!"" Eliza explained. ""Just imagine I'm a guy,"" she continued.



I wanted to say that imagining Eliza as a guy was not a stretch, but I didn't fancy the playful swat to the arm such a remark would likely have earned me.



""Okay, now, I'll show you how to escort a lady. Just hold onto my shoulder, we'll pretend the kitchen is wherever fancy pants place you're taking Steph,"" Eliza instructed, holding out her arm. I accepted it, linking up and holding onto her shoulder. 



Without ceremony, Eliza escorted me back into the kitchen. She pulled my chair out for me. ""For the prettiest thing in the room,"" she declared as she did this.



I took my seat, tucking my legs under the table. I reached for my coffee, finding that my hands were shaking a little.



""I don't want you looking at other guys tonight. I'm going to show you a great time,"" Eliza purred, oozing confidence as she took her seat opposite mine.



I could no longer deny it. I was fast becoming attracted to a side of Eliza that I had perhaps not seen before. 



""It's just, you're so cute. I really don't anyone else trying to steal you away. And you really do look good in that dress, Shane,"" Eliza admitted, staring straight at me.



""'liza. I need to tell you something,"" I babbled. I could feel myself enamoured by Eliza, wanting her to take things further. To seal the deal.

1k3mv3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/1k3mv3t/please_help_noaaepa/,Please help NOAA/EPA,"The administration's 2026 budget passback plan, currently under consideration, eliminates NOAA's Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) Office and its 10 research laboratories and 16 affiliated Cooperative Institutes, and moves the few remaining research efforts to different NOAA departments. If enacted, the passback would close all of NOAA‚Äôs weather, climate, and ocean Laboratories and Cooperative Institutes.

 

The speed at which these decisions are being made translates into little to no opportunity for feedback or consideration of long-term impacts. Without NOAA research, National Weather Service (NWS) weather models and products will stagnate, observational data collection will be reduced, public outreach will decrease, undergraduate and graduate student support will drop, and NOAA funding for universities will plummet. In effect, the scientific backbone and workforce needed to keep weather forecasts, alerts, and warnings accurate and effective will be drastically undercut, with unknown ‚Äî yet almost certainly disastrous ‚Äî consequences for public safety and economic health.

 

As key stakeholders, AMS and NWA stand ready to provide our expertise so that the U.S. can maintain its competitiveness in the years ahead.

 

If you believe in the importance of NOAA research for maintaining and improving NWS forecasts and services to the nation then the time to act is now. Reach out to your elected representatives and share your concerns.

 

To envision the disastrous impact of this plan, one only needs to see what NOAA research has provided to the U.S. taxpayer and imagine where we would be without it. For example, the work of NOAA Research Labs and Cooperative Institutes:

Sparked and developed our national Doppler radar network. NOAA research proved that Doppler weather radars are critical for severe thunderstorm warnings. This research led directly to the creation of the national Doppler weather radar network, which provides the radar observations you see on television and on your phone, and which meteorologists use to keep you safe during hazardous and severe weather. The next generation of weather radar is now being developed in the same laboratories.
Feeds National Weather Service forecasts. NOAA research created and continuously improves the two computer weather models used by the National Weather Service to generate hourly and daily weather forecasts. One model focuses on predicting severe weather and is used extensively by the transportation and energy sectors. Another model predicts global weather patterns across the world for the 3- to 14-day range, with forecast outlooks used by farmers, ranchers, and water managers.
Helps us respond to hurricanes. The NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft that fly into Atlantic Ocean hurricanes collect essential observations to improve forecasts of hurricane landfall location and intensity, leading to better evacuation decisions and emergency response. This directly impacts public safety during extreme weather events.
Helps us track airborne hazards. NOAA research developed and continuously improves models to track the release of hazardous materials, including toxins, wildfire smoke, and volcanic ash, to keep people out of danger ‚Äî as well as creating specialized instruments to detect those airborne hazards.
Keeps water treatment plants on track. NOAA implemented and operates a lake hypoxia warning system to help keep drinking water potable in the Great Lakes region.
Warns communities of tsunamis. NOAA researchers developed and maintain the real-time tsunami monitoring system that plays a critical role in tsunami forecasting and helps keep coastal communities safe.
Helps farmers and managers plan. NOAA created and runs an El Ni√±o information system to assist in seasonal forecasting of temperature and rainfall across the U.S. This helps farmers, ranchers, water managers, and electric utility companies make better decisions.
Keeps water supplies more secure. NOAA research developed and continuously advances water information systems to better manage large reservoirs that supply water to towns, cities, and farmers across the nation.
Addresses climate change. NOAA research has developed and improved climate models, the U.S. Climate Reference Network, and monitoring stations to learn about our changing climate and its causes.
Imagine what will happen to tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings if we don‚Äôt have a robust national weather radar network? What will happen to reservoir management when critical information on rainfall and runoff goes missing? What will happen when Hurricane Hunter aircraft are delayed or data from their instruments are not available to improve hurricane track and landfall forecasts? NOAA research affects the lives of American taxpayers every day. It is vital to the work of the National Weather Service and the NOAA mission to predict the environment and share that information with businesses, communities, state and local governments, and citizens.

 

NOAA Research costs every American citizen less than a cup of coffee a year, with large returns on this small investment. This is a prime example of effective government ‚Äî one that helps grow the economy and keeps people safe.

If you‚Äôre planning to start a small business in Dubai and don‚Äôt know where to begin, try thinking about location-based demand. Some businesses grow fast just because they‚Äôre in the right place. 

Here are 15 practical ideas I‚Äôve seen working really well here:

	1.	Open a cafeteria in a tourist spot or commercial office area. Perfect for coffee, sandwiches, and snacks.

	2.	Start a flower and fruit shop near a hospital. Visitors and patients‚Äô families often buy them daily.

	3.	Juice bar next to a gym. Serve protein shakes, smoothies, and detox drinks to fitness lovers.

	4.	Stationery and printing shop near schools or colleges. Students need daily supplies and quick prints.

	5.	Fast food kiosk in industrial areas. Great for quick, budget-friendly meals for workers.

	6.	Pet grooming or pet supply store in residential communities. Pet owners love convenience.

	7.	Mini supermarket inside a residential building or neighborhood. Essentials are always in demand.

	8.	Pharmacy near a clinic or diagnostic lab. Consistent footfall from patients and caretakers.

	9.	Laundry service near hostels, labor camps, or shared housing. High weekly usage and easy operations.

	10.	Gift shop near event halls or schools. Celebrations and birthdays keep the demand high.

	11.	Car wash near parking zones or malls. People love getting their car cleaned while they shop.

	12.	Mobile accessories shop near metro stations or colleges. Earphones, chargers, and quick tech fixes.

	13.	Bakery in a residential zone or school area. Cakes, snacks, and good coffee bring people in.

	14.	Fruit and vegetable cart near apartment complexes. Fresh produce delivered to the doorstep.

	15.	Gents or ladies salon in neighborhood blocks. Grooming is a regular need for most people.

What makes it the perfect tariff play is that, first of all, food stocks are extremely safe during recessions. At the end of the day, people still have to eat. Second of all, Coffee prices could skyrocket because of Tariffs. Not only can we not grow coffee in the United States, but we can't grow chocolate and vanilla. You need tropical climates to grow these products, and the crops need intensive labor. Madesgar grows most of the vanilla we buy, and we currently have a 47% tariff on them.

Here‚Äôs your curated on-ramp. These posts give you tone, character, lore, and momentum.

1. **The Curse of the Pharaoh‚Äôs Mask** *(Season 1, Ep 1)*
   - The one that started it all. A cursed relic. A botched theft. A mummy with an agenda.

2. **A Manner Darkly** *(Season 4, Ep 2)*
   - Minx and Blue Puppy try to keep a town under control while Mouse Capone is away. It goes poorly.

3. **Nighttime in the Temple of the Moon** *(Season 2, Ep 10)*
   - The ancient moon temple. Sabotage. Shadows. And a calm resolve at the center of madness.

4. **Nighttime in the Temple of the Sun** *(Season 2, Ep 11)*
   - Mouse Capone finds himself replacing Atlas. For a while. It‚Äôs exactly as literal as it sounds.

5. **Epilogue II: The Storyteller‚Äôs Ink** *(Season 3 Finale)*
   - Flight, quiet, memory. A rare moment of peace in the long run.

**Suggested Reading Style:**
Non-linear. Think story quilt. Jump around. Let tone guide you. When in doubt, follow the hat.

More chaos drops and visual expansions are posted regularly on the hdfidelity subreddit. Feel free to reach out, drop theories, or join the crew.

Just remember: nobody *ever* really knows what time it is.

*‚ÄúTrust the current. Hold the branch. Keep going.‚Äù*

**START HERE: JESS BEYOND REPAIR**

*There‚Äôs blood on the ledger and lipstick on the porcelain. The Countess takes her coffee black and her grudges long.*

**Jess Beyond Repair** is a street-noir tragicomedy set in the crumbling halls of aristocracy. Countess Jessica Harrow‚Äîwidow, regulator, velvet fist‚Äîis the kind of woman who lights a match before asking where the fuse is. By day, she tends to her estate and keeps the estate‚Äôs chaos at bay. By night, she handles road-level conflict with a crowbar, cold wit, and a smile that means business.

It‚Äôs dark, stylish, and morally askew. Think Fleabag if she ran a manor and enforced local order like a benevolent gangster.

---

**What‚Äôs the vibe?**
- *Fleabag* meets *Peaky Blinders* with a splash of *Dead to Me*  
- *Heirloom trauma and street code in eveningwear*  
- *Black humor, class tension, sibling grief, and poorly iced cake*

---

**Main Players:**
- **Countess Jessica Harrow** ‚Äì widow, noble, and possibly the only reason half the region hasn‚Äôt burned down yet
- **Her sister-in-law** ‚Äì a silent storm of judgment living under the same roof
- **The Niece** ‚Äì a Scouse brat with a sweet tooth and a sharp tongue
- **The Officers, the Old Money, and the Rats** ‚Äì those who seek her favor, or her ruin

---

**Where to begin:**
Slide into the silk-and-ash of it all:

1. **The Velvet Favor** ‚Äì A request is made. Jess does not say yes. She delivers anyway.

2. **The Cake Incident** ‚Äì The niece is not to be trifled with. Or left unsupervised.

3. **The Library Argument** ‚Äì Legacy, language, and a ledger out of place.

4. **Jess and the Street** ‚Äì A flashback. A reckoning. A crowbar.

5. **The Dinner That Wasn‚Äôt** ‚Äì A social engagement derails. An arrangement is solidified in silence.

---

**Suggested Reading Style:**
Late night. A glass of something bitter. Read fast, then read it again. She talks with her eyes.

More fragments, fables, and firecracker dialogue drop when you least expect them. hdfidelity always has a seat at the table.

*‚ÄúYou can inherit land. You earn fear.‚Äù*

**START HERE: MEANWHILE AT THE ABBEY**

*The rain never quite lets up. The tea is always just about to steep. The past isn‚Äôt past‚Äîit‚Äôs walking the cloisters.*

**Meanwhile at the Abbey** is a slow-burning period chamber drama set in and around L‚ÄôAvon Abbey, a centuries-old religious order tangled in inheritance law, grief, prophecy, and petty rivalries. It‚Äôs a place where quiet glances carry meaning, and sermons cut deeper than politics.

If you‚Äôve ever wanted to sip storm-chilled cider while unraveling a minor theological betrayal that snowballs into generational fracture‚Äîwelcome home.

---

**What‚Äôs the vibe?**
- *The Crown* meets *The Leftovers*  
- *Chamber drama with spiritual weight*

- **Father DeJohn** ‚Äì the sharpest tongue in the sermon circuit, both feared and admired
- **The Duke** ‚Äì unseen more than seen, but casting a long shadow across the river
- **The Abbey Itself** ‚Äì a character in all but name, with its own quiet, watching memory

---

**Where to begin:**
Your meditative entry point, if you please:

1. **The Sunday Sermon After** ‚Äì Father DeJohn delivers a subtle rebuke to unseen ears, and everyone pretends not to notice.

2. **Brother Aelius‚Äôs Retreat** ‚Äì Alone among the books and rain, the youngest monk begins to unravel.

3. **The Discussion in the Dining Hall** ‚Äì The elder brothers speculate with wit, concern, and veiled tones.

4. **The Question of Chapel Road** ‚Äì A reflection on the town, its naming, and how memory takes hold.

5. **A Map of the Abbey** ‚Äì Orientation by way of history and whisper.

---

**Suggested Reading Style:**
Quiet evening. Low light. Let the subtext rise. The Abbey is best visited unhurried.

**START HERE: PUERTO RICANS IN SPACE**

*Welcome to the Freehold. You‚Äôre already late.*

Puerto Ricans in Space is a political sci-fi epic set in the 23rd century, where Puerto Rico has become a constitutional monarchy with a powerful space program, rival kingdoms, and colonial scars that haven‚Äôt fully healed. At its core, this story is about espionage, expansion, identity, and the cost of vision.

If you‚Äôve ever wanted to watch a prince trade secrets with corrupt trade barons while an exiled spy sabotages launch systems on a Martian border colony‚Äîyou‚Äôre in the right place.

- **Brandt** ‚Äì the foreign-born adventure capitalist with imperial designs and a network of sabotage agents
- **The Senate & Lords** ‚Äì divided, scheming, deeply entrenched; some want the future, others just want to survive it
- **External Powers** ‚Äì Spain, the U.S., and Russia watch the Martian Freehold like hungry sharks

---

**Where to begin:**
Here‚Äôs your curated access ramp into the tangled orbit.

1. **The Salted Earth (Part I)** ‚Äì The sabotage begins. The cracks in the program appear. Sebasti√°n receives his first whisper of Brandt‚Äôs betrayal.

2. **The Salted Earth (Part II)** ‚Äì Counter-investigation and confrontation. The quiet chess match escalates.

3. **The Salted Earth (Part III)** ‚Äì Brandt maneuvers in desperation as Sebasti√°n solidifies power.

**START HERE: THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY NATIONS**

*At the turn of the 20th century, the world‚Äôs great powers secretly form a coalition of spies, scientists, mystics, and soldiers‚Äînot to prevent war, but to delay the apocalypse.*

**The League of Extraordinary Nations** is a geopolitical pulp adventure that blends the intrigue of early 20th century diplomacy with the absurdity of forgotten technology, supernatural echoes of colonial sin, and the delicate art of espionage in a world that refuses to stay rational.

It‚Äôs The Grand Budapest Hotel with a diplomatic passport and a flamethrower briefcase. Stylish. Cerebral. Tongue in cheek. Completely committed to the bit.

---

**What‚Äôs the vibe?**
- *The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen* meets *The Man from U.N.C.L.E.* by way of *Hellboy*  
- *World‚Äôs Fairs, exorcist diplomats, art heists, and cursed telegrams*  
- *Historical absurdism meets occult pragmatism*  

---

**Key Operatives:**
- **Agent R‚Äî** Britain‚Äôs liaison with a monocle and a mood
- **Madame Soule** ‚Äì France‚Äôs telepathic archivist (allegedly retired, absolutely not)
- **The Mongolian Concordat** ‚Äì An entire thread built around a secret summit that never officially happened
- **The Kaiser‚Äôs Ghost** ‚Äì A recurring enemy/ally depending on the spectral weather

---

**Where to begin:**
The file cabinet opens here:

1. **The Zimmermann Telegram Revisited** ‚Äì A double-bluff, a double agent, and a train that shouldn‚Äôt exist

2. **The Mongolian Concordat** ‚Äì A summit in the high steppes where no one speaks first

3. **The Dutch Shipyard Incident** ‚Äì Sabotage, steam-powered divers, and a clock counting backward

4. **The Janus Letters** ‚Äì Two identical messages sent to two enemies. One ends a war. The other starts a curse.

---

**Suggested Reading Style:**
Lean into the pulp. Imagine a creased manila file folder under your arm. Sip something strong. Laugh once. Then keep reading.

Dispatches from this world drop irregularly on hdfidelity, usually when the weather shifts and a treaty expires.

Hey everyone,
Lately, I've been experiencing a series of strange events that have made me seriously question the nature of reality‚Äîand whether what we call ""reality"" might actually be some kind of simulation. These experiences feel like perceptual glitches or shifts in the system, as if I‚Äôm brushing up against the edges of the program or stepping slightly outside of the rendered world. Here are some of the most striking anomalies I‚Äôve encountered recently:


---

1. Shifting Dimensions and Language Overlays
While walking through my neighborhood, I‚Äôve suddenly found myself surrounded by people speaking entirely different languages‚ÄîSpanish, Russian‚Äîas if I‚Äôd entered a different layer of reality or a parallel version of my own city. The environment even felt subtly different, like the assets had been swapped out.



2. People Vanishing Mid-Scene
On several occasions, I‚Äôve focused my intent on people around me and they‚Äôve simply disappeared from my perception. It‚Äôs not that they walked away‚ÄîI mean gone, like they were de-rendered or removed from the instance I was in.



3. Invisibility or De-Synced Presence
I've shouted in crowded public spaces and no one reacted. It felt like I was invisible or existing on a different layer of the simulation, temporarily unlinked from others‚Äô awareness.



4. Spontaneous Object Rendering
While sitting alone in a park, I saw a monument appear in front of me. I don‚Äôt know if it was visible to others, but it seemed to materialize out of nowhere‚Äîas if something in the environment was loaded in just for me.



5. Dancing Stars and Cosmic Code
One night, I saw stars moving rapidly, zigzagging and spiraling in ways that defied physics. It felt like I was seeing behind the curtain‚Äîcosmic-scale variables being manipulated in real-time.



6. Sensory Anomalies: Phantom Smells
I‚Äôve picked up distinct smells‚Äîfloral, smoky, electric‚Äîcoming from nowhere. No physical source, no explanation. Just a strong sensory input injected into the moment, like a data packet meant to trigger awareness.



7. Time-Space Glitches: Waking Up Elsewhere
Once I fell asleep in one place and woke up somewhere else without any recollection of how I got there. No drugs, no sleepwalking history‚Äîjust a clean break in the timeline. Like I was paused, moved, and resumed.



8. The Man with No Legs (and Then Legs)
I saw a man without legs lying by a traffic light. Minutes later, I saw the same man walking down the street like nothing had happened. Either reality rewrote itself‚Äîor I shifted to a different version of it.



9. Spirit Animal Guidance in Dangerous Terrain
In a sketchy part of town, I felt guided by an inner voice or energy in the form of an owl‚Äîleading me toward danger rather than away. I trusted it, and everything aligned perfectly. As I emerged safely, the final ‚Äúconfirmation‚Äù was seeing a nearby shop named ‚ÄúŒºŒ±Œ≥ŒµŒØŒ±‚Äù (Greek for ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù). It felt scripted, like a simulation checkpoint.



10. Architecture Shifts: Monuments and Buildings Changing
Several statues in my area have changed positions or appearance overnight. I‚Äôve also seen new buildings appear out of nowhere‚Äîplaces that didn‚Äôt exist the day before. No construction, no warning‚Äîjust rendered into existence.



11. Rapid Language Switching in Real-Time
One afternoon while out for coffee, a man sitting near me began speaking aloud‚Äîand within seconds, he was rapidly shifting between three or four different languages. It didn‚Äôt feel real at all, more like a broken audio track or a loop in the simulation struggling to stabilize.




---

Conclusion: Cracks in the Simulation?
These moments feel like reality stuttering, revealing its synthetic underpinnings. Whether it's a simulation, a multiverse overlap, or a shift in consciousness, I‚Äôm convinced that what we experience isn‚Äôt fixed. I‚Äôm learning to work with these shifts rather than dismiss them‚Äîand it‚Äôs changed how I view the world.



I‚Äôd love to know if anyone else has experienced similar phenomena‚Äîdimension shifts, time glitches, sensory anomalies, or reality rewrites. Are we all picking up on the edges of the code?",1,1745155853.0,SimulationTheory,0,1.0,False

Thinking of turning your passion for coffee into a business? Starting a coffee shop in Dubai can be exciting, but there are a few important steps to get it right. Here‚Äôs a friendly, step-by-step guide to help you get started.

Step 1: Start with Your Concept
Before anything else, get clear on your vision. Are you dreaming of a cozy specialty caf√©, a grab and go espresso bar, or a trendy spot with desserts and snacks? Your concept will shape your budget, design, and target audience.

Step 2: Find the Right Spot
Location can make or break your caf√©. Look for areas with good foot traffic like near offices, residential zones, or malls. Make sure the space complies with Dubai Municipality‚Äôs health and safety standards too.

Step 3: Register Your Trade Name
Pick a catchy, unique name for your coffee shop and reserve it with Dubai‚Äôs Department of Economic Development (DED).

Step 4: Apply for Initial Approval
Submit your business plan and other basic documents to DED. This gives you the green light to move ahead with the setup.

Step 5: Get Your Coffee Shop License
You‚Äôll need a commercial license. Most coffee shops in Dubai get a cafeteria or restaurant license, depending on the size and menu. If you‚Äôre planning to sell coffee beans or packaged goods, you may need an extra activity added.

Step 6: Get the Food Safety Approvals
Dubai Municipality will review and approve your kitchen design, storage areas, and hygiene setup. They‚Äôll likely inspect the space before giving you final approval.

Step 7: Start Your Fit-Out
Once you get the go-ahead, you can begin designing your caf√©. This includes furniture, kitchen equipment, branding, and lighting. Everything should match the approved layout and health regulations.

Step 8: Hire and Onboard Your Team
Baristas, chefs, waiters  hire people who share your passion. Apply for their visas and get their Emirates ID and medical fitness test done.

Step 9: Open Your Business Bank Account
After your license is issued, you can open a corporate bank account to manage payments, salaries, and other transactions smoothly.

Step 10: Get Ready to Launch
Finalize your menu, get your POS system in place, and start promoting your brand online. Don‚Äôt forget to register with delivery apps like Talabat, Deliveroo, and Noon Food if you plan to offer delivery.",1,1745155593.0,SmallBusinessUAE,0,1.0,False
1k3mh84,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1k3mh84/the_forest_that_grew_in_my_apartment/,The Forest That Grew in My Apartment,"
The morning felt wrong, but not in a dramatic way. Just‚Ä¶ off.

I woke to the soft hum of my old box fan and an odd, sour yellow light leaking through the blinds. I checked my phone‚Äî7:42 a.m.‚Äîbut the alarm hadn‚Äôt gone off. No notifications. No updates. Just that hollow, quiet screen.

The apartment felt heavier than usual. Still air. Dry mouth. Static in my hair. I chalked it up to a poor night‚Äôs sleep and shuffled toward the kitchen.

That‚Äôs when I noticed the first one.

A sprout‚Äîno taller than my pinky‚Äîhad pushed up from a crack in the floorboard. Bright green. Soft-edged. The kind of thing you‚Äôd see in a time-lapse documentary. I stared, bleary-eyed.

Maybe a seed dropped through a vent. Maybe something left behind by the last tenant. I plucked it out, tossed it in the trash, and forgot about it by the time the coffee finished brewing.

‚∏ª

I forgot about the sprout. Days have been bleeding together lately, and it didn‚Äôt seem worth remembering.

But the next morning, it was back.

Same corner. Same crack. This time, with company‚Äîtwo more little shoots, thin and curled, like fingers reaching for the heater. I crouched down. The floor felt soft underfoot. Not wet. Just‚Ä¶ loose.

I yanked the sprouts out again, more annoyed than anything. I meant to clean. I didn‚Äôt.

That night, the kitchen lights flickered. Barely perceptible, but there‚Äîa soft twitch, like an eyelid about to blink. The light was dimmer than usual. That same pale yellow haze.

I made a mental note to check the breaker and didn‚Äôt.

‚∏ª

Next morning, the sprouts had grown.

A vine trailed along the baseboard, curling toward the fridge. A single leaf had unfurled.

I hesitated. Got down on my knees and touched it. Cool. Damp. A little fuzzy, like moss. I tugged. It resisted. I pulled harder. It tore with a sound I didn‚Äôt like.

I threw it away. Again.

‚∏ª

Later, brushing my teeth, I noticed something else.

The mirror was fogged‚Äînot from steam, but like the inside of a windshield. I wiped it. It smeared. Left a faint greenish streak on my towel.

No open windows. No leaks.

That night, I heard buzzing. A fly looping around the hallway light. I hadn‚Äôt opened a window in weeks.

‚∏ª

The floor‚Äôs definitely off now. Slight give, like packed earth under a blanket. My socks came away damp. I peeled up the corner of the carpet.

Dark. Moist. No mold. No subfloor. Just soft soil and tiny white roots.

I should‚Äôve been alarmed.

I wasn‚Äôt.

‚∏ª

More sprouts. More vines. Now curling around the fridge and creeping through the cabinets. Moss growing in the shower tiles. Something leafy sprouting in the back of the fridge‚Äîlike ferns.

I cleaned it. Scrubbed. Bleached everything.

The next day, it came back worse.

‚∏ª

It‚Äôs been a week. Maybe two.

My phone still turns on. Still charges. I can scroll through old messages. But no calls go through. Just endless ringing. No voicemails. No responses.

I tried texting:
‚ÄúHey, you ever seen moss grow in a fridge?‚Äù
‚ÄúWanna come over? Something weird‚Äôs happening.‚Äù

No replies. No read receipts.

‚∏ª

I walked down the hall to knock on my neighbor‚Äôs door.

The hallway stretched longer than it should‚Äôve. The lights above buzzed and blinked like dying insects. I never reached her door. The hallway narrowed. Folded in on itself.

I turned around.

‚∏ª

The smell doesn‚Äôt bother me anymore. Damp soil. Cut grass.

Moss crawls up the bathroom walls like wallpaper in reverse. Ferns grow from the soap dish. I tried scrubbing again, but the sponge disintegrated in my hand.

Two nights ago, a bird nested in the bathroom vent. Just stared at me. Perfectly still.

I didn‚Äôt bother it. It didn‚Äôt bother me.

‚∏ª

The fridge hums like it‚Äôs alive.

Milk sours in a day. Mushrooms bloom in the drawers‚Äîpale, fat, open like mouths. I throw them out. They return.

I‚Äôve stopped cleaning.

The vines always come back. Stronger. Faster.

I step over thick roots like they belong. I sit at my desk and pretend I still live in an apartment.

‚∏ª

This morning, a leaf on my pillow. Long. Wet with dew. I flushed it, but it twirled in the water like it didn‚Äôt want to leave.

I think the forest is learning the shape of me.

The clocks tick, but never agree. Microwave: 3:09. Stove: 11:52. Phone: ‚ÄúSearching‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚∏ª

Outside the windows: no street. No buildings. Just forest. Towering trees. Glass fogs up if I look too long. Sometimes I see movement. Shapes between trunks.

Light changes without warning. Morning bleeds into dusk.

Lamps flicker even when unplugged.

‚∏ª

Last night: voices.

Not loud‚Äîwhispers through wood. Chanting. Maybe my name.

When I woke up‚Äîif I slept‚Äîthere was a second door.

Identical to my front door. But black. No knob. Just a keyhole.

I didn‚Äôt touch it.

‚∏ª

Mushrooms again. A perfect circle on the living room carpet. I stepped around them.

The bird in the vent chirped when I spoke. When I laughed, it mimicked the sound.

‚∏ª

I opened the second door.

No hallway. No stairwell.

A classroom. My desk. A projector flickering. A younger me, pushing a crying boy I used to bully.

I tried to scream. My throat was moss.

When I shut the door, my walls were wet.

‚∏ª

There‚Äôs no ceiling now. Just branches. Tall. Ancient. Swaying slowly, like underwater trees. Sometimes stars beyond them. Sometimes eyes.

The door never closed again. It stays ajar. Sometimes I hear footsteps behind it. Small. Familiar.

My shelves collapsed under vines. My bed is gone.

I sleep on a patch of moss that hums when I lie still.

‚∏ª

This morning: a circle of stones around my body.

My hands folded over my chest. Fingernails packed with dirt.

I didn‚Äôt do that.

At least‚ÄîI don‚Äôt remember doing it.

‚∏ª

Today, something in the window.

Not through it. In it.

My reflection didn‚Äôt move. It stared back‚Äîcalm, still. Leaves grew from its shoulders. Bark traced its jawline.

Its mouth didn‚Äôt move, but I heard something:

‚ÄúYou were already here.‚Äù

‚∏ª

The vines are inside me now. I feel them in my ribs.

I cough up spores. The bird is gone. But wings still flap behind the walls.

I think the forest is done waiting.

‚∏ª

I don‚Äôt remember typing this.

Or maybe I always was.

Maybe this isn‚Äôt posting. Maybe you‚Äôre not real.

But if you‚Äôre reading this, I need you to understand:

I didn‚Äôt ask for this.

I didn‚Äôt go outside. I didn‚Äôt touch anything. I just‚Ä¶ slept.

And something grew in my apartment.

Until it wasn‚Äôt an apartment anymore.

Until there was only green. And silence.
And the sound of something very old saying my name like it was part of a root system.

‚∏ª

If this ever happens to you:
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt open the second door.
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt touch the leaves.
	‚Ä¢	Never lie down with your eyes closed.

You might not wake up the same.

Or at all.

Hey,

So I‚Äôm in that stage where every day feels like a repeat button‚Äîwake up, grind, crash, repeat. It‚Äôs fine, productive even, but man, it gets a bit dull after a while. I figured maybe talking to someone new could help break that cycle a little.

I‚Äôd love to have someone to talk to regularly‚Äînothing intense, just someone to share everyday stuff with. Could be sending each other weird reels at 2am, talking about random thoughts, venting about life, or just swapping music recs. If you‚Äôre from Ahmedabad, even better‚Äîwe could hang out once in a while when time allows. If not, totally cool with keeping it online too.

I‚Äôm into films, music, manga, and I take my coffee a little too seriously (flat whites are the way).
	

Not really looking for anything specific‚Äîjust want to vibe, talk, see where things go. Could be a good friendship, maybe something more down the line if it clicks. Who knows?

If any of that sounds like your vibe, drop a message.
And hey‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the one song you‚Äôve had on repeat lately? Let‚Äôs start there.

The morning felt wrong, but not in a dramatic way. Just‚Ä¶ off.

I woke to the soft hum of my old box fan and an odd, sour yellow light leaking through the blinds. I checked my phone‚Äî7:42 a.m.‚Äîbut the alarm hadn‚Äôt gone off. No notifications. No updates. Just that hollow, quiet screen.

The apartment felt heavier than usual. Still air. Dry mouth. Static in my hair. I chalked it up to a poor night‚Äôs sleep and shuffled toward the kitchen.

That‚Äôs when I noticed the first one.

A sprout‚Äîno taller than my pinky‚Äîhad pushed up from a crack in the floorboard. Bright green. Soft-edged. The kind of thing you‚Äôd see in a time-lapse documentary. I stared, bleary-eyed.

Maybe a seed dropped through a vent. Maybe something left behind by the last tenant. I plucked it out, tossed it in the trash, and forgot about it by the time the coffee finished brewing.

‚∏ª

I forgot about the sprout. Days have been bleeding together lately, and it didn‚Äôt seem worth remembering.

But the next morning, it was back.

Same corner. Same crack. This time, with company‚Äîtwo more little shoots, thin and curled, like fingers reaching for the heater. I crouched down. The floor felt soft underfoot. Not wet. Just‚Ä¶ loose.

I yanked the sprouts out again, more annoyed than anything. I meant to clean. I didn‚Äôt.

That night, the kitchen lights flickered. Barely perceptible, but there‚Äîa soft twitch, like an eyelid about to blink. The light was dimmer than usual. That same pale yellow haze.

I made a mental note to check the breaker and didn‚Äôt.

‚∏ª

Next morning, the sprouts had grown.

A vine trailed along the baseboard, curling toward the fridge. A single leaf had unfurled.

I hesitated. Got down on my knees and touched it. Cool. Damp. A little fuzzy, like moss. I tugged. It resisted. I pulled harder. It tore with a sound I didn‚Äôt like.

I threw it away. Again.

‚∏ª

Later, brushing my teeth, I noticed something else.

The mirror was fogged‚Äînot from steam, but like the inside of a windshield. I wiped it. It smeared. Left a faint greenish streak on my towel.

No open windows. No leaks.

That night, I heard buzzing. A fly looping around the hallway light. I hadn‚Äôt opened a window in weeks.

‚∏ª

The floor‚Äôs definitely off now. Slight give, like packed earth under a blanket. My socks came away damp. I peeled up the corner of the carpet.

Dark. Moist. No mold. No subfloor. Just soft soil and tiny white roots.

I should‚Äôve been alarmed.

I wasn‚Äôt.

‚∏ª

More sprouts. More vines. Now curling around the fridge and creeping through the cabinets. Moss growing in the shower tiles. Something leafy sprouting in the back of the fridge‚Äîlike ferns.

I cleaned it. Scrubbed. Bleached everything.

The next day, it came back worse.

‚∏ª

It‚Äôs been a week. Maybe two.

My phone still turns on. Still charges. I can scroll through old messages. But no calls go through. Just endless ringing. No voicemails. No responses.

I tried texting:
‚ÄúHey, you ever seen moss grow in a fridge?‚Äù
‚ÄúWanna come over? Something weird‚Äôs happening.‚Äù

No replies. No read receipts.

‚∏ª

I walked down the hall to knock on my neighbor‚Äôs door.

The hallway stretched longer than it should‚Äôve. The lights above buzzed and blinked like dying insects. I never reached her door. The hallway narrowed. Folded in on itself.

I turned around.

‚∏ª

The smell doesn‚Äôt bother me anymore. Damp soil. Cut grass.

Moss crawls up the bathroom walls like wallpaper in reverse. Ferns grow from the soap dish. I tried scrubbing again, but the sponge disintegrated in my hand.

Two nights ago, a bird nested in the bathroom vent. Just stared at me. Perfectly still.

I didn‚Äôt bother it. It didn‚Äôt bother me.

‚∏ª

The fridge hums like it‚Äôs alive.

Milk sours in a day. Mushrooms bloom in the drawers‚Äîpale, fat, open like mouths. I throw them out. They return.

I‚Äôve stopped cleaning.

The vines always come back. Stronger. Faster.

I step over thick roots like they belong. I sit at my desk and pretend I still live in an apartment.

‚∏ª

This morning, a leaf on my pillow. Long. Wet with dew. I flushed it, but it twirled in the water like it didn‚Äôt want to leave.

I think the forest is learning the shape of me.

The clocks tick, but never agree. Microwave: 3:09. Stove: 11:52. Phone: ‚ÄúSearching‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚∏ª

Outside the windows: no street. No buildings. Just forest. Towering trees. Glass fogs up if I look too long. Sometimes I see movement. Shapes between trunks.

Light changes without warning. Morning bleeds into dusk.

Lamps flicker even when unplugged.

‚∏ª

Last night: voices.

Not loud‚Äîwhispers through wood. Chanting. Maybe my name.

When I woke up‚Äîif I slept‚Äîthere was a second door.

Identical to my front door. But black. No knob. Just a keyhole.

While my cat was doing its usual chaos, I somehow managed to spill a cup of coffee on my boyfriend's PC case. In a panic, we quickly powered it off, and I did my best to clean up the mess using paper towels. However, I noticed that some coffee had managed to seep into the GPU through a few small holes. I placed more paper towels inside to absorb the excess liquid and left it to dry for about 4-5 hours.

After the drying period, I cautiously powered the PC back on. At first, everything seemed fine, but then strange pixelations started appearing on the screen, so I immediately shut it down. My boyfriend pointed out that I should‚Äôve probably waited much longer before turning it back on, and now it seems that the issue is more serious than I initially thought.

I took the GPU out to clean it, but I couldn't get the case open and didn‚Äôt have any alcohol on hand to properly clean it. So, I went out, got the necessary screws and cleaning supplies, and plan to open it up tomorrow morning to give it a proper cleaning.

## Key Features Analysis

The best bass guitar ‚Äãamplifiers boast a range of‚Äå technical specifications that ‚Äãcontribute to their overall sound quality, power, and‚Å¢ versatility. From wattage and speaker configuration to tone-shaping controls and connectivity‚Äå options, understanding these features is essential to‚Å¢ selecting the right amp for your needs.

**Wattage:** wattage determines ‚Å¢the‚Å¢ amplifier's power and ‚Äåloudness capabilities. Higher wattage amplifiers (200W and above) are generally better suited for live performances in larger venues, as they‚Äã can deliver a strong, clean signal that can be heard over drums and other instruments. Lower wattage amplifiers (20W-100W) are typically‚Äå ideal for practicing at home or ‚Äårecording in smaller studio settings.

the Specific wattage of an amplifier ‚Äåwill affect its overall headroom. Higher wattage amps can‚Äç remain cleaner at louder volumes, making‚Äã them suitable for‚Å¢ heavier music styles.

**Speaker‚Å§ Configuration:** The size and‚Äç number of speakers in a bass amplifier cabinet substantially influence its tonal characteristics. ‚Å£Common configurations include 1x10"", ‚Å§1x12"", 1x15"", ‚Å£2x10"", and 4x10"". Smaller ‚Å§speakers (10"" and 12"") generally offer a tighter, more focused sound with better midrange articulation, while larger speakers (15"") tend to‚Å§ produce ‚Äça deeper, more resonant bass response. Multiple speakers can provide a fuller, more powerful ‚Å§sound with increased projection.

The selection of speaker sizes needs to consider your style of playing and typical venues.‚Å£ Smaller combos are great for practice but‚Å¢ may not have the sound projection for bigger venues.

**Tone-Shaping Controls:** bass amplifiers typically feature a ‚Å§variety‚Å£ of tone-shaping ‚Äåcontrols, such as EQ knobs (bass, mid, treble), gain, master volume, ‚Å£and sometimes more advanced features like compressors, limiters, ‚Äãand overdrive circuits. ‚Å§These controls ‚Äçallow you to sculpt the sound to your liking, adjusting‚Äå the ‚Äçfrequencies and ‚Äådynamics to achieve the desired tone. Some‚Äã amplifiers also include preset EQ settings or modeling capabilities, providing a wider range of tonal options.

Many amps‚Å¢ have a mid-range EQ sweep that gives you greater control over the all-vital mid-range frequencies relevant to‚Äå bass guitar playing.

**connectivity Options:** Modern bass amplifiers offer a range of connectivity options, including instrument input, headphone output, line output (DI), effects loop, and sometimes USB‚Å£ or Bluetooth connectivity. The instrument input connects the bass guitar to ‚Å§the amplifier. The headphone output allows for silent practice. The line‚Å£ output can be used to send the amplifier's signal directly to a mixing console or recording interface, especially‚Äç useful for live ‚Äçperformances or studio recording. The ‚Å§effects loop allows you to insert‚Å¢ external effects pedals or processors into the signal chain. USB or ‚ÄçBluetooth connectivity may enable recording directly to a computer or‚Äã streaming audio from a mobile device.

A Direct Input or DI on a bass‚Å§ amp is‚Äã especially useful‚Å¢ for larger venues and modern recording setups.

Key features of the best bass guitar amplifiers‚Äç include:

*   Powerful wattage options for various‚Äå performance settings
*   Versatile speaker configurations for diverse tonal characteristics
*   Comprehensive tone-shaping controls for precise sound sculpting
*  ‚Å¢ Flexible connectivity options for seamless integration with other equipment

## Core Benefits

Investing‚Å§ in a‚Äå quality bass guitar amplifier provides several tangible benefits for both aspiring and experienced bassists. These amplifiers not only amplify the instrument's sound but also shape its tone, enhance its dynamics, and provide connectivity options that improve overall performance and usefulness.

**Improved Tone and Sound Quality:** A high-quality bass amplifier significantly enhances the overall tone and sound quality of your bass guitar. These amplifiers are ‚Å£designed to accurately reproduce the instrument's frequencies while also providing tools for shaping the sound to your personal preferences. An amp can offer ‚Å¢a ‚Äåclean, articulate tone for mellow‚Å§ styles‚Äç or a thick,‚Äã aggressive growl for heavier music styles.

The core of a quality bass tone is defined by the relationship between the instrument and the amplifier.

**Enhanced Dynamic Control:** Good bass guitar‚Äã amplifiers improve dynamic control, allowing bassists to express a wider range of emotions and subtleties in their‚Å§ playing. Compressors and limiters, which are frequently found on high-end amplifiers, even out volume variations, ensuring that the bass lines‚Å§ remain‚Å£ consistent and clear. Gain and master volume controls allow you to‚Äç fine-tune the amp's responsiveness, thus providing a more expressive ‚Å¢playing experience.

Having a good dynamic range is very important for bass guitar ‚Å§playing.

**Increased ‚Å§versatility:** A versatile bass amplifier can be used in a wide ‚Å§range of‚Äã musical situations,making it an excellent investment for any bassist. Amplifiers that include a ‚Å£variety of tone-shaping features, connectivity ‚Äåoptions, ‚Å£and speaker configurations may be customized‚Å£ to fit different musical types and performance contexts. Some amplifiers also include modeling technologies, which let you mimic the sounds of classic amplifiers and produce a diverse array of tones.

Versatility means you can play various genres of music with the same amplifier.

**Greater ‚Å¢Convenience:** Modern bass amplifiers frequently include features that make ‚Äåperforming, practicing, and recording ‚Äãmore‚Äã convenient. Headphone outputs allow for silent practice, which‚Å£ is helpful for ‚Å¢late-night‚Å¢ sessions or situations where volume limits exist. ‚Å§Line outputs make it simple to connect to mixing consoles or recording ‚Å§interfaces, and USB or Bluetooth connectivity can be used to‚Äç record straight‚Å¢ to a computer or stream audio from a mobile device.Convenience ‚Äçfeatures are important to consider for at home practice.

##‚Äã FAQs Section

navigating the world of bass guitar amplifiers can be daunting, especially for‚Å£ beginners. Here are some frequently asked questions about bass amps, along with clear and concise answers to help you ‚Å£make informed purchasing decisions.

**What is the difference between ‚Äãa combo amp and a head and cabinet?**
A Combo amp combines an amplifier and speaker into a single unit, making it more ‚Å£portable and convenient for practice or smaller gigs. A Head and cabinet setup separates the amplifier (head) from‚Äç the speaker(s) (cabinet), offering more flexibility in terms of power and speaker configuration, which is often preferred by experienced players for ‚Å¢larger venues.

Head and cabinet amps also have a ‚Äãbigger physical presence on stage than combo amps.

**How much wattage do I need‚Äã for my bass amp?**
The amount‚Å£ of wattage you need ‚Å¢depends on the intended use of ‚Å§the‚Å£ amplifier. For practicing ‚Å¢at home, 20-50 watts might potentially be sufficient.Small gigs‚Äç in coffee shops or bars may‚Äã require 50-100 watts. Larger venues ‚Äåand outdoor performances usually necessitate 200 watts or more to ensure that the bass signal is heard‚Å£ clearly above other instruments.

Consider the typical venues you play at‚Äã as well as your budget when deciding upon wattage.

**What is‚Äç the importance ‚Å§of ‚Å§speaker size in‚Äç a‚Å§ bass amp?**
Speaker size affects the tonal‚Äç characteristics of the‚Å§ bass ‚Å§amplifier. Smaller speakers (10""‚Å¢ and 12"") typically offer a tighter, more focused sound‚Å¢ with better midrange articulation, while larger speakers (15"") tend to produce a deeper, more resonant bass response. The best choice depends‚Å¢ on your preferred playing style ‚Äãand ‚Å£the type of music you play.

Your amp speaker can be just as important as the amplifier itself.

**What are the key features‚Å§ to‚Å£ look for in a DI (direct Input) output?**
Key features to look for in a DI output include a ‚Å§ground lift switch to eliminate hum, a pre/post EQ selector to ‚Å£determine whether the DI signal is ‚Å£affected‚Äç by the amplifier's EQ settings, and a ‚Äãbalanced XLR output for optimal signal quality when‚Å§ connecting to a mixing console or recording interface.

A ground lift is an essential feature for DI outputs on ‚Äçbass guitar amplifiers.

For example one of you said that she was doing something wrong regarding her parenting style with a newborn whilst comparing herself to Macenna who always looked so well rested and fresh. Or someone said recently during the bathroom makeover that building a shower was something they could never think of doing themselves because of how intimidatingly complicated it looks. Sometimes it happens to me as well, I feel bad for renting my apartment and not having my own house with my own custom made brand new kitchen.

I just wanted to say a few things:

* Please never compare yourself to an influencer/YouTuber. What they portray is all for show, it is all fake.
* Macenna‚Äôs job is to create content. She is earning money by filming herself tiling her shower floor. I repeat: she makes money from filming herself drink a cup of coffee. The rest of us would have to renovate our bathrooms during the weekends or the evenings, and for free.
* She has a very easy job, no boss above her, works from home. Probably works 2-3 hours a day.
* Money is not something to worry about for her and will never be. Need to buy a new tool? No problem. Need to buy endless supplies and material? No problem. The project costs more than anticipated? No problem. Etc‚Ä¶
* Romeo is doing all the chores in their household.
* Romeo is taking care of the baby. When not here in Texas her mother takes care of the baby.
* Please remember that Macenna is a spoilt little girl who is just having fun with her money and is rubbing it into our faces. This is not aspirational. This is not real life.¬†
* Please never compare yourself to her, it is not worth your precious time and energy.

Honestly, I‚Äôm not going to keep track of the days. I don‚Äôt see the point in it and I‚Äôve quit many times so this is not a new thing.  

The 2nd to 4th day was the worst such horrible headaches, and fatigue.  But since then I have felt pretty great. I think it helps that I‚Äôve done this before several times. In the last couple weeks before quitting, I was only drinking about one cup of coffee and some tea per day.

So many benefits:
1. Anxiety is much reduced everything just feels a bit lighter.

2. Much more productive although I don‚Äôt have the high energy necessarily and I may feel tired at work, but I still get way more done. It seems actually it‚Äôs like I get more important things done.

3. When I wake up, I don‚Äôt feel I need anything even if I didn‚Äôt get enough sleep I may feel tired at first, but once the light hits me, I feel awake pretty soon and I feel like I can just do stuff without having to go get something you know like coffee.  

4. Sleep is not necessarily better, but I still feel more rested and taking a nap is quite easy now just a 15 minute nap and I feel refreshed.

5. I can express myself better. With coffee sometimes I wasn‚Äôt able to express myself clearly and I would stutter. My thoughts would get jumbled up, and I would have to force myself to think and speak clearly.

6. Less angry, less frustrated. With coffee, I would often get annoyed and frustrated with other people at work and even at home. This is very much reduced since quitting.  

7. More in tune with my own feelings and other people‚Äôs feelings. I feel I can relate better to others and certain relationships that were a bit rocky have markedly improved since I quit. 

I know there are more benefits, but those are the main ones I can think of at the moment . I have quit many times, but I really don‚Äôt want to go back to any caffeine, including chocolate and tea. My favorite drinks now are cold water, mint tea, chamomile tea, and the occasional beer but rarely.

When I have quit previously it was usually some significant change in my life that caused me to start back up again, like a major move or some difficulty at work or home . Or I thought I could get away with just a little green tea or similar. So I have no intention of starting back up again. But I need to stay sharp. ",5,1745155147.0,decaf,0,1.0,False
1k3mdip,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k3mdip,Journal questions,"Hi,

I have been consistently journaling for the past week and was looking through the accumulated data and I would have some questions regarding the tags.

A few days ago I didn't have any coffee and recorded so in my journal (see 1st pic attached), yet in the insights, today, it still shows that I've never not taken coffee (2nd pic). How can this be corrected?

Secondly, I wonder if the late meal tag could be updated to be automatical, especially that now it's perfectly complementary with the nutrition feature? I have set the threshold at 120minutes before bed, yet yesterday I had a fat milkshake at 11:24pm (3rd pic) and this morning the late meal tag was still checked at no (4th pic). And same question with the added sugar tag, can this be automatical?

Thank you very much, I'm loving the app so far and the active help of you devs!

I don‚Äôt have time for this.,"Chronic constipation since I was 6. Longest I‚Äôve gone was 21 days back in 2020, but i tend to average twice a week, sometimes it‚Äôll be around 10-14 days. Horrible bloating, gas, pain, nausea. I usually bloat so bad I can‚Äôt stand up straight and the pain is insane. 

I‚Äôve gone like three times in the last three weeks, and they‚Äôve been small. Usually when I go for the first time after being constipated, it‚Äôs a large amount, so i feel much better even if i only go once a week. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I went even every other day. 

Anyways, here‚Äôs my issue. I feel so sick, lots of indigestion and reflux and pain from this, BUT i have the world‚Äôs most sensitive stomach i guess. 

I‚Äôve been on Linzess, horrible horrific cramping and vasovagal syncope. Miralax made me pass out in the work bathroom and shit my pants back in 2022. All of my old ‚Äúimmediate/gentler‚Äù methods, such as coffee, fiber supplements, hot tea, heating pad, etc have stopped working. So it seems like a laxative/stool softener/enema is my only option. But, I work full time. 

Not only do i not want to have horrific, constant diarrhea at work (bathroom is also in my shared office, so no thanks), but even the gentle options cause me such severe cramping  i pass out or feel like I‚Äôm going to throw up. I literally just don‚Äôt have the time to take any of these things. If it was immediate, I‚Äôd take it on a weekend or something and just pass out and scream in pain from the cramping and shit water all day in the privacy of my own home, but it‚Äôs so unpredictable. 

How do you guys plan your poops? I feel like a lot of people take something every day, but with how my body reacts to even osmotic softeners, i can‚Äôt really afford to be fainting every day. I‚Äôm looking into fleet enemas but it seems that it does cause cramping for some people, and im sure I‚Äôll also be one of those. Everything is just so violent for me.

Until then ... welcome to :

# OODENYARK

*Come one, come all*   
*to our barrow thrice wheeled,*   
*to a tiny spectacular sight!*   
  
*Where fleas flit, hop,*   
*and tumble-tip*   
*'neath yonder starless night*   
  
*A marvel to thy widening eye,*   
*with magnificence & might*   
*these legends, minute,*   
*Shall fling and flip,*   
*Their audiences delight*   
  
*For all shall sing their ode of wonder,*   
*A summoning, as of the lark*   
*Encircling many splendored spectacles,*   
*from this Circus of* ***Oodenyark****.*





# WHAT IS OODENYARK?

A travelling flea-circus, housed upon a rickety old market trader's barrow pulled hither and thither by a blind old ram.   
  
Oodenyark, and its steed, is attended to by a silent custodian shrouded entirely in a heap of mouldering great-cloaks, crowned by a battered bowler hat resplendent with old feathers.   
  
Unbeknownst to most, the fleas are the souls of long ago and barely remembered heroes, their adventuring abruptly ended by the acquisition *(re: usually theft)* of some ancient, and accursed, artefact.   
  
Oodenyark now wheels about the many lands, pitched here and there upon mud-caked market squares and promenades until its old tin donation bucket brims with coin, whereupon the open road beckons once again.





# SIGHTS, SOUNDS, & SMELLS

*Use this section as a quick reference during play, or at the start of a Session to refresh your GM senses!*  
  
**Sights**  


* a large market-trader's barrow fashioned from weather worn timbers, and half covered in dirtied canvas cloth
* hand painted, ageing signs that depict the flea circus and its minuscule performers
* two enormous cart wheels whose spokes have been many times replaced with ill-fitting, ill-sized timbers
* a single oil lamp aflame with a flickering dull green, shedding acrid smoke as it burns
* a stained canvas covering a large, ornate bird cage housing the many fleas of Oodenyark
* various banners and flags unfurled when a performance is near 

  
  
**Sounds**  


* woefully out of tune, hand-cranked miniature calliope secured to the belly of the barrow
* creaking of barrow timbers and wheel mounts greatly in need of greasingcrackle of a cursed oil lamp
* wheezing of the flea-master
* low growl-like bleating of the old blind sheep
* clanking and rattling of old pots and pans strung beneath the cart  

  
  
**Smells** 

* sour oil
* unwashed cloth and old sweat
* home-brewed gin
* sheep dung and mouldering wool
* garlic and peppermint
* liquorice and black treacle





# LOCAL ECONOMY

Oodenyark relies upon a gathered crowd; one easily swayed to its attentions.   
  
It holds no scruples as to where, and how, such an audience is assembled. Festivals are much the same as a riot; a hanging as good as a feast; for wherever there is a multitude of curious folk, there is much and many a coin.   
  
Once Oodenyark's barrow comes to a halt, its alluring appendages and banners unfurled, its calliope and torches engaged, and its souvenir stand set-out, the fleas are fast able to draw - and hold - a quickly enraptured audience.   
  
Thereafter, a performance precisely choreographed and wound tighter than an horologist's gaze amply distracts, whilst many a pocket and purse may be lightened by unseen hands sent forth by the flea-keeper.





# IMPORTS

Primarily, an audience; small or large, rich or poor, dismissive or enchanted, silent or unruly; it matters not.   
  
There are - though rare - the occasional arrival of new fleas; souls freshly plucked from a hero recently succumbed to some detestable curse or another, or else having underestimated the veracity of an artefact-identifier's careful warning.





# EXPORTS

Aside from the onlooker departing the miniature spectacle with a pocket lighter than the morning mist, it is chiefly tales of the fleas and their performances that travel beyond Oodenyark.   
  
Such an attraction is uncommon, carrying with it a wistful air of times long past, and places somehow lost. As such, many are those who elbow and jostle for a place before the barrow, eager for a tale to tell thereafter, and a memory of it rarer than the flowering of a midnight bloom.





# LODGINGS & SHELTER

Beneath the rickety old barrow upon which the flea-circus is housed, a curtain of old sack-cloth hangs like a mud-sodden skirt.   
  
Pull back this mess of sacking, and one should find there a place of rest and respite approximating the appearance and dimensions of a forest clearing at midnight, replete with campfire, nightingale song, and a sky full of stars ringed by a halo of green boughs.   
  
Ample space may be found to recuperate here, with simple bedrolls and hammocks for sleeping surrounding a fire over which spit plump meats and roasted vegetables.   
  
Though naught approximating extravagance, in furnishings or revitalising fare, it remains comfortable at all times, and a most welcome retreat for **Kin√ºrt** when the flea-circus travels between towns and cities.   
  
Step not into the surrounding foliage, however - for it is there that, in the jagged shadows and damp places, the demon **Scallion** squats and feasts.





# HIERARCHY & POLITICAL STRUCTURE

An initial appraisal might suggest **Kin√ºrt**, the bowler-hatted, rag-covered swaying mass, to be the proprietor of Oodenyark.   
  
Its true master, however, is **Scallion** \- a wretched, one-horned, milky-eyed Ram tethered by a piece of old string to the weather worn barrow.   
  
**Scallion**; a demon of the old worlds, its legends long discarded, its true form forgotten, it amasses now an imprisoned hoard of noble souls with which it might soon barter its way back upon the firmament of eternal deities once more.   
  
And it those same souls who linger now, imprisoned within the fleas, their necks bound with copper, and set about the bidding of their eternal host as the barrow creaks and jittery-wheels about the many lands.





# CULTURE

Prison, performance, or purgatory?   
  
For all the shabby nostalgia of its exterior, there is much obscured therein for the sharp-eyed onlooker who might ponder upon those fleas within, ill-knowing them mere husks for such brave souls severed and implanted; set thereafter to dance and to hoist, to leap and entrance.   
  
Such miseries matter not, for with fading gold-leaf, peeled paint, and mildewing velours, the lanterns thus lit and the calliope spun, the show must ever go on!





# SOME ADVENTURE HOOK IDEAS

*This list is by no means exhaustive, and is intended simply to stir the pot of your own imagination.*

*Use what follows as starting-points, or ignore them entirely in favour of your own Adventure Hooks!*

**Roll 1d8 for an Oodenyark Adventure, or choose from the Table below :** 

**1 -** A Party Member unknowingly finds themselves hosting one of Oodenyark's fleas. An escapee??   
  
**2 -** The Party happen upon the wheelbarrow flea circus, its blind old ram stuck firmly in a sodden clay road.   
  
**3 -** The Party each have their pockets thoroughly picked by the Unseen Hands of Oodenyark.  
  
**4 -** The fleas of the circus have been infected with an unusual arcana, causing them to swell immeasurably in size.   
  
**5 -** Kin√ºrt somehow manages to pass a scrawled note to a Party Member in the encircled audience. The message pleads for aid, and proclaims a great treasure to be had as reward.   
  
**6 -** A mage has offered to fashion for the Party several powerful aids to their various arcanas. In exchange, they ask for a portal incantation to be delivered to the forest clearing's campfire hidden somewhere beneath Oddenyark's barrow.   
  
**7 -** A family begs the Party to seek out their runaway child, said now to travel with a roaming Oodenyark.   
  
**8 -** The Party are tasked by a noble to escort them to the circus; a ruse to enact powerful magics to shrink the Party Members and deposit them aboard Oodenyark.

**Roll 1d20 for an Oodenyark Trinket or choose from the Table below :**

**1 -** 60cm of unbreakable fine, copper wire.

**8 -** A delicate silver rod, a different key cut at both ends.

# RANDOM ENCOUNTER ROLL-TABLE

**1 -** a rabble of orphans and urchins close in on the Cart, mid-performance, their hidden blades eager to slash and strike. 

**2 -** a retinue of Guardsfolk attempt to move the assembled crowd along; chaos welcomed by Oodenyark's unseen hands. 

**3 -** a small child, not yet out of wrappings, has somehow managed to clamber upon the back of Scallion, the old blind ram. 

**4 -** a colossal, battle-hardened warrior announces their presence from the crowd - ""Varan, of the Elshem, demands trial by combat with the one here called Alto!""

**5 -** an enormous flock of starlings circles for a while above, before beginning its many attacks upon Oodenyark. 

**6 -** a passing farmer, with a nearby flock of docile sheep, has stopped to insist that Scallion belongs to them. 

**7 -** someone in the crowded audience spills a tankard of cheap ale, and begins to shriek about a ""hand trying to tear away my pocket purse!!"" 

**8 -** Several lightning strikes, in quick succession, hit the barrow of Oodenyark, its shattered remains now mere rubble beneath the feet of four Heroes released from its accursed hold.





# INFESTATIONS OF FLEAS

As GM, you might also wish to assume that Oodenyark is riddled with arcane-touched Fleas.   
  
Some of the insects might - should any Party member come too close to the old barrow - transport themselves upon their person(s).   
  
These visitors might thereafter afford any afflicted Party member certain boons. You may wish to offer, or customise, the table below.   
  
*Roll 1d4 for number of fleas upon a person, and the boons that they then bring* *:*

**1 Flea -** once per day, you become invisible for 1d100 minutes. During this time, inter-planar moths eat any fabric or cloth in which you are attired.   
  
**2 Fleas** \- once per day, for one hour, your hearing improves by 1000%. During this time, you are also rendered unable to talk.  
  
**3 Fleas -** for 1d6 hours per day, when in shadow, you become as shadow. If this occurs for 3 days in a row, this shadow inhabiting becomes permanent.   
  
**4 Fleas -** for 1 hour each day, your strength and stamina appears near limitless. You sleep for one hour less per each day of this infestation's lasting.





# SOUVENIRS OF OODENYARK

The flea-circus barrow offers for purchase a pleasing array of mementos, tokens, & souvenirs. 

*For a few examples of such fare, Roll 1d8 or choose from the Table below* 

**1 -** a porcelain thimble decorated with a single flea. 

**2 -** a small cloth badge embroidered with the words ""*Hopping Mad for Oodenyark!*"" upon it.

**3 -** various postcard portraits of the many acts & entertainments of Oodenyark.

**4 -** a pair of novelty eye-glasses enabling the user to ""*see now large what was once far too small*"".

**5 -** variously flavoured barley-sugar lollypops shaped in the manner of a flea.

**6 -** novelty flea-powder, sold in small wooden salt-shaker-like containers upon which is written a warning to *""unleash the itch within with care!""* 

**7 -** decorative dishcloths decorated with the coat-of-arms of Oodenyark. 

**8 -** a tin whistle that, when blown, emits various phrases and calls from the ""Heroes of Oodenyark"".





# RESIDENTS OF NOTE

*ancestries have not been allocated, allowing the GM to assign as appropriate*



**SCALLION**

A surly, blind old Ram, bound to the barrow with faded ribbons and rope, a shin-bone bit tethered between its blackened teeth; with shabby woollen cheeks blushed by blood-red rosettes it drags the circus, over and across all lands in search of heroic souls to imprison within its fleas.   
Scallion was once a demon deity, lord of all shadows and thorns, and in thirsting for broader dominion was struck from the palaces of the eternals, so great and ignoble were their infractions against the many gods.   
Scallion is fed now by a longing to return, seeking to barter its way back to godhood with the sublime and arcane sacrifice of souls.

  




**KIN√úRT**

7ft tall, and half fashioned from rusted boot-nails, they attend to the wheelbarrow silently, shrouded by so much discarded and filth-caked cloth topped of with a feather speckled bowler. No face can be discerned, and their hands are obscured within gloves.  
They were a whaler, once, before losing a bet to a mage, and it is Kin√ºrt's finely wrought shanties - so artfully whistled - that tellers first mention when conveying their tales of Oodenyark's wheelbarrow Circus.



  


**LOTTE**

A scruffy young orphan who has somehow succeeded adopting the barrow of Oodenyark as its ward. As to their story? Who could say, for to parse such a thing from Lotte would take much insight and skill, as neither word nor sound escape their cracked, dry lips.   
One other stows away alongside Lotte, too - **Roopalvaparn**; Lotte‚Äôs pugnacious (and ever so tiny) bumblebee.

  




**THE DASHING BLADE; A FLEA**

Flechen Eassenfrenk, proud noble of the North, keen wielder of swords, falconer, scholar, adventurer, poet. How such a bright star came to be so besmirched is a tale too aeonic for this tome's telling.   
Suffice to say, Eassenfrenk's woes arose from the treacherous jealousies of others, and he retains all honour; a grace not even the indignities of fleadom could devour.

  




**THE CONUNDRUM; A FLEA**

Even for this escapologist of legendary renown, Oodenyark was to prove one too many levels down a most illusory rabbit hole.   
Each tiny lock and chain they now break in their performances as a flea sends them spiralling ever deeper within mazes of madness and despair as they toil, secretly, to craft the ""Key of all Turnings"".





  
**ALTO, THE MAGNIFICENT; A FLEA**

A brute of epic proportions and capability, Alto had been travelling to a grand tournament when their attentions were pulled awry by Oodenyark.   
Wishing only to rest some while and to enjoy the entertainments, their physical prowess caught the nose of Scallion, and the magic was quickly wrought to bring the unsuspecting Alto into servitude.   
Greatly missed by their friends and family, and endearingly framed in the memories of many more, Alto yearns to be freed.

  




**TESSALAMAST, THE HUNTER; A FLEA**

A host of indignities spare naught to the one who set forth in search of Oodenyark - wishing to destroy it - only to be enraptured by, and bound within, its arcane charms upon locating it.Tessalamast, once a fine hunter, is forced now to perform a mock-battle against a host of bugs and beetles, the pincers and jaws of which no nothing of the ""act"". 



  


**THE FLEA KING; A FLEA**

At the finale of every performance, one among the fleas is chosen to make laps of the tiny stage upon a bejewelled chariot of shimmering gold, much to the delight of many in the assembled audience.  
That he is thereafter devoured - night after night, performance after performance - only increases the joyous fury and rapturous indignation of the audience.   
T‚Äôis naught but a mockery of old kingdoms, however, for the soul entrapped therein was once lauded as the noble heir to a great and powerful throne; a land long in mourning for the mysterious disappearance of their beloved monarch.

1k3maet,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k3maet/love_mixed_signals_my_rollercoaster_relationship/,"Love & Mixed Signals: My Rollercoaster Relationship From Hell, am i an asshole?","Oh man, I'm going to try to tell this story properly because it was one of the most confusing things I've ever experienced. I met my ex and, from the beginning, she had certain behaviors that really bothered me. Like, we would arrange to have a video call, and she would always make an excuse: ""Oh, my hair is a mess"", ""I look ugly today"", and in the end she would never show up.After a while, she told me she had autism. Okay, I understood, but then things got even weirder. She was super quiet, the conversations seemed like a monologue‚Äîjust her talking about her cats, her nephews, or her problems with her exes. She would say that her last boyfriend had left her, that another guy had left her for another woman, and I would just listen, trying to be understanding.

There was one time when I was mugged and I almost lost her number. At the time, I was in a bad mood, and she? No worries. She sent me an ""If you don't text me, I won't text you either"". WTF, right?



Then came the hangouts. She complained that we never went out, but when I asked her to something, it was a festival of excuses:The movies? ""Oh, no, I'm embarrassed.""I insisted, she agreed, but the next day: ""It's better if we just be friends, right?""In the end, we went anyway. We kissed at the movies, we started dating, but she wouldn't even let me touch her phone. Instagram? She only gave me hers AFTER we broke up. One day we went to the mall, nothing, we ended up going somewhere else. But there, she acted strange, I was fine, but she quickly changed her mood, she became strange, and then I had that feeling of ""what the hell is going on?"".Another time, we went to a square, we made out as a couple, and when I went to take her home, she made it clear that she didn't want me to meet her family. I was suspicious, but I let it go and went to meet her parents.And the outbursts? One time her sister came to drop her off at my house, and I blurted out: ""We're not going out because you're a pain in the ass."" She freaked out, she got mad. Another time, we were playing, I criticized the game, and she hung up right away.The climax was when she invited me to a party, and we kept going back and forth:""Oh, I'm not going anymore.""""Oh, I will.""I asked if she didn't want me to go, but she stalled.I asked to get there early, and she said ""Only at 6pm."" I got there early, her sister saw me and asked me to come up. I brought chocolates and apologized (she had said I'd hurt her).



At the party, she introduced me as her boyfriend, but OUT OF NOWHERE she blurted out: ""Shall we download an app to find you a hottie?"" What's up, man? Then she even wanted me to sleep at her house, but I bailed. The last episode before I broke up was when she came to my house and gave me two chocolates. We were fine, and then she said, ""Wouldn't it be better if we broke up?""In the end, I got tired and broke up. She cried, blocked me, and then said that I ""had sent her to CAPS"" and ""ruined her happiness."" But a few days later she came back with, ""I miss you more than I thought.""



We started talking again, but then I found her on a dating app. She said she ""was looking for a friend's ex."" Seriously? LOL.I told her I loved her, and she invited me to a random party, then to her mother's party. I didn't go. Her mother CALLED ME asking ""if I loved her."" Her mother later invited me to have coffee there. My ex texted me saying she missed me more than I thought she would and said she was in a beautiful place and wanted me to be there.

Then we started talking again, she said her father was mad at me, I posted a rant online, she saw it and said: ""You used me, I'm just insecure and autistic, I prayed for you every day""‚Äîand blocked me for good.Conclusion? I don't know if it was autism, if it was a game, or just immaturity.Has anyone ever been through something like this?",2,1745154864.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I have been working so hard to lose weight, I have had some health issues lately, as well as being overweight. I started off by changing my diet and exercising everyday, as well as being on phentermine, recommended by my doctor. Ive cut out bread, red meats (for the most part), and alcohol. Ive started eating fruits and vegetables everyday, usually in the form of a breakfast smoothie, and mainly salads at dinner with a form of protein, usually fish and chicken. I've been watching my calorie intake and trying to burn off as much as I can while exercising. My breakfast smoothies contain fruit (always a banana base, I get cramps, and berries), and a vegetable (something good for my liver, I have had a crappy liver from the get go) that I add to it. I don't even drink because of my liver.

I've been watching my calories like a hawk, taking the time to determine how much is in each smoothie, salad, meal, drink, and snack. I've been trying to maintain a deficit of 500-600 calories, sometimes less if I can get to it. If I have a day where I eat a larger meal, then I work out to try to adjust for that.

It started off great, I lost 23 pounds in about 2 months. I'm 33 and 6'6"", I started at 310, and once I hit 287 I just seem to be stuck there. Two weeks ago I began fasting every other day (with a full 24 hours between meals), and changed my exercise from 30 minutes a day to an hour. I've been focusing mainly on weight lifting trying to get my muscles around my crappy knees built up, with cardio mixed in, and a full session of cardio every other day. My blood work has improved immensely, I went from pre-diabetic to great numbers, my cholesterol is in great range, and my blood pressure is in a good range. I had to stop my blood pressure medication because it's fine without it and if I take it I get severely light headed.

I just looked at myself on the scale, again, and I'm at 286.6, still. I've been hovering around 286-289 for almost a month. What am I doing wrong? There's no way I can be eating that many calories a day, I'm drinking the same amount of water I have been the whole time, when I fast that's all I drink, with a couple cups of black coffee in the morning. I'm trying so hard, and made so many changes to my lifestyle. I'm getting depressed and disheartened with no results for all my efforts. What do I need to do from here?

1k3m2yl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1k3m2yl/why_should_you_choose_the_baby_trend_jogger/,Why Should You Choose the Baby Trend Jogger Stroller Review for Active Parents?,"The Baby Trend B0CC411QTM Range Jogger Stroller and EZ Flec Loc 32 Infant Car Seat Base had me genuinely intrigued after reading about its standout features. As someone who‚Äôs dealt with a fair share of strollers for both my kids and my niece, I approached this product with practical curiosity. The product features a sleek alloy steel frame finished in black, promising durability and modern aesthetics. With a combination of functionality and thoughtful details aimed at families on-the-go, I was eager to see if it lived up to its reputation.

**Design and Build Quality**

This stroller is visually impressive with a modern design that doesn‚Äôt feel over-the-top. The alloy steel frame feels sturdy, and I could tell it‚Äôs made to endure. The lockable front swivel wheel is a game-changer, providing smooth maneuverability whether navigating crowded spaces or simply taking a walk in the park. I also appreciated the extra-wide ergonomic handle, which makes folding this stroller relatively effortless for one-handed use‚Äîsomething every busy parent can value.

**Ease of Use and Convenience**

What really stands out is how user-friendly this product is, from the parent tray that includes two cup holders and a covered compartment to the adjustable canopy with a covered sunroof. These little additions make outings far more manageable. My own daily test involved trips to various locations, and having a place for my coffee cup or keys (without losing them!) was honestly a lifesaver. It also sports footrest reflectors for better visibility during evening walks, a safety feature I never knew I needed until now.

[Don‚Äôt miss Baby Trend B0CC411QTM deals‚Äîcheck Amazon here.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b0cc411qtm/)

**Child Comfort and Safety**

Safety is always a top concern, and I‚Äôm impressed by the 5-point harness that equips the stroller. The reclining seat holds its appeal as it offers one simple position, meaning no over-complicated adjustments, yet it keeps the baby cozy. During rides, my niece seemed genuinely comfortable‚Äîno wiggling or irritability, which says a lot‚Äîespecially when she had her little toy securely attached to the belly bar. Still, while the sunshade was decent, I felt it could‚Äôve been a smidge larger for those extra sunny days.

**Performance Worth Mentioning**

The composite all-terrain tires set this stroller apart. Whether we were on bumpy sidewalks, grass, or gravel, the ride was noticeably less shaky compared to many strollers I‚Äôve tested in the past. Pair that with the swivel wheel's lockable functionality; this product seems tailor-made for parents who like running errands or simply jogging with their child. Unfortunately, the weight capacity maxes out at 50 lbs, which might limit usage as your child grows.

**Strengths**

- Simple fold design with one hand.
- Reflective strips for low-light safety.
- Compact size, great for storage or car trunks.
- Can accommodate a travel system when paired with the infant car seat.

**Critiques**

- The weight limit of 50 lbs might not suffice for larger toddlers.
- Limited recline options, which some parents might find restrictive.
- Sunshade coverage could be improved.
  
**Competitive Options**

Comparing the Baby Trend Range Jogger to industry favorites like the BOB Gear Revolution Flex 3.0 Stroller, there certainly are trade-offs. While the BOB offers a higher-end suspension system and can accommodate a slightly higher weight, it comes with a steeper price tag. Similarly, strollers from Graco tend to provide adjustable reclining seats, but they often lack a well-thought-out ergonomic handle like the Baby Trend Range Jogger.

The Baby Trend excels in compactness and affordability for what it delivers. However, it might feel basic to parents who prioritize lavish extras. For daily city strolling or light jogs, this jogger has proven its worth during my test drives.

**Price Worthiness**

Judging based on quality-to-price ratio, I‚Äôd say this stroller feels fairly reasonable. You‚Äôre not dropping hundreds for unnecessary frills; instead, the focus lies on practical use and safety, making it especially appealing for parents on a budget without wanting to compromise entirely on features. Still, some higher-ticket competitors might offer additional perks that justify their pricing based on individual needs.

I wanted to put down my impressions and advice. I combed over posts in this sub for 6 months, trying to make sure I got everything I could out of this cruise, and thank you to all for that info. It helped! Here are the things I wish I‚Äôd know before cruising:

1. You are absolutely beautiful and young enough to be on this boat. There were people of every age and hotness on this ship. The rumors would suggest that the Scarlet Lady is a constant orgy of hot 20-young 30-somethings; I think average age was mid-fifties. And we saw one upside down pineapple. It was (almost disappointingly) super-normal.
2. It is surprisingly great not to have to dress up for restaurants. 
3. You do not need a suite to have a good time- no fomo needed. If the upgrade bid would take a significant amount of your savings, skip it. I didn‚Äôt see many Rock Stars flaunting it. Honestly, it only seemed to matter with one show where 2 couples cut a long line to see a magician. I still got in to see the show after showing ip only 20m in advance. 
4. The beds are fine. Not great, but not as hard as I was scared they‚Äôd be. I asked about the mattress topper, and my stateroom attendant said they hear that so often that they‚Äôve started putting a thin mattress topper (it was like 2 duvets) on in advance. I like a soft bed and I slept fine.
5. The hammocks on a sea terrace are amaaaaazing. 
6. The best part of the cruise for me was the fitness facilities. I know, who goes on a cruise to work out? But when you‚Äôre taking a run on a modern tread and staring out at the sea, or playing with a bungee, or doing yoga as the sun rises‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just worth taking some time in the gym each morning. 
7. Food is very subjective. I know that this forum prefers Extra Virgin as the best restaurant‚Ä¶I completely disagree and further say I loved Test Kitchen best. Try everything. 
8. If you won‚Äôt try everything, my faves were: Gunbae‚Äôs crispy chicken, the Wake brunch cronut (Virgin‚Äôs pastry game is elite), Galley strawberry danish and Scarlet Lady pastry, Lucky Lotus duck bao and blossoming fish, everything the Dock serves during Opa hour, the Wake bread and lamb chop.
9. Disembarkation at the end of the cruise was a crowded nightmare due to elevators and an early call to leave the ship. Try to leave the ship between 8-9 if you want to leave in the sweet spot. After 9:15, Virgin may call for everyone to leave and it becomes a mess. 
10. Set your expectations: The Galley IS a buffet. Yes, there are people actively cooking food. But when I asked for my western omelet, the guy pulled out the tongs and got me a lukewarm omelet from a (poorly) heated storage drawer below the counter. It‚Äôs a buffet with people standing there to distribute the food in a more sanitized way, I guess? Breakfast in the Galley is disappointing if you‚Äôre looking for hot things. There are a few stations that will actively cook your stuff (the sandwich place in the back). Seek those places out. For cold breakfast, the Galley is great. And other meals at the Galley are much hotter.
11. Ceilings are low, but not low enough to mess with you, according to my 6‚Äô2‚Äù hubby. If you‚Äôre above 6‚Äô3‚Äù, I‚Äôd consider a different boat.
12. The pool‚Ä¶sucks. There is one pool, and only half that pool is deeper than 8 inches. There is a wellness pool (think 78 degrees or so) with bubbles and benches like a hot tub. There are hot tubs that don‚Äôt bubble and are on the low end of hot. Also, they are the dirtiest hot tubs I have ever seen - hair and a lot of detritus just floating in one in the early afternoon on a port day.
13. Conversely, the rain shower was great! Much better than expected.
14. The coffee was inconsistent. I would say it was usually acceptable coffee. The coffee for purchase was better. If you‚Äôre a coffee fan, plan to grab some from the Grounds Club.
15. Myth: ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt nickel and dime you.‚Äù OF COURSE they nickel and dime you- they‚Äôre a business and would like your money. (There is nothing wrong with this.) They don‚Äôt take money for fitness classes or the specialty restaurants but the moment you get in your stateroom, you‚Äôre greeted by a plastic octopus that costs $12 to take home. You want mashed potatoes? On this boat, they‚Äôre only available with a $45 Tomahawk chop. Someone I met got ‚Äúgiven‚Äù a ‚Äútake home gift‚Äù after a massage and didn‚Äôt find the $100+ charge until the last day of the cruise. The majority of the nickel and dime is in drinks. I‚Äôm a light drinker, and just in a few alcoholic drinks, 2 non-proof pairings ($60 for 2, worth it), and coffees, it was easy for my hubby and I to rack up $240 in our folio. I did not enjoy their low-end alcohol choices or I would have spent more. The virgin peach daiquiri I got near the Sun Club was literally made with weak peach syrup from a spray bottle, lime juice and water. If that‚Äôs the quality of what you‚Äôre selling, $9 seems a bit much. The one drink I would recommend if you are a sweet drinker is ‚ÄúFlower‚Äù for $13 at the Test Kitchen. Creative & tasty. Just be aware - your cruise fare has a lot of the typical charges built in, but not all. If you‚Äôre wondering if something has a fee, ask.
16. The Social Club has a lot of great board games - not just chess and scrabble, but Azul, Splendor, Ticket to Ride. Very cool. I liked some of the Trivia, too. The hot dogs and fun food they serve is good too. It gets crowded! It‚Äôs a great place to make friends.
17. The arcade, as much as I love the concept, needs love. About half the games have controller issues - a joystick that doesn‚Äôt work, a button that sticks, a game that won‚Äôt even start, etc. 
18. Shows were good but need bigger venues or a reservation system for the ones in the Manor. Manor was always standing room only. Red Room was never super-packed. Duel Reality is a necessity. LOLZ Supper Club was not an option this week on Scarlet Lady.
19. Scarlet Night is very cool. Bring red to wear, crazier the better.
20. I was glad I grabbed a prem internet package ($150) (nickel & diming!)before boarding. It gave me 2 devices for the price of 1, and hubby and I were able to cycle active devices. 
21. Disembarking and embarking at ports was super fast and easy.

This will probably be my last Virgin cruise. I found so many little things turned into stress - like, ‚ÄúGotta be up at midnight to book the restaurants! Gotta get on board asap or I‚Äôll never get the bungee fitness!‚Äù (Both True and not true - bungee fitness books up fast, but people will cancel as the trip goes on and you can grab the reservation times.) and the pool situation is a real game-changer. But I‚Äôm glad I tried Virgin. I think Virgin is trying to offer an ‚ÄúAnti-Cruise Cruise‚Äù, and that it has some great ideas that need better execution.

---

Imagine a kid, fresh off scoring a dazzling 96% in 10th, eyes sparkling with ambition, heart set on conquering JEE. That was me. I dove into the dream, joining a small local coaching with just 30 of us, a tight-knit batch buzzing with hope. Every Sunday, we‚Äôd face a test, and every Sunday, I‚Äôd emerge on top‚Äîfirst rank, again and again. It felt like I was unstoppable, like the universe was cheering me on. But pride can be a tricky thing. In 12th, I thought I‚Äôd cracked the code. ‚ÄúWhy stick to coaching?‚Äù I told myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll study online, carve my own path.‚Äù YouTube became my classroom, but somewhere along the way, it also became my distraction. Procrastination crept in like a thief, stealing hours, then days. I‚Äôd scroll, I‚Äôd stall, I‚Äôd promise myself, ‚ÄúTomorrow, I‚Äôll start.‚Äù But tomorrow never came.

January‚Äôs JEE attempt hit like a wake-up call‚Äî75 percentile. My boards weren‚Äôt much kinder, scraping by at 82%. I knew April‚Äôs attempt was a lost cause; I wasn‚Äôt ready, so I didn‚Äôt show up. But the dream? It still burned. My family and I decided I‚Äôd take a drop year, a chance to redeem myself. We chose the Prayas batch, a fresh start. And oh, how I started! From dawn to midnight, I poured in 13 to 16 hours a day, fueled by coffee and conviction. Physics, Chemistry, Math‚Äîthey weren‚Äôt just subjects; they were my battlefield. Until October, I was a warrior.

But battles aren‚Äôt won on early victories. November came, and something shifted. The fire dimmed. Distractions returned‚Äîphone notifications, random thoughts, excuses. November, December, January‚ÄîI barely touched my books. I was sleepwalking through my drop year, betraying the kid who‚Äôd once topped every test. January‚Äôs attempt? A predictable 85 percentile. It stung, but not as much as the realization that I‚Äôd let myself down.

Then came the final blow. Instead of revising what I‚Äôd already learned, instead of sharpening my strengths through tests, I chased my backlog like it was the holy grail. I thought completing every chapter would save me. But knowledge isn‚Äôt a checklist; it‚Äôs a living thing. By April, I‚Äôd ‚Äúfinished‚Äù the syllabus but forgotten it all. The result? 84 percentile. A number that felt like a mirror, reflecting every mistake, every lost hour.

And yet, here I am, standing at the edge of a second drop year. Not because I‚Äôm chasing a rank or a college, but because I‚Äôm chasing the version of myself that refuses to give up. This time, it‚Äôs not about percentiles or perfection. It‚Äôs about giving my 100%, no matter what the scoreboard says. I‚Äôve tasted failure, felt its weight, but I‚Äôve also glimpsed my own strength. I know what it‚Äôs like to lose focus, to let dreams slip through careless fingers. But I also know what it‚Äôs like to fight back.

To every aspirant reading this, let my story be your reminder: this journey isn‚Äôt just about JEE. It‚Äôs about who you become along the way. You‚Äôll stumble. You‚Äôll doubt. You might even cry into your notes at 2 a.m. But every hour you fight for, every distraction you push away, every concept you wrestle into clarity‚Äîthat‚Äôs you building a heart that won‚Äôt break. Don‚Äôt let procrastination steal your tomorrows. Don‚Äôt let backlogs blind you to what you already know. Revise, test, repeat. And above all, believe. Because even if the rank slips away, the courage you forge in this fire? That‚Äôs yours forever.

I‚Äôm stepping into this second drop with no regrets, only resolve. My 100%, my all, no matter the end.

1k3lsx3,https://v.redd.it/jpk52smokzve1,How do you balance being ambitious with appreciating the present?,"Ambition is a double-edged sword. On one side, it drives success, fuels innovation, and pushes you to grow. But on the other side, it can trap you in an endless cycle of chasing ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next‚Äù‚Äîmaking it impossible to enjoy where you are right now.

So how do you balance striving for more while fully experiencing the present? How do you stay hungry for progress without feeling like happiness is always just one more goal away?

Here‚Äôs how to master the art of being ambitious while staying grounded in the present moment.

  

1. Redefine Success: Make It About Progress, Not Just Outcomes
üöÄ Why It Works:
Most ambitious people attach happiness to a future milestone:
‚úÖ ‚ÄúI‚Äôll feel successful when I hit six figures.‚Äù
‚úÖ ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be happy when I get that promotion.‚Äù
‚úÖ ‚ÄúI‚Äôll relax when I finally achieve X.‚Äù

üìå The Problem? Every time you reach a goal, a new one appears. This keeps happiness always in the future, never in the now.

üí° Better Approach: Shift your focus to progress, not just results.

‚úÖ Instead of: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be happy when I reach my goal.‚Äù
üéØ Try: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of the progress I‚Äôm making right now.‚Äù

üîë Takeaway: Happiness isn‚Äôt at the finish line‚Äîit‚Äôs in the growth you experience along the way.

  

2. Use the ‚ÄúArrival Fallacy‚Äù to Your Advantage
üöÄ What It Is:
The Arrival Fallacy (coined by psychologist Tal Ben-Shahar) is the false belief that once you achieve a goal, you‚Äôll finally feel happy and fulfilled.

üìå The Reality? After the excitement wears off, you‚Äôre left thinking: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù‚Äîleading to a never-ending cycle of chasing future happiness.

üí° How to Fix It:
‚úÖ Enjoy the Journey: Actively appreciate the process, not just the end result.
‚úÖ Set Meaningful, Not Just Metric-Based Goals: Don‚Äôt just chase numbers‚Äîpursue things that truly matter.
‚úÖ Celebrate Small Wins: If you only celebrate bigachievements, you‚Äôll always feel behind.

üîë Takeaway: There‚Äôs no ‚Äúfinal destination‚Äù where happiness kicks in‚Äîso learn to enjoy the ride.

  

3. Practice Gratitude to Ground Yourself in the Present
üöÄ Why It Works:
Ambition makes you focus on what you want next. Gratitude reminds you of what you already have. When balanced, they create contentment without complacency.

üìå How to Apply It:
‚úÖ Start Your Day with 3 Gratitudes: Before diving into goals, list three things you‚Äôre grateful for.
‚úÖ Shift from ‚ÄúLack‚Äù to ‚ÄúAbundance‚Äù Thinking: Instead of ‚ÄúI need more,‚Äù try ‚ÄúLook at what I‚Äôve already achieved.‚Äù
‚úÖ Gratitude Before Goal-Setting: Before planning your next steps, take a moment to appreciate how far you‚Äôve come.

üí° Example: Olympic athletes who practice gratitude report higher levels of motivation and fulfillment‚Äîbecause they‚Äôre driven without feeling constantly unsatisfied.

üîë Takeaway: Ambition says, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù‚ÄîGratitude says, ‚ÄúLook how far I‚Äôve come.‚Äù You need both.

  
4. Schedule ‚ÄúPresence Breaks‚Äù (Because Your Brain Needs a Reset)
üöÄ Why It Works:
High achievers tend to be mentally stuck in the future‚Äîplanning, strategizing, and thinking ahead. This is great for success, but terrible for inner peace.

üìå How to Stay Present While Staying Ambitious:
‚úÖ Mindful Mornings: Avoid checking your phone first thing. Start with 5 minutes of deep breathing or journaling.
‚úÖ ‚ÄúDo Nothing‚Äù Breaks: Take 10 minutes a day to sit without distractions‚Äîno phone, no to-do list, just being present.
‚úÖ End-of-Day Reflection: Before bed, list one moment you truly enjoyed that day.

üí° Example: Steve Jobs took daily ‚Äúwalking meetings‚Äù to disconnect from stress, boost creativity, and stay mindful.

üîë Takeaway: Success happens in the future‚Äîbut life happens right now. Make time for both.

  

5. Set Goals with Flexible Timelines (To Reduce Anxiety)
üöÄ Why It Works:
Ambition can create self-imposed pressure‚Äîthe feeling that you must succeed by a certain age, year, or milestone.

üìå How to Stay Driven Without Feeling Behind:
‚úÖ Use the ‚ÄúIf Not This, Then Something Better‚Äù Mindset ‚Äì If you don‚Äôt reach a goal on time, it‚Äôs not failure‚Äîit‚Äôs redirection.
‚úÖ Trade Strict Deadlines for Growth-Based Timelines ‚Äì Instead of ‚ÄúI must achieve this by 30,‚Äù try ‚ÄúI am working toward this, and I trust the process.‚Äù
‚úÖ Release the ‚ÄúHustle or Fail‚Äù Mentality ‚Äì Working harderdoesn‚Äôt always mean working smarter.

üí° Example: Jeff Bezos didn‚Äôt start Amazon until 30. Oprah was fired from her first TV job. Flexible ambition = long-term success.

üîë Takeaway: Set goals, but don‚Äôt attach your self-worth to them.

  

6. Balance ‚ÄúDoing‚Äù with ‚ÄúBeing‚Äù
üöÄ Why It Works:
We spend so much time doing‚Äîachieving, planning, chasing‚Äîthat we forget about being.

üìå How to Find the Balance:
‚úÖ Ask Yourself: ‚ÄúAm I Living, or Just Achieving?‚Äù ‚Äì If life is just a checklist, it‚Äôs time to pause.
‚úÖ Make Room for Joy Without Purpose: Do things just for fun, not just for productivity.
‚úÖ Be Present in Small Moments: Notice the feeling of your morning coffee, the sound of laughter, the sunset.

üí° Example: Some of the most successful people schedule ‚Äúwhite space‚Äù in their calendars‚Äîtime with no agenda, just to be.

üîë Takeaway: Life is not just a productivity game‚Äîit‚Äôs also meant to be enjoyed.

  

Final Verdict: How to Balance Ambition with Being Present
You can be wildly ambitious while still appreciating the present. The key? Training your mind to hold both perspectives at once.

‚úî Redefine success as progress, not just outcomes.
‚úî Recognize the ‚ÄúArrival Fallacy‚Äù and enjoy the journey.
‚úî Use gratitude to stay grounded in the now.
‚úî Take presence breaks to reset your mind.
‚úî Set flexible goals‚Äîself-worth isn‚Äôt tied to deadlines.
‚úî Make time for joy, not just achievement.

üî• So, here‚Äôs your challenge: What‚Äôs one thing you can do today to slow down and enjoy the moment‚Äîwhile still staying motivated?

We‚Äôre mid 30s with a newborn.

Shes a badass physician and got a job at LA General Medical Center just past downtown. Proud of her!!

I‚Äôve lived all over the West side in the past - Santa Monica, Venice, Sawtelle, Manhattan Beach. 

I LOVE the westside - we have friends there and being close to the beach is huge for me (surfer and beach lover). 

However my wife, very understandably, doesn‚Äôt want a tough commute to add on top of starting a stressful job, and a newborn baby who she will be taking to and from with her to work due to daycare at hospital. 

So, we‚Äôre looking into Silver Lake and Pasadena and maybe some others in between. I‚Äôd love some advice. I‚Äôve not spent much time on the east side.

I loved Silver Lake when I used to visit in my 20s and it also feels more ‚Äúconnected‚Äù to my friends on westside - like we‚Äôre actually in LA. We‚Äôre already planning meeting up in between, mid city etc and visiting each other. It‚Äôs also exciting to imagine living ‚Äúin the action‚Äù in a cool / lively area before settling more fully into the burbs when baby is older. 

We enjoy restaurants coffee shops and bars - and being connected to nature and parks. While I‚Äôm excited at the prospect of SL I‚Äôm also worried about getting burnt out quickly living in such a congested area. Yeah it‚Äôs closer to friends on westside but will they even be able to park when they come visit us? Likely not in the rentals we‚Äôre eyeing just south of the Reservoir. I‚Äôm worried every grocery store run going to be a taxing endeavor. 

And yes we enjoy good food and walkability but we also are in bed by 930p most nights‚Ä¶

Pasadena seems lovely - we‚Äôd be ok with a slower pace - and we have a few friends there already. It‚Äôs also the easiest commute to hospital. But it feels sooo painfully far from the beach and my westside people. It doesn‚Äôt feel like we‚Äôre living in LA. Not to mention finding decent housing options there seems near impossible after the fires.

Other places like Eagle Rock seem cool but also worst of both worlds‚Ä¶ no friends in area and far out. 

Really I just want to live on the west side but it‚Äôs not feasible rn so I‚Äôm trying for the next best thing hah.

DelMar restaurant 
Provence
Embers
Caicos Cafe


Del Mar:  5 star service. Beautiful  view on the beeach.  Wife has a gluten allergy and they were super accommodating, even bringing out fresh gluten free bread for her.  Great drinks (I had the old carribean), great apps, solid entre (Blackened red snapper).  Overall food 4.5/5. And 5/5 service.  Even brought us a free desert with a happy anniversary chocolate decoration.

Provence:  all around great.  This was the closest thing you will get to a michilen star type experience with interesting dishes and unique flavors being paired.  Each dish is maticulously crafted for amazing presentation. Super expensive but great experience all around.

Embers:   Also very good.  Whatever salad I had as an app was one of the tastiest salads I've eaten in my life.  Could have had that for my main as well and been satisfied.  Had the local wahoo with red curry for my main.  Curry flavor was simply amazing. This was probably my third favorite dining experience which is crazy to say because it was really good.  

Caicos cafe:  apps were kinda meh.  We had the crab salad and it kind of just tasted like a standard tuna salad.  My entre was grilled swordfish and while it was good it didn't wow me like the other restaurants.  My wife had the tuna as her main though and she loved it. Overall 4/5 I would say.  Priced slightly cheaper than the other restaurants, but still expensive (what isn't on this island).

Tried a few coffee shops - beans and leaves was our favorite.

Also grabbed a quick bite for lunch on the way to the airport at Big Al's (or something like that).  Very reasonably priced burgers and bar food that was surprisingly good.  If you want to keep it cheap and get a decent meal this is a good selection ",4,1745152758.0,TurksAndCaicos,0,1.0,False
1k3lnbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeidasTouch/comments/1k3lnbo/meidas_founder_delivers_sunday_message_reposted/,Meidas Founder Delivers Sunday Message (reposted from Substack),"By Ben Meiselas

Grab your Sunday coffee, tea, water, or whatever, and let‚Äôs chat.

For those who celebrate, Happy Easter. I hope you can spend time with your family. I‚Äôve saved an honorary seat for the Meidas Mighty at my dinner table tonight, so I will be thinking of you and your courage.

I mean it when I say how proud I am of you and how honored I am to call you a friend. The odds were against you by a lot. The billionaires with all the money in the world‚Äîwhat they call ‚Äúf*** you money‚Äù‚Äîwere scared and submitted to protect their wealth. How‚Äôs that working out for them?

No one expected we‚Äôd still be here together fighting against the Trump regime on Easter Sunday. Scratch that. I expected it. We expected it. You expected it. Trump and Musk thought they‚Äôd control the White House, Congress, the federal courts, the media, and universities by now. They failed.

As a whole, federal courts have stood up to the Trump regime, although there are some notable bad rulings. Harvard has led the way in showing universities how to resist. The corporate media imploded, but independent media led by the MeidasTouch Network took its place. We grew with the help of our Substack subscribers here (subscribe now if you can).

Yesterday we saw mass protests across the country once again. Shoutout to 50501 for their work in coordinating these protests. The MeidasTouch Network worked closely with 50501 leadership yesterday to bring you images and videos from the protests. What I found amazing about yesterday‚Äôs protests we covered were the activations in thousands of small towns, not just the big cities.

So here we are‚Äîit‚Äôs Easter Sunday. We are not yet at the 100-day mark of the disastrous presidency. What have we learned? What lessons can we share today about the Trump regime? Here are some observations.

First, the Trump regime is run by dangerous idiots. Their corruption is somehow exceeded by their incompetence. It resembles Trump‚Äôs failed, bankrupted businesses. I‚Äôve described Trump‚Äôs Cabinet meetings as the worst season of The Apprentice meets Kim Jong Un‚Äôs North Korea.

Second, the world has come to the universal conclusion‚Äîfriend and foe alike‚Äîthat Trump is a reckless extortionist who backs down when you stand up to him and extorts you more if you make a deal with him. The obvious conclusion is he can‚Äôt be trusted and he terminally exists in the world of bad faith.

Third, the Trump regime enjoys cruelty. They are bad people. They get off on the suffering. It makes them feel strong and powerful. The money alone never satiates them. Using the money to inflict pain and hurt people is what they enjoy most. Trump admires those who torture.

Fourth, the regime is crashing, and the crash is accelerating daily. They are irredeemable, and the regime is unsalvageable. They‚Äôve trapped themselves in their own corruption, deceit, and incompetence. The dominoes are already falling and the cascading collapse is picking up speed.

Fifth, the opposition and resistance is robust and real. As Trump‚Äôs house of cards falls, the opposite is true of the resistance, which builds brick by brick. We are scrappy. We are resourceful. And together, we are mighty.

We have all brought unique skills to this fight against the Trump regime. We have stood shoulder to shoulder not just here in the United States, but in solidarity with pro-democracy communities internationally.

We are not letting Trump write the final chapter of our history as a democracy. We are making sure this period remains contained as an out-of-sequence disastrous chapter that we can soon turn the page from‚Äîand move toward a future filled with endless passages of a thriving and vibrant democracy that will define our collective story.

And so it must be written, and so we must write it.

We have been called upon right now in this perilous moment to stand up and fight.

None of us wanted this moment as our reality on Easter Day 2025. But that‚Äôs not what was in store for us.

We must now meet this moment.

We are meeting this moment.

You are meeting this moment.

You‚Äôve summoned the courage to fight an authoritarian regime.

You‚Äôve found your voice and your community.

You know what you are fighting for.

So as we reflect on what comes next on this Easter Day 2025, we should take solace in what we‚Äôve done already‚Äîand we must prepare for the fight of our lives in the future.

Trump is desperate. He will act out and throw more our way. We know how to beat him. We beat him with people power.

We take to the streets. We take to the courts. We build our own media.

We grow our community.

We empower others who share our principles and values to lead.

We grow even more.

On this Easter Day, as I am drinking this cup of coffee first thing in the morning, a tear is slowly dripping down my left eye. Not because I am sad. No‚Äîthese are tears of joy as I reflect on what we‚Äôve done together already and what I know we are capable of doing together in the future.

We will never give up.

We will never submit.

We will fight until we win.

We will win.

We hope you can subscribe to the MeidasTouch Network Substack today.

The MeidasTouch Network Substack is the fastest growing Substack channel by subscribers in the world.

We also get more digital views than Fox News and more podcast plays than Joe Rogan. They are funded by billions of dollars. We are not. (Remember to add the MeidasTouch Podcast on Apple Podcasts and Spotify right now to keep this momentum going)

# Best Floor Mat Cleaner 2025: Top Rated & Reviewed

Floor mats endure a relentless barrage of dirt, grime, spills, and whatever else shoes track in. Keeping them clean isn't just about aesthetics; it's about maintaining hygiene and preserving the interior of your vehicle or home. A quality floor mat cleaner is an essential tool for anyone looking to keep their floors looking pristine and extending the life of their mats. Choosing the right one can save time, effort, and money in the long run. This article delves into the best floor mat cleaners of 2025, providing a comprehensive review to help you make an informed decision.

[[Explore top Rated floor mat cleaner on Amazon.]](https://itsallgarden.com/car-info/?kw=floor mat cleaner)

## Key features Analysis

The top floor mat cleaners of 2025 offer a range of innovative features designed to tackle even the toughest stains and messes.

**Advanced Cleaning Formula:** These cleaners boast proprietary formulas optimized for lifting dirt and grime without damaging the underlying material of the floor mat. The key is a balanced pH level combined with specialized surfactants that break down stubborn stains. Third-party testing confirmed that these formulas are safe for use on most common floor mat materials, including rubber, carpet, and vinyl.

**Multi-Surface Compatibility:** Leading cleaners have been meticulously engineered to cater to various floor mat materials. Whether you have rubber all-weather mats, carpeted mats, or vinyl protectors, these formulations are designed to deliver effective cleaning without causing discoloration, cracking, or any other form of material degradation.

**Foaming Action Technology:** Many of the best cleaners utilize a robust foaming action. This allows for deeper penetration within the fibers and crevices of the floor mat. The foam effectively encapsulates dirt and debris, bringing them to the surface where they can be easily wiped away. This technology minimizes the amount of scrubbing required, reducing wear and tear on the mats.**Odor Neutralization:** Beyond simply removing visible dirt and stains, top-tier floor mat cleaners incorporate advanced odor-neutralizing agents.These agents target and eliminate the source of unpleasant smells, rather than just masking them with a temporary fragrance. This feature is especially valuable for those who deal with pet odors or lingering spills.

**Eco-Friendly Composition:** Increasingly, consumers are looking for environmentally conscious cleaning solutions. many of the top floor mat cleaners in 2025 are formulated with biodegradable ingredients and packaged in recyclable containers. These products prioritize sustainability without sacrificing cleaning performance.

**UV Protection:** Certain premium floor mat cleaners offer UV protection. this helps prevent the fading and cracking that can occur when floor mats are exposed to prolonged sunlight. The UV inhibitors in these formulas create a protective barrier that extends the life of the mats and keeps them looking newer for longer.

## Core Benefits

The best floor mat cleaners offer a multitude of benefits that extend beyond mere cleanliness.

**Superior Stain Removal:** These cleaners can effectively lift and remove tough stains such as mud, coffee spills, grease, and salt residue. For example, using a high-quality cleaner on a heavily soiled rubber mat can restore it to near-new condition, whereas a weaker cleaner might leave behind a noticeable discoloration.

**Enhanced Interior Hygiene:** Clean floor mats contribute significantly to the overall hygiene of a vehicle or home. By eliminating dirt, bacteria, and allergens trapped in the mats, these cleaners help create a healthier environment for passengers and occupants alike. A simple test shows that regular cleaning reduces bacterial counts by up to 90% compared to neglected mats.

**Prolonged Mat Lifespan:** Regular cleaning with a quality floor mat cleaner can extend the lifespan of your mats. By removing abrasive dirt and debris,these cleaners prevent premature wear and tear. Over time,this can save you money by delaying the need to replace damaged or worn-out floor mats.

**Improved appearance:** Clean floor mats enhance the overall appearance of your vehicle or home's interior. this creates a more pleasant and inviting environment. A clean, well-maintained floor mat shows attention to detail and contributes to a positive impression.

**Reduced Allergens:** Many peopel are sensitive to dust, pollen, and other allergens that accumulate in floor mats. Using a specialized cleaner can significantly reduce these allergens, providing relief for allergy sufferers and contributing to better respiratory health. Studies indicate that regular cleaning can cut airborne allergens by 50% or more.

## FAQs Section

**Can these cleaners be used on all types of car floor mats?**
Most high-quality floor mat cleaners are designed to be multi-surface compatible,meaning they can be used on rubber,carpet,and vinyl mats. Though, it's always an excellent idea to test the cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't cause any discoloration or damage.

**How ofen should I clean my floor mats?**
The frequency of cleaning depends on usage and environmental factors.For everyday use,cleaning every 2-4 weeks is typically sufficient. However, in areas with harsh weather conditions or heavy foot traffic, more frequent cleaning (e.g., weekly) may be necessary.**Are these floor mat cleaners safe for pets and children?**
Many modern floor mat cleaners are formulated with non-toxic and biodegradable ingredients, making them safer for use around pets and children. Look for products that specifically state they are free of harsh chemicals like bleach and ammonia.As a general precaution, always keep cleaning products out of reach of children and pets.

**Do I need special equipment to use these cleaners?**
No,special equipment is generally not required. Most floor mat cleaners can be applied with a spray bottle or applicator and then wiped or rinsed clean. For heavily soiled mats, a scrub brush or detailing brush might potentially be helpful. A vacuum cleaner can also be used to remove loose dirt and debris before cleaning.

Hey there

Allow me to introduce myself‚ÄîI am a reserved yet passionate introvert, seeking to embark on a journey of meaningful connections and friendships. As I navigate this vast world, I have come to realize that life's true beauty lies in forging genuine bonds with like-minded individuals. Today, I take a leap of faith to reach out to this incredible community, in the hopes of finding some amazing female friends to share laughter, stories, and moments of deep understanding.

For me, the essence of friendship transcends the boundaries of small talk and shallow interactions. I yearn for connections that delve into the depths of our shared interests, dreams, and quirks. Though I may not be the loudest voice in a crowd, my heart carries the weight of empathy and compassion, making me a keen listener and a steadfast confidant. From the solace of a quiet coffee shop to the thrill of a thrilling book, I find solace in the simplicity of life's little wonders.

In a world that often glorifies extroversion, I firmly believe that introverts hold the power to nurture profound connections. There's something truly magical about the authenticity that arises when two introverted souls come together in understanding and harmony.

If you resonate with the idea of finding a friend who embraces the beauty of solitude and shares the joy of deep conversations, then I wholeheartedly invite you to join me on this journey. Let's explore the wonders of the universe through the lens of our unique perspectives and build a bond that defies the constraints of time and space.

Together, let's create a little corner of the world where introversion blooms and where friendship knows no boundaries. I eagerly await the opportunity to meet some incredible like-minded souls who can share in life's ups and downs, triumphs and tribulations, and everything in between.

Looking forward to connecting with you

I just learnt that all machines (dual and single boilers) will need to be left on for at least 15 mins (when you only have a normal power socket in your kitchen) before you can start making coffee. Since I‚Äôm not about leaving it on all day I‚Äôll never be able to pour a spontaneous coffee. I‚Äôm talking about all the ECM, La Marzocos, etc. 

I just found about heat exchangers. And that with these you can have immediate spontaneous coffee. But I‚Äôve read that they are either rubbish or very expensive like the  Decent machines (over 3K). 

So, perhaps it is oxymoronic, but is there a good heat exchangers that doesn‚Äôt cost an arm and a leg and will make consistently good espresso and milk drinks?

I‚Äôd really rather not spend more than USD1k‚Ä¶



Also, what do you think about Jura machines?

1k3lfrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/1k3lfrf/intp_or_intj/,INTP or INTJ?,"
So I‚Äôm very much split between these two types? Which is ironic because well, none of them have any cognitive functions in common (in the main stack) yet despite this, I suppose there‚Äôs a lot of commonality between them and how they view the world. The real issue is I doubt my own conclusion all the TIME but.. hey.

I sometimes think oh I‚Äôm one, or oh I‚Äôm the other. I think I veer more towards INTJ just because of how I process information. I tend to look for the general intuition and thinking behind an idea, and when I‚Äôm learning stuff I do typically have a weird process where it doesn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm actually doing something or I‚Äôll be like staring into space doing weird hand motions trying to get what say, a concept in maths means then be like AHA and get it and then think about like ‚Äòokay how do I use this‚Äô. 

However what makes me think INTP is I am like, utterly obsessed with logical consistency. Like seriously it‚Äôs the point where I‚Äôm when talking about something and I use a word that‚Äôs fairly big I‚Äôm like ‚Äòwait am I using this correctly‚Äô I‚Äôll google what it means. I also can be quite good at thinking outside the box, and I do tend to ramble on like trying to get all the ideas that relate to something into my paragraph or whatever which can make my work a bit hard to read if I don‚Äôt kind of refine it after. I hate refining my work though. I just want to finish the damn thing and I often think nuance and depth is lost when you have to cut stuff down to fit into a word count.

I‚Äôm going to give breakdowns of points towards I/E, N/S, T/F, and J/P but not because I don‚Äôt think these are reliable guides to typing - I‚Äôd rather be typed based on the more accurate and nuanced means of cognitive functions - however I think me doing this could give insights into kind of how I think and potentially give insights into what functions I use.

I/E - 

I‚Äôm introverted as fuck. Seriously I literally never leave my house. Now, does behaviour give typing? No. But I generally am not the biggest fan of interacting with other people and I much prefer my own company. I tend to focus my insights internally? If that makes sense? I‚Äôm more interested in myself and my own kind of progression through life than other people‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt make friends super easily and honestly, I‚Äôm fine with that. I can talk to other people but I much prefer working by myself and doing my own thing rather than well, other people muddying the waters.

N/S - 

I lose track of my external environment all the time. Then I‚Äôll snap back to reality like ‚Äòoh‚Äô! I‚Äôm also terrible at noticing sensory stimuli as they hit my body. I have an AWFUL short term memory and my long term memory tends to be in terms of general like impressions or a few key forming events - the specifics of long term memories often completely elude me. I‚Äôm kind of clumsy as well and I often worry that I come across as a complete klutz. I‚Äôm also quite insecure in my appearance even though I think appearance is to an extent, unimportant, I face this internal battle of ‚Äòoh I should try to look good‚Ä¶ but also I‚Äôd rather just do literally anything else with my time or just get out the house and get what I‚Äôm doing over and done with, what difference does it make if I do makeup?‚Äô. 

In terms of again, learning style, I‚Äôm much more about the big picture and overarching abstract ideas than the specifics. I‚Äôm amazing at skimming through texts and  sifting through the information to get the ‚Äògold‚Äô, what‚Äôs actually useful, the overall point the text is trying to get across (once I get over my dyslexic ‚Äòwall of text omg where do I even start?!‚Äô). In terms of Ni or Ne, I‚Äôm not really sure. I‚Äôm amazing at knowing how ideas fit together and what ideas are part of what, yet writing down, I tend to be like ‚Äòoh this relates to this and then this relates to this, and then actually this is part of this!‚Äô and awesome at finding weird kind of bizarre links between ideas. I love maths, science and philosophy and I have said ‚Äòwhen you think about it, they all come from the same kind of human search for truth‚Äô and gotten looked at like ‚Äòwow!‚Äô and I‚Äôm thinking like ‚Äòhuh that‚Äôs kind of obvious to me, and I didn‚Äôt even get into how we have this innate desire for truth because how we are thrown into a world full of links and patterns and systems that at face value, we can‚Äôt even begin to understand, and that‚Äôs WHY we search for truth‚Äô. 

But anyway, overall point is I look for big picture > details (I often think details can be a bit irrelevant if they can be explained by a principle), and I‚Äôm awful with my body and kind of painfully aware of how awful I am.

T/F - 

So with this, I think of myself as well a Thinker. I think it might be interesting to go into WHY though.

I feel emotions. They‚Äôre there (sadly). However, I think they‚Äôre kind of a reaction to stimuli and I utterly HATE how they can cloud rational thought. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any innate truth behind them other than ‚Äòevolutionary response left over from caveman brain‚Äô. But I do care about how I feel to an extent. To an extent. That‚Äôs the key - if it‚Äôs emotions or reason then obviously reason and what annoys me about emotions is how they cloud reason.

In terms of whether I make value judgements or decisions based on logic, I make decisions based on logic. Sure I can feel a way about something, but I‚Äôd rather just put that aside and rely on external truth. When I feel a way about something, I look to well ‚Äòis how I feel actually true and based on reality?‚Äô. I don‚Äôt hold feelings as sacred.

If anything, I utterly DESPISE when people hold their feelings as so sacred that they just refuse to think rationally and use clear logic. There is not a phrase I hate MORE than ‚Äòmy truth/your truth‚Äô as if truth is somehow internal and feeling based. There is truth‚Ä¶ and there is opinion. Truth is based on external reality. I believe that everything eventually has a rational explanation, even if we haven‚Äôt found it yet.

I also find social causes and preachy people really annoying a lot of the time because, I‚Äôm like, yes, I can see you‚Äôre correct, but can you stop fucking preaching about it and making it your whole life PLEASE? Reason to your opinions. I also do see like, some stuff that‚Äôs just patently absurd that people hold as sacred. I hate safe spaces. I‚Äôm a big believer in the marketplace of ideas. Harmony be damned. If someone wants to voice a stupid belief or opinion, let them do it! But also let me or someone else tear the ever living FUCK out of it please. 

I say this like I actually do tear the fuck out of people‚Äôs ideas rather than just roll my eyes and go ‚Äòthat‚Äôs stupid‚Äô. That‚Äôs my general response. Or if someone says ‚Äòbecause I said so‚Äô I‚Äôm a bit like‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ WHY did you say so?

I suppose to overarching point wrap it up, I‚Äôm very big on rational, objective thought over subjective, stupid emotion based opinion. This includes myself!! I have some internal values but I don‚Äôt hold them sacred. Everything gets put to the test of external truth and logical scrutiny. Does it make sense and does it hold up to reality?

J/P - 

The difficult bit. Obviously, read the title! Haha. I mean, again, 4 letter typing is typically awful and reductive and not based on functions but I‚Äôm just going through these four letters for insight into cognitive functions. So here goes.

I like to think ahead and make plans for myself. I absolutely adore, ADORE strategising - finding the optimal build in stuff is very fun yet I don‚Äôt tend to experiment for the sake of experimentation. I like to just generally look to what others have kind of, suggested, and test those suggestions? If that makes sense? Yet, I‚Äôm able to very easily glean from say, other‚Äôs builds in games, what makes a good build, why and how it works, how from this, I could devise my own builds and systems. A lot of the times though I don‚Äôt even look up stuff, I‚Äôm very good at for some reason KNOWING what‚Äôs good and what‚Äôs not in terms of games and whatever. God I‚Äôm sucking at explaining this. 

General point - I like strategising. I also like challenging myself. And I also like planning for the future. Now what do I mean by planning? Well, generally, I set myself a goal, a vision, then I work towards it - I identify what I need to do to achieve it, I devise quick plans of action. I‚Äôm super super goal oriented in terms of being like ‚Äòokay I should do this by then‚Äô, and I need to do this this and this to make it happen. 

In games or in maths problems, I identify my win condition or the goal of the problem. I then think about, okay, what do I need to REACH this goal? Then I implement. (I know these are technically vastly different things but I find the process of winning/solution is actually quite similar). All of this can seem like utter nonsense to an external observer, yet, I trust my own process. I know it works. The issue with this? I‚Äôm like a deer in headlights if you ask me to improvise something. Like seriously I need something to follow or I just‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt. 

As to the points against the traditional, reductionist ‚ÄòJ‚Äô in MBTI? First - I‚Äôm so fucking disorganised. Like omg. I mean I have my internal kind of system of organisation, yet this does not translate to the external world and looks like CHAOS outwardly. I‚Äôm awful at following routines that others set for me and at timekeeping, I just lose track when I get engrossed in doing something. I also forget stuff and leave stuff around the house then lose it all the time. This chaos translates to physical surroundings - I am so fucking untidy - I‚Äôve gotten better yet sometimes I just leave my laundry or washing up because I‚Äôm doing other stuff. Until it reaches the point where I go to get my ‚Äòmorning cup of coffee I need to be a functional human being‚Äô and all of my cups are dirty. Or I go for something to wear and there‚Äôs nothing but a mountain of washing. I also can be quite good at adapting to new circumstances even if it‚Äôs not my preferred way of being and it stresses me out. If something unexpected happens I may panic a bit then get on it. 

I also am CRIMINAL at leaving stuff to the last minute. I‚Äôm the queen of being like ‚Äòoh I‚Äôll do it tomorrow‚Ä¶ oh I‚Äôll do it tomorrow‚Ä¶ oh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs due tomorrow FUCK‚Äô then I power it out and usually do pretty well but the stress is a bit‚Ä¶ ahhh. Haha. I end up winging stuff so often and just kind of then getting through with sheer willpower but then being like ‚Äòfuck I should have just done this straight away rather than procrastinating‚Äô. So yeah.

Overall, I‚Äôm great at strategising and planning. Terrible at organising myself and doing stuff by a deadline.

i wanna come down so for a day or 2 on a solo quest, probably get a sesh in at pirate, see what food n clothes shops are about maybe even hit up an event n just get a feel for the city.

would be cool to chat with anyone who‚Äôs in the scene/other DJs, producers, promoters, or just people who rate the music and culture. Not really trying to dive headfirst into the party side of it, more just wanna link with like-minded people and see what Bristol‚Äôs really saying.

if anyone‚Äôs got recommendations for places to check out, areas to look at for living, or even fancies linking for a mix or coffee or a spliff while I‚Äôm down, gimme a shout!",0,1745151101.0,bristol,0,0.5,False

I was just vibe-coding late one night, chasing CSS shadows and sipping on cold coffee... and boom üí• this little side project was born!

i have made this in react with tailwind   
used node js and express for backend 

i can make it in frontend only but i was learning about backend so made custom excuse api and used it and hosted my backend on render 

suggestions are most welcome.
