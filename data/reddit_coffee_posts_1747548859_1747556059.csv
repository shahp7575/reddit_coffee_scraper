1kpexbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBYFAN/comments/1kpexbn/monty_explicitly_spells_out_how_important/,"Monty explicitly spells out how important collaboration with other creatives was in building RWBY, saying how he wanted to work with Kerry and Miles on it in creating the world and how he mostly gave them broad strokes. and it's mentioned how they all put the show bible together","**Monty Oum \[Creator and Director\]**: It’s the stories I’ve always wanted to tell versus the idea I came up with about, a little over a year ago. And we were talking about doing another show, and I just kind of half-asleep came up with the idea of a color rule for a bunch of characters. The red, white, black and yellow color scheme was something that was very prominent even in my previous work, so I started matching names up, matching ideas up. Also thinking about like, some of the ideas I’d stored up over the years. At some point or another the word ‘RWBY’ came to me.

**Monty**: Starting the show out originally, I designed the original character, Ruby, as well as going into the other characters. So once I had the first trailer done, and thinking about the rest of the characters for the show, I started bringing in other artists who I had watched for years. People I’d always said “someday I’ll work with them, someday I’ll have them design for me.” And when I was certain about having certain characters, I first contacted an artist I admired and found over DeviantArt. Her name was Ein Lee, she’s actually from Taiwan, and I found her art probably well over five years ago, and just loved her art style, and therefore wanted to incorporate it into my characters. So, I would do rough designs for team RWBY as well as designs for team JNPR, and she would flesh that out to be even further. To the point where eventually I didn’t need to design characters anymore, she started designing a bunch of the rest of the characters down the line.

**Monty**: The second person I brought on to RWBY was Kerry, because we had just been having conversations about the kind of show we could make. I’d been working with Miles on Season 10. He was writing scenes while I was making scenes, and so the three of us would have a lot of meetings and collaborate on the show to the point where I just started coming up with the broad strokes eventually and they had pretty much written the bulk of the show. Collaboration’s a big deal here, and I tried to include as many people as I can.

**Kerry Shawcross \[Co-writer\]**: Right after RvB ended, we wanted to just go straight into RWBY, but that was like right when we were going into commercial season. So we would work our normal hours here. Like 10 to 7-ish, then we would go back to one of our apartments and just start writing.

**Miles Luna \[Co-writer\]**: Monty really was enthusiastic about having these characters that may appear really one-dimensional for like the first few scenes that you see them, but the longer you get to know them, you realise “Oh, Yang isn’t just a dumb blonde party girl. She’s a very caring and nurturing girl, that has had to essentially be there for Ruby when she was young.”

**Kathleen Zuelch \[Producer\]:** When Monty and Miles and Kerry came to me, and really took me through the story. I started becoming a huge believer, because I’m a big fan of old school, traditional fairy tales, I love the Brothers Grimm, I love all the Snow White, and I love Little Red Riding Hood. I grew up with all of those stories, and the way that they were very clever in creating this whole world that’s kind of making homage to all of these amazing stories really inspired me to get more on board with what they wanted to do with this whole anime show.

**Taylor McNee (née Pelto) \[Art Director\]:** The world of RWBY, it looks very familiar. We wanted a blend of very classic looking architecture and clothing and cars, but we’re also mixing in this really kind of futuristic feel, like these little touches of some really futuristic stuff like holograms and things that you wouldn’t find in a classic \[inaudible\]. And that’s how we’re making this world unique. Our assets have to go through this pipeline of concept, modelling, texturing, and then finally being able to be put into the 3D program. So we start out with the concept and we usually bring that image into Maya, which is the main 3D software that we use. We have to make a 3D model that looks exactly like the concept that we were given, and it’s quite a process. Basically, we’re pushing polys and extruding stuff until we make the perfect shape, then afterwards we have to UV unwrap it, and then lay everything out on a texture sheet and then paint it, and that will put the image on the model. After that we’re basically done with the model and texture, and then we have to give it to the animators. So then we will set it up in Poser so the animators can grab it and use it for their characters.

**Gray Haddock** **\[Lead Editor\]:** There’s a lot of people working on this show, and there’s a lot of different elements in the pipeline. Editorial kinda serves as a hub between all the different departments, so we help all the communication and coordination between all the different pieces of the show, depending on what part of development that they’re in. Editorial’s getting involved way early in the process, we work alongside the director and the writers and the storyboard artists, and we use the scripts to help develop the storyboards and the camera angles for all those boards. So editorial is responsible for building up the moments of any given scene in terms of the timing and what you wanna look at, at any given moment. So we take the script and we help develop the camera angles and how long you wanna linger in a particular camera angle, look at one character or another or the scene as a whole, and the rhythm of the scene in terms of how long is it gonna take to spend on a particular line or when you want the music to come in, things like that. So we build up a set of animatics with the storyboards, and the first pass of all the audio. This is what then is handed off to the animators, so they can know exactly what is in what shot and how long do they have to animate it in a given shot. And once they’re done animating and their shot’s been approved, then their shot goes to the render farm, we get the rendered shot back and we drop it into the timeline for our episode and finesse the cut a little bit if we have to. But for the most part, we’ve done our job right and everything should pretty much be locked in for the most part by the time we’re getting animation.

**Kerry:** What’s kinda interesting as we’re creating the characters is, we kinda knew what kind of character they’d be. We knew Ruby would act a certain way, we knew Weiss would act a certain way, but we didn’t really know much about them. So we would get to the point where we’d be figuring out plotlines or figuring out dialogue and we’d be like “What *would* Weiss say here? What would Nora say here?” And then it turned into “Oh well now we know.”

**Miles:** Obviously we put a lot of thought into Ruby, Weiss, Blake and Yang before we started writing the dialogue. I remember sitting upstairs and we made a show bible, and we’re starting- we talked about likes, dislikes, personality traits. One of the first things I remember making was “Weiss drinks coffee. Blake drinks tea.”

**Kerry:** It’s important. It sounds not important at all, but it’s very important. It says so much about them

**Miles:** But it’s so important. So much about them, also it says nothing about them. It was just like- that’s just what it is.

**Monty:** I want the show to have resonance with people who are growing up. Cos everyone’s story is the story of kind of becoming who they are. Especially these days when the path of becoming who you are tends to be marginalised with reality. Having done what I’ve done, where I’ve essentially dropped out of high school, started learning this stuff on my own, and therefore land in a position where I get to take the things I was dreaming about when I was growing up and make it real. I tend to get a lot of response from people who are also not sure what they’re meant to become, a lot of them also have the same bright imaginations and with the way the world is, the hardships of what it means to grow up tends to marginalise who you are, and I would hate that to happen to anyone because the future is in creativity and that’s not something you can just manufacture. I actually would like this show to grow up with the people, so unlike most shows where they tend to be ageless or age very slowly, I’d like our fifteen-year-old fans watching fifteen-year-old Ruby, when they’re twenty-five, to be watching twenty-five-year-old Ruby, and to actually have some resonance with the character. Probably one of my favourite types of feedback is to say “I know this person” or “this person is just like me,” and that’s probably one of the best things about coming up with these characters.

It was the first day of the last month of 2024. I was at the same seat I've always been for the past 3 months --- corner cushioned seat at this bougie cafe my housemate from college coined ""was too overpriced and relied heavily on frozens for pastries"" despite him working there.

I was halfway thru my black coffee when I noticed you changed your name in our chats -- just Gabriel. The boy that whispered sweet promises to my ears was left to rot in the tidbits of the past.

Gabriel. No longer my bab, no longer mine.

It was the final straw that sealed a time bomb within me, for the boy I've been bawling my eyes for instead of focusing on all my readings. Days were left empty and hollow.

Thank God for friends, review mates, and Han. I pulled through; from doubt, misery, and you. I waited for you.

Hanggang January lang. After this exam, I'll stop coming back to the thoughts of you. I'll free myself of you.

Waiting wasn't all bad. My days were full of plans, gym, and anxiety of the ALEs kept me less from you. And once January was done, so we're my hopes of you.

1kpeusc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kpeusc/aio_for_wanting_to_end_our_friendship_even_after/,AIO for wanting to end our friendship even after reconciling?,"This is a story that is going to require a lot of context, so please bear with me. 

Me (20F) and my friend (22M) met last year, and originally he was interested in me romantically. We went on three dates, on the third one I realized he wasn't the one and I rejected him. He was okay with it, said we could be friends, so we just continued being friends. 

  
Fast forward to April this year, I notice my friend is being a lot colder to me than usual. He gives me a call one day and tells me he wants to talk to me about something. We talk, and he tells me he's still kinda hurt about the way I rejected him. In his own words, ""what you did was grimace and say 'let's just be friends', I thought I still had a chance with you"". And he essentially made me explain why I wasn't more upfront, and I apologized. Okay, whatever. Not a big deal.

A couple hours later, he sends me a text admitting he was lying about what was bothering him, and sent me a voice message about what the real issue was. Basically, him and my two other guy friends were having a conversation about the rice purity test or something like that, maybe the BDSM test, idk. But either way, I guess you could say it was an explicit topic. I was visibly uncomfortable and tried to zone out, generally I don't feel comfortable with those topics, especially not around a guy I rejected. I wasn't even involved in the conversation, I was just a bystander. My friend says he felt like I was judging him for having that conversation and for having sexual interests, and said he felt really annoyed with me for that. I responded by telling him I was deeply hurt he just assumed I was being judgmental, thinking less of him for having that conversation, just because I was uncomfortable in the situation. I also explained that, no, that didn't make me think less of him. I was just uncomfortable. 

His response? He pretty much got defensive and mad. He brought up all the times I had been judgmental in the past, and small things I've lied about in the past like what movies I've seen or haven't,  what coffee shops I've been to or haven't, including some thing I DIDN'T lie about (bc he said it was relevant to the argument). He also made it important to tell me I have ""prudish behavior"" and it's really easy to assume I was judging him for sexual interests because of my religion. In the end, I decided to just take a deep breath and de-escalate the drama by apologizing for the bad things I've done on my behalf and re-iterate that I didn't think less of him for that conversation. Eventually he chilled out too, apologized for the things he said, and we technically reconciled. I thought I would get over it and be able to go back to normal. 

But honestly? Ever since that conversation, I haven't been able to look at him the same way again. I can't get it out of my head that he just had to tell me I have ""prudish behavior"", it feels like he was sexually profiling me, and that deep down inside he's still bitter about me rejecting him, even though he claims he's not anymore. He still resents me, and doesn't see me as a friend but rather a female friend who rejected him, if that makes sense. Especially because of how defensive he got when I honestly responded to him about being hurt, and the fact that he had to make it about my religion. Things just don't feel the same anymore, and I don't even like seeing him in group settings. AIO for not wanting to be around him anymore? I definitely don't think I've always been a good friend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. ",1,1747555435.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

Main issues are:

1. Overflowing drip tray with indicator stuck down.

2. Frequent insert funnel warning when insert is fully on & inserted correctly.

3. Occasional skipping of heating on first drink, pump just pushes water through without the initial heating so coffee isn’t up to temp.

4. Needing to reset barista assist every 3-4 weeks as it gets stuck on a size which is clearly incorrect.

5. Occasional loud rattling when pumping water through. 

Machine is frequently cleaned, descaled monthly & makes 2-3 double espressos a day between me & my partner.

1kpemfq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kpemfq,Someone dumped them at the side of the road. I took them in.,"It’s Sunday afternoon here in SEA.

I came home at 4.30am after a night out, slept for a couple hours, somehow woke up super refreshed. Felt like going for a morning stroll, but I had the odd feeling that I wanted/needed to take the car, as opposed to my crotch rocket. I thought, ehh why not, I haven’t driven the car in a week anyway — might as well go for a coffee drive.

I pulled up to my usual coffee joint, grabbed my order and stood at the side of the road; sipping iced coffee while I watch literbikes and Kawasaki H2’s and Porsches and whatnot buzz by.

It wasn’t long before I heard a very loud meeping yelp, typical of a young kitty. I thought, wait where did that came from?

I looked left, right, front, back, up, down,… and saw that box in the first pic. I was like… Oh no. Oh hell naw.

But yep. Hell yep. Inside the box is a couple of teenie weenie kitties. That was the yelping I heard — it was their cry for help/warmth/food, I guess.

I legitimately panicked for a while; thinking about whether I should take them, which vet do I bring them to, can I take care of them…

First thing that came across my mind, amidst the mental chaos, was the vet I brought my rescues to. They were good and not particularly expensive, but a tad far. I looked up their location on Google Maps to be sure. Okay, perfectly drivable. What next? What next? Do I do it? Do I not do it? Do I realize that this might potentially turn into a long-term commitment, or god forbid, they take a turn for the worse?

It took me a bit of pacing back and forth and finishing my coffee before I thought, fuck this shit, I’m bringing them. I put them, still on the box, in my passenger floorwell. As I was driving away from the coffee shop, I remember one of my biker friends (who happens to be a crazy cat dude and a father of 13 or so beautiful cats; beating my own count of 10 lovely kitties) happened to be hanging out just a few blocks away. I pulled up to him, asked him to jump into the car, and asked if he’d ride along to the vet. Thankfully he was more than willing to.

The vet determined that they’re both boys, approximately a week old. She taught me how to express them before and after feeding them, as well as how to syringe-feed them the special kitten milk. They’re a bit low on temperature (IIRC they were both at around 35°C), so she recommended that I warm them up, but they’re okay otherwise — no ticks or anything. The vet then sent me away with a couple of small syringes and some kitten milk powder.

From the vet, I stopped at pretty much every hardware store I came across. None had filament bulbs in stock, all they had were LEDs. I was close to giving up, but I decided I’d go home first, house them somewhere comfortable and safe, then continue the search.

At home, I told my mom about the whole ordeal, and how I was unable to find filament bulbs to keep them warm, and that I’d probably have to order them online. She then pointed to the standing light fixture at the far end of the living room — which had 4 filament E27 bulbs, all bright and warm.

1kpejca,https://i.redd.it/2e4ni7aevh1f1.jpeg,Trading two Bianchis in a day,"New bike day! And somewhat of an interesting story how I came home with that beauty yesterday. 

Two months ago I bought an Oltre Comp second hand. Looked fine from 30 minutes of inspection, weather wasn't great, it was pretty overcast that day. Seller explained he had back pains and couldn't ride anymore.

I agree to buy and make a contract to protect both parties. In the ""observations"" section seller says nothing to report. 

On the way back, weather gets better and I need to stop to charge my EV. The bicycle stands on top of my car and I notice some cosmetic flaws on the frame. Damn didn't see that.

The next day I inspect further I now notice a chip on the fork. Damn this one is on me, that's a good 1 by 1cm chip. 

I contact the seller and ask if the bike had a crash. ""No crash"". 

I inspect more and I find more small issues on the frame. 

I'll ride the bike only 2 times in two months but never in full confidence. 

Last Sunday I go for a short ride with a neighbor. I ride hard at some point on not very smooth road. I'll later tell my neighbor that was stupid because ""I don't trust the fork and frame"". I don't clean the bike immediately when I come home. 

In the evening I'm chatting with a random redditor who hesitates between BMC and Bianchi and I comment that I'm not super satisfied with Bianchi quality control. I tell the guy I'll show him the cosmetic issues the next morning. 

On Monday I go downstairs with my coffee to take pictures for the guy. That's where I notice what I believe to be a pretty long crack. 

I freak out. Tell my wife ""I KNEW THIS FRAME HAD BEEN REPAIRED"". 

I call the seller and ask him if he swears the bike had no damage or repair because I'll need to make a warranty claim with Bianchi. And Bianchi would tell me the warranty is void if repaired by some random company. 

""Actually yeah.. that wasn't really a big problem but it's been repainted"". I explain how I trusted a 60+ man with no apparent need for money and how he should have been more honest and declared the repair. We are talking about 3100 euros and an potential unsafe bike. He interrupts me ""I will reimburse you"". 

Meanwhile my neighbor showed up and while I get the seller to admit he lied (or revealed to fail an important information), my neighbor tries to clean the crack. 

It was just a water (with a good amount of isostar in it) stain 😂

But I got the seller to admit!

Yesterday I went to drop the ""old"" 2024 oltre back to the original owner and on the way back, I stopped at a shop that had this ""old"" (2021) but unused Specialissima in di2 11s. 

Originally listed at 3699 with nice looking wheels but aluminum. Went for a test ride and came back to the shop ""I love it! But I'm not taking it"". Seller wanted to see it go and I got a carbon wheel upgrade, two Bianchi bidon holders and took it home for a total price of 3249 euros.

In Belgium, the buyer is protected by law on ""invisible or hard to detect issues"" for two years after purchase. MAKE A CONTRACT WHEN YOU BUY SECOND HAND AND BE THOROUGH.

1kpehwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1kpehwg/my_husbands_friend_keeps_crossing_boundaries_and/,"My husbands friend keeps crossing boundaries and causing fights, yet he is still friends with her.","This has been an extremely contentious subject in our marriage for the past few months. Some context, my husband (26 trans M) has been in military reclass school for the past 5ish months while I (26F) have been holding it down at home alone.  We will call this friend Amanda (trans F). I'm unsure of how old she is, but she seems to be around our age. Amanda and my husband were introduced d/t their similar circumstances when he arrived at the base.  They hit it off fast, especially with the state of politics in the US and the military trans ban leading to them leaning on each other. 

Now, I was very happy for him to have this friend for a while, and thought it was good for him until about a month into their friendship.  Amanda revealed that her wife consented to an open marriage, and then proceeded to proposition my husband.  My husband kindly but firmly shut it down, and then told me about it immediately.  Amanda did not accept this rejection well and continued to make comments/jokes for the next few days, things like how it would ""enhance their friendship"".  It got to a point that he had a frank and firm conversation with her that her comments/jokes had to stop or they couldn't continue the friendship.  

To Amanda's credit, she stopped.....for a time.  Between this first concerning event and now, various things have happened (all of which I have been informed about promptly by my husband).  Nothing quite to the extent of outright propositioning him again, but actions which have made me, my husband, and any of his or my friends uncomfortable to hear.  A few that come to mind are: good morning and good night messages daily, gifting items upwards of $50 without reason, showing up at his morning coffee place daily once she realized that he was there every morning, getting drunk and making sexually aggressive jokes towards him while playing video games together, whispering things into his ear that could have been spoken outloud, hugs that have lingered for too long.

Essentially, there is a pattern of about 4ish weeks.  Amanda will do something that makes him uncomfortable enough that he has a discussion with her and tells her to knock it off. She is good for about a week or two and then starts back up again for weeks 3/4.  It seems to me like Amanda isn't getting emotional fulfillment in her own marriage and is using my husband to fill that role.  This obviously makes me exceedingly uncomfortable.  Now I don't believe in ultimatums in a marriage, and I know that she is a friend who my husband relies on a lot.  They are both going through the same issues with the military, and I work nights as a nurse, so I am asleep most of the time that he is awake. He sees this person as a positive in his life and credits her as the reason he hasn't fallen into a depression.

 I have never once asked him to cut Amanda out of his life; I have asked for reasonable boundaries or behavior changes. However, a few days ago, something one of his guy friends said finally clicked in his head, leading to him deciding to cut her off on his own.  Unfortunately, something happened last night after an event involving both my husband and Amanda that was quite traumatic. I won't get into it here, but this event caused them to begin speaking again, and they ""trauma bonded"" (my husband's words). 

While discussing whether this meant he would continue to communicate with Amanda, we got into a fight.  He got angry when I said I cared about Amanda ""as much as one human should care about another human"" but that I didn't care about her emotions regarding my apathy towards her. He began to yell, which caused me to get emotional and cry. He got angrier and said some things that he now says he regrets, as did I.  He went to bed, I went to work, but now I don't know what to do. I don't want to cause my husband any pain, but I really think this is causing a serious strain on our marriage.

Additional info: There is no doubt in my mind that my husband hasn't and won't cheat on me, let alone with Amanda. Our time apart will be ending in about a month and then he will be coming home and won't be interacting with Amanda in person anymore. 

TL;DR: my husband's friend asked to sleep with him, he said no. She continues to cross boundaries but he wants to remain friends. What do I do? ",0,1747553873.0,marriageadvice,1,0.33,False

1kpedmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortheloveofrwby/comments/1kpedmb/monty_explicitly_spells_out_how_important/,"Monty explicitly spells out how important collaboration with other creatives was in building RWBY, saying how he wanted to work with Kerry and Miles on it in creating the world and how he mostly gave them broad strokes. and it's mentioned how they all put the show bible together","**Monty Oum \[Creator and Director\]**: It’s the stories I’ve always wanted to tell versus the idea I came up with about, a little over a year ago. And we were talking about doing another show, and I just kind of half-asleep came up with the idea of a color rule for a bunch of characters. The red, white, black and yellow color scheme was something that was very prominent even in my previous work, so I started matching names up, matching ideas up. Also thinking about like, some of the ideas I’d stored up over the years. At some point or another the word ‘RWBY’ came to me.

**Monty**: Starting the show out originally, I designed the original character, Ruby, as well as going into the other characters. So once I had the first trailer done, and thinking about the rest of the characters for the show, I started bringing in other artists who I had watched for years. People I’d always said “someday I’ll work with them, someday I’ll have them design for me.” And when I was certain about having certain characters, I first contacted an artist I admired and found over DeviantArt. Her name was Ein Lee, she’s actually from Taiwan, and I found her art probably well over five years ago, and just loved her art style, and therefore wanted to incorporate it into my characters. So, I would do rough designs for team RWBY as well as designs for team JNPR, and she would flesh that out to be even further. To the point where eventually I didn’t need to design characters anymore, she started designing a bunch of the rest of the characters down the line.

**Monty**: The second person I brought on to RWBY was Kerry, because we had just been having conversations about the kind of show we could make. I’d been working with Miles on Season 10. He was writing scenes while I was making scenes, and so the three of us would have a lot of meetings and collaborate on the show to the point where I just started coming up with the broad strokes eventually and they had pretty much written the bulk of the show. Collaboration’s a big deal here, and I tried to include as many people as I can.

**Kerry Shawcross \[Co-writer\]**: Right after RvB ended, we wanted to just go straight into RWBY, but that was like right when we were going into commercial season. So we would work our normal hours here. Like 10 to 7-ish, then we would go back to one of our apartments and just start writing.

**Miles Luna \[Co-writer\]**: Monty really was enthusiastic about having these characters that may appear really one-dimensional for like the first few scenes that you see them, but the longer you get to know them, you realise “Oh, Yang isn’t just a dumb blonde party girl. She’s a very caring and nurturing girl, that has had to essentially be there for Ruby when she was young.”

**Kathleen Zuelch \[Producer\]:** When Monty and Miles and Kerry came to me, and really took me through the story. I started becoming a huge believer, because I’m a big fan of old school, traditional fairy tales, I love the Brothers Grimm, I love all the Snow White, and I love Little Red Riding Hood. I grew up with all of those stories, and the way that they were very clever in creating this whole world that’s kind of making homage to all of these amazing stories really inspired me to get more on board with what they wanted to do with this whole anime show.

**Taylor McNee (née Pelto) \[Art Director\]:** The world of RWBY, it looks very familiar. We wanted a blend of very classic looking architecture and clothing and cars, but we’re also mixing in this really kind of futuristic feel, like these little touches of some really futuristic stuff like holograms and things that you wouldn’t find in a classic \[inaudible\]. And that’s how we’re making this world unique. Our assets have to go through this pipeline of concept, modelling, texturing, and then finally being able to be put into the 3D program. So we start out with the concept and we usually bring that image into Maya, which is the main 3D software that we use. We have to make a 3D model that looks exactly like the concept that we were given, and it’s quite a process. Basically, we’re pushing polys and extruding stuff until we make the perfect shape, then afterwards we have to UV unwrap it, and then lay everything out on a texture sheet and then paint it, and that will put the image on the model. After that we’re basically done with the model and texture, and then we have to give it to the animators. So then we will set it up in Poser so the animators can grab it and use it for their characters.

**Gray Haddock** **\[Lead Editor\]:** There’s a lot of people working on this show, and there’s a lot of different elements in the pipeline. Editorial kinda serves as a hub between all the different departments, so we help all the communication and coordination between all the different pieces of the show, depending on what part of development that they’re in. Editorial’s getting involved way early in the process, we work alongside the director and the writers and the storyboard artists, and we use the scripts to help develop the storyboards and the camera angles for all those boards. So editorial is responsible for building up the moments of any given scene in terms of the timing and what you wanna look at, at any given moment. So we take the script and we help develop the camera angles and how long you wanna linger in a particular camera angle, look at one character or another or the scene as a whole, and the rhythm of the scene in terms of how long is it gonna take to spend on a particular line or when you want the music to come in, things like that. So we build up a set of animatics with the storyboards, and the first pass of all the audio. This is what then is handed off to the animators, so they can know exactly what is in what shot and how long do they have to animate it in a given shot. And once they’re done animating and their shot’s been approved, then their shot goes to the render farm, we get the rendered shot back and we drop it into the timeline for our episode and finesse the cut a little bit if we have to. But for the most part, we’ve done our job right and everything should pretty much be locked in for the most part by the time we’re getting animation.

**Kerry:** What’s kinda interesting as we’re creating the characters is, we kinda knew what kind of character they’d be. We knew Ruby would act a certain way, we knew Weiss would act a certain way, but we didn’t really know much about them. So we would get to the point where we’d be figuring out plotlines or figuring out dialogue and we’d be like “What *would* Weiss say here? What would Nora say here?” And then it turned into “Oh well now we know.”

**Miles:** Obviously we put a lot of thought into Ruby, Weiss, Blake and Yang before we started writing the dialogue. I remember sitting upstairs and we made a show bible, and we’re starting- we talked about likes, dislikes, personality traits. One of the first things I remember making was “Weiss drinks coffee. Blake drinks tea.”

**Kerry:** It’s important. It sounds not important at all, but it’s very important. It says so much about them

**Miles:** But it’s so important. So much about them, also it says nothing about them. It was just like- that’s just what it is.

**Monty:** I want the show to have resonance with people who are growing up. Cos everyone’s story is the story of kind of becoming who they are. Especially these days when the path of becoming who you are tends to be marginalised with reality. Having done what I’ve done, where I’ve essentially dropped out of high school, started learning this stuff on my own, and therefore land in a position where I get to take the things I was dreaming about when I was growing up and make it real. I tend to get a lot of response from people who are also not sure what they’re meant to become, a lot of them also have the same bright imaginations and with the way the world is, the hardships of what it means to grow up tends to marginalise who you are, and I would hate that to happen to anyone because the future is in creativity and that’s not something you can just manufacture. I actually would like this show to grow up with the people, so unlike most shows where they tend to be ageless or age very slowly, I’d like our fifteen-year-old fans watching fifteen-year-old Ruby, when they’re twenty-five, to be watching twenty-five-year-old Ruby, and to actually have some resonance with the character. Probably one of my favourite types of feedback is to say “I know this person” or “this person is just like me,” and that’s probably one of the best things about coming up with these characters.

There's this DnD group I go to. I'm 23. And the goth girl is 20. She wasn't at dnd for quite some time recently cause she has had exams.

But she added me on insta after one of the sessiosns she was at and we dm'd.
I wished her good luck. Sent insta stories which she liked most of em. Then I posted an insta story with my costume for an anime convention which is In June. She dmd me then. And we had a good chat where i flirted a bit and she heart reacted to my flirts. Said she's going too to that anime convention. And that we should go together. I said sure.
Then we had a good long talk. Said ""i don't know you all that well yet.. But I'd love to ;)"" Maybe we could meet on coffee before the convention?

She said sure sure. And then I clarified. Well.. maybe tomorrow. She said she has plans tommorow already. So I clarified when would she be avaliable. She said next week maybe her work schedule will change. I said well then, let me know.

And i haven't chased or messaged since. Should i dm something? Some memes? Or did I just get soft rejected?
The uncertainty is unbereable.

Yesterday i talked to her friend (a guy who goes longer to dnd with me) said ""but well she already has John, they're together."" I couldn't believe it.
I knew they're always together but not.. as a couple. I mean they walk together everywhere. She drives him cause the old dude doesnt have a license. John is 38 years old. And the girl is 20.
They're together he said. He said he couldn't believe it himself but X and Y guys at dnd confirm it. The guy also said they'd been a thing since 17. He heard X (co-organizer) saying after she turned 18 that atleast its legal now.

It's such a wild story. Hersay?

I thought she was free. Which I found weird too considering how attractive she is. But John?

I always seen them together... and thought he was more of a mentor type. But then thought... it might.. be probable?

Like this happens statistically low. But in environments where there's a clear lead (John is the organizer of dnd) in niche communities (check)... sometimes the relationships from a mentor goes.. to something further.

And I know the girl.. doesn't have much of a father figure.

I don't know man. He's twice her age. I stalked John's Facebook profile. He posted a few times, an example post was: thank you (goth girl) for posing for my artwork. And such.

If she doesn't reply this week with plans I'm probably out. But this will hurt.

I don't know if this relationship with John is ... true or is It my brain that just hates uncertainty and grabs the probable worst outcome so it will hurt less once it happens. Going to theraphy on Monday. Will talk about this probably.

Ito nabuhay to kasi may upcoming movie next year yung cartoon na we nerd about and shinare nya yung teaser sa akin then ayan, invite me manuod. 

Guy 2 - met him naman nung 2023. Same scenario kay guy 1 na okay pag uusap namin and we exchanged social media. Ito mej meh kasi parang hindi interesting kausap nung lumipat na ng platform hanggang sa sineen nya nalang message ko and hindi na nag reply. 2023 yung last exchanged ng message namin tapos biglang nagparamdam ngayon.

I haven’t meet these two in person even video and audio call. Hindi ko na din tanda bakit hindi kami lumabas before. So literal na pen pals ganun hehehehehe.

He is around 37 and I’m 22 so the age gap isn’t too great but he is the exact same as I am, I am more mature for my age and have gone through many life events that most people don’t hit until later in life. He will come twice a day and most of the time will stay for 30-40 minutes each time and usually the second time he comes in it’s at the end of his work day and he’s going home after. We share a lot of banter every time and he will sometimes comment on my hair or a random comment about something that I’m wearing, my friends at work have been there sometimes and thinks he is also flirting. I personally don’t care about the age gap because of how well we get along, like my friends will make general conversations if they greet him at the door and say he said something that sounded exactly like you. It’s actually crazy how similar we are in how we perceive the world, I also love how intelligent he is as I’ve always enjoyed those type of conversations.He has also said he feels so comfortable around me and like how freely he can just be himself, anyways there’s a catch… he is married. So should I take it back a few noches or is it all harmless and I’m reading This wrong and it’s possible this is all just a regular customer interaction.

What a gift to know y’all, truly 🥰

A couple of items of business from our first meeting:

1) We’re going to be doing it again ASAP! We’re leaning towards something monthly, unless that somehow becomes cumbersome to arrange or poorly attended. I need your thoughts as quickly as you can about preferred date(s) in June, please! We’d be looking at the 7th, 8th, 14th, 15th, 21st, 22nd, 28th or 29th, most likely. Please let me know as soon as you can which date & time work best for you ♥️

2) Our next meeting will be at a location where alcohol is less central to the locale’s identity, as requested by a few folks ♥️ Please let me know your ideas regarding coffee shops, parks, restaurants or other places that would both suit the vibe and could accommodate a large group.

3) Ideas were flying, it was a beautiful thing! ✨🌈🌊 Our lovely Aden recommended a Discord or Telegram group for ease of communication, and the group thought it was a genius moment! Please for safety reasons ONLY DM ME (do NOT post here, please) your information (first name, last initial, email addy and phone number) if you’d like to be a part! 

4) A ton of beautiful resources, experiences and thoughts were shared across the table - so we’ll be starting a resource thread 🥰 Read something earth-shattering recently? Too excited to breathe about a new idea or practice? Girl or guy or just beautiful human - we got you 💪 And we want to know what inspires you! ♥️ This is your spot, babe 🤗

5) We’re interested in starting our own Witch University, people! What the what does that mean, you ask? Are you aces at herbalism? Brilliant at poppet construction? Epic with astrology, like our very own Lost Cauliflower? Bish, please! We want to know what you know! Let us know what topics you’d be interested in hearing more about, and what topics you might like to teach us about, beauty! 

Lots of love to you all 🥰 Iykyk, and I know I met some soul sisters today ♥️ Excited for what our future holds! ✨🌈🌊

Ever find yourself grinding away, hustling day in and day out, but still feeling like you’re treading water instead of making waves? Yeah, me too. It’s like being on a hamster wheel—you’re all in, but are you really getting anywhere? 

Lately, I’ve been knee-deep in what I like to call **hyper-achievement mode**. You know the one: overloading your schedule, setting the bar ridiculously high, and then *crashing* into a wall because even *the best of us* can’t keep that pace forever! 🏃‍♂️💨 

But here’s my little secret: I’ve discovered a so-called “useless” habit that’s been my game changer. Ready for it? Drumroll, please… **Doing absolutely nothing!** 😲 Sounds counterproductive, right? But hear me out!

### When “Nothing” Becomes Everything:

1. **Brain Recharge**: Just as tech needs a reboot sometimes, so do we. Stepping away from our endless to-do lists gives our minds the space to breathe, wander, and spark new ideas!
   
2. **Reminds You of Joy**: Remember those little pleasures? Watching cat videos, strolling through the park, or just sitting quietly with a cup of coffee? These moments fuel creativity and happiness—two essentials for success! 

3. **Perspective Shift**: Taking a break helps you see where you're pouring energy like a firehose versus where it truly matters. Ever notice how sometimes we’re all in on the “urgent” but not the “important”?

4. **A Little Self-Care Goes a Long Way**: Yes, it sounds cliché, but when was the last time you treated yourself without a “productive” agenda? Whether it’s binge-watching a new show or getting lost in a good book, trust me, it’s worth it.

5. **Allowing for Growth**: Ever heard of the “incubation period” in creativity? It’s when ideas simmer in the background. By stepping back, you're letting the brain do its magic—mixing, matching, and eventually creating something amazing out of what feels like nothing.

### So, What Now? 

Next time you’re in that hyper-achievement zone, consider hitting the brakes for a moment. Can you carve out even **10 minutes a day** for that “useless” habit? What could that look like? 🌱 

If you think about it, “doing nothing” isn’t just sitting on the couch. It’s about giving your mind permission to explore, to dream, and maybe even to spark the next big idea that sends you to your *next level*. 

And hey, I’d love to hear how you all tackle the hustle culture. What’s your go-to strategy for stepping back? Beyond just productivity tips, what’s your favorite way to recharge? Let’s share our little victories and ‘useless’ habits—everyone's got a story! ✨",1,1747552452.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! 🌟

Ever notice how some people seem to breeze through life with a little extra swagger? Like, they’ve cracked some secret code while the rest of us are still trying to figure out what day it is? Well, what if I told you that some of that “unfair advantage” can come from just one daily habit? 

Let’s dive right in. What’s *your* daily habit that puts you ahead of the game? 🎯

For me, it’s **journaling**. Sounds simple, right? But hear me out. Here’s why I think it gives me that extra boost:

- **Clarity of thought**: Putting pen to paper helps me process my feelings and thoughts. It's like decluttering my brain. Remember those tangled headphones from your last trip? Yeah, writing helps untangle the mess up there!

- **Goal setting**: Every morning, I jot down 3 things I want to accomplish. They don't have to be monumental—sometimes it's just “drink more water” or “take a walk.” But checking those off feels *so* rewarding. Who doesn’t love a little victory?

- **Reflection**: At the end of the day, I think about what went well and what I could improve on. It’s like having a mini pep talk with myself. “Hey, you totally crushed that meeting!” or “Okay, maybe don’t forget to charge your phone next time!” 

- **Stress relief**: When the world feels like it’s *too* much, writing it all out is like hitting the reset button. Poof—stress gone! (Well, mostly. Still working on that whole ""adulting"" thing. 😂)

Now, I know journaling isn’t everyone's cup of tea. Maybe yours is meditating, working out, or even something like having your morning coffee while you plan your day. But that’s the beauty of it! There’s no one-size-fits-all. 

So, what about you, fantastic humans? What’s the ONE thing you do every day that you feel gives you that extra edge? Are you a master at time-blocking? Maybe you have a killer morning routine that sets you up for success?

I have observed that hard work generally pays off outside India. But coming back to India , and randomly following some social media content here - looks people are super fast to judge and attack everyone and want to see the drop and want to see successful people dead for some reason. Is my observation wrong ?

I keep scrolling through lot of YouTube videos and random channels kept popping up over the last two years and the creators starting to create business around their fame(which is the whole point of being a content creator) but most of the viral channels and businesses seem to be attacked for some reason or the other. While I don’t support any of the content creator’s mistakes , I feel that any small thing is blown out of proportion and people immediately want to crucify these guys.

1.This girl Alekhya chitti - she appears to be in early 20’s and she managed to create a brand which we should all be doing since our unemployment rate keeps increasing. Our parents want to keep 40 or 50 lakhs loan to send students abroad for studies but no one wants to invest few lakhs and start a brand or business to generate employment. Let’s keep aside the anger she has and the words she used. Not a single person dared to support them or at-least try to reason out with both sides. It makes no sense to ask a brand why they have overpriced things. Overpricing could be done for lots of reasons - maintaining brand exclusivity, team not able to fulfil orders if they reduce prices , making use of demand and supply. Why do we start analysing their costs and trying to deduce how many crores they have earned. Why are we not asking Microsoft or Google engineers why they get paid more to do the same coding and what is the rationale for them getting 1 crore packages? Why don’t we go to Starbucks and ask them why their coffee is 500 bucks a glass 


2. Second example appears to be HK make up something. People are quick to go ahead and attack them and soon that business is going to go out 

3. Missamma handlooms - this young guy is doing an amazing business and I know how hard it is to make a 100 cr brand in 2-3 years. Recently they have started attacking him as well. 

4. Harsha Sai attacked and bought down.

5. Naa anveshana is being arrested now
Lo
All products and businesses have issues, not sure why we don’t want our own businesses and brands to develop. Can’t we forgive small mistakes ?

Update : 
Some backstory on my post. I am also a start-up founder who had an amazing career but chose to start my own startup up India. I won’t lie  the main reason for startup is to earn more money but there is also some patriotism inculcated from my Dad to set up the company in my own small town and give hiring priority to my town and village people as much as possible. Now we are trying to close a seed round which would employee additional 40 people but I keep getting discouraged when I see what is happening and think that this could happen to me as well. In order for founders to take risk they need people to look upto. This mentality is not good for our country. Jai Hind

1kpe2wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1kpe2wc/how_to_call_my_friend_out_for_her_negativity/,How to call my friend out for her negativity?,"Looking for advice about how to deal with / and or call out a friend who is regularly quite negative / cynical / critical. 

Context: We're both in our early/mid-20s and have been friends for roughly 2 years. Closer for the past year.  We met through other friends at uni and have mutual friends etc. Over the years I've had some internal doubts about this friend which stem from the fact that often she is quite negative/critical/complains alot. 

To be specific: Very often when we see each other, she complains heavily about something someone did/said or a situation. It's not just passing comments but a story with conviction and I can see the frustration in her. Often she will say what someone else 'did' and then say what *she* was thinking to herself, as if to prove she was right/smarter about the situation. For example, she works in a cafe and recently one of the coffee machine specialists had to come in to the cafe and fix something as she was closing up shop. She had already closed the machine when he came to do work on it. He must have made a bit of mess because she was frustrated and vented that she'd already cleaned it, that he 'could have messaged to say when he was coming', etc. Another example recently was that she had to look after her family dog as her parents were away and the dog was sick. She complained about the fact that her mum had given her the number of a relative to call if something went wrong . e.g. if the dog declined or got sick etc. saying stuff like ""she's acting as though I'm a teenager"" and ""what would my relative be able to do anyway"". I often feel she doesnt have grace/ acceptance for the situation she is complaining about and that irks me. In general it kind of seems as though she thinks people have bad intentions alot of the time.

She often relays these sorts of annoyances, and my patience is starting to wear thin. I used to engage more but lately i've been going through my own personal growth and a big thing is that I don't want to be around draining / negative energies. 

I don't want to lose this friend as there's so much I love about her. For example, we often have philosophical conversations which i love, eg. about social and political issues, she can be alot of fun, i feel i can share problems with her and feel supported, and we have done alot of things together e.g recently she lived at my house temporarily while she didn't have a house and we had a great time. she can/does also talk really positively and passionately about things she love e.g. bands or sea animals.

 I don't just want to cut her off because of this but rather find a way to address it with her. I'm trying to be more intentional with my friendships so that's what has lead me here. 

Lately when she's complained/criticised I've tried to present the other perspective. For example, saying something like 'oh well X person probably didn't realise X'. To try to balance out the situation she's talking about and almost try to get her to see she might be being unnecessarily harsh / the complaining is not warranted. Often she acknowledges what I said and sometimes is receptive but usually says 'but still' or something like that which doesn't change her perspective. I also try to have a more positive disposition around her, hoping it will rub off. 

Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with complaining / criticising here and there, and if it leads to a productive conversation it can even be useful sometimes. But with her it's often just very unnecessary and unproductive. just complaining / criticizing for the sake of it. partly i think it's just a habit for her / one of the ways she uses to connect even? 

regardless, I am at the point of saying something to her. I'm just not sure how to bring it up  / what to say. i really don't want her to feel as though she can't vent or ever complain around me as she can and that's fine. I just want to make the point that sometimes it feels unnecessary and i don't want to be involved in it. that it even gets in the way of us connecting.

I feel my options are either: 

1. have a sit down conversation 

2. bring it up casually or make a passing comment like ""gee i haven't heard much positivity in all this"" or ""how many things are you going to complain about oday"" 

3. next time it happens, just honestly react in the way i feel. That is, show that I'm fed up and almost 'explode' and say ""jesus christ, I'm so sick of you voicing every complaint and negative thought you have! will you just keep it to yourself!' 

  
Any advice would be helpful. if anyone's had a similar friend or situation, what did you do about it?

Been there, done that! After years of trial and error (and more than a few questionable purchases), I've finally cracked the code on natural skincare routines that actually work.

[Check out my recommended natural skincare products here!](https://190d1g36p-grbw63zz5azoth8e.hop.clickbank.net/)

Let me guess - you're tired of wasting money on products that make big promises but deliver little results. Or maybe you're just overwhelmed by the sheer volume of options out there. Don't worry - I'm about to break it all down in a way that even my skincare-phobic brother could understand. :)

# Know Your Skin Type: The Foundation of Everything

Before you even think about buying that fancy serum your friend swears by, you need to understand what your skin actually needs. Imagine wearing someone else's prescription glasses - doesn't work, right? Same goes for skincare!

# The Major Skin Types and How to Identify Yours

Take a good look in the mirror. Is your face:

* Shiny all over with visible pores and occasional breakouts? Hello, oily skin!
* Tight and flaky with almost invisible pores? You've got dry skin.
* Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin) but normal or dry elsewhere? Welcome to the combination skin club.
* Just right - not too oily, not too dry? Lucky you, that's normal skin.
* Red, itchy, or irritated by many products? You might have sensitive skin.

Not sure? Try the ""blotting paper test"" - dab your face midday with blotting paper. If it picks up oil from all areas, you're oily. Just from the T-zone? Combination. No oil? Likely dry.

Bold statement: Understanding your skin type is single-handedly the most important step in building an effective skincare routine. Skip this, and you might as well throw your money in a blender.

# Morning Routine: Wake Up Your Skin Naturally

Morning routines don't need to be complicated. In fact, simpler is often better. IMO, if your morning routine takes longer than making your coffee, you're doing too much.

# Step 1: Gentle Cleansing

Ever wonder why you need to wash your face in the morning when you just did it last night? Your skin produces oils and sheds cells while you sleep, plus your pillowcase isn't exactly sterile. A morning cleanse removes all that overnight build-up.

Choose a cleanser that:

* Doesn't strip your skin (no tight, squeaky-clean feeling!)
* Matches your skin type
* Contains natural ingredients like aloe, chamomile, or oat extract

For oily skin: Look for gentle foaming cleansers with ingredients like tea tree oil or witch hazel.

For dry skin: Cream or oil cleansers with ingredients like almond oil or shea butter will clean without drying.

For sensitive skin: Fragrance-free formulas with calendula or chamomile can soothe while cleansing.

# Step 2: Tone (But Not Like It's 1995)

Forget those stinging, alcohol-based toners from back in the day. Modern natural toners balance your skin's pH and add a first layer of hydration.

Some of my favorites:

* Rose water for a simple, soothing option
* Green tea toner for antioxidant benefits
* Witch hazel (alcohol-free) for oily skin

Apply by patting gently with hands or a reusable cotton pad. And yes, I've tried the expensive facial mists that basically do the same thing. Save your money and make your own rose water spray instead!

# Step 3: Treatment Serums

This is where you address specific concerns:

* Vitamin C serum for brightening and antioxidant protection
* Hyaluronic acid for deep hydration
* Niacinamide for pore appearance and oil control

Pro tip: Layer thinnest to thickest, waiting about 30 seconds between products. And no, you don't need to use every trendy ingredient simultaneously. Your skin isn't a chemistry experiment!

# Step 4: Moisturize, Always

Regardless of your skin type, moisturizer is non-negotiable. Yes, even for oily skin!

For oily skin: Lightweight gel moisturizers with aloe vera or hyaluronic acid provide hydration without heaviness.

For dry skin: Richer creams with ingredients like shea butter, jojoba oil, or avocado oil give deeper nourishment.

For sensitive skin: Simple formulations with minimal ingredients and soothing components like oat extract or chamomile.

# Step 5: Sun Protection (The Most Important Step!)

If you skip this step, why even bother with the rest? Harsh but true. Sun damage is responsible for up to 90% of visible skin aging.

Look for mineral sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide for the most natural option. And please, please use at least SPF 30 daily - even when it's cloudy, even in winter, even if you're mostly indoors.

# Evening Routine: Repair and Replenish

Nighttime is when your skin does its heaviest repair work. Give it the tools it needs!

# Step 1: Double Cleanse (Game-Changer)

First cleanse: Use an oil cleanser or cleansing balm to dissolve sunscreen, makeup, and surface oils. Massage for at least 60 seconds. (Yes, I time it. Am I obsessive? Maybe. Does it work? Absolutely.)

Second cleanse: Use your regular cleanser to remove any remaining residue and actually clean your skin.

Trust me, the extra minute this takes will completely transform your skin over time.

# Step 2: Exfoliate (But Not Daily!)

Physical exfoliants (scrubs) can be harsh. Instead, try:

* Fruit enzyme exfoliants with papaya or pineapple (gentle enough for sensitive skin)
* Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like glycolic acid from sugar cane or lactic acid
* Beta hydroxy acid (BHA/salicylic acid) for acne-prone skin

Use 2-3 times weekly, not daily. Your face isn't a kitchen counter that needs scrubbing! Over-exfoliation leads to irritation, sensitivity, and actually makes most skin problems worse.

# Step 3: Treatment Time

Evening treatments can be more intensive than daytime ones:

* Retinol or bakuchiol for anti-aging concerns
* Tea tree or niacinamide for breakout-prone skin
* Peptides for firming and elasticity

# Step 4: Hydration Layers

This is where you can really customize:

* Facial oils like rosehip, jojoba, or squalane
* Rich night creams with plant butters
* Overnight masks for intensive treatment

For combination skin like mine: I use different products on different areas. Lighter hydration on my oily T-zone, richer products on my drier cheeks. It's not weird, it's strategic!

# Special Care: Listen to What Your Skin Needs

# Weekly Treatments

Face masks aren't just for selfies (though they do make good Instagram content, I won't lie).

* Clay masks for detoxifying oily areas
* Honey masks for antibacterial properties
* Aloe and cucumber for calming inflammation

# Seasonal Adjustments

Your skin needs different things throughout the year:

* More hydration in winter when heating systems dry out air
* Lighter layers in humid summer months
* Barrier support during seasonal transitions

I always know fall is coming when my skin starts feeling tighter. Time to break out the richer moisturizers!

# Creating Your Personal Natural Skincare Routine

Ready to build your own routine? Here's how to put it all together:

# Start Minimal and Build Slowly

Begin with the essentials:

1. Gentle cleanser
2. Moisturizer
3. Sunscreen

That's it! Use this basic routine for at least two weeks before adding anything else.

# Add Products One at a Time

When introducing new products:

* Add only one new product every 1-2 weeks
* Patch test on your inner arm or behind your ear first
* Take photos to track subtle changes

# Listen to Your Skin

Some days your skin might feel drier or more sensitive than usual. It's okay to adjust your routine accordingly. Skincare isn't religion - flexibility is allowed!

# Common Natural Ingredients and Their Benefits

# Powerhouse Plant Oils

* Jojoba oil: Most similar to human sebum, good for all skin types
* Rosehip oil: Rich in vitamins A and C, great for scarring
* Argan oil: High in vitamin E, ideal for dry or mature skin
* Tea tree oil: Natural antibacterial (but always dilute!)

# Botanical Extracts

* Aloe vera: The ultimate soother for irritation
* Green tea: Potent antioxidant and mild astringent
* Chamomile: Anti-inflammatory for sensitive skin
* Calendula: Healing and calming

# Natural Humectants

* Honey: Antibacterial and draws moisture to the skin
* Glycerin: Plant-derived moisture magnet
* Aloe vera gel: Hydrates without heaviness

# Recognizing Quality Natural Skincare

Not all ""natural"" products are created equal. How to spot the good stuff:

* Read ingredient lists carefully (ingredients are listed in order of concentration)
* Beware of ""greenwashing"" - products that claim to be natural but contain plenty of synthetics
* Look for transparent brands that explain their sourcing and formulation process

Just because something is natural doesn't automatically mean it's good for your skin. Poison ivy is natural too, but you wouldn't put it on your face, would you? :/

# The Ugly Truth About Natural Skincare

Let's keep it real for a minute. Natural skincare has limitations:

* Natural preservatives aren't always as effective as synthetic ones (watch expiration dates!)
* Results may take longer than with conventional products containing more concentrated actives
* ""All-natural"" products often cost more due to quality ingredient sourcing

But for many of us, the benefits outweigh these drawbacks. My sensitive skin has never been happier since I switched to gentler, more natural formulations.

# Putting It All Together: Sample Routines

# For Oily/Acne-Prone Skin

Morning:

1. Gentle foaming cleanser with tea tree
2. Alcohol-free witch hazel toner
3. Lightweight hyaluronic acid serum
4. Oil-free aloe moisturizer
5. Mineral sunscreen

Evening:

1. Oil cleanse with jojoba
2. Foaming cleanser
3. Salicylic acid treatment (2-3x weekly)
4. Niacinamide serum
5. Lightweight gel moisturizer

# For Dry/Mature Skin

Morning:

1. Cream cleanser
2. Rose water toner
3. Vitamin C serum
4. Rich moisturizer with plant butters
5. Mineral sunscreen

Evening:

1. Oil cleanse with avocado or olive oil
2. Gentle cream cleanser
3. AHA treatment (2x weekly)
4. Peptide or bakuchiol serum
5. Facial oil (rosehip or argan)
6. Rich night cream

# For Sensitive Skin

Morning:

1. Micellar water or gentle milk cleanser
2. Chamomile or aloe toner
3. Centella asiatica (cica) serum
4. Fragrance-free moisturizer with oat extract
5. Mineral sunscreen with zinc oxide

Evening:

1. Oil cleanse with sunflower oil
2. Gentle milk cleanser
3. Fragrance-free hydrating serum
4. Barrier-supporting moisturizer
5. Thin layer of healing ointment if needed

# Final Thoughts: Consistency Over Perfection

The best skincare routine is the one you'll actually do consistently. Five simple steps you complete every day will give better results than a complicated 12-step routine you only manage once a week when you're not exhausted.

Remember that healthy skin is a marathon, not a sprint. Those ""miracle"" overnight solutions? Usually just clever marketing or temporary effects. Real, lasting skin health comes from consistent care, a good diet, plenty of water, adequate sleep, and stress management.

And hey, if you miss a night or fall asleep with your makeup on occasionally? The skin police won't come for you. Just get back on track the next day.

Your skin is as unique as you are. The most natural skincare approach of all is learning to listen to what it needs and responding with kindness. After all, you'll be wearing this face for a long time - might as well take good care of it!

If you don't know, Cuffu Bar is a Scrub Soap with natural coffee grounds. It claims to exfoliate, brighten, moisturize, lift, and firm skin. It also claims to whiten skin and gently removes visible wrinkles.

On my initial use, talagang nakaka baby skin agad agad after maligo. Legit yung sinasabi nilang parang butt ng baby. I've tried different kinds of soap or scrub already pero by far dito ko lang naexperience yung ganitong sobrang lambot.

If you're a coffee lover, magugustuhan mo talaga eto. Amoy siyang dunkin IMO.

This is a scrub soap so hindi siya for everyday use. Once or twice a week lang siya gamitin or puwede rin naman every other day. Sa case ko, I use it twice a week during my 'everything shower'.

I saw a post claiming na instant whitening, for me NO. I think it brightens the skin rather than whitens it.

Disclaimer lang na manilis ito matunaw so I suggest na after gamitin, lagay ulit sa plastic packaging and sa box.

New Year, New Adventures: Unearthing the Best New Year Vacation Deals
---------------------------------------------------------------------

So, the big question looming, isn't it? Where do you even *start* looking for those elusive new year vacation deals? The idea of a New Year's getaway is thrilling, but the thought of navigating countless travel websites and comparing prices till your eyes cross? Not so much. It can feel like trying to find a needle in a haystack, right? Especially when everyone else is probably thinking the same thing about escaping for the holiday. But fear not, intrepid traveler! We've got you covered. We're going to delve into the nitty-gritty of scoring some seriously attractive deals that won't leave your wallet weeping. Because ringing in the New Year in style shouldn't break the bank. It’s all about being savvy, knowing where to look, and maybe, just maybe, being a little flexible. Think of it as a treasure hunt, and we're providing the map.

### Decoding the Discount Game: Understanding How to Find Those Sweet Spots

Okay, let's pull back the curtain a little on the world of travel deals. It's not just random luck that you stumble upon a killer price. Travel providers – think airlines, hotels, cruise lines – they're all running businesses, and they need to fill those seats, those rooms, those cabins! So, they often release special offers and packages, especially during times when demand might be slightly lower, or they're trying to attract a different kind of traveler. Peak holiday times, like New Year's, *can* be pricier, no doubt. But that doesn't mean deals don't exist. They absolutely do! You just need to understand the rhythm of the travel industry and know when and where to pounce. It's like knowing when the bakery puts out its fresh batch of croissants – timing is everything!

One key to unlocking these deals is flexibility. Can you travel a day or two before or after the absolute peak? Sometimes shifting your dates by even a few days can make a significant difference in price. Are you tied to a specific destination, or are you open to exploring a few different options? Being open-minded can open up a whole new world of possibilities, and often, better prices. Also, consider package deals. Sometimes bundling your flight and hotel can be surprisingly cost-effective compared to booking them separately. And don't underestimate the power of signing up for newsletters and following your favorite travel companies on social media. They often announce flash sales and exclusive offers to their loyal followers.

#### Timing is Everything (Almost!): When to Pounce on New Year Vacation Deals

Let's talk strategy. When's the best time to start looking for those juicy new year vacation deals? While last-minute deals do pop up sometimes, it's generally a bit of a gamble, especially for a popular holiday like New Year's. Demand is high, and waiting too long can mean limited options and inflated prices. Think of it like waiting for the last slice of pizza at a party – someone else is probably eyeing it too! The sweet spot for booking seems to be a few months out. This gives you a good balance of options and time for prices to fluctuate. However, if you're feeling adventurous and have some wiggle room in your schedule and destination, last-minute can *sometimes* yield some unexpected gems. But for peace of mind and the widest selection, planning ahead is usually the way to go. Keep an eye out for early bird discounts, which are often released well in advance to incentivize booking.

- Aim for a sweet spot a few months before your preferred New Year's date.
- Be open to flexible travel dates; flying on a Tuesday instead of a Friday can often save you a pretty penny.
- Sign up for airline and hotel newsletters – they often announce exclusive deals to their subscribers.
- Don't be afraid to explore package deals – bundling can save you money.

#### Beyond the Airlines: Hidden Gems in Accommodation and Activities

Okay, you've got your eye on a flight deal, or maybe you've found a killer price on transportation. But what about where you'll rest your weary head? And what about the fun stuff you're going to *do*? Accommodation and activities can sometimes feel like afterthoughts when you're fixated on the flight price, but they can significantly impact your overall budget and, frankly, your enjoyment of the trip. New Year vacation deals aren't just about flights! Hotels often have special New Year's Eve packages that include dinner, entertainment, and of course, a bubbly toast at midnight. Looking for something a little different? Consider things like rental properties through sites like Airbnb or Vrbo. These can be great options for families or groups, offering more space and a kitchen, which can save you money on dining out. And don’t forget about hostels or guesthouses if you’re on a tighter budget or looking for a more social experience.

As for activities, research what's happening in your chosen destination around New Year's. Are there free fireworks displays? Public concerts? Book tours and excursions in advance, especially if they're popular, as they can sell out quickly. Many tour operators and activity providers offer discounts for booking online or in advance. And remember, not every fun activity has to cost a fortune. Exploring local  
parks, visiting museums on free admission days (check their websites!), or simply wandering through charming neighborhoods can be incredibly enjoyable and budget-friendly.

### Cast a Wide Net: Exploring Different Destination Options

So, you've decided you're whisking yourself away for New Year's. Excellent! Now, where to? The world is your oyster, as they say! But let’s be real, some destinations will offer better new year vacation deals than others. Thinking outside the box can seriously pay off. Instead of the super-hyped, mega-expensive spots, consider places that might be slightly less obvious but still offer incredible experiences. Maybe it's a charming European city that celebrates with beautiful light displays but isn't quite as packed (and pricey) as Paris or London. Or perhaps it's a beach destination in a less-trafficked region that offers stunning scenery and a relaxed vibe without the hefty price tag of a major resort area.

Consider your priorities. Are you craving sunshine and warmth? Or are you dreaming of a snowy wonderland? Are you looking for a vibrant city experience with tons of nightlife, or a quiet, nature-focused retreat? Knowing what kind of experience you're after will help narrow down your options and ultimately lead you to the destinations where you're most likely to find deals that align with your desires and your budget. Don't be afraid to do a little digging and explore less conventional options. Sometimes the best experiences are found off the beaten path.

#### Sunshine and Sipping: Ringing in the New Year on a Tropical Beach

Ah, the allure of a beach New Year's! Swapping winter coats for swimsuits as you countdown to midnight with your toes in the sand? Pure bliss, right? If sunshine and relaxation are high on your list, there are definitely some fantastic beach destinations that offer great new year vacation deals. Think beyond the super-popular Caribbean islands (which can be pricey during peak season) and consider places like Mexico's Pacific coast, parts of Central America, or even Southeast Asia if you're up for a longer flight. These regions often offer beautiful beaches, fantastic food, and a vibrant atmosphere without the eye-watering costs of some of the more well-known spots. Look for package deals that include flights, accommodation, and maybe even some meals or activities. Sometimes resorts will offer special New Year's Eve gala dinners or entertainment as part of their packages. Just make sure to read the fine print to see what's included!

- **Mexico:** Consider parts of the Pacific coast like Puerto Vallarta or Riviera Nayarit.
- **Central America:** Look into destinations like Costa Rica or Belize for beautiful beaches and eco-adventures.
- **Southeast Asia:** If you're ready for a longer journey, Thailand or Vietnam can offer stunning beaches and incredibly affordable delicious food.

#### Cozy and Chic: Celebrating in a Charming Winter Wonderland

Maybe your New Year's fantasy involves snowflakes, hot cocoa, and the cozy glow of a fireplace. If a winter wonderland is calling your name, there are some truly magical destinations to consider. Think charming European towns adorned with festive lights, snowy mountain resorts, or even national parks that transform into winter playgrounds. While ski resorts can be expensive, especially during peak season, you might find deals on accommodation if you're not planning on hitting the slopes every single day. Consider charming smaller towns near popular ski areas – they often offer a more relaxed vibe and potentially more affordable lodging. Looking for something truly unique? Maybe a trip to Iceland to chase the Northern Lights or explore stunning frozen landscapes? While not typically a budget destination, sometimes package deals that combine flights, tours, and accommodation can make it more accessible.

Don't forget about North American options either! Charming towns in places like Vermont, Colorado, or the Canadian Rockies offer beautiful winter scenery and festive New Year's celebrations. And if you're open to a city break during the winter, think about cities known for their festive markets and beautiful holiday decorations. They might offer a different kind of winter charm without the need for ski gear.

- **European Charms:** Explore cities like Prague, Vienna, or Budapest for festive markets and beautiful architecture.
- **North American Wonders:** Consider places like Asheville, NC, or Banff, Canada, for a mix of outdoor beauty and cozy charm.
- **The Unexpected:** Iceland offers a unique winter experience, and sometimes package deals make it a possibility.

Unlocking Even More: Nabbing Those Extra Perks and Savings
----------------------------------------------------------

Finding a basic deal is great, right? But what about those little extras that really elevate your trip and save you even more dough? We're talking about lounge access, free breakfast, maybe even a room upgrade? These things can seriously enhance your travel experience and make your new year vacation deals even sweeter. It’s like finding a twenty-dollar bill in a jacket you haven’t worn in ages – a pleasant surprise that just makes things a little bit better! So, how do you go about snagging these additional perks?

It often comes down to loyalty programs, credit card benefits, and knowing when and how to ask. Are you a member of any airline or hotel loyalty programs? If not, signing up is usually free and can start earning you points or miles that can be redeemed for upgrades, free stays, or other perks down the line. Do you have travel-focused credit cards? Many offer benefits like travel insurance, lounge access, or even statement credits for travel purchases. Knowing the benefits of your cards *before* you book can save you significant money and headaches.

### Leverage Your Connections: Loyalty Programs and Travel Credit Cards

Your loyalty can seriously pay off in the travel world. Airlines and hotels *want* you to book with them repeatedly, and they often reward loyal customers with exclusive benefits and special offers. If you're planning a New Year's trip, now's a great time to sign up for the loyalty programs of the airlines and hotels you're considering. Even if you don't have elite status yet, being a member can sometimes give you access to member-only rates or early bird booking opportunities. And think about consolidating your spending with one or two major travel providers or credit cards. Accumulating points or miles faster can help you reach those coveted statuses or redeem for valuable rewards sooner. It's a bit like accumulating points at your favorite coffee shop – the more you go, the closer you are to a free drink!

- **Sign Up:** Enroll in loyalty programs for your preferred airlines and hotels.
- **Consolidate:** Focus your travel spending on cards or programs that offer the best rewards.
- **Know Your Benefits:** Understand what your credit cards offer in terms of travel perks.

### The Art of the Ask: Don't Be Afraid to politely request upgrades or extras

This might sound a little old-fashioned, but sometimes, simply asking nicely can yield surprising results. At hotel check-in, a polite inquiry about the possibility of a room upgrade *can* sometimes lead to a better room, especially if the hotel isn't fully booked. It doesn't hurt to ask! The worst they can say is no. Similarly, if you're celebrating a special occasion during your New Year's trip (like, you know, the *actual* New Year!), mentioning it when you book or check-in might sometimes result in a small perk, like a complimentary drink or a dessert. Hospitality staff often want to make your stay special, and letting them know about your celebration can give them the opportunity to do so. Of course, this isn't guaranteed, and it's important to be polite and understanding if an upgrade or special treat isn't possible. But a little bit of charm and a genuine smile can go a long way!

#### Going Incognito: The ""Private Browsing"" Myth (and what actually works)

You've probably heard the tip about using private or incognito browsing windows when searching for flights, right? The idea is that travel websites hike up prices if they see you searching for the same routes repeatedly. While this *used* to be a bit more of a thing, with modern website tracking and cookies, the impact of private browsing on flight prices is often minimal or non-existent. It’s not the magical money-saving trick it’s sometimes made out to be.

Instead of focusing on incognito mode, concentrate on the strategies that *actually* work. This includes being flexible with dates and times, comparing prices across multiple booking sites (not just relying on one), setting price alerts, and considering flying into or out of alternate, smaller airports near your destination. These practical steps are far more likely to yield actual savings than simply opening a private browser window. It's about smart searching, not hiding from the internet!

Staying Savvy on the Go: Tips for a Smooth and Budget-Friendly New Year's Trip
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, you've snagged some killer new year vacation deals and your trip is booked. Fantastic! But the savvy savings shouldn't stop there, should they? Once you're on your trip, there are still plenty of ways to keep your budget in check and ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience. After all, you don't want to blow all the money you saved on your deals by overspending while you're there! It's about being mindful and making smart choices on the ground. Think of it as continuing the treasure hunt – now you're looking for ways to maximize your enjoyment without draining your resources.

### Navigating with Grace: Transportation Hacks in a New City

Getting around in a new place *can* add up quickly. Taxis can be expensive, especially in touristy areas, and navigating public transportation can sometimes feel daunting in an unfamiliar city. But there are definitely ways to get around efficiently and affordably. Research the public transportation options in your destination *before* you arrive. Are there multi-day passes that offer unlimited rides for a set price? Are there specific apps that are best for planning routes? Often, public transport is a fantastic way to see the city and get a feel for daily life, all while saving money.

Consider walking! Not only is it free, but it’s also a great way to discover hidden gems and get some exercise. Pack comfortable shoes and be prepared to explore on foot when possible. Ride-sharing apps can be convenient, but compare prices with taxis to see which is more cost-effective, especially during peak times or surge pricing. And if you're planning on doing a lot of sightseeing that's spread out, look into hop-on hop-off bus tours. While not the cheapest option, they *can* be a cost-effective way to see multiple attractions without having to worry about navigating public transport or paying for taxis between each stop.

- **Research Public Transport:** Look into passes and helpful apps before you arrive.
- **Embrace Walking:** It's free, healthy, and a great way to explore.
- **Compare Ride Options:** Don't automatically default to taxis; consider ride-sharing or public transport first.

### Dining Delights (Without the Hefty Price Tag): Eating Like a Local

Food is a huge part of the travel experience, isn't it? Trying local delicacies, discovering new flavors – it's all part of the fun. But dining out for every meal can seriously impact your budget, especially in popular tourist areas. So, how do you enjoy the culinary scene without spending a fortune? Eat like a local! Seek out local markets, street food vendors, and smaller, more casual restaurants where the locals eat. Not only will you likely find more authentic and delicious food, but it will also be significantly cheaper than dining in tourist traps.

Consider having breakfast at your accommodation if it's included, or pick up some groceries and make your own simple breakfasts or lunches. This can save you a considerable amount of money over the course of your trip. And don't be afraid to try a ""plat du jour"" or fixed-price menu at restaurants – they often offer great value for money. Portion sizes can also be huge in some places, so consider sharing meals, especially if you're traveling with companions. And if you're really on a tight budget, picnics in parks or by the water can be a lovely and affordable way to enjoy a meal with a view.

#### Free Fun is the Best Fun: Discovering Budget-Friendly Activities

You don't need to spend a fortune to have an amazing time on your New Year's getaway. Many cities and destinations offer fantastic free or low-cost activities that are just as enjoyable, if not more so, than expensive paid attractions. Look for free walking tours – they're a great way to get introduced to a city, learn about its history, and get insider tips from a local guide. Visit free museums (many major cities have them!), explore public parks and gardens, or simply wander through charming neighborhoods and soak up the atmosphere.

Check local event listings closer to your travel dates. There might be free concerts, festivals, or art exhibitions happening around the New Year. Fireworks displays are often a free and spectacular way to ring in the New Year, and finding a good viewing spot can be an experience in itself. Don't underestimate the simple pleasure of people-watching in a bustling square or enjoying the natural beauty of your surroundings. Sometimes the best experiences are the ones that don't cost a dime!

- **Free Walking Tours:** A fantastic introduction to a city and its history.
- **Free Museums and Parks:** Many offer free admission or beautiful spaces to explore.
- **Check Local Event Listings:** Discover free concerts, festivals, or exhibitions.

Planning for Peace of Mind: Insurance, Safety, and Staying Informed
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You've scored great new year vacation deals, planned your itinerary, and you're ready to go! But before you head off on your adventure, there are a few important things to consider to ensure a smooth, safe, and stress-free trip. Because unforeseen things can happen, right? Luggage can get lost, flights can be delayed, and unfortunately, sometimes illness or injury can occur while you’re away from home. Being prepared for these possibilities won't detract from your fun; it will actually ensure that if something does go wrong, you're covered and can handle it without undue stress or financial burden. Think of it as adding another layer of security to your carefully planned adventure.

### Protecting Your Investment: The Importance of Travel Insurance

This is a big one, folks. Travel insurance might seem like an unnecessary expense when you're trying to save money, but believe me, it's absolutely worth it. Think of it as an umbrella for your trip – you hope you don't need it, but if it starts pouring rain, you'll be incredibly glad you have it! Travel insurance can cover things like trip cancellation or interruption (if something prevents you from going or forces you to come home early), lost or delayed luggage, medical emergencies, and even emergency evacuation.

Read the policy details carefully to understand what is and isn't covered. Make sure it includes coverage for medical emergencies, as getting sick or injured in a foreign country can be incredibly expensive without insurance. Compare policies from different providers to find the one that best suits your needs and your trip. It’s a small investment that can save you from a huge financial headache down the line. Don't skimp on this!

#### Staying Safe and Aware: Tips for a Secure Trip

Your safety is paramount. While most travel destinations are safe, it's always important to be aware of your surroundings and take precautions, just as you would at home. Do some research on the areas you'll be visiting. Are there any neighborhoods to avoid, especially at night? Be mindful of your belongings, particularly in crowded places. Don't flash expensive jewelry or electronics. Use common sense – if something feels off, it probably is.

Keep your valuables secure, perhaps in a money belt or a hotel safe. Make copies of important documents like your passport and keep them separate from the originals. Share your itinerary with a trusted friend or family member back home. And be aware of local customs and etiquette. Being respectful of the local culture can go a long way in ensuring a positive experience and avoiding any misunderstandings. Staying informed and being aware are your best defenses against potential problems.

**Why This Pick?**

The Angels have won the first two games in this series, friends. Not only do I think that the Dodgers will avoid getting  swept, but I just don’t trust Yusei Kikuchi (3.72 ERA) to keep it close. Kikuchi is 0-4 with the Angels this season, and 3 of his logged 4 losses have been by more than 2 runs. On the other side, the home team will start Tony Gonsolin (2.81 ERA) who’s 2-0 so far this season, and both of his logged wins have been by at least 5 runs. Give me the Dodgers to avoid the sweep and cover the RL.

1kpdwx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoolNewGadgets/comments/1kpdwx0/portable_mobile_wifi_devices_my_experience_using/,Portable Mobile WiFi Devices: My Experience Using Ryoko WiFi On the Road and at Home,"I’ve always relied on public WiFi or my phone's hotspot whenever I’m out working remotely or traveling, but after a few too many frustrating experiences with weak connections, I decided to try a portable mobile WiFi device. After reading a bunch of threads and comparisons, I ended up testing out the **MUAMA Ryoko WiFi**, and I’ve been using it regularly for the past few months.

This post isn’t some promo or sales pitch. I just wanted to share my experience using **Ryoko WiFi** in real life: what’s good, what’s not, and who it might actually work for.

**Why I Needed a Portable WiFi Device**

I work remotely and like to stay flexible about where I get things done. That means hopping between coffee shops, libraries, parks, Airbnbs, and sometimes even my car if I need a quiet place to focus. The problem is, public WiFi is often unreliable or painfully slow. I’ve had Zoom calls drop, file uploads fail, and more than a few instances of connecting to unsecured networks I didn’t really trust.

I used to tether from my phone, but that drained my battery and burned through my data plan. That’s when I started looking into **portable mobile WiFi devices** that run on their own data and work like a personal hotspot without depending on your phone.

**What is MUAMA Ryoko WiFi?**

The **Ryoko WiFi device** is a small 4G LTE hotspot that lets you create a secure internet connection pretty much anywhere there’s cell service. It works in **76 countries**, and you can connect up to **eight devices** at the same time, which is useful if you’re traveling with others or using a laptop, phone, and tablet like I do.

What caught my attention was that **Ryoko WiFi doesn't require a contract**, and you’re not locked into any monthly plan. You just load data as needed, and that’s it. That flexibility was a big plus for me.

I ordered mine from here:  
[**MUAMA Ryoko WiFi Official Page**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets)

**Setup and First Impressions**

Setup was super simple. The device came with a SIM card already installed and **500MB of free data** to try it out. I turned it on, scanned the QR code with my phone, and was online in under a minute. It doesn’t require any special app or tech knowledge. The interface is browser-based, and you can access all settings from there.

**Ryoko WiFi Performance: Speed and Connection**

I’ve used the **Ryoko portable WiFi** in a variety of places: in the city, rural areas, on the road, and even during a short camping trip. In most locations with decent 4G coverage, I was getting download speeds between **40 to 90 Mbps**, which is enough for streaming, video calls, and uploading large files.

There were some drops in speed in remote areas, but the signal remained stable enough for basic tasks like email and browsing. What really surprised me was that I could even stream Netflix from my laptop while parked at a rest stop.

Battery life has been consistently good. I get about **12 to 15 hours per charge**, and it uses USB-C, so I charge it with the same cable I use for my phone.

**Data Top-Ups and Cost**

After the trial data ran out, I bought a 10GB top-up. Data is sold on a **pay-as-you-go basis**, starting from $5 for 1GB. Larger packages like 10GB or 20GB offer better rates per GB. The key thing is that **your data doesn't expire each month**. If you only use part of a bundle, the rest remains until you need it.

You can buy data directly here:  
[**Ryoko WiFi Data Bundles**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?uid=4362&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets)

This was great for me because I don’t need it every single day, and I hate paying for stuff I’m not using.

**What I Like About Ryoko WiFi**

* Works in over 70 countries
* Doesn’t need a phone or carrier
* Good speed and reliability for most tasks
* Battery lasts all day
* Setup takes less than 5 minutes
* No forced subscription

**Limitations to Consider**

* It’s 4G LTE, not 5G
* No digital screen on the device (you check usage via browser)
* The SIM that comes with it is locked to the Ryoko unit (but you can use a different SIM if needed)

**Is Ryoko WiFi Right for You?**

If you’re looking for **portable mobile WiFi** that gives you freedom without committing to a carrier or monthly fee, **MUAMA Ryoko WiFi** is a solid option. I’ve used it for travel, remote work, and even as a backup at home when my main internet was down.

It’s not a replacement for a full home connection, but for staying connected when you’re away from home, it does the job. Especially if you’re someone who wants control over when and how you use your data.

Let me know if you’re using Ryoko or another portable WiFi setup. I’d be curious to hear what works for others.",1,1747551456.0,CoolNewGadgets,0,1.0,False

# 💡 What Makes Coffee Healthy?

Coffee contains **caffeine**, **polyphenols**, and a range of **antioxidants**. These compounds help neutralize free radicals, reduce inflammation, and support metabolic processes. According to the **Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health**, regular coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of several chronic diseases, including diabetes and heart disease.

 

# 👩‍⚕️ Expert Insight: What Do Coffee Professionals Say?

We reached out to several coffee experts, nutritionists, and baristas to get their take on the health benefits of coffee:

# Dr. Liana Freeman, Nutritionist & Coffee Researcher:

""Coffee, when consumed moderately (2–4 cups per day), can be an excellent source of antioxidants. It’s the leading source of polyphenols in the Western diet. It not only improves alertness but also offers neuroprotective benefits.""

# Ethan Grillo, Specialty Coffee Roaster & Barista Trainer:

""I’ve spent over 12 years in the specialty coffee industry, and the evolution of coffee from a pick-me-up drink to a health-forward beverage is astonishing. We now see people switching to organic, low-acid, and mushroom coffee blends for better gut health and mental clarity.""

 

# 🙋‍♂️ Real User Experience: What Our Community Says

We asked readers of [**GoMehedi.com**](https://gomehedi.com/) and coffee lovers from our Instagram and Pinterest communities to share how coffee has impacted their lives. Here are a few stories:

# ✨ Samantha, 38, California:

""I started drinking black coffee every morning to cut out sugary drinks. Over time, I noticed not only weight loss but improved focus and less brain fog.""

# ✨ James, 45, New York:

""As someone with type 2 diabetes, my nutritionist actually recommended moderate coffee intake. It helps with insulin sensitivity, and I’ve seen real progress in my blood sugar levels.""

# ✨ Rina, 29, from Tokyo:

""I switched to mushroom coffee after reading on GoMehedi. Now I feel energized without the jitters. It’s like brain fuel for my productivity!""

 

# 🧠 Brain Benefits: Cognitive Protection You Can Sip

Several studies suggest that regular coffee consumption may protect the brain from age-related decline. Caffeine helps:

·         Improve memory

·         Enhance reaction time

·         Reduce the risk of **Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases**

The **Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease** even published findings that coffee drinkers had a significantly lower risk of developing dementia.

 

# 💖 Coffee & Heart Health: A Balanced Brew for a Healthy Heart

According to the **American Heart Association**, moderate coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of heart failure. The antioxidants in coffee help reduce arterial inflammation and improve blood vessel function.

🔍 **Fact**: People who drink 3–5 cups of coffee per day have a **15% lower risk of cardiovascular disease** compared to non-drinkers.

 

# 🏃‍♀️ Boosts Physical Performance & Fat Burning

Caffeine stimulates the nervous system, signaling fat cells to break down body fat. It also increases **epinephrine** levels, prepping the body for physical exertion. That’s why coffee is often consumed before workouts.

📌 **Pro Tip from GoMehedi**: Try sipping a cup of **black coffee 30 minutes before exercise** to boost endurance and fat oxidation.

 

# 🩸 Blood Sugar Balance & Diabetes Protection

Numerous studies show that coffee drinkers have a **23–50% lower risk** of developing type 2 diabetes. Chlorogenic acid, a major antioxidant in coffee, is believed to slow glucose absorption and improve insulin sensitivity.

# 🧘 Mental Health & Mood Enhancer

Caffeine increases dopamine production, improving mood and motivation. Studies published in the **Archives of Internal Medicine** found that women who drank coffee had a **20% lower risk of depression**.

🗣️ **User Voice – Mark, 52**:

""After going through a tough phase, I found solace in my coffee routine. It gave me structure, and somehow that familiar aroma in the morning made a big emotional difference.""

 

# 🌿 Antioxidant Powerhouse

Believe it or not, **coffee is the #1 source of antioxidants** in many people's diets — even beating out fruits and vegetables in some cases!

Antioxidants in coffee include:

·         **Hydroxycinnamic acids**

·         **Polyphenols**

·         **Cafestol & Kahweol** (anti-inflammatory compounds)

 

# ☠️ Coffee May Help You Live Longer

A massive **meta-analysis** in the *European Journal of Epidemiology* found that coffee drinkers had a **10–15% lower risk of all-cause mortality**. This means you’re more likely to live longer when you regularly sip your favorite brew — especially black or lightly sweetened.

 

# 🛑 Is There a Catch? Understanding the Limit

While coffee is packed with benefits, overconsumption (more than 5–6 cups daily) can cause:

·         Insomnia

·         Digestive issues

·         Increased heart rate

·         Dependency

💡 **Recommendation**: Stick to **2–4 cups per day**, and opt for **quality coffee beans** or **low-acid options** featured on [**GoMehedi.com**](https://gomehedi.com/).

But maybe, just maybe, the solitude is prepping me for something more... like a quiet before the upcoming laughter. Who knows, right? Just trying to stay hopeful amidst the stillness. 🌿",1,1747550491.0,LonelyReflections,0,1.0,False

Name: miko Inaba.   Mi-(beauty) ko-(child) miko-(beautiful child) in-(cause/reason) ba-(banner) inaba-(banner of cause)

Age: 17

Year: 2nd

Grade: grade 1

Height: 5'4

Appearance: Miko is a petite girl with short, black hair. She has a slim build but little to no muscles. Most of her power comes from a high cursed energy output. She wears her uniform properly when she is excorzing curses. Outside of work, she wears casual wear mostly baggy hoodies and jeans.

Personality: Miko is a reserved, soft-spoken, and private person who struggles with social interactions and embarrasses easily. Though she has few friends, she is warm-hearted, emotionally sensitive, and deeply caring. Diligent and responsible, she excels in her studies and enjoys spending her free time reading mystery novels and playing video games. She values solitude and often dedicates time to studying or her personal hobbies. She loves coffee, visiting her favorite cafe rach day before going to jujutsu high. Miko is a very dedicated Sorcerer, one of the best in the modern era other than gojo satoru, kenjaku and ryomen sukuna. Miko was taught how to lie by aoi todo who was her teacher. Miko grew a bit detached without her friends, because the higher ups found her best when they needed a defective Sorcerer or curse user to die. Despite her technique, Miko does not believe in karma.

Base technique: karmic retribution.

Miko calls the base technique ""prarabdha"" which is karma being collected in one moment. This technique is first activated once miko snaps her fingers. This enters miko into a counter state that lasts 2.5 seconds. If she is attacked during this period, the attacker has their attack reflected into the same spot for equal damage. Miko is invulnerable during this period. The damage that is reflected is not the damage dealt to miko, but the damage that would have occurred if they hit themselves with their own attack. During this period, she cannot attack anything without the counter. This technique has a 31 second cooldown. (31 planes of existence in buddism). 

Binding vow: No mercy, No shield

This binding vow removes the seconds of invulnerability, in return for miko doing extra damage when she counters.

Extentions: 

Sanchita (past karma): this delays the counter hitting an attacker for 1.2 seconds, allowing miko to attack before the counter hits.

Agami (current actions that cause karma to be collected later): this redirect the counter to another target. Used best against multiple enemies.

Reversal, good karma: This reversal instead of countering an attack, it increases miko's cursed energy output for 5 seconds. It increases more depending on the strength of the attack.

[Hollow technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/CTsandbox/s/r3UCtnE8S3) (hollows are way easier in her world) madhyama pratipad: this technique uses up almost all of her Cursed energy to use. She snaps both fingers, activating the counter state. In this counter state, if she is attacked the attacker will be hit by their attack three times over at 2.5 base strength.

Cursed tools: 

""Moment of clarity"" is a necklace with beads on it that glow red. Once per fight these beads can restore her cooldown

""Karma's echo"" is a dagger with three stars on it. Once somebody is cut by the dagger they become marked. If a marked target attacks miko both will get hit at the same time. The counter is weaker than if miko snapped. Karma's echo has three charges.

I know it sounds silly, but stepping out of my comfort zone and trying a new coffee kinda feels like climbing a small mountain. I usually get a vanilla latte every time—it’s safe, predictable, and, well... delicious. 

But I’ve been trying to shake things up a bit and push myself with little changes. So I went for the caramel macchiato, and let me tell you, my heart was legit racing while I waited. I kept thinking, ""What if I hate it? What if I’m wasting my money on something I can’t even finish?"" Yeah, maybe a bit dramatic, but that's anxiety for ya, I guess.

Turns out, I loved it! 😊 It was a total win. But it got me wondering, how do you guys deal with that nagging fear of trying something different, especially with small things like this? I’d love to hear any tips or stories on how you manage those tricky little fears and push past them. Cheers to more caramel adventures, right?",1,1747550253.0,ComfortZoneChronicles,0,1.0,False

My ex was always generally pretty awful to me. My friends couldn’t stand him. He allowed everyone in his life to verbally abuse me for years. He always acted like I was nothing and because he had money and I didn’t he really pressed that in. We have a kid together and he has no interest in quitting his drug habits, meanwhile I am sober. 

All of this has taken place in a short few months. But I need somewhere to shout from the rooftops, I met the most incredible human. He is kind, and mellow, and thoughtful, and everything I didn’t think I would ever find let alone deserve. He has babies (I’ve always wanted more but never want to be pregnant again) and is very involved in their lives. He does everything he can to respect me and my boundaries, he does all of the little things and the big ones. It’s been a very short period of time but I know he’s the one. I cannot believe that this is what I’ve been missing out on. All it took was finding my self respect and self love and he just waltzed right in. He is transparent and honest, and I trust him and his word which is also incredibly rare for me. He reminds me of my friends who I have known most of my life. I pray to god I can be enough, and that I can be as good to him as he’s been to me. I have never felt this way about anyone, he makes me feel nervous like I’m a teenager again. He makes me feel safe, and respected, and loved (even though we haven’t said the “L” word yet). He already knows so much of my lore including my addiction and trauma and sees me through the bullshit. I feel like he draws out the very best in me just by existing. I hope I am lucky enough to grow old with him. Is this really what people in love feel like? I can’t get enough, I love how he smells, I love how he looks and who he is. I cannot find a single thing I don’t love about him. He opens the car door for me every SINGLE time I get into it, not just once to be impressive. He turns my coffee on before waking me up, he works hard. Honestly I could go on for an eternity about how much I love him. Thank you Reddit for being an ear, because I truly don’t have anywhere to say this yet.

Havenwood, Oregon. Population: blissfully unaware. That was the town motto, stitched onto the welcome sign next to a picture of a suspiciously round beaver. To outsiders, it was your quintessential Pacific Northwest hamlet – misty mornings, lumberjack beards, and an abundance of artisanal coffee shops. But for the kids of Havenwood, there was a secret whispered only in hushed tones and wide-eyed glances: Moon Night.

Every nine years, like clockwork designed by a cosmic prankster, gravity took a vacation. Just in Havenwood. One single, glorious night of zero-G shenanigans that the grown-ups conveniently forgot ever happened. They’d mumble about strange dreams or blame the local microbrews, but the kids? They knew. They hoarded flashlights and glow sticks, planned elaborate floating games, and counted down the days with feverish anticipation.

Tonight was the night. A palpable buzz of excitement thrummed beneath the surface of the seemingly ordinary evening. Streetlights cast long, static shadows, the air hung still and expectant, like the world holding its breath before a spectacular magic trick.

Jace Ellison, all gangly limbs and a mop of perpetually messy brown hair, bounced on the balls of his sneakers, practically vibrating with impatience. Seventeen years old and convinced he was born with a healthy disregard for rules, Moon Night was his personal Super Bowl. Tonight, the sky wasn't the limit – it was the starting line.

His younger sister, Harper, a meticulously organized sixteen-year-old with a permanent furrow in her brow from worrying about things like ""consequences"" and ""the structural integrity of the universe,"" hovered by the porch swing, fiddling with the strap of her homemade glow-in-the-dark fanny pack. Inside were emergency snacks (astronaut ice cream, naturally), extra batteries, and a meticulously folded map of their usual floating routes.

""Jace, are you sure about this?"" she asked, her voice a tightrope walker balancing between excitement and sheer terror. ""Mom said to be back by eleven, even if… you know.""

Jace grinned, a flash of mischief in his hazel eyes. ""Relax, Harp. Eleven in zero-G feels like five minutes. Besides,"" he winked, pulling out a pair of oversized novelty goggles with spinning LED lights, ""tonight, we’re breaking altitude records!""

Harper sighed, but a small smile tugged at the corner of her lips. Even she couldn't deny the magnetic pull of Moon Night. It was the one night their contrasting personalities found common ground – a shared adventure in a world turned wonderfully upside down.

As the grandfather clock inside their cozy Victorian house chimed midnight, a collective gasp seemed to ripple through the neighborhood. It started subtly, a lightness in the air, a feeling like standing on the precipice of a gentle slope. Then, a ceramic gnome on Mrs. Henderson’s meticulously manicured lawn lifted a few inches, wobbled, and floated serenely upwards.

""It's happening!"" Jace yelled, already launching himself off the porch railing. He whooped as he drifted upwards, his laughter echoing in the suddenly silent street.

Harper took a tentative step, then another, and with a small squeak of surprise, her feet left the ground. A giggle escaped her lips – a rare and precious sound. She floated upwards, her carefully planned route momentarily forgotten in the sheer joy of weightlessness.

The street transformed into an ethereal ballroom. Kids, freed from the tyranny of gravity, twirled and tumbled in the moonlight. Dogs barked in confused delight as they bounced off parked cars. A basketball hoop became a celestial ring toss target. The air shimmered with the soft glow of flashlights and the delighted cries of children experiencing true freedom.

Jace, ever the explorer, propelled himself further than their usual neighborhood circuit. He executed a clumsy somersault, narrowly avoiding a collision with Mr. Abernathy’s inflatable flamingo lawn ornament, which was now enjoying its own aerial adventure.

""Come on, slowpoke!"" he called to Harper, who was still getting the hang of navigating the zero-G currents. She looked like a slightly panicked but undeniably thrilled astronaut on her first spacewalk.

Drawn by the allure of the unknown, Jace drifted towards the edge of town, where the manicured lawns gave way to the dark, looming silhouette of Redwood National Forest. The air here felt different, cooler, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth.

Suddenly, a soft, pulsating luminescence caught his eye. It emanated from a massive oak tree, its ancient branches reaching towards the moon like gnarled fingers. The glow wasn't harsh or electric; it was a gentle, internal light, like a giant firefly had taken up residence in the canopy.

Curiosity, Jace’s constant companion, tugged him forward. He propelled himself through the floating leaves and branches, the air growing warmer as he neared the source of the light. Nestled securely in a fork of the massive branches was a large, teardrop-shaped cocoon. It pulsed with a soft, rhythmic beat, and the light it emitted seemed to shift and swirl within its translucent surface. It felt strangely… alive.

Harper, finally gaining some aerial confidence, noticed her brother drifting towards the woods. A familiar knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach. Jace and ""boundaries"" were not on speaking terms.

""Jace! Where are you going?"" she called out, her voice echoing strangely in the still night air.

Ignoring her, Jace reached out a tentative hand towards the cocoon. It felt smooth and slightly warm to the touch. As his fingers brushed its surface, the pulsating light intensified, and a faint humming sound filled the air.

Just as Harper reached the edge of the woods, her heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs, the cocoon began to subtly shift. A hairline crack appeared on its surface, then another, spiderwebbing outwards. A soft, internal glow intensified, bathing the surrounding branches in an otherworldly light.

Then, with a soft tearing sound, the cocoon split open.

Inside lay a figure unlike anything Jace or Harper had ever seen. It was humanoid in shape but possessed skin that shimmered with a liquid silver, reflecting the moonlight in mesmerizing patterns. Its eyes, large and luminous, blinked slowly, taking in its surroundings with an air of bewildered disorientation.

The silver being stirred, its limbs unfolding with an almost fluid grace. It spoke, but the sounds that emerged were a series of rapid, melodic clicks and whistles, completely foreign to human ears.

""Whoa,"" Jace breathed, his initial shock giving way to stunned fascination.

The silver being seemed to sense their presence. Its large eyes focused on them, widening slightly. It spoke again, this time interspersing its alien tongue with hesitant, broken English. ""Borrowed… moonlight… hiding…""

Suddenly, its gaze darted upwards, its silver skin paling visibly. It clutched a small, intricately carved device in its hand – a device that pulsed with a faint, internal light, mirroring the being's apparent anxiety. The device’s light flickered erratically.

""Cleaners…"" the being whispered, the word laced with palpable fear.

Harper, her initial fear battling with an overwhelming sense of curiosity, floated closer. ""Cleaners? Who are the Cleaners?""

The silver being shook its head, its large eyes filled with a primal terror that transcended language. It pointed a trembling, three-fingered hand upwards, then mimed a swift, destructive motion.

Jace’s protective instincts, usually reserved for Harper’s occasional encounters with particularly aggressive squirrels, flared to life. This being, whatever it was, was clearly scared and vulnerable.

As if on cue, the first hint of dawn began to paint the eastern sky a soft, pearly gray. A collective groan seemed to rise from the floating figures in the town as the invisible force field of Moon Night began to weaken. Slowly, reluctantly, gravity reasserted its dominance.

The gentle floating turned into awkward descents, the laughter replaced by surprised yelps as people’s feet made contact with the ground once more. The magic was fading.

Jace and Harper carefully helped the disoriented silver being down from the tree, its weight surprisingly substantial despite its slender frame. Its silver skin felt cool and smooth beneath their touch.

By the time they reached the relative safety of their backyard, the full weight of gravity had returned. The world felt solid and ordinary again, the night’s magic already receding into the realm of half-forgotten dreams for everyone but them.

Sneaking the silver being, who they tentatively decided to call ""Klem"" based on a sound it frequently made, into their house was a feat of ninja-like precision. Their attic, usually reserved for dusty boxes of old toys and forgotten holiday decorations, became their impromptu sanctuary.

Under the dim glow of a single bare bulb, Klem, still clutching his pulsating device, tried to explain his predicament. His English improved with each hesitant word, often accompanied by elaborate gestures and frustrated sighs when he couldn't find the right term.

He spoke of traveling between ""realms"" using borrowed moonlight as a conduit. The Cleaners, he explained, were entities obsessed with maintaining the ""purity"" of each reality, eradicating anything they deemed chaotic or disruptive. He had, apparently, inadvertently drawn their attention.

His explanations were a bewildering mix of alien physics and desperate pleas. He spoke of timelines and dimensions, of realities that bloomed and withered like cosmic flowers. The siblings listened, their initial awe slowly morphing into a dawning realization of the gravity (pun intended) of the situation.

As Klem finished his fragmented and terrifying tale, a new, far more unsettling phenomenon began to unfold outside their attic window. A series of strange lights appeared in the sky above Havenwood. They weren't the familiar twinkle of stars or the blinking of airplane lights. These were pulsating orbs of intense, otherworldly luminescence, arranged in patterns that defied earthly logic. They moved with a silent, unnerving purpose.

Klem gasped, his silver skin paling to an almost ghostly white. His luminous eyes, wide with terror, were fixed on the alien lights. The device in his hand pulsed rapidly, its light casting frantic shadows on the attic walls.

""They've found me,"" he whispered, his voice barely audible. He turned his gaze to Jace and Harper, his fear now tinged with a desperate urgency. ""And if they've found me here…"" He swallowed hard, his gaze locking onto theirs.

""…they've found you.""

So, there was this girl in front of me who was awkwardly juggling too many things—her keys, a bag, and a pastry. You know, the usual chaos. She drops the pastry (bummer, right?), and this guy behind her picks it up and hands it back to her with a smile.

Now, here's the fun part: instead of just thanking him and moving on, she pulled one of those little almond cookies from her bag and offered it to him. He hesitated for a sec, then accepted it with a bit of a chuckle. Might sound trivial, but it made me think about how this norm of reciprocity plays out even in tiny interactions. Like, why do we sometimes feel that almost knee-jerk need to repay someone's favor, no matter how small?

It's neat how this unspoken rule kinda makes us think on our feet in social settings, sorta like a subconscious dance of giving back—a reminder, maybe, that we're part of a community.

Reed Jackson, a high school history teacher whose life had settled into the comforting rhythm of a grandfather clock with a slightly off-kilter tick, was wrestling with the American Revolution. Not in a historical sense, mind you, but in the far more immediate struggle of deciphering a particularly atrocious essay on the Stamp Act. He sighed, the sound lost in the gentle hum of his ancient desktop computer. His apartment, a monument to organized chaos, was filled with stacks of student papers teetering precariously next to well-loved history books and half-eaten bags of cheddar popcorn.

The next morning, the off-kilter tick of Reed’s life went completely haywire. He woke with a start, a bizarre sense of… emptiness? He reached for the warm, familiar presence beside him, the indentation on the pillow where his wife, Sarah, usually slept. Except… Sarah wasn’t there. And the more he tried to conjure her face, her laugh, the memory of their first awkward dance, the more it slipped through his mental fingers like grains of sand. Panic, cold and sharp, pierced through the fog. His wedding day. He couldn’t remember his wedding day. The vows, the nervous sweat, Sarah’s radiant smile – gone. Vanished.

Then, a thought, unbidden and crystal clear, sliced through his distress. ""Góðan daginn.""

Reed blinked. Did he just… think in Icelandic? He tried again. ""Hvernig hefurðu það?"" It rolled off his tongue with an unnerving fluency, a language he’d never consciously studied, never even considered studying. He scrambled out of bed, knocking over a precarious tower of laundry in his haste, and stared at his reflection. Same slightly rumpled face, same perpetually tired eyes. But the brain behind them felt… different. Like a newly installed app he hadn't downloaded.

Across town, the sunrise was painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, a spectacle entirely lost on Lana Bell. Lana was known at Northwood High for two things: her uncanny ability to disappear into the background and her crippling fear of heights. Field trips to the observation deck? Instant migraine. Even climbing a stepladder to change a lightbulb induced a mild panic attack.

So, when Lana woke up that morning with an inexplicable urge, a pull so strong it felt physical, she was just as disoriented as Reed, albeit in a wildly different way. She found herself staring out her second-story window at the towering skeletal structure of the town’s old water tower, a rusted behemoth that usually sent shivers of dread down her spine. Today, however, it looked… inviting. Challenging.

Before her brain could catch up with the impulse, her legs were carrying her out the door, a half-eaten bowl of cereal abandoned on the kitchen counter. She walked with a newfound confidence, a spring in her step that had never been there before. Reaching the base of the water tower, she didn’t hesitate. The rusty rungs, the dizzying height – none of it registered as fear. Only exhilaration. With a grunt of effort that surprised even herself, Lana began to climb. Higher and higher she went, the wind whipping through her hair, a grin spreading across her face. It felt… fantastic. Like shedding a skin she hadn't even realized she was wearing.

Later that morning, Reed, his mind a whirlwind of forgotten anniversaries and sudden linguistic prowess, tentatively called his best friend, Dave.

“Hey, Dave? You… you remember my wedding, right?” Reed asked, his voice laced with a desperate hope.

Dave chuckled. “Dude, are you okay? Of course, I remember your wedding! Sarah looked like an absolute angel, you were sweating bullets during the vows… classic Reed.”

A wave of relief washed over him, quickly followed by a fresh surge of confusion. If Dave remembered, why couldn’t he? He tried to explain the Icelandic, the gaping hole where his cherished memory should be. Dave, bless his practical heart, suggested everything from sleep deprivation to a rogue batch of gas station sushi. Reed hung up feeling more isolated than ever.

Then, scrolling through his newsfeed during his lunch break (a soggy tuna sandwich he couldn't quite recall packing), he saw it. A local news story with a headline that made his jaw drop: “Strange Phenomenon Sweeps the Nation: People Waking Up With New Skills, Missing Memories.” The article detailed bizarre accounts – a woman in Ohio who suddenly knew how to play the cello but couldn’t remember her childhood pet’s name, a teenager in California fluent in Mandarin but unable to recall his last birthday party. The comments section was a chaotic mix of disbelief, fear, and bewildered personal anecdotes.

Meanwhile, Lana, perched precariously on the platform at the top of the water tower, felt a sense of triumph she’d never experienced. The town spread out beneath her like a miniature diorama. It was… beautiful. As she started her descent, a faint image flickered at the edge of her awareness – a blurry memory of herself as a small child, tears streaming down her face after falling off a swing set, the sharp sting of scraped knees. The memory vanished as quickly as it appeared, leaving behind only a faint echo of discomfort.

Back in his cluttered apartment, Reed was glued to his computer screen, the news articles and online forums a rabbit hole of shared strangeness. He found a forum dedicated to the phenomenon, filled with people swapping stories of lost memories and acquired talents. It was there, amidst the digital chaos, that he saw a post that made his blood run cold.

A user named “Skywatcher77” described waking up with the ability to solve complex algebraic equations but couldn’t remember the name of his favorite ice cream flavor. He also mentioned a fleeting vision just before waking up – “a soft, shimmering light, like a firefly, right in front of my chest.”

Reed’s breath hitched. He remembered that light. A faint, ethereal glow, right before the Icelandic flooded his brain and his wedding day vanished. He frantically scrolled through more posts, searching for similar descriptions. He found a few, scattered amongst the bewildered accounts, each mentioning the same faint, shimmering light.

Then, another post caught his eye. It was from a user with the handle “TowerClimber.” The post was short and simply read: “Woke up this morning and decided to climb the old water tower. No idea why, but the fear is… gone?” Below it were several replies expressing shock and disbelief, as TowerClimber was apparently known in the local online community for their extreme acrophobia.

Reed’s mind raced. A sudden, inexplicable skill… a missing memory… a fleeting light. It couldn’t be a coincidence. He clicked on TowerClimber’s profile, hoping for more information. There wasn’t much, just a generic avatar and a location: Northwood.

Northwood. The same town where he taught. Could TowerClimber be one of his students? A sudden hunch, a gut feeling he couldn't explain, told him it was. He pulled up his student roster, scanning the names. Lana Bell. Quiet, kept to herself… and according to her file, had a documented fear of heights after a childhood incident at a local park.

The pieces clicked into place with a disquieting certainty. He had to find this Lana Bell. He had to know if she had seen the light too.

The next day at Northwood High was a blur of hushed whispers and nervous energy. Students and teachers alike were exchanging bewildered glances, some sporting newfound talents – the usually clumsy janitor was suddenly juggling cleaning supplies with professional flair, the shy librarian was spontaneously bursting into opera during story time. Reed felt like he was living in a bizarre, low-budget sci-fi movie.

He finally spotted Lana sitting alone at a lunch table, sketching something in a notebook with an intense focus he hadn't seen before. He approached her hesitantly.

“Lana? Can I talk to you for a moment?”

Lana looked up, her eyes holding a newfound spark of confidence. “Mr. Jackson? Sure.”

He sat down. “I know this is going to sound strange, but… did anything… unusual happen to you last night?”

Lana’s eyebrows rose slightly. “Unusual? You mean besides the sudden urge to scale a rusty death trap?”

Reed’s heart leaped. “You climbed the water tower?”

“Yeah,” she said, a small, almost defiant smile playing on her lips. “Felt… amazing. Like I could do anything.”

“And before you woke up… did you see anything? A light, maybe?” Reed pressed, his voice tight with anticipation.

Lana frowned, concentrating. “Now that you mention it… yeah. Just for a second. A little shimmer, right in front of me. I thought I was still dreaming.”

A wave of something akin to relief washed over Reed, mixed with a growing sense of unease. They weren’t alone. This wasn’t random.

Over the next few days, Reed and Lana met in secret, comparing their experiences. Lana had lost the vivid memory of a humiliating stage fright incident in middle school but could now solve Rubik’s Cubes in under a minute. Reed, still grappling with the loss of his wedding day, discovered he could now perfectly mimic bird calls. The skills were random, the memory loss deeply personal.

They scoured the internet together, piecing together fragmented accounts, creating a digital map of the “Lantern Effect.” The shimmering light was a consistent detail. The skills gained were diverse and often seemingly useless. The memories lost were always significant to the individual.

“It’s like… something is trading our memories for these random talents,” Lana said one afternoon, tapping furiously on her laptop in the deserted school library. Her usual withdrawn demeanor had been replaced by an almost restless energy.

Reed ran a hand through his already disheveled hair. “But why? What’s the point?”

They tossed around theories – a government experiment gone wrong, some kind of mass psychological phenomenon. But none of them felt right. There was something… else at play. Lana, emboldened by her newfound fearlessness, even suggested alien intervention, a theory Reed initially scoffed at but was starting to reconsider in the face of the inexplicable.

Their breakthrough came late one night, fueled by lukewarm coffee and sheer desperation. Buried deep within an obscure online archive of paranormal phenomena, they found it. A grainy, digitized article from a small-town newspaper in Colorado, dated 1987. The headline was cryptic: “Strange Lights in the Rockies: Locals Report Lost Memories, Sudden Skills.”

The article described eerily similar events – residents waking up with new, unexplainable abilities and a corresponding loss of personal memories. The accounts mentioned faint, glowing lights seen the night before the changes. And the location? A remote, almost mythical town nestled deep within the Rocky Mountains, a place locals whispered about but rarely visited.

Reed and Lana stared at each other, the glow of the computer screen illuminating their faces. A shiver of both fear and excitement ran down their spines.

“The Rockies,” Lana breathed, her eyes wide. “It’s happened before.”

Reed felt a surge of adrenaline, a feeling he hadn’t experienced since his college days. The mundane routine of his life had been shattered, replaced by a mystery that demanded to be solved. He looked at Lana, this once-timid student who now possessed a quiet strength and an unshakeable curiosity.

“We have to go there,” Reed said, a newfound determination hardening his gaze. “We have to find out what’s happening.”

Lana nodded, a thrill of adventure replacing the last vestiges of her former timidity. “Road trip?”

As they began to plan their journey, a faint, almost imperceptible shimmer appeared at the edge of Lana’s vision, near her chest. She blinked, and it was gone. But a strange, unsettling feeling lingered, a sense that the exchange wasn't over, and that their questions might lead them down a path far more dangerous than they could possibly imagine.

1kpdja0,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1kpdja0/maybe_i_cant_hyperfocus/,Maybe I can't hyper-focus?,"Hi, I am an Australian uni student who recently found out one of my friends has inattentive adhd. My previous understanding of it was only hyperactive symptoms that I saw in my friend in high school. So later that night, I went googling adhd instead of going to sleep on time. Slowly I realised just how much of the symptoms I actually had, and since then I have made a gp appointment to kickstart the diagnosis process.

I have been making a list of symptoms with everything from my childhood until now (although it has been 2 weeks, I still haven't finished it). 

One of the symptoms of adhd is hyper-focus. I can recall as a little girl I would love reading books, and I could read for hours and hours on end without realising. So much so, I ended up needing glasses. But as an adult, I can't remember the last time I hyper focused? I can focus on things that I love and grab my attention, for sure. But I still get distracted or bored and leave it instead of focusing on it for hours. 

I sometimes gets spurts of energy to reorganise my apartment, and I would do that for hours if that counts? But it was still interrupted by incoming calls (my family calls me several times a day, and I have to answer because it is either urgent or people get upset when I don't) and doing multiple rooms and things at once. 

Or when it came to end of semester exams, I would study from 10 am to 10 pm (more or less during the 1 week period). But I would still need to get up to pray throughout the day, I felt restlesss sitting down on a chair for so long, and my attention still went in and out, especially with my thoughts. I also had to have music on repeat to get me through it or sometimes I would need silence. I was fuelled by leftovers, protein bars and coffee during that week. 

I do go on googling tangents every other day for anywhere from an hour to three, but then I get bored and stop. 

Let me know if those exams count as hyper-focus or whether it seems like I don't meet the criteria for it.",1,1747549871.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

1kpdhjq,https://thefundraisingauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-best-quick-fundraising-methods_185-1.png,My $1M Fundraising Fiasco,"I still remember the sleepless nights, the endless cups of coffee, and the gut-wrenching anxiety that came with fundraising for my startup. We'd secured angel funding, but needed a significant injection of capital to scale our product. That's when I turned to traditional venture capital firms, but was met with a resounding ""no"".

Undeterred, I dug deeper and discovered alternative fundraising techniques that worked wonders for similar startups in our industry. Here's a case study on how I secured $1M from an unlikely source:

Lessons Learned:

1. **Leverage your network**: Reach out to former colleagues, friends, and family who'd made successful exits or held senior roles in your industry. They may be able to connect you with potential investors or mentors.
2. **Identify niche investors**: Look for specialized investment firms or angel groups focused on your specific industry or geographic region. They often have a deeper understanding of the market and may be more willing to take a risk.
3. **Build a soft landing**: Prepare a robust pitch deck, financial projections, and a detailed business plan. This will help you demonstrate traction and a clear path to profitability.
4. **Seal the deal**: Negotiate a deal that suits both parties. Be prepared to offer equity or convertible notes, and be flexible on valuation.

The outcome: We closed a $1M investment deal in three months, with a significant valuation bump. The investor, a seasoned tech entrepreneur, brought valuable industry insights and a network of connections that helped us scale our product.

Moral of the story: Don't be discouraged by rejections – persistence and creativity can lead to unexpected funding opportunities. Remember to stay adaptable, build strong relationships, and always keep your pitch sharp.",1,1747549676.0,u_OkHuckleberry5258,0,1.0,False

VWAP is a useful tool, no doubt. But layering it with multiple standard deviation bands feels like technical analysis overload. Just because we can add math doesn’t mean it adds value. The video presents the use of VWAP deviations as if they’re a proven edge, but where’s the data? There’s no real backtesting shown—no proof that trading based on these levels consistently outperforms other strategies. It leans heavily on the idea that “institutional traders” rely on these bands. That’s a convenient narrative, but vague. Institutions use a wide range of tools—most of which are rooted in market context, not just technical overlays.

1kpdbz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kpdbz9/my_twoday_espresso_journey/,My two-day espresso journey,"I spend an unconscionable amount of money at Starbucks, so I decided to take the plunge and make my own drinks. After spending many hours scouring this sub and several like it, I bought a Breville Barista Express Impress which arrived yesterday and subjected my family to several cups of the saddest, sourest, lukewarm lattes using beans I bought in February 2024 (the reason why I still have those beans is a different story entirely). My pucks were all over the place and I was pulling shots at like 15 seconds. It tasted so gross. Anyway, I’m pretty sure the beans were at fault, but the grinder in the Breville probably wasn’t helping either (I promise I did learn something from reading all the posts here), so I ordered a Bambino Plus, a 1Zepresso J-ultra, and a couple other accessories that all arrived a few hours ago (hooray Amazon). Also went on a field trip earlier to buy freshly roasted beans and return the other machine.

At around 10:30pm I pulled the most delicious espresso I have ever had in my life and I don’t even think I’m dialed in perfectly yet. Added some properly steamed milk and I nearly melted. To be honest, I didn’t really believe y’all that coffee could taste thaaat much different just because you have different beans/tools/blah blah. I’m effectively in shock.
