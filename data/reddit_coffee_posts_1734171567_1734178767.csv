**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

One day my dad knocked coffee on it. He cleaned as much as he can and like 10+ years ago would take it to different people to try to fix it. I was wondering if there is any new age stuff that might can help with this? Really want to get the pictures out for my mom for her birthday.

I asked her out, and we went for coffee. The date was amazing! I honestly thought she might be the one. But as it turned out, she wasn’t. While she was friendly, it didn’t seem like she was that interested in me, or in dating in general. We hung out twice, and then we kind of just drifted apart.

Here’s the twist: Britney is my neighbor. She lives just two minutes away from me. So, I kept seeing her almost every day when I was out walking in the neighborhood. Ever since I met her, I felt this dominant vibe about her. But it was subtle, like she didn’t even realize she had it.

A couple of months passed, and I thought about texting her about findom. But I hesitated because, honestly, what if she thought it was weird? Having to see her every day afterward and avoiding her would’ve been super awkward.

Earlier this month, I moved out of my house and into another neighborhood. I was so excited because I finally felt free to text her about it. I wanted to bring it up in a natural way, though.

We were chatting one day, and she mentioned how tired she gets from work. So I casually said, “I could pay for your stuff sometimes, you know.” She was like, “What the heck are you talking about?” I explained, “Yeah, there’s this thing called findom,” and I started breaking it down for her. She wasn’t really interested at first but asked me to tell her more about it. I shared my experience with her and then told her to think about it.

A few days later, she accepted. She said we could try it out but warned me that we’d stop anytime she felt uncomfortable. I completely agreed and decided to take things very, very slow.

Recently, she texted me out of the blue, asking me to send her money right away. I got so excited that I ended up sending her more than she asked for!

She told me she still needs time to learn more about it, so I’m trying to be patient. How do you think I can help her open up to her dominant side more? She’s willing to learn but doesn’t know much yet. I’d really appreciate any advice!

also, For someone new to this, what are the best resources or tips I could share with her to help her understand the dynamic better? Lastly, is there anything I should watch out for as we navigate this dynamic together?",1,1734178516.0,paypigsupportgroup,0,1.0,False

Here’s what we’ve learned:

1. **Most of you are playing the long game.** Buy-and-hold strategies (including BRRRR) reign supreme, with the majority of respondents leaning into rentals to build wealth over time. Makes sense, slow and steady wins the race, right?
2. **A significant portion didn’t close a deal this year.** Nearly 60% of respondents reported 0 deals, which could mean many of us are still learning, waiting for the right opportunity, or just surviving a challenging market. If this sounds like you, don’t worry, you’re not alone, and this subreddit is here to help, sometimes.
3. **Some of you are absolutely crushing it.** A small but impressive group managed 10+ deals this year, with a few even surpassing 20. Clearly, some seasoned pros are among us. (Teach us your ways, oh wise ones!)
4. **Creativity is alive and well.** While rentals and flips were popular, there’s also a healthy dose of investors exploring unique strategies: whether that’s commercial real estate, short-term rentals, or something entirely different.

We’ve seen how you’re tackling the market and how active you’ve been this year, now let’s talk about where you’re finding your opportunities. What’s your go-to deal source?

Did you score a property thanks to your cousin's barber's neighbor? Or stumble across a hidden gem during your morning coffee run? We want to hear it all!

Let’s make this fun, insightful, and maybe even a little inspiring. Vote away!

Two weeks ago we were having a fight and we were on a edge to break up. We sit and talk about it and figured it out in the next days but after that he said he ordered a gift for me to make up that fight. He said, you will LOVE this gift. And then I started to guess some stuff, did you got me a terrarium?! Or a flute, or a plant? Socks? A coffee mug?! And then he got angry and showed me the gift that he bought. It was a gold necklace that was not even my taste. I was so upset that he spent our money on such an expensive and unnecessary gift and I couldn't hide it.

I always left him big clues about what I like and what I don't like. I always told him that instead of an expensive gift I would always appreciate a gift that was thoughtful. Maybe a small letter about his feelings or a small trip to the lake. But in this gift he doesn't have any effort, just our money. He didn't even stop to think what I like. I thanked him and then I told him that instead of spending so much money in jewelry we could've buy some furniture for our house. Or go to a massage that we wanted for years. I asked him if he can cancel the order. But he said he can't.

So today that gift arrived. We were sleeping and woke up to the cargo. I thought it was a chandelier or something for our home but after we opened it, I saw the gift. I opened it and I said let's not throw away the packaging yet. I thought he understood what I mean in our first conversation. But he got upset and angry again and said okay let it there I will sell it to my friend. This surprise is fucked anyways. I told him, no! I like that you have thought about a gift to make me happy, but it's just too expensive, but I will wear it for you. Then he said no, take it off I will sell it and take the money back. 

I feel so bad for hurting his feelings. He wanted to make me happy but instead he made me sad. And he feels heartbroken and disappointed now. But couldn't he knew what would make me happy after 2 years? And while we have spent all of our money to buy furnitures for our new house why would he buy such an expensive gift anyways?

The room is a double bedroom with its private bathroom. It is the second bedroom in the flat and the full bathroom is yours, no one else will ever go in it.

I've been living in this property for over two years now, l am planning to extend my contract by another year however my roommate is moving out.

The flat is just 5 minutes from Pudding Mill Lane station (DLR) and a short walk to Stratford, close to great amenities like Westfield Stratford, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and riverside walks along the River Lea.

The rent is £1050 plus bills (approx. £150). Gas is included in the rent.

A bit about me - I'm a 31-year old, working in architecture. I’m a friendly, respectful, and tidy professional who loves creating a warm and welcoming home environment. I’m passionate about food. When I’m not exploring the city, I enjoy dancing or relaxing with a movie. I value a balance of personal space and quality time with my flatmate – whether it’s sharing a meal, chatting over coffee, or a cosy movie night. If you’re looking for someone who’s easygoing, considerate, and brings positive vibes to the flat, let’s chat!

Please feel free to reach out for more details or to request viewing. It would be great to set up one before 20 December as I'll not be in London for the holidays.
Moreover, contract and agency checks need to be done by the beginning of January. New tenancy contract starts in February.",1,1734177976.0,londonrenters,0,1.0,False

I only ever really started having problems with eating for a little over a year now. I only ever restrict, and I work out, that's about it. Longest fast I've done is 36 hours but I still had to drink black coffee during it.  

I always feel so guilty when I eat and after I eat. I've got bad body dysmorphia. I lost >!7kg!< since last year, and that made me go from >!19.7 to 17s!<, but I still feel like I look the same. I can't even properly >!purge by throwing up!<because I grew up with little to no food most of the time, so wasting food makes me feel worse than anything else. If I'm outside, I will eat my friends' or family's leftovers if they offer it to me for the same reason, but the guilt stays and my mind does not shut up about it. 

I've been trying to get a psych appointment, because I wanted someone to confirm if I actually am disordered or I'm just trying to fit in, but I'm also scared of them telling me it's the latter. I fear they'd say it's ridiculous for me to be at least anorexic if I don't look like it. My thighs never seem to go anywhere, and my genes give me big and thick calves. I want to look worse before I see a doctor, but I literally can't. I'm in uni, so close to graduating. Nursing school takes so much of me that sometimes I just say *fuck this disorder* and I eat all my meals, because during summer when I was at my best at restricting, my brain fog was so bad, I kept failing my quizzes, I was so irritable and just tired all the time. I had so much I needed to study and had no energy for it. It's so hard, everything about this is hard.

I'm looking forward to trying the 5x40ml pours I have seen online and the new one I saw today of 3 pours, 50, 200, 50, so for that I will use the glass jug.. 

I don't have a gooseneck kettle or a temperature control kettle, I use the small gooseneck lidded pot to pour just boiled water from the kettle. 

I have that hario slim hand grinder as sometimes I  buy beans but despite research and clicking that thing where it's meant to be, it seems to me not great, and so I usually use a ground coffee from Colombia Roasters 

Oh, I should add that I have been decaf only for the last year so altho there are some great decafs out there my expectations and 'joy factors' are lower than when I first started brewing I guess

I usually only brew one cup at a time..

Sorry if my English is not perfect as this is not my first language

My current medication is 15mg aripiprazole and 30mg dextroamphetamine a day

So back in December when I was 15 I had my first psychotic episode and I had mainly the following symptoms:

Severely disorganized speech and thinking

Severe cognitive problems (could barely form a sentence and was not able to follow conversations)

Altered perception

Paranoia (constantly thought I had a health problem and was going to die and thought I was being followed by police)

Odd behavior and responses

delusions (thought I was a super genius and the government was following me because of this)

Negative symptoms (loss of libido, motivation, facial expressions, and lack of contact with people around me)

My symptoms were really severe to the point I was wandering in the supermarket not being able to think. Barely had the motivation to pick up a glass of water and drink it and dropped out of school

Started aripiprazole in March at a low dose (2.5mg) that was increased slowly over the next months to 15mg. I noticed slight blurred vision for a couple of days when the dosage was upped but this went away and I don't have any other side effects. Aripiprazole helped mainly with positive symptoms and also helped with my negative symptoms a bit although it took a long time to fully work (had continued improvement over a period of 6 months). As my disorganized symptoms went away it also became easier to follow conversations and it felt like the noise in my brain went away. It also reduced my negative symptoms but I still had some negative symptoms but then I got put on dextroamphetamine that completely fixed my negative symptoms. Dextroamphetamine feels like a strong cup of coffee but without the tolerance. I am now living a good and productive life and going back to school

Also I am diagnosed with MCDD that is a form of autism with really mild psychotic symptoms that causes full blown schizophrenia at a older age",1,1734177855.0,schizophrenia,0,1.0,False

Lots of mixed messaged since. What does it mean?,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 years, living together. Relationship going seemingly great. Very much in love. We have been talking about marriage and the future. We had a fight about a week ago, where initially it seemed for unclear reason, now I have more clues as to what triggered it.

The fight occurred after she returned from work (she had a social event with alcohol was involved), and she became emotional and cried after returning home. To skip the details of the fight, she ultimately ended up grabbing a few things and leaving to stay somewhere else. This happened about a month ago as well, similar situation where she stayed somewhere for the night and returned the next morning. After the initial incident, we had talked about the fight, and I shared with her my trauma of abandonment (past experiences with an ex). She seemed very understanding and empathetic at the time.

This time around, she messaged me the next day telling me she needs a couple of days to gather her thoughts and was not ready to come home. Over the next couple days, she came home and grabbed some work clothes and her pets so she can have some company. This was a week ago.

Since then, there has been a lot of mixed messages that as an overthinking, causing a great deal of anxiety and stress for me. I recognize I have an anxious attachment personality, and have realized that my emotions and anxiety have been getting the best of me. Actively working to control it. Some key events since:

The fight happened on Friday. She did come home on Saturday and we didn't argue or fight, just cuddled and slept. On Sunday morning, she woke up and packed some things and brought her pets. We had a brief talk before she left and she indicated multiple times that she was not thinking about breaking up and needed a couple of days to gather and process her thoughts.

On Monday, we met after work and grabbed dinner and just sat in the car. She was not ready to talk or come back home. She said she needed until Friday.

On Tuesday, I helped her run work errands after work and went for dinner. She had a very busy week of work. After errands, she ended up coming home for a couple of hours, and we spent some quality time together with intimacy. I dropped her off where she was staying at the end of the night. We agreed to see each other Thursday.

On Thursday, she messaged me during work and indicated that she couldn't meet, indicating that she had work errands to run and wanting to go to the gym. By Thursday, I realized that my attachment anxiety style has gotten the best of me, and that I wasn't giving her the appropriate space to process her thoughts. And by spending time with her, I am actually prolonging our time apart. I told her this over the phone and she was really appreciative. I also told her I booked a therapy session to help deal with my anxiety and emotions. After my therapy session, she messaged me saying she missed me and asked to go out for a coffee. We went and she was able to open up a little, where she felt distance between us leading up to this, due to issues like too much screen time, etc. She felt connected to me Tuesday for the first time in a while.

I apologized to her and promised to make an effort to spend more quality time together, and that I shouldn't have grown complacent in our relationship just because I felt secure with her. She asked to spend the night together at home. We spent the night doing crafts and fell asleep cuddling, some intimate time in the morning before work.

When I checked in on Friday, saying that it was great that we made some strides and momentum in resolving this issue, she went back to saying she still needs time to gather her thoughts. No definite timeline as when we'll be able to have a deep conversation about it or when she will come back home.

All in all, I feel like there's a lot of mixed messages. The anxious side of me feels like she is finding a safe way to slowly pull away and break up, but she is having moments of ""weakness"" hence the seeing each other through the week. When we msg during the day, her responses seem short and direct (almost dismissive in a way). No I love you's. Cancelling plans that we made previously.

The hopeful side of me feels that she loves me and missed me, and that's why we haven't been in complete no contact. Maybe it's her way of trying to find her own time, while also reassuring me that she's still in this relationship. When we were talking over phone or together, she does say I love you back when I say it to her, although less enthusiastically than she normally says.

Apologize for the long post, but just feel like there's a lot of back and forth and mixed messages. She hasn't given us a definite time to talk, which makes the waiting even worse. Any opinions or advice is greatly appreciated.",0,1734177808.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

I had no idea that you were trying to see me and talk to me in general over these past few months? I, myself had recently accepted my doom of gloom, from my previous lession learnt.

When we are in the same place. Somehow, amongst all the chaos and other tasks to be completed. You can see me and I see you.
I adore that the fact that you've found other ways to talk to me without current prying eyes and gossiping mouths, interfering.
I've learnt my lesson by my original ex-twin flame person, that I shouldn't be the *first* to brake mutal protocols and push mutal unspoken boundaries. We both share the same conclustion of what is yet to come.

All because I have let my inner self. Heal from previous wounds and band aids are off. I have been more open to idea, communicating with you. Not as a replacement for previous lost soul connection that I had come to treasure and lost. The another you. Somehow, you've relite the fire of hope back into my little universe. The same universe of my own that once I had lived, passed out into a black hole. These recent months, when I see your face, you reminded what sunshine can bring. Then I realise that you are reflecting back the same sunshine  that I used to bring to other people, even on their dull days.

I wished that we could meet up for coffee rather then taken the route of pitstops inbetween our tasks and down play it from prying eyes and gossiping mouths. I trully want to get to know you for who you are and not some reflective echo of someone who I used to know. I'd welcome any chances to socialise outside with you. If this helps you to feel more comfortable with me and you can bring another supporter along, to our first meet up and I can do the same.

Up until I hit 50 units, I has almost zero side effects and any side effects I did have, I could easily manage - drinking more water, adding for fiber, etc. 

I didn’t want to come off Sema until I hit my goal of 185 but I think it is time to give my kidneys a break. Although possibly unrelated, I ended up with a nasty kidney infection a few days after hitting 50 units. I didn’t take my next shot while I was on antibiotics and then reduced to 25 units when I started back up with the go ahead from my physician. However, since going back up, I am experiencing some continued issues - awful smelling urine being one of them. I drink enough water and electrolytes to practically waterboard myself so dehydration is not the issue. I don’t drink coffee, alcohol, etc. I try to eat as close to 1 gram of protein per ideal body weight.

I typically take my shots in the evening on Saturdays but today I am stopping. I know the kidney issues could be unrelated but I’d like to give myself a chance to see if the issues subside once I am off the medication (I’ve read posts where they do so fingers crossed) and I’d also love to see if I can continue my weight loss without the medication. My goal is to continue with my protein intake and continue lifting weights and getting my steps in. I encourage anyone who doesn’t lift weights to start! You don’t have to throw 200 lb plates around at the gym. I do LIIFT MORE via BODI with up to 40 lb dumbbells and absolutely love it! If you’re new to lifting, you could start with the LIIFT 4 program and move up. 

This medication has been life changing and I wouldn’t have started without reading all of your posts. Literally spent weeks going through posts to make my pro and con list.

1he176k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TastefulCoffee/comments/1he176k/keurig_kduo_single_serve_coffee_maker_review_from/,Keurig K-Duo Single Serve Coffee Maker - Review from My Experience,"Recently tested the Keurig K-Duo Single Serve K-Cup Pod & Carafe Coffee Maker, and thought I'd drop some thoughts since some folks out there might be deciding between a couple of options. First off, my initial impression when unboxing it was ""damn, this is pretty!"" The sleek black design was right up my alley, giving a nice modern touch to my admittedly dated kitchen. As someone who usually tosses aside instructions and hopes for the best, the setup was surprisingly straightforward—I mean, there’s a 60oz removable water reservoir which is clutch 'cause you don’t have to drag the whole machine around just to fill it.



I test a lot of coffee makers, more than I probably should if I’m honest, and with the K-Duo, I felt a bit like a makeshift barista in my own home. This bad boy can brew you a single cup with those K-Cup pods or whip up a full carafe, which is perfect for when I've got family over or just need that extra kick to get through the day. And thank god for its multiple brew sizes—whether I’m groggy or just plain indecisive on a Monday morning, it’s got me covered, ya know?

Want to know the cost? [Click here to find out.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/keurig-k-duo-review-versatile-brewing-at-its-best-b07pc7mhq8/)

Sharing a little mishap I had: Picture this—I'm all ready for a big presentation, and I decide to use the auto-brew feature. Everything’s set the night before, but in my pre-coffee zombie mode, I forgot to put the carafe back under the spout. Came back to my own little coffee swamp on the counter. Not my brightest moment, but it’s one of those you just gotta laugh at, right?



If you’re curious about how it stacks up against the Ninja DualBrew or Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, here’s my two cents: The coffee maker's user interface is super simple and the auto-brew feature’s pretty rad. The Ninja, though, has a slightly bigger water tank and gets your coffee in hand a bit quicker. Hamilton Beach? It’s alright, doing the dual brewing thing too, but it just ain’t as pretty in my opinion.



Price-wise, the K-Duo isn't gonna hurt your wallet too bad for all it offers. Thinking on how I end up using just what I need, it feels like I'm saving in the long run. If you’re the kind of coffee lover who flips between wanting a quick cup and lounging with a whole pot, this one hits that sweet spot.



Pros? Tons of 'em: versatile with the single-serve and carafe options, no need for constant refills with that 60oz tank, and of course, easy peasy to set up and use. Downsides? It's a bit of a countertop hog, so if you're short on space you might need to get creative. And sure, some plastic bits might not scream high-quality, but it’s really more of a nitpick unless that’s a dealbreaker for you.



Oh, and watch out on the noise—thing can sound like a mini engine when it’s brewing.



What you get in the box: the coffee maker itself, a nice glass carafe, this gold-tone mesh filter for those who are into using their own grind, some starter K-Cup pods to get you going, and a manual—just in case you’re not one to wing it like me.



Overall, the Keurig K-Duo is doing right by me for now. Whether it's cranking out a quick cup in the AM or hosting my caffeine-addicted family, it’s kept me satiated and a bit less grumpy in the mornings. If you snag one, curious to hear if you end up in a similar caffeine haze or dodging the same pitfalls. Cheers!",1,1734176528.0,TastefulCoffee,0,1.0,False

After brain trauma it’s been harder than before. Now onto my job.

I work in Croatia at this awesome cafe/bar. My regulars are awesome people who have both watched and helped with my journey of learning the local language. They have helped me so much and never asked for anything in return. Many of them call me various nicknames of endearment and are very proud of their “American Daughter-in-law”.

Every so often I get the wild card of just general mean person. I usually get a warning from one of my regulars or they will chew them out if they go too far. The normal for their rudeness is to shout their order as fast as possible before I can get a hello or good day out. I’ve worked here for over half a year now. After hearing these orders daily I am very confident and at least fluent in the range of my work. 

Today I got one of the biggest a-holes I’ve ever met. I can tell the difference between orders even with slang and dialect differences due to hearing them hundreds of times every day for months now and this man absolutely boiled my blood. There was no one else but me and him and he attempted to berate me for a solid 5 min about messing up his order. I know what he said, I may not be fluent in the whole language but I can tell the difference between coffee with milk and coffee with COLD milk. There is a very distinct difference even when spoken quickly.

After a while of back and forth he demanded I make him a new drink for free. Now, I own my mistakes and will pay for a drink I make poorly and remake it but even then they still pay for at least one drink. He wanted BOTH drinks and wanted them both free. It was not happening. Anyway to make a long rant short I finally got one of my male coworkers who work in the attached gas station and the man was set straight. He was so pissed he had to pay and threw his change at me. It slid so hard one coin is still yet to be found but it’s only like ten cents so I’m not too fussed.

My male coworker laid into this man and he finally just hung his head and drank his drink. He tried to order another one but I refused unless he paid up front and he refused.

1he11y3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1he11y3,Flew too close to the sun ,"I can’t remember if I saw this here or over at r/aeropress, but someone recently posted a picture of a contraption similar to the one I’ve got perched atop my Frankenstein drip tower.

The OP of that post had jammed the brew chamber of their Aeropress onto the base of a Hario Switch to pull off what they called the “zero press” technique. Naturally, the comments were full of people pointing out that it was just a French press with extra steps—but it was funny enough to stick in my brain. So, when my decaf beans from Friedhats kept clogging everything, I thought, “Why not?” and decided to give it a shot.

Now, I knew early on that no matter how coarse I ground, I’d still need a proper filter setup. Otherwise, I’d end up with some weird, glorified cupping brew full of floating coffee grounds. So, in a stroke of genius, I added a single-cup V60 under the Switch and over the server. Problem solved, right?

Well, everything was going great until I flipped the Switch open. As that dark reddish liquid gold started flowing, I realized with horror that it was gurgling over the edge of the V60.

Panic mode engaged: I slammed the Switch shut, knocking it off the top of the brewing totem in the process. Somehow, I still managed to salvage enough of the brew to fill half a mug. Sure, it came with a healthy dose of sediment, but hey—it actually turned out pretty nice! A bright, balanced cup with a light body and pleasant acidity.

If any of you have experience extracting the Friedhats Tokuma Decaf, I’d love some advice—you’d be saving me a lot of kitchen wipes!

My main issue appeared out of nowhere in the last few months of the project: shaking.

When I tried to do any experiment my hands would shake, particularly if anyone was watching. I think it was partially due to the hostile lab environment and the dread I had going into the lab, but I just couldn't control it. I tried relaxing my shoulders and deep breathing. I tried ensuring I had eaten and not had coffee/tea. None of it helped, the shaking was really uncontrollable.

I'm so worried I'll accept a new position (I have offers) but then get into the lab and I won't be able to do experiments.

Has anyone experienced this? Or heard of it? Are there solutions? I am having blood tests done to see if there's anything medically wrong, but I think it may be psychological. But regardless I don't know how to resolve it. I'm thinking of turning down the position offers until I have it resolved.

Anyway I swim regularly at a private club in Scotland that  has both communal showers and cubicles, and was generally using the cubicles until recently.  What changed this was that it was busy and the cubicles were all taken, so I went to the communcal showers and was  joined by 3 older men probably in their 70s.  They were chatting away and just stripped off their trunks and started washing while continuing their conversation.  Seeing how relaxed they were I actually felt quite comfortable taking off my trunks as well and showering naked.  Felt very naked at first but what made it feel OK was that they included me in their conversation.  I always imagined it would be really awkward to shower naked next to people but this just felt completely natural because everyone was talking normally as if we were just having coffee or something.  The nice thing about this is it's become a regular thing at that time in the morning and starting to see other guys a similar age to me also showering naked who might not have done so before.

This has actually become a high point in my morning routine.  Swimming always used to be such a solitary thing with barely any interaction, but now the chat in the shower after makes it feel a bit more social and also very freeing to be around other people naked.

Posting this because I think it's really positive and more people should do it even if it seems a bit awkward at first, and making conversation makes it feel much more normal. ",3,1734175390.0,CommunalShowers,0,0.71,False

Ever found yourself dreading that mid-afternoon slump into your office chair, feeling like you're sinking into a pit of discomfort and despair? Well, folks, I've been there. But then I discovered the Branch ergonomic chair, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. So, buckle up as we dive into my personal journey with this chair, because if there's one thing I love more than a good sit, it's a good review.
  
  
## First Impressions: The Branch Chair Unboxing

Unboxing the Branch chair was like opening a present on my birthday—full of excitement and a sprinkle of anxiety. As I peeled back the layers of crisp, durable cardboard, I found everything snug, as if it were all part of a design scheme right out of a fancy catalog. There were these bright, colorful stickers claiming how many trees were planted for every chair sold. Adorable, right? It gave me that warm, fuzzy feeling inside, like I was doing my part for Mother Earth just by sitting.

Inside the box, the chair itself looked sleek and modern—like it just stepped off a fashion runway. The fabric had this soft, welcoming texture. I ran my fingers over it, instantly thinking, ""I could take a nap here."" And don’t even get me started on the armrests! They promised just the right amount of support without being annoyingly rigid, which is a feat few chairs manage. 

As I spread out all the pieces on my living room floor—kind of like a puzzle I’d attempt to solve in the presence of my cat, who was determined to “help” me—the overall vibe felt both sturdy and stylish. It was like I was about to become a part of a secret club of chair enthusiasts who found bliss in ergonomic possibilities. You know, the kind of crew that gathers over tea and shares tips on how to sit properly.

## Assembly Required: A Test of Patience and Puzzle-Solving Skills

When it comes to assembling furniture, it’s like entering a competition of patience and wit—especially when facing a new ergonomic chair. I took on the challenge of putting together the Branch chair like I was an aspiring contestant on a home improvement reality show. Spoiler alert: the chair didn't win, but I definitely had my moments of triumph and frustration.

The first step? Unpacking the box felt like unwrapping a surprise gift—until I realized it was more like a jigsaw puzzle with instructions written in a secret code. I laid everything out on the floor and stared at the parts like they were pieces of a treasure map. The good news? Everything was labeled, so I didn’t have to play a game of “find the right screw.” However, the assembly instructions made me feel like I needed a degree in engineering to decipher them.

As I twisted and turned bolts, I learned a few tricks to ease the process. First off, a power drill is a miracle worker, cutting through assembly time like a hot knife through butter. Second, and this one's a gem: keep a small dish nearby for screws and washers. Trust me, they have a sneaky way of rolling off the table and disappearing into the unknown. So, if you’re like me and planning to wrestle with flat-pack chairs, just remember—persistence pays off. And take a break if you're feeling stuck; after all, it's just a chair, not a medieval siege.

## The Anatomy of a Branch Chair: A Deep Dive into Its Features

The Branch chair is like a cozy cocoon crafted specifically for your back, and let me tell you, it’s a game changer! Seriously, when I first sat in it, I half expected to see a cape and tights waiting to transform me into the ergonomic superhero I never knew I needed. 

First up, the adjustable lumbar support is a true marvel. It cradles your lower back in just the right way, like a friend offering you a warm hug after a long day. I’ve encountered chairs that feel like they’ve never heard of ""support,"" but not with this one! It fully adapts to your spine’s unique curves, making sitting for hours feel like a leisurely stroll in the park—well, maybe not a stroll, but you catch my drift.

Now, let’s not forget about the headrest. When I first flopped back into it, I felt like a king lounging on a throne. Its height and angle can be tweaked, ensuring your neck isn’t craned like a curious giraffe. And those armrests? They're not just there for show; they slide and pivot, turning your typing sessions into a dance party. 

All these features come together to create an experience that literally lifts your spirits—excellent for those long workdays when you're staring at the screen, wondering why your coffee isn't more caffeinated. It’s ergonomic excellence, and my back gives it a standing ovation—well, as much of one as my chair allows!

## Finding My Sweet Spot: Customizing the Branch Chair to My Body

Finding the right adjustments on an ergonomic chair feels a bit like tuning a musical instrument—getting that sweet spot can turn discord into harmony. The first thing I tackled was seat height. I remember thinking, ""If I can’t touch the ground, how am I supposed to feel grounded?"" So, I raised the chair until my feet were flat, like they were hugging the floor. What a relief! Suddenly, my legs felt rejuvenated, and my grimaced expression transformed into a grin.

Then came the backrest. I fiddled with the lumbar support, playing around with the position until it wedged perfectly into my lower back like a supportive friend giving me a back rub. That made a world of difference! I didn’t realize how much I was slouching until I actually sat up properly. Who knew I had a hidden posture superhero just waiting to be unleashed?

And let’s not forget about the armrests! At first, they were oddly high, like someone forgot to invite them to the height party. But after a quick adjustment, they nestled right into my sides, making typing feel like a breeze instead of a strain. All these little tweaks really added up. I felt supported, comfortable, and ready to tackle whatever my day threw at me. Isn’t it funny how just a few adjustments can turn “meh” into marvelous?

## A Day in the Life: The Branch Chair in Action

I woke up one morning, dazed and device-less, crammed upon my pillow, realizing it was going to be another long day. You know, the type where I sit at my desk for hours on end. I stretched, groaned, and shuffled over to my Branch ergonomic chair, which I’d dubbed “Ol' Reliable.” Once I plopped down in that welcoming embrace, it was as if the chair greeted me. “Welcome back,” it seemed to say, “Let’s conquer the day!”

First, I dove into some work emails. Typing away and answering questions felt like a breeze; my back didn’t protest as it used to. I was captivated, glancing at my screen while leaning back comfortably. It almost felt like being cradled—totally not how my old chair made me feel, like I was wrestling a brick wall! 

By noon, I transitioned into my gaming zone. I mean, who can resist a good pixellated adventure? My chair transformed seamlessly into my gaming companion. I could shift my posture without any awkward creaks or groans. I even jumped for joy when I beat that level! 

As the sun dipped low and the night crept in, I settled in for another binge-watch session. Flipping through my favorite shows, I found myself laughing, sharing snacks, and lounging, totally at ease. My cushiony buddy had Indeed outdone itself today! I guess one could say, “From work to play, this chair has my back.”

## The Branch Chair: A Marathon, Not a Sprint

If you thought dealing with back pain was a sprint, wait till you settle into a good ergonomic chair and realize it’s more like a marathon. Over the months I’ve spent perched on my chair, there have definitely been some noticeable changes. Initially, I was convinced that comfort was an illusion—like the Loch Ness Monster or my ability to finish a Netflix series in one weekend. But here’s the twist: I actually started noticing my posture improving. 

At first, after a few hours, I’d wiggle around like a fish out of water, trying to find some semblance of comfort. But now? I can sit through extended Zoom calls without contorting into a pretzel! Seriously, my productivity shot up like a caffeine-fueled rocket. I noticed I wasn’t just completing my tasks faster; I was also more focused. Who knew that a bit of ergonomic magic could replace my desperate coffee breaks with actual work?

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/branch-ergonomic-chair-reviews> 

Now, durability is a whole chapter on its own. My chair—let’s just say it’s taken a beating. There are a few scratches from my clumsiness (I may have bumped into it… or my pet chased a squirrel into my office). But generally, it holds up well. You can still put your faith in it for those long hours. Sure, there are signs of wear—some cushions a tad less plush, and the armrests? Let’s just say they’re not as pristine as day one. But it’s like a comfy old friend; it still supports me in style.

## Conclusions
  
  
So, after months of putting the Branch ergonomic chair through its paces, I can confidently say it's more than just a seat; it's an investment in my comfort and well-being. If you're tired of chair shopping and ready to find your perfect perch, give the Branch chair a whirl. Your back, and your future self, will thank you.",1,1734174921.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

We had a quick chat, and I mentioned he should join us for the Thanksgiving celebration of the program we’re both a part of. I said I’d text him to remind him, and I did. He ended up coming, and after that, we started texting a lot. We’ve been sharing music, creating a Spotify Blend, and he keeps sending me songs saying, “I think you’d like this one,” like Hold On by The Internet and YSL by June Freedom. Which are like very ""romantic"" songs.

We also started talking about books. He mentioned he had one, and without me even showing interest, he just said, “I can lend it to you.” I said, “Sure,” and he asked if Monday worked. I told him I was out of town but could do another day. We ended up scheduling to meet on Wednesday.  

We’ve been texting late at night too. He hasn’t flirted much, but he once said, “I like how contact lenses look on you,” which felt like an awkward compliment. He’s also said things like my style suits me or that it’s fitting for me to be a teacher. I’ve complimented him back in a similar way, indirectly.  

On Wednesday at 7 PM, we met up. Before that, he texted me, saying he was embarrassed because he couldn’t find the book. I told him it was fine and asked if we were still on for coffee, and he said yes. When we met, he immediately took me to a cute café, and we stayed until 9:30 PM, mostly talking about high school, college, and random stories. There was no awkward silence, and the conversation flowed easily.  

I’m Macedonian, and he’s Albanian, which isn’t super common in North Macedonia, especially for dating. But it felt natural. I work with Albanians but don’t speak the language, while he speaks perfect Macedonian, and we both know English.  

At the end of the night, he said, “Should we get going?” I agreed but mentioned I wanted to go to the restroom. While I was gone, he paid the bill (just an espresso and a tea). When I came back, someone else was in the restroom, so I said, “I don’t want to keep you waiting; we can go.” As we were putting on our jackets, he pointed out the restroom was free again, but I said I already had my jacket on. I’m not sure if he thought I made up the restroom thing so he’d pay, but I did offer to pay him back, and he wouldn’t accept. I feel very stupid about how that situation played out.

While walking out, I joked that it was “very Albanian” of him not to let me pay. He said it’s a common thing, and I mentioned how my Albanian coworker does the same. I’m curious if he paid as a gentleman on a date or just because it’s a cultural thing.  

After that, we walked to a bus stop. I asked if he was waiting for a bus, and he said, “I’m waiting for you.” I told him I usually walk home, and he said he’d walk too but in the opposite direction. We hugged lightly and went our separate ways.  

I texted him, thanking him for the tea and the company, and he replied by asking if I got home safely. We ended up texting until 2 AM, but I sent the last message saying I was going to bed. He replied the next day and now we just text without ever really ending the conversation, se just reply whenever sometimes that's like after 12 hours sometimes like 2 minutes.

I don’t know what to think. We text back and forth without really ending the conversation or saying good night. He did mention once, “Next time we see each other,” to remind me to show him the fortune cookie fortunes I keep in my phone case. The conversation hasnt been that active but we also don't  have a dynamic to ask what are you up to, how are you or what's up we just text actually conversation deep in topics and stuff.

What should I do?

I definitely find him attractive, and would have wanted to think the outing was a date I am just so confused. We are friends but had never gone out alone before this or texted as actively, we would just talk about random things mostly connected to the program we are a part of and some small talk.",2,1734174672.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Here in the UK, I can't think of any fruit or vegetable in a traditional dish that doesn't grow here naturally. Fruits like bananas/oranges/lemons/tomatoes have been around for ages but wouldn't be considered a traditional ingredient in anything obvious at least.

Things like cocoa/coffee/tea/various herbs and spices have long been imported to Europe but that's all I can really think of.

There are of course many examples of non-native crops becoming hugely important to a country's cuisine, the potato being perhaps the most obvious one, but I believe that in the majority of cases they can survive there year-round with minimal human intervention.

As an example of what I'm talking about, the Korean chilli pepper/Gochu has long been ubiquitous in Korean cuisine despite the fact that no chilli pepper plant would survive their winters (I believe). ",2,1734174181.0,AskFoodHistorians,7,0.75,False

The other day, someone posted about using a $12k aero road bike to commute half a mile to their office and was asking for tips to avoid sweat stains on their $300 Rapha jacket. And instead of roasting them, we were actually debating whether sweat-wicking fabric was ""pro"" enough.

I'm not even talking about the obsession over marginal gains. “If you shave your legs, lose 6 pounds, and invest in this $800 derailleur hanger made of aerospace-grade RemcoEvenpoelium, you can save 3 seconds over a 40k.” Meanwhile, I’m out here on my entry-level $9.999 Sirvélo, getting annihilated by old dudes on steel frames that weigh more than my team car.

What’s the deal with everyone pretending they have to remortgage their house to buy their 15th bike? Last month, one guy said he’s living off ramen noodles because he spent his *entire bonus* on a titanium gravel bike he’s too scared to take off-road. This is not normal behavior.

I don't even talked about the coffee stuff. Are you really timing your espresso shots before your group rides, or is this just a bit? Because I’m pretty sure nobody cares whether your beans were hand-roasted by a retired WorldTour mechanic in a remote Italian village.

Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks. Thanks for convincing me to spend more on my bike than in my relationship, for making me feel bad about my tire pressure choices, and for reminding me every day that I’m not nearly good enough to hang with the Cat D Zwifters.

**Earth is Hollow (But I Have Touched the Stars)**



**Rating:** G



**CW/TW:** Emotional hurt, mentions of historical Crowley/OCs



**Summary:**

Nina wants to know exactly what Heaven and Hell are like, so she asks Crowley. What starts as a rather confusing discussion about the nature of the universe soon turns into something she did not expect at all.



**Excerpt:**

>“What will you do?” Nina couldn’t help asking. So far, the answer appeared to be nothing. From what she could see Crowley had done very little since Aziraphale had left, except sit around in the bookshop and drink coffee, or sit around in her flat drinking wine. Sometimes he went out for a drive, though Nina never asked where he had been, sensing he would not tell her anyway.

>“Wait,” he said, as if this was the only obvious answer.

>“How long though?” At some point, she thought, he would have to move on. If Aziraphale never came back then surely he would; perhaps even allow himself to fall in love with another human. That would be the healthy thing to do; it was what she would say to a fellow human after a breakup. It was what she had done for herself.

>“Forever.”

>“That’s…” *Stupid,* she wanted to say, but caught herself and instead said, “romantic,” even though she wasn’t sure it was.

The last 2 months I only drink 1 espresso in the morning. That’s it for the whole day.

But suddenly it seems like I am overreacting to my 1 cup a day. This almost seems to have happened over night 

Anyone else has experienced this? 

I get dizzy and nauseous for hours after the coffee. 

My only solution now is to stop completely with my coffee intake. Today is the first day.

Still, that’s probably just an hour or two so maybe we can keep it pretty short.  

The kids want to make pizza this weekend.  I got all the ingredients but forgot pepperoni.  I have to go to Walmart.  Hate that place, but it’s the only grocery store in town.  They love to make pizza on the grill so I’ll get pepperoni.  I need roma tomatoes anyway.  

I’m wrapping presents this weekend.  Lots of them, hopefully.  And drinking coffee since I remembered that.  Thank goodness.  And I set up a chipping area in my house so I do a lot of chipping from various distances.  Before you ask, I use foam balls and my bird dog brings them to me if I miss the little net.  He really wants to chew them up.  I bet it would feel super satisfying to him to squish and rend the little foam balls he snatches.  It’s killing him and I see how much he wants to destroy them.  It’s funny but a little sad too.  

I hope the weather gets to the 60’s today and 70’s tomorrow like it says it will.  It didn’t get warm at all on Friday and I need a little warmth.  Plus I could maybe go by the golf course on Sunday if it’s warm…

Have a good Saturday.  Watch some cartoons like ya did when you were a kid.  They’re super annoying now and you should have to endure it like I will.  😂

1. You might not get the 'Come to Jesus' moment when you try stims. I did not. You might, like me, be BUZZED OFF YOUR BIN. For weeks and weeks. It may take months to sort out the levels or meds that work for you. Take heart.
2. Every day is different on stims. Some days the meds made me fall asleep. Most days they made me 'i've had aaalll the coffees' wired. If you had/have anxiety - that can cause you to feel like you've left someone's baby somewhere on a train. That will ease over the weeks. If you hydrate, eat, exercise and sleep.

Every day is different. I repeat - Every day Brings a Different Experience - so watch, learn and listen to yourself actively each and every day. Don't lose hope. You are your own human diary on the path to feeling better.

3. It can take months for the stims to settle in your system. It can feel speedy throughout that time. Some days less than other. Take note of makes it worse.

4. Feeling speedy does not mean you do not have ADHD. Nope. I feel speedy also on phernergan (designed to knock you out) and on anesthetics (sp?) Some of us are highly reactive to EVERYTHING.

5. Start with a big glass of water. Then have a feed of protein. Take the meds.

6. Eat all day. Drink all day. You'll feel weird if you don't. Or, you won't, but your body will rise up and roar at you at some point. Effectively you are propelling it along like a car, so give the car fuel or else some weird-assed danger-smoke will appear from the bonnet. (This is not an analogy for flatulence.)

7. Going for a walk first thing is great. It gets the dopamine moving and on stims your body knows what to do with these.

8. Going for any walks or exercise is good.

9. Drink water all day. Again. Stims are stimulating your whole body. Water it.

10. Sleeeeep. This one is such a balls to do, but you need lots of sleep. Your body is working hard. Rest it. Set three alarms at different times in the evening telling you to get the f\*ck to bed. Nicely.

Know that you will ignore these alarms. Because you are an ADHD eejit who likes to ignore your wiser self for the sake of a good book/movie/silence in the house cos the kids are finally asleep.

11. Perimenopause is a b\*tch. Take all the hormones.

12. Booze, even 12 hrs after your meds, can feel really weird. Not a feeling I've ever had before. Half a drink and I felt odd. Not tipsy, not tired, otherwordly. Not worth it. And it was a really nice gin & tonic too. I binned it.

13. If you are having trouble sleeping, get melatonin. 2mgs was way to low for me. Biovea is a site that delivers to Ireland. It has 10mg ones. Even in chewable if you can't swallow pills.

14. Melatonin is not bad to take for extended periods of time, so let yourself off the hook. Sleep is crucial for this process to work.

15. You can take breaks, so you are not locked into this med like antid's. You are not stuck on them forever. However, during the first (could be white-knuckle ride) few weeks, month and a half, it's probably better to stay on them so your body gets the time to adjust.

Yes, that means no lie-ins. Because you gotta take them kinda early. But it will be worth it.

16. Your brain may still be deeply THERE'S A SQUIRREL SIDEQUEST WHAT WAS I DOING 3 SECONDS AGO, but you will be able to get more done. And you will start to feel more joy in moments. Smiles will begin to appear on your face. You may start singing Xmas carols and scare the dog.

17. There's more, but I can't think of it. Because I have ADHD and I can't finish anyth...",10,1734173311.0,adhdwomen,3,0.86,False
1he0gjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1he0gjj/in_love_with_an_avoidant_attachment/,In love with an Avoidant attachment ,"(36M)In July, I met this woman 35F on Tinder. We talked for a bit and had our first date shortly after. She's a nurse practitioner and frequently just wants to chill at home as opposed to the stress of going out. 

I pick up dinner, we talk, chill at her place. It's amazing. I stay over for the night, wake up, have coffee in the morning , and I'm on cloud nine. After a few more dates, me getting performance anxiety from condoms, she mentions it might not work but we can still be friends, but understands if that's not what I want since we met on Tinder. She pushes me away.

I stay persistent, we get close again. It's amazing. I feel seen. Every single morning I leave her house, I'm glowing for like an hour after. We at some point go through our relationship history. She shares about how she was engaged with her most recent ex and he walked out on her. A few weeks pass. She gets kind of distant.  I get super anxious about it but figure between her being on the spectrum and having a super demanding career, it's no biggie and I'm overreacting.We hang out and she mentions the sex thing is a deal breaker. Pushes me away.

The push pull continues. This time she pushes me away for not being toxic and being too perfect for her. I tell her I love her.  We agree to maintain radio silence for a week and meet up. She breaks silence about half way through to tell me she hopes I'm doing well. The whole week I'm a nervous wreck, dreading this super fulfilling albeit rocky relationship ending.

We hang out and it's amazing again. She mentions talking about me with her therapist and how she's afraid of letting me in because she can't trauma bond with me and doesn't have the out of me being a shitty person. 

The next month is the most happy and fulfilling time in romantic life. We spend copious amounts of time together. I take days from work to go out with her on off days. We have a few times of amazing sex. I've never smiled so much in my life. She asks if we can be official and I gladly say yes. We go to a cousin of mine's Halloween party as a couple. I tell her I love her and she says that she thinks she feels the same but isn't quite ready to say it but that she feels safe with me and she really likes me.

A couple days later we hook up in the morning and it's definitely not my best performance. That evening, we have an incredibly minor disagreement over the phone. 

The next day we hang out and talk out both of the things. We have some wine, cuddle, and watch Netflix before I have to go house sit. 

I get to my folks to housesit and she calls and tells me she can't do this anymore. She thought she was ready but it's too much. I'm understandably sad. I break down and cry on the floor. The next few days I'm absolutely cooked. Like crying multiple times per day, not feeling okay enough to go to work.

She and I have a long conversation on my lunch break a few days later. I ask if she really likes me, and she says yes but that she can't in good conscience be with me because I deserve better.

It's about a month out now. We still talk periodically. I hung out with her and while we had a few moments of closeness over beers, we weren't really intimate. 

I know I can't fix her (or her trauma) nor should I. But I can't shake this feeling that I'm not going to ever meet anyone like her when she's invested. I think this anxiety is compounded by going through yet another holiday season single when basically all my friends and family are with someone. 

I feel lost and I don't know what to do and the whole focus on yourself thing feels hollow. I've tried dating apps and it's the same circling the drain of getting a trickle of matches. Exchanging a few messages and then being ghosted. I've even tried being intimate with a couple long time friends and it all just feels empty.",1,1734173262.0,self,0,1.0,False

I currently have two grinders which are both single dose. The first is a eureka Mignon Oro and the second is the recently released Mazzer Philos.  

My Philos grinds very well, but I find to at it is plagued by retention and has a pretty messy disposition, with coffee grounds spilling often.  Not exactly what I expected at the price point.  I can still return it if necessary. 

The Eureka is being used for my wife’s decaf beans. Having two grinders helps us so that we don’t have to change the grind settings every morning.  You can imagine what a pain that was when the only grinder in the house was the eureka. 

I’m considering upgrading one or the other to a grind by weight grinder.  The two I’m considering are the Fiorenzato Allsense and the Atom 75w.  

Would love to get advice from this group on thoughts.  For reference, we normally drink cappuccinos or cortados over straight espresso shots ( those are occasional ).  I also use an Italian medium/dark roast bean.

Can these supplements have an effect this quickly or is it most likely placebo?

1. You might not get the 'Come to Jesus' moment when you try stims. I did not. You might, like me, be BUZZED OFF YOUR BIN. For weeks and weeks. It may take months to sort out the levels or meds that work for you. Take heart.

2. Every day is different on stims. Some days the meds made me fall asleep. Most days they made me 'i've had aaalll the coffees' wired. If you had/have anxiety - that can cause you to feel like you've left someone's baby somewhere on a train. That will ease over the weeks. If you hydrate, eat, exercise and sleep.

Every day is different. I repeat - Every day Brings a Different Experience - so watch, learn and listen to yourself actively each and every day. Don't lose hope. You are your own human diary on the path to feeling better.

3. It can take months for the stims to settle in your system. It can feel speedy throughout that time. Some days less than other. Take note of makes it worse. 

4. Feeling speedy does not mean you do not have ADHD. Nope. I feel speedy also on phernergan (designed to knock you out) and on anesthetics (sp?) Some of us are highly reactive to EVERYTHING. 

5. Start with a big glass of water. Then have a feed of protein. Take the meds.

6. Eat all day. Drink all day. You'll feel weird if you don't. Or, you won't, but your body will rise up and roar at you at some point. Effectively you are propelling it along like a car, so give the car fuel or else some weird-assed danger-smoke will appear from the bonnet. (This is not an analogy for flatulence.)

7. Going for a walk first thing is great. It gets the dopamine moving and on stims your body knows what to do with these. 

8. Going for any walks or exercise is good. 

9. Drink water all day. Again. Stims are stimulating your whole body. Water it.

10. Sleeeeep. This one is such a balls to do, but you need lots of sleep. Your body is working hard. Rest it. Set three alarms at different times in the evening telling you to get the f\*ck to bed. Nicely. 

Know that you will ignore these alarms. Because you are an ADHD eejit who likes to ignore your wiser self for the sake of a good book/movie/silence in the house cos the kids are finally asleep. 

11. Perimenopause is a b\*tch. Take all the hormones. 

12. Booze, even 12 hrs after your meds, can feel really weird. Not a feeling I've ever had before. Half a drink and I felt odd. Not tipsy, not tired, otherwordly. Not worth it. And it was a really nice gin & tonic too. I binned it. 

13. If you are having trouble sleeping, get melatonin. 2mgs was way to low for me. Biovea is a site that delivers to Ireland. It has 10mg ones. Even in chewable if you can't swallow pills.

14. Melatonin is not bad to take for extended periods of time, so let yourself off the hook. Sleep is crucial for this process to work.

15. You can take breaks, so you are not locked into this med like antid's. You are not stuck on them forever. However, during the first (could be white-knuckle ride) few weeks, month and a half, it's probably better to stay on them so your body gets the time to adjust. 

Yes, that means no lie-ins. Because you gotta take them kinda early. But it will be worth it. 

16. Your brain may still be deeply THERE'S A SQUIRREL SIDEQUEST WHAT WAS I DOING 3 SECONDS AGO, but you will be able to get more done. And you will start to feel more joy in moments. Smiles will begin to appear on your face. You may start singing Xmas carols and scare the dog. 

17. There's more, but I can't think of it. Because I have ADHD and I can't finish anyth...

1. An actual minor league (Single-A) baseball team instead of the CPL Salamanders. Enhance Ting park so it would have the appropriate amenities and infrastructure and create a brand that resonates with the community and evokes civic pride. This would set things up for a bit more development around Ting. 

2. A large food hall. Maybe off corporate center drive? Diverse, local foods and a community hangout spot. Ample parking and indoor / outdoor seating. 

3. Building up the other side of the road on Main Street, but with parking and infrastructure in mind. Would love more coffee shops, a brewery, restaurants and retail that can enhance the downtown area.

[EVILYN](https://evilyndm.bandcamp.com) \- *Mondestrunken* (Chaotic Tech Death), obviously not everyones cup of coffee.

They have beaten my guess [FOLTERKAMMER](https://centurymedia.bandcamp.com/album/weibermacht) by -0,07 Points (max is 7.). Speaking of the music itself W*eibermacht* (Black Metal) is well writen but the opera-like singing about pussy licking, dick sucking and BDSM mixed with nursery rhymes is so cringe it makes them look like horny teenagers.

Details- Melkodige estate arabica.

I brew with a V60, 15:225, water at 90-93 Celcius. Grind size is 15 on a Chestnut C2.

I use Lance Hendrick's method, so a double bloom, each bloom with water quantity double the coffee, and rest of the water divided into 2 halves.

Disclosure, prior to this, I had the F9 Mango Punch which was my favourite coffee this year. So the bar for this to reach was pretty high. 

The brew is not bitter. It's very palatable that way. It's pretty flat in terms of flavour when hot, and the acidity is minor at best. Absolutely unremarkable.

However, it's only when the cup cools down, that this coffee comes into it's own. A nice acidity emerges and is felt along the sides of the tongue. The bitterness stays mellow-mild. It also gains some depth of flavour. 

All in all, it's a good bean and a good daily driver. 

However, it doesn't match up to it's marketing. The flavours are simply absent. It's quite a uni-layered taste, and it's just the acidity that makes it work. I get no florals, peaches, or coke. It's not juicy at all, in fact is quite flat. 

Doesn't come close to F9 Mango Punch. If you like bright, clean, juicy cups of coffee, get the Fraction 9 Mango Punch Naturals. It's worth the price and more.
