1nu1vn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1nu1vn0/i_should_just_let_you_live/,I should just let you live.,"I understand your perspective. Why would you want to be with someone who had another relationship in front of your face after you broke up? Why would you want to be with someone who gets angry and hot-headed in an argument? Why would you want to be with someone who isn’t ready to settle down just yet? I was sort of hoping that you would want me regardless, just because it was me.

I think when you love someone, the best thing you can give them is grace. I learned that from being with you. There are superficial things about you that I might have called “dealbreakers” or “red flags,” but when you really love somebody, those things are just a part of who they are. You accept them, and you work around them. I hated that I’d never seen you cook a meal, but I always laughed when I’d open your fridge and see nothing but sparkling water and a lone yogurt container. Part of me hated how much you worked while another part of me admired how smart, dedicated, and respected you were. I loved these things because they were familiar, and it meant that I knew you. I understood you. 

If I could have asked you for anything it would be to give me grace. I’m not as good at this as you are. I don’t have as much practice. I can’t always drown my emotions and turn them into rational thoughts. Sometimes I shut down and need time to process things, but it doesn’t mean that I’m avoiding them. I’m sorry about that. 

I’m also angry. I’m angry for what I extended to you, and what I never got in return. I have grievances, and I want you to understand things from my perspective.

I made it clear within the first month that I couldn’t handle less than a relationship. I made it clear in the second month that a relationship wasn’t ordering takeout, watching movies, and fucking on the couch every single day. I wanted to go places, to live life with another person. I made it clear in the third month that when you were away, I missed you and I wanted to be with you. I was met with icy cynicism and words that felt more like obligations than a true “I miss you, too.” I waited a month for you to come back, and I called you to find you drunk, incoherent, and more willing to jerk off on FaceTime rather than tell me that you missed me. I have 6 voicemails that you don’t remember sending saved in my phone, when you told me you loved me and I played them more times than I’d like to admit because it was the only time you ever said those words. 

I never wanted to be your house cat. I felt constrained, stressed, ashamed, and anxious, and I was always waiting for you to come home and give me the attention I was craving. I watched you go on trips by yourself, I heard stories about impulsive 4 hour drives to go surf in North Carolina, and I always wondered why you couldn’t drive the both of us to Maryland or somewhere else in the city, where no one would know us. I watched you be selfish and I wished I could be as selfish as you. I wish I didn’t put so much pressure on Christmas gifts you never got me or the Valentine’s Day dinner we never had. I just wanted you to show me, just once, that you could be my partner without having to be asked to do so. 

I understand that none of this matters now. I am excited for the day when I look at you and I feel nothing, and laugh at the fact that I was 24 years old and thought for a second that my life with you could ever work. Or that my life with you was even something I really wanted. I can’t wait to feel nothing. But today isn’t that day, and I feel absolutely everything. 

I can’t get a read on you. I can never tell if you truly care, or if you liked having sex with me more than you liked me. Sometimes I convince myself that you are secretly in love with me, but then I remember all of my grievances and I think that a person who was in love with me would have tried harder. I know you care, but I wish you cared more. 

My biggest regret with us is that so much of it was preventable. Why didn’t we drive to Annapolis or Baltimore on a Saturday? Why did we care so much about what people would think? Why couldn’t we have walked to get bagels and coffee in the morning? Why couldn’t we have gone somewhere for a weekend? Why wasn’t I worth any investment?

I was trying to tell you this when I came over. But everything you said killed me and I couldn’t get the words out. I wanted to be soft and tell you all of the things I loved about you, and tell you that in 5 years I would be willing to get pregnant and be married if you’d just give me a little time. I wanted to tell you that I loved you more than I’ve loved any other man because when I’m with you I don’t feel alone, I feel like I’m with my friend. I wanted to let you know that I could sit on the couch and watch movies with you for the rest of my life because I love talking to you and I love hearing what you think about things. I wanted to tell you that we could do things differently and I would be better, because I would finally feel safe and secure. I never got to feel that way with you. 

I know none of this matters anymore, but I can’t keep crying in the shower and daydreaming about vengefully breaking your sliding glass doors anymore than I already am. I need you to know my perspective because I never got enough time to get my words together. I had to be alone, first.

I’ve been working on a story called *The Seven* that explores what it’s like to confront your deepest fears, anxieties, and negative emotions in a very literal, almost fantastical way. It’s heavily inspired by personal experiences and the idea of facing the “shadow” parts of yourself.

I’m curious what people who’ve dealt with mental health challenges think of it. Does it resonate? Does it feel authentic?

I’d really appreciate any feedback, thoughts, or even just hearing if it hit home for anyone. Thanks for taking the time!

p.s. Here’s the first chapter to pique your interest:

# Chapter 1

Panic surged through me as I sprinted down the narrow, pitch-black stairwell, the cold concrete walls closing in on me. I couldn’t see it, but I could feel its presence—the creature was close, just beyond the reach of the shadows. I had been working late, the only one left in the office, when it appeared. One moment, I was alone in blissful silence; the next, it came charging toward me from the darkness, its shape an undulating blur. I didn’t even have time to grab my phone, wallet, or keys—they were left behind in the chaos of my escape. The others had come before, yes, but none of them had felt this dangerous. None had filled me with this level of terror.

As I descended the endless flights of stairs, a hollow, mechanical ticking began to grow louder, its rhythm maddeningly precise. 

*Tick… Tick... Tick… Tick…* 

It was like an old wind-up alarm clock—one of those vintage ones you find in dusty antique stores—only this one had teeth. Its pulse vibrated through my bones, tied to my heartbeat, growing faster and more insistent with every step I took. I couldn’t outrun it, but I had to try.

I reached the bottom floor and slammed through the exit doors, gasping for breath. The cold midnight air slapped my face, biting into my skin. For a fleeting moment, I thought the chill might shock me into clarity, but the thought vanished as quickly as it had come. There was no time for relief.

I pushed forward, my legs aching with every step, my lungs screaming for air. My breath billowed in the cold, swirling before me like a mist, only to vanish into the darkness. My house was only a few miles away, but the thought of being so close, yet feeling so far from safety, gnawed at me. Would I make it there in time? Would I even make it there at all?

The streets were eerily quiet—empty. No cars. No people. Just the faint hum of the city in the distance, barely audible over the sound of my pounding heart. I sprinted past a deserted playground, its swings swaying gently in the wind. A child sat alone on one of the swings, their tiny legs kicking lazily back and forth. The creaking of the chains pierced the silence like a knife. I froze, my pulse spiking.

What was a child doing here, at this hour? Why were they alone, in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere?

The child’s back was turned to me, their small form shrouded in darkness. I couldn’t make out their face, but I felt their presence—chill and hollow. They didn’t move, didn’t acknowledge me. They just stared somberly at the ground, as if waiting for something.

I tried to shake the unsettling familiarity creeping up my spine. I had seen that posture before… but where? And why did it feel like I knew them?

The wind picked up, carrying a whisper through the air, barely audible over the pounding of my heart.

*""You always run, don’t you?""*

My breath hitched. The voice was small, yet it carried a weight far beyond its size. It slithered through my ears, sinking into my bones.

Was it just my imagination, or was the child actually speaking to me?

The shadows around them seemed to shift, stretching unnaturally, bending in ways that defied reason. The air grew thick, heavy—like I was wading through something unseen. I took a hesitant step back, my foot scraping against the pavement.

The child’s head tilted ever so slightly. *Tick***.** A jolt ran through me.

The ticking was louder now, almost deafening. My pulse fought to keep up with the relentless beat.

*Tick… Tick… Tick…*

The ticking wasn’t just sound anymore—it was inside me, reverberating through my skull, shaking something loose. My vision wavered. The playground blurred, the cold night dissolving into something else—something older, buried beneath layers of time.""

The scent of fresh ink and stale coffee filled my nose. A distant murmur of voices swelled in my ears.

I blinked, and suddenly, I wasn’t running anymore.

I was back in the office.

The fluorescent lights buzzed above me, the air thick with the sharp scent of freshly printed reports. It all felt strangely distant, like I was seeing it from a place I could no longer reach. I watched myself, just a year ago, walking through those same sterile doors for the first time. I had been so sure, so full of hope, convinced I could carve out a place for myself, that I could fit in.

But that was before I realized how different I really was. My coworkers had their cliques, their routines, their unspoken rules. I was just… there. An outsider. I tried so hard to belong—small talk by the coffee machine, trying to memorize their names and faces, but each day I felt more invisible. The empty smiles, the awkward silences when I spoke—every gesture felt rehearsed, as if they were all just going through motions I couldn’t quite grasp. And then I started doing things differently. Trying to break out of the mold. Offering help when they didn’t ask for it. Showing up with donuts, but no one seemed to care.

The more I reached out, the more distant they became. I wasn’t part of their world. I was an intruder.

Maybe that’s when it started—when the thing that seemed to be hunting me first sank its claws in. I didn’t know it then, but everything—the isolation, the weight of my own frustration—was feeding it. It was growing, feeding on my doubts, my loneliness, turning them into something real, something tangible.

Still, over time, things began to change. Slowly, I found myself connecting with a few people in the office, and the crushing loneliness started to fade. I began to feel like I was fitting in, like I was finally carving out a small place for myself in the chaos. Small talk at the coffee machine didn’t feel like a chore anymore; it was real. I laughed, I was heard. It was a fragile thing, this sense of belonging, but for a while, it felt like maybe—just maybe—I had earned a spot in their world.

But it was always just that—fragile. Delicate, like a thread that could snap at any moment. It was in the way they looked past me when I wasn’t speaking, or the way conversations would fall quiet when I entered the room, as if I was an afterthought. I had my place, yes, but I also knew it could disappear just as quickly.

Just when I thought I was finally easing into the rhythm of things, something—or rather, someone—came along to shatter that delicate balance. The company hired a new guy—fresh-faced, polished, confident—a stark reminder of everything I wasn’t. It didn’t matter that I’d finally found my way; the moment he walked through that door, my fragile peace unraveled. It was as if the room shifted, the air became heavier, and every interaction was suddenly refracted through the lens of his presence. The office rallied around him instantly—like he was the answer to some unsaid question, the missing piece everyone had been waiting for.

And me? I was just a spectator again. The connections I’d worked so hard to build? Gone. The fragile sense of inclusion I’d clung to, now slipping through my fingers like sand. The emptiness came back in full force.

When I first saw him, my stomach soured, and I heard the first faint *Tick.*“I can’t believe they hired *this* guy…”*Tick…*“He probably had his rich parents pull strings to get him the job…”*Tick…*

I broke him down in my mind, pinpointing everything I didn’t like about him. From his personality to his pretty-boy smile, everything irked me about him. The whole office flocked around him like he was some sort of celebrity—yet on my first day, they treated me like I was invisible. I couldn’t understand what made this guy better than me, but then I overheard one of my coworkers say that he transferred from another branch and that upper management was grooming him to take over the new project manager position. That’s when it hit me—this guy was not just a threat to my social standing, but to my career as well. The last thing I wanted was for him to give me orders. Simply put, I hated him…

Over the next couple of weeks, I became consumed by thoughts of him. I watched his every move, listened to his every conversation. Forced to attend meetings with him, I couldn’t help but observe how he charmed the higher-ups—and it made me sick. He lied through his teeth, spun flimsy excuses for his mistakes, and dumped his workload on me with impossible deadlines. After a month of this, bitterness grew inside me. It felt like nothing I did mattered—the spotlight was always on him. From the depths of my heart, I longed for someone—*anyone!*—to recognize and appreciate my work. But no… in the end, “I” didn’t matter. I often asked myself, *Why did he get everything while I got nothing?*

Resentment consumed me, and my frustrations began to spill over beyond him. Hatred burned inside me, and I unleashed it on anyone I perceived as weaker. From road rage to getting impatient at the grocery store, it felt like everything inconvenienced my already fragile happiness.

One night, I got so worked up that I couldn’t sleep. So, I turned on a movie, hoping that exhaustion would take over. But as I mindlessly watched the screen, my ears suddenly began to burn. At first, I thought nothing of it, but soon, they felt as though they were being seared by an oven.

Minutes later, my right ear felt like it was on fire. I reached up to feel it—and to my horror, my fingers brushed against something soft and furry. Panic surged through me. I scrambled off the couch, knocking the thing off my shoulder. I turned in time to see a small creature bounce off the cushion.

I froze, bewildered, as I took in its strange features. It was about a foot tall, with a round, plump body like a penguin. It had big, floppy ears and a mischievous glint in its eyes. Its sleek silver fur shimmered in the dim light, and a little golden bow adorned its hair.

As I stared at it, my left ear continued to burn. Slowly, I turned my head, only to find an identical creature now perched on my other shoulder. This one had thick golden fur and the same bow, but this one was silver. I reached out to grab it, but the moment my fingers made contact with its soft, pudgy body, it tightened its grip on my ear.

Desperate to dislodge it, I clutched it tighter. After a few moments of struggle, it broke free, landing next to its twin on the couch. The two creatures stood side by side, exchanging a glance before turning their eyes back to me.

They began chanting in unison, their voices so quiet that I could barely make out the words. Cautiously, I knelt down and leaned in, trying not to make any sudden movements in case they went for my ears again. And then, I heard it—the faint sound:

*Tick… Tick…Tick… Tick…*

A chill crawled up my spine as goosebumps spread across my arms. I couldn’t process what I was seeing and hearing—it felt like a dream. I frantically scanned the room for something to contain them and remembered an old birdcage in the basement. I grabbed the creatures, rushed downstairs, and locked them in the cage. Their whispers continued:

*Tick… Tick…Tick… Tick…*

The sound was unsettling, and with every tick, my shoulders grew heavier, more tense. “What were these creatures? Where did they come from? Why did they make my ears burn?” No answers came, only more questions.

The encounter left me jittery and on edge. I hated that they’d been resting on my shoulders without me even knowing it. If it hadn’t been for the burning in my ears, I would have never known they were there. In a daze, I went to the kitchen and glanced at the clock on the oven: *1:02 a.m.*

Too nervous to sleep, I grabbed a bottle of wine, bypassing the glass, and drank straight from the bottle. Alcohol had always helped calm my restless mind. Before long, I was drunk and passed out on the couch, blissfully unaware of what awaited me next.

Nearly no sober woman wants you to walk up to her and ask to make out immediately, and this confuses men who see videos of guys asking for a kiss from a bunch of women in public and getting a “no”. This is generally how I’d picture it going for someone I’ve never talked to before:

- be sober in a social area where other people are hanging out talking

- probably be pleasant, chatty, and obviously outgoing with her, and not others (never hit on more than one person lmao, some people mess up badly here)

- don’t “break the touch barrier”. Verbal consent only.

- chat with her for a while to simply build up some familiarity and convince her she’s not on a TikTok video being recorded lmao. Maybe in the range of 20 minutes to 2 hours. 

- have some amount of tact, buildup, and discretion. Spend time one on one with her. Tell her she looks great, is gorgeous, or something to indicate interest (just one compliment, not a bunch of them). Pay a lot of attention to if she doesn’t seem eager to spend time alone or 1 on 1 with you, because that usually means “no”. Verbally declining whatever invitation I brought up also means “no”. If she doesn’t seem like she wants to reschedule something “a later time”, then of course that’s also a “no”. “I have a boyfriend” is an instant “no”. I generally don’t only ask for a number. 

Depending on the situation, I’d recommend either:

- inviting her to hang out (maybe the right choice for a friend you’re interested in from a friend group?)

- invite her out to volunteer to give you more time to see if she likes you (also, so you can volunteer more, it’s good for your dating life anyway)

- ask her if she’s single, or have a friend ask her if she’s single

- inviting her out for coffee or whatever date works for you

- inviting her back to your place (this is basically for a hookup)

- telling her you want to kiss her (probably only do this if you’re alone in a secluded place and she seems to like you)

- if something gets planned and you just met her, then probably just give her your number. Some women will be inclined to give out a fake number, but giving her yours will likely simplify things to make her more comfortable. 

tl;dr: chat -> get her alone or 1:1 with you -> chat -> compliment -> chat -> invite out for what you want -> accept answer. Accept “no” at any of these steps as a likely sign they’re not interested",2,1759200386.0,PurplePillDebate,4,1.0,False

I began to feel like I was fitting in, like I was finally carving out a small place for myself in the chaos. Small talk at the coffee machine didn’t feel like a chore anymore; it was real. I laughed, I was heard. It was a fragile thing, this sense of belonging, but for a while, it felt like maybe—just maybe—I had earned a spot in their world.

But it was always just that—fragile. Delicate, like a thread that could snap at any moment. It was in the way they looked past me when I wasn’t speaking, or the way conversations would fall quiet when I entered the room, as if I was an afterthought. I had my place, yes, but I also knew it could disappear just as quickly.

Just when I thought I was finally easing into the rhythm of things, something—or rather, someone—came along to shatter that delicate balance. The company hired a new guy—fresh-faced, polished, confident—a stark reminder of everything I wasn’t. It didn’t matter that I’d finally found my way; the moment he walked through that door, my fragile peace unraveled. It was as if the room shifted, the air became heavier, and every interaction was suddenly refracted through the lens of his presence. The office rallied around him instantly—like he was the answer to some unsaid question, the missing piece everyone had been waiting for.

And me? I was just a spectator again. The connections I’d worked so hard to build? Gone. The fragile sense of inclusion I’d clung to, now slipping through my fingers like sand. The emptiness came back in full force.

When I first saw him, my stomach soured, and I heard the first faint Tick.“I can’t believe they hired this guy…”Tick…“He probably had his rich parents pull strings to get him the job…”Tick…

I broke him down in my mind, pinpointing everything I didn’t like about him. From his personality to his pretty-boy smile, everything irked me about him. The whole office flocked around him like he was some sort of celebrity—yet on my first day, they treated me like I was invisible. I couldn’t understand what made this guy better than me, but then I overheard one of my coworkers say that he transferred from another branch and that upper management was grooming him to take over the new project manager position. That’s when it hit me—this guy was not just a threat to my social standing, but to my career as well. The last thing I wanted was for him to give me orders. Simply put, I hated him…

Over the next couple of weeks, I became consumed by thoughts of him. I watched his every move, listened to his every conversation. Forced to attend meetings with him, I couldn’t help but observe how he charmed the higher-ups—and it made me sick. He lied through his teeth, spun flimsy excuses for his mistakes, and dumped his workload on me with impossible deadlines. After a month of this, bitterness grew inside me. It felt like nothing I did mattered—the spotlight was always on him. From the depths of my heart, I longed for someone—anyone!—to recognize and appreciate my work. But no… in the end, “I” didn’t matter. I often asked myself, Why did he get everything while I got nothing?

Resentment consumed me, and my frustrations began to spill over beyond him. Hatred burned inside me, and I unleashed it on anyone I perceived as weaker. From road rage to getting impatient at the grocery store, it felt like everything inconvenienced my already fragile happiness.

One night, I got so worked up that I couldn’t sleep. So, I turned on a movie, hoping that exhaustion would take over. But as I mindlessly watched the screen, my ears suddenly began to burn. At first, I thought nothing of it, but soon, they felt as though they were being seared by an oven.

Minutes later, my right ear felt like it was on fire. I reached up to feel it—and to my horror, my fingers brushed against something soft and furry. Panic surged through me. I scrambled off the couch, knocking the thing off my shoulder. I turned in time to see a small creature bounce off the cushion.

I froze, bewildered, as I took in its strange features. It was about a foot tall, with a round, plump body like a penguin. It had big, floppy ears and a mischievous glint in its eyes. Its sleek silver fur shimmered in the dim light, and a little golden bow adorned its hair.

As I stared at it, my left ear continued to burn. Slowly, I turned my head, only to find an identical creature now perched on my other shoulder. This one had thick golden fur and the same bow, but this one was silver. I reached out to grab it, but the moment my fingers made contact with its soft, pudgy body, it tightened its grip on my ear.

Desperate to dislodge it, I clutched it tighter. After a few moments of struggle, it broke free, landing next to its twin on the couch. The two creatures stood side by side, exchanging a glance before turning their eyes back to me.

They began chanting in unison, their voices so quiet that I could barely make out the words. Cautiously, I knelt down and leaned in, trying not to make any sudden movements in case they went for my ears again. And then, I heard it—the faint sound:

Tick… Tick…Tick… Tick…

A chill crawled up my spine as goosebumps spread across my arms. I couldn’t process what I was seeing and hearing—it felt like a dream. I frantically scanned the room for something to contain them and remembered an old birdcage in the basement. I grabbed the creatures, rushed downstairs, and locked them in the cage. Their whispers continued:

Tick… Tick…Tick… Tick…

The sound was unsettling, and with every tick, my shoulders grew heavier, more tense. “What were these creatures? Where did they come from? Why did they make my ears burn?” No answers came, only more questions.

The encounter left me jittery and on edge. I hated that they’d been resting on my shoulders without me even knowing it. If it hadn’t been for the burning in my ears, I would have never known they were there. In a daze, I went to the kitchen and glanced at the clock on the oven: 1:02 a.m.

Too nervous to sleep, I grabbed a bottle of wine, bypassing the glass, and drank straight from the bottle. Alcohol had always helped calm my restless mind. Before long, I was drunk and passed out on the couch, blissfully unaware of what awaited me next.

I’ve been working on a story called The Seven that explores what it’s like to confront your deepest fears, anxieties, and negative emotions in a very literal, almost fantastical way. It’s heavily inspired by personal experiences and the idea of facing the “shadow” parts of yourself.

I’m curious what people who’ve dealt with mental health challenges think of it. Does it resonate? Does it feel authentic?

P.S. Here is a teaser to pique your interest:

# Chapter 1

 Panic surged through me as I sprinted down the narrow, pitch-black stairwell, the cold concrete walls closing in on me. I couldn’t see it, but I could feel its presence—the creature was close, just beyond the reach of the shadows. I had been working late, the only one left in the office, when it appeared. One moment, I was alone in blissful silence; the next, it came charging toward me from the darkness, its shape an undulating blur. I didn’t even have time to grab my phone, wallet, or keys—they were left behind in the chaos of my escape. The others had come before, yes, but none of them had felt this dangerous. None had filled me with this level of terror.

As I descended the endless flights of stairs, a hollow, mechanical ticking began to grow louder, its rhythm maddeningly precise. 

Tick… Tick... Tick… Tick… 

It was like an old wind-up alarm clock—one of those vintage ones you find in dusty antique stores—only this one had teeth. Its pulse vibrated through my bones, tied to my heartbeat, growing faster and more insistent with every step I took. I couldn’t outrun it, but I had to try.

I reached the bottom floor and slammed through the exit doors, gasping for breath. The cold midnight air slapped my face, biting into my skin. For a fleeting moment, I thought the chill might shock me into clarity, but the thought vanished as quickly as it had come. There was no time for relief.

I pushed forward, my legs aching with every step, my lungs screaming for air. My breath billowed in the cold, swirling before me like a mist, only to vanish into the darkness. My house was only a few miles away, but the thought of being so close, yet feeling so far from safety, gnawed at me. Would I make it there in time? Would I even make it there at all?

The streets were eerily quiet—empty. No cars. No people. Just the faint hum of the city in the distance, barely audible over the sound of my pounding heart. I sprinted past a deserted playground, its swings swaying gently in the wind. A child sat alone on one of the swings, their tiny legs kicking lazily back and forth. The creaking of the chains pierced the silence like a knife. I froze, my pulse spiking.

What was a child doing here, at this hour? Why were they alone, in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere?

The child’s back was turned to me, their small form shrouded in darkness. I couldn’t make out their face, but I felt their presence—chill and hollow. They didn’t move, didn’t acknowledge me. They just stared somberly at the ground, as if waiting for something.

I tried to shake the unsettling familiarity creeping up my spine. I had seen that posture before… but where? And why did it feel like I knew them?

The wind picked up, carrying a whisper through the air, barely audible over the pounding of my heart.

""You always run, don’t you?""

My breath hitched. The voice was small, yet it carried a weight far beyond its size. It slithered through my ears, sinking into my bones.

Was it just my imagination, or was the child actually speaking to me?

The shadows around them seemed to shift, stretching unnaturally, bending in ways that defied reason. The air grew thick, heavy—like I was wading through something unseen. I took a hesitant step back, my foot scraping against the pavement.

The child’s head tilted ever so slightly. Tick. A jolt ran through me.

The ticking was louder now, almost deafening. My pulse fought to keep up with the relentless beat.

Tick… Tick… Tick…

The ticking wasn’t just sound anymore—it was inside me, reverberating through my skull, shaking something loose. My vision wavered. The playground blurred, the cold night dissolving into something else—something older, buried beneath layers of time.""

The scent of fresh ink and stale coffee filled my nose. A distant murmur of voices swelled in my ears.

I blinked, and suddenly, I wasn’t running anymore.

I was back in the office.

The fluorescent lights buzzed above me, the air thick with the sharp scent of freshly printed reports. It all felt strangely distant, like I was seeing it from a place I could no longer reach. I watched myself, just a year ago, walking through those same sterile doors for the first time. I had been so sure, so full of hope, convinced I could carve out a place for myself, that I could fit in.

But that was before I realized how different I really was. My coworkers had their cliques, their routines, their unspoken rules. I was just… there. An outsider. I tried so hard to belong—small talk by the coffee machine, trying to memorize their names and faces, but each day I felt more invisible. The empty smiles, the awkward silences when I spoke—every gesture felt rehearsed, as if they were all just going through motions I couldn’t quite grasp. And then I started doing things differently. Trying to break out of the mold. Offering help when they didn’t ask for it. Showing up with donuts, but no one seemed to care.

The more I reached out, the more distant they became. I wasn’t part of their world. I was an intruder.

Maybe that’s when it started—when the thing that seemed to be hunting me first sank its claws in. I didn’t know it then, but everything—the isolation, the weight of my own frustration—was feeding it. It was growing, feeding on my doubts, my loneliness, turning them into something real, something tangible.

Still, over time, things began to change. Slowly, I found myself connecting with a few people in the office, and the crushing loneliness started to fade. I began to feel like I was fitting in, like I was finally carving out a small place for myself in the chaos. Small talk at the coffee machine didn’t feel like a chore anymore; it was real.

She went silent, to the point I thought we’d been disconnected. I asked, “Hello?” and she loudly snapped, “You only ordered one coffee!”

I told her that wasn’t true, and that I’d be contacting UberEats. She started yelling that the stickers peeled off on their own. I just hung up.

I realize now I shouldn’t have called her, and should have simply contacted support. I was just so pissed off in the moment. But now I’m worried I could’ve been wrong, and might have cost her her job over something she didn’t do. But from her reaction, and from these photos, this seems fairly obvious and cut-and-dry, right? You can see that it’s been opened from her own photo, too. (The scribble on the one photo of the bag is covering my name.)

Support refunded everything and told me, “We will review the delivery person and take the appropriate actions.”

1nu1aey,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_VeteransGarden/comments/1nu1aey/building_a_veterans_community_garden_could_use/,"Building a veterans community garden, could use your ideas and advice","I made this account specifically for this garden project, that’s why it’s new I plan to keep it garden specific.

I am a veteran and this project is made by veterans for veterans. It’s grassroots and not for profit.

I’m working on starting up a veterans community garden in my town, and I’d love to get some feedback from other vets on what would actually make this worth showing up for and give it the value we need in an outdoor space.

The idea started because I kept running into other vets like myself who wanted to garden but didn’t have space. I was growing stuff in pots, wanted more room, but couldn’t afford it. The local community garden is great, but honestly I don’t have a lot in common with most of the people there and I just feel exposed. Around here the only real option to hang out with vets is the VFW or Legion. Nothing against them, but it wasn’t the space I was looking for. So I thought, what if we had a simple garden where vets could dig in the dirt, grow some food, and hang out together.

I don’t own land, so I went down the rabbit hole. I asked myself, “how do I get land to garden for free.” Eventually I found a veteran forward nonprofit that agreed to give me and my crazy ideas into a fiscal sponsorship, which opens the door to grants. Since then things have snowballed with support. Local veteran owned businesses are helping where they can, I’ve got an agriculture teacher advising (because I’m no expert), and even local media picked it up (I refused a video intervieww because I’m a special flavor of paranoid crazy I guess…). We’ve already had donations offered, including deer fencing, wood chips, labor, and a 12x20 timber frame pavilion for classes and vegetable production. On top of that, more partnerships keep rolling in. People really want to help make this happen, which is surprisingly surprising!

I’ve had a few offers of land but need something closer to town. I know I can’t be picky hahahahahha!

I know there are similar projects out there, but I envision this as kind of an outdoor VFW or Legion except quieter, healthier, and focused on learning and community. I have researched and reached out to those programs.

Here’s the vision so far:

• Each vet can have a bed or plot for the season if they want their own space • A communal space for vets who don’t want the responsibility of their own bed but still want the community • ADA accessible: raised beds, wide walkways, shaded areas, and vine screens for folks dealing with PTSD or photosensitivity • Workshops led by local educators: gardening, canning, bees, you name it • “Bro stuff” like chili cook-offs, making salsa, movie nights, coffee mornings, and an earth oven • Anything grown in the communal area will go to elderly vets or be donated to the community • Family-friendly days with a small kids’ play space so childcare isn’t a barrier • Community days where the public can join in since it’ll be ADA accessible • A therapeutic space that could also support alternative therapies or just quiet time

But here’s where I need help:

• What am I not thinking about? I’ve thought about PTSD, bad backs, mobility, TBI and photosensitivity, and making it ADA friendly. But what else could keep someone from wanting to be in a garden like this • If you had a unique situation that made gardening tough, what accommodations would help • Beyond that, what would make you actually want to show up to something like this

I’m also tying this into the VA’s Whole Health program. The idea is that the outpatient clinic here could work together. For example the physical therapists could help vets tailor gardening routines, dietitians could reinforce healthy cooking and eating, and it could serve as a form of movement and passive horticulture therapy for mental health. It’s under review now, and my hope is if the VA health team sees value, maybe they will sign off on allowing the social workers to suggest it as an option. Why not align it with health and wellness while still doing chili cook-offs and letting the kids play in a sandbox hahahahaha!

As soon as we secure land, the agriculture advisor will start drafting plans for irrigation, pavilion, beds, and infrastructure. I want to make sure it’s as versatile and accessible a space as possible.

If any of you have skills you’d be willing to lend advice on like landscaping, design, web, marketing, organizing, or anything else I’d be super grateful. This isn’t for profit, I’m not asking for money, just knowledge, feedback, and guidance. I want to build the best space I can for us.

Thanks for reading, and for any advice you’re willing to share.

TLDR I’m a vet trying to start a community garden for veterans, a space with individual plots, a communal area, ADA accessibility, workshops, and family-friendly days. We’ve got partnerships, donations (like fencing and a pavilion), and even the VA Whole Health program reviewing it. I need advice, what am I missing, what would make you actually want to use a space like this, and any skills, ideas, or guidance would mean a lot.",1,1759198899.0,u_VeteransGarden,1,1.0,False

1.Chapter 1 Her Shadow
Alicia Lawrence jolted awake. She glanced at the half-finished sketch on her desk and the familiar room around her. With a smile touching her lips, she realized she had really come back.

Her eyes fell on the calendar. Today marked three months since Tiffany Lawrence had returned to the family. It was also the very day that the whole family gathered to celebrate Tiffany's return. 'The timing couldn't be better,' Alicia thought, just as a knock sounded at the door.

Alicia opened the door to find her second-eldest brother, Andrew Lawrence, standing outside, frowning at her. ""Alicia, what's wrong with you? I knocked three times. I was starting to think you had died in there.""

At his curse-like words, Alicia simply stared back coldly, saying nothing. Her silence only made Andrew more impatient. ""Is that painting finished yet? Mr. West is arriving in Riverdale in a few days. Tiffany needs to bring it with her to ask him to be her mentor. Don't you dare mess this up for her.""

Alicia's perfectly shaped brows furrowed. ""I spent an entire week on that painting, barely sleeping or eating. Why should I just hand it over to Tiffany?""

Hearing this, Andrew stared at Alicia in disbelief. ""Are you running a fever? Is your brain fried? What nonsense are you talking about? Wasn't that painting always meant for Tiffany?""

He moved closer, voice sharp with impatience. ""If it's done, hand it over. Now. And have you finished anything else lately? I'm not criticizing, but your output is too low. Tiffany hasn't posted in a month. She'll be forgotten if this goes on. From now on, eat less, sleep less, and draw more. For her.""

Andrew said it like it was the most natural thing in the world. And Alicia knew it was her fault. She had spoiled them all in her past life, and now his entitlement was the price she had to pay.

In Alicia's past life, Tiffany was a famous online painter. Her works sold for high prices and won her many fans. Later, she even became a student of Edward West, a well-known painter. This helped her move from internet fame to real-world success, and she became a famous artist.

But no one knew the truth. Alicia had actually painted every piece Tiffany posted online as well as every painting Tiffany created as Edward West's student.

Alicia had been kept like a shadow by the Lawrence family, forced to paint endlessly, all to build Tiffany's career and ensure her success.

In her previous life, Alicia had craved the affection from the family and the love from her mother. Hoping for even the smallest bit of warmth from the Lawrences, she agreed to almost everything they asked, doing whatever was demanded of her.

But when Tiffany became famous, the family worried Alicia would cause trouble. So they locked Alicia in a dark room with chains. She could no longer tell day from night. Her life was reduced to eating, sleeping, and painting while chained. With no contact to the outside world, she could only paint from her mind, and her art became more and more abstract.

Tiffany accused Alicia of refusing to paint well on purpose. As punishment, she locked Alicia in the basement with dozens of starved rats and snakes. The hungry animals attacked and killed Alicia. Before she died, Alicia swore that if she ever had another chance, she would make the Lawrence family pay for what they did.

But after she died, she didn't go to the underworld. Instead, she met an old man with a white beard. He told her to finish nine tasks, and if she succeeded, she could go back to life. So she traveled through nine different worlds, helping the main characters and others achieve their deepest wishes. And now, she had finally returned.

This time, Alicia had no intention of putting up with the Lawrence family any longer. She would never let Tiffany become Edward West's student. So she stared coldly at Andrew and said, ""I painted it, and I won't give it to Tiffany.""

Andrew flew into a rage. ""Alicia, you owe everything to Tiffany. All these years, you've been living as her, enjoying the comfort and privilege of our family. That life should have been hers, but she was the one suffering outside. Now we're only asking you to paint a few pieces for her. What's so hard about that? Do you really think you've been wronged?""

That was true. Alicia wasn't the Lawrence family's real daughter. Twelve years ago, when she was just eight years old, the Lawrence family had forced her to come home with them.

At that time, the Lawrences' youngest daughter, Tiffany, had gone missing. Maria Lawrence was almost broken by grief. Then they found Alicia, who was about the same age as Tiffany. Missing her daughter terribly, Maria saw Tiffany in Alicia and insisted on bringing her home.

Alicia had always had a natural gift for painting. Even as a child, she could paint anything she saw. But without any real training, her work was more about feeling than technical skill.

Later, she met an old ragpicker named Richard Shaw. Richard was a skilled painter who noticed Alicia's love for art and took her in as his student. After a year of learning from Richard, Alicia's painting improved dramatically. She even began selling her work to earn money.

Every day, she would paint and sell her work. Some pieces sold for just a few dollars, others for a hundred or more. Together, she and Richard lived off what he made from collecting scraps and what she earned from her art.

They weren't greedy. The money they earned was enough to get by and even enough to help others. She remembered once even helping a boy in need. But then the Lawrence family came and took her away, forcing her to become their daughter.

Alicia had tried to run away many times to look for Richard, but she could never find him. When she was heartbroken, Maria told her, ""Richard doesn't want you anymore. From now on, the Lawrence house is your home, and we are your family.""

Back then, she was deeply touched. Having never had a family, and now left behind by Richard, she felt completely alone and even began to doubt herself. The Lawrences showed up just when she longed for a place to belong.

After becoming a Lawrence, Alicia did everything she was told and tried her best to behave. The Lawrences gave her a room, and she slowly settled into her new life.

But three months ago, the Lawrence family suddenly found their biological daughter, Tiffany. But Maria said, ""Alicia is also a child I raised with my own hands. I can't just send her away. Besides, she has nowhere else to go. She is welcome to stay with us.""

At that time, Alicia felt grateful to the Lawrences. She also felt sorry for Tiffany, who had been lost and suffered so much as a child. Because of this, she always tried to be kind to Tiffany. She thought she was gaining a sister, and that they would get along well. But things did not turn out as she had hoped.

From the day Tiffany returned, she was deeply hostile toward Alicia. When Alicia offered her food, she would secretly put laxatives in it. Then she accused Alicia of trying to poison her, claiming Alicia was afraid that she would take everything.

When Alicia gave her clothes, she hid needles inside, then pretended to cry and beg, ""Alicia, I won't compete with you. I just want to stay with Mom, Dad, and my brothers. Please, let me stay.""

The Lawrences saw Tiffany's pleading. They called Alicia cruel and showed even more sympathy toward Tiffany. They already believed Alicia had stolen Tiffany's identity and made her suffer for years. Now they were more certain than ever that Alicia owed Tiffany everything.

Whatever Tiffany wanted, the Lawrences would do anything to get it for her. And whatever Tiffany wanted was always something that belonged to Alicia. One by one, everything Alicia loved and cherished was robbed from her by Tiffany.

2.Chapter 2 Savior
'How stupid I was in my past life, always trying to make it up to Tiffany. Her getting lost had nothing to do with me. Why did I have to be the one to pay for it?' Alicia thought to herself.

She glared at Andrew and said coldly, ""First, I didn't make you lose Tiffany. Second, it was your mother who forced me to come here. She needed a girl around Tiffany's age to ease her pain. I owe Tiffany nothing. If anyone does, it's all of you.""

""There you go again with your tantrums. You know what we can't stand about you? It's this entitled attitude. Why can't you be sweet like Tiffany?"" Andrew snapped.

""Enough. I don't want to hear any more of your nonsense. Just hand over the painting to Tiffany. Once she's famous, I might even let you be her assistant."" He spoke as though he were granting Alicia some great favor.

'What a perfect plan. Making me Tiffany's assistant just means painting for her forever. It's exactly like my past life.' Alicia laughed coldly.

""If that assistant job is so great, let someone else have it. From now on, I won't do anything for Tiffany."" With that, she slammed the door shut.

Andrew stumbled backward, but not fast enough. The door still struck his nose. Rubbing the sore spot, he stared in disbelief. 'Is Alicia possessed? She has always been obedient. This is the first time she has ever refused.'

Then a strange feeling rose in his chest. 'Why did she say no? How dare she? She owes Tiffany everything.'

He kicked the door angrily. ""Alicia, listen to me. If you ruin this chance for Tiffany, Dad will throw you out of the house. You can go back to being a beggar on the street."" Having said that, he turned and stormed downstairs.

Alicia glanced around her shabby room, smiling sarcastically. Since she had joined the family, they had put her in this room and forgotten all about it. 'It's time to go. I've been given a second chance. I won't stay here and be their doormat anymore.'

The room held little that was truly hers: just the newly finished painting, a few pieces of clothing she secretly bought with her own money, and a debit card with her savings.

Throughout her years with the Lawrences, Alicia had supported herself, without receiving even a cent from the family. She bought her own clothes, made her own meals, and was mostly forgotten by the family.

The only time they noticed her was when Maria missed Tiffany and remembered she had a replacement daughter. Then Maria would dress Alicia in pretty dresses, just like the ones Tiffany used to wear.

Staring at the two elegant dresses in the wardrobe beside her own sparse belongings, Alicia laughed bitterly. 'What kind of wealthy young lady am I? Who has ever seen a daughter of a rich family live like this?'

She stuffed her own clothes into a backpack, wrapped the finished painting in some old packing paper and tucked it inside too. After one last look around the room, she knew there was no coming back. Even if she forgot anything, the Lawrences would never let her return for it.

To ensure she had taken everything she needed, Alicia checked the whole room. In the corner of one drawer, she found a brooch. It was shaped like a golden leaf, dull and lackluster, so plain that no one would bother picking it up if it fell on the ground. But Alicia's eyes widened.

She recognized that brooch. In her past life, Tiffany had proudly shown it off to her. It was this very brooch that had made Tiffany become the savior of the Yates family's heir.

The Yates family was an extremely powerful clan. Every member excelled in their field, standing at the top of their professions. George Yates had held a high-ranking official position. Though largely retired, he still carried significant influence in both military and political circles.

George cherished his grandson, Charles Yates, whom he had chosen to lead the family. It was said that Charles had been sent away for rigorous training and forged a strong but cold character. After returning, he took over the reins of the Yates family.

In her past life, this powerful man was Tiffany's strongest backer. Alicia had tried repeatedly to escape the Lawrence family, but was always caught. She even called the police once, only to have Tiffany mock her. ""Even Charles is on my side. Do you really think the police can help you?""

Alicia didn't believe it and managed to call the police. But when they arrived, the Lawrences told the police she was just throwing a fit. The Yates family's steward also pressured the police to stay out of it.

After that, no one listened to Alicia's cries for help. She finally gave up trying to escape. With the Yates family backing Tiffany, she knew there was no way out.

'But why is this brooch with me now? Does that mean it was always mine? I don't remember saving Charles. But it doesn't matter. As long as Tiffany never gets this brooch, Charles will never support her. And without him, I still have a chance to get my revenge.' Alicia thought.

She picked up the brooch, wiped it clean. Now its surface seemed to brighten slightly, revealing a subtle beauty. She pinned it inside her shirt, then put on her coat to hide it completely.

She didn't know whether Tiffany already knew it could connect her to Charles. But to stay safe, she still had to keep it hidden. She couldn't risk Tiffany's bootlickers spotting it and taking it from her.

But she had to wear the brooch today. From what she remembered, Charles was returning home and would pass by this very area.

She remembered it clearly. In her past life, while resting her eyes from painting by the window, she saw Charles's car. It even paused for a moment right outside the Lawrence house.

She needed to go out before Charles's car arrived and let him catch a glimpse of the brooch by chance. She had to make sure he knew it belonged to her. Even if he wouldn't become her ally, she would never let him become Tiffany's supporter.

With everything ready, Alicia checked the time. It was almost the hour when Charles's car would pass by the Lawrence house. She slung her backpack over her shoulder and headed downstairs.

The entire Lawrence family was gathered in the living room for afternoon tea. Archie Lawrence, the youngest son, held up a photo. ""It's not often we're all together like this. Someone's always missing. Look at this family photo. Everyone must get a copy, and I want each of you to keep it in your wallet.""

Just then, Alicia came down the stairs. Everyone turned to look at her, as if suddenly remembering the adopted daughter who lived upstairs.

Adam Lawrence, the third-eldest son, looked awkward. ""Alicia, you're home? We thought you were still at school, so we didn't call you. Well, since you're here, we can take another family photo later.""

Alicia lowered her eyes with a faint smile. ""That won't be necessary. I was never really part of this family to begin with. I won't be in the photo.""

3.Chapter 3 I Owe Her Nothing
Aaron Lawrence, the family's eldest son, frowned. ""What's with the attitude? You hide in your room all day. We're all busy working and hardly at home. Did you expect us to come upstairs and beg you to join us? Why can't you be more like Tiffany? She's thoughtful and sweet. She always comes to talk with us when we get back.""

Alicia sneered. ""Do you think I want to be locked in my room? I have to paint everything Tiffany posts online, even the piece she needs to become Mr. West's student. I'd love to come down for tea and empty small talk, but when do I have the time?""

""Besides, everything I said is true. I was never really part of this family, and none of you ever treated me like one. There's no reason for me to be in your photo,"" Alicia added.

Maria had never expected the always-obedient Alicia to talk back. When Andrew came down earlier saying Alicia was throwing a tantrum, she hadn't believed him. But now it appeared to be true.

'How dare she? She's just a homeless orphan we took in out of kindness. We give her food and a roof over her head. What's so wrong with asking her to do a few things for Tiffany?' Maria thought with rising anger.

Frowning, she snapped, ""We're only asking you to paint a few pictures. Why are you making such a big deal out of it? For years, you've lived as the Lawrence daughter in Tiffany's place, well-fed, well-dressed, wanting for nothing. Do you have any idea how much she suffered out there? That should have been you. You owe her. Is it really too much to paint for her? How can you be so selfish?""

Archie chimed in, ""Exactly. You owe Tiffany this. What's the big deal with painting a few pieces for her? Why are you making such a fuss about it?""

Andrew scoffed, ""She has worn someone else's identity for so long, and starts to believe she's the real young lady. But she's nothing but a cuckoo in the nest.""

Their words struck Alicia as almost ridiculous. She let out a scornful laugh. ""Did I beg to be here? You were the ones who forced me to come here. You lost Tiffany. That is why she suffered. Stop blaming me. I will not take responsibility for your mistakes. I have nothing to do with Tiffany, and I owe her nothing.""

Maria was furious. She pointed at Alicia, her hand trembling, too angry to speak. Aaron put on his elder brother act. ""Alicia, look what you've done to Mom. Apologize now, finish that painting for Tiffany, and hand it over. Do that, and we'll let this go.""

Alicia curled her lips into a faint smile. ""In that case, don't bother letting it go. I won't apologize, and I will never paint for Tiffany again.""

Aaron could hardly believe what he was hearing. As the eldest brother, he had always received Alicia's respect and obedience. She used to do almost anything he asked. But today, she dared to talk back, which made him feel deeply humiliated.

His hands unconsciously tightened into fists. He was about to speak when Alicia continued, ""Since you all see me as a cuckoo in Tiffany's nest, I'll leave. I'm giving her place back to her.""

""You're leaving?"" Andrew laughed. ""Stop playing games, Alicia. If you really meant it, you would've left when Tiffany returned. You waited until we were all here, just to throw a fit and make us beg you to stay, so you could steal even more of Tiffany's moment. But it won't work. We see right through you.""

Archie nodded in agreement. ""Exactly. We're not playing along. If you want to leave, then go. We'd be happy to see you out. Did you really think we'd beg you to stay? Don't be ridiculous.""

Aaron sighed and shook his head dismissively, a look of faint contempt in his eyes. ""Don't make a fool of yourself. No one here is going to stop you.""

Only Adam stepped forward and took hold of Alicia's arm. ""Alicia, that's enough. Apologize to Mom, and we can put this behind us. Look how hard it's raining outside. Where could you possibly go all alone?""

Alicia stepped back, pulling her arm away. ""You don't have to worry about me."" She turned to leave without looking back.

Adam glanced at the heavy rain, which was now streaked with lightning and rumbling with thunder. He reached out to grab Alicia's backpack, his face full of concern.

Alicia was caught off guard, so Adam managed to pull the backpack off her shoulder. He froze for a moment, 'Is this all she's taking?' He stared at Alicia. ""This is all you have? You don't even have an umbrella.""

Archie snorted, a mocking smirk playing on his lips. ""She barely brought anything. She's not really planning to leave. She just wants us to beg her to stay.""

Andrew added with a scornful laugh, his eyes cold and dismissive as he glanced toward Alicia's backpack. ""Even her act is so fake. Disgusting.""

Alicia snatched her backpack back from Adam. ""Everything in here is what I bought with my own money. I won't take a single thing your family bought."" With that, she walked toward the door.

""Where do you think you're going?"" A cold, authoritative voice rang out from upstairs. Alicia turned and saw her adoptive father, Hugh Lawrence, standing on the staircase, holding a coffee cup and watching her with icy eyes.

""To where I belong,"" Alicia replied, her voice calm and her gaze steady, showing no trace of hesitation. Then, without another word or a backward glance, she turned and walked away.

""Stop."" Hugh's cold voice halted Alicia. He descended the stairs, handed his coffee cup to a maid, and settled onto the sofa, his icy gaze never leaving Alicia. ""Don't push this too far. You can't ruin something this important. Is the painting for Tiffany done?""

Hearing his father's question, Andrew grinned triumphantly. 'Let's see if this stubborn girl still dares to act tough now. I can't wait to watch her beg.'

He cut in before Alicia could speak, ""Dad, Alicia said Tiffany's business doesn't matter. Only her own does. She says she owes Tiffany nothing and won't lift a finger for Tiffany anymore. She even wants to leave our family."" He drew out the last few words, emphasizing each word.

Hugh's eyes grew even colder, edged with disdain. 'A stray we took in years ago actually thinks she's above Tiffany? How delusional. Tiffany is my real daughter, the true Lawrence heiress.'

'Let her go. When she can't make it on her own and comes crawling back, we'll have her exactly where we want her. She'll become Tiffany's shadow for the rest of her life.' With that thought, Hugh said coldly, ""If you want to leave, then go.""

4.Chapter 4 Win Over His Sympathy
Alicia said nothing more. She slung her backpack over her shoulder and pulled open the door. A cold, damp wind blew in, chilling her to the bone.

It was early autumn, and Riverdale was in the middle of its rainy season. No one could say how long the downpour would last, but Alicia knew she had to leave now, no matter what.

From behind, Maria called out, ""Alicia, if you walk out that door today, don't you dare come back! Without the Lawrence name, no one out there will even look your way.""

Alicia acted as though she hadn't heard a thing and walked on without looking back. She had no intention of ever returning.

Adam watched the wind and rain raging outside, his anxiety growing. He hurried over to stop Alicia. ""Alicia, it's pouring out there. Where will you go? Just listen to me. Apologize to Mom and Dad. It's better than being out in this storm.""

Alicia, however, reached out and pried Adam's hand away, finger by finger. ""Your real sister is back now. You should focus your attention on her. Just leave me alone.""

Adam stared at his empty hand, momentarily stunned. ""But you're my sister too,"" he blurted out, the words coming out louder and more bluntly than he intended.

Tiffany saw Adam caring for Alicia and even calling her his sister. She felt a sudden surge of anger. 'That Alicia is just a nobody who doesn't even know her own parents. How can she become my elder sister? My brother should only care about me and only love me.'

Jealousy burned in Tiffany's chest. When she saw Alicia walk toward the outdoor pool, a sly glint flashed in her eyes.

She rushed out, grabbed Alicia's arm, and pleaded, ""Alicia, please don't go. I know you're upset that I'm back. You're afraid I'll take your place. But I have nowhere else to go. Can't I stay? I promise I won't compete with you. Please don't leave.""

Alicia took one look at Tiffany's act and let out a cold laugh. ""Save your performance for someone who'll believe it. It doesn't work on me. Once I'm gone, you can put on a show for your precious family. They'll fall for every bit of it.""

After speaking, Alicia tried to pull her hand free. But Tiffany flashed a provocative smile, tightened her grip, and whispered for only Alicia to hear.

""Today I'll show you who the real Lawrence daughter is and exactly who the family truly care about."" With that, she yanked Alicia hard toward her.

Alicia raised an eyebrow. Quick and agile, she was ready to throw Tiffany into the pool. Suddenly, she heard a car pull up outside. She glanced over and instantly recognized the license plate number. With a full set of eights, it was Charles's car.

Alicia changed her mind. 'If Tiffany drags me into the pool and the whole family gangs up on me right in front of Charles, would he feel even a tiny bit of sympathy for me? I still have that brooch, which means I'm his savior. If his savior is in trouble, shouldn't he help?'

'This time, I won't let him support Tiffany. If I can win him over, that's even better. If not, I'll at least show him Tiffany's true colors.'

So she shifted her position, making sure anyone outside could see Tiffany pulling her. Then she let herself fall into the water with Tiffany.

The moment she hit the water, Alicia swallowed a mouthful. She choked so hard that it felt like half her life had drained away.

Alicia had forgotten she couldn't swim. Even though it was only a pool, she felt utterly alone and helpless, as if she had fallen into the open sea.

She complained silently to herself. 'I've lived through nine lives. How come I've never learned how to swim?' Now all she could do was thrashing helplessly in the water.

At that moment, Alicia heard the noise around her, her mother shouting, her father calling out, her brothers yelling, all of them frantic as they cried out for Tiffany. And through the family's panic, she made out a voice she knew all too well. It was her boyfriend, Henry Yates.

Alicia suddenly realized she had almost forgotten she even had a boyfriend. So much time had passed that he had nearly faded from her memory. 'Why is he here? I didn't see him when I came downstairs.'

She struggled in the water, forced her eyes open, and looked toward Henry, only to see him swimming directly toward Tiffany.

By then, Tiffany's brothers were also rushing through the water to reach Tiffany. And if she remembered correctly, Tiffany knew how to swim.

'Typical. My boyfriend would rather save Tiffany than me, and I'm the one who can't even swim. What a joke. But why am I surprised? I've known all along he's trash. I need to see how the man outside in the car reacts.' Alicia thought.

She tried to turn toward the door, but in the water she had no control. Before she could even see it, she started to sink. 'Did I go too far? I never should have jumped in with Tiffany,' Alicia already regretted it.

'Now that no one's coming to save me. I have to save myself.' Just as she was working out how to get out, a large hand grabbed her wrist and pulled her from the water.

*****

The understated modified car was parked outside as usual. Every time it returned this way, it would stop for a while in front of the Lawrence house.

Kevin Quinn pulled over and stole a glance toward the back seat through the rearview mirror. He had been driving for Charles for over three years. Every time Charles came home and passed the Lawrence house, he would stop here for more than ten minutes.

During those ten minutes, Charles never left the car. He just sat quietly, watching the Lawrence house. Sometimes Kevin wondered if Charles had taken a liking to this house.

Every time Charles gazed at the house from the back seat, Kevin would also glance at it from the front. But after looking so many times, he still couldn't figure out what was special about the house. It was nothing compared to Yates Manor.

But today, as soon as he glanced back, he saw a flash of panic in Charles's eyes. Charles's hand went to the door handle, looking ready to step out. Kevin reached quickly for an umbrella, but before he could take it, Charles let go of the handle. He stayed in the car.

'The wind is howling and the rain is pouring. I'm not even sure this umbrella would help. I was worried Mr. Yates would get soaked, so it's a good thing he stayed in the car,' Kevin thought, feeling a sense of relief.

*****

Both Alicia and Tiffany were brought under the poolside sunshade. Maria wrapped her own shawl around Tiffany, her eyes red with worry. ""My precious Tiffany, are you all right?""

Hugh rushed inside and called out to the kitchen staff, ""Prepare some ginger tea, now. Make sure it's hot and strong. We need it right away.""

Andrew gently patted Tiffany's back. ""Tiffany, sweetheart, did you swallow water? Try to cough and get it all out. Just take your time and breathe.""

Archie watched anxiously, rubbing Tiffany's hands to warm them. Even Henry looked on with concern, gently brushing the wet hair away from Tiffany's forehead and tucking it behind her ear.

As for Alicia, only Adam remained by her side. ""Are you okay?"" he asked with concern. ""My clothes are soaked too. Can you walk? If not, wait here. I'll get you a blanket to keep warm."" With that, he hurried toward the house.

5.Chapter 5 Your Stupid Brain
Alicia instinctively glanced toward the door. The car was still there, but she couldn't see inside the car or tell if Charles had seen what happened. 'Why hasn't he gotten out? How else can I show him the brooch? Should I go over there myself?'

Thinking this, she struggled to her feet. She also saw Adam had thoughtfully brought her backpack and placed it beside her. So she picked it up and turned to leave.

Noticing Alicia was about to leave, Henry frowned, stepped forward, and blocked her way. ""Where do you think you're going?""

""Leaving,"" Alicia replied, her voice cold and distant, her gaze fixed somewhere beyond Henry. She showed no intention to explain or stay.

""Leaving? You pushed Tiffany into the water. She's freezing, and you won't even stay to take care of her? Is that how a sister should act?"" Henry's voice was sharp with anger.

Hearing his accusation, Archie, Andrew, and Aaron all turned to glare at Alicia, their faces full of agreement.

Alicia was stunned. 'Did I hear that right? Has Henry lost his mind? Tiffany pushed me in, but no one cares about me. And now I'm supposed to stay and take care of her?'

Then she realized she should not be surprised at all. In her past life, her so-called boyfriend had always taken Tiffany's side without question. She had argued with him about it, but he said Tiffany once saved his life. He even asked Alicia to help Tiffany more, so she could repay that debt for him.

Every time she and Tiffany had a conflict, all Tiffany had to do was cry and act like the victim in front of Henry. Then he would immediately blame Alicia for being ungrateful.

He even used to say, ""If Tiffany hadn't saved me back then, you wouldn't have such a good boyfriend like me now."" So Alicia ended up having to repay the debt he owed Tiffany.

Alicia could never forget the most painful memory. In her past life, after the Lawrence family had locked her up, she managed to escape once. With nowhere else to turn, she ran to Henry, sure that he would help her. Instead, he called her vicious and handed her straight back to them.

To this day, Alicia still remembered his words clearly. ""Alicia, how can I have such a cruel girlfriend? Are you trying to ruin Tiffany? She's an internet famous artist now. If you stop painting for her, what is she supposed to do? She'll be torn apart online and face terrible cyberbullying. She's your sister. How could you do that to her?""

Hearing those words at the time, her heart felt as if it had been torn apart. She broke up with him and tried to leave, but he had his people stop her. In the end, he dragged her back to the Lawrence family himself.

As the memories rushed back, Alicia lost all patience for being polite to Henry. She said coldly, ""Tiffany and I both fell in the water, but all that water must have flooded your stupid brain, Henry.""

It was the first time anyone had ever called Henry stupid. His face darkened. ""You were jealous of Tiffany, so pushed her into the water. And now she might catch a cold. Don't you think you should stay and look after her?""

""Did you actually see me push her? And what is there to be jealous of? Her ugly face? Her lack of talent?"" Alicia shot back mockingly.

Tiffany's face twisted in anger at Alicia's words. 'Fine. The more angrily Alicia acts, the more Mom, Dad, my brothers, and even Henry will take my side. People always pity the weak one. And Alicia is too stupid to play the victim.'

She gently wiped the water from her face with a pitiful expression, her voice soft. ""Alicia, I know you're upset with me, but please don't take it out on Henry. He just feels sorry for me."" Wrapped in Maria's shawl and leaning into Aaron, she looked fragile and heartbreakingly vulnerable.

Hearing Tiffany defend him even now, Henry looked at her with tenderness, and then turned sharply to Alicia. ""You could learn a thing or two from Tiffany.""

Alicia had had enough. She raised her hand and slapped Henry across the face. ""Learn from her? You want me to learn how to be a two-faced hypocrite? Get out of my way. Go be with your little faker. We're done."" Henry never saw it coming. The slap left him stunned.

Tiffany was startled by Alicia's outburst, but secretly pleased. 'This will only make Henry hate her even more. She probably doesn't even realize who he is. Henry is from the Yates family, and he is Charles's nephew.'

A sly gleam flickered in Tiffany's eyes as she rushed to defend Henry. ""Alicia, how could you hit him? If you're mad at me, hit me instead. Don't take it out on Henry."" Alicia ignored Tiffany and walked straight toward the door.

Henry finally snapped out of it. He touched his stinging cheek, his jaw tight with anger. ""Alicia, have you lost your mind? How dare you hit me? Listen. If you don't stay and take care of Tiffany today, I will never forgive you.""

Alicia sneered inwardly. 'What a self-centered jerk.' Without looking back, she reached the main gate and pushed open the wrought iron door.

Adam came out with a blanket just in time to see Alicia leaving. He grabbed an umbrella, rushed after her, and wrapped the blanket around her shoulders.

""What are you doing out here? You're still soaked. Come back inside with me. You need to change and have some ginger tea, or you'll catch a cold,"" Adam said.

Alicia looked quietly at Adam, digging through her memories of him from her past life. Back then, he rarely came home, but whenever he did, he always brought her a gift. Later, after Tiffany started pretending to be bullied every time he visited, the gifts slowly stopped.

Alicia thought to herself, 'Today is Adam's first time back since Tiffany returned. She probably didn't have time to put on her act before I left. That's why he doesn't hate me like the rest. We did grow up together. But so what? In the end, he still hurt me in my past life.'

""Go take care of your real sister,"" Alicia said coldly. ""I don't need your concern. Keep your blanket and your umbrella. I don't want anything from the Lawrence family.""

When Adam saw her push the umbrella and blanket away, he said, ""Alicia, I know you're upset that Mom and Dad made you paint for Tiffany. They were wrong to do that. I'll talk to them.""

""There's no need,"" Alicia said, looking at him. ""And you won't change their minds anyway."" If it were that easy to persuade them, she wouldn't have suffered so much in her past life. Besides, she was sure Adam would soon be swayed by his parents, his brothers, and Tiffany.

At her words, Adam glanced back. He saw his parents and brothers all crowded around Tiffany, fussing over her with worry.

Then he looked at Alicia, who was also soaking wet but alone. A pang of guilt hit him. He knew convincing his parents to stop making Alicia paint for Tiffany would not be easy.

""If you're set on leaving, I won't stop you. But take these and this card."" He pressed the umbrella and blanket into Alicia's arms, then took a bank card from his pocket and held it out to her.

""There's some money on it. Use this for now. I'll send more each month. Don't worry. I won't let you suffer."" As he spoke, he reached up to brush the wet hair from Alicia's face.

6.Chapter 6 A Terrible Sin?
But Alicia stepped back, avoiding Adam's hand. Her voice stayed cold. ""Thank you, but I don't need it. Keep your money and your concern for someone who does.""

Just as she was about to push everything back to Adam, Archie's angry voice carried over. ""Adam, what are you doing? Tiffany fell in the water. Why aren't you over here looking after her? What's so important out there?""

Adam glanced back inside and met Tiffany's tearful, pleading eyes. She looked truly hurt. After all, she was his real sister. He couldn't help but feel sorry for her.

He turned quickly to Alicia. ""Just take these, Alicia. Rent yourself a decent place, and let me know where you end up. I have to go.""

With that, Adam turned and hurried back inside. Following Hugh's order, a servant soon came and closed the gate.

Adam walked over to Tiffany and asked with concern, ""Tiffany, are you all right?"" She clutched her chest, coughing violently without a word.

Andrew grew angry and raised his voice. ""Adam, Tiffany fell into the water and you know she has a weak constitution. You are a doctor, but you wasted time chasing after that ungrateful girl instead of checking on your real sister. Do you even care about Tiffany?""

Adam frowned. ""Why haven't you taken Tiffany inside yet? You know she fell into the water. Why keep her out here in the cold wind? She could catch a chill.""

Andrew grew even angrier. ""We tried to carry her inside, but every time we touched her, she gasped for air like she couldn't breathe. We didn't dare move her again.""

Adam turned to look at Tiffany. As a doctor, her condition did not seem serious to him. ""Tiffany,"" he asked, ""are you really unable to move?""

Hearing Adam's skeptical tone, Tiffany burned with anger. 'What's wrong with Adam? When I fell in, he didn't come to save me. Instead, he went to help Alicia. And now he's questioning me? Is this really my brother? I'll make sure he learns the lesson.'

She looked up weakly, her eyes shining with tears. ""Adam, do you not like me? Do you think I've been stealing from Alicia since I came back?""

Tears started to fall as she spoke. ""I never wanted to take anything from her, or make her leave. I'm sorry. I never should have come back. I should have just died out there long ago. It's all my fault. I made Alicia unhappy, and now I've upset you too.""

She spoke between sobs, looking fragile enough to collapse at any moment. Seeing Tiffany so upset, Hugh, Maria, and the other Lawrence brothers all turned their angry stares toward Adam.

Aaron snapped, ""Adam, what is wrong with you? Have you forgotten Tiffany is our real sister? Why are you taking that Alicia's side instead of caring for your own family?""

Andrew added, ""Adam, you've been away too long. You have no idea how kind and timid Tiffany really is. All she has ever done is try to fit in, while Alicia has done nothing but bully her since day one.""

Archie chimed in, ""Exactly. Adam, you don't even know what really happened, and yet you're making Tiffany feel guilty? That's not right. She deserves better from her own brother.""

Adam was dumbfounded. ""What? I didn't even do anything."" He stood there completely bewildered. 'I haven't done anything wrong. I just asked her, as a doctor, if she really couldn't move. Since when is that such a terrible sin?'

Maria couldn't stand to see Tiffany so upset any longer. She raised her hand and slapped Adam across the face. ""You ungrateful child! The first thing you do when you come home is make your sister cry? Get out of my sight, and don't you dare come back.""

Adam opened his mouth to explain, but Hugh cut him off impatiently. ""What else is there to say? Hurry up and find a way to carry your sister inside. It's windy and raining out here. She'll only get worse if we delay."" Adam felt completely wronged, but he could not say another word.

Seeing Adam's frustration, Tiffany smirked inwardly. 'Serves you right for helping Alicia.' Still not satisfied, she held out her hand to him.

Right from how it causes noise pollution to how they were stuck in traffic due to the Aagaman Miravnuk describing it as the ""worst day of their life""

Or posts about how idols being immersed in water bodies pose a threat to marine biology. Showing quite a concern to the ecology.

They even posted photos of littered streets pointing out the civic sense during the celebration.

All in all, I thought they were being good citizens pointing out the flaws in our celebrations that can cause potential disturbance and harm.

But little did I know it was rooted in insecurity and hatred towards the natives. Insecurity because how dare they take up the streets meant for us?  How dare they get to blast music and have fun at the cost of my peace ? 

Funnily enough, posts like above soon dropped once ""Navratri festivals"" came in. No complaints on blasting Garba music, no complaints about littering or how the immersion of idols are gonna cause a disturbance to marine biology which few days back was ""quite a concern""

The hypocrisy is mind numbing - Do you think the societies hosting Ganpati Celebrations won't have a Navaratri celebration? Yet those voices that were ""quite opinionated"" on the Ganpati Celebrations stay mute on later. 

Our language is already under an attack, our culture is too. We are the last people they want here. The sooner you understand this and vote their masters out - the better.

BJP is their golden ticket to the Power seat in MH and I have noticed them get quite restless when BJP is criticized anywhere. They come in great numbers to defend BJP and convince ""Marathi manus"" BJP is its only option. Ask yourself didn't Uddhav handle Covid quite well? Better than Fadnavis would have?
But they have convinced you Uddhav is an idiot. And BJP our sole savior.

I'm in no way endorsing Uddhav but I do know why they want BJP in power. 

One of them openly told me their agenda - Wait till BJP gets into BMC and see how we rule over you. There will no Marathi or Marathi manus left. 

Wake up and smell the coffee - you have been reduced from majority to minority in Mumbai.
And they're ready to completely push you out, all the while playing the Hindutva card while hating you more than any of the Muslims.

I decided to get it flushed anyways. They showed me the fluid and it was a clear yellow color. 4 days later my step father, went to get it checked again at the first shop with the issues resolved.

1nu0zth,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nu0zth/how_to_identify_the_newest_espresso_machine_models/,How to identify the newest espresso machine models?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts!

I've been a barista for over 7 years, and I've seen countless espresso machines come and go. Recently, I've noticed a lot of questions about how to spot the latest models, so I thought I'd share my insights.

First things first, newer espresso machines typically come with advanced digital displays. Gone are the days of basic LED screens – modern machines feature full-color touchscreens with intuitive interfaces. If you're looking at a machine with a crisp, responsive display that shows detailed information about temperature, pressure, and brewing time, you're probably looking at a recent model.

Another telltale sign is connectivity features. The latest espresso machines often come with WiFi or Bluetooth capabilities, allowing you to control them through smartphone apps. Some even let you save custom brewing profiles, which is pretty neat if you're particular about your coffee like I am.

I recently found some great deals on new models at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. They have a solid selection of the latest machines with all these modern features.

Energy efficiency is another major indicator. Newer models have eco-friendly modes and better power management systems. They'll usually have an Energy Star rating or similar certification clearly displayed.

The build quality has evolved too. Modern machines often incorporate more sustainable materials and have sleeker designs. You'll notice better insulation, which means they heat up faster and maintain temperature more consistently.

One feature I absolutely love in recent models is the automatic cleaning system. It's a game-changer! These systems use specialized cleaning cycles and often remind you when it's time for maintenance.

If you're serious about getting a new machine, check out https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine - they regularly update their inventory with the latest models.

Here's a quick checklist for identifying newer models:
- Advanced digital interface
- Smart connectivity options
- Eco-friendly features
- Automated cleaning systems
- Precision temperature control
- Multiple user profiles
- Programmable brewing options
- Quick heat-up time

I've found that newer machines are actually more user-friendly despite having more features. The learning curve isn't as steep as you might think, and the coffee quality is noticeably better.

Remember, while these features are exciting, what matters most is finding a machine that fits your specific needs. Don't just buy the newest model because it's new – think about how you'll use it daily.

Hope this helps you in your search for the perfect espresso machine! Let me know if you have any questions in the comments.",1,1759198078.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

There’s this guy, who I first noticed around campus. I’d see him in the library, near my classes and the coffee shop I always go to. His eyes always seemed to linger on me, but I told myself I was just being paranoid.

Then I saw him at a party with my best friend Leah (fake name). I asked her if she knew who he was. She said she didn’t, just that he had a couple of classes with her boyfriend and that his name was Kyle (also fake a name). Later at home, I looked him up out of curiosity and realized he followed me on pretty much all my socials, even though we had *never* talked. I followed him back (which I now realize was a huge mistake) just to see if he would message me. He didn’t then.

A week later, he suddenly appeared in one of my classes, one he had never been in before. At this point, I was starting to actually feel uncomfortable. He’d smile at me sometimes, other times ignore me completely. I still tried to convince myself it could all be a coincidence.

I eventually told Leah I had a bad feeling. That’s when she admitted that Kyle had asked her boyfriend for my number. And her boyfriend gave it to him!! Without asking me. I was pissed. I told Leah that wasn’t okay and that I felt creeped out by that guy, but she tried to reassure me, saying Kyle probably just thought I was cute.

A few days later, I got a text from an unknown number:

“Hey Kiki (fake name), I know you’re mad at Chris for giving me your number. I wasn’t sure if I should text you but I couldn’t hold back anymore. I know you always go to (My regular coffee shop), why not meet there tomorrow morning so we can get to know each other? I’ll even pay for your latte. XO Kyle.”

If this had happened without all the weird vibes before, I might have said yes. But I was already on edge. So I replied:

“Hi Kyle, sorry but no. I don’t know you at all and I’d like to keep it that way. I don’t meet with strangers who never even spoke to me. If you came up to me in person maybe it’d be different, but honestly I’m uncomfortable with the stares and with you getting my number behind my back.”

Looking back I could’ve worded it differently, but those were my honest feelings.

The next morning, I went to get coffee anyway. Big mistake. He was already there. I tried to turn around but he jumped up from his seat and cornered me before I could leave. His first words were, “Nice to see you make wise decisions.” I told him I wasn’t there to meet him, just to grab my usual coffee. He talked normally but I could swear there was anger in his eyes. He insisted I “think again,” that he was a ""nice guy"" and I should give him a chance. I said no and left in a hurry. As I walked out, he called after me.

Some people might say nothing “serious” happened at this point, but not taking no for an answer is a huge red flag to me. I blocked his number.

A few hours later, Leah called and said we had to talk right away. When I got to her dorm, she looked upset. She told me Kyle had told her boyfriend that I caused a huge scene at the coffee shop. That I demanded he pay for my coffee if he wanted to go out with me, and when he refused I supposedly cursed him out and stormed off. Basically, he painted me as a crazy gold digger. I was stunned.

I showed Leah the texts to prove what really happened, and thankfully she believed me. But she said all the boys, including her boyfriend, believed Kyle’s version. Kyle even told people that I was following him around everywhere.

From then on, I avoided him at all costs. I skipped classes he was in, stopped going to my coffee shop. I thought things were calming down. Some stupid remarks from the boys were all that happend, until I got an Instagram DM from Kyle (I had stupidly forgotten to block him there):

“Hope you’re not avoiding me babe.” Was his message.

I snapped and messaged him back, telling him to leave me alone and asking how he could lie about me like that. His reply: “Should have had that latte with me.” I lost it and spammed him, called him creepy, told him he’d never get any girl acting like this, then blocked him. I barely slept that night.

The next morning I had to force myslef out of bed and when I opened my dorm room door I almost tripped over something. There was a coffee cup and a bag with a muffin in front of my door. On the cup, in handwriting: “Noticed you’re not getting coffee anymore. See, I’m a really nice guy.”

I crashed out. I threw it away immediately and ran to my dorm advisor to tell her everything and ask how he even got into the building without access. She brushed it off with somthing like *“boys will be boys”* and said it could’ve been from anyone. But now comes the rlly f-ed up part. She said something that made me feel sick: She said that I can’t be the one making complaints like this. Kyle had already gone to *his* dorm advisor and even the police. He told them I was stalking him, harassing him, and threatening him over text. Since he deleted his initial messages, it looks like I just blew up his DMs for no reason.

Now there’s an official record of *me* being the problem. And if I try to go to the police or make a complaint, it’ll just look like I’m retaliating.

I feel completely trapped. He knows my dorm, my classes, and now he even has the authorities believing his side. Leah is the only one who believes me.

I don’t know what to do. Has anyone been through something like this? I feel like if I go to anyone else they’ll just think I’m lying. What do I do?",1,1759197903.0,Advice,8,1.0,False

I went on a date with a guy I met on an app. I thought we hit it off and really enjoyed his company and conversation, plus I think there was a mutual attraction as well. We proceeded to go on a few more dates. Madeout on the 2nd date, and on the most recent one, I spent the night at his house. I thought we had good chemistry, at least it appeared that way. We said goodbye in the morning, shared a couple of goodbye kisses, some coffee, and he even gave me a sweater because I was freezing. He told me to get home safe and after that I didn't hear from him again. It's been a few days and I'm starting to think I'm getting ghosted. I was kind of the one initiating all of our previous conversations prior to this last date, so I thought I would pull back a bit to see if he would reciprocate (especially after we had sex) but he's just been silent. Clearly he must not be interested right? I feel confused and honestly pissed that he can't just tell me that. I feel like I got mixed signals from him especially with how sweet our goodbye was. I'm keeping the ball rolling and have more dates lined up for myself this week, but I can't lie, it's  SO disappointing when you find someone you vibe with just to have them fall of the face of the planet.

We will be staying in Seogwipo and renting a car throughout our journey:

Day 1 - Reach the Jeju airport by 1:30 - estimate is that we’ll be able to leave the airport by 2:30 and rent our car

Once we have our plan is to:

•     grab coffee at Slowboat
•	⁠Geuom Salt Flats
•	⁠lunch at Aewol Cafe Street
•	⁠Handam Coastal Walk
•	⁠coffee at Comma (if feel like it)
•	⁠Innisfree house
•	⁠Osulloc Tea Museum -Jusangjeolli Cliff
•	⁠Chenjiyeon Waterfall

Caheck in by 6-6:30, chill there and get dinner nearby or at the hotel

Day 2 - start early - Olle trail 7

Finish trail by 4-5pm and chill nearby. Would love to go to a spa/foot massage post hike if there are any nearby

Day 3 - need help to plan this day. Given we’re covering quite a bit of northwest on day 1 thought we’d cover the eastern part of Jeju but don’t have anything planned yet so any recommendations would be highly appreciated.

It’s my husband’s and my first trip in South Korea and we’ve already spent 7 days in Seoul and 3 in Busan so already quite exhausted. Would love for Jeju to be more relaxing before we head back to Seoul for our the last 2 days of our trip",1,1759197636.0,koreatravel,1,1.0,False

I will also upload short teaser trailers on Youtube and TikTok to help spread awareness of the game so any sharing is greatly appreciated.

I know how important a community is for a game, and as the person working on it (Only me so far) I want to make sure I engage and listen to you all when you have feedback for me.

**The** reflection of moonlight on the snow brightened the pale spring morning. Mark sipped his coffee while he waited for the morning rush-hour traffic to thin, his car creeping slowly along in line. He hated Fridays. The weekend was so close, but work still demanded his attention. Mark allowed himself a brief moment to imagine going skiing – but let it go. They’d probably call him in over the weekend too.

The road widened to four lanes, and traffic began to move faster. He flicked on his turn signal and merged to the far right, watching for his exit. It came up quickly, and Mark took it, winding down through the trees. He slowed to take a curve.

Mark frowned. Had that guardrail always been missing? He was sure he would’ve noticed before, but couldn’t remember. He glanced down at his radio to check the clock. He didn’t have time to worry about it.

He merged back into traffic and eventually pulled into the parking garage at Hawthorne Claims Group. He took the first open spot he found and half-jogged to the elevator, coffee splashing in his travel mug, resisting the urge to check his watch.

The elevator seemed to be taking forever. He sighed and crossed his arms, leaning against the handrail. The music was far too cheerful for so early in the morning.

Finally, it opened on his floor. Linda, his supervisor, offered him a smile and a wave as she passed by. “Carey brought muffins. They’re in the break room.” Good, he wasn’t late. He lifted his coffee in acknowledgment but passed by the break room doorway. Carey’s muffins were always too dry anyway.

Mark slid into his desk chair and turned his computer on. He checked his watch. Just in time.",1,1759197351.0,KeepWriting,2,1.0,False

* In order to hide the fact that the Whales have three \[Item Box\]-capable mages, Philia devises a ruse by making her fancy clothes chests look like \[Booty Boxes\]. Ingrid's suggestion to acquire actual \[Booty Boxes\] are rejected due to them being rendered useless when exposed to recursive arcane/quantum storage.

**Interlude 3 - 3**

**Onyx and Allium**

**Meanwhile, Jordi’s Dismantling House:**

“*Isekai Swiss vault…*” Neith remarked as surveyed the scene. “*I dig it, I feel like I can recharge my batteries from all the seething and coping those aristo-craps are having ulcers over, knowing there’s places like these where they can’t prey on honest adventurers.*”

“*I know, right?*” Philia grinned as she looked up at the walled compound looming ahead. “*You should see how many NPC’s died to be stepping stones to our path towards sacred privacy, brainlessly stanning for their greedy nobles just to feel safe…*”

Neith played a sound byte of Risitas laughing.

“*Shearing off the lives of sheeple getting in our way is not a cost in any factual metric.*” Neith corrected her, “*The same way you shouldn’t worry about bending a blade of grass when you walk on your lawn.*”

“*True, true,*” Philia giggled, “*I love you Glados.*”

“*I love you too, King Fish*.”

 

""That's close enough!"" The eagle-headed guard squawked as the PLT (Post-Loot Team) drew their carts up to the gates. “By coming to this gate you are asserting you have obtained a \[Letter of Confidentiality\] from your respective Guildmasters.""

The eagle's similar-faced companion screeched in warning.

""Take heed! All forgeries and tampering is punishable by law! Failure to present the \[Letter of Confidentiality\] shall be met with the penalty of forfeiture and a fine!""

While the guard spoke, Siria approached, completely nonplussed, having been familiar with the procedure. In one move, she unpinned her badge with one hand while the other reached into her traveler’s valise to produce the required document.

""Siria Bluethorne, representing Fenrir Guild 'The Whales'."" Siria announced easily, ""We seek a private vault-house for our stay here in Teth-Odin.""

The eagle croaked as he took the proffered items. Touching Siria’s badge to the letter’s seal, the latter dissolved into luminescent smoke while the former began glowing with tiny motes that, if closely examined, matched the sigil of the Fenrir.

\_\_\_

""I've never seen that happen before..."" Neith spoke aloud as Siria held up her badge to the rest of the PLT.

Viel took out her badge and padded over. On contact, her badge glowed as well. The eagle guard’s companion, watching the proceedings, let out a genteel croak upon seeing the badge as legitimate. Peanut had flown in close behind her, and the little mushroom’s badge lit up as well.

Kinu and Kvaris shrugged at Neith’s remark.

""That's how it works."" the sister chorused, looking up at the drone.

""We've seen the procedure before while accompanying the old coot."" Kvaris said as she and her sister unpinned their badges in sync with each other.

""But this is the first time we've had it happen as proper adventurers."" Kinu added as she and Kvaris came forward to tap both of their badges against Siria's.

The pair of eagles caww'ed, the former in seeing the font of the \[Letter of Confidentiality\] glow as a sign of authenticity, the latter in seeing that the Whales' badges had passed muster.

 

""You too Neith, you're sentient, that makes you a guildsman like us."" Philia said as she unpinned her own.

""I’ll have you know a few days prior I went to the library and borrowed books."" Neith said as she opened a compartment from below the Aquila. Her badge dangled out from a lanyard. Motors whirring, she flew over to Siria, effortlessly calculating the velocity and distance so that as she slowed to a halt, the inertia caused the hanging badge to clink against Siria's own.

“Good!” Philia snickered, “About time you touched grass and met people!”

“Maybe when I see more golems walking around.” Neith retorted “The last thing I want to do is scare people! The library at the very least had curious mages, not…” she paused to consider her words “People who might think I'm a wild monster that flew in.”

Philia was giggling as the Aquila drone pulled back, before producing a manipulator arm to pick up the badge and scan it curiously, cameras whirring as the AI processed the enchantment.

""Fascinating. The \[Mana\] flow-patterns are quite elegant."" Neith's voice held genuine intrigue. ""It's almost like...""

Philia snickered as she stepped back, holding up her now-glowing badge ""Isekai hashes, am I right? It's literally analogous to PKI cryptography. That seal on the letter was the outdoor-facing Public Key, and our badges are the Private Keys.""

""That's a lot of convergent evolution going on here..."" Neith murmured, retracting the badge back into its compartment. ""Oh...and what's this?""

 

A stately stork in a more elaborate uniform walked into view, accompanied by a pretty secretary.

The eagles screeched in unison, snapping to attention as the stork strode in.

""Miss Bluethrone..."" the stork's voice was surprisingly deep for a slender man of his frame, ""It seems the rumors are true that you've left the secretary's pen and taken the sword again. Though I did not expect you to return here with a team for your first foray.""

""Praetor Connoir."" Siria nodded smilingly, ""This is the Whales, from my own Fenrir Guild in New Gorpisal. My position with them is permanent.""

The guards, all bird-folk, squawked bug-eyed at what she said. All except the praetor stork who merely let out an amused croak.

""Working with a team now? Your time at the guildstaff got you pushing too many quills I see."" the stork caww'ed in amusement.\_\_\_

While Siria and the stork-praetor were catching up, Neith and Philia were talking privately amongst themselves.

Neith’s camera’s on the Aquila drone whirred excitedly and its lenses tightened as she focused on the pretty secretary.

“Unknown species, what’s that secretary supposed to be?” Neith inquired.

“A Tatuara…” Peanut replied quickly and quietly in awe. “From Iora, no doubt.”

“Iora’s a Principality very far from Veles.” Viel added.

“Tatuara? Wonder if they’re anything like tuataras on Earth.” Neith quipped.

“In a way they do.” Philia replied quietly as well, pretending to gawk at her surroundings like a first time visitor. “They’re a rare ethnicity, really old blood.”

“Interesting…” remarked the Enthana sisters. “Since you mentioned your world only has humans as people, I’m guessing this ‘tuatara’ would be…”

“An ancient breed of lizard found only in one country.” Neith explained. “Our scientists estimate their lineage extends well before humans evolved from monkeys. Even older…”

“I still find it odd that in your world, humans evolved from creatures similar to ixitils.” Viel meowed in disbelief.

Philia shrugged.

“Return to monke.” she chuckled cryptically, holding out a hand. Her grin widened as Viel, not knowing what she meant, happily placed her soft hand on Phiia’s who squee’d and loving squeezed it.

 

Like most demihumans, the secretary the Whales’ PLT were talking about looked a lot like a human being herself. The notable features of her species being her long, scaly tail and a pair of horns that grew from her forehead. These horns were skin-covered at the base before quickly terminating into scales. The eruptions of keratin however, ended abruptly into wooden facsimiles.

“Looks like her horns suffered battle damage.” Neith postulated. “Judging from the even cut, they must have been-”

“Polled.” Peanut squeaked. “That’s something only afforded to warriors as a sign of self-sacrifice and service. Horns are sacred to Tatuaras. When one becomes a warrior, it requires another to cut yours off when you become one yourself.”

“Her false horns are meant to come off easily.” Kinu observed. “This way you deny your opponent any advantages.”

“Even if she kept her original horns,” Kvaris added, “they’re not practical in a fight since they curve upwards and to the back. Unlike a minotaur’s.”

“Not just that.” Philia said. “She’s ex-military.”

“Could be a former adventurer, considering Jordi’s history.” Neith postulated.

“No, ex-military.” Philia insisted ""Tatuaran adventurers do exist, but for the sake of brevity, she doesn’t bear the usual marks. She’s likely an ex-PMC too, which explains why she’s here.”

The girl glanced their way, revealing her eyes to have gecko-like pupils. A light breeze blew her short wavy silver hair, revealing elf-like ears, albeit scaly and webbed like common depictions of sahuagin.

“*Tatuara species archived to Index.*” Neith said to herself.

\_\_\_

“...I have just the vault-house for your group. Come with me please.” The stork concluded.

 

The small courtyard beyond the gates reminded Philia of an airlock. Inside, the detail was manned by sorian guards.

“First the Ishtar Gate…” Neith remarked quietly, “...then Horus guardsmen, a Thoth praetor, and now Sobek inner guards. Looks like we’re in Isekai Egypt or something…”

“Yup.” Philia said.

“Back to what you said earlier.” Neith pressed “How do you know our lizard secretary’s a PMC?”

“Pee-em-see?” Viel meowed softly.

“Private Military Company, or contractor..” Philia explained. “It’s a nicer way to call mercenaries in our world considering the term had colloquially come to mean some bloodthirsty thug who only cares about being paid. As opposed to discharged soldiers looking to make a career out of what they’re good at.”

“For a bloodthirsty world like yours with those WMD’s,” Kvaris snickered, “It’s quite odd your people think poorly of soldiers of fortune.”

“It’s an idiotic irony, I know.” Neith remarked.

\_\_\_

With the door separating them from the outside closed shut, the deep-voiced praetor conferred with the crocodiles for a few moments. Then, with a gesture, the inner gates were opened.

The PLT except for Siria, Kinu, and Kvaris looked up wide-eyed. They were expecting a spacious courtyard with rows and rows of storehouses just like before, with various crewmen and adventurers milling about, carcasses and loot being hauled back and forth, and merchants huddled around to haggle prices over the spoils.

Instead, a wide fluttering maze of crimson canvas bearing the livery of House Whirlpeak restricted the view, allowing the teams of adventurers privacy. They watched as the other groups ahead of them whisked aside the billowing sails while more Horus-like guards stalked the liveried avenue, reminding everyone to mind their business as they prowled around looking for anyone loitering.

“*Wow, imagine that, a place that actually cares about your privacy*.” Neith said privately through everyone’s earpieces, she was observing everyone’s cameras.

“*This is worth burning down our Earth for.*” Philia whispered to her earpiece.

“*Agreed.*” Neith said.

It was like a maze inside as the Thoth-like praetor guided them around twists and turns, and Philia smiled at the irony of the level of security inside. For a man who had lobbied against noble houses forming private armies by holding their spoils hostage, he had attracted a following of loyal warriors committed to protecting dungeoneers’ profits, warriors who once suffered from riches withheld from them or were freed from servitude once the tribunals began hundreds of years ago.

 

“So how do you know that tatuaran secretary’s a PMC?” Neith pressed.

""Diamond Hound to be specific."" Philia noted

“Sounds just about right.” the Enthana sisters chorused.

“Agreed. Although there’s diasporas of tatuarans everywhere else, only the warriors of Iora are allowed that kind of polling.” Peanut explained. “Their culture forbids those who didn’t grow from their mother land to take up arms outside of self-defense.”

“Much less take up a warrior’s mantle.” Viel added. “The Diamond Hounds are Ioran mercenaries that are unique in having a monopoly of tatuaran warriors since they alone have formed a covenant with the tatuaran tribes.”

""The Principality of Ioras.” Philia said. “Isekai Switzerland, if Switzerland' s major source of GDP was exporting military services via their *landsknecht*. We should poach her.""

""Seriously?"" Neith's lenses dilated. ""Also, do you literally mean to recruit her to the Whales, or is this a euphemism for wanting to fuck her? Did you catch hot secretary-itis or something?""

The ex-princess grinned and looked at Neith with a *I know something you don’t* look on her face.

""Ex-PMC now a secretary?"" Philia giggled, ""What does that tell you?""

The AI took a mere two seconds to process various possibilities. ""She left the DH, her posture and movement suggest no signs of having recently harbored traumatic events... of course, my only extensive source of knowledge would be on human psychology. She might have left due to seeing her former workmates do something dishonorable or something like that. Though her constantly wiggling tail might suggest some minor form of shell shock…""

""Yes and no."" Philia grinned ""The Diamond Hounds are a PMC that recruits like the French Foreign Legion. Sometimes have the notoriety of the Wagner Group, with the funding of Blackwater. My guess is our lizard girl outgrew the jingoism and decided the cutthroat life of a soldier of fortune wasn't for her.""

""Philia, we just Saddam Hussein'ed the village of Irons."" Neith reminded her ""I know the decision Ingrid made wasn't in undue haste, but it's not like we can hide this fact from her. What makes you think she will join us once Ingrid tells her about the Sarin strike?""

Philia rolled her eyes ""I doubt she's that uptight, Neith. Besides, you should be asking why I want her in the group anyway. What her contribution is going to be.""

""Another bodyguard for Gwen and Zefir?"" Neith guessed.

""Possibly."" Philia shrugged ""But considering how her tail wiggles a lot, that's an indicator for me.""

""An indicator of what, exactly?""

“I know exactly her previous job.”

""Phalanx Arcana."" Kinu and Kvaris chorused.

""I thought the same.” Peanut said, “Tailed demihumans are typically trained for that role. They carry on their tails a standard imbued with powerful arcana that acts like a summoning staff, freeing their arms to hold a weapon to protect themselves.”

“Her tail's curling around a non-existent staff out of habit,” Viel meowed. “She’s served for a long time.”

“It’s an acquired habit, Neith.” Philia said. “The same way Putin walks like he always has a gun hidden under his jacket.""

""She summons a phalanx?"" the AI queried.

""She conjures one.” The Enthana sisters chorused again.

“A small division of herself.” Kinu chimed in.

“A really advanced form of simulacrum magic.” Kvaris added.

“Let's review our own equipment…” Peanut began, “The Rogue Companion Shillelagh creates a simulacrum of a bludgeoning weapon, a Janus Blade makes a facsimile of your arm and a sword, the Monk Raptor Greaves creates a temporal figure of yourself performing a kick attack... seeing a pattern yet?""

""A progression of simulacrum technologies."" Neith observed dryly. ""Philia’s is the most advanced, capable of generating two of her to serve as stationary fencing guards. I suppose this tatuara is a whole step further up?""

""Way above mine.” Philia scoffed. “Let's lowball it and say it's eight of her across and two deep. Pre-programmed techniques. Unlike the rest of us, her phalanx can march forward, fence with their spears and have good enough AI to stab valid targets.""

The Enthana girls’ tails were wagging as they made quiet, excited canine whines.

""Any limitations?"" Neith asked.

""Each individual pikeman simulacrum needs to maintain cohesion with the others. Anything that manages to forcibly break the formation will undo the spell.” Viel replied.

“Typically, an Ioran *Landsknecht* unit has lines and lines of Phalanx Arcana like her, so the moment our lizard's phantom army breaks she runs off to the back while another takes her place."" Philia said.

Neith was quiet as she ran various optimal scenarios in her CPU.

""How Swiss are these Iorans, Philia?""

""They're allowed to keep their equipment, I already factored it in.""

""How so?""

""The production of Phalanx Arcana Standards are produced by the state, not by the PMC's. PA's are an Ioran staple, just like the Swiss pikemen. They encourage their expat soldiers to keep their standards so the Principality can swing its proverbial dick at everyone's faces. A matter of national pride, you see. If she was dishonorably discharged from service, went AWOL from her merc unit, or had a criminal record, then she wouldn't even be in Jordi's considering their strict hiring criteria. Chances are good she still has them.""

""And if she has them, we’ll take her.” Neith muttered.

 

The Thoth-like stork praetor, Ser Coinnor, led them to a dead-end of massive crimson curtains billowing in the wind. Whisking it aside revealed another gate guarded by a pair of dour-looking Doberman kobolds that looked like Anubis.

“Praetor Kevain…” one kobold said, coming forward. In response, the stork took out a stylized medallion on a lanyard.

“*Praetor Kevain Connoir. Logged”* Neith said quietly.

“Catch.” The stork said, tossing it to Siria who caught it easily.

“That will be your pass to enter this sanctum.” he added, turning around to face the Whales. “You are not to show this to any outsiders, lest you wish to expose yourselves to danger.”

“Understood.” The elf nodded, she turned and handed it over to Philia.

“You hold on to this.” She said, “Between me, and Amaduscia Enthana’s daughters, we can get by without it.”

The stork inflated his crop and warbled in agreement.

“She’s right.” The lead Doberman mused, reading the letter that guildmaster Tibbles wrote, “We recognize you three.”

 

The vault-houses within this inner sanctum resembled terran cathedrals in their grandeur. Inside, grand chandeliers hanging from high vaulted ceilings bore crystals of faerie-lights instead of candles; lighting the spacious interior that would make any glam photographer consider the place heaven. The walls were decorated with mosaics of great battles between adventurers and grand ferocious beasts. Tall statues of Gods of Mercy and Abundance stood resplendent in their alcoves, hands raised in blessing.

It looked excessive at first glance, but the nature of the loot demanded high prices, and attracted attendance of merchants or representatives of equally high standing. That, and nothing helped raise the value than a dead monster lying on the cold stone floor like a sacrifice reserved for the gods than a carcass on a dirty market.

Philia and her group entered to see work crews of trolls sweeping and mopping the variegated marble tiles as priests of the Order of the Silver Scales; House Whirlpeak's religious affiliate, lit incense while singing Gregorian-like chants, further deepening the cathedral-like ambiance.

In many ways, it was. After her rebirth; Philia dedicated several hours learning all she could about the culture of adventuring and learned that many faiths had a Shinto-like regard to the monsters they had felled. Many religions gave honor and thanks to the beasts in some way or another.

Those that leaned towards the more animistic side saw it as just one of the many dances of Life and Death; giving honor to those that died so that others may live.

Other faiths saw these beasts from the Riftworlds as part of an eternal struggle; a sacred duty of Man to uphold the world that the Gods bequeathed to them.

Some religions saw these creatures as embodiments of sin, of chaos, of destruction. Putting them down was an act of personal purification; after all, the only way to defeat such mighty creatures required one to forsake personal pride and petty squabbles and work together to achieve victory.

There was also the aspect of loss. The dangerous nature of dungeoneering exacted a heavy toll on many lives. It was why Jordi the Intrepid insisted his storehouses be modeled after temples, to give thanks to the Gods and give honor to those who laid down their lives for this successful harvest.

As the last of this entourage entered, Praetor Kevain nodded to the Doberman guard. With sharp barks, the heavy doors closed shut with a solemn thud. He gestured towards a set of nearby sofas around a coffee table, where a small team of waiters laid down a spread of coffee and cakes.

“Thank you Praetor-” Philia began, but the stork croaked.

“Ser Kevain will do.” The man smiled.

""Now,"" Ser Kevain began as he sat down, taking a clipboard from his tatuaran secretary ""For your greatest prizes, I have here a list of potential buyers, some of whom can send a representative to make an offer within an hour or two."" He removed a thin booklet from the clipboard and slid it across the table.

“These \[Booty Boxes\] are fake.” Philia gestured at the carts “We’re merely hiding the fact that we have mages capable of using the \[Item Box\] spell.”

The stork smiled and nodded.

“Smart.”

As Philia sat between Kinu and Kvaris to review the booklet together, Viel and Peanut helped themselves to the coffee and cakes. The little mushroom and Citrilan mage made cute giggling sounds as Siria patted their heads affectionately. The two, after all, worked very hard during the escape. Peanut pulsated happily while Viel’s ears wiggled at the elf’s soft touch.

“Help yourselves, you two.” Siria said softly “We need to empty our \[Item Boxes\] later.”

“Mhmm!” The two chorused, leaning into Siria and leaning their heads into her hands.

""Since you mentioned those aren’t \[Booty Boxes\] at all..."" The stork began, turning to the trio of mages ""I'm guessing the \[Item Box\] mage would be Miss Siria?""

""The three of us are..."" Siria replied, ""Also, we have The King Below... I'm guessing our friends there will be willing to wait for a worthy buyer for a carcass of that grade...I imagine our Enthana girls would prefer to secure buyers from Freid.""

Kinu and Kvaris looked up simultaneously.

""I would recommend setting aside two-thirds to be sold in Freid,"" Kinu suggested, her tail swishing in sync with her sister's.

""Friends of your father's?"" Philia queried, scratching behind their ears, which wiggled in delight.

""No,"" Kvaris chimed in ""We don't know where father has travelled to, so we'll write directly to His Majesty King Tulan. I'm confident he'd foot the retainer's fee.""

""This is The King Below after all,"" Kinu added ""...felled with the help of Amaduscia Enthana's daughters.""

""He will buy it."" Both sisters chorused their assertion.

""Well then,"" Philia said, continuing to ruffle the two garms' hair, ""In that case, Ser Kevain, we will defer to your recommendation for the remaining portion.""

She looked around for confirmation. The sisters were leaning into her touch, unconcerned with the remainder. Siria shrugged her shoulders while Viel and Peanut looked back with hopeful eyes.

The stork-like Ser Kevain inflated his crop and warbled thoughtfully. As he looked up the ceiling in thought, it reminded Philia of a swamp bittern trying to blend in among the reeds.

""This King Below…” Ser Kevain said, “...would be some kind of wyrm, would it not?”

“A Lifebane Titan.” Viel said quickly, the stork croaked but kept his bittern-like pose.

“This changes everything,” the stork replied, looking back at the group, “...and shortens the list further…”

On cue, the Enthana sisters looked up at Philia, who hadn’t stopped scratching behind their ears.

“We’ll take your recommendation, Ser Kevain…” Philia said “As a matter of fact, we’ll even go as far as take the offer for whoever profits this establishment the most. On one condition...""

The princess' eyes flitted over to the secretary, who blinked curiously.

Thinking quickly, Siria spoke up.

""Philia here has guessed your secretary is a former mercenary-"" Siria began when Philia interjected.

""Diamond Hound."" Philia said ""...one of the Arcana Phalanx divisions judging from how your tail keeps twitching.""

Her eyes then slid back to the stork-praetor.

""I'm guessing she left her previous job only quite recently."" she continued, ""If you're willing, Praetor, we're willing to recruit her to our team. Whatever fees or severance pay necessary from our earnings from this sale will be spent toward those. As you will see, we've gotten ourselves quite a haul so it will be a very profitable venture for her journeying with us. In addition, we have Siria along with the esteemed Amaduscia Enthana's hand-trained daughters Kinu and Kvaris with us-""

The tatuaran secretary quietly cleared her throat.

""Excuse me, ma'am-""

""Philia will do.""

Ser Kevain merely glanced at his secretary and nodded, encouraging her to speak.

""Philia,"" the tatuaran began ""I don't know what you're thinking of, but I would not consider myself a warrior that could match the Enthana sisters. I am, or was, part of the Arcane Phalanx as you guessed, but my value as a soldier only works when I am with others like me who can form a big impenetrable wall of spears. By myself, my spectral cohort would be easily outflanked.""

Philia waved her hand dismissively.

""Let's just say we have a sort of phalanx of our own. You will be working alongside them. For most part, you will be defending our center group which consists of Siria, our mages, and our supplies. Besides.."" Philia snickered a little. ""I'm sure we'll find some equipment in our loot that you might find very useful...""

Ser Kevain let out a genteel warble, snapping his beak in agreement.

""Go on..."" he said, nodding at Philia.

""You still have time to think it over. I'm guessing we won't be adventuring again until a week from now. if not two considering we'll be heavily investing whatever earnings we make towards bettering our equipment."" Philia said, her eyes turning more serious as she now addressed the secretary again.

“Our next foray will be far more dangerous…back into the Rogue Rift, assuming they hadn’t had it closed yet. We need arcane phalanxes like you, hardened soldiers who know how to hold the line against daunting odds. You will be holding that line ***with us***, you won’t be mere spear-fodder. I can tell you, our leader won’t tolerate that treatment even if anyone us harbored such thoughts. Which we don’t. We need that power of yours, because we'll need to hold our ground while we collapse the rift from within.""

She paused, gauging the secretary and her superior's expressions, both at the very least curious and willing to hear her out.

""Should you join us, then whatever earnings we make from his dismantling house will also be put towards bettering your existing equipment, if not procure better ones. I know that your Ioras-issued standard is yours to keep, but I imagine after parting with the Diamond Hounds you probably had to leave behind any other gear they issued you.""

The secretary nodded, confirming the princess' suspicions.

Ser Kevain leaned back, inflating his crop before warbling in amusement.

""Normally, you come here to lay claim on spoils found in the dungeon. This is the first time I had someone come here to propose parting with one of our own.""

Philia smiled gently, it wasn't a smug, self-assured smile. It was a hopeful one.

""You're right, Praetor."" Philia said, ""I would be remiss to simply court your assistant here without your leave, but I first wanted to gauge her reaction; see if she had the aptitude to journey and fight alongside us. Or, if she was someone who had tired of combat and was simply seeking a quieter life.""

Ser Kevain croaked quietly, nodding at the secretary, who nodded at Philia diffidently.

""Heartviper."" she said. ""Onyx Heartviper...""

""A Sunbasker?"" Siria asked, her eyes lighting up in memory.

""Yes, Miss Bluethorne."" Onyx said. ""The Hearthviper family is of the Sunbasker tribe. My elders have spoken fondly of you.""

The elf scratched her head sheepishly, indicating some kind of embarrassment.

""The matriarch Amethyst Sunbasker told me that if I ever met your acquaintance, I was to relay to message-""

""D-don't... please..."" Siria said, her face starting to get flushed ""Please, make no mention of meeting me for now...""

""What's going on here?"" Neith asked as everyone except Siria started quietly giggling.

Philia opened her mouth to speak, prompting Siria to try to forestall her, but the word that came out left her as puzzled as everyone else.

""Quetzalcoatl."" Philia said.

""Oh..."" Neith’s voice was tinged with amusement.

Everyday I see the same people come by and I see how they interact with one another. But one thing I notice alot and I mean a lottttt is married couples who have kids, normally small babies, and you can just tell that the guy is gay. I don’t like to assume but sometimes , you can just tell right away and it’s common at the church I work at. Today this guy I work with commented on this one particular guy and said that’s he’s clearly in a lavender marriage because the guy is super gay but works in the church and is a well known member. So I looked it up and well I learned what that is. To me it’s kind of sad because I feel like the fear of god sending them to hell has forced a lot of these people to truly hide who they are and force themselves to be with women. I told my friend that I bet a lot of these guys have blank profiles on Grindr. I once saw one of these members who’s married say hey what’s up to this other member (man) walking by and I swear , as the man walked by, he looked at his ass and was checking him out. Just funny when I have also heard them make homophobic comments only for them to be gayer than me. I don’t share my business at this place btw but I’m obviously gay and am only there cause I get payed well. You learn something everyday I guess ",48,1759196827.0,gaybros,19,0.9,False

If you're shy and dating feels like a big leap, don't sweat it. You have a quiet, thoughtful vibe that’s a strength, not a barrier. Here’s some practical advice to ease into dating while staying true to yourself.
Start small. You don’t need to charm a whole room. Try something easy like making eye contact and smiling at someone cute in a coffee shop or saying “I love that band!” if you spot someone with a cool shirt. These tiny moments build confidence without pressure. Online dating is great for shy people since apps like Bumble or Hinge let you think through messages first. Ask something simple like “What’s a great book you’ve read recently?” It’s low key and sparks a reply.
Before a date, give yourself a quick boost. Jot down two things you like about yourself, maybe your kindness or your quirky humor. Have one fun fact ready, like a favorite hobby or a place you’ve been. It’s a conversation starter you can lean on. During the date, don’t worry about silences. Shy folks are often amazing listeners, so nod and ask a follow up question to keep things flowing. If nerves hit, try a slow breath: in for four seconds, hold for four, out for four. It calms you down fast.
Most importantly, see dating as practice. Every text you send or date you go on is a step forward, even if it doesn’t turn into a love story. Celebrate small wins like starting a chat or showing up, not just getting a reply. Shy people often make the deepest connections because you’re genuine and thoughtful. Be patient with yourself, take it one moment at a time, and let your quiet charm work its magic. You’re not just enough, you’re exactly what someone’s hoping to find.",0,1759196795.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

USA or Japan. I would like a Japanese woman who would like to teach me about her language and culture while also build a fun and lasting relationship together!**

Hello there! I'm the type of person who loves to make others smile and feel appreciated. I would like a real, long-term relationship where we can both wanted and accepted for being ourselves. We can start online and see where it goes. 

Pics of me: [https://imgur.com/gallery/pics-of-me-ido4Zc2](https://imgur.com/gallery/pics-of-me-ido4Zc2)

**About Me:** I'm the nerdy gamer but athletic type, like Peter Parker without the spider powers. For me, I'm playful and talkative, but I'm also a good listener who loves to learn. I have traditional Catholic values like kindness, loyalty, honesty, purity, and patience. I believe the best relationships are when you are both partners and best friends.

I’m an honors student going for my Master's in English: Creative Writing. My passion is fantasy novel writing, but I care about physical and mental health. I weightlift, eat healthy foods, and love being outdoors. I also have a deep interest in Japanese culture. I'm studying the language and working toward JLPT N1, with the long-term goal of teaching English there.

**Hobbies/Interests:** 

* Gaming: My favorites are mostly RPGs--Final Fantasy, NieR:Automata, Pokémon, Baldur's Gate, and more! (I have PC and Switch)
* Anime: Dragonball Z, Fullmetal Alchemist, Demon Slayer, etc etc.
* Books and Manga: Check my picture or ask! I have a lot...
* Cosplay (Would love to cosplay with my partner one day)
* Cooking: Mostly pastas and meats are my specialty
* Fitness: Weightlifting and long walks. I value staying healthy and active.

**What I bring to a relationship:** I want my partner to feel heard, wanted, and cared for every day. I'm loyal, caring, and the type who will laugh with you at dumb things. I'd love bookstore or coffee shop dates and relaxing park walks. While online I'd enjoy watching anime, gaming, reading, or just spending time together.

**Who I'm Looking For:** A kind, good natured and nerdy Japanese woman. A girl who shares my values. With similar hobbies to me like gaming and anime, who is fun but also serious about building a lasting relationship.

Appearance matters to me too. I stay fit and healthy, and I'd like a partner who also takes care of herself and is slim to athletic. I'm most wanting a cute face and eyes I can fall for.

I date to marry. I want a woman who's waiting for right person and who values building a bond built on trust, respect, and faithfulness.

**Age range:** 20-30 preferred. 

**Location:** I would want to do Long Distance. I am located in Indiana (EST), but I am willing to date anyone here in America or in Japan only with a long-term goal made.

If you had any questions or just wanted to say hi, please feel free to direct message or leave a comment. Send a picture of what you look like, age, and location. Or have a previous post with those. Thank you for reading, have a blessed day.",0,1759196677.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

1nu0h7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nu0h7g/the_google_ecosystem_going_forward/,The Google Ecosystem Going Forward,"Hey, folks.

I currently have a Pixel 7 and a venerable *Pixelbook* that I've been loving since 2018.

I've read tons of posts from the community lamenting Google's habit of jumping in a new direction only to half-bake or suddenly drop it entirely. Look no further than the discontinued Pixelbook and the tabled tablets.

Some of it obviously had to do with price points and sales, but I think another part of it is Google trying to ""stay nimble"" and predict where things are going to trend over time. I think this is why they've continued to offer the Pixel Fold - why offer a tablet that hasn't sold well when you can offer a phone that *kinda* fills that device gap a bit?

That's where I'm at a crossroads. My Pixel 7 and Pixelbook are hanging in there. I'd prefer to stay within the Google ecosystem (I also have Pixel Buds). Thing is, I know I'll eventually want or need to upgrade my phone and laptop... which leaves me asking *how* to go about it. This isn't me asking ""what Pixel should I buy?"" as much as me beginning to think out loud about where the entire Google ecosystem is headed as a consumer who will have to make purchasing decisions down the road.

If Google announced some kind of new device that was basically a 2-in-1 mashup of the Microsoft Surface and Galaxy Tab: an 11"" super-tablet with a keyboard case and stylus... That you could *connect* to external monitors and use similar to how Samsung users have Dex mode... That could also connect to Smart Hub / Nest docks around the home like they did for the Pixel Tablet... You'd have a pretty powerful ""Swiss Army Knife"" device that you could use as a tablet on the couch, connect to a workstation in the office, and still get more involved work done at the coffee shop or airport. Buy more than one and you could ""daisy-chain"" them as additional workstation screens when they aren't pulling double duty as smart home hubs. I'd say Google should offer a normal and Pro version of the device; the Pro serving as the more capable main device while the simpler devices could augment in lighter smart home and additional screen roles (or serve as a simpler and more economical main device if that's your budget/use case).

Daydreaming aside, that's not where we're at. We have the Pixel 10 series with posts about disappointing battery life and I'm asking myself how much longer my Pixelbook is going to hang in there. It's still trucking along like a champ for now, but that will eventually change.",1,1759196646.0,GooglePixel,1,1.0,False

* Her spending a month ""weighing if she values our relationship more or their friendship more""
* When she finally blocked him, she took a recording of it as proof. But the last 20 seconds were deleted and she insisted it wasn't. Turns out she cried telling him thank you for all he did for her (they had been friends for years but hardly talked since we started dating, aside from recently)
* I asked to message this guy from her phone pretending to be her cuz she insisted it wasn't anything physical and I wanted confirmation (Insane I know but I couldn't believe what was happening and needed ANYTHING to help me).

1nu0eqg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nu0eqg,Save your engine - Clean/Replace your PCV early!,"Just pulled the PCV valve out of my 2021 Subaru Ascent (23k miles only but my fuel economy was getting significantly worse) and gave it a proper cleaning. For context, Subaru had a recall on the earlier aluminum valves that were prone to failure, and mine already has the updated metal version. Even so, it was already not performing great — which means that at just over 20k miles, it was absolutely time to take a look at it.

I decided to clean instead of replace because the newer style valve itself was still in good shape. A few sprays of cleaner, some patience, and it was good to go again. But it's $20 so you can replace if you are at higher mileage and don't want to waste time cleaning it.

Why this matters:
The PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) valve is basically your engine’s little bouncer — it decides which gases get recycled into the intake and which stay out. When it clogs or sticks, all sorts of party crashers sneak in: excess pressure in the crankcase, oil leaks, sludge buildup, and in the long run even turbo and engine damage. Neglecting it is like letting your engine smoke indoors: sooner or later, everything stinks and performance tanks.

Symptoms your PCV might be failing/clogged:
- Rough or unstable idle (engine shakes like it had a bad coffee).
- Increased oil consumption or oil smell.
- Oily residue in the intake tract or intercooler pipes.
- Poor fuel economy.
- Hesitation under acceleration.
- In extreme cases: oil leaks or blue smoke from the exhaust.

⸻

Quick DIY bullet instructions for cleaning/replacing the PCV valve on a Subaru Ascent (applies to many other Subarus with FA24):
- Locate the PCV valve (see the first photo - underneath the intercooler where you can see the disconnected hose)
- Remove the hose clamps and disconnect the hose.
- Unscrew the valve from its housing. See the deep 27mm socket combo that worked.
- Shake it — if it rattles freely, that’s good. If not, time for cleaning or replacement.
- Spray carb/brake cleaner through it until it rattles clean.
- Dry and add thread sealant.
- Reinstall with proper torque — 25Nm (don’t overtighten, it’s threaded into aluminum).
- Reattach the hose and clamps and reinstall the intercooler.

Pat yourself on the back — you just potentially saved your engine from early sludge-retirement.

I’m fairly new to the coffee scene. All I have right now is a three cup moka pot.

‘The Mother of Livestock.’

The decisive day for the subjugation mission arrived.

With all preparations complete, our squad reached the launch bay for the drop capsules.

Below the glass floor of the launch bay, the target planet was visible.

The planet, which should have been blue, was blackened and eroded, consumed by the Chaos.

The darkness that gnawed at the planet's quadrants seemed to be ceaselessly melting and re-coagulating, a sight that brought to mind the mechanism of a cancer or a tumor.

We were about to endure 15 G of gravitational force, plunging in a drop capsule to excise the source of the darkness from within that turmoil.

I took a deep breath and stepped into the capsule.

There, I discovered something odd.

The arrival coordinates were set differently from the operational plan.

According to the original plan, we were to commence the operation today from the outer perimeter of the Chaos, supported by supply units.

However, these coordinates, by any calculation, appeared set to launch us straight into the center of the turmoil.

“Squad Leader, there seems to be a mistake…!”

Just as I opened my visor to protest, the launch began.

―*Woooooooom*

A fierce boom and a body-shaking impact followed, and I briefly lost consciousness.

― Destination reached. Commence operation.

What woke me was the automated female voice echoing within the drop pod.

Confused, I opened the hatch and stepped out.

Immediately, a dense darkness and foul vapor flowed through every opening in my body.

The miasma of Chaos.

The energy emitted by Deep Space entities had begun to invade me.

This substance was what lacerated the human psyche, inducing trauma.

Failure to escape this trauma would cause the collapsed mind to become a conduit connecting Deep Space and the present world, allowing a monster to descend.

Therefore, I needed to lower the internal Chaos concentration immediately.

I instantly boosted my visor's intensity to maximum.

Looking around, I saw several other drop pods. Fortunately, it seemed I was not the only one deployed to the wrong coordinates.

I yelled toward B, who was stumbling out of his pod.

“Squad Leader! Why did we suddenly initiate the operation at this location?”

“Calm down. Calm down.”

Through the visor, he wore a chilling smile.

“To arrive faster than A's squad.”

“You mean…”

“I know exactly where the Mother of Livestock resides.”

He explained that to subjugate the Mother of Livestock faster than A's squad, he had deliberately chosen a dangerous shortcut.

It was a plausible explanation, so I suppressed my dissatisfaction.

He cackled and gathered the squad members.

The squad members followed B’s command with eagerness. Their usual lethargy was nowhere to be seen.

A moment later, we began walking through the Chaos, guided by B.

As the Vice-Captain, I followed directly behind B, which naturally placed me surrounded by the squad members.

B turned, his gaze seemingly licking the squad and then me, and spoke.

“Now, I will begin the briefing.”

The Mother of Livestock.

It was one of the minions of an unknown old god.

It descends by piercing the mind of someone who has consumed a particular meal—a meal of human flesh.

For this reason, cannibalism was treated as the highest crime in the Empire, and those who committed it were summarily executed without trial.

“And… there was an unfortunate accident.”

B spoke with a savoring tone.

“Eight years ago, the habitable planet UB234 was consumed by the Chaos. The Empire swiftly dispatched an evacuation ship. It was an unmanned transport, so we couldn’t send combat personnel.”

Why was he suddenly bringing this up?

“Also, because it was an unmanned transport… we couldn’t be selective about the evacuees. Among those who boarded, there were some who consumed human flesh out of unbearable starvation.”

“…Why are you telling me this story?”

“Listen to the end!”

B shouted violently. It was a cry charged with madness, more than just the anger of someone interrupted mid-briefing.

“When the evacuation ship was halfway through its voyage, the descent began. The Mother of Livestock descended through that person's mind and transformed their body into a colossal mass of flesh. Since there were no agents on the transport… the monster could not be subdued.”

I looked around with an uneasy expression.

The squad members were still pressed shoulder-to-shoulder, surrounding me tightly.

This human barrier, which should have been reassuring, felt, for some reason, like a livestock pen.

“But the Mother of Livestock was benevolent… or perhaps she simply didn’t want to eat unappetizing meat… she demanded only the flesh of one small child. In return, she promised to sleep for ten days. So… a mother offered up her own daughter.”

Despite the horrific story, B's voice melted with ecstasy.

“The daughter was wholly swallowed by the Mother, but… miraculously, the subjugation forces arrived immediately after. So, she survived, undigested. Leaving only a single trace.”

He paused, then spoke.

“They say the child retrieved from the Mother’s gastric acid… had her hair bleached white.”

That child—

I, Renoa Grace, hardened my expression.

That was why I had volunteered for this mission. To put an end to that nightmare.

“…Is this your way of introducing me to the squad, finally?”

I could not fathom why B was bringing up this story in this situation.

“Are you asking me to share my knowledge on subjugation, drawing on that experience…”

“No. No. What I want to know is… well, this.”

B asked.

“Did you taste good?”

“Excuse me?”

“Did the Mother who consumed you… feel sated? Was her expression one of happiness? Was she briefly freed from this terrible hunger and thirst, enjoying bliss? How sweet and delectable was it, that the Mother chose to dissolve you slowly instead of digesting you immediately…”

“…Stop your joking. I will report this to the disciplinary committee.”

“I was on that evacuation ship, too.”

At those words, I froze.

“Not only that, all of us were on that evacuation ship. And, all of us… ate the same thing as the Mother.”

At that statement, I reflexively tried to pull out my gun.

But their movements were faster than mine.

The squad members instantly rushed me, crudely binding my limbs, and B continued his story, his hands clasped behind his back.

“It was just an accident. We were all trapped in an underground bunker for half a month. The only thing we could eat was the flesh of those who had already starved to death.”

“…You!”

“But the Empire would not grant us clemency. So, we decided to throw ourselves into the heart of the Empire. We intended to seize power to avoid punishment. Bound by that secret, monitoring each other, our bond and solidarity were strong and efficient…”

B's voice was drenched in madness.

“And, the deeper we ventured into the Chaos, a certain craving became clearer. That is… the craving for the meat the Mother ate that day. Conveniently, we had… a means to supply the meat.”

He smirked.

“In Chaos, it’s not unusual for one in ten people to die during a mission, is it?”

“You! You mean, all this time—!”

“Yes. We lured in some greenhorn with the promise of a Special Vice-Captain title and enjoyed the feast.”

The sustained 90% survival rate.

This was the secret.

“Ah, but this feast is like Agamemnon’s meal; no matter how much we indulged, only thirst and hunger intensified. Ultimately, we reached a consensus that only one kind of meat could truly sate this hunger.”

A wetness seeped onto my bound limbs.

I knew what it was, yet I didn’t want to know.

It was the saliva dripping from the mouths of the squad members.

“Namely, the child that the Mother ate that day…”

They were trying to eat me.

Their laughter surged up like screams.

After the laughter subsided, B spoke like a sentencing judge.

“Are you familiar with the ‘Paradox of Livestock’?”

The Paradox of Livestock.

The paradox that if the sole purpose of a creature is to preserve its species, then becoming livestock is the best path.

The paradox that a chicken, because it became livestock, might be castrated five minutes after birth, become bone meal after thirty minutes, lay an egg after fourteen days, and be shipped after twenty-eight days—yet the preservation of its species is maintained more successfully than anyone else.

B uttered this paradox.

“If you truly want to preserve the Light… Humanity… must become livestock. After all, the only talent humans possess… is being delicious, is it not?”

“Such rotten…!”

“As a First, I command you: Agent Renoa Grace, become our livestock.”

At that moment, the transformation began.

B’s flesh bubbled and boiled, beginning to shift into the form of the entity I had seen countless times in my nightmares.

A lump of flesh seemingly collaged from maggots and earthworms into a human shape, yet bearing colossal mouths on its chest, arms, and head—

It was the Mother of Livestock.

It clacked its massive jaws and lunged directly at me.

Bound by my limbs, I had no choice but to accept it.

However, in the next instant,

“Th-th-this! I-I-I-I have the r-r-real mouth!”

An anomaly occurred.

Another mouth on the Mother of Livestock moved like a separate creature, interfering.

Its appetite seemed to be competing within the same body.

Seizing that fleeting moment, I managed to break my restraints and pull out my gun.

―*Drrrrrrrrrk!*

A rattling sound like popping beans echoed, and two squad members fell, spraying blood.

Using that break, I regained my footing and barely managed to escape the scene.

B, the Mother of Livestock, only then realized my escape, halted its internal conflict, and screamed.

“Ch-ch-ch-chase! The ch-ch-chicken is r-r-running a-a-away!”

The chase had begun.

  
(5)

― Remaining Ether: 17%.

― Warning. Immediate return to base required. Trauma level rising. Warning.

The visor flashed red, sounding an alarm.

I was wandering aimlessly within the Chaos.

I had no remaining equipment, no means of communication. I was simply moving my feet toward the point where I estimated the last supply station should be, extrapolating from the coordinates I had briefly seen during the drop.

“*Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee…*”

And they were behind me.

They mimicked shadows, pursuing me from behind collapsed streetlights, within half-destroyed slate rooftops, and beneath the wreckage of shattered skyscrapers.

Occasionally, I spasmodically shot at them, but my bullets merely struck the shadows, hitting nothing solid.

They knew.

― Remaining Ether: 13%.

They knew what would happen to me when this Ether ran out.

When the visor stopped functioning, the Chaos would surely burrow inside and collapse me.

Then, they would easily tear at my neutralized flesh like cake.

After endless wandering, they were now employing humanity's oldest method of hunting.

― Remaining Ether: 6%.

Therefore, I had to reach the relay station before that happened.

Even if I died, the fact that B was The Mother of Livestock—that much had to be relayed to the ship.

― Remaining Ether: 0%. Agent, please remove your clothes and cover your body with honey, flour, and salt. Serve humanity.

“Shut up!”

I regained my focus and rechecked the remaining Ether: 3%.

Now, auditory hallucinations had begun to invade my brain.

And then, finally.

I arrived.

I had arrived at the relay supply unit, sitting abandoned on a barren wasteland.

Frantically, I rushed over, picked up the receiver, and made contact.

“Base, respond. Emergency situation. Requesting extraction…”

― Remaining Ether: 0%. Chaos Barrier Visor, deactivated.

― If the Agent is unable to carry out the mission, please commit suicide. The plaque in the Kremlin Palace will remember your human dignity.

At that moment, the Ether concentration ran out.

The vapor barrier separating my interior from the Chaos dissolved, and darkness surged in like a flood.

That darkness played an old voice through the receiver.

― *Daughter, I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry…*

It was the voice of my mother, whose name I no longer even remembered.

The Mother of Livestock had been ceaselessly eating food from the evacuation ship’s food storage.

My mother and I were poor, powerless, and stowaways.

Someone had screamed, demanding to know if she would be thrown off the ship or offer her daughter, and my mother submitted.

She had thrown me, trembling and oblivious, into the food storage.

Confused, I picked up the receiver in the storage unit and desperately called my mother.

At that moment, she had apologized.

She said she was sorry…

“Ah…”

*Clatter.* The receiver slipped from my hand.

This was a symptom of trauma.

It was the trick of Chaos, projecting the most malicious part of my psychological wound to collapse my mind.

I knew it, yet I couldn't escape it.

“Mom…”

The darkness jeered and shook the truth that I had always turned away from.

Until now, I had never resented my mother.

Because, she was my mother.

Because she said sorry, she apologized.

If I hadn't been sacrificed, everyone on that evacuation ship would have died.

Therefore, my mother had not made the wrong decision.

“So, that’s why…”

That’s why I chose 90% instead of 100%.

Everyone under crisis sacrifices a person.

I wanted to believe that.

Otherwise, I would be the child abandoned by her mother.

Unwilling to admit that truth, I chose the 90% survival rate among the two proposals, and that is why I stood here today.

But the darkness within me continued to shake the truth, mocking me.

“I see, I…”

I was abandoned.

My mother abandoned me.

When I woke up on the Empire’s ship, my mother no longer looked for me.

Because it would expose her as a stowaway.

If she didn't look for me, she could live as a citizen of the Empire.

“I… was abandoned.”

In this vast, garbage-filled universe, I was alone.

*Thud.* The strength seemed to leave my knees.

I found myself collapsing, kneeling on the ground.

I couldn’t muster any more strength.

The darkness invading my nasal passages, eardrums, and mucous membranes now felt sweet and soft.

*I want to rest.*

The will to live faded, its vacant space filled by the desire for repose.

I was now completely cooked.

Confirming this, the monsters began to rise in the darkness, cackling.

The Mother of Livestock waddled forward with its massive body.

I should raise my gun and counterattack, but I had no will to fight back.

Perhaps I was meant to be eaten and die that day.

Watching the teeth bearing down on me, I closed my eyes.

― *CRASH!*

However, that fate did not come to pass.

“Captain! You said you had an old-model automobile license! You drove terribly and almost made us late!”

“It was an automatic license! There are classes of antiques! I didn’t know it was manual!”

“Seriously, just drive properly, anyway!”

…Suddenly, a massive dump truck appeared from somewhere and slammed into the Mother of Livestock.

The one holding the steering wheel was unmistakably,

A.

“Alright, A-Squad! Starting now, we commence the subjugation of the Mother of Livestock and the rescue of our comrade, Agent Renoa!”

In the middle of this darkness and turmoil, he shouted with a powerful voice.

  
(6)

They fought bravely.

The red-haired girl maneuvered acrobatics, swinging a long sword along the outer wall.

With every arc of the blade, Ether sparks flew, and chunks of the Mother’s flesh were sliced away, scattering blood.

Staring blankly, I recalled the words I had read in the proposal.

― *First, let me tell you about the girl, Ray. Ray suffered from an intractable disease and was denied treatment, so she enlisted in the military as a test subject.*

― *But now she has overcome that trauma and has become the best sword user in the platoon.*

That girl must have been the Ray described in the proposal.

“Damn it, no matter how much I cut, it never ends! Mika, supply!”

“Yes? Yes!”

At that cry, the blue-haired girl nervously raised her hand. Ether glowed at her fingertips, and a blue liquid poured out, enveloping Ray.

I could feel Ray’s scratches and exhaustion vanishing even from this distance.

― *Mika* *is a child raised in a cult. She was wise and smart, but because she discovered the cult’s contradictions, she was severely ostracized by the group. She didn’t leave her room for quite a while after the military rescued her.*

― *But now she has become a warm child who can heal the wounds of others.*

“Trisa, the decisive blow!”

At that, the girl in red clothes fired dozens of daggers. Her movements were beautiful like acrobatics yet disciplined.

― *Trisa* *is an unfortunate child. Even though her misfortune wasn't her fault, she blocked contact with others for fear of dragging them down.*

― *But now, she is the ace of our platoon, trusting her comrades and leaning on them.*

“Ah…”

Something surged up from within my heart.

The fear and pain they had all endured were no less than mine.

But now, they were fighting the monster so proudly, so fearlessly.

“The firepower isn't enough!”

“Captain, can’t you raise the life core output?”

“The Captain has already raised it to the limit!”

Had I not witnessed this scene myself, I would have thought them reckless. They were 3-star and 4-star agents, while the Mother of Livestock was an Elite. The difference in class was not supposed to be overcome.

But there was something about their fight that made one expect a miracle.

“…”

Slowly, strength began to return to my legs.

The desire to rest receded, and something brighter, more luminous, began to fill my heart.

― *And all these children want to be with you, Renoa. Of course, I do too.*

― *Because we are comrades fighting the Chaos together.*

That feeling was the desire to save them.

Though I hadn't thought of it that way, I was their comrade.

I was no longer alone.

“Everyone, step back!”

I shouted and pushed all my strength into the remaining bullets.

The technique that only a 5-star agent could perform: 'Actualization.'

A secret technique that flips the world’s natural law by exploiting the power of Chaos.

I was attempting it.

My instructor had said this was something only a person who had overcome their trauma could do.

And now, I felt like I could use it.

― *BANG!*

The bullet flew out with a loud roar.

Behind its trajectory, a thorny vine shot up.

It was a vine hung with black roses.

It flew in a straight trajectory like a lance, mercilessly piercing the Mother’s belly.

“*Giiiii-iiiii-iiiii-k!*”

The Mother screamed, twisting its body.

The more it struggled, the deeper the thorny vine dug into its flesh.

“It’s not over yet!”

Next, the second and third bullets pierced the Mother.

Black roses bloomed from each wound, beginning to break down the Mother's mass of flesh.

A moment later, the Mother, having lost its core, slowly collapsed.

Only a handful of blood remained where the monster had been howling.

I had vanquished it.

The adversary from my memory.

I was no longer the helpless child trembling while holding the receiver.

“We… did it…”

A sigh of relief.

And then, my strength rapidly drained away.

The exhaustion I had been suppressing rushed in from the strain, attempting to put me to sleep.

As I collapsed, something warm touched my head.

It was A, who had rushed over and was holding me.

“Renoa! Are you alright?”

…His embrace was comforting.

If I had ever had an older brother or a father.

Would it have felt like this?

In my blurring consciousness, I barely managed one last word.

“Sugar…”

“What?”

“Actually, I take one.”

And then, I lost consciousness.



(7)

…And a week passed.

I can confidently say it was the most chaotic week of my life.

The kids from A-Squad visited my room every single day.

No matter how uninterested I pretended to be, how coldly I spoke, or how much I feigned sleep, those children clung to me and wouldn't be satisfied until they’d chatted for at least three hours a day.

If I ever suffered another trauma, I'd probably develop something like 'chatter-phobia.'

A never showed his face.

To be precise, he *couldn’t*.

The fact that B and his squad were cannibals could have become a massive scandal, and the Empire ordered a complete cover-up. A seemed to be overwhelmingly busy with that task and preparations for his Captaincy.

That’s right.

He became the Captain of this vessel, The Nightmare.

Captain at thirty-one—an immense promotion that would go down in Imperial history.

He probably wouldn't have time to look after a single agent now.

*(P.S. I only learned he was 31 and single during casual small talk. I didn't ask.)*

I subtly and indirectly asked the constantly visiting A-Squad kids about A, but the only answer I got was that the Captain was too busy.

…So, naturally, I couldn't get interested in the small talk.

“He said he’d make me coffee again…”

I hugged my blanket and mumbled to myself.

Did he somehow hear my muttering?

He certainly can't be kept waiting.

That night, A—the Captain—came to my sickbay with fruit in both hands.

“Renoa, it's visiting hours. May I come in?”

“…Come in.”

After quickly checking my bangs in the mirror, I replied deliberately curtly.

Despite my grooming, the Captain's beard had grown even more impressive.

I was so dumbfounded I blurted out a remark.

“Doesn’t that beard bother you?”

“Huh?”

He gave a sheepish laugh, looked awkwardly into the mirror, and replied.

“Was it a bit improper? Should I shave it?”

I quietly looked at the beard and said.

“No, don’t shave it.”

The Captain looked confused by me changing my mind, telling him to shave it then telling him not to.

The Captain sat down next to me.

“We survived that day thanks to you, Renoa. I wanted to come and express my gratitude.”

He was a strange man.

The one who came looking for me after hearing the one line of distress signal I’d managed to send to the supply unit that day was him.

Yet, he spoke as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

He was even saying that *I* had helped *him*.

When I asked him why, he replied awkwardly.

“Why? If I hear a distress signal, it’s a First’s duty to go help.”

So, he completely took his own dedication for granted, but felt compelled to express thanks for the dedication of others.

I was flabbergasted.

How could anyone be this naive?

My initial intuition about him seemed somewhat correct.

“Also, I received a directive from the Headquarters. Since you were technically part of B-Squad, they wanted to issue a reprimand.”

“…Is that so.”

That was expected.

There had been multiple signs that B was abnormal even before the operation commenced. The Empire would naturally be suspicious as to why I hadn't reported it.

“So, I fought with them a bit.”

“…What?”

“I told them that since I shared responsibility, if they reprimanded you, they had to reprimand me too. And that I would resign from the Captaincy.”

“Are you insane?!”

I yelled without realizing it.

This man was ready to throw away a career-defining promotion, one that would make Imperial history, for me—someone he had only met a few days prior.

“…But it seems finding a Captain for this ship is difficult. So, they agreed to just drop the reprimand. Isn’t that fortunate?”

This must have been why he was so busy.

Although he stated it simply, I could guess the tenacity of the struggle that lay behind those words.

“But they attached a condition: that I continuously monitor you, Renoa.”

“I see.”

“So, I was hoping you would work by my side, Renoa.”

I jerked my head up.

Despite being rejected once, this man was offering me a proposal to join his squad again.

“…Are you asking me to join your squad right now?”

“I suppose so?”

He blushed slightly, looking embarrassed, and replied.

I watched his face and slowly asked a question.

“There’s something I want to ask you.”

“If it's something I can answer, I will. Ask away.”

“You’ve relentlessly maintained a 100% survival rate so far. What is the reason?”

At that, the Captain looked surprised.

And the words that came out of his mouth were familiar.

“In the year 2855, humanity lost its home and became a wanderer…”

It was the prayer I had recited before the Empire.

“We do not know the un-artificial sky. What we believed to be God was merely power. The power of the aberrant.”

However, the prayer deviated from the middle.

“Even so, in such a world, humans still pray.”

They bring their hands together and convey a wish, and hope that wish is not one they bear alone.

“…I thought that if God wouldn't answer those prayers, I wanted to be the one who did.”

“…You?”

“I want to be by the side of the person who asks for help. I can't save every person who asks for salvation, but I still want to at least be beside them. When they're in danger, I want them to think, *He’s there, so let's keep going.* That's my wish.”

The words sounded sincere.

The 100% survival rate.

That figure was perhaps nothing more than a derivative result of that wish.

“Will you help me realize my wish?”

…But.

That was tantamount to a declaration that he would sacrifice himself to save even unrelated strangers who prayed.

To want to answer prayers—that is a wish not permitted to humans.

He will be consumed and consumed, until one day he breaks, easily as a lie.

At the end of that road, there will surely be ruin.

100% survival rate.

My conclusion remains unchanged from when I first saw that number until now.

“…Yes.”

…Therefore.

I must stay by his side to ensure that doesn't happen.

That's what I thought.

When I took the hand he offered, the Captain stared blankly at my face.

Had something gotten on my face?

“…What’s wrong?”

“Nothing, Renoa. I just realized you’re capable of smiling.”

“…Was I smiling?”

“And now your face is red.”

A moment later, the Captain was unceremoniously chased out of the sickbay.



(8)

Some time later, the Captain’s inauguration ceremony was held.

Surprisingly, I was appointed Vice-Captain and given the role of standing beside the Captain, waving to the crowds.

…This time, it was the *real* Vice-Captain, not the ‘Special Vice-Captain.’

Apparently, the custom was for the Captain’s spouse to attend the inauguration, but since he was the youngest Captain ever, the Vice-Captain was taking her place, or so I heard.

The Captain was exhausted after the dinner with the Empire’s higher-ups.

But there was still work left to do.

“So, Captain. We need to decide on the ship’s new name now.”

“A new name? Can’t it just stay *The Nightmare*?”

“There’s a saying about new wine in new wineskins. Even formality is important.”

…And like this, I was subtly attempting to mix in some informal speech with him. Fortunately, the Captain seemed too exhausted to notice, letting it pass without comment.

“Hmm… a name…”

The Captain buried his head in his hands.

After a long period of contemplation, he spoke as if he had a brilliant idea.

“Then, how about ‘The Zero Nightmare’? It maintains the *Nightmare* designation and means we’ll reduce nightmares to zero.”

…It seemed he was unaware of the story behind why the ship was called The Nightmare.

I sighed and recounted the vessel’s history.

“Then that won’t do. It’s a name that’s already been used…”

“Why not? The idea itself is good.”

The Captain snapped his head up.

I found him a little endearing sometimes, how strongly he reacted to even minor praise.

“Reusing an existing resource is a good idea from a cost-saving perspective, by keeping the name *The Nightmare*. If the original story prevents us from using ‘Zero Nightmare,’ why not just add one more word?”

“…You’re right? Renoa, do you have one in mind?”

“Hmm… how about this?”

I elegantly etched the words onto a piece of paper.

The Captain stared blankly and read the letters.

“The Chaos Zero Nightmare.”

“It means this ship will become the nightmare of the Chaos entities. What do you think?”

That became the name of our ship.

<The Chaos Zero Nightmare>.

If you are lonely,

If you feel you might succumb to trauma because you are alone,

If you feel like you can’t do anything.

Please, offer a prayer and look up at the night sky.

1nu0bp0,https://v.redd.it/s07ydpzhh7sf1,Amy’s Diary – Coffee Day Video Night,"After we came back from Coffee Day, I couldn’t stop thinking about the wallpapers and Zoe’s confident smile. That evening, while everyone was unwinding at home, I pulled out my phone to scroll. And then—bam! I found a video of Zoe and Coffee Day!

It was so flashy—Zoe brewing coffee, carrying trays with steaming cups, and even posing with the slogan “Life begins after coffee.” My belly gave a big rumble just watching all the cakes and cappuccinos in the background.

I squealed, “Mom! Sisters! Come look at this!” and ran into the living room. Everyone turned their heads as I played the video on the big TV.

Jennifer raised her eyebrows. “So this is the famous Zoe you’ve been talking about?”

“Yes!” I shouted, pointing at the screen. “That’s her! She’s the owner of Coffee Day! Look, look—she’s making coffee like a magician!”

Melissa giggled, “She really does have style. Like she walked out of a commercial.”

Heather teased, “Amy, are you sure you’re not her number-one fan already?”

I blushed so red my cheeks matched the sofa cushions. “N-no, I just… her café is amazing! And… maybe her belly shows a lot too…”

That sent the whole room into laughter. Nina clapped her hands, “Amy, even when you’re watching a café video, you can’t stop comparing bellies!”

Mom smiled warmly, sipping her tea. “Well, Zoe does look like she puts her heart into her work. If the place makes you happy, Amy, then it’s worth visiting again.”

I hugged my pillow, grinning as my belly growled once more. “Next time… maybe I’ll ask Zoe for her autograph. Or maybe a free slice of cheesecake!”

Everyone laughed again, and the night ended with us rewatching the video twice, just because my sisters wanted to tease me.",1,1759196214.0,u_FunRestaurant3384,0,1.0,False
1nu0bmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nu0bmx/my_son_thinks_theres_a_woman_in_his_closet/,My son thinks there's a woman in his closet,"“Mom, Dad! She’s back! She’s back!”

My 8 year old son burst into our room screaming, the door banging against the wall as he dove into the darkness where my wife and I were trying to sleep.

“Richard…” I groaned, voice thick with exhaustion, my eyes still half-lidded. “I’ve told you a thousand times—she’s not real.”

He scrambled straight onto the bed and into Sarah’s arms. She gathered him close without hesitation, soothing him with soft words and a hand stroking his back.

“It’s alright, honey. You’re safe,” she whispered, kissing the top of his head. Then her eyes flicked to me, sharp and urgent. “Mike, can you check Richard’s closet? Just to be sure?”

I rubbed my face, trying to shake the weight of sleep. “Babe, it’s not going to—”

Her stare cut through me, colder than the night air. No words, just a demand.

I sighed, swung my legs out of bed, and shuffled toward my son’s room. We’d done this song and dance at least fifteen times now, and it was starting to grate on me.

About two months ago, Richard had first told us about the “woman” who came out of his closet at night to whisper to him. At first, we were obviously horrified. When I heard his screams that first night, I’d run like a bat out of hell down the hall, flicked the light switch on, and found him trembling, finger extended at the closet door.

I’d ripped it open without a second thought, heart hammering, scanning every corner for any sign of a threat. But of course, there was nothing there—just a neat row of clothes, boxes, and a few scattered toys at the bottom. This time was no different, I opened the closet door with irritation, and apon looking at an empy space once again, I closet it a little bit harder than I wanted and went back to our bedroom.

“It’s all clear, buddy,” I said softly, stepping back into our bedroom. Richard was still curled up in Sarah’s lap, his face blotchy with tears.

“She… she said it’s almost time for me to meet her other children,” he choked out between sobs. “She said you don’t love me, only she loves me, and that she’s my real mother.” His eyes flicked up to Sarah’s face before he buried himself against her chest, clinging to her like a lifeline. “But I don’t want her to be my mommy. You’re my mommy!”

“It’s okay, sweetheart. It’s okay,” Sarah cooed, rocking him gently. “You’re not going anywhere with her, you can sleep with us tonight.”

I tried to catch her eyes, sending her a desperate look that screamed absolutely not. But she wouldn’t meet my gaze, and it was clear I had no sway in this. Sarah curled up with Richard, whispering comfort into his hair as his little body shook with exhaustion. I grabbed my pillow and trudged to the living room, resigning myself to another night on the couch. A glance at the clock on the way out—3:45 a.m. If I was lucky, maybe I’d steal a few hours of rest before the alarm yanked me up for work at seven.

Richard’s night terrors were getting worse. What had started as once or twice a week had snowballed into nearly every night. The constant interruptions, the same routine over and over—I was starting to feel the edges of my sanity fray. We tried everything—night-lights, leaving the door cracked, sitting with him until he fell asleep. For a while we thought it might help, but every night the same thing happened. The screams, the tears, the panicked rush to his room. Over and over. What used to be once or twice a week had turned into a ritual, a relentless routine that left us staggering through the days like zombies.

When morning finally came, I was pulled from a shallow, twisted sleep by the shrill whistle of the kettle. My neck throbbed from the awkward angle of the couch cushions as I pushed myself upright.

Richard sat at the table, still in his pajamas, spooning soggy cereal into his mouth. Sarah hovered beside him with her mug clutched tight, her face pale, eyes rimmed in red. She looked like she hadn’t slept either.

“Morning,” I muttered, grabbing a mug from the cupboard.

Sarah only hummed in response, staring at Richard like she was watching him for signs of something she couldn’t quite name.

“How’d you sleep, buddy?” I asked, forcing a note of cheer into my voice as I reached over to ruffle his hair.

“Fine,” he mumbled without looking up from his cereal. His voice was flat, distant—too old for an eight-year-old.

I frowned. “No bad dreams?”

“I’ve told you, it’s not a dream,” Richard said quietly, but there was a tremor in his voice. “She’s real.”

“Richard, please, it’s not—”

“You don’t listen!” he suddenly shouted, the words bursting out of him like a dam breaking. He shoved his chair back, startling Sarah so badly she almost spilled her coffee. “She’s real! She’s real! She’s real!”

“Okay, okay,” I said, hands out, trying to calm him.

Richard’s small chest heaved. His eyes welled with tears before he collapsed back onto the table, his forehead pressing into his arms as sobs overtook him.

“I should get ready for work,” I muttered, the weight of exhaustion settling over me like a heavy coat. I stormed out of the room, shoulders tense, each step dragging as though the floor itself were holding me back.

 

I shambled into work feeling hollow, the morning’s tension still clinging to me like wet clothes. Every step felt heavier than the last, and the hum of fluorescent lights overhead grated on my nerves. My coworkers greeted me with cheerful hellos, but their voices sounded distant, almost muffled, as if I were underwater. Meetings blurred together; I nodded at things I didn’t absorb, smiled at jokes I didn’t hear. My hands shook slightly as I sipped coffee after coffee, trying to fuel my brain enough to function. By lunchtime, my stomach had tied itself in knots, twisting with anxiety rather than hunger. I was more caffein then man.

The day felt endless, each task a mountain, each conversation a strain. I smiled when someone complimented a project, but it felt hollow, forced. Every text or ping made me flinch—half-expecting it to be a message from home: a new terror, a new scream, a new worry.

By the time the workday ended, I was completely drained, my mind frayed at the edges. I packed up slowly, almost reluctantly, thinking of the evening ahead. Another night, another battle against shadows only I could see. The thought made my chest tighten, but I knew I’d march back home anyway, because that’s where my son was—and he needed me, that’s when I had an idea.

On the way home, I stopped at a local electronics store and picked up a nanny cam. It was a small, unassuming square with a tiny lens in the center, but I knew it could be the key to finally understanding what was happening. After a quiet, tense dinner, I explained the idea to Sarah. She listened carefully, her tired eyes locked on mine, and after a moment she nodded. “It’s a good idea,” she said softly. “Anything to help Richard… and us.”

I passed Richard in the living room. He was lying on his belly, engrossed in a pair of dinosaurs, making loud roars and snarls as he smashed them together. Nearby, a drawing caught my eye. It depicted the three of us—me on the far left, Sarah in the middle, and Richard to the right. But at the very edge of the page, there was another figure. It was taller than any of us, long black hair falling over its head, arms unnaturally long, and a crooked smile crudely drawn across its face.

I clung to the hope that the camera would finally reveal the truth—that it was all in my son’s head. I set up the nanny cam on Richard’s dresser, a perfect vantage point capturing both his bed and the closet in frame. Tomorrow morning, I planned to show him that nothing was in his room, that everything was safe, that we could all sleep easy.

After downloading the app and double-checking that the camera was recording, I got Richard ready for bed. His small hands clutched his favorite dinosaur as I helped him into a pair of blue pajamas and tucked him in.

“See that?” I asked, pointing to the camera as I crouched by his bed. “It’s a camera. It’ll keep you safe.”

“Will she see it?” His voice trembled, the terror behind the words unmistakable.

“I don’t think so, buddy,” I said gently. “she probably won’t do anything. I’ll be watching over you tonight—I’ll keep you safe.”

“Okay,” he whimpered, convinced—or at least trying to be.

“I love you, buddy,” I said, leaning over to kiss his forehead.

“I love you too, Dad,” he murmured, eyes already heavy with sleep.

I stood slowly, careful not to make a sound, and left the room, leaving his door cracked open.

I awoke in the morning, surprisingly rested. Glancing at the clock, I realized it was already 8 a.m. Sarah lay next to me, her soft snores filling the quiet room. I carefully swung my legs over the side of the bed and crept toward Richard’s room.

I gently knocked on the slightly ajar door before peeking inside. He lay on his back, blankets pulled up to his chest, staring at me with a solemn, almost black expression.

“Morning, buddy. Sleep okay?” I asked softly.

He simply nodded.

“That’s good. Are you hungry? I can whip up some pancakes if you want.”

Richard nodded again, he was no doubt heavy with lingering sleep.

“Alright, bud. I’ll let you snooze a bit longer, ill holler when pancakes the are ready.”

I shut the door quietly and made my way to the kitchen.

The rest of the morning passed without incident. Richard emerged from his room about an hour after I had checked on him, absolutely famished. He devoured six pancakes with barely a pause, but he remained quiet, speaking little. After breakfast, he quietly went off to play with his toys.

After showering and getting dressed, I decided to show Richard the footage from the nanny cam. Pulling out my phone, I opened the app and began reviewing last night’s recording. I watched myself lean over his bed, planting a gentle kiss on his forehead, whispering that I loved him, and then quietly leaving the room, the camera’s night vision kicked in, bathing the room in an eerie, pale green light. I fast forwarded the footage a bit, stopping just after midnight.

The closet door creaked open, a thin, almost skeletal hand pushing it aside. On the screen, I saw my boy jolt upright in bed, his eyes snapping to the darkness. Before he could even scream, something surged out of the closet—a tall, impossibly pale figure, its long black hair spilling down over its chest like a waterfall. It wore a torn, dirty, knee high, white gown. The arms were grotesquely long, outstretched as it rushed towards the bed.

In one smooth motion, it clamped a hand over Richard’s mouth, smothering any sound, and with the other arm scooped him up as though he weighed nothing. It held him to its chest, rocking him slowly—almost tenderly, like a mother soothing a frightened child.

My poor boy’s small fists pounded against its chest, his legs kicked wildly, but the thing didn’t flinch. It simply tightened its grip and continued its eerie rocking, staring down at him with hollow, unblinking eyes. Then it carried him off into the closet.

I watched in horror, my stomach twisting with dread, and fast-forwarded the footage. About thirty minutes later, the thing returned, moving silently from the closet. This time, it carried something—a doll, pale and lifeless, cradled in its long, spindly arms.

It set the doll carefully on Richard’s bed, then glided toward the dresser. From a drawer, it pulled out a pair of pajamas and, with deliberate care, dressed the doll in my son’s clothes. A soft, almost affectionate tap on the doll’s head followed, then the figure retreated into the shadows of the closet, closing the door with a faint click.

I held my breath, watching the doll. Slowly, impossibly, it began to grow. Its limbs stretched, its torso lengthened, until it matched the exact height and shape of Richard, even his hair was the same. The doll—no, the *thing*—was now indistinguishable from my son, and a cold, creeping terror wrapped around me like ice.

That thing in my house is not my son. I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Maybe because if I don’t, no one will ever know what happened here. Maybe someone will at least understand what happened to my boy.

Richard is gone. She took him.

I haven’t told Sarah. She thinks Richard’s been quiet today, that he’s just tired. I can’t tell her. She wouldn’t believe me. Or maybe she would, and then she’d go crazy like I am.

I don’t know what to do. I can’t go to the police and tell them a monster took my child. They’d lock me up. Please. Please. If anyone ever finds this—help us. My son is out there somewhere. She took him somewhere. I don’t know if he’s alive or dead. I don’t know if she’s keeping him.

I’m going to try tonight. I’m going into the closet. If I don’t come back… if Sarah finds this… tell her I tried. Tell Richard I’m sorry.

( 1 )

“—Agent Renoa Grace, congratulations on graduating at the top of the Agent Training Program.”

The voice crackled like electric light through the hologram.

I bowed my head to the number ‘01’ written on the cobalt-blue square and offered a humble reply.

“All is due to the Empire’s great fortune.”

“—You are now an officially recognized agent, and you will be deployed on a mission to subdue the elite target designated ‘Mother of Livestock.’ Your preference was prioritized in this assignment, but… its difficulty is high for a first mission. Are you certain you can handle it?”

“It is what I desire.”

“—The reason?”

“…I have a personal history with that entity.”

“—Very well. Then, select the squad you wish to be assigned to.”

Simultaneously, the hologram expanded, projecting two proposals.

These were proposals submitted by two ‘Firsts’—promising Imperial elites and cadet officers—seeking to recruit me.

Normally, the agent was disposable; the First was the owner.

Therefore, this situation, where I, the agent, got to choose my own First, was quite a luxury.

A privilege afforded to me as the top graduate, I presumed.

“—The first proposer, A, boasts a 100% squad survival rate… The second proposer, B, has a 90% squad survival rate. Which will you choose?”

“I will choose B.”

I answered without hesitation.

It was the result of reviewing both proposals, word for word, the previous night.

It was a self-evident and rational conclusion, yet a surprised voice responded.

“—May I ask why?”

“Last night, I reviewed A’s proposal. He submitted it with a handwritten note detailing his squad’s strengths, his expectations, and his reasons for wanting me. And as if already certain I would join, he meticulously introduced each of his squad members.”

…And his penmanship was appalling.

What was worse was the excessive use of correction fluid and white-out, indicating he was fully aware of his terrible handwriting.

If he knew, he should have simply typed it.

“In contrast, B’s proposal was the standard form. Nothing was written beyond the objective figures and metrics.”

I thought this would be a sufficient answer, but the voice persisted with a probing tone.

“—But A’s survival rate is higher, is it not?”

The voice spoke as if there was a compelling reason I must go with A.

“—First A is a talent the Empire has its eye on. His adaptability and command ability are beyond special designation. Look, his squad contained no elites with a ‘Five-Star’ rating like yours. Only a girl who barely scraped by with a Four-Star, a child, and a boy soldier. Yet he brought every one of them back alive.”

“That is precisely why.”

Hearing that, a sigh naturally escaped me.

That such a soft-headed individual was among the Empire’s upper echelons gave me a headache.

“His operation logs were a mess. Every one of those squad members had a record of suffering a ‘Trauma’ and withdrawing from the battlefield in Chaos at least three times. For agents with such weak resolve, one death would be normal.”

No, all three dying would have been normal.

Yet, none had perished.

That meant this First was a person with an abnormal degree of sentimentality.

“Abandoning those who suffer Trauma is the rational decision, yet he did not abandon them. He rescued them, gambling the lives of all other squad members as collateral. That is sheer luck.”

Humans are imperfect; perfection is impossible.

One must sometimes accept sacrifice and relinquish something.

To me, that absolutely perfect 100% survival rate felt like a prophecy of inevitable ruin.

“Such luck cannot continue. Eventually, they will pay the price for all the fortune they have experienced thus far. With a 100% casualty rate and mission failure.”

“—That is an unusual perspective. And what of the 90%? He has lost at least one agent in almost every mission he has overseen.”

“If there are ten agents, one casualty is a normal rate of loss. Rather, to maintain a strict 90% is, in my judgment, a sign of greater competence than a 100% forged by luck.”

“—What if that one casualty is you?”

“If my name can be inscribed on the Imperial Plaque, then I desire it.”

“—Do you regard yourself as merely a component?”

“Yes.”

I nodded my head.

And I recited what we had learned by heart in the Agent Training Program like a creed.

“In the year 2855, Humanity lost its home…”

Earth was overrun by unspeakable beings.

To escape those entities that descend through the tunnel of weak human minds, mankind boarded the Arks.

Adrift in the dark-blue cosmos, we know no sky that is not artificial.

That blue light exists only as data within this Ark.

“…Our mission is to safeguard the ‘Light’ stored within this Ark.”

“—Therefore…”

“If my life can ensure that Light burns for even a single moment longer, I can die smiling.”

“—…Indeed, a top graduate, one every decade, is different. Very well. I respect your decision and will assign you to B.”

“Thank you.”

I finally bowed my head.

Communication with ‘01’ had already been terminated.

The hologram static-filled and flickered, displaying the two proposals.

As I rose to leave the room, my eyes suddenly caught a detail I had missed on A’s proposal.

A small postscript scrawled on the cover.

‘P.S. I like three sugar cubes in my coffee. I heard you enjoy coffee, Renoa. How many sugars do you think is appropriate?’

“…Does he want to get diabetes?”

I chuckled at the absurdity, turned, and exited the room.

  
(2)

The following week, I was immediately transferred to the vessel where A and B were stationed.

The Nightmare.

That was the name of the ship.

*Nightmare.* I thought it was an ominous name for a vessel, which seemed strange.

When I asked a crew member, he wordlessly pointed to the outer hull.

There, the half-destroyed, faint lettering of a ‘0’ was visible.

The original name had been The Zero Nightmare, signifying the ambition to reduce nightmares to zero. However, the previous captain had his mind devoured by Chaos, suffered madness, and ultimately crashed the ship into an asteroid field.

…In the aftermath, the 'Zero' lettering had been wiped away, and so it was simply called The Nightmare.

It was not a very inspiring tale of nomenclature.

I was also told that the Captain’s position on The Nightmare was currently vacant.

I learned that the deployment of the two Firsts, A and B, for the upcoming 'Mother of Livestock' subjugation mission was intended to fill this very vacancy.

The one who won the competition and successfully subdued the ‘Mother of Livestock’ would become the Captain of the Nightmare.

Both A and B were men in their early thirties.

For Firsts, they were practically novices, yet they were competing for a captaincy. Across the entire Empire, there were probably fewer than three captains in their thirties.

If successful, it would be an incredible promotion.

In short, the upcoming ‘Mother of Livestock’ subjugation was a competition with an immensely high stake attached.

Yet, the attitudes of the two Firsts did not, in any way, suggest they were currently engaged in such a fierce rivalry.

Each for an entirely different reason.

  
(3)

There was no discernible zeal in B.

I should rephrase that.

The word *zeal* is insufficient to describe the depth and intensity of his listlessness. He was utterly devoid of the will to live.

The impression I had derived from his career was that of an ambitious, cold, and calculating elite, but the reality of the man was quite different.

When I first saw him, I flinched at the strangeness that emanated from his appearance.

He was terribly thin.

His gaunt cheeks, melted away and rising up to his cheekbones, combined with his nose to cast deep shadows in his eye sockets, and the joints of his bony fingers protruded prominently.

He looked like a man simultaneously suffering from anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and insomnia.

I felt not the slightest hint of the sense of duty or the combat drive that his career should naturally entail.

The only time he showed any spark of motivation was during meals. He would ravenously tear at moldy blue cheese or barely-cooked rare steak.

Then, he would rush to the restroom and retch loudly enough to echo through the entire mess hall.

I suspected that perhaps a series of experiences in Chaos had transformed him into this state.

The squad members I was now to work with were in a similar condition.

They were usually vacant-eyed and lethargic, yet they displayed an extreme obsession with food.

Despite this, the bizarre part was that they were all equally emaciated.

The hunger tormenting them did not seem to be a biological one, but rather a more fundamental, insatiable form of yearning.

…Had I arrived at a bad time?

They might not have been sufficiently healed to accept a new comrade.

They paid no attention to me.

With only one exception: when B introduced me during a meeting.

That day, B introduced me with the title of 'Special Vice-Captain.'

The squad members, who had been sitting vacantly at the table, staring at the cellulose particles floating in the air, instantly changed their gaze upon hearing the words 'Special Vice-Captain.'

It was a spinal, reflex-like reaction, like a dog hearing the word 'Walk.'

I briefly considered whether they were showing caution or jealousy because a newcomer had been assigned to such a high rank as Vice-Captain. However, that was not it.

Their eyes were stickier, seemingly connected to some primal, biological desire.

In their gaze, yes.

I sensed greed.

  
(4)

A was equally as strange.

At the age of twenty, immediately after commissioning as a First cadet officer, he had traversed Chaos a staggering thirty-one times.

Thirty-one times.

As the tragic fates of the previous Captain of *The Nightmare* and First B demonstrated, that amount of experience is more than enough to shatter a human mind. It would, at the very least, turn the world's most fervent optimist into a deep cynic.

Yet, despite all that experience, he was still an optimist.

My first encounter with him was on the bridge, which overlooked the Oort Cloud.

That day, my mind troubled by the strange condition of my new squadmates, I couldn't sleep and took a walk through the ship.

The star cloud, visible beyond the crystal viewport, had swollen up to engulf the Pleiades Nebula, causing starlight to burn with a blue glow across every window.

As I stared blankly at the stellar radiation, something odd caught my eye: a shadow moving stealthily, like a petty thief.

*An intruder?*

The training program etched into my bones had me drawing my sidearm before I could even complete the thought.

Moments later, I had pinned him to the ground with my boot and was holding the pistol to his temple.

“Surrender! Surrender!” he cried out pitifully.

He was a grown man, maybe late 170s in height, about a head taller than me.

He had a certain capybara-like demeanor, and if he’d shave that scruffy beard, he would likely be considered handsome.

He held his hands high in the air.

I maintained a cold expression and interrogated him.

“What was your purpose for infiltrating the bridge?”

“I was working late, and I ran out of sugar for my coffee! I came up to see if there was any left on the bridge!”

“…What? The bridge for sugar? That's ridiculous—ah.”

A thought flashed in my mind.

“…How many sugars do you put in your coffee?”

He blinked and replied.

“I use three.”

He was, in fact, A.

A moment later, I was sitting with him in a corner of the bridge, sipping coffee.

His face, as he handed me the coffee, was beaming with anticipation. He must have been proud of his coffee, as he clearly wanted a compliment.

It was, indeed, good coffee, but I deliberately set my cup down curtly.

“So, when will you tell me the real reason you infiltrated the bridge?”

“I told you, it was for this.”

“Don’t talk nonsense.”

“I thought it was good enough to be convincing. Was it not?”

*I’ll have to try harder!*

He scratched his head and chuckled with a good-natured expression.

“Weren’t you here to steal B squad’s operation plan before the ‘Mother of Livestock’ subjugation?”

“…Operation plan? Why?”

He asked as if he couldn't grasp why he would need to steal it.

“If I’m curious about the plan, I can just ask.”

“…And you think they’ll just tell you?”

“It's for everyone's benefit. Wouldn't they work together? We're all comrades fighting the Chaos—you and me, too, Renoa.”

“…Comrades?”

I was completely taken aback.

This man seemed to have absolutely no concept that he was in a competition with B's squad over the success of the 'Mother of Livestock' subjugation.

It must be because he’s that kind of person that he treats me, the one who rejected his recruitment proposal, without any resentment.

“I see. So, you don’t take sugar in your coffee, Renoa. That’s where I lost points then.”

He nodded and mumbled to himself.

“I’ll keep that in mind the next time I make coffee.”

“There will be no ‘next time.’ We are in a competition. Remember that.”

However, *I* was not so free of resentment. I spoke curtly and stood up from my seat.

I just realized that I left my ring and my watch in my hotel in Osaka:

I’m currently in Tokyo (Shinjuku) and will be staying here for the next few days.

If anyone happens to be in Osaka right now and will come to Tokyo within the next 6 days, it would mean a lot if you could help me pick them up and bring them along. Of course, I’d cover any transport costs and buy you a meal or coffee as a thank you.

Alternatively, if you are in Osaka but not traveling to Tokyo, it would also help me a lot if you could just pick them up from the hotel and send them to my place in Tokyo (I’d cover postage/shipping and any expenses).

It’s a small thing but very important to me, and I’d be super grateful for any help. Please DM me if you might be able to assist.

Thanks so much 🙏

I’ll think it’s mostly boredom but I think part of me has some weird attachment to go to the liquor store and see the employees. I think it’s because I have no friends and stuff. It’s like I miss the interaction of going there and I feel I need to find somewhere else to go, like a coffee shop or something. I think I’m so set in my routines and having that control, getting off work and not going straight there feels too strange. I know being home has been a problem for me too, I don’t want to be home because family problems and stuff. Alcohol was my best friend, escape, and dealing with my feelings and problems are hard. It feels like since I started drinking, I avoided all my problems and now I try quitting and it feels all my problems through the years come out. I feel it’s hard to quit without someone, like I always deep down someone could “save me” and realizing I have to save myself, life isn’t what I thought at all.. there’s a lot of hurt but I just know forgetting drinking wasting my life isn’t the answer.

1nu0859,https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/1nu0859/raised_catholic_exploring_lds_an_update/,"Raised catholic, exploring LDS. An update!","Hi everyone! I made a post two weeks ago talking about how I was exploring LDS. Since that post I attended my first church service yesterday. It was a lot of talk about general conference and things I didn’t quite understand with the passing of your president. It was probably not the best first service to go to, but at least I learned a lot about the behind the scenes work of the prophet. I also was able to see how passionate the members are about the president. I was able to meet some people at their linger longer and saw how generous everyone in the ward is and how diverse it is as well. I did go and meet with the missionaries and a member who converted from catholic to LDS tonight. I will say it’s very easy to talk to everyone I’ve met so far. I continued to ask questions, like why you can’t have coffee. In my previous post I talked about my love for wine and how I didn’t think I could give it up. Since then I realized I did have a problem. The last month I have been drinking everyday and was quite honestly very down. I realized that this past Friday night while I was drunk. Saturday morning I woke up and declared that I’m no longer drinking and that I needed to make it to church Sunday. If I am really going to give LDS a go, I need to follow through with it, and that includes giving up drinking (which I know is no good for me anyway). I am addicted to coffee though and I was open about that being harder for me to cut out, but they were reassuring saying how Jesus Christ knows I am not perfect and it’s okay. I talked a lot about forgiveness and how I am hoping that I can redeem myself in the eyes of God and Jesus Christ. How I am hoping the church will help me become a better wife, friend, sister, daughter. I do think this church can guide me down this path. I wanted a community and it’s clear my local ward has a good one. I will be going to one of the sisters house this Saturday to watch the general conference and it seems to be a higher up member of the church. It’s nice that the missionaries asked if I could join since it will be at her home. The missionaries I have met have been wonderful and I hope they can feel good about the impact they’re having on me. I felt lost in the world, but each day since I’ve reached out about meeting with missionaries, my days have been slowly getting better and better. I know my anxiety and depression will never truly go away, but I also know that I feel better already surrounding myself with these people. I have yet to touch upon the topic of tithing, but I also learned about the three kingdoms tonight so I’m assuming if I don’t do the full 10% I don’t get to go to the highest kingdom. It was comforting to hear that there’s still a chance for people after they die to learn about Jesus Christ and God and have their judgement day. I also liked how what I’ve always known as hell, is called “the outer darkness” to you all. It’s a much nicer way to put it, which I think God would want. My mindset is changing and I’m feeling better throughout this process. I hope to continue to go down this path and gain clarity along the way.

Advice please! *I posted this in another post with pictures if you guys wanna see!*

So I’ve been living here for a month. It’s an ARO. It’s in a really nice area and the apartment has a pool,gym, sauna, and a coffee shop. I love it! 

However the first 2 weeks of me living here the washer stopped working twice. The second time water leaked everywhere. My entrance door scanner didn’t have the cover and it looked broken. There  is some sticky white goo on the door that they couldn’t remove. The window attachment seemed to have been connected with a stringy thing that you close the bread bag with and snapped on. 

The toilet is discolored. It looks like there’s shit under there (or just humidity) 

My AC split unit keeps dripping. 

I’m kinda pissed. Am I complaining for no reason or should I ask for an upgrade? I don’t feel as comfortable here as I thought given that everything is falling apartment. It’s making me feel like since it’s affordable unit apartment they left everything halfway done and just let me
Move in. 


I’m annoyed. 

Thoughts? It’s also my first apartment alone so please help me out.

The maintenance guy is so attentive. He fixed the mirror… he fixed the washer… he put the cover on my door scanner. He came a few days ago trying to fix the window string thing  but I was in a meeting so I’ll probably ring him again some other time. But now it’s these new issues of the AC unit dripping and the toilet that grosses me out

Interview With The Sandman
(A reimagining of Jeff The Killer by Sessuer‘s and GameFuelTv’s)

	He tapped his hand in a rhythmic pattern. The same two taps, then a pause. Three, pause, then two again. He sat, cuffs pinning him to the table, face covered in sparse strands of long dark hair. A line of drool had been flowing from his obscured mouth, collecting on the cold metal, before unceremoniously dripping onto the floor. He breathed slowly, wheezing, like he had smoked since birth. In, hollow. Out, raspy. 

	Detective Simmons stood on the other side of a one-way mirror, watching him. Taking one hand to rub his eyes, he sighed deeply,  then trailed his fingers down to smooth out his mustache. He was a portly man in his 40s, ginger hair covered by a brimmed police hat, tired eyes that never seemed to blink. He stood, slouching slightly, before jumping at the sound of the door opening. 

	“Oh shi-, sorry sir!” Andy yelled into the room as he entered, “I brought the coffee.”

	Andy was a younger man, with a heavily freckled face, framed by curly brown hair that fell on either side of his face. 

	“Jus- just put it on the table, Richards.” Simmons wearily replied, before returning his gaze to the glass. Gingerly, Andy set the cheap disposable cups on the table behind Simmons. He went to stand beside Simmons, his unprofessional hoodie swaying as he turned, as his badge haphazardly hung from his belt.

	For a moment he stood in silence, staring along with Simmons. The silence almost seemed loud, like the air itself whispered underneath each exhale.They stood, watching the man behind the glass, before Andy broke the stillness, coughing aloud.

	“So, who’s he?”

	Simmons didn’t take his eyes off the glass, “He’s an old case - Jeffery Woods. About 20 years back he committed triple homicide on his family, burned their house down, and then three more killed after that.”
	
	Andy broke his gaze to look at Simmons. “So why’s he here then? Isn’t the case solved? Day saved and all that?”

“It might not be,” Simmons replied, “there’s been a new string of murders, all the same M.O.; throat sliced open, with the mouth carved as well.” He rubbed his eye again, still seemingly never having blinked.

“So, a copycat killer?”

“Nah, can’t be,” Simmons sighed. 

“What do you mean?”

“Can’t be, the deaths are too similar. Some of the details that weren't released have been mimicked.” Simmons broke his gaze from the glass for a moment, looking at Andy,  “The witnesses also give a description that’s the same as our guy here.”

“Y’know,” Andy started, laughing under his breath, “seeing him now, he doesn’t look as scary as I thought. Kids used to tell plenty of stories about him.”

“Ugh,” Simmons grunted, turning his head back, “not the sorta thing a kid should be hearin’ about.”

“Well some have tvs playing while parents don’t pay attention,” Andy began, a hint of excitement in his voice. “They hear the news of some killer, and are fascinated with it. Before you know it they’re sharing with other kids, who also share it, and boom - new neighborhood boogeyman.”

“Personal experience, Richards?”  Simmons mumbled, barely trying to be heard.

“Heh, you could say that. We called him ‘Jeff The Killer’. Dumb name looking back on it.” 

As Andy finished, Simmons turned to the table, grabbing his coffee.

“We’re gonna keep this simple, by the books. Don’t let on that someone’s out there killing people. Less he knows, less he’ll hide. Got that?”

Andy raised his hand in a mock salute. “Aye aye o’ captain my captain.”

Simmons grumbled, shaking his head as he reached for his radio.

“Cooper, this is Simmons. We’re ready to begin.”

*
Andy and Simmons sat opposite of him. He didn’t acknowledge their entrance, and just kept tapping on the table. Closer up you could see his breath push his hair forward slightly. He had brought it forward, trying to cover all of his face, though it made the rest of his balding head more obvious. His chest heaved, every breath a focused effort. 

Simmons was the first to speak. 

“Jeffery Woods, I’m detective Simmons, and this is officer Richards.” He spoke clearly, calmly. Like a parent speaking to a young child, not wanting to startle or upset them. 

He continued, ”We just want to ask you a few questions, can you do that?” 
	
All at once, Jeff stopped tapping. His breathing was silent, as he sat up in his chair. His hair fell to either side of his face, like curtains revealing a stage. Rather than a fantastical set piece, a pale, burned face was unveiled. 

He was disgusting, there was no way around it. His skin was pale, almost white, with healed burns framing parts of his face. His mouth was filled with stained yellow teeth, crooked with rotten gums, all clearly visible from his cut mouth and shriveled lips. His slashed mouth was stitched, though many of them had torn and hung loose from the scars. His right eye was a pale brown, the other was long blinded, cocked far to the left. He had no nose, it was long gone. In its place were just two small holes he wheezily breathed from.  He smiled, always. It was hard to tell if it was just his carved face or if he consciously grinned at all times; maybe it was both. 

“I remember you,” he spoke. His voice was gravelly, raspy, like sandpaper across your ears. 

“Yes, I interviewed you a long time ago now,” Simmons said, “we just want to ask you a few questions.”

Jeff cocked his head to the side, staring into Andy. He jumped once his eyes fell on him, and Jeff said, “You’re new… different.”

“Uh, ye- yeah,” Andy replied, almost shaking, “I’m, I'm new.”

Jeff stared for a moment, before turning his head back to Simmons, his neck audibly cracking. His eyes widened, mouth stretching, as he spoke.

“Ask away, Gerald.”

“Please Jeff,” Simmons sighed, looking down at the table for a moment, “Just call me Simmons.”

Jeff just continued to stare at him for a moment, his eye ever so slightly twitching. Simmons looked up, before opening a manilla folder previously under his arm. 

“You remember your mother, right Jeff?”

“Oh yes, I remember,” he began, his voice creaky, almost cooing. “She was just a doll. Kind, calm, but stern. Always worried about her boys, but never enough to do anything for them.”

He gestured at his face, or, at least he tried to with his restricted hands. 

“I still remember when she first saw… this. She was so scared, a great wailing mess.”

“Alright,” Simmons quietly continued, glancing at Andy, who nervously brought his hands away from the table, placing him in his lap. 

“What do you remember about your father?”

Jeff straightened his back as he heard this, 

“Ah, cranky old man. Don’t ever remember seeing him smile. Just always tired from his job, too tired for any of us.”

“Did he ever strike you, as punishment?” 

“No, that would require giving a single damn about his kids. That's something he couldn’t try to muster up.” 

	“Is that why you killed him?” Andy blurted suddenly. Both Simmons and Jeff turned over to look at him, both surprised by him speaking. 

	Jeff chuckled, a sound like a broken exhaust pipe. 

	“You… you’re catching on, rookie. Good head on those shoulders.” He looked into Andy’s eyes, rising in his chair. “Make sure you don’t lose it.”

“Back to your family, Jeff.” Simmons loudly spoke. Jeff looked back to Simmons, and returned to his seat. 

“Yeah, Dad was so unhappy, all the damn time. Up until I made him smile, and smile, and then,” he made the motion of his hand falling down. 

Simmons flipped a page in the manilla folder, tracing his finger as he read. Andy held his hand, coiled in a fist, up to his mouth. Simmons looked up and spoke again.

“You had a brother, right?”

Jeff’s eye widened, “Oh yes. He was such a good guy. Real defensive, always keeping kids off my back. Too bad, too bad he’s gone.”

“He defended you, yet you killed him?”

“Nah nah nah, don’t get it twisted,” Jeff replied, shaking his head. “What happened, he did to himself. Now he’s happy, just like me.” 

“Why, what did he do?” Andy asked, drawn in. Jeff glanced at him for a moment, then just went quiet.

Simmons shot a look at Andy, before loudly clearing his throat.

“Your family was found dead in your home, which had been set on fire,” He began. “We just want to know why.”

 Simmons and Andy waited intently, looking for any changes in Jeff's mood. 

Jeff tilted his head slightly, grunting quietly.

 “They didn’t want to share in the joy.”

“What is ‘the joy’?”

“This,” Jeff pointed at himself, “Is the joy. I;m filled with it. A face like mine knows nothing but smiles, and you can’t help but try and share in the excitement!” 

Andy’s face scrunched up in disgust, like he’d eaten a sour fruit. Simmons simply sat back in his chair, continuing to look through the file.

“I mean, most people refuse, and that’s when I,” Jeff made the motion of slicing his throat, “And then, they go to sleep. I give them a smile, and they’re happy, forever.” 

Andy pounded his fist on the table, shouting into Jeff’s face,

“So that’s your excuse? You killed three of your family because they wouldn’t be ‘happy’ like you?!”

“Richards!” Simmons yelled, standing up from his chair. Jeff began laughing, hysterically. He almost fell back in his chair, but the cuffs kept him leaning forward. 

“Hah aha haha, three? Ahahahahahaaaaa!”

“Now, calm down Jeff,” Simmons started, sitting back in his seat. His voice had become a smooth, calming tone, “I promise Richards will not be upsetting you again.”

He shot a fiery look at Andy, like he was trying to turn him to stone. Andy slumped back in his chair, ashamed.

“Now then,” Simmons continued, “can you tell me about the others you… put to sleep.”

Jeff began settling back in his chair, stopping his manic giggles. 

“Hah, oh yes. Troy, Keith, and Randy. We weren’t on the best terms, different clicks, high school bull, you get the idea. ”

Simmons sat forward slightly, “No, you didn’t.”

“Well it was at a bus stop, and they were acting all tough, giving us dirty looks. We tried told em to fuck off, but they starting getting in our faces. So we fought em’, and we got in trouble for it!”

“Your brother fought them as well, right?” 

Jeff’s ever present grin widened, “Oh of course, but even both of us couldn’t beat all three of them. At least, not until later…”

“What do you-” Simmons was cut off by knocking at the door. He jumped slightly in his chair, before going up to open it.

“I’ll be right back, don’t talk to him until I get back, okay Richards?”

Andy quietly nodded, “Ye-, yes sir.”

Simmons nodded, walking out of the room. Andy sat silently, looking down at the table, trying everything not to stare. Jeff breathed heavily, almost like a happy dog. He stared at Andy, trying to get even a moment of accidental eye contact. Andy tried with all his power to not look back, knowing Jeff's eyes were on him, burning a hole in his head. For just a moment, he broke, and looked back.

Seeing his opportunity, Jeff began, “You’re a detective, right Andy?”

Andy wanted to ignore him, but saw himself answering him. 

“Uh, no. Just an officer.”

“But you wanna be one, right? That’s why Gerald’s bringing you around.” 

Andy shrugged, looking up at Jeff. “I mean, yeah.”

“So tell me this,” Jeff continued, “I have been in here for 20 years, yet someone is out there looking and acting like me.”

“How do you-” Andy attempted, before being cut off.

“But how could that be? Well, let me ask you this, what happens to someone’s fingerprints when they’re burned?”

Andy stood up, backing away from the table as Jeff continued.

“Now, who could look the most like me, who isn’t me?” Jeff continued, staring down Andy while speaking. “Or,,, who could I look like most?” 

Andy had fully backed up to the mirror, his chest heaving in panicked breaths. His mouth was open, gasping for any air. He kept his eyes on… whoever sat at the table before him. Suddenly, he nearly jumped as someone knocked at the door again. He gasped for a moment, leaning over, holding himself up by grasping his knees. His breath returning to him, he walked to the door.

As he opened the door, he saw Simmons standing on the other side. He grinned and opened his mouth to speak, but lost all words as Simmons slumped forward. Andy stepped back, gazing at the knife planted deep in Simmons’s back, before looking up to his killer.

There, standing tall above him, was the face of the real Sandman. Black greasy hair draped down to his shoulders, tangled and unkept. Burns dominated his face, scarred over muscles twisted and warped almost inhumanly, dotted with wisps of scraggly facial hair. A wide, torn smile filled with yellowed teeth. A mere hole for a nose, below two bloodshot eyes, crazed and filled with fire. He wore a dirty and bloodied sweatshirt over his muscled body, above tattered and stained pants and boots.

Andy stumbled back, his breath hitching in his lungs from the sight of Jeff. 

“Time to play Liu,” the killer growled from under his breath. 

With a snap, Andy felt his air ripped from him, as Liu brought the chain of his cuffs to his throat. 

“Shhh,” he hummed, free from his bindings. 

Liu wrestled Andy to the ground, as Jeff took the knife from Simmons’s back.He tried clutching at the chain cutting off his air, but Liu’s strength was too much. He gasped desperately for air, trying with everything he had to fight back, wildly kicking and thrashing. But it was no use.

As the life left his lungs, the last thing Andy saw was the real Jeffery Woods bring a knife to his mouth. The man once cuffed to the table was never the Woods Killer, just his brother, a 20 year decoy. He felt the knife pierce his flesh, slitting open his mouth, as the real Jeff whispered.

Which isn't actually a huge deal, I'm really not insecure about my weight or appearance (although it has taken some getting used to), but I do want to lose weight simply for the sake of being healthy and fitting into my old pants (its been hell trying to buy new jeans in my size).

I'm going to try to start eating healthier tomorrow (I should say, I am *going* to start eating healthier tomorrow). Cutting back on the desserts (maybe entirely just by finding a fruit alternative– I know iced coffee is around 300cals alone and is probably the primary culprit behind my acne breakouts) and eating more protein and fiber should probably help. I'm not going to calorie count, I'm afraid I'll fall back into old, unhealthy habits where I almost lost my period.

I walk a lot already (around 10k steps a day) because I have to for college. But that's about all the exercise I get.

It hurts for me to walk sometimes. I'm not talking only long distances (I actually walked 80 minutes yesterday across the city and back). I'm talking only when I have to walk fast or walk upwards. The pain in my calves can get excruciating if I don't stop and I've even collapsed from it before. There's days where I'm walking back from class and it just hurts. Typically not to the point of collapsing, though.

I have ADHD and schizoaffective disorder, and both of those eat up a good chunk of my day. If it's not those two, it's class and homework and chores.

I'm also always just really tired. I get enough sleep, I'm just... tired. I think it's more depression than anything.

What's a good exercise to lose weight? I'm not really looking to increase a lot of muscle (other than maybe in my arms, which the flabbiness and weakness of has always bothered me). I'm willing to go to the gym for maybe about an hour every other day to start. It might take me a minute to get into the groove of things. I really struggle to take care of myself overall.

edit: Oh, I should probably mention I'd like to lose around 30 to 40lbs in about 8 months (so around next May, I'd like to be around the 115-125 range starting from the 155-160lbs range). Which, if I'm correct, should be doable.",0,1759195715.0,WeightLossAdvice,11,0.5,False

1nu02gp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nu02gp,This is my first studio apartment. Should I be concerned  or is this normal?,"Advice please! 

So I’ve been living here for a month. It’s an affordable unit studio. It’s in a really nice area and the apartment has a pool,gym, sauna, and a coffee shop. I love it! 

However the first 2 weeks of me living here the washer stopped working twice. The second time water leaked everywhere. My entrance door didn’t have the cover and it was uncovered as shown in the picture. There is some sticky goo on the door that they couldn’t remove. The window attachment seemed to have been connected with a stringy thing and snapped (see pics). The toilet is discolored. My AC split unit keeps dripping. 

I’m kinda pissed. Am I complaining for no reason or should I ask for an upgrade? I don’t feel as comfortable here as I thought given that everything is falling apartment. It’s making me feel like since it’s affordable unit apartment they left everything halfway done and just let me
Move in. 


I’m annoyed. 

Thoughts? It’s also my first apartment alone so please bear with me. 

The maintenance guy is so attentive. He fixed the mirror… he fixed the washer… he put the cover on my door scanner. He came a few days ago trying to fix the window string thing  but I was in a meeting so I’ll probably ring him again some other time. But now it’s these new issues of the AC unit dripping and the toilet that grosses me out

I met this girl start of this year, let's call her Ash. She is Asian, conservative background. I am a grad student couple of years older she is an undergrad in her third year.

We were assigned to the same group for a project. She knew from the start how old I was, that's why I mentioned not needing a speech on age gaps. Despite that she decided to get the ball rolling. Over twelve weeks we grew close, flirting, teasing etc. She wasn't my type initially but we just clicked and before I knew it I fell for her.

I eventually made a move, didn't want to waste time wondering what-if. So she claimed she had a boyfriend. I respected the boundary and pulled away. But part of me didn't believe her and a mutual friend confirmed she lied. I didn't push I just walked away quietly.

She started spiraling after that, her effort on the project dropped, and she  sabotaged the project, which if not for my effort we might have failed. 

We went into summer break maintaining no contact. I was pretty sure we would both move on but over summer I noticed some weirdness. Like fake accounts kept following me on socials, with Asian girl names. I initially assumed they were bots but one day I decided to tighten my privacy setting on fb and whoever had added me saw it and deleted their account.

We return to campus and somehow end up sharing another class again. She tried playing the same game as she did last semester, but I shut it down immediately. Pretty much made it clear that I like her but I wouldn't waste my time on stupid games. There was a lot more to the text, too long to write here but the text was enough to cause her to spiral again.

So the issue for both of us is that she clearly still has feelings but keeps expecting me to make every single move. Even though my last message made it clear the onus was on her if she wanted to continue something she keeps doing things which make it clear she wants me to break the tension her own lie created. 

She keeps staring at me in class, following me out of the room but not speaking, looking at me with sad eyes, running from the class or skipping, which I know isn't like her. 

The issue for me is yes I do like her but I'm looking for someone who can be my equal not someone who expects me to do the heavy lifting emotionally. 

And part of me worries that if I do break the silence first she'll feel validated and friendzone me due to her own confusion. 

I keep getting tempted to break the silence but it seems like a bad idea. Has anyone been in a similar situation or even knows what to do?

It's not just me she's avoiding even her friends seem worried about her. I've just never seen someone spiral this much over a simple coffee ask and don't know how to deal with it.

My husband and I are heading to Puerto Rico in December as my brother will be playing for the Criollos de Caguas, so we’ll need to get to Caguas sometimes.

Some things we’re trying to figure out — would love your suggestions:

**Where to Stay**

* Neighborhoods in or around San Juan that balance beach access + nightlife + restaurants
* Somewhere from which Uber to Caguas is reasonable
* Hotels, Airbnbs, guesthouses — all options welcome

**What to Do / See**

* Beach spots you’d recommend
* Day trips or lesser-known gems (rainforest, waterfalls, islands, etc.)
* Cultural stuff, hikes, local markets, nightlife

**Food & Drink**

* Local joints you love (for breakfast, lunch, dinner)
* Street food / casual eats
* Dessert, coffee, cocktails

**Transport & Getting Around**

* Do you think we should rent a car (for flexibility) or rely on Ubers / local transit?
* Car rental tips (insurance, which companies, pitfalls)
* Any “must-know” about getting between San Juan and Caguas, or to beaches

1. The Sleep: No more waking up at 3:30am sweating while literally praying my day ahead will be okay. I wake up with a grander purpose; one other than just surviving the day ahead. Night time rituals and quality sleep is luxurious.

2. The Glow: when you’re always hungover, your drive to do things to boost your physical appearance are nonexistent. I’m vain in my older years. The brightness and sparkle in my eyes are an added bonus. Alcohol makes you ugly. Sober is sexy.  

3. The Motivation: if you’re strong enough to get to 5 alcohol free days, you’re strong enough for anything. Chores are easier, my house is cleaner, I plan healthy meals, and my dogs are properly walked. Losing weight and toning my body at the gym is no longer something I dread, but rather quite enjoy. My life is better without the booze.

4. The Mornings : A fresh faced morning sans shame is a privilege. Remembering your previous night is pretty wonderful. Early mornings are my favorite as of late.  **Cheers.. with coffee. 

5. Anxiety: Drinking wasn’t the cure to my anxiety, it was the main contributor. My brain’s GABA function is no longer disrupted. Without alcohol I am calm, cool, and collect. Perhaps too chill 😅

6. Money: Wine, even when offered in a box, adds up. My self care budget has certainly increased. (As covered in 2., I am vain 🧖🏻‍♀️💄🛁💉)

7. The Memory: Forgotten nights are a thing of the past. I remember conversations, key updates, plan making, and so much more.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

—————

Call me Mr. Dalloway. I said I would buy the flowers myself. Just kidding, what I actually said was that if I ever get the chance to meet the founder of Sidephone, I‘d take it. Given the fact that I‘m autistic and not a traveller, this seemed the odds were against me until life decided it would send u/chrisristovski on a tour around Europe.

I knew for sure that attending the meetup Chris arranged for people interested in Sidephone would be overwhelming for me in many different aspects, but I was determined not to give up that easily. So I reached out to him, and I couldn‘t be happier when he responded very kindly and got out of his way for me to meet 1:1 in person despite his busy schedule.

Following the Sidephone project quite from the very start as they became visible on Reddit, I already had a gut feeling of Chris being a kind and authentic person according to the way he wrote his posts and behaved in the video updates, but you only recognise the true character of a person when you see how they treat service personnel, the poor, women, children, and the vulnerable minorities of a society and people in need.

So when he accommodated me as a multiple handicapped person, Chris instantly „had a stone in my plank“ as we call it in German. I think this translates to he was instantly in my good books..

I suggested meeting in the Zoologischer Garten of Berlin, the oldest zoo of Germany, where I go regularly and try to bond with the animals living there to make them feel seen and valued.

When Chris and I met at the entry, he wanted to invite me as he was aware I live on government‘s support and did it in such a gentle way I didn‘t feel embarrassed at all. Lucky me, I treated myself to an annual ticket last year, so there was no need but the gesture alone has been so kind.

For the first part, we didn‘t mention the Sidephone at all. To meet Chris was different for me. I seldom meet new people, and normally, it doesn‘t take long for me to notice there‘s something off (read: they find me weird and complicated, an unnerving know-it-all). Not so with Chris. He‘s been the kindest accompaniment. He asked a lot of questions about the animals (some of them very endangered species in the wild) and didn‘t seem to mind me talking too much out of nervousness and because I felt all those animals deserved my help in getting another person interested in them.

I quickly lost the feeling of having met a stranger. If one cliché about Canadians is true, then that they‘re friendly. But the good and heartful friendly, not the superficial kind. He helped me to ease into our conversations, was a good listener, and asked questions that showed interest in my view of seeing things and life. He told me about the impressions he got from the famous IFA fair and appreciated my feedback about it.

When we had managed to get the last cup of coffee and piece of cake in the Zoo restaurant before closing, the dialog finally turned to Sidephone, and I have been beaming with joy. The first hour we experienced exactly what Sidephone wants to support us in: put our phones away and reconnect with the people around us, with our surroundings, and to immerse ourselves in life full of meaningful, joyful, creative activities and just value the very present moment. We would only take our phones out for a quick shot to remind us later, but else they were in our pockets and our minds free to savour the company, the conversation, and our surroundings.

It felt so good to disconnect from my smartphone and rather connect with Chris.

Then we sat down in this oasis, which makes the Zoo in Berlin special, a very calm place despite being in the middle of the city. I finally could take the Sidephone into my own hands, and my inner Gen X teenager got instantly excited. The candy bar form factor felt so familiar as did the keypad. It lay in my hand so easily and lightweight, yet well balanced, and I could really see myself falling in love with it. I can assure you this is a beauty that‘ll crush the glass slab biests.

Chris then offered me a sneak peek, like with the now already published cases as well as the upcoming qwerty tile. He didn‘t have to, and I found that trust in me assuring.

I admit I had feared a bit of a qwerty (or qwertz in my case) tile that would be crammed up with very tiny buttons like with some old Nokia, where typing had been a pain even with me having very small fingers for a guy. But again, Sidephone proved they think outside the tile, errr, box, and they came up with a very elegant and, I suppose, easy-to-use practical interpretation of a qwerty keyboard. I could imagine you guys will be as excited about it as I am and only can say: stay tuned, it‘s going to be worth it.

I had the chance to ask Chris a bit more about the philosophy behind Sidephone, and I could really see it working for many people around the world. We just have to acknowledge that without our determination and discipline to change our lives for the better and healthier, for deeper and more meaningful community and connection, even a Sidephone could do nothing for us. But if we‘re committed to reclaiming our minds and mental and physical health back, Sidephone holds up to be what it claims: a device to support us in pursuing what matters to us while minimizing the fear of being severed from the useful aspects of modern technology.

At the end of our timeframe, Chris and I visited the sloths and there‘s, where the circle went round: The sloth was hanging from a tree and veeeeery slowly dipping his forehead into the box with fruits and vegetables, turning its head and taking veeeeery slowly and absolutely focused on its task a piece of fruit with its mouth and chewing it reverently while resting its head on the rest of its meal.

Yes, we shortly took out our phones to capture a memory of this cute and lovely animal being deeply immersed in the present and apparently only the present. But most of the time, we had our phones shoved down into our pockets and simply followed what this one sloth taught us: that being fully immersed in the present moment and your experience of it gives you a sense of being alive no constantly looking and scrolling on a smartphone could ever gift us. Sharing the deep concentration of this sloth filled us both with deep satisfaction and a profound happiness.

I got the impression this would have been even easier for me if I had had the Sidephone in my pocket instead of the huge glass slab I still use. But even having Chris around with his Sidephone and the calm he radiated out supported me to not take my phone out when not needed.

What I take away from this 1:1 meeting with Chris:

* The Sidephone is very real, functional, and will very soon find its way to the first thousand people who hopefully feel and experience what I could today. I can‘t wait for Europe and the rest of the world to follow soon.
* Chris himself is a very real person, this is not a scam, and this is also not one of these well-meant but badly executed devices currently around but a truly well-thought-through product.
* I feel honoured to have met such a special young man (I‘m old enough to be his - very young, but still - father). It‘s been an inspiration that a person from Gen Z is already so settled and centered, almost wise in their level of self-reflection and how they see razor-sharp the dangers of today‘s technology to what makes us human and connected beings but without condemning technology at all. I think it takes a lot of bravery to put your own hard-earned money into something you deeply believe in in today‘s world and I bow to that commitment.
* Since I had the Sidephone in my hands, I for the first time felt confident that with its help I can finally overcome what sneakily over the last couple of years had developed into a full-blown smartphone and internet addiction. Something I always have been very wary of and couldn‘t believe that I had fallen into this trap despite having always been cautious.
* Did I mention already that the Sidephone is an absolute beauty? I‘m an old-school „form follows function“ guy and the Sidephone scratches all the itches for me.

I hope my impressions might be of help for others interested in the Sidephone and would want to encourage you to give it a chance. If you‘re a bit like me, I‘d invite you to dream with me and imagine a world where Sidephone is only the first of its kind and that more and more people around the planet take their destiny into their own hands again.

Imagine a world where more and more people start to reclaim their time for what truly matters in life (how different that may look to each of us), their creativity, their clarity of mind, and critical thinking. Imagine how people start to actually talk to each other again when waiting for the bus, looking for a direction, watching some squirrels chase each other. Imagine a world where people relearn to connect in person, relearn to accept their different views on topics, relearn to accept that humans are full of contradictions but in their deep are very sociable people hard-wired to help each other and live in friendly communities. Imagine we relearn to actively and patiently listen to each other to let our own views be inspired and enriched by those of others.

This is my personal Utopia and I just know it‘s still possible. I wish for Sidephone to be a worldwide success story and one of many tools to help to make this Utopia come to life. We can do better as the global human society and I‘m determined to keep faith in that we finally will.

I already even saw her make a Tinder account RIGHT AFTER the conversation happened. I just did some work in our office and a few hours later, I already heard her giggling with some skinny,red haired model that looks like one of those small alternative brand photoshoots. And then,I heard them banging. I ate my dinner in silence as I listened them giggle and talk shit about me- just confirming she wants me gone, at 2 am. When they finished,she came downstairs as I was half-asleep on my office chair and just handed me a blanket with a simple ""sorry"" then walked out. I woke up today for work and I got ready,didn't even answer when she asked ""You're going to work already?"" and just left.

I get paid minimum wage in Texas which is already pretty bad considering the amount of companies willing to pay more for someone who’s barley just getting their first job but it just feels like it’s not worth my time as I also got to balance education.

My mind is telling me I shouldn’t say anything until later because I’m still new and have to start somewhere but other side is telling me that I should because it feels wrong for me to put 9 hours into this job on the weekends just for minimum wage and unpaid overtime.

1ntziru,https://www.reddit.com/r/pl3nish/comments/1ntziru/starting_a_clean_fast_for_autophagy_longevity/,Starting a “Clean” Fast for Autophagy & Longevity — What I’m Doing (and Why),"Hey everyone — Casey here from Pl3nish.

I’ve been reading the research on fasting, autophagy, and lifespan, and I’ve decided to start a structured clean fast for a couple of days after listening to an episode of Diary of a CEO featuring Dr Alan Goldhaber. My main goal: give my cells a chance to repair, recycle, and reset — not to lose weight.

Here’s how I’m approaching it:
	•	What I’ll consume: only water, black coffee, unsweetened tea (decaffeinated or herbal), and zero-calorie electrolytes. Has anyone tried manna before? No broth, no fiber capsules, no oils.
	•	Why: Autophagy doesn’t really ramp up until ~18–24 hours, so I want to get past that point. I’m aiming for a 36–48 hr window to hit the deeper repair pathways.
	•	What I won’t do: add “gray zone” items (cream, collagen, psyllium, vegetable broth). They’re fine for weight-loss fasting, but I’m focusing on longevity.
	•	Protocol: I have done 14–16 hr daily time-restricted eating. I did a couple of 24 hour fasts before too. This will be my first 36–48 hr stretch.
	•	Break plan: ease back in with something light (steamed veggies, miso broth, and a vegan protein shake) before a normal meal the following morning.

I’d love to hear from those of you who’ve done longer clean fasts:
	•	What benefits did you notice?
	•	Any best practices for electrolytes and sleep during the 36–48 hr window?
	•	How often do you personally go beyond the daily TRE (time-restricted eating) for autophagy?

I’ll share my results here afterward — both how it felt and what I learned.

Stay strong, fast clean,

I studied out on the East Coast in New Brunswick, and now that I’m settled near 17th Ave I figured it’d be nice to meet some new people and make friends here.

I really like the vibe of 17th Avenue, but I figure it’d be much nicer to experience it with more people than just myself. So I’m hoping to connect with others around Calgary. Whether it’s hanging out, grabbing a drink, checking out a new spot, or just chatting about life, I’m always down.

A little something about me:
- I’m a big Formula 1 fan (Forza Ferrari even though they’ve been testing my patience lol)
- I love music, especially from the 80s, and I’m really into concerts. I’ve seen everyone from The Eagles and Queen to Jacob Collier!
- I play the acoustic guitar and sometimes play for worship at church
- I’m trying to get into the habit of going to the gym and playing badminton more regularly (been eyeing MNP)
- I occasionally play Valorant, never really played ranked though
- I’m always down for chill hangouts like grabbing coffee, befriending all the dogs that walk on 17th Ave, or catching a live show (Calgary Phil ftw 🙌🏼)

Anyway if you’re also looking to meet new people or just hang out, lmk! Would love to connect 😊",4,1759193906.0,CalgarySocialClub,2,0.84,False

Any recommendations as far as cleaning or anything? These home machines are sometimes still a mystery to me even though I work with espresso machines daily!

1ntzgyf,https://i.redd.it/snh0w6zda7sf1.jpeg,An Indian Option Similar to the Ninja Luxe Cafe?,"I'm really enamored by something like the Ninja Luxe Cafe that's an all in one coffee machine aimed towards beginners (or moderately lazy enthusiasts whichever way you see it). The price point also seems great at the equivalent of about 45k inr in the US. Even though it's probably not the best coffee machine out there per the reviews it's a really attractive proposition for me since I've never owned a coffee machine (currently using a Moka Pot) and I'm okay not getting an absolutely insane cup, it'll still be a step up while having the machine's intelligence with all the grinding of the beans, extraction etc.

Ninja of course doesn't sell it's products here but is there an alternative to this equipment in the Indian market at the same or lower price point? Conversely if anyone has actually used this machine or similar ones, I'd love to know your experience.",1,1759193809.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
