The goal is to drop .torrent files in a watch folder and have them auto-download and move to Plex.

We created this structure in /storage/:

* /torrents/watch/movies and /torrents/watch/tv
* /torrents/incomplete and /completed

Set up auto-add in qBittorrent:

* Watch /torrents/watch/movies ‚Üí save to /Plex Media/movies
* Same for TV

Set 777 permissions on all folders (recursive).

But **nothing works**. qBittorrent always says **""Cannot make save path""** when trying to save anywhere under /storage/, even with full permissions.

Manual ""Add Torrent File"" only lets me upload from my PC, not from the server.

Tried direct to Plex folder, middle folders, everything. Same error.

Seems like **AppBox/Docker blocks qBittorrent from creating any subfolders under /storage/**, no matter what.

Is there a fix?

My discord is Dabanju

I'll gladly give a cup of coffee as appreciation of the help.

Okay so she's older than me by 4 years but again somethings happening and I don't know what. 

So I recently shared her a reel where it was like a older girl scolding her younger boyfriend and then after sending that reel she just hugged me and leaned her head towards me. 

I was just wondering what happened, and what's up with this sudden hug. 

Then we called in the evening and there she broke down and crying about her mental health and all. 
It was my WFH but I came to office just for her because she was not doing good mentally. 

So the next day when I actually arrived, she just hugged me tightly for good 4 seconds or something and then she proceeds to asks me if she can keep legs on my legs and when I was about to answer she said no. 

Then we made coffee together as well, and the thing is, she's the one who always makes coffee for us. But today she asked that from me and when we were making the coffee our physical distance was very close. 

But now the thing is, while being away we don't call, or text. Also, she has a boyfriend and she was doing all of these with me. 

I was just left feeling that I am being used, so that she can fulfill her emotional needs. 

Ik I am not wrong in that, but what about those moments we shared ? What do they mean in this context ?
I am really confused, please help me. ",1,1761731651.0,AskIndianWomen,3,1.0,False

The entire thing was written during 5am sessions before the house and the dogs woke up. Balancing a full time job, family life, and daily training sessions meant early mornings were the only way it was going to happen.



Some things that worked: keeping a consistent wake up time even on weekends, writing before checking email or news, setting a realistic daily word count, mine was 300 words and even something as small as prepping the coffee maker the night before so I didn‚Äôt waste willpower first thing in the morning.



What didn‚Äôt work: trying to write after long, exhausting days, setting unrealistic daily goals that only led to guilt, juggling multiple projects at once, and waiting for the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù writing conditions.



I worked with palmetto publishing for editing and printing since time management was already hard enough. Having everything in one place was worth it because it let me focus on actually writing.



The biggest surprise wasn‚Äôt just finishing the book, but how much better I felt having a creative outlet outside of work and training sessions. Writing turned into a kind of meditation practice that bled into other areas of life in a good way.",1,1761731507.0,PartneredYoutube,0,0.67,False

It doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. It builds up slowly, until one day you realise you‚Äôve been running on empty for months, maybe even years.

At first, you keep pushing through. You still do the things you need to do. You show up for work, for your family, for your commitments. But as time goes on, you start to adjust around the tiredness. You start saying no to things you used to enjoy. You cancel plans because you don‚Äôt have the energy. Your world begins to shrink a little, not dramatically, just enough that life starts feeling smaller.

And while that‚Äôs happening on the outside, something else is happening inside too. Physical tension starts to build because your body never gets the deep rest it needs. Emotionally, your baseline becomes lower. You feel more irritable, more withdrawn, or just flat. And your mind, which stays active and alert through the day, uses the quiet of the night to start overthinking. It‚Äôs eplaying moments, worrying about what‚Äôs next, or trying to solve problems that don‚Äôt need to be solved at 3am.

It‚Äôs not about pushing harder to fight it. In fact, that‚Äôs often what keeps the cycle going. The more stagnant we become ‚Äî physically, emotionally, and mentally ‚Äî the more these patterns pile up. It‚Äôs about first recognising what‚Äôs really happening and then gently creating small openings for change.

Living with insomnia doesn‚Äôt have to mean stopping everything or waiting for the perfect night of sleep before life can feel better. It‚Äôs about finding smaller, realistic ways to support your energy.¬†

Think about how you can use your five senses to do that: sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. The five senses are a great way to bring positive stimulation into your day in a gentle way that feels good to you. Whether it‚Äôs listening to music you enjoy, noticing something beautiful outside, taking in the scent of your morning coffee, or feeling warmth on your skin from a shower or sunlight, these moments can lift your energy bit by bit. Over time, they start to build a sense of positive connection in your day, which becomes a quiet support system for both body and mind.

Change doesn‚Äôt always start with sleep itself. Sometimes it begins with reconnecting to the parts of your day that give you a sense of energy and possibility again.

üí¨ I‚Äôd love to hear from you.  
If you‚Äôve been living with long-term insomnia or sleep problems, what‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôve noticed that helps you feel a little more alive during the day? Even when nights aren‚Äôt yet resolved.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I‚Äôm not going to lie I am more attracted to someone older than me than someone my age right now everyone at uni just look like little boys to me ü§£ü§£ and not a well established and mature guy.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caff√® Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don‚Äôt like coffee and ¬£2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Steps:

* Download the Caff√® Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caff√® Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the ‚Äúwallet‚Äù section then ‚Äúvouchers‚Äù. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1oizypd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortervilleFraud/comments/1oizypd/autumn_oaks_assisted_living_hazmat_issue/,Autumn Oaks Assisted Living Hazmat Issue,"Here is a comprehensive analysis of the Facebook post and its comments regarding the incident at Autumn Oaks assisted living, dated October 28, 2025, around 6 PM.

# Executive Summary

The post describes a significant emergency response, including a Hazmat team, at the Autumn Oaks assisted living facility. The comments that follow paint a picture of a facility with a long and severe history of neglect, health code violations, and potential regulatory failure. While the exact cause of the Hazmat incident is unconfirmed in the thread, comments suggest a severe infestation problem (bedbugs/roaches) leading to a full-scale evacuation and decontamination of residents. The discussion raises serious concerns about illegal conditions, unethical treatment of vulnerable adults, and strange or inconsistent details about the facility's operational status.

# Analysis of Key Themes and Allegations

# 1. The Immediate Incident: Hazmat Response and Evacuation

* **What is Known:**¬†A Hazmat (Hazardous Materials) team was present, indicating a potential biological, chemical, or environmental hazard. An evacuation of all residents was confirmed by a commenter.
* **Commenter Claims:**
   * **Rosella Edwards**¬†provides the most detailed account, stating the cause was ""Bedbugs and coach \[sic\] roaches,"" requiring residents to leave without personal belongings, wear yellow biohazard suits, and undergo ""sterile showers"" at new facilities.
   * **Carrie Chapa**¬†speculates about a deceased individual or a suicide, which is a common but unsubstantiated rumor in such situations.
* **Analysis:**¬†A Hazmat response to an infestation is extreme but not unheard of in cases of severe, widespread pest contamination that poses a public health risk. The described procedures (biohazard suits, sterile showers, confiscation of belongings) align with protocols for containing a pervasive environmental health hazard like scabies or a massive, resistant insect infestation.

# 2. Potentially Illegal and Unethical Conditions

The comments allege numerous conditions that likely violate state and federal laws governing assisted living facilities.

* **Gross Negligence and Public Health Violations:**
   * **Anonymous participant 729**¬†and¬†**Vicki Bodley**¬†describe the facility as ""100% disgusting,"" with ""poor cleanliness,"" and a ""Fire Hazard."" These are direct violations of health, safety, and fire codes.
   * **Rosella Edwards'**¬†description of an infestation so severe it requires a Hazmat team points to a catastrophic failure in basic facility maintenance and sanitation, which is a violation of licensing requirements.
* **Inadequate Staffing:**
   * **Anonymous participant 729**¬†explicitly states the facility doesn't ""have the right amount of workers."" Understaffing is a critical ethical and legal failure in care facilities, leading to neglect of residents' medical, hygienic, and emotional needs.
* **Neglect of Vulnerable Adults:**
   * **Lorri Rogers**¬†hints at the residents' plight, noting they ""likely had no place else to go."" The core ethical violation here is the exploitation and neglect of a vulnerable population who have limited options.
   * **Rosella Edwards**¬†mentions that ""most of the men were scared and didn't want to leave,"" indicating poor communication and a traumatic evacuation process, which is an ethical failure in patient care.
   * **Anonymous participant 413**¬†claims residents were ""free to walk around,"" ""very confused,"" and had ""stolen our mail."" This suggests a lack of proper supervision for residents with cognitive issues like dementia, which is a serious licensing and safety issue.
* **Misrepresentation:**
   * **Anonymous participant 729**¬†alleges the facility's online promotion is ""100% NOT what it‚Äôs promoting and offering."" This could constitute fraud and false advertising.

# 3. Strange and Concerning Details

* **The ""Zombie"" Facility:**¬†Multiple commenters (**Melissa Clifton**,¬†**Maricela Kindle**,¬†**Jiggs Boyd**) express surprise that the facility was even operational, describing it as ""ran down,"" with a ""burnt building in front."" This creates a strange dissonance‚Äîhow could a facility that looks condemned to the public still be licensed and housing vulnerable residents?
* **Perceived Regulatory Failure:**¬†A strong theme in the comments is frustration with the state and county.¬†**Anonymous participant 729**¬†claims the ""State keeps it funded to keep it open,"" while¬†**Vicki Bodley**¬†states she reported them ""9 years ago."" This points to a profound lack of faith in the oversight systems meant to protect residents. The comment from¬†**Porterville FYI**¬†about the county investigation is the only official-sounding action mentioned.
* **Vague and Alarming Location Descriptions:**¬†Directions like ""north Jaye st ,just nothing of the Human Bean"" and ""off of Henderson by the Human Bean"" are informal, but the reference to a nearby coffee shop as a landmark for a decrepit care facility is ironically jarring.

# Conclusion and Recommendations

This social media thread serves as a chaotic but deeply concerning public record of a crisis at Autumn Oaks. While it is essential to treat online comments with caution, the consistency across multiple independent accounts, spanning years, strongly suggests a pattern of severe and illegal neglect.

**Summary of Identified Issues:**

* **Illegal:**¬†Probable violations of health, safety, and fire codes; potential Medicaid/Medicare fraud if conditions don't meet standards for funding; possible violations of state licensing requirements for staffing and resident supervision.
* **Unethical:**¬†Gross neglect of vulnerable adults, traumatic evacuation handling, misrepresentation of services, and a systemic failure to protect a dependent population.
* **Strange:**¬†The widespread public perception that the facility was already closed or condemned, juxtaposed with it apparently operating with state funding.

The most credible course of action suggested in the thread comes from¬†**Sharon DeMasters**, who recommends contacting the¬†**Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program**. This is the correct and official channel for reporting abuse and neglect in care facilities. The situation described warrants an immediate and transparent investigation by Tulare County Health and Human Services, as well as state licensing authorities.",1,1761730346.0,PortervilleFraud,0,1.0,False

1oizxps,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicWalther/comments/1oizxps/want_to_know_final_purpose_of_human_life/,want to know final purpose of human life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1761730239.0,ClassicWalther,2,1.0,False

1oizx3e,https://fbhvc.co.uk/news/article/britains-love-of-historic-vehicles-powers-73-billion-boost-to-the-uk-economy,The Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs has today released its 2025 National Historic Vehicle Survey...,"This is a good coffee break read on classic cars and their contribution to the UK.

We'll follow up with a proper blog on this later in the week, but for now here are some key and interesting takeaways:

*""historic vehicles account for only 0.2% of all miles driven in the UK"".* 

Conclusion: it's a bit pointless and senseless to tax old cars environmentally. It's even worse to destroy an old car by stripping out its engine and replacing it with an electric motor. Their impact is tiny.



*""The historic vehicle sector now contributes ¬£7.3 billion annually to the UK economy"".*

Conclusion: we'll probably get taxed horribly at some point anyway.



*""more than 22.7 million adults regard historic vehicles as a vital part of Britain‚Äôs heritage"".*

Conclusion: A surprising number of people love classic cars. Is it time for a ""listing"" registry (like buildings enjoy) to protect this heritage?



*""Encouragingly, the under-35s now show the most significant interest in historic vehicles"".*

Conclusion: Classic cars have a strong future ahead, although the definition of a classic is constantly changing. We see this in auction values: it's much harder to sell pre-war cars now, as most collectors don't have an emotional attachment to them. Conversely, 80s cars fly off the books!

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I‚Äôm a 23-year-old guy based in London, looking to build real friendships that go beyond small talk, ideally ones where we can actually hang out, whether that‚Äôs grabbing coffee, going to gigs, or gaming together.

Who I‚Äôm Hoping to Meet:

Aged 18‚Äì26 (a bit older is fine if you‚Äôre genuinely looking for friendship)

Based in the UK - ideally London or nearby

Actually open to meeting in person at some point

A Bit About Me:

‚öΩ Play football weekly

üèéÔ∏è Into F1

ü§º WWE fan

ü§ò Rock & metal enthusiast - always down for gigs

üéÆ Big on story-driven single-player games

üé¢ Love theme parks, go-karting, and days out

üé¨ Into Marvel and all things nerdy

üß† Neurodivergent - It‚Äôs a big part of who I am and how I connect

What I‚Äôm Looking For:

Someone who values effort, consistency, and genuine conversation rather than quick DMs that fade after a day.

If we share some interests and actually click, I‚Äôm always up for meeting when it feels right.

If that sounds like what you‚Äôre looking for too, message me  and please say more than just ‚Äúhey‚Äù üôÇ Tell me your age, gender, location, and a bit about what you‚Äôre into.",1,1761729973.0,UkFriends,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Needed some affordable counter stools for my 36"" kitchen counter and ended up trying the HOOBRO 23.6"" rustic brown bar stools (set of 2). Sharing quick impressions in case you‚Äôre shopping for Bar Furniture With Stools and don‚Äôt want to overspend.

https://preview.redd.it/ei8y3ghuq0yf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3a75fe0106e4a225eafb8caa8f7ece0bcf2e7db

Why I picked these

* Space-saving: They tuck fully under the counter‚Äîperfect for small kitchens/apartments.
* Mixed decor friendly: Rustic brown + black frame works with modern, farmhouse, or industrial setups.
* Budget under control: Look pricier than they are, but still easy on the wallet.

What I liked after 2 weeks

* Comfort: The saddle seat is gently curved, so it doesn‚Äôt dig into your thighs. Surprisingly comfy for 30‚Äì45 min meals or laptop time.
* Footrests at two heights: Sounds small, but it matters. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6"" and use the lower bar; taller friends use the higher one.
* Stable build: Metal frame feels solid; no wobble once you tighten everything properly. Adjustable feet help on slightly uneven floors.
* Easy assembly: Clear labeling and simple steps‚Äîboth stools took \~25 minutes total.
* Compact size: Narrow seat saves floor space and doesn‚Äôt clutter the walkway.

Things to know (not deal-breakers, but good to be aware)

* No backrest: Great for casual seating, but not for hours of sitting.
* Narrow saddle: If you prefer wider, cushioned seats, measure first.
* Retighten once: I re-tightened 2 bolts after a week‚Äînormal for flat-pack furniture.
* Finish: Seat isn‚Äôt solid wood; it‚Äôs engineered wood with a rustic finish (still looks nice and wipes clean easily).

Fit & sizing tips

* Best for 36"" counter height (standard kitchen counters).
* You‚Äôll get \~12"" clearance between seat and counter‚Äîideal for comfortable sitting.
* They‚Äôre light enough to move, but feel sturdy when seated.

Who these are great for

* Small kitchens or breakfast nooks where stools need to disappear under the counter.
* People who like industrial/rustic style without going full farmhouse.
* Mixed-height households (dual footrests help a lot).
* Renters/first setups where you want decent quality without paying a premium.

Who might skip

* If you want plush, upholstered seating for hours of work.
* If you need a wider or deeper seat with a back.

Pros

* Comfortable saddle seat for short-to-medium sits
* Dual footrest heights = better leg comfort
* Stylish look that matches most kitchens
* Stable frame + adjustable feet
* Quick assembly; clear instructions
* Good value for a 2-pack

Cons

* No backrest
* Narrower than padded stools
* Needs a light re-tighten after initial use
* Engineered wood seat (not solid wood)

My setup

* White quartz counter, matte black pulls, stainless appliances‚Äîthese stools tie it all together without looking heavy.
* They slide fully under the overhang, so traffic flow stays clear.

FAQs I got from friends

* Will it work for a 36"" counter? Yes‚Äî23.6"" seat height is right in the sweet spot.
* Do they scratch floors? There are adjustable pads; I also added felt pads for extra caution.
* How long is assembly? Roughly 10‚Äì15 minutes per stool if you‚Äôre not rushing.

Final take  
If you‚Äôre upgrading a small kitchen or want stylish Bar Furniture With Stools that won‚Äôt eat your budget, these HOOBRO stools hit a nice balance of comfort, looks, and practicality. Not a lounge chair experience, but for daily meals, coffee, or quick laptop time‚Äîthey‚Äôre solid.

What do you think?,"My partner and I have been together over 20 years and have two primary-aged kids. We are friends and spend a lot of time with another couple, ‚ÄúCatherine‚Äù and ‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù who also have kids our children‚Äôs ages.¬†¬†The children attend school together.¬†¬†My partner and John are gym buddies and do a lot together with the kids.¬†¬†I have never socialised with Catherine unless my partner or the children are with me.¬†

Over the past three years, I have been unwell and not as social. I tire easily, have serious health issues due to previous septic shock, including cardiac and increased liver damage and have decided to stop drinking (my one drink every few months) entirely.

**Background**

**One week earlier:**¬†I told Catherine about my health and my decision to quit alcohol because of my recent liver results.

**Day 1:**¬†At a party soon after, I overheard Catherine joking,¬†*‚Äúlife‚Äôs too short not to drink,‚Äù*¬†*‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need people that don‚Äôt drink in your life,‚Äù*¬†and laughing at comments like¬†*‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want ‚ÄòI drove‚Äô on your headstone.‚Äù*¬†I was in tears. Upon leaving we got into an argument about why I didn't want to go to dinner with them and I told my partner I didn't want to be around someone who clearly stated that she doesn't want non-drinkers in her life, even if it was a joke because all jokes have an element of truth behind them. My partner defended her, saying¬†*‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt say that‚Äù*¬†and¬†*‚Äúshe was drunk, she was just joking.‚Äù*¬†He and our children went out to dinner with Catherine and others while I stayed home.

**Day 4:**¬†At our son‚Äôs soccer game, my partner spent the entire time talking with Catherine while I sat apart. That night he, Catherine, John and others went to a concert. I was invited last, after everyone else and declined.¬†¬†I had previously communicated to my partner that I was trying to buy tickets for the concert as a present from the kids and would probably go with him.¬†

**Day 5:**¬†I again told my partner how hurt I was and said it felt like he was having a one-sided emotional affair with Catherine because he had spent the past few days defending her and prioritised her feelings. I told him it was really painful to see him so concerned with Catherine's feelings at a time when I was dealing with medical issues and my feelings being hurt.  He swore that he would not put her feelings ahead of mine.

**Day 6:**¬†He finally raised my concerns with Catherine, and she texted:¬†*‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry that came across as insensitive and I honestly didn‚Äôt mean to hurt you.‚Äù*¬†I told him it was a weak apology and it sounded like she was sorry I overheard, not for saying it.

**Day 7:**¬†Catherine messaged him,¬†*‚Äúas you suggested I sent a message last night apologising and never even got a response,‚Äù*¬†and added she¬†*‚Äúdidn‚Äôt even know I was listening‚Äù*¬†and that¬†*‚Äúit was just a joke.‚Äù*¬†My partner urged me to reply and told her¬†*‚Äúit was not her intention to make you feel crappy.‚Äù*

I replied that¬†*‚ÄúI understood she did not set out to intentionally upset me‚Äù*¬†but explained how upsetting it was to hear those jokes made due to my medical issues.

**Day 8:**¬†Catherine replied,¬†*‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I had no idea around the extent of the health issues you are having... I can understand how those jokes wouldn‚Äôt have landed well.‚Äù*

Later that day, I saw on Find My iPhone that my partner went to Catherine‚Äôs house after the gym but didn‚Äôt tell me. When I asked, he first denied it, then changed his story multiple times before saying he went to ‚Äúcheck on the friendship.‚Äù

**Day 10:**  At our son's soccer game Catherine attended and stood within 1-2 metres of me the whole time.  We did not speak to each other.  I was expecting her to say sorry or at least say hello.  

My issues are:

* He lied about going to her house and changed his story numerous times about how/his reasons for doing so;
* I feel like Catherine has made herself the victim in this and is gaslighting me due to her messages to my partner that the comments were a joke, she didn‚Äôt know I overheard and I should have made it clearer [to her] how distressed I was about my medical issues;
* He defends and prioritises Catherine‚Äôs feelings over mine, despite me having to deal with medical issues;
* He rushes to make her feel better but dismisses or minimises my hurt;
* He has previously shared more information with her than with me.¬†¬†Their messages are more ‚Äòchatty‚Äô whereas ours are more ‚Äòprocedural‚Äô;
* They would meet for coffee, while he won‚Äôt make time for lunch with me despite my office being a lot closer;
* Even small things like him making drinks for her when he never did that for me and I probably won‚Äôt get the opportunity for that to happen now really hurt.¬†¬†

It feels like I‚Äôve been replaced emotionally. He does have other female friends but he is different with them. He insists it‚Äôs innocent friendship and I believe that he does not have any romantic feelings, but his defensiveness, secrecy and the way he comforts her before me make me wonder if I‚Äôm being paranoid or if this is really an emotional affair.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

About me, I have a fairly interesting nerdy job. I am interested in languages, spirituality, dancing, and I like to cook. I like to keep in shape and be healthy as well so it would be nice to meet someone similar. I am 6ft/182cm.

For me a nice date would be to go raiding charity shops, check out galleries, gigs or just a coffee or a nice walk. I am fairly introverted but I have managed to pick up some social skills over my 39 years. I like to have deep conversations with the right person.

I have a pic below, I'm afraid to share my face here but willing to share face and other PG pics if we get chatting.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KHL Showdown: Spartak vs. CSKA ‚Äì A Tale of Two Teams (and a Few Too Many Goals)**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a KHL clash that‚Äôs as chaotic as a toddler‚Äôs birthday party with a Zamboni. On October 28, 2025, **Spartak** and **CSKA** collide at Megasport Arena, and if the odds and recent form are any indication, this game will either be a masterclass in hockey or a fireworks show of contradictions. Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a linesman and the humor of a Zamboni operator on a coffee high.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Statistician‚Äôs Nightmare

The bookmakers have priced this as a near-tossup. **Spartak** to win in regulation sits at **2.65** (implied probability: \~37.7%), while **CSKA** is slightly shorter at **2.50** (\~40%). The ‚ÄúUnder 5.5 goals‚Äù line is a tight 1.90, and the ‚ÄúOver‚Äù is 1.94‚Äîmeaning bookies expect a goal-fest but can‚Äôt decide if it‚Äôs a *good* goal-fest or a ‚Äúwhy are these players just chucking pucks at each other?‚Äù goal-fest.

For context: Spartak‚Äôs goal differential (61-63) is like a leaky faucet in a dam‚Äîit looks okay until you realize it‚Äôs slowly flooding the basement. CSKA, meanwhile, has won four straight but did so against teams that collectively resemble a hockey version of the Harlem Globetrotters. Their last game against Kharkiv? A defensive masterclass in ‚Äúhow to win while looking like you‚Äôre sleepwalking.‚Äù

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Inconsistencies, and a Lack of Leadership

**Spartak** is the hockey equivalent of a reality TV star: all drama, no direction. They‚Äôve never won three games in a row this season, and their coach, Zharnov, is throwing his hands up like a fan at a tennis match. ‚ÄúWe lack a leader,‚Äù he groaned‚Äîa statement as shocking as finding out your neighbor‚Äôs a spy. Their defense? A sieve that would make a Swiss cheese wheel weep. After a 5-3 win over Sochi (where a defender racked up four assists, because apparently, defensemen no

I‚Äôve been using my **DeLonghi Eletta Explore** for about two months now, and lately I‚Äôve noticed a small delay between the ‚Äúcoffee brewing‚Äù stage and when the espresso actually starts pouring into the cup.

When I first bought the machine, the coffee started pouring almost instantly after grinding. Now there‚Äôs usually about a **5‚Äì8 second delay** before the first drops appear. After that, the flow and taste are completely normal.

Here‚Äôs some context:

* I always use **100% filtered water**, so limescale should be minimal.
* The grinder is set to **level 4**.
* I clean the brew unit regularly.
* The descaling indicator is still green and hasn‚Äôt reached halfway yet.
* The ambient temperature and water are both cooler now (it‚Äôs autumn), so I wondered if that could slightly affect pressure or heating time.

Is this short delay (under 8 seconds) normal as the machine ‚Äúbreaks in,‚Äù or should I consider running a descale or deeper cleaning anyway?

1oizgoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LiveMates-AE/comments/1oizgoy/how_to_find_a_reliable_roommate_in_dubai/,How to Find a Reliable Roommate in Dubai?,"Finding a good roommate in Dubai can be surprisingly challenging ‚Äî not just because of high rent prices, but because the city attracts people from all over the world, each bringing their own lifestyle, habits, and expectations. At LiveMates, we‚Äôve spent years observing how expats, students, and professionals navigate the shared housing scene here. Based on what we‚Äôve seen, there are a few key things that can make the difference between a comfortable home and a stressful living situation.

# 1. Understand What You‚Äôre Looking For

Before you even start searching, it‚Äôs worth taking a step back and asking yourself what ‚Äúreliable‚Äù really means to you. For some, it‚Äôs about paying rent on time. For others, it‚Äôs about shared values ‚Äî cleanliness, quiet hours, or a similar work schedule. Dubai‚Äôs housing market is diverse: you‚Äôll find shared flats in Marina and Business Bay, family villas in Mirdif, and cozy apartments in Al Barsha. Knowing your own priorities helps filter out mismatches early.

Many expats we‚Äôve spoken to shared that being too flexible at the beginning often leads to regret later. If you know you value privacy, don‚Äôt compromise on it just to save on rent. Being clear about your deal-breakers ‚Äî smoking indoors, overnight guests, or loud parties ‚Äî saves everyone time and tension down the line.

# 2. Use Reliable Platforms and Networks

Dubai has countless Facebook groups, WhatsApp chats, and housing portals, but not all of them are equally safe or transparent. The city‚Äôs fast-moving rental scene sometimes makes it easy for scammers to take advantage of newcomers. We‚Äôve seen cases where listings looked great online but turned out to be misleading ‚Äî either fake or already taken when someone arrived for a viewing.

One useful approach is to stick to verified platforms or community-based tools where users can be reviewed or reported. That‚Äôs one reason LiveMates exists ‚Äî to help people connect through verified profiles and shared interests, reducing the guesswork that comes with random social media posts. It doesn‚Äôt guarantee perfection, but it adds a layer of accountability that‚Äôs often missing in open online groups.

If you prefer a more personal route, ask around your workplace or university network. Dubai‚Äôs expat community is surprisingly well-connected, and many people find roommates through word-of-mouth rather than public listings.

# 3. Meet in Person (or Over a Video Call)

It might sound obvious, but many people skip this step ‚Äî especially if they‚Äôre moving from abroad and want to secure housing quickly. We‚Äôve heard multiple stories from LiveMates users who signed contracts before meeting their roommate and later realized they weren‚Äôt compatible. Even a short video call can reveal a lot: how communicative the person is, their general attitude, and whether you feel comfortable with them.

When possible, arrange a casual chat over coffee or a walk around the neighborhood. Discuss practical details like work hours, guest policies, and how bills are divided. You‚Äôll quickly sense whether your lifestyles align or not.

# 4. Learn About Rental Agreements and Etiquette

Many newcomers don‚Äôt realize that subletting rules in Dubai can vary depending on the landlord or the building. In some cases, sharing a flat without permission can lead to fines or even eviction. Before you agree to move in, make sure your arrangement is legitimate. Ask for the tenancy contract (Ejari) and confirm that your name can be added if needed.

Another small but important detail is cultural awareness. Dubai is home to over 200 nationalities, and what feels ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in one culture might be unusual in another. Simple gestures like respecting prayer times, keeping common spaces tidy, or not cooking late at night can go a long way toward building trust and harmony at home.

# 5. Red Flags to Watch Out For

Through our community, we‚Äôve seen a few recurring warning signs that often predict roommate issues:

* They avoid discussing rent or deposits clearly.
* They refuse to show official documents like Ejari or ID.
* They want to move in or take payment urgently ‚Äútoday.‚Äù
* They have a history of switching places frequently.

While not every case like this means trouble, it‚Äôs always better to pause and verify. A quick check can save weeks of stress later.

# 6. Communication Is Everything

The best roommate relationships in Dubai ‚Äî and anywhere else ‚Äî are built on respect and open communication. One insight we‚Äôve noticed from LiveMates users is that regular check-ins help prevent misunderstandings. Something as simple as agreeing to a monthly ‚Äúapartment meeting‚Äù can keep everyone aligned about cleaning schedules, expenses, or household issues.

Another helpful idea is to set shared digital notes or a small chat group for bills and chores. It might sound overly structured, but it keeps things transparent ‚Äî especially in busy households where people have different work hours.

# Final Thoughts

Finding a reliable roommate in Dubai isn‚Äôt just about luck ‚Äî it‚Äôs about clarity, honesty, and a little bit of research. The city‚Äôs fast pace and cultural mix can make it tricky, but they also create opportunities to meet people you might never have encountered elsewhere.

At LiveMates, we‚Äôve seen hundreds of success stories where roommates became genuine friends or even business partners later on. The key is to approach the process thoughtfully rather than rushing into the first available room.

We‚Äôd love to hear your perspective: How did you find your roommate in Dubai? What worked ‚Äî and what didn‚Äôt? Share your experience below ‚Äî your advice might help someone new to the city make a smarter, safer choice.",1,1761728376.0,u_LiveMates-AE,0,1.0,False

I also have a fairly stagnant job so I don‚Äôt get much physical activity while I‚Äôm working.
I also have a couple of young kids and my family life is pretty hectic and busy, between work and my home life I don‚Äôt have time to go to a gym regularly. I do go on the occasional walk or bike ride and I‚Äôm fairly active outside of work but I don‚Äôt ever ‚Äúwork out‚Äù as such. 
I did some research and thought I‚Äôd give IF a go.
2 weeks in and I just feel flat. 
I ended up catching a cold a week in and haven‚Äôt been able to kick it so I‚Äôm unsure if this is causing me to feel this as well. 
I‚Äôm currently doing 16 hour fasts, I‚Äôm not feeling hungry or craving food surprisingly, I started to just drink black coffee but for the last week have switched to black tea. I just sip on it all day.

Am i dreaming in thinking that if I just fast for 16-18 hours a day I‚Äôll feel better while also losing a bit of weight? All while not getting what I‚Äôd call an intense workout in? 
If the only true way I‚Äôm going to feel and see results is by working out daily I suppose I‚Äôm going to have to try and juggle my life around.

We‚Äôve lived together for about a year and it was great at first ‚Äî we got along well, split chores, hung out sometimes but also respected space.
About six months ago, she started dating this guy ‚ÄúEvan.‚Äù At first, I didn‚Äôt mind him coming over. He seemed polite enough, and I figured it would just be a few nights a week. But now? He‚Äôs basically living here.
He‚Äôs here every single night. He showers here, eats our groceries, uses our Wi-Fi, and even does his laundry in our washer. He doesn‚Äôt contribute to rent or utilities, and when I brought it up once, Kayla brushed it off like, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs barely here, it‚Äôs not a big deal.‚Äù
It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in my own apartment. I come home from work and he‚Äôs sprawled out on the couch watching TV. Sometimes he‚Äôs there when Kayla‚Äôs not even home. I once walked in on him using my coffee maker and said something like, ‚ÄúHey, didn‚Äôt realize you‚Äôd be here,‚Äù and he just laughed and said, ‚ÄúKayla told me to make myself at home.‚Äù
Last week I finally snapped a little. I told Kayla we needed to talk and said I didn‚Äôt think it was fair that he‚Äôs staying over every night without helping with bills. I was calm, but firm. She got really defensive and said I was being ‚Äúterritorial‚Äù and ‚Äújealous‚Äù because I‚Äôm single. (???)
I told her it wasn‚Äôt about that ‚Äî I just don‚Äôt want to feel like I have an uninvited third roommate. She said I‚Äôm overreacting and that it‚Äôs ‚Äúher home too‚Äù so she can have whoever she wants over.
Since then, things have been awkward. She barely talks to me, but he‚Äôs still here constantly. I‚Äôm seriously considering moving out when the lease is up, but part of me wonders if I am being unreasonable. Maybe couples do spend that much time together and I‚Äôm just not used to it?

I've been using Dorico (among other tools) since Dorico 3 to edit large orchestral scores with a good amount of custom articulations to drive a rich set of VSTs (\~70 VSL or Spitfire instruments in Vienna Ensemble Pro).

In Dorico 4.5 everything went smoothly, especially copy-pasting and undo (Ctrl-Z). But with the exact same score in Dorico 5, these two specific actions became atrociously slow, e.g. 2-3 whole seconds each. When you need to undo 5 or 6 actions at a time (which is very common), it really kills the flow. Several people reported this issue but the answers were evasive or ""your score is big, that's why"" -- which is not acceptable since it's 2025, we have huge CPUs/RAM configurations and Dorico is supposed to be a professional tool. I can't go back to Dorico 4.5 either for reasons (this post is long enough already).

Apparently the problem was related to Dorico recalculating the entire playback after each edit üôÑ and this was partly solved in Dorico 6, if I'm reading the change log correctly (the recalculating stuff is delayed until Dorico is idle for some time, like when you take a sip from your coffee I guess).

It seems my trial license for Dorico 6 is expired so I can't test myself, so I was wondering if anyone in the Dorico community had experienced the same kind of issue with slow copy-pasting and undo in Dorico 5, and whether switching to Dorico 6 had improved it.

I started on my weight loss journey in September with light calorie restriction, a daily 90-minute walk outside, and a 1-hour youtube workout. After only losing 2 kgs after nearly 2 months, I looked into intermittent fasting and started a 16:8 schedule. But with social obligations, I was finding it difficult to stick to. I then had an opportunity to do a 36-hour fast, so I did it. I started on Monday evening and went through to Wednesday morning.

I found that it wasn't hard to do and I continued my physical activities without a problem. I drank a lot of water whenever I felt hungry, but honestly, I felt pretty full the entire time. The hard part was that I was home during the day, so I wanted to eat out of boredom, like I usually do. Once I got through Tuesday, I watched a tv series in the evening and had no thoughts of food. I went to bed late, but I couldn't sleep at all. I think I finally slept at 5am. 

I woke and found that I have lost 1.2 kgs from my fast. I had a breakfast of eggs and avocado toast with coffee. Now it's sitting in my stomach not digesting. I'm drinking lots of water to get things moving, so we'll see.

I thought it was better for me, but i can‚Äôt motivate myself.","So I was on Adderall IR 20mg 2x a day for a few years. I was feeling like it was maybe a bit hard on my body, and I wanted to try out vyvanse since allot of people say it‚Äôs smoother. 

I started on 40mg and idk why, but I slept SO much for about a week. Like pass out at 5pm, wake up for a few hours, pass out till morning type sleep. It was glorious honestly! Once things evened out I felt more calm and chill, but still got stuff done here and there! I definitely started spending more time watching tv and movies, which I also enjoyed at the time. 

I briefly went up to 50mg, but it was just too much for me, so I went back to 40mg. I realized now though that I always kinda supplemented with something on this dose to feel properly medicated, whether it was coffee or dark chocolate (which I don‚Äôt like to use either every day), and I eventually added an adderall IR 5mg booster. This helps a bit. 

So now, about 10 months later, I‚Äôve moved and am trying to unpack my stuff. I‚Äôm also trying to get back to work after a hiatus and need to get things set up at my shop. I just‚Ä¶ have been STRUGGLING! I feel an initial boost when I take vyvanse, but then I get like this weird tiredness. Not like I wanna sleep, but I just wanna lay down and be on my phone and watch tv‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt REALLY wanna do this cause I have all these things I need to be working on! 

I decided to take just the adderall one day. I took 20mg split into 2 doses and I FINALLY got some stuff done and unpacked with ease. No anxiety either, which I think the vyvanse gives me a bit of. I also finally called my friend who I had been meaning to, but just felt too blah. All the feelings of overwhelmed were turned way down and I felt hopeful again. 

What the heck?! I thought vyvanse was suppose to be amazing! I mean, I do like it but not if I‚Äôm actually having to do real life stuff like this, which is kinda the point with medication‚Ä¶ anyone else not do so well on vyvanse??

My buddy Dave told me this story from his first month of quitting. He was having a brutal day, stuck in his gray little cubicle, and a craving hit him like a physical blow. He was white-knuckling his desk, seconds away from caving.

On his lunch break, in a moment of sheer desperation, he did something weird.

He walked to a pet store and bought a goldfish.

The cheapest, most basic orange goldfish they had, in a little plastic bowl. He put it on the corner of his desk, right in his line of sight.

His coworker asked what its name was. Dave hadn't thought about it, but his brain did a funny thing. He didn't name it Bubbles or Goldie. In that moment of intense craving, he named it after the one thing he wanted more than anything else.

He named it **Steady**.

And a weird thing started to happen. Every time a craving would start to rise‚Äîthat frantic, jangly, panicked feeling‚Äîhe wouldn't fight it. He would just turn his head and look at this tiny, orange fish swimming in lazy, silent circles.

And he'd say, just under his breath, ""Hey, Steady.""

Sometimes he'd just watch it for ten seconds. Watch it just **be**. Unbothered. Calm. Steady.

The fish became his anchor. The craving wasn't a signal to smoke anymore; it was a signal to look at the fish and remember the goal: Stay steady. He told me he wasn't fighting an urge anymore; he was just checking in on his fish.

It's the silliest thing in the world, but he completely rewired the trigger. The alarm bell for panic became the dinner bell for calm.

So, here's the question. You don't need to buy a fish.

What's your goldfish?

What‚Äôs the one, simple, solid thing in the room you can look at right now‚Äîa coffee mug, a plant, a picture on the wall‚Äîand name **Calm**? Or **Forward**? Or **Free**?
