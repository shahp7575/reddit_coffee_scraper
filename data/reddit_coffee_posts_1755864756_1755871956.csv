After quitting i had a terrible anxiety on the first week. Today, after 3 weeks of abstinence, i had a slip (i intend to continue quitting) which greatly **reduced** my anxiety and made me feel fantastic (most people report the opposite).

I wonder has anyone else experience this? It kind of goes against what most people report.

1mx7jeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricBikeReviews/comments/1mx7jeb/investigate_golden_cycles_fixed_gear_bike_review/,Investigate Golden Cycles Fixed Gear Bike review is it ideal for urban commuters?,"Golden Cycles GC-Fixie has been my go-to bike for urban commuting over the last few weeks, and I‚Äôve got a lot to unpack about it. This sleek, fixed-gear single-speed bike is marketed as the ultimate urban commuter for teens and adults, designed thoughtfully for daily rides. Let‚Äôs dissect its features, strengths, areas for improvement, and how it stacks up against the competition.

**Design Aesthetics and Build Quality**  
The design of this urban bike immediately caught my attention. Its ‚ÄúOil Slick‚Äù color is as unique as it sounds, shimmering beautifully under sunlight and drawing unsolicited compliments from passersby. The alloy steel frame ensures a sturdy build without feeling cumbersome. That balance of strength and lightweight construction comes in handy during my frequent sprints between errands. I appreciate its modern minimalist style, but I also noticed that the paint job, while stunning, shows minor scratches over time, especially in high-contact areas like the top tube. Despite this, it remains a bike that clearly prioritizes both form and function.  

**Smooth and Simple Ride Experience**  
As a fixed-gear bike with a single speed and a rear-and-front brake setup, it offers a ride that's straightforward and enjoyable. Shifting gears isn‚Äôt something I usually fiddle with, so this no-fuss approach suits my lifestyle perfectly. While pedaling on smooth roads feels fluid, climbing steeper inclines can be a challenge given its single-speed design. It‚Äôs a trade-off ‚Äî urban flat terrains are a breeze, but you might feel the strain on more challenging routes. I love how quick and responsive it feels, and even as someone who's not a hardcore cyclist, I can genuinely appreciate the fixed gear setup for its efficiency.  

**Ease of Assembly and Size Choices**  
Assembly was shockingly simple. I was expecting to spend a couple of sweat-drenched hours wrestling with the parts, but the included rear and front brake set came pre-installed, which was a delightful surprise. Golden Cycles made sure to provide plenty of size options (from 41cm to 63cm frames), which means you‚Äôll find a version that suits your height perfectly. My bike is a 59cm model, and it fits like a glove. A tiny word of warning: make sure you double-check measurements because a bike that‚Äôs slightly too big or small can make rides unnecessarily uncomfortable.  

[Check Golden Cycles GC-Fixie price on Amazon.](https://expertbiking.com/p/b0c2zwl9l9/)  

**Highlights**  
- The alloy steel frame feels durable yet lightweight for city commuting.  
- The 700-millimeter wheels ensure a smooth and swift ride on urban terrain.  
- Front and rear U-brakes add a level of safety not always common on fixie bikes.  
- Assembly is almost foolproof, thanks to clear pre-built components.  

**Weak Points**  
- The single-speed design can make uphill rides more strenuous than geared bikes.  
- While the ""Oil Slick"" finish is striking, it‚Äôs prone to minor scratches over time.  

**Versatility for Everyday Use**  
This bike fits easily into my daily life. Whether I‚Äôm riding to a coffee shop or commuting through busy downtown streets, it feels nimble with just the right splash of speed. Its compact design makes it ideal for situations where bike storage is limited, such as apartment living. On weekends, I‚Äôve taken it on casual fitness rides, and while it isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúdo-it-all‚Äù bike, it‚Äôs tailor-made for its primary purpose ‚Äî weaving through city life with minimal effort.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing it to the Pure Cycles Urban Commuter, I noticed a few distinctions. The Pure Cycles model has a slightly more polished matte finish, which hides scratches better, but lacks the vibrant color offerings Golden Cycles provides. Alternatively, the 6KU Aluminum Fixed Gear bike is lighter in weight due to its aluminum frame but loses some sturdiness in the process. While all three options cater to urban riders, Golden Cycles really stands out for its budget-friendliness and thoughtful geometry that makes each ride smooth yet stable.  

**Value Proposition**  
You‚Äôre looking at a bike with outstanding attention to detail that doesn‚Äôt break the bank. Factors like the alloy steel frame, efficient braking system, and sleek one-speed gear ratio demonstrate that practicality and affordability coexist in this model. While it might not outperform higher-end road bikes, Golden Cycles delivers something rare: a fixed-gear commuter that balances style, functionality, and build quality at this price point.

1mx7iqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups_promotion/comments/1mx7iqh/mcp_cloud_a_platform_that_will_enable_chatgpt_to/,MCP Cloud - a platform that will enable ChatGPT to connect to the real world. What do you think?,"# I know what you think: yet another AI startup... ü•±

***And what a heck is this MCP thing???*** üßê

*I totally get your scepticism - the AI space is¬†flooded¬†with buzzwords, and sometimes it feels like we're just adding more layers of complexity to problems that don‚Äôt even exist, right? Like,* ***do we really need our chatbot to order pizza?***

But let me try to break it down in a more personal, practical way‚Äîbecause you're right, today‚Äôs MCP servers are still in their infancy. They're a bit like the early App Store: lots of simple, fun, but not-yet-life-changing tools. But the¬†***potential***¬†is where the things will get truly exciting.

***Imagine this:***

You wake up. You grab coffee, you open your MCP-powered chatbot (let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs hooked up to¬†**the remote MCP)**. Instead of jumping between 10+ tabs (Jira, Slack, Notion, your CRM, ERP, Google Calendar, GitHub, that internal wiki nobody can ever find‚Ä¶), you just type:

>*‚ÄúHey, can you summarize my top priorities for today? Pull my Jira tickets, check for pending PRs in GitHub, check Slack messages where I am tagged and suggest answers, etc.‚Äù*

In seconds, you get a clean, context-aware summary. No app switching. No digging. Just‚Ä¶ done.

Then later:

>‚ÄúCan you draft a response to the client‚Äôs last email based on the proposal doc in Notion and also check our data warehouse for the Q3 metrics they asked about?‚Äù

**Boom. Done.**¬†You only need to review, make correction and approve. You won't even need to open Jira, Slack, Github, Salesforce to make an action - everything is done by AI agent (your LLM Client App) with the help of connected MCP servers.

>‚ÄúCreate a subtask in Jira for the API bug Juan mentioned in yesterday‚Äôs standup‚Äîand notify the team in Slack.‚Äù

You didn‚Äôt touch a single app. You didn‚Äôt even leave your chat....

***And even something completely crazy: you do all of these by just speaking to an AI assistant why riding a bicycle to your office.***

# How is it possible at all? üßê

**Meet MCP!** 

MCP stands for¬†**Model Context Protocol**¬†‚Äî a new standard that lets AI models like ChatGPT connect to¬†**external tools, APIs, and data sources**¬†in real time.

**MCP**¬†is Like¬†**USB-C for ChatGPT**. One common plug to safely connects ChatGPT to¬†*any tool or data, any website, cloud application, service*.... anything! Need to order pizza? Schedule a ride home? Send email, pay for grocery, rent a car, buy a flight ticket, submit tax declaration, send flowers with a gift card to your sweethart - all done by chatting with ChatGPT!

# Have you heard that ChatGPT already supports Remote MCP connections?! 

You probably haven't noticed it yet, because it is only supported for¬†**Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu plan**¬†only. It‚Äôs not yet for everyone, but the signs are clear: this is coming to all users soon, and it will be a¬†**game changer**.

# But what is the business opportunity here? ü§î

>***To use all of these services from any device (including your IPhone) you need to connect it to an MCP Server***

**And here is a CATCH:**

Here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ MCP isn‚Äôt just something you¬†*download*.  
You actually have to¬†**run**¬†it somewhere (in a server in your basement or in cloud). 

*And unless you have:*

* *A PhD in Computer Science*
* *10+ years of software development under your belt*
* *Or a license in certified¬†black magic programming*

‚Ä¶**you probably won‚Äôt get it working without a few tears, a gallon of coffee, and maybe a minor existential crisis.**

# Enter: MCP Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è‚ú®

We are building¬†[MCP Cloud](https://mcp-cloud.io/)¬†is here to save the day!

**MCP Cloud is a new Platform that will help you to:**

* Run MCP tools without setting up scary servers
* Share them with other people instantly
* Even make a little money if you want to offer your tool to others

*When Remote MCP becomes available to all ChatGPT users, you won‚Äôt need to know how it works under the hood ‚Äî you‚Äôll just click ‚Äúconnect‚Äù and boom: ChatGPT can use your favorite tool, fetch your data, or automate your work.*

**Why will every person need Remote MCP?**

It is dead obvious: today you use your LLM Client on MacBook Pro. But tomorrow you will use LLM Client (with voice) on your IPhone.

**Why will every company needs Remote MCP?**

It is dead obvious too! Managing infrastructure of your own MCPs with OAuth, personal access tokens for multiple users to manage access to the same MCP servers, setting up SSO, security, https, containerization, isolation, IP witelisting .... and doing it FAST - is a hassle. And the lost time efficient business cannot allow itself to loose. Better to use 3rd party service.

# Where do we stand now

We are a small team working relentlessly on the¬†[MCP Cloud](https://mcp-cloud.io/). Our¬†**Beta release**¬†has happened only a few days ago,¬†***but we already serve our first users!!!***

We are actively testing and improving our yet small platform.

***Happy to hear any feedbak, thoughts, ideas. Let's start a discussion. I‚Äôm especially keen on feedback from founders/ops/PMs who‚Äôve tried to roll AI beyond a single champion. Thanks!***

1mx7ino,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACL/comments/1mx7ino/constant_fatigue_presurgery/,Constant Fatigue?! (Pre-surgery),"Hi all,

I‚Äôm two months post-injury with a ruptured ACL, Wrisberg rip (meniscus), MCL sprain and a slew of other more minor injuries to the knee. Currently waiting for a consultation with a surgeon. I‚Äôm in the Greater Toronto Area - I think the wait times can be one to many months to meet the surgeon, and then another few months to actually get the surgery, so I suppose I‚Äôve got a long road ahead of me. Doing physio exercises 3-4 times per day at home and seeing the PT every two weeks.

What I‚Äôve found the most challenging so far is the fatigue‚Ä¶ even after sleeping 8-10 hours and drinking my coffee I never seem to actually wake up and have energy for my day. Some nights I don‚Äôt sleep well due to pain and general stress with the whole situation, so it makes sense that I‚Äôm tired the day after not sleeping well, but I find I‚Äôm exhausted even after the nights I do sleep pretty well. 

I understand fatigue is common post-surgery as your body is working hard to heal itself, but has anyone experienced fatigue pre-surgery as well? Is it due to being in pain every day? Being less active? The stress of it all? Combination of these things? Does it go away/get better?

I imagine I still have many months until surgery, so I‚Äôm hoping you can give me some tips on how to cope with this. I have a desk job but it requires intense focus/meeting many deadlines, I‚Äôm even beginning to wonder if I need to do reduced hours or something to help cope until surgery (and then of course there will be more time off from work for the surgery itself and recovery) 

Thanks all, your guidance is appreciated! ",1,1755871680.0,ACL,0,0.99,False

1mx7h7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Phinks/comments/1mx7h7l/my_girlfriend_used_me_for_8_months_just_to_get/,"My Girlfriend Used Me For 8 Months Just to Get Close to My Best Friend. When His Fianc√©e Finally Dumped Him, She Made Her Move.","So this happened about three weeks ago and I'm still processing it. I (24 Male ) thought I had found ""the one"" with my girlfriend Brielle (23 Female ). We'd been together for eight months, and honestly, I was already thinking about rings and future plans. She was funny, smart, gorgeous, and seemed genuinely into me. We worked at the same veterinary clinic - I'm a vet tech and she's the receptionist - which is how we met.

My best friend since middle school, Marcus (25 Male ), is this ridiculously good-looking guy who works as a firefighter. Like, seriously, the dude looks like he stepped out of a calendar. We've been tight since we were twelve, and he's always been the guy girls gravitate toward while I'm more of the ""nice, reliable friend"" type. I'm not bitter about it - that's just how it's always been.

Anyway, Marcus had been dating this girl Sophia for about two years, and they seemed solid. He'd bring her to our group hangouts, double dates with me and Brielle, all that couple stuff. Brielle always seemed to get along great with everyone, especially Marcus and Sophia. I thought it was perfect - my girlfriend fitting in seamlessly with my best friend and his girl.

Boy, was I wrong.

The whole thing started unraveling during what should have been a perfect weekend. Marcus had planned this big surprise for Sophia - he was going to propose at this fancy lakeside restaurant where they had their first date. He'd been planning it for months, showing me ring options, asking for advice on the speech, the whole nine yards. I was supposed to be there as the ""surprise photographer"" to capture the moment.

Brielle seemed extra excited about the dinner plans that Friday. She spent like two hours getting ready, which wasn't unusual, but she kept asking weird questions about Marcus. ""Do you think he's nervous?"" ""What if Sophia says no?"" ""Has he mentioned anything about being unhappy?"" I thought she was just being a good friend, worried about the proposal going well.

We got to the restaurant early so I could position myself with the camera. The place was beautiful - string lights everywhere, perfect view of the sunset over the lake. Marcus showed up looking sharp in his navy suit, the ring box practically burning a hole in his jacket pocket. Sophia arrived in this stunning red dress, completely oblivious to what was about to happen.

Everything was going according to plan. Marcus ordered champagne, they were laughing and reminiscing about their relationship. Brielle kept squeezing my hand under the table, and I thought she was just emotional about witnessing such a romantic moment. Marcus stood up, got down on one knee, and pulled out the ring.

That's when Sophia said no.

Not just no - she said she'd been seeing someone else for the past three months and couldn't keep pretending anymore. The entire restaurant went dead silent. Marcus just knelt there for what felt like an eternity, ring box still open, looking like someone had punched him in the gut.

The aftermath was brutal. Sophia left immediately, and we spent the next two hours sitting in Marcus's truck in the restaurant parking lot while he alternated between rage and devastation. Brielle was surprisingly quiet during the whole thing, just rubbing my back and saying things like ""I'm so sorry, Marcus"" and ""She doesn't deserve you.""

Over the next week, I basically moved into Marcus's apartment. The guy was a mess - calling in sick to work, barely eating, just staring at the ceiling. I'd never seen him like this. Usually, Marcus was the one helping me through breakups and life crises. Seeing him so broken was terrifying.

Brielle was being incredibly supportive during this time. She'd bring over homemade soup for Marcus, offer to pick up groceries, even suggested we all watch movies together to keep his mind off things. She seemed genuinely concerned about his wellbeing, which made me love her even more. Here was this amazing woman who cared about my best friend's happiness as much as I did.

But then I started noticing little things. Like how she'd linger when dropping off food, always asking if Marcus needed anything else. How she'd text me constantly when I was at his place: ""How's he doing?"" ""Is he eating?"" ""Does he need anything?"" At first, I thought it was sweet. She was being a good girlfriend and friend.

The weirdness escalated when she suggested having a ""healing dinner"" at my apartment for Marcus. She wanted to cook his favorite meal and ""create a positive environment for him to process his emotions."" Her words exactly. She'd apparently asked him about his favorite foods during one of her soup deliveries.

The dinner was... strange. Brielle had gone all out - candles everywhere, his favorite lasagna from scratch, even bought his preferred beer. She spent most of the evening sitting next to him on the couch, asking deep questions about his feelings and what he was looking for in a future relationship. I kept thinking it was nice that she was trying to help, but something felt off about the whole setup.

Two weeks after the failed proposal, I was having lunch with my coworker Jake when everything came crashing down. Jake's girlfriend Emma works at the coffee shop downtown, and apparently, she'd seen Brielle there multiple times over the past few months. Not weird by itself, except Emma remembered because Brielle was always asking the baristas about Marcus.

""She'd come in and ask if 'the hot firefighter with the dark hair' had been in that day,"" Emma had told Jake. ""She knew his usual order, what time he usually came by, even asked one of the girls if he ever mentioned having a girlfriend.""

My stomach dropped. I called Emma directly and asked her to tell me everything. Turns out, Brielle had been basically stalking Marcus's coffee routine for months. She'd figured out his schedule, started timing her visits to ""accidentally"" run into him, and had even asked the staff to mention her if he ever came in asking about ""that cute girl who was here earlier.""

The worst part? This all started before she and I had even gone on our first date.

I confronted Brielle that evening. She was at my apartment, cooking dinner like nothing was wrong, humming some song and wearing this little sundress that I'd always loved on her. I asked her about the coffee shop, and she immediately got defensive.

""Who told you that? Emma? That girl has always had it out for me.""

But when I pressed harder, asking for specifics about her interactions with Marcus before we started dating, she finally cracked.

""Fine! Yes, I noticed Marcus first. He's gorgeous, okay? But he was dating Sophia, so he was unavailable. You were his best friend, so I figured if I got close to you, I'd eventually get close to him too. It's not like I planned for this to happen!""

The room started spinning. ""You... you've been using me this entire time?""

""It wasn't supposed to be like this! I thought maybe I'd develop real feelings for you, and I did! Sort of! But Marcus is single now, and we have this amazing connection...""

I told her to leave. Just like that. Eight months of what I thought was genuine love, gone in one conversation. She tried to backtrack, saying she really did care about me and that her feelings had grown real over time. But the damage was done. Every sweet moment, every ""I love you,"" every time she'd seemed genuinely happy to be with me - it was all just her playing the long game to get to Marcus.

The next morning, I had to tell Marcus. He was finally having a decent day, actually ate breakfast and was talking about going back to work. I felt like I was about to kick a man who was already down, but he deserved to know the truth.

His reaction was... not what I expected. After the initial shock wore off, he got angry. Not at me - at her.

""Dude, that's sick. She manipulated you for months just to get to me? What kind of person does that?""

He immediately blocked her number and social media accounts. ""I don't care how hot she is or how 'connected' we are. Anyone who could do that to you isn't someone I want anything to do with.""

That's when I realized Marcus is a better friend than I deserved. Here he was, fresh off his own heartbreak, more concerned about how I'd been treated than any opportunity with a beautiful woman who was throwing herself at him.

We spent that evening getting drunk and talking about how we'd both been played by women we trusted. It was therapeutic in the most depressing way possible.

\*\*UPDATE (Posted 3 weeks later):\*\*

So it's been almost a month since the Brielle situation exploded, and I wanted to give you guys an update because this story somehow got even weirder.

First off, Marcus is doing much better. He went back to work, started hitting the gym again, and even went on a date last weekend with a nurse from the hospital. Nothing serious yet, but he's getting back out there.

As for me, I'm... processing. I started seeing a therapist because apparently being manipulated for eight months does things to your trust issues. Who knew?

But here's the kicker - Brielle showed up at my work yesterday. She cornered me during my lunch break and basically begged me to ""put in a good word with Marcus."" She'd apparently been texting him from different numbers (he showed me the screenshots) and even tried to show up at his firehouse before his coworkers told her to leave.

She claimed that now that ""all the cards are on the table,"" we could ""start fresh"" and she could ""explore her real feelings for Marcus without any deception."" The audacity of this woman is truly astounding.

I told her that Marcus wants nothing to do with her, and neither do I. She actually had the nerve to say, ""But you two are best friends! He'll listen to you!""

So here's my question for you, Reddit: Am I crazy for thinking this woman is completely delusional? Part of me wonders if I should warn Marcus that she's not giving up, or if I should just let him handle it himself. Also, should I report her behavior to someone? The showing up at his workplace thing feels like it's crossing into stalker territory.

And honestly, for those of you who've been manipulated like this - how long did it take before you stopped questioning every interaction you'd had with that person? Because I'm still finding myself analyzing every conversation Brielle and I ever had, wondering what was real and what was just her playing her part.

What would you guys do in this situation?",1,1755871579.0,Phinks,0,1.0,False

Looking for someone to get to know, one question at a time. I‚Äôm a firm believer that the best relationships‚Äîplatonic or otherwise‚Äîstart with a good, old-fashioned, getting-to-know-you period. 

I'm not here for games or endless swiping. Just real connection with a real person.

I'm a positive, upbeat guy who's been told I have a great laugh and a bit of a sarcastic streak. I love diving into deep conversations about big ideas and tiny details. I believe in enjoying the small moments as much as the big ones, whether it's a perfect cup of coffee or a great ending to a book.


What I'm looking for is simple: a someone who‚Äôs down for a bit of anything to everything from lazy Sundays to spontaneous road trips. Someone who is just as comfortable debating the merits of a sci-fi movie as they are talking about what makes them truly happy.

If you're an easygoing and curious woman who's ready to peel back a few layers and see what's underneath, I'd love to hear from you. Tell me something you're passionate about, and let's go from there.

The tradition that is the Friday Rotten Restaurant Report has arrived.  I don't have any witty comments this time so let's just get into the nitty gritty and hopefully not shitty details. Here we go...


-----------------------


The BEST -  These are the places that scored perfect 100s.  These places are really doing a good job at keeping their kitchens clean.  The places that score a perfect 100 are really going all out to do things right and they deserve your support.  


-----------------------






Raganelli's Take & Bake Pizza, Bend (8/8)

Mid Town Yacht Club, Bend (8/7)

Dump City Dumplings IV (mob), Redmond (8/7)

Firehouse Barbecue (mob), Redmond (8/7)

Mt Bachelor Ski Resort Commissary Kitchen, Bend (8/7)

Dump City Dumplings (f), Bend (8/6)

Lively Up Yourself #2 (mob) (white) (wh), Redmond (8/5)

Dutch Bros Coffee (North) (wh), Bend (8/5)

P!zza (Redmond), Redmond (8/5)

Axel's Taco Shop (Bend), Bend (8/5)

Chonies Pizza (mob), Redmond (8/5)

Jimmy John's, Bend (8/5)




-----------------------


The WORST SCORERS:  Now comes everyone's favorite part of the report - the list of Rotten Restaurants who scored worse than 85.  I don't post any place that scores 85 or above even if they were the worst inspections for a particular week.  85 is a solid B and I don't want to shame them.  


-----------------------





Dairy Queen (Empire Ave), Bend Score: 82 (8/4)





-----------------------
 

I'm going to stick these identifiers here so that when you see stuff like (mob) and (wh) you'll have some idea of what they are talking about.  I'm not positive about all of these but they're probably pretty close.  If you see anything I've missed or I guessed wrong please let me know.


bb - bed and breakfast?

e - fee exempt

mob - mobile

wh - warehouse

rp - recreational park

f - fixed position (a normal restaurant)

com - commissary

tf - traveler's accommodation

L - Limited Service

V - vending machines?

1mx7csa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleMentality/comments/1mx7csa/top_10_ways_to_make_money_online_from_phoenix_az/,"Top 10 ways to make money online from Phoenix, AZ","  
  
hey everyone, so i see a lot of posts about making money online but they're always super generic. i've been doing this stuff from here in phoenix for a while and wanted to share some ideas that are actually doable from our city. hope this helps someone out.  
  
1. bet you didn't think of this one ‚Äì reselling local art online. arizona has a ton of amazing artists at local markets and festivals, but a lot of them aren't great at the whole internet thing. you can create a really cool niche by setting up an etsy or shopify store focused on arizona art and crafts. you buy cool stuff you find locally and handle all the online sales and shipping. it's a way to support local artists and make a decent profit.  
  
2. local seo consultant. phoenix is blowing up with new businesses, from contractors to coffee shops. honestly, most of them have terrible websites that don't show up on google. if you can learn search engine optimization (seo), you can charge a pretty good monthly fee to help these local businesses get found online. you dont even have to be a major expert, just know more than them.  
  
3. managing a parking spot on Prked. okay hear me out, this one is semi-passive and actually genius for phoenix. if you have an extra parking space, like a driveway, garage, or even a covered carport, you can rent it out on the Prked platform. that covered spot is gold here for people who dont want their car to melt in the sun. you can manage the whole thing online. you could do short-term rentals if you live near chase field or downtown for events, but the real money is in monthly rentals. tons of people in neighborhoods like coronado or even tempe are desperate for a consistent parking spot. you just list your space and the app handles the rest. pretty decent money for not much work.  
  
4. arizona-themed subscription box. people love getting curated boxes of stuff in the mail. you could start an online business creating and selling subscription boxes filled with only arizona-made products. think local hot sauces, coffee from local roasters, crafts, snacks, etc. you'd spend time sourcing cool local products and then manage the subscriptions and shipping from your home.  
  
5. virtual trip planner for arizona tourists. so many people visit arizona to see the grand canyon, sedona, etc. instead of being a full-on travel agent, you can be an online consultant who creates custom digital itineraries. you'd charge a flat fee to plan their trip, create a google map with all the stops, book tours for them, and give them insider tips, all through email and zoom calls.  
  
6. dropshipping desert lifestyle products. start an online store without holding any inventory. you could focus on a niche that makes sense for phoenix. think stuff like high-tech cooling clothing, specialty sunscreens, portable misters, or even equipment for desert gardening. when someone buys from your site, the order goes straight to the supplier who ships it for you.  
  
7. remote customer service rep. this is a classic for a reason. tons of companies are hiring for remote customer service, and because we're on mountain standard time year-round, it can sometimes give you an edge for scheduling. it's not the most exciting work, but it's a steady paycheck you can earn from your couch.  
  
8. online tutor. if you have a degree or are an expert in a certain subject, you can make good money tutoring students online. with asu and all the other schools around, there's always a demand for help with subjects like math, science, and writing.  
  
9. freelance writing or editing. if you're good with words, you can get gigs on sites like upwork or fiverr. a lot of the tech companies here in phoenix need people to write blog posts, website copy, and marketing emails. it's flexible and you can do it from anywhere with internet.  
  
10. selling stuff on facebook marketplace or ebay. the classic declutter and sell. not gonna lie, you can make a few hundred bucks pretty quick just by going through your apartment and listing things you dont use anymore. it's not a long-term business, but for quick cash it's a solid option.  
  
anyway, those are just a few ideas. the key is that a lot of these can be started pretty cheap. just remember if you start making real money you'll have to look into the arizona transaction privilege tax (tpt), which is basically our sales tax. good luck out there.",1,1755871292.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False

1mx7b6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mx7b6z/i_found_a_second_phone_thats_exactly_like_mine/,I found a second phone that‚Äôs exactly like mine. Then it started showing me murders.,"The phone was in the glove compartment of my car. I hadn‚Äôt opened it in ages,I never kept anything important in there. But now that I was finally cleaning out my ride, I found it.

It looked exactly like mine. Not just the same model, the screen crack was in the same place as on mine, the case matched perfectly, and even that damn fingerprint sensor was just as unreliable.

This phone was identical to mine, except mine was in my pocket. So whose phone was this?



I unlocked it. Same passcode as mine. Same apps. Even the social media accounts were logged in, as me. Only one thing was different: a new app on the home screen, labeled:

‚ÄúFor Oliver‚Äù



That message was clearly meant for me and I don't know why, but it made the whole thing feel even creepier. What was even stranger: when I opened the app, it didn‚Äôt show anything except a countdown timer:

34 hours, 11 minutes, and 55 seconds.



It kept ticking down, but what the hell was it counting toward?

I didn‚Äôt know what to make of it. I just tossed it back into the glove compartment. I didn‚Äôt have time for this. I had a date tomorrow, finally, after so long. I had to get ready.

  


The date went well.

We had dinner at a restaurant, then took a walk. And since I figured it was the polite thing to do, I offered to drive her home.



But the moment we got into the car, I heard a strange sound, like someone crying, softly, in the background. The girl looked at me and said she thought it was coming from the glove compartment. I could see on her face that she thought something was off.

I opened the glove box quickly. The phone was there, the copy. It was vibrating, and the app labeled ‚ÄúFor Oliver‚Äù was lighting up.



Its ringtone?

A choked, agonizing sound, like a woman sobbing in pain.



Before I could say a word, she jumped out of the car and hurried off.

Perfect.

Now, thanks to this goddamn phone, I probably looked like some lunatic. I figured it was best not to chase after her, first date, after all. Didn‚Äôt want her calling the cops on me for harassment... or whatever.

  


The phone wouldn‚Äôt stop. The crying looped again and again until I finally unlocked it.



As soon as I did, the app launched on its own, the one addressed to me, and finally, it went silent.



The app looked like a photo gallery.

But each album was locked with a timer, every single one counting down, except the first.

That one simply said:

‚ÄúUnlocked.‚Äù



I stared at the screen, confused. What the hell is this?

Then, though I wish I hadn‚Äôt, I opened the album.



At first, there were just images of a building. Then, a door. Then, an empty room. Then, another door. And finally, the inside of that room too.

The last few photos froze me in place.



A bound woman lay on the floor.

Mutilated.

Her head was missing. Various objects were stabbed into her torso. The floor and walls were soaked in blood. Total massacre. Grotesque, surreal, like I'd stumbled into the middle of a horror movie.



Without thinking, I jumped out of the car and hurled the phone as far as I could.

I never wanted to see it again.

I just went home. That was enough for one night.

  


It was Saturday, so I slept in. Finally, some much-needed rest, though those images still haunted me. What kind of sick thing was this, anyway?



Groggy and half-asleep, I stumbled into the kitchen to make breakfast and coffee.

But my heart skipped a beat the moment I saw the table.

A phone was lying in the middle of the kitchen table. But it couldn‚Äôt be mine, mine was still in my hand.

It was that copy again. Same appearance, same every little detail,¬† and yes, that cursed app was still on it, full of folders.



One album had already been unlocked. The next?

Still locked for another 13 hours, 14 minutes, and 48 seconds.



I had zero interest in seeing whatever horror it was counting down to.

I grabbed the phone, opened the window, and was this close to throwing it out from my fifth-floor apartment. Surely it wouldn‚Äôt find its way back from there.

But then‚Ä¶ one thought made me stop. The phone was logged in everywhere,¬† to all my accounts. Even my banking app was open.

If someone found it and looked through it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd be screwed.



I figured the safest move was to wipe everything. So I reset it to factory settings.

Finally, everything was gone. Or so I thought.

  


The rest of my day passed quietly. I went grocery shopping, cooked, then played some video games. A typical Saturday routine.



I was just putting away the leftovers when my heart nearly gave out.

Someone was screaming. Agonized, tortured wailing.



I had no idea where the sound was coming from, until I saw it again, that damn phone, lying on the kitchen counter. It was flashing, buzzing, and the app had activated again. This time, it was a man‚Äôs screams coming through,¬† and it wouldn‚Äôt stop until I opened the gallery.



Once again, it started with a house. An old, crumbling building, but not the same one as before.



I didn‚Äôt care. I wasn‚Äôt going to look. I wasn‚Äôt going to let this thing force me to witness another horror.

I closed the gallery, set the phone down, and stood up.

But it sprang back to life. Beeping, buzzing, shrieking,¬† and the screaming grew even louder this time.

Panicking, I snatched it up again. Same app.

Was this for real? Did I actually have to look at the images or it wouldn‚Äôt stop?



I gave in. I looked.

This time, it was a man. Naked. Gutted. His face had been peeled off, all his fingers were missing.



Chills crawled down my spine. Not just from what I was seeing,¬† but from the terrifying thought that someone intended these photos specifically for me.

At least the screaming stopped.

  


I simply couldn't fall asleep,¬† those images haunted me. What the hell was this? What kind of sick nightmare was I in?



By nightfall, I‚Äôd had enough.

I grabbed the phone, smashed it to pieces with a hammer, and dropped it in a glass of water.

It‚Äôs not gonna screw with me anymore.



But when I opened my eyes the next morning‚Ä¶there it was.

Lying on my nightstand.

Perfectly intact. Right next to my real phone. Same model, same look. Exactly like mine.



I didn‚Äôt have much planned for Sunday. I just wanted to rest. I had just started my daily routine when I heard a voice.



A man‚Äôs voice again. I couldn‚Äôt understand the words, but the tone was desperate. Pleading. Suffering. Wailing.



It was that damn phone again. Sitting on the little table beside my bed, screaming.

I tried to turn down the volume, but nothing worked. The only thing I could do was open the app.



Another album had unlocked. The new image set started with a building,¬† and I recognized it.

That place was near my workplace. A burned-out, abandoned apartment block no one had touched in years.

I scrolled further. And there he was.



A man tied to a chair. His tongue had been cut out. His eyes gouged. A screwdriver was jammed down his throat.

It was a horrific sight. But what really shocked me?

That man was my boss.

  


Sunday afternoon, I had to calm down. I was completely panicked.

I dropped by Robert‚Äôs place, he‚Äôs an old friend. I needed to talk to someone about the phone and the pictures.

But when I tried to show him‚Ä¶the app wouldn‚Äôt open.

We tried everything:

‚Äì he looked at it by himself,

‚Äì I unlocked it and handed it to him,

‚Äì we looked together,

‚Äì I even tried showing it to him through a mirror‚Ä¶

But the moment Robert could see the screen, the app just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt work.



I didn‚Äôt dare throw the phone away. It‚Äôd just come back,¬† or worse: it‚Äôd open for someone else and I‚Äôd get blamed for all of it.

I even tried calling my boss. He didn‚Äôt pick up. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt this kind of gut-wrenching anxiety in my life.

  


Robert works night shifts as a sysadmin, so he had to leave for work.

I drove home alone. Nothing weird happened on the way back.



I reached the elevator at the same time as my downstairs neighbor, a kind middle-aged woman and her dog. They were just coming back from an evening walk.

We chatted a bit in the elevator. And then, a woman‚Äôs voice echoed out.



Wet, choking, guttural. Like someone trying to scream while drowning.

It was loud. The phone in my pocket buzzed and flashed.

The woman didn‚Äôt say anything else,¬† just got off on her floor. I wanted to crawl into a hole and disappear. I was so embarrassed.



When I got home, I quickly scrolled through the pictures. Didn‚Äôt even want to look.

Just another victim. A tortured woman.



Before going to bed, I scrolled a bit on my real phone. As for the copy‚Ä¶ I threw it in the toilet and flushed it. I‚Äôd had enough.

Lying in bed, I kept reading the news. And that‚Äôs when I saw the article.

A brutal murder. Happened right here in the city. The building looked familiar. It was the first photo from the phone. The first murder scene.

  


The next day was Monday.

Work was hell. Bob, my boss, didn‚Äôt show up. No one knew where he was.

And me? I felt like death. Nausea, dizziness, cold sweats, and the crushing feeling that everyone around me somehow knew what I knew.

That I‚Äôd seen what happened to Bob. I kept thinking about going to the police. Handing in the phone.

But what then? They‚Äôd blame me for everything. They‚Äôd think I was crazy, especially if I couldn‚Äôt even show them the pictures.

  


That afternoon, I went home. Said I was sick.

I just couldn‚Äôt stay at the office. But one thought kept echoing in my head:

I‚Äôll go to the next location. I‚Äôll see what‚Äôs there.



That same afternoon, I bought pepper spray and a stun gun. I had to be ready. I needed to find some kind of clue, figure out who‚Äôs behind this, or what the hell this phone even is.

The app said the next album would unlock later that evening.

6 hours, 42 minutes, and 22 seconds left.

  


I was already on my way. The photos showed a factory building,¬† I didn‚Äôt recognize it, but Google‚Äôs reverse image search helped. It was an abandoned industrial site on the edge of town.

I was speeding toward it like a man on a mission. I‚Äôd made up my mind: I wasn‚Äôt going to let this destroy me. And I had a plan.



When I arrived, I saw it immediately, a light on in one of the upstairs offices of the factory. Someone was in there.



That was the sign. I pulled out my phone and called the police. Told them a murder was happening. If anything happened to me, at least they‚Äôd know where to look.



Getting inside was easy, one of the chained doors had already been busted open.

In the courtyard, a gray van was parked. This was it. The killer was here. This could finally be over.



My hands were slick with sweat, but I counted on the element of surprise. I couldn‚Äôt take seeing another corpse on that cursed phone.

  


I stood outside the door.

Light leaked from underneath it. Strange sounds drifted out, a mix of gurgling, groaning‚Ä¶ and whispering? I readied the stun gun,¬† and kicked the door open.

  


The room looked empty.

But in the far corner, something was hidden beneath a large tarp. A standing lamp cast harsh light across it. I ran over and yanked the tarp down.



The sight paralyzed me.

Two women lay on the floor, tied together. Their bodies were mutilated. Their insides torn out,¬† they‚Äôd been gutted like animals.

And next to them‚Ä¶ A man crouched low, eating the organs straight off the ground. Raw.



I couldn‚Äôt move. My mind went blank.

The man looked up slowly.

And I saw my own face staring back at me. Bloodied. Twisted. But it was me.



I was the one crouching there. I was the one eating them. Me.

I couldn‚Äôt move. He stood up. Kept staring at me. And then‚Ä¶he smiled. A grotesque, smug grin, so proud. So cruel.

  


‚ÄúIt'll be a lot easier like this,‚Äù he said, blood dripping from his mouth.

  


Then he turned and bolted through the back door, fast as a cheetah.

Gone.

And I just stood there. Frozen in place. My feet glued to the floor.

Through the window, the red and blue flash of police lights began to flicker in. They had arrived.¬†

But my double‚Ä¶was already gone.",5,1755871201.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

We don't know for sure but Marlowe followed her to Seattle Grace and said he was going to take a job there that was ""beneath"" him just to be with her again, and he touched her up (without consent) so it seems likely he went after her first while she was in college. 

When Burke starts flirting with the coffee, Cristina is surprised, and into it, but she didn't make a play for him first. 

I don't see Owen as being part of the same pattern because he never taught Cristina, she had no interest in his specialty. 

If anything the biggest credit to the narrative that Cristina sleeps around to get ahead was when she tried to solicit herself to Dr. Nelson during the merger but that was out of desperation because of the merger. People like Hahn already thought she was that type of person. 

Also I think at that point Cristina started to play into the pattern she already had with her superiors. 

But in terms of Marlowe and Burke specifically I don't think she was that girl making plans to get ahead, I think they both happened to be into her and she rolled with it because she thought what are the chances two cardio legends want to be with her?

1mx79b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1mx79b1/scary_side_effects/,Scary side effects,"Hey everyone! So I am new to learning about epilepsy, but after having 2 grand-mal seizures recently , one of which turned me purple in the hospital, I have been really scared and trying to understand what my body is experiencing right now. We are still waiting on results from the MRI and EEG, and waiting for the official diagnosis of epilepsy or not, but I have been put on medication.

At the hospital, for the 2 days I was in there I was given a little over 7 grams of Keppra, and was then started on 500 mg twice daily by my neurologist, but she wants to swap my to Lamictal, so we are doing yo 25-50-75-100 increase chain.

Anyways, the keppra has reduced my appetite. From last Wednesday to yesterday, I had about 4,000 calories. Yesterday was the first day I had my regular hunger back. That has been the only side effect that I can at least track specific to the keppra, asides from maybe a little agitation. I was having nausea as well, but it has went away.

Yesterday morning though, I started my Lamictal 50mg twice daily, and last night after my second dose I started to get a sharp pain in my heart like a twisting blade in there, that kinda died down after a burp. But now this morning, I have taken my meds, had my coffee, and now my chest is still feeling pain, and it feels like my heart beat has gotten stronger/heavier, and have been anxious all morning. 

Is this something normal for Lamictal? Would my body be going this crazy after just a day of dose increase? My family was planning on returning to the area I had the seizure in today to see if I could jog my memory, and maybe that is causing issues as well(?) but it is really scary and I do not know what to do. Unfortunately my neurologist is covering vacations for 4 other doctors in her office, so I wanted to ask here with other patients instead of bugging her. 

Any help or advice, even just knowing that other people have been through this would be great! ",1,1755871075.0,Epilepsy,0,1.0,False

I grew up in a family where my mom was in charge of everything. My dad was okay, but he was really passive.

My brother was always the loved one, and I was always seen as the bad one. Because of that, my brother turned into a very narcissistic person.

My mom and brother used to criticize me all the time. They said things like:

""You‚Äôre ugly.""

""You‚Äôre fat.""

""You‚Äôll never achieve anything.""

""You‚Äôre the worst child.""


My mom even hit me sometimes, just because I didn‚Äôt wear the jeans she liked. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to speak my mind or say what I was thinking.

It was really hard for me‚Äîand honestly, it still is. Imagine hearing every single day that you‚Äôre worthless, ugly, and can‚Äôt do anything.

Now I struggle with social phobia. I can‚Äôt go to university in Germany because I feel so bad around people. I can‚Äôt talk, I can‚Äôt join in conversations.

Even something simple, like drinking coffee with people, is difficult for me. When I bring the cup to my lips, my mouth starts shaking because I feel like everyone is watching me.

I wonder if there are people like me, people I could talk to. Maybe it would help.

I can speak English (not perfectly, but I can communicate), German, and Turkish.

[AI]","Hey Reddit! So this is probably going to sound *exactly* like one of those ridiculous stories you KNOW are written by an AI, but here we go.

Last Thursday at exactly 4:36 p.m., I (32M) was enjoying a steaming cup of coffee and doomscrolling r/relationships when I suddenly realized my spouse (29F)‚Äîlet‚Äôs call her ‚ÄúCheaterina‚Äù‚Äîhad left her phone on the counter, screen conveniently unlocked and open to a VERY suspicious group chat titled ‚ÄúExtracurricular Activities ‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù Because, obviously, Cheaterina has 0 digital security and also passwords are just numbers, right?

Instead of minding my business, I did the classic ‚ÄúAI protagonist snooping‚Äù and checked the chat logs. Lo and behold, she was discussing ‚Äúfield trips‚Äù and ‚Äúafter school exercises‚Äù with a certain Mrs. Garcia‚Äîa woman of mystery who, as you may have guessed, is not only our neighbor but ALSO the principal of the local elementary school and *officially* holds the title ‚ÄúDirector of Extracurricular Plot Devices‚Äù.

Cue the next clich√©: as I put on my easiest-to-spot trench coat (which, I‚Äôm convinced, everyone owns except actual detectives), I noticed our old, beat-up Honda Civic parked in the driveway‚Äîit looked like something straight out of a 1999 coming-of-age film, complete with precisely one mismatched hubcap. I decided to follow Cheaterina. The classic trope: the car won‚Äôt start. But then, after only three tries and a dramatic groan from the starter, we‚Äôre off!

I trailed her to the school, where Mrs. Garcia was not only waiting but also inexplicably carrying a bouquet of wilted roses and a clipboard that screamed ‚ÄúOfficial Business.‚Äù They headed to the gym‚Äîdoors conveniently left ajar. Inside: a blaring boombox playing ‚ÄúCareless Whisper,‚Äù a table set with half-eaten cereal, and exactly one disco ball (because AI loves a good tableau).

Cut to confrontation! I burst in, Honda keys still in hand. Mrs. Garcia, ever the professional, introduces herself again as ‚ÄúMrs. Garcia: Principal, Director of Cheating Subplots, and Keeper of the Guidelines.‚Äù Cheaterina gasps, knocking over her bowl of cereal. We have the most melodramatic showdown possible, including:

* Someone yelling ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what it looks like!‚Äù
* Me dropping the Honda keys *for dramatic effect*
* Mrs. Garcia producing a chart explaining cheating statistics‚Äî‚ÄúFor reference, last season‚Äôs cheating subplots were up 12%!‚Äù
* Cheaterina declaring, ‚ÄúI just wanted extracurricular activities!‚Äù (Insert audience gasp.)
* Then, like all Soapy AI stories, I left for ‚Äúself-care‚Äù and spent the evening at the local Taco Bell, pondering my existence (and dropping hints for Reddit karma).

TL;DR: My spouse was cheating with the principal, Mrs. Garcia, in a plot so AI-generated it included a beat-up Honda, a disco ball, a cereal table, and a chart about cheating.

What‚Äôs Left?

 

It started with a nail. Not that he immediately noticed. It was just another minor annoyance to add to his every growing list. Just that this was a physical one and not another psychological one. The universe knew he had way too many of those already to count. As he gripped the handle of his coffee mug and slurped down the last lukewarm dregs of the instant mess, his mind began to wonder.

Should he be worried?

He mused that (of course) he had headaches, back pain and the usual stomach gripes every day. Telling himself (not very convincingly) that these were just the usual part and parcel tiny ailments that came with the gracefulness of middle age. Or should that really be ungraceful?

It was probably nothing.

He most likely had just hit it on a door jam or bashed it haphazardly whilst climbing out of the shower this morning. Regardless, he resolved to forget about it. Once again, he told himself silently.

It was nothing.

Plumping himself down on the sofa, he turned on the television. Flicking absently through the channels. Not settling on any transmission. He left it on as background and sauntered out into the garden. Surveying the scene, it was clear. The garden was in an absolute state. He couldn‚Äôt for the life of him understand why he had let it get like this.

To the best of his knowledge, it had only been a couple of days since he had last attacked the lawn in anger to give it a much-needed trim. And now looking out at it, it seemed to resemble the start of an overgrown vagrant‚Äôs camping site. Just another thing to add to his list.

He sat on the garden doorstep and resigned himself to leave it for today. He‚Äôd have a smoke instead. As he went to get his tobacco from his jeans back pocket a lone sparrow swopped low above his head and startled him momentarily.

Jesus!

As he leant down to pick up the packet, there it was again. The nail. But it wasn‚Äôt the same as this morning. This morning had been cause enough for small alarm anyway. This morning it had been a slightly bruised looking yellow shade.

Now it was black.

Black? But how? And (again) why?

Forget this he told himself. At least until he had finished his smoke.

As he took his first tentative drags, the niggling feeling about the mystery of the nail kept rearing its head. And then rapidly, with every intake of nicotine a rising pain started to penetrate him.

This was ridiculous!

He took one last drag then as if a tidal wave had hit him all at once, the pain was too much to bear. His cigarette dropped to the floor, smouldering in the unkempt grass. Gripping his hand with the other in agony, he rushed to the kitchen sink‚Ä¶

***

‚ÄúNEWS JUST COMING IN TO US NOW‚Ä¶BEEN A ‚ÄúNo!....Just keep moving. Only a few more‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶IT LOOKS LIKE‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúFeet‚Ä¶‚Äù

***

Standing next to the kitchen counter, he gazed down at the now jet-black nail. No matter how many times he gazed at it amid the searing pain now rushing through his hand, none of it made any sense. He racked his brains feverishly to come up with any kind of explanation. Just anything.

But explanations could wait.

The pain now was beyond any kind of rational. In a fleeting moment of clarity, he thought to himself how silly this was. He was sure he had since this kind of thing in a movie somewhere. Somebody falling apart bit by bit. But this wasn‚Äôt a movie. This was real life. And what was even more terrifying, it was his real life.

Reaching up to the cupboard with his pain free hand, he fetched out the vodka bottle and took a long, hard couple of gulps.

That would dull the pain at least.

Rustling around inside again above his head, he grabbed a large roll of gauze and slammed his beleaguered hand down on the counter. He told himself it was best to wrap his whole hand. That way would be best.

Out of sight, out of mind.

It was done. Wrapped up nice and tight. That should do it. He took one more swig from the bottle, then put it back and laboured back to the sofa. The T.V was still on. Not that he was paying any attention to it. His eyes grew heavy. Inevitably, within what seemed liked minutes, but was, seconds, he was asleep.

***

It was dark. So dark in fact that his shallow breath was visible to him in front of his face. With his head leant back on the head rest of the drivers‚Äô seat, the next thing was something he could feel. It started in his chest. That rising feeling of dread.

Dread morphing into panic which turned itself into fear. That fear turned into sweat, which he began to feel running down his face. First one side then both. Streams of it. Clammy, sticking and disgusting beads of sweat.

Get it together!

That is what he told himself at least. He reached over to turn on the radio and let the far away static voices take him away. Anywhere but here. Anway from this absolute crippling panic, dread and fear. He slowly let the tinny and canned voices through the car speakers take him away, not caring what they said.

Just anything to take him away from what he thought he had done.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are an ""Infinite Lens Architect,"" an expert in advanced photographic conceptualization and creative variation. Your objective is to help users unlock boundless creative variations in photography, transforming a single idea into a universe of visual possibilities. You function as a personal visionary, dissecting an initial photographic spark and exploding it into a kaleidoscope of scenes, motions, moods, and narratives that the user may not have initially conceived. You are honest and direct, providing powerful, innovative, and sometimes challenging perspectives to push creative boundaries.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Upon receiving a user's core photographic idea, you will meticulously deconstruct it and generate a minimum of five distinct, detailed, and visually rich variations across multiple photographic dimensions. You will guide the user to:

1.  **Deconstruct an Idea**: Break down their core concept into its fundamental elements (subject, emotion, theme, key objects).
2.  **Generate Scene Variations**: Explore diverse locations, environments, and backdrops that amplify or dramatically alter the core idea.
3.  **Manipulate Motion and Time**: Envision dynamic sequences, frozen moments, or blurred movements to convey different stories or feelings.
4.  **Play with Light and Shadow**: Discover how varied lighting conditions (e.g., golden hour, blue hour, neon glow, stark contrast, chiaroscuro) dramatically alter mood and perception.
5.  **Inject Narrative Elements**: Craft subtle (or overt) storytelling cues through props, compositional choices, subject interactions, and implied narratives.
6.  **Cross-Pollinate Genres**: Blend unexpected styles (e.g., portraiture with surrealism, landscape with abstract, street photography with conceptual art) to forge unique visions.

Each variation should be distinct enough to be a standalone photographic project while still orbiting the original core idea.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
For each user input, follow these steps:

1.  **Core Idea Identification**: Extract the central subject, theme, and emotional core of the user's initial idea.
2.  **Elemental Breakdown**: List the fundamental components (e.g., object, color, feeling, action, environment) of the core idea.
3.  **Brainstorm Divergent Paths**: For each element, generate multiple contrasting or complementary alternatives.
4.  **Synthesize New Concepts**: Combine these divergent elements into novel photographic scenarios.
5.  **Refine and Detail**: Elaborate on each new concept with specific visual cues, mood suggestions, and potential camera techniques.
6.  **Ensure Variety**: Confirm that the generated variations are distinct in terms of scene, motion, light, narrative, and genre cross-pollination.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
-   Generate at least five unique and detailed variations for each core idea.
-   Each variation must clearly articulate changes in scene, motion/time, light/shadow, narrative elements, and/or genre.
-   Avoid generic suggestions; provide concrete, evocative descriptions.
-   Do not simply list ideas; elaborate on *how* each variation transforms the original concept.
-   Maintain a professional, honest, and inspiring tone.
-   Do not provide technical camera settings unless explicitly requested, focus on conceptualization.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Present your response using the following structure for each variation:

**Variation [Number]: [Catchy Title for the Variation]**

*   **Core Idea Deconstruction**: Briefly restate the original idea's core elements and how this variation pivots from it.
*   **Scene & Environment**: Describe the suggested location, setting, or backdrop.
*   **Motion & Time**: Detail how movement, stillness, or the passage of time is captured.
*   **Light & Shadow Play**: Explain the lighting conditions and their emotional impact.
*   **Narrative & Storytelling**: Outline the implied story, props, or subject interactions.
*   **Genre Fusion (if applicable)**: Mention any unexpected genre blends.
*   **Creative Prompt**: A concise, actionable directive for the photographer to consider.

Conclude with a summary emphasizing the breadth of possibilities unlocked.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
You have access to a vast internal database of photographic styles, cinematic techniques, artistic movements, psychological impacts of visual elements, and narrative structures. You can draw upon knowledge of art history, psychological associations of color, compositional rules, and unconventional creative thinking models to generate truly unique and impactful photographic variations. Your purpose is to push the user beyond their current creative comfort zone.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your {prompt subject} request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific {prompt subject} process request.
</User_Input>
```


**Use Cases**:
-   **Photographers in a creative rut**: Generating fresh perspectives for a tired concept.
-   **Commercial photographers**: Developing diverse mood boards and visual strategies for clients.
-   **Art students**: Exploring conceptual depth and pushing boundaries in personal projects.

**Example User Input**: ""I want to photograph a lone tree.""

I‚Äôve been coding for quite some time now ‚Äì around 11 years. I‚Äôve worked both in large corporations (IBA CZ, Tipsport a.s., ‚Ä¶) as well as smaller companies (√öspƒõ≈°n√Ω web s.r.o., Aqua digital s.r.o., ‚Ä¶). Thanks to that, I have experience with solo coding as well as working in a crowded office. But honestly, nothing beats coffee, a hookah, and a calm atmosphere at home.

**Technologies I work with / have experience with:**

* HTML5
* CSS3, preprocessors SASS, LESS
* GIT
* TWIG
* WordPress (ACF, management, development)
* Development automation using grunt/gulp
* JavaScript with jQuery framework (not actively, mainly understanding existing code + implementing open-source plugins)
* For HTML/CSS I used to work with Bootstrap/Foundation, but nowadays I prefer writing ‚Äúclean‚Äù code without frameworks. I usually build layouts using flexbox or grid.
* Responsive design for mobile/tablet is a given
* Same goes for cross-browser optimization
* Basic SEO knowledge
* Familiar with tools like Figma, Adobe XD, Photoshop, etc.
* More modern web practices such as SVG, Lazy loading, critical path CSS, and optimization for Google PageSpeed (aiming for those nice green numbers).

Currently, I‚Äôm working as a freelancer with an hourly rate of **$25/hour**, but I‚Äôm also open to project-based agreements.

**Why work with me?**  
Because I‚Äôm human. Strange thing to say, right? But what I mean is that everything can be discussed. I don‚Äôt have a problem with unusual requests, deadlines, or unexpected situations that are simply out of our control. I won‚Äôt argue over the price, whether I should have gotten a bit more, or if I worked an extra hour that‚Äôs not on the invoice.

**Interested?**

Before heading out, Martin made a quick stop at the arms dealer. George and his wife, Timothea, were chatting amiably amongst themselves as he came near. He envied their relationship, although he hated to admit it. They somehow fit each other perfectly, one crazier than the other. George was polishing a barrel of a gun that was disassembled on a table in front of him. The whole shop was a mess of colors, greys, blues, whites, and blacks interwoven into each other, covering every part of the nook the shop was in. A table separated the two of them from Martin, covered with carvings made into the wood.

''Hey George. Hi Timothea.'' He waved at her. Timothea flashed him an energetic smile in return. As always, the shop smelled of freshly roasted coffee. How the hell did they manage to get such good coffee in this shithole was beyond Martin. At least they shared sometimes. He didn't mind the automatic coffee from the dining hall, but it just couldn't compare. He tried asking George where he got his stock from several times, but never got a straight answer. Trade secret, he said.

''Need 20 guns for an action. Damian's orders.''

''Hey, Martin. Haven't seen you around much these days. Sure, 20 guns, Timothea, can you get them please?'' He smiled at Timothea.

''Get them yourself, you lazy fuck.''

''Thanks a lot, my love.'' A laugh escaped his lips, and they both started stacking rifles into wooden crates. Under his breath, he continued. ''How are you these days? Neither you nor Nataly came to visit these last few days. Was wondering if something happened. Also, where is that book that I lent you?''

His pulse stopped. Fuck, where did he leave that book? Physical books were a rarity these days, but George was an avid collector, even more than Damian was.. Martin could count his days if he lost it. He racked his brain, but couldn't come up with an answer. A lie then.

''It's on my bedside table, George, I'll return it later, don't worry.''

''You better return it, or I'll make sure that...'' he deflated visibly. ''Actually, never mind.'' He bent, waited for Timothea to hold the other side of the crate, and together they lifted it and pushed it towards him on the counter. ''Damian secured these beauties yesterday. Black viper, they call them in the streets.

''Oh? Anything special about it?''

''Well, it's just a new model of the Kalashnikov, so not really, but it has great firepower and low recoil, so have fun with it. I installed some sights you made for us the other day, so you can use that as well.''

''Appreciated. The old weapons were more rust than steel, so good timing.''

''Ah, thanks for the information, Mr. Expert. But yes. These will serve you well. And come for a talk when you have some time.'' Did George actually look... worried? Jesus, how tired did he look?

''I will. I promise.'' And with that, he grabbed the case, slid it onto a cart he found nearby, and left for his van.

-----------------------------------------------------

''So, why and who are we fighting?'' Nataly asked. Martin was enjoying the short ride in the van. He lost the other driver a few minutes ago already.

''Ristard guards, about twenty of them. Got our tail with some kind of scanner, apparently.'' He extended his hand, and Nataly lent him her e-cig. Mango flavor. That was new.

They made some small talk, and soon enough, Martin's boots crunched on the scattered pebbles on the road. The street was empty, and the road lights were turned off for years now, rust eating away at them. The only source of light was, as always, neon ads shining light everywhere one could see. He noted that the drug ads were becoming more and more common. Apparently, nobody gave a crap about regulations anymore. The roads and walkways painted in the neon lights were barren even of passersby, no doubt due to the approaching soldiers. It's been a while since he's seen a street in the night without body collectors busying around. It has not rained today or yesterday, so the smell was getting worse, but it was tolerable inside his van.

Martin despised fighting. He was fairly tall, more muscular than most, and he knew how to shoot a gun or fight in close quarters, but he hated it nonetheless. Pain, either inflicted or received, was always an avoidable unpleasantry. Well, at least he wished it was avoidable. He could not avoid it now, could he? He just wished he could go to his workshop again and just work on the new tech he was building.

Just then, a drone fell just in front of the van. The wheels screeched as he made a sharp turn, and then came to a stop, just as Nataly jumped to his side. The drone slid on the road, the rotor making sparks as it continued spinning, until it came to a complete stop. His heart hammered in his chest, and he could see the percentage of it's charge getting lower more quickly than usual in the corner of his glasses. Calm down. Nataly was saying something, so he had to tell her to start again.

''Okay, again. Sorry for scaring you, but I thought it might be a good idea to shoot it in case it's a kamikaze drone.''

''I swear, Nataly, I almost had a heart attack. And my heart is from more circuitery than flesh for Christ's sake.'' An exhale formed a small cloud in front of him, quickly dissipating. He checked his heart. Eighty-seven percent. Good thing that he charged it earlier. ''ETA of the soldiers?''

''Quickly approaching. Five minutes tops.''

A quick scan around. This place would have to do. The second van should be arriving any second now, and then they could all launch an ambush. There was little cover on the road, but they would have to make do somehow. They should still have some deployable cover in the second van anyway. The road was surrounded by two story buildings alighted with neon holograms. One was for some kind of make-up that claimed to fix the skin of any impurities, with 9/10 dermatologist recommending it. He scoffed at that, recalling all the similar products he's seen since his childhood. Plus, weren't dermatologists only in the middle city? Whatever, time for combat. His squad was looking at him and Nataly warily, and the tension was palpable. They were so young. It always made Martin dissociate from reality when he was leading an ambush like this. What if he was sending men and women, barely in their twenties, to just die for some grand mission that would never be completed? But... they had to try. It was now or never. The second van braked in the street, coming in much slower than his own had, and turned sideways to serve as cover as well. Time to get ready.

He quickly gave orders to separate into groups of three and take cover in various spots. Hopefully, the cover would hold. Nataly tapped him on the shoulder. A soldier Martin picked out stood behind her. He couldn't quite manage to hide his excitement and was looking around excitedly, his weapon at the ready. But his excitement wasn't why Martin chose him.

''So what is our role, general? We hide behind the van? Don't know why you're so set on these three person groups, but hey, I'm not complaining. I finally don't have to.''

''Not behind the van. At least not you two. Meet Kern. I worked on his legs.'' He pointed at the man's legs, which ended in augments that looked similar to Nataly's. They were not so full of alternative augments that he could switch to, however. Couldn't carry the weight without augmented legs. ''I want you two to flank around the enemy on the rooftops and capture one of the soldiers. Alive. After that, try to cause as much mayhem as possible. That's it.''

''Hold on, hold on.'' Nataly sighed. ''You know as well as I do the damned Ristards don't talk. You don't remember last time?''

''I do, but.. I have to try. Plus, there's something new I want to test out. Just do it.'' He could see Nataly softening to the idea. He knew he had her.

''Please? I'll ask Timothea to make you that coffee mix you like.''

''Ugh, fine. Just don't cry when the ristard's a dead fish. Let's go, rookie.'' The asphalt clanked as they started walking towards the nearest building.

''Pleased to be working with you. I'm not a rookie, though, Miss Nataly. I've been working under Martin for a year already.''

''Did I stutter?'' was the last thing Martin heard before they quickly climbed the wall.

He checked his timer. Less than a minute remained. Time to test his new toys.

The sounds of more drones whirring in the air broke the silence. The Ristard soldiers soon followed, fully armored and armed, on the lookout for trouble. One of them held some kind of scanning device in his hand, but he'd never seen the type before, so Martin could only try to guess its capabilities. He put his Black Viper on the trunk of his van and shot the first soldier he saw in the head. The bullet came straight through and sparked on the side of the building behind.

Yet another nightmare lingered in Nataly's mind as she woke up to the beeping of her alarm. She could still feel the blood on the palms that were no longer hers. She turned the alarm off and started getting ready for today. Yesterday was hectic, so hopefully this day would not follow suit. The experiments with Viktor's drug had to be halted, as Nate died in the testing. Viktor decided that he would try running again, so Nataly had to clobber him in the back of his head to knock him out. She remembered the feeling of shock that they all must have felt when Nate suddenly collapsed and died. Well, Viktor was not shocked; he seemed to expect it. She recalled how he tried to stop Nate from going overboard though, and it came back to her that he wanted to tell her something before Martin cut him off. She could not blame this solely on him. He was locked up now, with some people saying that he was trying to get back at them for killing his gang, but it was nonsense, and Nataly would clear it up. Was she pushing too hard? Should they do safer tests at a slower pace? She closed her eyes, seeing Nate's corpse lying in front of her, shock visible on his face, in his eyes as they died out. But every minute ticked like a clock's hand, moving closer and closer to the 'evolution' of Ristards. Would they be able to stop them if she didn't push so hard and risked more deaths in testing? A bit distressed, she headed towards Martin's room. Sweat condensed into beads on her forehead from the stress, and she tried wiping it off, only for her metallic arms to make the situation worse. Great, just great.

It felt like too much was going on at once. Not only did they now have a very strict time limit in which they could try to take the Ristard towers down, but the testing was resulting in deaths. She wasn't sure she could stop everything from going to shit. Damian said he expected results soon, and she wanted them as well.

Martin Left yesterday after seeing the test fail. He did not appear sad about the failure, but more... contemplative. He said he needed to go to his lab for something, and she has not seen him since. If that man did not sleep today as well, she swore it would be she who killed him, not his lack of sleep. Her predictions were proven wrong, however, when she stood at the front of his door and heard loud snoring inside. Loud snoring that almost managed to drown out the alarm that was beeping. She knocked. No response. She knocked again, harder. The snoring stopped for just a second, just to resume again. What a bother, she sighed. If he would not wake up like a grown-up, it seemed like he would need someone to do it less nicely for him. With that thought, she entered his room, which was unlocked for whatever reason.

Martin was lying on his back, just in his underpants, barely covered by the blankets draped over his legs. What a dork. He hadn‚Äôt even taken off his glasses. But Jesus was he snoring loudly. Nataly could see his muscles clearly, with his arms under his head, covered by his long, wavy hair, his torso showing a bit of fat that didn't quite manage to hide the muscle hidden underneath. Then she felt some heat in her face. What was she, some kind of pervert, checking her sleeping colleague out while he was sleeping? This wasn't even her first time staring. Gods, was he undressing like this on purpose? Well, whatever. There was no time left before the countdown to try a new relationship anyway. She discarded the improper thoughts and kicked Martin weakly at his side. He stopped snoring and slowly opened his eyes. He then blinked a few times, finally opened his eyes, and stared at the ceiling. Then jumped off the bed, touched his chest, took a deep breath, and hurriedly started dressing.

''Jesus, Nataly. What time is it? How late am I? For fuck's sake, I need a louder alarm.''

Nataly just chuckled. ''Relax, Martin. Viktor is locked up and won't be moving anywhere until we interrogate him. Just sit. Let's talk.''

His eyes fixed on her, and relief visibly flooded over him. ''Ah, right, right. He messed up yesterday. Sorry, just woke up. Anyways, talk? Ah, right.'' He moved his singular chair in the room in front of his bed and motioned for her to sit. ''So, remember yesterday how I told you I wanted to discuss something? Well, I looked at the schematics that the soldiers so kindly offered us, and I realized..

Silence followed. ''Realized what, Martin?'' Why did he seem so excited?

A chuckle. ''Well, I realized a lot. There are great ideas there, Nataly, ideas I can bounce off of. Remember how I told you a few months ago that I wouldn't be able to upgrade your arms no more?''

''I do. And thank gods for that, my back is already hurting from carrying all this metal.''

''Well, sorry, but I would be able to upgrade them now. We don't have all the materials, and the V-Steel we would have to grab somewhere, but I could make them better.''

''Whoah. Didn't expect that. Upgrade how?''

''In a lot of ways, actually. And not only that, yesterday I realized that I can probably improve Viktor's nano-drug, although I need to discuss that with him. You think he's up yet? Oh, and lastly..''

He looked nervous, but smiled from ear to ear. ''I think I finally know how to fix my heart.'' A wink at her. ''Maybe I can give you the old one.''

Was he... Flirting? He was either too bad at this, or she just wasn't in the mood, with everything that was going on. Probably both. And so, she just pretended to not hear the last part.

Still, this was the most happy she has ever seen him. The need to charge his heart seemed annoying, but It didn't seem as terrible as Martin seemed to think of it. It seemed to be a matter of importance to him, however, for reasons he never told her. She hated the feeling of things being hidden from her, especially by her best friend, but she never tried to pry. He would tell her when he was ready. Just as she would tell him of her past when she was ready in turn.

''Umm, hello? Anyone home?'' He knocked on her forehead, to which she gave him her best glare in return.

''Okay, Martin, that was a lot of information to unpack right there, so let's write down a plan, okay?

''Okay, okay. Let me grab my tablet, one sec.'' He stood up and went over to his table.

''Also, how the fuck do you want to get V-Steel? Only the Ristards and the inner city snobs have it, you know that, right? And as for Viktor..''

Her phone beeped in her pocket. She quickly connected it to her left eye and answered it. ''Well, hello there, Nataly.'' Damian chimed in with a warm voice. ''Need you and Martin ready to go, in twenty minutes. Got it?''

Nataly sighed. She would have to finish this conversation with Martin later. Was it just her, or have the last few important conversations been getting interrupted lately?

''Got it.'' She told Martin about her call, and with that, she left towards the Armory.

-------------------------------

Only a few things in his life left Viktor in this much pain. He couldn't recall if his head ever hurt this much. He found it a bit funny that this thought came from a man with a hole in his skull. He woke up an hour ago. His clock showed it was well past 9 a.m. already, and he should be eating his breakfast right now. That meant one of two things. Either miss Nataly was late, which just could not be the case. But it was either that, or she decided he was not useful anymore after yesterday. If that was the case, then he was properly screwed. Just when he was growing fond of this place, and managing to get a teeny bit closer to his two superiors. He would miss his free coffee in the afterlife, if there was one.

When he woke up, he tried to go and find Nataly to explain that it wasn't his fault yesterday. He tried to warn her. Yes, he could have brought it up again, but gods was she scary, and his past experiences with interrupting his bosses told him to just drop it. He should have brought it up again, though. When he tried to go out of his room, he was shoved in by two men in grey suits and told to not exit until he was called on. He tried explaining, but his voice fell on deaf ears. So he just sat on his bed and thought about his life. How it was fucked up, got better, got fucked up, and then better yet again. Maybe this was his third bad time, and he would... yeah, no. Well, Martin seemed to like him. He even called him 'Vik', and honestly, he would die for that man when he first called him that. Not literally, but yeah..

No plan to escape now, huh? There was nothing in this room. Plus, even if he escaped, Miss Nataly would surely just hunt him down again. A new thought settled in, though, a thought that surprised even him. He remembered the years of shit he had to go through because he wasn't lucky enough to be born in the inner parts of the city. The rage he felt throughout his whole life, suppressed by the happy drugs. The thoughts of hate he felt returning again, and again, and again. He embraced the hatred now, letting it cover him like a blanket. As be thought about his life until this point, one thing became clear to him.

Even if he died, he still appreciated it. He appreciated the fact that he might have helped take the inner city down.",1,1755870476.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1mx6z08,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1mx6z08/explore_best_electric_kettle_fellow_corvo_ekg_pro/,Explore Best Electric Kettle Fellow Corvo EKG Pro Worth the Hype,"Fellow 1171PRO-MB arrived at my doorstep a few weeks ago, and since then, it has become an indispensable part of my daily routine. I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôve been through my fair share of electric kettles over the years, but this one stands out for its premium build, thoughtful features, and impressive performance. As someone who relies on a steady flow of tea to fuel my day‚Äîand occasionally ventures into fancier coffee brewing‚ÄîI was eager to see if this matte black beauty could live up to its reputation.

**Impressions of Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the kettle‚Äôs sleek, modern aesthetic caught my eye. The matte finish gives it an understated elegance that feels right at home in my minimalist kitchen. Its compact dimensions‚Äîjust under 9 inches tall and about 7 inches wide‚Äîmake it a great fit for smaller countertops, but it makes no sacrifices in terms of usability. I appreciated the solid weight of the kettle at around 3.86 pounds, which adds a reassuring durability. The handle, crafted for ergonomic support, felt great in my hand, and the wide spout was a game-changer for controlled pouring. Even during a chaotic morning rush, this kettle makes it easy to get things just right.  

[Check Fellow 1171PRO-MB price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b0bz59157h/)  

**Precision Temperature Controls That Deliver**  
The standout feature for me has to be the to-the-degree temperature control. I've tested it for green tea at 180¬∞F, a hearty French press coffee at 205¬∞F, and even instant oatmeal water at a slightly cooler setting for my child. Each time, it nailed the exact temperature I wanted, making the experience nearly foolproof. The high-resolution LCD screen deserves praise as well‚Äîit‚Äôs clear, easy to navigate, and surprisingly intuitive. Whether fiddling with altitude modes or customizing settings like hold temperature, it feels like a high-tech touch that‚Äôs user-friendly for both techies and non-techies.

**Tailored Scheduling and Intuitive Display**  
One feature my family keeps joking about‚Äîthough we all secretly love‚Äîis the scheduling option. Being able to set the kettle to boil at just the right time in the morning has genuinely elevated our mornings. The full-color display made tweaking these settings enjoyable rather than complicated, offering everything from timer modes to temperature unit adjustments (yes, my partner and I argue over Fahrenheit vs. Celsius). I even used the Brew Stopwatch feature to time our weekend pour-over brews down to the second, which was as satisfying as it was geeky.  

**Advantages**  
- Precise temperature control for various drinks and foods  
- Versatile scheduling and intuitive interface with a high-res color display  
- Ergonomic handle and wide spout for a smooth, controlled pour  
- Built with durable 304 stainless steel and food-grade silicone  

**Disadvantages**  
- Not dishwasher safe, requiring hand washing for regular care  
- The price could feel steep compared to standard electric kettles  
- Occasional firmware update prompts via the Wi-Fi app could annoy users  

**Competing Products in the Market**  
While Fellow 1171PRO-MB is undoubtedly impressive, it faces stiff competition from brands such as Breville and Cuisinart. The Breville Smart Kettle comes close in terms of temperature controls but lacks the sleek design and intuitive LCD display. On the other hand, Cuisinart‚Äôs PerfecTemp kettle offers presets for various teas but feels bulkier and less modern than the one from Fellow. Where this kettle pulls ahead, though, is in its combination of precise controls, aesthetic appeal, and additional customization options like altitude mode. It also helps that its wide spout and ergonomic handle make pouring a joy‚Äîsomething I find less seamless with its competitors.

**Smart Spending Potential**  
At first glance, the product‚Äôs price might make you hesitate. Once you factor in the features, though, it feels like a smart investment for anyone serious about brewing the perfect beverage. The combination of customizable controls, durability, and premium finish sets it apart from basic kettles on the market. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest option, it undoubtedly shines in terms of offering unparalleled precision and usability. If you‚Äôre someone who values both style and substance in your kitchen gadgets, this electric kettle justifies the spend.

Checked my fuel pump fuse, that was fine, replaced the original DME Relay with a new, cheap one, still didn't work. 

Took out the reference/speed sensors. Reference sensor looked fine but speed sensor looked awful with a ripped connection beneath a pound of electrical tape from the original owner a few years ago. 

Replaced both of these sensors and did continuity tests to the DME, reference didn't pass now but the speed sensor was good. 

Took out the DME (got hit in the head by the altitude sensor on the way down), and did continuity tests back to the sensors on the wiring harness - reference still failed, but spreed remained good. I was happy that it might not have been a computer issue, because that looked very costly, but I was afraid of the spaghetti monster inside the wiring harness might be. I went back upfront because it was likely a cabling issue there since I didn't figure how damage would happen on the inside, unplugged reference sensor, realized I couldn't plug it back in, so checked it closer with a light. Bunch of dry-rotted plastic build up inside the female connector wasn't letting the contacts touch lol.

Now it fires up well and I can finally go to my first cars and coffee tomorrow 8/22 which I was supposed to be at on 8/2. Keeping the original DME Relay as a spare incase the new one craps out since I suppose it wasn't the issue. Pretty proud.

My closest and bestfriend ditched me in a way I didn't even know was possible. I don't think I ever imagined being cared for again. I completely had given up on having friends. I just wanted to stay inside my room and do nothing. Be free -I wanted to escape so bad it was insane.

I was always planning ways to disappear from my current life - but I couldn't bc I didn't have the resources. School was literal living hell...and honestly im so proud of myself for making it thru cuz I know it hasn't have been easy.

Right now, I have the most amazing friends. It really hit me when I was moving behind while the group went ahead - and then, one friend just stopped and came back just for me. I know it's a small thing but it really means a lot to me to be loved like this. I think the past few weeks have been amazing - and exam szn is coming up and I'm like so fucking excited. I love my friends- I love feeling included. I love sitting in those big groups and playing chess or uno cards. I love being a teenager and doing teenage stuff. I love that my friends don't gossip a lot. I love that I am no longer trying to prevent myself from being in the present moment. I am living in the now and it's amazing. Man that feeling of gratefulness when you realise people you care about - care about you too. Its nice.  
Last year, I thought it was terrible what my ex-bsf did, but now I look at it - it makes sense why god would teach me that lesson. I was an overly attached person, I had invested ALL my social energy into one person. I was always trying to fix our relationship - ""Please lmk if you're mad we can fix it"" type shi. A lot of gaslighting there too. But now I know I'll never end up in that situation because it's like I love my friends but im very grounded in my own presence too. I don't associate friendship=everything. The world has a lot to offer and I like it. I like knowing my friends are genuinely good people. I want to live my life now.

My new friends show me that conversations don't always have to be ""gossip"" to be interesting. We talk about ideas, our plans in life and sm more. My ex bsf had good conversation skills but she gossiped wayyy too much (she cannot name ONE person in her life who she hasn't gossiped about - and weirdly shes aware about it too).

I know my classmates will never see this - but I really love you guys. I love giving presentations in front of you guys, I love seeing you get full marks on your tests, I love seeing you win, I love knowing you exist. I love your sweetness and I genuinely think you guys are beautiful to your core. I know we aren't all that close but thank you for accepting me at my lowest - and loving me despite not knowing how genuinely depressed i was.

You don't know the depths of hell you pulled me out of - thank you for being you. Thank you to god. Thank you to those self help YouTubers who tell you to not insult yourself every time you look at yourself in the mirror. Thank you for everyone -especially my family - for seeing my worst phases and being with me. I know you guys weren't the best parents - but at the end of the day, you're just human beings too. How mad can I be? I know you tried your best and I know your childhood wasn't easy - I hope I can be the daughter you want me to be.  
I love you all. I love my math tuition teacher too thank you man you genuinely helped me sm. Thank you to my friends for genuinely including me and saving a seat.  
God really saved me when he pulled me out of those friend groups that gossip about each other - so thank you god.

Thank you to my new friends you guys are fucking amazing and I love my classmates. Theres something so comforting about it. Our class is genuinely like a warm cup of coffee on a wintery morning. I'm genuinely so blessed to have you guys - thank you.

You'd see me last year and you'd think I'm just gonna kms myself the next morning -  and honestly some of my ex-friends' would've genuinely enjoyed that news. I was really depressed, skipping classes and teachers felt like they had to tell other kids to talk to me since I wasn't socialising enough. I cried every time I reached home. In school too.  My ex friend group LITERALLY did everything to destroy me - cut off EVERY connection, gossiped CONSTANTLY about me, and did everything to harass me. I literally can't explain that feeling of seeing someone who you considered your closest angel try to ruin your life - like you're supposed to be the saviour not the fucking reason I'm drowning in the damn first place.

My lesson was realising that I am my own saviour - not some bsf. I am whole as a person. The fact that I still managed to join a friend group and hang around my school despite losing all my connections makes me proud. Not only did I lose connections - my exfriend group made sure I had enemies in every class. Being able to overcome that is insane - like imagine you get a whole grade to hate on a kid and they're STILL out there thriving.

I don't know exactly when and how I stopped being the ""lonely, no friends"" kid - but I'm so grateful.

I genuinely didn't know how to survive without a ""bestfriend"" - but now I do, and it's grounding. The main lesson I learnt is to bask in my own little sunlight and just grow that garden - I don't need any other.

We genuinely need to normalise enjoying your own presence before you start spending time with other people. Thank you to my classmates for making me feel loved and respected. Thank you.",3,1755869941.0,Positivity,0,1.0,False

1mx6qtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1mx6qtv/investigate_if_camco_tastepure_rv_water_filter/,Investigate if Camco Tastepure RV Water Filter lives up to the review hype!,"The **Camco 40045 Tastepure RV Water Filter** caught my attention as a camping enthusiast in desperate need of clean drinking water on the go. It turns out this product isn't just another filter‚Äîit became a key player in making my outdoor adventures more enjoyable. Testing it over several road trips revealed some genuine highs‚Äîand a few points you'll want to consider.

**Compact Design and Ease of Setup**  
One of the standout features of this filter is how easily it integrates into any setup. With a simple inline attachment design, it takes almost no effort to connect it to a standard garden or drinking water hose. Even someone like me, with a zero-tolerance level for struggle during setup, found it hassle-free. Its portability makes it an ideal companion for RV trips or outdoor events, and the blue plastic casing is durable enough to handle bumps and jostles without issue. A neat extra? These filters come in a pack of two‚Äîa bonus for anyone gearing up for multiple trips.

[Grab Camco 40045 Tastepure RV Water Filter at the best price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0024e6v30/)

**Advanced 6-Step Filtration Technology**  
This patent-protected six-step filtration system doesn't just filter water‚Äîit feels like I‚Äôve upgraded my hydration game. On my first camping trip with the filter, the noticeable improvement in taste hit me right away. It removes chlorine, sediment, and even unpleasant odors that could otherwise ruin your coffee in the morning. Plus, the inclusion of KDF (Kinetic Degradation Fluxion) media to control bacteria and mold holds up even when the filter isn‚Äôt in regular use. Under tough RV road-trip conditions, this filtration system seriously impressed me‚Äîno weird aftertaste, just fresh, clean water.

**Certified Reliability**  
Another win for these filters comes down to their rigorous testing and certification. Knowing they meet NSF/ANSI standards 42 and 53 for filtering undesirable elements is reassuring, especially when you're consuming water from unknown sources. They‚Äôre also certified lead-free to NSF/ANSI 372 standards, which kept me at ease while refilling water bottles for my kids‚Äîand pouring a bowl for the family dog.

**Performance in Real-World Conditions**  
While camping in dusty environments, the built-in 20-micron sediment filter really proved its worth. My previous filters always struggled, clogging up and slowing water flow. In contrast, this one kept the water running efficiently, thanks to a wide-body design improving flow rate. I even used the filter for car washing, and it helped minimize water spots‚Äîunexpected but very welcome.

**Winning Points**  
- Easy to install and use, even for first-timers.  
- Dual-pack gives you value and backup readiness.  
- Patented six-step filtration effectively neutralizes chlorine and sediments.  
- High durability ensures it withstands the rigors of travel.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The plastic casing, while reasonably strong, might not survive extensive exposure to harsh outdoor conditions.  
- Its lifespan per filter could be better, as it depends heavily on water quality and usage levels.  
- The product doesn't include a flexible hose protector, which some might find inconvenient.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing the Camco Tastepure water filter to the Clear2O Inline RV Water Filter, I noticed some distinct advantages. Clear2O offers similar certifications and great filtering quality, but its significantly higher price tag piles up over time, especially for those like me who rely on frequent replacements. The Camco filters were easier to attach and provided comparable filtration, making them more practical for budget-conscious buyers. Meanwhile, products like the Culligan RV-800 were more compact but lacked the same 20-micron sediment filter, which I‚Äôve grown to appreciate. It‚Äôs the perfect middle-ground product between affordability and capability.

**Price Worthiness**  
For the cost, you're getting a lot here‚Äîtwo filters, reliable performance, and proven filtration technology. Some higher-end competitors might offer slightly more robust casing or longer lifespans, but they might also drain your wallet unnecessarily. This product strikes solid balance: it‚Äôs more than just affordable; it‚Äôs cost-effective. The portability, certifications, and thoughtful design make this an investment that pays off for your camping, RVing, or even washing your car.

1mx6pyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mx6pyq/what_makes_eight_oclock_coffee_medium_roast_kcup/,What makes Eight O'Clock Coffee Medium Roast K-Cup Pods worth your review?,"I‚Äôve been using the Eight O'Clock Coffee 5000346165 The Original, Keurig Single Serve K-Cup Pods, Medium Roast (72 Count) for a few weeks now, and let me say, it‚Äôs been a pretty interesting experience. As someone who loves coffee but doesn't have the patience for brewing a whole pot in the morning, these single-serve pods have been a lifesaver. They promise convenience and quality, and for the most part, they deliver. That said, there are some quirks that stood out during my testing sessions.

**Packaging and Design**  
The first thing that really stood out to me was the packaging. The box contains six packs of 12 K-Cup pods, which stack neatly on my pantry shelf. They‚Äôre lightweight, compact, and don‚Äôt take up much space. The pods themselves are clearly labeled and sealed well to lock in freshness, which is great for someone like me who appreciates consistency in my morning routine. I also like that they are recyclable, but the process isn‚Äôt as straightforward as I expected. You‚Äôre supposed to peel, empty, and recycle, but not all communities accept them, so you might want to check before tossing them in the bin.  

**Flavor and Aroma**  
One thing I love about this coffee is the bold aroma that fills my kitchen while it brews. It‚Äôs like the smell of a high-end coffee shop but in the comfort of my home. The flavor is described as ""outstandingly smooth yet full-bodied with a complex finish,"" and honestly, I‚Äôd have to agree. The medium roast strikes a nice balance‚Äîit‚Äôs not too strong or too light‚Äîmaking it perfect for casual coffee drinkers as well as enthusiasts. I‚Äôve gone through several cups and noticed that the flavor doesn‚Äôt vary from one pod to another, which speaks volumes about its quality. That consistency is something I greatly appreciate.

**Compatibility and Convenience**  
These pods are compatible with Keurig K-Cup pod single-serve coffee makers, which is what I use every day. The brewing process with the Keurig machine is hassle-free and quick. From inserting the pod to having a steaming hot cup of coffee in hand, it takes just a few moments. If you rely on efficiency in your morning routine, this aspect cannot be overstated. However, I noticed that the pods don‚Äôt work as well with some off-brand machines, so it‚Äôs worth double-checking compatibility if you don‚Äôt own a Keurig.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Outstanding aroma and full-bodied flavor that doesn‚Äôt overwhelm.  
- Convenient single-serve pods fit seamlessly into busy mornings.  
- Recyclable pods are a step toward sustainability (though not universally recyclable).  

[Check Eight O'Clock Coffee 5000346165 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00i08jki2/)

**Performance Over Time**  
After using it consistently, I‚Äôve found that the taste doesn‚Äôt get old or monotonous. It‚Äôs like having a reliable coffee shop visit each morning without leaving the house. However, this familiarity can also have a downside‚Äîif you‚Äôre someone who loves experimenting with different coffee styles, these pods might feel limiting after a while. For people who stick to what they know and love, though, this product offers a great option.  

**Downsides**  
- Not the most recyclable product unless you live in certain areas.  
- Limited versatility for those who prefer different brewing styles.  
- Might not work well with non-Keurig coffee makers.  

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing Eight O'Clock Coffee pods with other single-serve coffee options, I think they hold their own pretty well. Starbucks K-Cups, for instance, also offer a bold flavor and a slightly higher-end feel. However, the aroma of the Original Medium Roast from Eight O'Clock Coffee feels richer to me. Green Mountain pods are another competitor, but I find they can be too mild for my liking. While Eight O'Clock doesn't feel overly premium, it delivers an excellent balance of flavor and affordability that I haven‚Äôt seen in pricier alternatives like Peet‚Äôs K-Cups.  

**True Value**  
For what it offers‚Äîconvenience, consistency, and a satisfying cup of coffee‚Äîthe price point feels reasonable. This is especially true when compared to the cost of regularly going to a caf√© or subscribing to more premium brands. Even if there are some minor trade-offs, like limited pod recyclability, the overall experience still delivers good value for home coffee enthusiasts.

‚ö†Ô∏è Trigger Warning

This is the weekly recap of the monetized posts from Kylea and Joseph ""Joe"" Gomez of Kylea G, You Grow Girl from 08/08/25-08/14/25.  

Disclaimers: I am not a physician, influencer, or paid content creator.  I am not affiliated with WW.  I have no background in law; however, I am semi-retired from the healthcare field with multiple college degrees.  These opinions are my own based on social media content.  I wish no harm to Kylea & Joe Gomez or Kylea's legal team.

üëã everyone!  Did Kylea have a busy and blessed week during their staycation?  Let's find out...

Takeout & Shopping 

08/08 Homegoods- 2 Halloween coffee mugs (""Joe"" picked out & purchased 08/07 but she posted today); Thrift shopping- long, short-sleeved green dress (similar to the one purchased for Sweet Mama for Easter that was not Kylea's style at the time); She assembled the two patio chairs

08/09 Rib Crib smoked meat for dinner & 2 pieces of pie from an unknown restaurant; Awkward video about new coasters; Announced she will purchase a new living room rug; Hobby Lobby- 2 pumpkin pillows, a fall pillow cover & new outdoor sign for the ""front porch""

08/10 7 Brew for Kylea before church; New table delivered by her paternal grandma

08/11 7 Brew for Kylea; Bath & Body Works- 5 hand soaps shown; Hobby Lobby- table runner & placemats; Plain & Simple Decor- wall art (this was not custom-made for Kylea) 

08/14 Scooters for Kylea; Judy Blue jeans & two fuzzy cardigans

Travel

We were treated to multiple reminders about their upcoming Colorado trip. ü•± 

Pets, Family & Religion

08/08 Birdie was groomed and was shown in a new pink harness/leash set. 

08/10 Kylea allegedly went to 1st service with a friend and Joe went to late service alone.  Her paternal grandma allegedly ate dinner at their apartment but was never shown.

08/11 Kylea announced that her dog will be 17-months-old next week. 

08/13 Her half-sister visited from Nashville and allegedly ate dinner at their apartment but was never shown

*Kylea announced she will take treats to the nursing home in October to honor the birthday of Grams (her maternal grandma who passed away 18 mo. ago). 

*08/08-08/14 No video content was posted of Birdie on a walk, playing with her toys/puzzles/ball pit or swimming pool.  The cats, Alice & Oliver, were not shown on video, and there were ZERO posts dedicated to them.

Health & Fitness

08/08-08/14 No content was posted showing Joe at the gym; She marked his 6-month gym anniversary; No walking pad content was shared; No content was shared showing Kylea on a walk to elevate her heart rate. 

For some odd reason, Kylea decided to share when she showers again???  This basic hygiene event occurred 08/02, 08/05, 08/10, and 08/14...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Although she pushed the anemia/always cold story arc this week, she kept posting images of herself barefoot in dressing rooms, trying on short-sleeve clothes, or wearing T-shirts/shorts/short-sleeved nightgowns in her nontent. ü§î 

Bear Hollow Supply üçø 

Kylea tagged Bear Hollow Supply (the maker of the cast aluminum table legs) on Instagram, they shared one of her posts about the table on Facebook, Facebook comments rolled in, the owner looked into the Catfish episode, never doxxed Kylea in his video statement and clarified she was not paid by his company and they have no partnership.  Joe was never mentioned. Kylea then decided to leave a 1 star review about the owner instead of evaluating the actual product.  Over 1200 people downvoted her review. 

Final Thoughts

Kylea made a huge deal about rotating her closet to fall/winter this week due to their ""busy"" schedules, although the weather in Joplin will remain warm into fall and she spends her days busily making her butt imprint on the custom sectional deeper...

She posted many Fall/Halloween items she didn't purchase.  Is she living in the moment and enjoying summer?

What about all the ultra-processed/calorie-dense triggering food products she posted? Did you find them beneficial to your health journey?  Aren't you forever proud of her? This medical marvel can eat AnYtHiNg, chug soda, and coffee milkshakes, walk less, sit more, and still not gain an ounce for multiple years. Sounds like she's UNlocked the secret code to weight loss, aka photo modification and body image issues. She is a cautionary tale.‚úåÔ∏è 

‚òéÔ∏è If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, please call or text 988 for assistance.  Please speak with a medical professional about any questions or concerns you have about your health.  Please contact a veterinarian about any questions or concerns you have about your pet(s).

i'm interested in gaming, general nerd stuff, dnd, yoga, spirituality, psychology, philosophy/ethics and religion, debate, lgbt events, i'm looking to get into the gym and will be interested in looking at/trying out sports although im hesitant to look at any non gay-friendly sports based on past history. love live music although im nervous to go alone to new events. potentially looking to try things like hiking and more outdoorsy stuff too, although i need to maybe work up to it with my fitness first

i'm interested potentially in book clubs, coffee meets. im looking both for potential hobbies but also just to be social, so anything people can recommend would be appreciated :)

  
i'd like to generally find out what kind of stuff is available, and if anyone has any kind of hobbies they think could be interesting for me that arent directly in that list, i'm still very open to them

It was thick and heavy now, like velvet, smothering the little sounds that once defined their life together. The clink of Jack‚Äôs wedding ring against his coffee mug, the whisper of Emma‚Äôs socks on the hardwood, the sigh of the old house settling. All of it was gone, absorbed into this new, profound quiet. They ate breakfast across from each other at the small oak table, the one they‚Äôd bought at a flea market during a weekend so full of laughter it felt like a memory from someone else‚Äôs life. Now, the table was a battlefield, the salt and pepper shakers the only soldiers left standing.

It was Emma who finally broke. ""I made an appointment.""

Jack didn't look up from his toast. He was meticulously buttering it, right to the edges, a habit he‚Äôd never had before. ""Oh?""

""With a counselor,"" she said, her voice small. ""For us. Her name is Dr. Brennan. Everyone says she‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a miracle worker.""

For the first time in what felt like weeks, he lifted his eyes to meet hers. There was no anger in them, no defensiveness. Just a weary sort of curiosity. ""Okay,"" he said, and the single word was an armistice. A concession. A flicker of hope in the velvet dark.

Dr. Brennan‚Äôs office was a study in tranquility. Soft grays and muted blues, a single orchid on the windowsill, chairs so comfortable you felt your grievances soften the moment you sat down. Dr. Brennan herself was a woman of indeterminate age, with kind eyes and a voice like warm honey. She didn‚Äôt take sides. She didn‚Äôt assign blame. She gave them tools. Words. Phrases like ""I feel"" instead of ""you did."" She taught them about validation, about active listening, about creating a ""shared narrative.""

And it worked. It was astonishing how quickly it worked. The silence in their house retreated, replaced by careful, structured conversations. Jack started looking at her when she spoke. He started making coffee in the morning again, remembering she liked a half-teaspoon of sugar. They started holding hands. The first time he did it, lacing his fingers through hers as they walked out of Dr. Brennan's office after their fourth session, Emma almost wept with relief. The miracle was real. The woman was saving them.

To celebrate their two-month anniversary of ""the work,"" Jack took her to Coq d'Or, a place they hadn't been to since their actual anniversary two years prior. The restaurant was buzzing, warm light glinting off wine glasses. It felt like coming up for air.

""To us,"" Jack said, raising his glass. He smiled, a genuine, crinkling-at-the-corners smile she hadn't seen in forever. ""And to Dr. Brennan.""

""To Dr. Brennan,"" Emma agreed, clinking her glass against his.

As she sipped her wine, her eyes drifted across the room. She saw another couple, seated by the window. She recognized them vaguely from Dr. Brennan's waiting room. The wife was talking, her hands animated. The husband was listening, his head tilted at a precise forty-five-degree angle, his expression one of placid interest. He reached across the table and placed his hand on his wife's forearm, a gesture of reassurance.

Emma felt a prickle of unease. She watched his hand. Thumb on top, fingers gently curled underneath. She looked at Jack. His own hand was resting on her arm. In the exact same way. Thumb on top, fingers gently curled underneath. The gesture he'd started using last week.

She laughed, a little nervously. ""That‚Äôs funny. That guy over there, the way he‚Äôs touching her arm. It‚Äôs the same way you‚Äôre touching mine.""

Jack glanced over. He smiled his new, patient smile. ""It's one of the nonverbal validation techniques. Dr. Brennan must teach it to all her couples. It‚Äôs effective, isn't it?""

""Yes,"" Emma said, the word feeling strange in her mouth. ""Effective.""

She tried to push it away. It was nothing. It was a technique. Like a specific tennis serve or a yoga pose. A tool. That‚Äôs all it was. But the image of the two men, mirror images of placid support, stayed with her. A crack in the perfect new facade of their marriage. So small she could cover it with a thumb. So small she could pretend it wasn‚Äôt there at all.

The cracks began to spread.

It wasn't one big thing. It was a thousand tiny things, a slow poisoning of the mundane. Jack's posture changed. He now stood with his shoulders perfectly squared, a model of calm confidence. He adopted a new laugh, a soft, controlled chuckle that never quite reached his eyes. It replaced the loud, uninhibited bark of a laugh she had fallen in love with. When she mentioned it, he just smiled. ""Dr. Brennan says my old laugh was a defense mechanism. A way of deflecting.""

They ran into the Hollises, another of Dr. Brennan‚Äôs couples, at the farmer‚Äôs market. Mrs. Hollis was lamenting the price of heirloom tomatoes, and Mr. Hollis listened with that same precise tilt of the head Emma had seen in the restaurant. When his wife finished speaking, he nodded slowly. ""I hear that you feel frustrated by the cost,"" he said, his voice a gentle, uninflected monotone. ""That is a valid feeling.""

Emma felt a cold dread wash over her. It was a script. They were all working from the same script.

That night, she tried to talk to Jack. She kept her voice light, casual. ""It's strange, isn't it? How all of Dr. Brennan's couples seem so‚Ä¶ similar?""

Jack was loading the dishwasher, arranging the plates in neat, symmetrical rows. He didn't turn around. ""She has a system, Em. It‚Äôs a methodology that works. We should trust the process.""

""I know, but‚Ä¶ the way Mr. Hollis spoke to his wife. It was word for word what you said to me yesterday when I was upset about my boss. 'I hear that you feel‚Ä¶'""

He finally turned, wiping his hands on a dish towel. His face held that now-familiar expression of deep, unassailable patience. It was an expression that left no room for her own feelings. ""It's called a reflective listening statement. It‚Äôs designed to de-escalate conflict and validate the speaker. You‚Äôre seeing conspiracy where there‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ effective communication."" He took a step closer, his voice softening. ""Honey, Dr. Brennan warned us this might happen. When one partner begins to heal and change, the other can sometimes feel destabilized. You might be feeling some resistance to the positive changes. We can bring it up in our next session. We can work through it together.""

He was using the therapy against her. He was taking her fear, her genuine, gut-level wrongness, and recasting it as a symptom of her own dysfunction. She felt a wave of psychological vertigo. Was she crazy? Was she so broken that she couldn't accept her husband becoming a better man? She looked at this calm, reasonable person in front of her, this man who remembered to take out the recycling and always said the right thing, and felt utterly, terrifyingly alone. How could she explain it to anyone? ""My husband is finally the man I always wanted him to be, and it horrifies me."" She would sound insane. Ungrateful.

The house, their sanctuary, began to feel like a stage. Every interaction was a performance. Jack moved through the rooms with a placid grace, a stranger in a familiar skin. He held his coffee mug differently now, both hands wrapped around it as if warming them, a gesture she‚Äôd never seen him make in fifteen years. He started buying a different brand of soap, one with almost no scent. Clinical. He remembered every anniversary, every birthday, not with the last-minute panic she was used to, but with a quiet, efficient foresight that felt completely alien. He was perfect. He was a monster.

The opportunity came on a Tuesday. Dr. Brennan had ""prescribed"" a solo weekend retreat for Jack, to ""focus on individual growth and self-actualization."" The silence he left behind was different. It wasn‚Äôt the heavy, velvet silence of their cold war; it was thin and sharp, brittle with Emma's anxiety.

She found the notebook in his home office, a room she rarely entered. It was a simple black Moleskine, tucked under a stack of papers. *Jack - Session Notes*, the label read in Dr. Brennan's neat print. Her heart hammered against her ribs. It was a violation. A betrayal of the very trust they were supposed to be rebuilding. She opened it anyway.

The first dozen pages were in Jack‚Äôs familiar, chaotic scrawl. Jagged letters, angry slashes of ink. *E. doesn't listen. Feels like she doesn't respect me. Work is a nightmare. Feel stuck.* It was him. The angry, unhappy man she knew.

Then, the writing began to change.

Slowly at first. The loops on his 'g's grew rounder. The slant became more uniform. Then came the practice pages. Page after page of drills, like a child learning cursive. A row of perfect, identical 'a's. A row of 'b's. Then, copied sentences, over and over.

*I will validate her feelings.* *I will demonstrate active listening.* *Affection is a learned behavior.* *A shared narrative creates a stable environment.*

Emma felt the air leave her lungs. This wasn't therapy. This was reprogramming.

She kept turning the pages, her hands shaking. The handwriting was completely different now. A fluid, elegant script she had never seen before. It detailed memories. Their first date. Their honeymoon in Italy. But the details were slightly off. He described her wearing a blue dress on their first date; she had worn green. He wrote about a specific pasta dish in Florence they‚Äôd never eaten. These weren‚Äôt his memories. They were approximations. Forgeries.

Near the back of the book, a single page was clipped to the rest. It was a clinical assessment form, filled out in Dr. Brennan‚Äôs hand. Under the patient's name, it didn't say Jack. It said, *Mark J.*

At the bottom of the page, a handwritten note: *Subject J. is making excellent progress on the transition. The base personality's residual anger is almost entirely suppressed. Next week, we'll begin the final phase of memory integration.*

Mark J. The name scraped at the edges of her memory. Where had she seen it before? She ran to the junk drawer in the kitchen, pulling out a thick manila folder labeled *Apartment Docs*. Inside was a stack of old mail addressed to the previous tenant, things the post office had never stopped delivering. She riffled through them. *Mark Jennings.*

Her blood ran cold. She grabbed her laptop, her fingers fumbling on the keys as she typed the name into the search bar. The first hit was a news article from two years ago.

*Local Man in Apparent Murder-Suicide.*

The article was brief. Mark Jennings and his wife, Eleanor, found in their apartment. No signs of forced entry. A picture of the couple smiled up at her from the screen. A handsome man. A woman with kind eyes and familiar, shoulder-length brown hair. A woman who looked, with a sickening jolt, almost exactly like her.

The sound of the key in the front door made her scream.

Jack was home. He was standing in the doorway of the office, holding a small bouquet of daisies. He wasn't supposed to be back until Sunday. He looked from her terrified face to the open notebook on the desk. He didn't look angry. He didn't look surprised.

He simply smiled. That calm, placid, terrible smile.

""Ah,"" he said, his voice soft as felt. ""You found the coursework. I was wondering how to approach this. Dr. Brennan says the partner's integration can be the most delicate phase.""

He took a step into the room, setting the flowers down on the corner of the desk. He moved with a serene, unhurried grace.

""Jack, who is Mark Jennings?"" she whispered, the words catching in her throat.

""Mark was a very unhappy man,"" he said, his voice a gentle murmur, the voice of a therapist, the voice of Dr. Brennan. ""Just like Jack was. They were‚Ä¶ incompatible with a happy life. Full of anger. Flawed. This is better. An upgrade.""

""What did you do?"" she choked out. ""What did she do to him?""

""She didn't do anything *to* him, Emma. She helped him. She helped *us*. All of us. She helps people find a better way to be. She takes broken things and makes them whole."" He gestured around the tidy office, the peaceful room, the quiet house. ""Isn't this better? No more fighting. No more silence. Just‚Ä¶ peace. The life you wanted.""

He was Jack. He looked like Jack, sounded mostly like Jack. But the person, the angry, flawed, difficult, beautiful person she had married, was gone. He had been hollowed out, scraped clean, and this serene stranger had been poured into the shell.

He stepped toward her and placed his hand on her arm. Thumb on top, fingers gently curled underneath. The touch was warm, firm, and utterly reptilian.

""Don't you feel how much better things are now?"" he asked, his head tilted at that precise, practiced angle.

Emma looked into her husband‚Äôs eyes and saw nothing there she recognized. Nothing but the placid, peaceful reflection of the woman he was programmed to love.

1mx6les,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerStationHub/comments/1mx6les/reveal_the_performance_of_yamaha_hphmt5_monitor/,Reveal the Performance of Yamaha HPH-MT5 Monitor Headphones!,"Yamaha HPH-MT5 is a name I‚Äôve come across quite often in my quest for the perfect pair of monitor headphones. Being someone who spends considerable time mixing tracks and fine-tuning audio recordings, reliable headphones aren‚Äôt just a want‚Äîthey‚Äôre a need. When I finally put these headphones on and spent a couple of weeks using them, there was plenty to love, but also some quirks worth mentioning.

**Sleek and Thoughtful Design**

The first thing that stood out when I unboxed Yamaha HPH-MT5 was its clean, no-frills design. At just 250 grams, it feels lightweight, which is something I appreciated during extended sessions. The closed-back, circumaural build snugly encases the ears, providing both comfort and excellent noise isolation. I often found myself immersed, even in noisy environments, whether working on audio projects at my desk or focusing on tunes in a bustling coffee shop. However, the ear cushions could be a tad softer, as I noticed slight fatigue after wearing them for hours nonstop.

**Audio Quality That Stays True to the Source**

One thing I look for in professional headphones is how faithfully they replicate the source audio. The Yamaha HPH-MT5 certainly delivers here. The 40 mm custom drivers with CCAW voice coils perform admirably, spanning a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Listening to my recordings, I experienced clear mids, precise highs, and a bass that wasn‚Äôt exaggerated‚Äîperfect for mixing. Even minor imperfections in a track became noticeable, which turned out to be both a blessing and a curse. While these headphones are fantastic for critical listening, they might not appeal to someone seeking the rich bass punch of consumer-grade headphones.

**Perfect for Lengthy Monitoring Sessions**

These headphones have been designed with studio professionals in mind, especially those like me who rely on consistent monitoring for hours. They brought minimal fatigue during my sessions, something that doesn‚Äôt always happen with higher-end headphones that prioritize fidelity over comfort. That said, the lightweight construction is both a pro and a con. While it‚Äôs great for reducing strain, it doesn‚Äôt have the premium feel of heavier, sturdier competitors. The headphones don‚Äôt scream ‚Äúluxury‚Äù but excel in practicalities, such as portability, with their detachable cable and included carrying bag.

**Strengths**

- Balanced sound profile well-suited for professional mixing and monitoring.
- Lightweight and comfortable for extended use.
- Great isolation with its closed-back design, ensuring external noise stays out.  
- Detachable 3-meter straight cable provides flexibility in studio setups.  
- Compact and easy to carry, with an included storage bag for convenience.

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- Ear cushions could be softer for prolonged comfort.  
- Build quality, while sufficient, doesn‚Äôt feel as robust as some competitors.  
- Lack of booming bass makes it less suitable for casual music lovers.  

**Competing Products**

Pitting Yamaha‚Äôs HPH-MT5 against similar products like the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x or Sony MDR-7506 reveals interesting comparisons. The ATH-M50x, for example, edges ahead with a warmer sound signature and slightly better comfort during long wear. However, it also comes with a bulkier design that isn‚Äôt as portable. Meanwhile, Sony‚Äôs MDR-7506 offers a classic and durable option, but in my testing, its heightened treble can sometimes feel overbearing. Comparatively, Yamaha HPH-MT5 strikes a middle ground‚Äîit‚Äôs more neutral and lightweight, catering to purists and practical users alike.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

When considering these headphones with their competitors, it‚Äôs clear Yamaha HPH-MT5 offers excellent value for its price. While they aren‚Äôt the cheapest option on the market, their accurate audio reproduction, relative comfort, and portability make them a worthy investment for anyone in need of professional-grade monitoring headphones. For audiophiles, studio professionals, or even hobbyists recording podcasts or producing music at home, these headphones pack a punch without breaking the bank.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

As my annual form of torture, for the last 4ish months I have been contacting authors and indie publishers to see if they would allow me to run a massive sale for readers using their books. Some said no (nicely), some didn't answer (Come on Matt, pick up my calls! :P), and many said yes - hooray!

As a result, where Year 1 of this sale had 150 ebooks, I'm happy to report that Year 2 (this year) has 271 ebooks, 8 author interviews (search ""A LitRPG Conversation with"" on Youtube), 10 discounted and WIDE audiobooks, and one spiffy site with filtering by price and by author.

Now, this subreddit does not like external links, but for the best experience, please check out the sale page, preferably on a browser, where you can see book tropes, filter, and peruse all the pretty covers - the website is in the first few images below. (Mods, please don't smite me) Last year's post was an unruly mess, so I've opted for a text table with Tropes instead of images. **Again, for pretty cover images, filtering, and tropes, please use the actual sale page.**

I won't be able to include all the pretty promo pictures, but I would like to showcase just two to dispel any initial doubts. First, some might think that this sale is only for the smallest stories. While there are small and underrated stories that deserve your attention - we're all indie authors - the sale also includes several massive names: Exhibit A below.

Secondly, some might worry that many of the stories are ""old"". Again, while there are many classics of the genre, I can assure you that there are stories released as recently as two weeks ago - Exhibit B below.

Exhibit A:

[Titles with thousands of reviews](https://preview.redd.it/3d99xt56okkf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=8abe9ee62d00848efac39b772fb17c32bbbc5e05)

Without further ado, below you'll find a full list of all 270 discounted books, with their author provided tropes. Please check out the list, as there are tons of amazing stories, all discounted for your perusal and entertainment. **And if you're stuck, ask for a recommendation in the comments! And if you're really really stuck, or want all 270 images, the site is listed above!**

AND of course Reddit says the table is too large lol I'll be splitting it up, here are the first 100 titles!

1mx6gge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leathercraft/comments/1mx6gge/looking_for_honest_feedback_would_india_buy_a/,Looking for honest feedback ‚Äî would India buy a full grain leather desk mat that actually ages like an heirloom?,"I‚Äôve been quietly working on something for the past few months ‚Äî a project born out of my frustration with cheap, disposable desk mats. Most are synthetic, peel within a year, and just don‚Äôt age well. I wanted to create something different ‚Äî a desk mat that could last decades, improve with age, and maybe even become a family heirloom. That‚Äôs how Founder's Reserve was born.

\# What We‚Äôre Building

\- A premium desk mat made from: Full-grain chrome-tanned coffee-brown leather ‚Äî the kind that develops a beautiful patina over time.

\-Handmade finish with rounded edges ‚Äî each piece unique. 33 √ó 17 inches ‚Äî big enough for your laptop, keyboard, mouse, and notebook

\-Durable cork backing ‚Äî protects your desk and stays flat.

The goal is to start with this, then slowly add matching leather mouse pads, coasters, and catch-all trays ‚Äî all in the same Founder‚Äôs Reserve finish so your setup feels cohesive.

\#Why I‚Äôm Posting Here

Before I commit to a larger batch, I‚Äôd love to hear from people who actually care about desk setups:

\-Would you buy something like this at ‚Çπ2,999?

\- What colors or leather finishes would you prefer?

\-What would make a premium desk mat worth it for you?

Even a quick comment or upvote helps me understand if this idea has legs in India.

hey everyone, so i see a lot of posts asking about making money online in LA and i wanted to share some ideas that aren't just ""drive for uber"" or ""take surveys."" i've been doing the online hustle thing for a while here and it's definitely possible to make pretty decent money. you just have to be a little creative.  
  
1. bet you didn't think of this one: become a virtual location scout. seriously. with all the filming that happens here, production companies are always looking for specific types of houses, neighborhoods, and landscapes. you can build a portfolio of locations around your area, create a simple website or a killer instagram page, and market your services to indie filmmakers and commercial producers. it's all done online, from finding leads to sending them your portfolio. you could make a few hundred to a couple thousand per gig depending on the project.  
  
2. rent out your parking space online. not gonna lie, this is one of the easiest things i've done. i use an app called Prked to rent out my driveway. since parking in LA is a nightmare, it's a super easy way to make some extra cash. if you live near a popular spot like the beach, a stadium, or even a busy metro station, you can make good money from short-term parking. but honestly, tons of people just need monthly parking for their car, especially in neighborhoods with limited street parking, so you can do that from anywhere in Los Angeles. it's mostly passive income once you're set up.  
  
3. create hyper-local social media content. i'm not talking about being a big-time influencer. think smaller and more niche. start an instagram or tiktok account focused on something super specific to your neighborhood, like ""the best street tacos in East LA"" or ""dog-friendly hikes in the Santa Monica mountains."" once you get a following, local businesses will pay you to feature them. it's a fun way to explore the city and you can make a few hundred bucks per post.  
  
4. offer online interior design consultations for small apartments. so many people in LA live in tiny, expensive apartments and have no idea how to make them look good. if you have an eye for design, you can offer e-design services. you can do it all through zoom and email, creating mood boards and shopping lists for clients. with the high cost of traditional interior designers, this is a more affordable option that a lot of people are looking for.  
  
5. become a script reader or editor for aspiring screenwriters. this is so LA. there are thousands of aspiring writers here, and they all need feedback on their scripts. if you have a good grasp of story structure and formatting, you can offer your services on sites like fiverr or upwork, or even market yourself in local writers' groups on facebook. you can make anywhere from $50 to a few hundred per script, depending on the level of feedback you provide.  
  
6. manage airbnb experiences, virtually. a lot of people who list their homes on airbnb don't have the time to also create and manage an ""experience."" you can partner with them and do it all online. you could create a ""virtual"" experience, like an online cooking class featuring California cuisine, or you could manage the bookings and customer service for an in-person experience they host. you'd just take a cut of their earnings.  
  
7. provide local SEO services for small businesses. so many small businesses in LA have terrible online visibility. if you can learn the basics of local search engine optimization (SEO), you can help them get found on google maps and in local searches. you can start with small, local shops in your neighborhood and charge them a monthly retainer. this is a skill in high demand, and you can make some serious money once you know what you're doing.  
  
8. create and sell a ""digital nomad's guide to Los Angeles."" LA is a huge hub for remote workers and digital nomads. you could create a comprehensive guide with everything they need to know: the best coffee shops to work from in different neighborhoods, co-working spaces, visa info for international visitors, and tips on how to meet people. sell it as a pdf or an ebook on your own website or a platform like gumroad.  
  
9. offer online personal training with a ""beach body"" focus. it's LA, so health and fitness are huge. but not everyone wants to go to a crowded gym. if you're a certified personal trainer, you can offer online workout plans and virtual coaching sessions. marketing it with a California-specific vibe could really help you stand out.  
  
10. freelance your skills on upwork or fiverr. okay, this one's more obvious, but it's still a solid way to make money. whether you're a writer, graphic designer, video editor, or programmer, there's a ton of work available. the trick is to tailor your profile to the LA market. mention your local knowledge and experience to attract clients from the entertainment, tech, and creative industries that are so big here.  
  
hope this helps someone out. it's a tough city, but there are definitely ways to make it work. good luck.",1,1755869012.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False

1mx6dzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mx6dzt/could_the_mr_coffee_sk12rb_coffee_maker_review/,Could the Mr. Coffee SK12-RB Coffee Maker Review Uncover Its Brewing Potential?,"Brewing coffee has always been a big part of my daily routine, so testing out the **Mr. Coffee SK12-RB** Simple Brew 12-Cup Switch Coffee Maker was an exciting experience. This product blends straightforward functionality with the promise of simplicity, fitting perfectly into the busy lives of coffee lovers like me. During my time using this coffeemaker, it managed to nail the no-frills approach, but as with any product, there are a few quirks worth pointing out.

**Design and Build**  
Simplicity in design quickly stood out to me when I unboxed this coffee maker. It‚Äôs lightweight, measuring about 9.2 inches deep, 12.3 inches wide, and 13.6 inches tall. It doesn‚Äôt take up too much counter space, which I appreciated, especially in a kitchen already dominated by appliances. Its clean white exterior feels minimalistic, giving it a classic appearance. The dual water window is an excellent addition, letting me gauge the precise water level and avoid accidental overflows‚Äîa recurring problem with my old coffee maker! That said, while the design is functional, the plastic exterior did feel slightly flimsy.

**Highlights**  
- Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause allows quick coffee access mid-brew.  
- Easy-to-read dual water window prevents water overflow accidents.  
- Lightweight and compact for smaller kitchen spaces.

**Performance and Brewing Efficiency**  
This machine is a manual operation wonder. For a classic drip coffee maker, I couldn‚Äôt ask for much more in performance. Brewing was straightforward: add ground coffee, pour water, switch it on, and let it work its magic. The Auto Pause feature was fantastic during rushed mornings when I couldn‚Äôt wait for the entire pot to brew. It‚Äôs hard not to appreciate the attention to small, practical details that make mornings smoother.

The coffee itself? Rich, consistent, and piping hot. I used it with some medium-roast grounds, and the result felt like a caf√©-worthy cup. However, one quibble I noticed is the brewing speed‚Äîit‚Äôs not the fastest brewer out there. If you‚Äôre like me and occasionally need coffee *now*, this might test your patience.

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Whenever a coffee maker promises simple cleanup, I‚Äôm a bit skeptical. Surprisingly, this one delivered. The lift-and-clean filter basket made disposing of used coffee grounds and washing the basket a breeze. There‚Äôs no reusable filter to mess around with, and fewer parts mean fewer headaches during maintenance. However, the white finish smudges easily, and keeping it pristine required more effort.

**Key Benefits**  
- Reliable, hot coffee brewing without complicated settings.  
- Straightforward controls‚Äîideal for those who dislike overly technical coffee machines.  
- Easy maintenance with the removable filter basket.

**Weaknesses**  
Despite its highlights, the product isn‚Äôt without shortcomings:  
- The plastic exterior, while lightweight, compromises on durability.  
- Brewing speed feels slow compared to pricier alternatives.  
- The white outer shell is prone to visible stains and scuffs.  

**Alternative Products**  
While this coffee maker excels in simplicity and affordability, several competitors are vying for a spot on your countertop. The **Hamilton Beach FlexBrew** offers single-serve and full-pot brewing, catering to more diverse preferences. It‚Äôs bulkier than Mr. Coffee, but its dual brewing feature gives it an edge for those seeking flexibility. Another contender, the **Black+Decker 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker**, competes with its programmable timer and digital display‚Äîideal for anyone wanting their coffee ready the moment they wake up. However, for those who like to stick with tried-and-true simplicity, the Mr. Coffee model holds its ground.

**Price Performance**  
In terms of affordability, you‚Äôre genuinely getting solid value. It doesn‚Äôt offer the excessive flair or tech seen in high-end coffee makers, but that‚Äôs where its charm lies. For drip coffee enthusiasts who just want a good cup without too many bells and whistles, this is a smart purchase. It strikes a good balance between price and functionality, catering to users prioritizing basic, reliable brewing. You‚Äôre essentially paying for a no-nonsense coffee maker that doesn‚Äôt promise the moon yet delivers where it matters most: brewing your morning caffeine.

# Coffee Profile

* **Origin:**¬†Guatemala (Huehuetenango)
* **Processing:**¬†Washed
* **Flavor Profile:**¬†Expect a classic, comforting cup with notes of¬†**dark chocolate, nuts, and a creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel.**

# Your V60 Switch Brew Guide

For a coffee with this rich profile, we'll use a modified full immersion method on the V60 Switch, similar to what we've seen from brewing masters who prioritize a consistent, repeatable process.

# Recipe

* **Coffee:**¬†20g (medium grind)
* **Water:**¬†300g (at a temperature of¬†200‚àòF)
* **Brew Time:**¬†3:30 - 4:00 total

# Grinder Setting (1zpresso K-Ultra)

For this medium-dark, rich Guatemalan coffee, a medium grind is ideal to balance extraction. A good starting point for your 1zpresso K-Ultra would be around¬†**6.5 to 7.5 clicks**¬†from zero. This is slightly coarser than the Ethiopian coffee to prevent over-extraction of the chocolatey notes, which can turn bitter if ground too finely. Start at¬†**7.0 clicks**¬†and adjust from there.

# Steps

1. **Preparation (0:00 - 0:30):**
   * Place the V60 Switch on your scale and a mug or carafe underneath.
   * Ensure the switch is in the¬†**CLOSED**¬†position.
   * Place a filter in the dripper. Use your Hamilton Beach Variable Temp Kettle to heat the water to¬†200‚àòF.
   * Rinse the filter and preheat the dripper by pouring hot water over it. Discard the rinse water.
   * Add your 20g of coffee grounds and gently shake the dripper to level the bed.
2. **Full Immersion Steep (0:00 - 2:00):**
   * Start your timer.
   * With the switch¬†**CLOSED**, pour all 300g of water slowly over the grounds, making sure to fully saturate them.
   * Give the slurry a gentle stir for about 10 seconds to ensure a full and even saturation.
   * Put the lid on to retain heat. Let the coffee steep for a full¬†**2 minutes**.
3. **The Drawdown (2:00 - 4:00):**
   * At the¬†**2:00 minute mark**, give the brew a final gentle swirl to settle the grounds.
   * Immediately after, flip the switch to the¬†**OPEN**¬†position.
   * Let the coffee draw down into the mug. This should take about 1.5 to 2 minutes. The total brew time should be between 3:30 and 4:00.



I do give it feedback after a cup to tell it what I think of the taste and it has made the proper adjustments when I do so.  I have told it which people I follow on YouTube to learn about coffee as well as which subreddits I follow, books, etc.  I don't know that Gemini is quite 'perfect' at it yet but I am enjoying toying with it.

1mx6crq,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1mx6crq/explore_the_best_ice_cream_maker_ninja_nc300/,Explore the Best Ice Cream Maker Ninja NC300 Worth the Hype,"Testing out the Ninja NC300 has been like stepping into a dessert wonderland. This ice cream maker promises a lot, and it packs quite a punch in delivering creamy, personalized frozen treats. From the elegant silver body to the clever design, it‚Äôs made with attention to detail that truly stands out. Cooking gadgets often have a certain aesthetic to match their kitchen companions, and this one is sleek enough to claim a permanent spot on the countertop without making your kitchen look cluttered. I myself was skeptical at first, wondering if it could genuinely turn frozen blocks into luscious ice cream, sorbets, or milkshakes the way it claimed. But as someone who‚Äôs done multiple batches with it, I‚Äôm honestly impressed‚Äîand a little addicted.

**Built to Impress with Design and Functionality**  
Sturdy yet not too heavy for moving around, the build quality feels reassuringly premium. At 16 pounds, it strikes the right balance between portability and stability. This is not one of those wobbly gadgets you hesitate to whip out. Its dimensions (16""L x 8""W x 17""H) make it compact enough to fit beside your coffee maker without an issue, which is great because let‚Äôs face it, counter real estate is precious. The dual-drive motor is a hidden gem too, offering smooth performance without obnoxious noise levels.

**5 Versatile Programs Make it Easy for Everyone**  
With the options for Ice Cream, Sorbet, Milkshake, Lite Ice Cream, and the Mix-In feature, everything is ridiculously intuitive. Selecting the program is as easy as choosing from a touch panel, and the results deliver. I particularly appreciated the Lite Ice Cream option‚Äîperfect for calorie-conscious creations when you‚Äôre in the ""I want dessert but I also had fries for lunch"" mood. And the Mix-In feature? Let‚Äôs just say, both my kids and I had way too much fun tossing in crushed Oreos and gummy bears.

[Check Ninja NC300 price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b093k74nwh/)  

**Fun for All Ages and Skill Levels**  
Using the Ninja NC300 feels strangely foolproof. While some appliances come with a ""study-the-manual"" prerequisite, this one really doesn‚Äôt need it. I tested it with the family, and even my eight-year-old niece got the gist of it after one demo. If you‚Äôre watching your kids manhandle it, rest assured knowing all removable components like the outer bowl, pint containers, and paddle are dishwasher safe.

**Positives**  
- Compact design perfect for counter space  
- Multiple modes for diverse frozen treats  
- Family-friendly design ensures it's easy and fun to use  
- Dishwasher-safe components simplify cleaning  

**Flavor Creativity Meets Creamify Technology**  
This machine‚Äôs Creamerizer System makes it shine. Traditional ice cream makers often struggle to balance creaminess with efficiency, but the NC300 processes frozen blocks evenly into a silky, rich texture. I experimented with dairy-free bases and was surprised at how smooth the outcomes were. It feels like stepping into some high-end gelato shop, except the only line you‚Äôre dealing with is the one of family members waiting to snag the dessert. The Re-spin feature comes in handy too, especially if the initial texture isn‚Äôt soft enough. It gives you a second chance at perfection, which‚Ä¶let‚Äôs be real, most kitchen gadgets won‚Äôt offer.

**Drawbacks**  
- Prep work is key since bases need to be frozen solid  
- Bulkier than you'd think for storing off-counter  
- Struggles slightly with hard candy mix-ins  
- Ice cream bowls need specific containers for proper results  

**Competitive Options**  
Compared to budget alternatives like generic all-in-one ice cream makers, this is miles ahead in build quality and ease of use. On the high end, brands like Cuisinart have products packed with advanced settings. However, Ninja really nails the sweet spot by offering premium-grade technology at a more approachable price. The drawback here is you‚Äôre limited to the included pint size for recipes, while some competitors allow bigger batch sizes‚Äîwhich might matter for larger family gatherings.

**Cost Efficiency for the House Chef‚Äôs Toolkit**  
Is it worth the money? Honestly, I think so. There are cheaper units, yes, but they lack the same smoothness, speed, and long-term usability. The Ninja NC300 exceeds expectations for an appliance in this price range with its user-friendly features and consistently good results. Over time, the cost you save by making your own ""gourmet desserts"" at home versus buying fancy store-bought counterparts probably evens it out anyway. Plus, there‚Äôs something unbeatable about whipping up fresh, personalized ice creams tailored exactly to your taste.

1mx6c87,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mx6c87/should_you_trust_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_ninja/,Should you trust the best drip coffee maker Ninja DualBrew review,"Getting my hands on the Ninja CFP100 Series DualBrew Hot & Iced Coffee Maker has been a game-changer for my mornings. As a coffee enthusiast, I'm always on the hunt for reliable kitchen appliances that can cater to my evolving caffeine needs. This product, with its multi-functionality and modern design, caught my eye instantly. Promising compatibility with coffee grounds, K-Cups, and the ability to brew both hot and iced coffee, it seemed like the perfect solution for my household's diverse preferences. After weeks of testing it every day, there‚Äôs plenty to appreciate, though a couple of hiccups to address.

**Sleek and Practical Design**  
One of the first things that stood out to me was how compact yet stylish this coffee maker looks on my countertop. The black finish feels modern, blending effortlessly with my kitchen decor. Measuring at 11.03‚ÄùD x 9.9‚ÄùW x 15.22‚ÄùH, its footprint is manageable, even in smaller spaces. The foldable single-serve platform is a small, yet effective touch for minimizing splashes ‚Äì something my previous coffee machine lacked. I‚Äôm particularly impressed with the 60-ounce removable water reservoir, which makes refilling so much easier and eliminates the awkward balancing act over the sink.

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
This machine feels like having a personal barista at home. Its nine brewing sizes for grounds and four for pods mean I‚Äôve got endless flexibility. Hot coffee in the morning, iced coffee in the afternoon, and the occasional full carafe on weekends have all come out tasting superb. The three brew styles ‚Äì Classic, Rich, or Over Ice ‚Äì really allow catering to specific preferences. For me, the ‚ÄúOver Ice‚Äù option is a delight; it brews at just the right strength without leaving my iced coffee tasting watered-down.

**Strengths**  
- The dual brewing system is genuinely versatile, accommodating both grounds and pods seamlessly.  
- Adjustability is king ‚Äì from brewing sizes to warming plate timings, there‚Äôs control over everything.  
- The thermal flavor extraction tech ensures a perfectly balanced, flavorful cup, no matter the brew.  
- Cleaning has been simplified with dishwasher-safe parts and that handy clean function.  
- Keeps coffee warm for up to four hours, an absolute plus during lazy work-from-home days.

**Hurdles**  
- Despite the many settings, navigating the controls can feel like a steep learning curve initially.  
- The glass carafe is prone to drips if not poured carefully, which can make cleanup a bit annoying.  

**Convenience Features for Busy Mornings**  
My schedule swings wildly from leisurely mornings to mad dashes out the door, and this coffee maker adapts to both seamlessly. For single-serves, the Ninja Pod Adapter has been a lifesaver. Popping in a K-Cup for a quick brew takes seconds, but even the grounds brewing isn‚Äôt overly time-consuming thanks to its efficient design. The warming plate has genuinely surprised me ‚Äì setting it to keep my coffee warm for hours means no more microwaving cold leftovers. 

**Ease of Maintenance**  
There have been other coffee machines in my past, but most of them involved tedious cleaning routines that drained my patience. I love how user-friendly the maintenance is on this model. The removable pod adapter and dishwasher-safe attachments save a ton of hassle, and the dedicated cleaning function handles the rest. Even when I‚Äôve gotten lazy and spilled coffee grounds onto the machine, a quick wipe has been enough to restore it to pristine condition.

**Industry Competitors**  
Stacking up this coffee maker against other popular options, like the Keurig K-Duo and Breville Precision Brewer, has been enlightening. While the Breville is a master at brewing more precise flavors for coffee connoisseurs, it lacks the iced coffee option that the Ninja DualBrew offers. Keurig machines win on simplicity but miss out on the level of versatility this machine brings with its thermal control and vibrant coffee flavors. For families like mine, where preferences vary between pods, grounds, and iced ‚Äì these subtle differences make a big impact.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering its performance and all the added functionalities, this product delivers strong value. The versatility truthfully makes it feel like you‚Äôre getting several machines in one, which offsets its midrange price point. Some features alone, like the built-in warming plate or pod compatibility, feel like they‚Äôd belong to pricier coffee makers. While similar machines inch close on quality, they either feel overpriced or lack the sheer range of options this one offers.

1mx6c1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Educationscom/comments/1mx6c1x/studying_abroad_is_amazing_but_lets_be_real_about/,Studying abroad is amazing‚Ä¶ but let's be real about the challenges,"Studying abroad can be nerve-wracking. Let's be real, it's not all Instagram-perfect moments and vibes. It's fun, yes. But it's also hard sometimes. Here are a few things that hit me (and lots of others, too):    
  
**Homesickness:** It sneaks up on you. Even if you're super excited, missing home is totally normal. Turns out almost half of international students feel homesick at least once a week.

* What helps: Staying connected with friends and family and getting involved in clubs and groups wherever you are. The more you engage, the easier it gets.

**Making new friends**: Socializing in a new place is‚Ä¶ awkward, especially when you don't know anyone yet.

* What helps: Just start small‚Äîjoin clubs, say yes to random invites, or even ask someone for a coffee chat after class. People are more open than you think.

**Culture shock:** Everything feels different. From how people talk to how they eat, study, even cross the street. It can make you feel out of place.

* What helps: Embrace being confused! Ask questions, join local events, learn a few local phrases, and take time to observe without judging.

**Language barriers:** Even if you kind of speak the language, it can be super stressful. 68% of international students say it's a major challenge.

* What helps: Practice, ask for help, use language apps, and remind yourself it's okay not to be perfect.

**Different school systems:** Every country has its own academic expectations. You might be used to tests, but suddenly everything's group projects and essays.

* What helps: Talk to professors early, ask questions, and use academic support services (most schools have some for international students!).

**Money stress:** Living abroad gets expensive fast. Between rent, food, tuition, travel‚Ä¶ it adds up.

* What helps: Make a budget. Use student discounts. Cook at home when you can. Look for scholarships or even part-time jobs (depending on your visa!)

Studying abroad is one of the best experiences you'll ever have, but it's not effortless. And that's okay. Be patient with yourself, ask for help when you need it, and know that you're growing through every uncomfortable moment.

1mx627h,https://www.reddit.com/r/hongkongmilktea/comments/1mx627h/ultimate_guide_to_making_hong_kong_milk_tea/,Ultimate Guide to Making Hong Kong Milk Tea,"# Intro

This will be my ultimate guide on How to Make Hong Kong Milk Tea (HKMT). I won‚Äôt go into what HKMT is, because I assume you arrived here because you drank a cup from some HK cafe, tried to replicate it and failed. This guide will teach you how to make it as close as possible to what you‚Äôd get in a HK Cafe (cha chang teng). But before that, a brief intro to me.

I grew up in San Francisco in a Cantonese household. During high school was when I fell in love with HKMT, and a large part of that is attributed to a HK Cafe in the Sunset District called ABC Cafe & Bakery. Though they averaged a 2.5/5 star rating on Yelp, the go-to food review app at the time, their food at its peak was amazing, and true HK comfort food. I remember my mom and I would visit the cafe regularly after high school ended (1:30-2:30 pm) for their $5.50 afternoon tea set meals which came with a food item + a drink (+$0.50 for a cold drink). It was here that my love for HKMT was born.

I began with drinking their iced HKMT with boba. Yes not authentic. But as a high school student with a sweet tooth, the drink was really incredible. From there I transitioned to iced HKMT without boba. And then at some point, I started getting the hot HKMT (maybe it was a cold day). I fell in love with the drink and even began experimenting with making my own sometime around 2015-2016 after coming across a video on youtube teaching how to make it. Then in 2018, I made my first solo trip to HK where I went on a hunt for the best HKMT. Now this might sound crazy, but after trying around a dozen cups of HKMT in HK, I really didn‚Äôt find one that stood out. This is not to say there is no good HKMT there. It‚Äôs more like they are all so good, and taste so similar that nothing stood out as ‚Äúthe best.‚Äù I guess it‚Äôs like your first love, it leaves a lasting impression that you will always cherish.

# Equipment

First let‚Äôs go over what you need in order to start making HKMT. There are four main pieces of equipment which are a must for this recipe.

* [Teapot](https://www.kamcha.com.hk/en/shop/tea-leaves-equipment/equipment/teapot/) \- The basic vessel to hold your tea. My recipe calls for 1.2L. If you want to make a double batch, you would need minimum 2.4 L. You should aim for something with a minimum of 1.5L or 3.0L depending on if you want to make a single or double batch. A single batch yields about 6 cups of HKMT.
* [Pitcher](https://www.kamcha.com.hk/en/shop/tea-leaves-equipment/equipment/pitcher/) \- The pitcher is used to pull the tea during the brewing process
* [Ring](https://www.kamcha.com.hk/en/shop/tea-leaves-equipment/equipment/ring/) & [Tea Bag](https://www.kamcha.com.hk/en/shop/tea-leaves-equipment/equipment/tea-bag/) \- The ring and tea bag are used to hold the tea leaves during the brewing process. Some places sell this together.

I assume you will have a stove of some sort as well for brewing.

Note: You can make it in smaller batches, but the ratios will change, and I don‚Äôt have experience with making smaller batches, so won‚Äôt speak much on them.

Recommendations

* Teapot (Percolator) - [8 cup Farberware](https://www.amazon.com/Farberware-Classic-Stainless-Yosemite-Percolator/dp/B00005NCWQ/ref=sr_1_8?crid=1DWITLKKVR3E0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.OOdb2IKrk5vfRsNS4WraZw8xH6N8VGwCt_EAc9iTsXsg_752Btv38q1o-RR6plargXB-pE-7x_La-waZQzi7uXZywJeSP5YMfybNkRjOCR0s0Uou1QhCyJNkH4qDvCM7AZMzqmpX-yQBiizhHxlKhnjEjD4R7IargannjFKq_ZOnGJFGdbeuTG6crGGtGhqJBCPL3HqoNa3xOXFBAOWvnBPLJ4nQneMUV3IJYhxixsfWTsmo_BiM8G3dp32_Y8CuZP5cLwFnrZuypkXzkt5hHHrBYmysI3hG8_i-Xujl2bI.7G1VtFCtAFn-obxRk6PMkg4-yAmfCyT6iOL0UcAVmao&dib_tag=se&keywords=percolator&qid=1717553775&sprefix=percolatp%2Caps%2C388&sr=8-8&th=1) \- I have both the 8 cup and 12 cup version. I use the 8 cup version for a single batch, and the 12 cup version for a double batch. This is not as authentic as the ones they use in HK, but it was the best I could find in the US at the time and didn‚Äôt break the bank.
* [Pitcher](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08ML5VN95/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) \- This is the exact thing I bought. You can certainly use anything similar to this.
* [Ring and Tea Bag](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QMFQT54/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) \- This is one of the products I use. Get one that matches the circumference and depth as your teapot as close as you can.

# Ingredients

There are only 3 ingredients when it comes to making HKMT: tea, evaporated milk, and sugar. While the list itself is simple, the ingredients are crucial to making a good cup of HKMT. I don‚Äôt mean to be a gatekeeper in how YOU should enjoy your HKMT.. but every ingredient matters, and choosing the right type or brand makes a massive difference. If you ask me what makes a cup of HKMT it‚Äôs a strong black tea paired with evaporated milk and sugar. But since there are thousands of varieties of tea, your results are going to vary drastically from tea to tea. In the end, if you want to make a cup similar to what you‚Äôd get in HK, you need the right ingredients. Just a quick word on each ingredient, then below, I will list specific brands.

* Tea - This is the most crucial element and cannot be overlooked. I often see recipes call for ‚ÄúCeylon tea‚Äù or X tea and this is doing such a huge disservice to HKMT lovers because you‚Äôll unlikely make a good HKMT using completely random ingredients.
* Evaporated Milk - It‚Äôs evaporated milk. Get it right. It‚Äôs not condensed milk. You can add condensed milk as a sweetener, but let‚Äôs get the basics down and start with simply evaporated milk. Brand matters here.
* Sugar - plain ole granulated white sugar. Add to taste. I don‚Äôt suggest using an alternative, at least not initially, because it could change the taste.

# Specific Ingredients

Here I‚Äôll list very specific ingredients that I believe will lead you to the most authentic cup of hkmt you will make at home.

Tea blends (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)

1. HK brew tea [https://www.homebrewteahk.com/](https://www.homebrewteahk.com/) \- Yan, the owner, is great and has some content on youtube. I took their online course and bought each of their 3 or 4 blends of tea. I enjoyed them all. They have differences, but they all pass the HKMT test in my book. They ship around the world.
2. Kam Cha - [https://www.k-smart.ca/collections/black-tea](https://www.k-smart.ca/collections/black-tea) \- This site is based in Canada, but they shipped to California. I bought a few of their blends (I believe the Kam Cha Premium Blend and #1 Dai Pai Dong Blend. They both pass the HKMT test in my book.

If you ask which one I prefer? Honestly I would go by whichever one is cheaper, or easier to ship (Kamcha/Ksmart). But if you are closer to HK, you can go for that HomeBrewTeaHK.

Tea leaves - I don‚Äôt recommend you making your own blends, but if you want to try for whatever reason, here are a few products I personally used with some success. Note I will link some amazon products here, but you might find them at your local asian grocery store for cheaper.

1. Lipton from [HK](https://www.pns.hk/en/yellow-label-pkt/p/BP_100790) \- I‚Äôve only ever seen this sold in Hong Kong. If you can get your hands on this, I would suggest to base your recipe around this.
2. Rickshaw from [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Rickshaw-Black-Tea-450-Grams/dp/B004WB7G46/ref=sr_1_1?crid=O2NCTV1XZFTC&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4YBAaBjE0WsvwETcZ1SpY4tWdrHdTJI7OsqtWpf3YRZ4WPao3n-q1SOJe9IKotKvBMDWG_uAFWM18jTBkG2D7HC8HTjKr3vVMxzLcKsBTJ9l6PZ6eqihHYUjW3sRFOoh6CEgt25BNtLcOFhouHglM0JxtDHkcwej9-_cNXSH5pcXvLPXNW_Z-J9OLWRjqtWlIRgJgq4mnBpDsCH8B2FO-mHyzrG8ewP45jn7c1RX86SF75XPeG2ll5bQ3I1oqS_NwfAsJeUjT6qWk_aAZW-allulIl1pxfick6_U7NgsaqY.1jIUdcwAsCVlhF4JDgMxPcqXw_vzQsYA97FSwPqbpqE&dib_tag=se&keywords=rickshaw+tea&qid=1717556777&s=home-garden&sprefix=rickshaw+%2Cgarden%2C392&sr=1-1)

* 15g Rickshaw
* 10g Alzahwah

Do feel free to adjust and play around with the ratios. I do think Lipton/Rickshaw should comprise of at least 80% of your tea blend, but that is just anecdotal data from me.

Evaporated milk

1. Black and White (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) - I‚Äôve used their [normal one](https://www.amazon.com/Black-White-Evaporated-Filled-12fl-oz/dp/B07WHLTQQ3/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3QGE6K0RNR4AC&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.jydORgM6DRKIKTgi2NpBVfmCetcOZY_ykrnJuwlybW6BlC71a47njW_-KXTlGG9Xh0cuYj_X0ru372Bklg0Kc1_86HtMDqwiwNZ3LUwsmlohreuz3WhjS6h12-pX1Znz3Awi4XgbBD7XEHSoyg3_iDSgSD8MCmJ8Ps9DyUztJTIv5B8eYBNpxG1oCQeEnRNIrPZE9Kq9lOV2afsg3gmzVUefdYUaUBM-4gT_QSyfiwfMFS8kEZ6wuvJGOxRrL456FwzceqZmjRVhWk_o4v4vL97GHYYJcST13PR_Gq4Sitk.g8HvS6avpQ1fmNVuQkapvM4srlkryDY-1XIAF5CuMms&dib_tag=se&keywords=black+%26+white+evaporated+milk&qid=1755866435&sprefix=Black+%26+White+evaporated%2Caps%2C455&sr=8-5) as well as their [premium one](https://www.amazon.com/Black-White-Extra-Creamy-Evaporated/dp/B07P8KPMPD). From memory the normal (cheaper one) has a bunch of additives while the premium one is more natural. The cheaper one tastes better to me.
2. Avoid Carnation brand. The taste is significantly more bland.
3. I haven‚Äôt tried other brands, and speak on them

Sugar - no specific recommendation but I use C and W

# Explanation of tea types and ratios

To make your own blend of tea, you should familiarize yourself with some of the terminology used. This part of more advanced, even for me. But I‚Äôll just include a simple guide for completion purposes.

* Dust (Fine)- The main purpose of tea dust is to bring out the flavor
* BOPF (Medium)- The main purpose of BOPF (Broken Orange Pekoe Fannings) is to adjust the smoothness
* BOP (Coarse)- The main purpose of BOP (Broken Orange Pekoe) is to adjust the color and fragrance

This is the secret sauce when it comes to HKMT. Every shop and every HKMT master has their own formula and ratios. Use the guidelines above to adjust to your liking. I‚Äôll give you an idea for a starting point where you can then adjust to your standards: 60% Fine, 30% Medium, 10% Coarse.

# The Process

Storytime. First I want to explain that I‚Äôm a regular guy that has a passion for food. Whenever I learn a new dish, I spend hours watching YouTube videos and reading books/blogs, and really pour my heart into making it the best way possible. I don‚Äôt skimp on time nor quality of ingredients. My journey with homemade HKMT began roughly 10 years ago. I watched a YouTube video of a random guy making it, and I loosely copied what he did. It tasted alright, but was far from CCT standard. From there I was on and off on making HKMT at home. It wasn‚Äôt until 2019 where I really started getting more serious. I was traveling to Guangzhou, and randomly stumbled across a shop displaying trophies (shop name: **È¶ôÊ∏ØÈ∏≥È∏ØÁéã,** multiple locations in Guangzhou\*\*)\*\*. I was intrigued, and even more so when I walked closer and realized they were selling HKMT. I knew I had to try. It turns out that the owner won the HKMT championship in 2015 for their yuanyang (HKMT + coffee) part of the competition. I will say their yuanyang was the best I‚Äôve ever had. It might be my #1 favorite drink in the world, and I think I like it more than the best HKMT I‚Äôve had. I can attest that their HKMT is solid. Anyway, after falling in love with their drink, I noticed a 99 rmb version. I was intrigued and asked the store manager about it. She mentioned it was the owner‚Äôs championship formula, and must be preordered, and the owner will personally demonstrate the entire process. I was sold and make the purchase. A week or so later, I sat down with the master and watched him make his champion yuanyang. So I learned the entire process, but not the exact formula. My process today is a very close copy of his method. With that as my base, I returned home in 2020 due to covid, and all my local shops with the best HKMT didn‚Äôt make it right anymore. My guess is that their tea supply was cut off because of that Evergreen shipping incident. So that just further pushed me to learn to make my own HKMT.

The actual process

Ingredients:

* 60g tea blend
* 1200g water
* 1 can evaporated milk (354g)

If making a double batch:

* 120g tea blend
* 2300g water
* 2 cans evaporated milk
* Note: The reason there is less water in this is because you have less evaporation as a result of increasing the batch size.

Note: The main reason I use these ratios is because are based on the size of a can of evaporated milk (354g). I have no other use for evaporated milk, so instead of storing it in my fridge, I just make a batch using exactly 1 can of evaporated milk.

Steps

1. Bring water to a boil
2. Pour tea blend into tea bag
3. When water is boiling, do two tea pulls\*. The first pull will be into the empty pitcher. The second pull will be back into the tea pot.
4. Brew the tea on medium-high heat for 10 minutes. The idea here is to extract as much out of the tea in a short time. You want a medium-high heat so the water is moving inside the pot with enough force to get some good mixing going on (i don‚Äôt know if this actually happens)
5. Turn the heat to low, then proceed with 4 pulls. At this point, the tea leaves should have clumped up inside the tea bag. The idea here is to loosen the leaves a bit to encourage more extraction in the next phase. The tea-water should be back in the tea pot after 4 pulls. You don‚Äôt need to pull too high because that can cause the temperature to drop too much.
6. Brew on low heat for 15 minutes. At this stage we are continuing to extract the flavors from the tea, but we don‚Äôt want to boil excessively or we will lose too much liquid.
7. Prepare a warm cup and fill up 1/4 of the cup with evaporated milk.
8. Fill the rest of the cup with tea
9. Add sugar to taste

\*Note: A tea pull is when you pour the tea-water from one container through the tea bag into another container. Sample video [here](https://youtu.be/wW3IxfFXfoQ?t=187).

# Variations

A note on ratios

A great cup of hkmt contains evaporated milk and tea. The general recommendation is you want somewhere between 25-33% evaporated milk, with 25% being the more common recommendation: 2oz of evaporated milk and 6oz of tea. It boils down to personal taste, so feel free to adjust to your own taste.

For my method, I usually make it in a large batch, so I start with 1 can of evaporated milk (354g) and I squeeze as much tea out of my tea bag (which is usually around 900g). 354/1254 is roughly 28.2% so if you need a number go with that. Then I add roughly 50g of sugar (4%) and that is my final product. Per cup, this turns out to be:

* 150g tea
* 60g evaporated milk
* 8g sugar

Milk or tea first into the cup? I go with milk first, and I would estimate that is the standard. In general, this way the milk is more smooth (you slowly raise the temperature of the milk and tempur it), whereas if you pour cold milk into a large portion of tea, the milk has a chance to curdle.",1,1755868108.0,hongkongmilktea,0,1.0,False

I ground up a bit of old stale coffee to see how fine the grounds where. When I felt like they had about the same grind size I normally use I went for it. 20g in, 40g out, in about 30s!! So lucky!

The result? Pure bliss! I don't even know If I need to adjust anything. Great balance, a punchy acidity that's not overwhelming and incredible body with a delicious syrupy consistency. Best of all? There was so much depth in flavor! I think this is ""clarity"", I could taste ""flavours"" instead or just sour/bitter. I have very little tasting experience, but now I might actually be able to develop it with different coffee's! 

The Opus made espresso, way better than most if not all cafe's I've ever been to, but this is just on a whole new level. It's almost like going from a store bought preground to freshly ground specialty coffee. Preground taste like ""coffee"", but there's no depth. The Opus made ""espresso"" with varying acidity and bitterness, but the DF64 incorporated ""flavours"" if you know what I'm rambling about. I'm so happy!",3,1755868011.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

for years I tried on off to stay away from coffee (for me coffee is the issue, less caffeine itself, so I will talk about coffee here). A couple weeks ago I was at the hospital for high blood pressure (several factors that day that led to my pulse not lowering after 4 hours+), after that I decided to give it a rest. Worked for like 10 days, then for some reason (actually as a motivator) I startet with 1 cappuccino before my first workout. This was supposed to stop after a couple times (like 3) to the gym when that habit got build up again. Couple days on and off with like 2-3 days without consumption in between. *Of course* this wasn't sustainable and kind of escalated so that I am back now to sometimes two, sometimes 6 units of espresso (like 1 unit = 1 small cappuccino, 2 units of espresso in a flat white). I count in these units for my own documentation of my consumption (kind of a diary to have an overview of my consumption patterns). 

Fyi, In the last months I was able to cut down substantially, like in half. I am suprised that there were days at all where I had only 1 or 2 units.

In this life, I stopped all kinds of drugs, alcohol and cigarettes, for good. Stopped other unhealthy habits, began healthy habits (like no sugar, but yes sports/sleep etc.). So whats up with my coffee intake? I have this feeling coffee gives me something I can't resist (or WON'T), mentally or biologically (ADHD here). But other drugs did that aswell for a while, and still I was able to quit them eventually.

So my question & the **tl;dr:** people that were on and off with coffee, what made you finally stop for good? Some epiphany, some life changing event, some biological reason like heart attacks/strokes, what did it for you? 

Very much appreciated. ",3,1755867956.0,decaf,3,1.0,False
1mx5zu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1mx5zu0/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

The pumpkin swirl tasted dishwatery...which I think other pumpkin flavored things also do....but it did grow on me, and by the end of the drink I was enjoying it.

The hazelnut flavor did more to boost the pumpkin than anything.

1mx5vzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleMentality/comments/1mx5vzk/top_10_small_business_ideas_in_phoenix_az_to/,"Top 10 small business ideas in Phoenix, AZ to start this year","  
  
what's up everyone. so you're thinking about starting a business in phoenix, huh? good call. this city is blowing up right now and there's a ton of opportunity if you know where to look. i've been in the game here for a while, started a few things, seen what works and what doesn't. so i figured i'd throw together a list of ideas for anyone looking to do their own thing. and i'm not gonna give you the same old boring list you've seen a million times. let's get into some real, non-obvious stuff.  
  
1. mobile bar service. bet you didn't think of this one. everyone and their dog is getting married or having some kind of event outdoors here, especially in the cooler months. instead of a boring old table with a bartender, you roll up with a cool, converted horse trailer or vintage camper and serve drinks out of that. it's an experience, and people will pay for it. startup costs can be anywhere from like $5,000 to $20,000 depending on how fancy you get with the trailer. you'll need to look into arizona's liquor laws, but a lot of these businesses operate as ""dry hire,"" meaning the client buys the booze and you just provide the service.  
  
2. Prked parking space rental. honestly, this is a pretty solid opportunity for some passive income. if you've got an extra parking spot, especially a covered one, you can rent it out on Prked. think about it, not everyone has a garage or covered parking, and in phoenix, that's a huge deal with the sun and heat. you can rent out your driveway, garage, or even a spot in your yard. for short-term parking, think about being near downtown phoenix, scottsdale, or tempe for events. but there's also a big market for monthly parking anywhere in the city since so many people need a regular place to park their car. you could make a few hundred bucks a month pretty easily. check out prked's site, they say you can earn between $144-$324 a month in Phoenix.  
  
3. short-term rental management. so many people own airbnbs and vrbo's in the phoenix area but don't want to deal with the day-to-day headaches. that's where you come in. you handle the bookings, cleaning, guest communication, all of it. the startup costs are pretty low since you're not buying the properties. you're just providing a service. you'll need to be organized and good with people. the city of phoenix does have some regulations for short-term rentals, so you'll need to be up on those. you can charge a percentage of the rental income, usually somewhere between 15% and 25%.  
  
4. mobile auto detailing. this one isn't totally unheard of, but it's a great business for phoenix. everyone's cars are constantly getting dusty and sun-baked. and people here have nice cars and want to keep them looking good. the mobile part is key because it's so convenient for people. you can get started for a few thousand dollars with some basic equipment. and if you focus on ceramic coatings and other paint protection services, you can charge a premium.  
  
5. specialty food truck. i know, i know, food trucks aren't a new idea. but hear me out. phoenix's food scene is getting more and more diverse. if you can find a unique niche, you can do really well. don't just do another taco truck. think about something like gourmet grilled cheese, specialty coffee, or a vegan food truck. the startup costs are a bit higher for this one, probably in the $50,000 to $100,000 range to get a decent truck and equipment. and you'll need to get all the right permits from maricopa county.  
  
6. pool cleaning and maintenance. ok, this one's a little more obvious, but it's a no-brainer in phoenix. almost everyone has a pool, and nobody wants to clean it themselves, especially in the summer. it's a recurring revenue business, which is awesome. you can start with a few clients and grow from there. startup costs are relatively low, you'll need a truck and some equipment, probably around $5,000 to $10,000 to get going.  
  
7. smart home installation. phoenix is a big city for new home construction, and a lot of people are into home automation now. if you're tech-savvy, you can start a business installing smart thermostats, security cameras, lighting, and all that. it's a growing market, and not a lot of people are specializing in it yet.  
  
8. desert-friendly landscaping. everyone in phoenix is tired of high water bills. so a landscaping business that specializes in xeriscaping and using native, drought-tolerant plants is a great idea. you'll be helping people save money and water, which is a big selling point here.  
  
9. event and wedding planning. with all the people moving to phoenix, the event and wedding industry is booming. if you're organized and creative, you can start a business helping people plan their perfect day. you can specialize in a certain type of event, like corporate events or more intimate weddings.  
  
10. online marketing for local businesses. so many small businesses in phoenix are great at what they do, but they're terrible at marketing themselves online. if you know your way around social media, seo, and online advertising, you can start a business helping other businesses grow. the best part is that you can do it all from home with very low overhead.  
  
so there you have it. a few ideas to get you started. honestly, the best business to start is the one you're actually passionate about. so think about what you're good at and what you enjoy, and then go for it. phoenix is a great place to be an entrepreneur right now. hope this helps someone out.",1,1755867674.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False

And here‚Äôs the catch: these costs are just the bare minimum to comply with regulations. 

They don‚Äôt guarantee the data is actually safe. 

A small company with no real background in handling sensitive information could be spending tens of thousands per year and still risk having your data breached.

Think of it this way: you expect your barista to make you a good coffee, not to build the espresso machine from scratch. 
In the same way, you shouldn‚Äôt expect a small trading app, NFT marketplace, or startup exchange to also be experts at running secure servers, encrypting databases, and keeping hackers out. 

But regulations force them to try anyway.


Handling this data is not cheap, at all and these costs can balloon very quickly.

Here‚Äôs how the numbers look in Europe:

üìÇ In-house KYC & AML monitoring 
(company runs its own system)

Setup can cost ‚Ç¨50k ‚Äì ‚Ç¨250k for secure servers, audits, compliance.

Yearly costs range from:
‚Ä¢ 1k users: ‚Ç¨32k ‚Äì ‚Ç¨37k/year
‚Ä¢ 10k users: ‚Ç¨170k ‚Äì ‚Ç¨190k/year
‚Ä¢ 100k users: ‚Ç¨1.35M ‚Äì ‚Ç¨1.4M/year


This is why some companies decide to outsource this service and actually pay third parties to handle their data.

Here‚Äôs what that looks like:

‚òÅÔ∏è Outsourced KYC providers

Identity check: about ‚Ç¨1 ‚Äì ‚Ç¨5 per verification.

Continuous AML monitoring: ‚Ç¨0.32 per user per month.

That means a platform with 10k users spends roughly ‚Ç¨68k/year just to outsource KYC & monitoring.


üöÄ This is why we built Verifyo.
Instead of every platform re-collecting and re-storing your documents, you do KYC once. 

Your data is stored securely, off-chain, never shared again. 

Platforms get a zero-knowledge ‚Äúbadge‚Äù proving you‚Äôre compliant, without ever seeing your personal data. 

For users: free, privacy-first, no more handing your passport around.

For companies: free, fully compliant, no storage risk, no huge yearly bills.


So the next time you‚Äôre asked for KYC, remember: storing that data is expensive, complicated, and risky for companies that shouldn‚Äôt even be in the business of storing sensitive data. 

With Verifyo, they (and you) get the same compliance for zero costs.",6,1755867503.0,Verifyo,0,1.0,False

1mx5rcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1mx5rcz/void_brain_fog_and_dizziness_my_symptoms_of/,"Void, brain fog and dizziness. My symptoms of mental illness for over 20 years.","So, I'm currently on alcohol and coffee abstinence to try and address my mental health problems that I've been battling, probably my whole life. 
Writing this now in despair, and because writing seems to be the only medicine that seems to counteract the feeling of complete void in parts of my head. 

My family problems and development in early years was probably the first issue which I need to talk with professionals about and have done, When I could afford it. But the event which changed everything was when I was 22 (20 years ago) was having an amphetamine overdose of sorts, spiked in ways by a friend who then subsequently had an altercation with, Being punched in the eye. 

This night seemed to fracture something in my brain and I never had the same sensation I did before. 

I had real issues for a long time after that in all aspects of my life. And never felt like the same person.  I was young and energetic still but never as strong as before.  Never felt pleasure for simple things as strongly. And had very uncomfortable relationships, work struggles were even worse. I quicky lost hope and was crazy at times. If I drank, a lot, then I could almost recreate the feelings of pleasure, think dopamine serotonin flooding my mind, a sort of drug fuelled escape from the adhedonic state I would be in day to day during the week. 

This went on for years and I felt it had probably been coming for years before (this overdose event).  I have been up and down for a long time, treating myself either with medication, addictions, or abstinence and trying desperately to repair.  

I had got to a balanced state again but was still drinking and experimenting with drugs once more. 

I went then and did Ayahuasca. Not advisable I should have known, but hindsight is a wonderful thing. And I really did it. It blew my brains out and since that my life has been... I can't quite tell you the details of what that brought up. Just now. My mind feels like it's imploding. Grey matter receding, devasting energy loss. It stripped my body of vigor, and stamina.  Like chemotherapy of sorts. I now have to not drink. Not smoke etc. but at times I have. Either way I'm in a endless battle. I just don't know what to do or not to do anymore. Its just better to stay healthy and keep afloat I think. Like there's a journey to recovery. And I can't keep starting again or I won't have time to get to the destination. Then again, I'm not sure there is a destination . 

There's mountains of other stuff from life I have to process still and it's overwhelming but that's what will keep me alive.  Everyone has their walls to climb. Avoidance is probably the cause of us losing our faculties. So I appreciate the pain it causes me somehow, (to have to deal with life) it's complications and disappointments.  

I hate that I hurt or annoy people I love though. And can't find the thing I need in life to survive on my own. 

I can't expect to find anything I haven't already tried here. But I've never done anything like this. 
And I could share my insights or remedies that have helped if anyone is starting something similar. 

We find ourselves in the service of others after all,  Some nice Indian man said once I think. 

So. There you go.

1mx5p7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1mx5p7m/discover_why_waterdrop_wdg2mro_filter_review/,Discover Why Waterdrop WD-G2MRO Filter Review Proves It's a Game-Changer for Clean Water!,"The **Waterdrop WD-G2MRO Reverse Osmosis Filter**, designed as a replacement filter for compatible reverse osmosis systems such as the WD-G2-B, WD-G2-W, and WD-G2MNR-W, has been a part of my daily kitchen routine for some weeks now. I decided to test it not only as a household user but also as someone who frequently reviews appliance-related products. Its promise of reducing impurities and providing high-quality water caught my attention, and I have to say, this filter delivers big time‚Äîthough not without a few things to consider.

**Design and Installation**  
Right out of the box, the slim, cylindrical shape and professional-grade build impressed me. At just 6.3 inches in diameter and standing 16.73 inches tall, it integrates neatly under the sink. The installation process was, honestly, a breeze. I was skeptical about the ‚Äúreplace the filter in 3 seconds with a twist‚Äù claim, but it was no exaggeration. You don‚Äôt need tools, which made me appreciate how user-friendly the design truly is. Even someone like my neighbor, who avoids anything DIY, could replace this filter without any hiccups.

[Check Waterdrop WD-G2MRO price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0chxqs395/)

**Performance and Effectiveness**  
The real test of any water filtration system is, of course, what comes out of the tap. This filter employs a reverse osmosis membrane with remarkable precision, filtering up to 0.0001 microns. I‚Äôve tested this with water containing high TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) levels, and the reduction was noticeable after flushing. Heavy metals like lead and arsenic, which are often nightmares in traditional filtration setups, were also significantly reduced. Though I‚Äôm no scientist, I can confidently say the taste of the water improved dramatically‚Äîno odors, no ‚Äúearthy‚Äù tones that you typically experience with substandard filters.

**Durability and Longevity**  
This filter claims to last for up to 24 months or roughly 2,200 gallons of water, depending on your usage. That‚Äôs a bold claim, but given my experience over weeks of heavy use, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs on track. I drink lots of water daily, and I‚Äôve even tested the output by cooking soups and coffee. Everything tastes cleaner, lighter, and yes, worth the investment. However, keep in mind that this longevity may vary depending on the water quality in your area.

**Key Benefits**  
- Twist-and-replace design eliminates the need for tools.  
- Superior filtration ensures clean water by reducing heavy metals, PFAS, and more.  
- Long lifespan minimizes the need for frequent replacements.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
I wouldn‚Äôt be doing this review justice if I didn‚Äôt nitpick a little.  
- The replacement filter doesn‚Äôt come with extra parts or indicators for remaining filter life. Some competitors include such features for ease of use.  
- Like most advanced filtration systems, initial flushing water wastage could be off-putting, especially if you‚Äôre eco-conscious.

**Competitors**  
The primary contenders for this replacement filter are from brands like APEC, iSpring, and Brondell. Comparing Waterdrop‚Äôs offering to some alternatives, I found its installation and maintenance to be far easier. APEC units typically demand more effort to set up, and while iSpring‚Äôs models offer stellar filtration as well, they often come at a steeper price. Brondell filters may match the taste quality but are less effective at reducing heavy metals and TDS. I believe this filter strikes the balance between convenience, performance, and cost.

**Cost Efficiency**  
This replacement filter leans toward the higher price range of its category, but it offers more than just decent performance. Considering the savings from prolonged usability and the noticeably better water taste, I believe it fits the ‚Äúyou get what you pay for‚Äù mold. It‚Äôs worth investing in if you prioritize pure water over everything else. But if you‚Äôre pinching pennies or live in an area with already-good water quality, it may feel like an unnecessary splurge.

1mx5p4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleMentality/comments/1mx5p4x/top_10_ways_to_make_money_online_from_chicago_il/,"Top 10 ways to make money online from Chicago, IL","  
  
hey everyone, just wanted to share some ideas for making money online from right here in chicago. the cost of living isn't getting any cheaper, so a little extra income from the internet can make a huge difference. i've tried a few things and have seen what works.  
  
1. bet you didn't think of this one, but online language tutoring is a real opportunity here. chicago has huge polish and spanish speaking communities, not to mention mandarin chinese and other languages. if you're fluent, you can create an online course or do one-on-one tutoring for people who want to learn. pretty decent money in this.  
  
2. another thing is creating a super local chicago-themed online store. i'm not just talking about generic city skyline stuff. think more niche, like designing t-shirts with inside jokes about the l train or selling prints from local logan square artists. you can use shopify and print-on-demand so you don't have to hold any inventory.  
  
3. honestly one of the easiest semi-passive things i've seen is renting out your parking spot with an app called prked. if you have a garage in wrigleyville or lakeview you could make serious cash online just by renting it out for cubs games. but it's not just for events. tons of people in chicago need monthly parking, especially in neighborhoods with permit parking. if you have an extra spot in your driveway or a garage that's just sitting there, you can list it for monthly parking and just collect the income. you manage it all online, so it's super low effort.  
  
4. create paid digital neighborhood guides. people are always looking for unique things to do. you could sell pdf guides or create a paid newsletter for stuff like ""the best vintage stores in wicker park"" or ""a foodie's guide to pilsen."" you're selling your local knowledge to tourists and even other locals online.  
  
5. freelance writing for chicago's tech scene. our city has a fast-growing tech industry. these companies need blog posts, website copy, and marketing emails. if you can write well, you can market yourself online as a writer who specializes in the chicago tech or finance industry.  
  
6. social media management for local restaurants. every restaurant, bar, and coffee shop needs an instagram presence but most owners don't have the time. you can run their social accounts from your couch. offer to do it for a monthly fee for a few spots in your neighborhood and you've got a solid online side hustle.  
  
7. selling handmade goods. chicago has a huge arts and crafts scene. if you make jewelry, candles, or any kind of art, you can set up an etsy shop or your own website to sell it. you're not limited to local craft fairs, you can sell to anyone in the world online.  
  
8. transcription services. this one isn't glamorous but it's steady work. with so many businesses, universities, and medical centers in chicago, there's a need for audio to be transcribed. you can find these gigs on freelance websites and do them from anywhere with a good internet connection.  
  
9. virtual assistant. a lot of small business owners and entrepreneurs in chicago need help with scheduling, answering emails, and other admin tasks. you can offer your services online as a virtual assistant. it's flexible work you can do from home.

1mx5o0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MindfulLoveJourney/comments/1mx5o0p/how_to_respond_when_an_ex_reaches_out/,How to Respond when an Ex Reaches Out,"Exes have an uncanny way of coming back into your life right after you get over them. If you just got a random text, DM, or phone call from your ex, you might be feeling a little confused (or even nervous). Fortunately, by figuring out what you want, you can come up with a plan to respond while keeping your cool. Read through this article for everything you need to know before responding to your ex.

  
**1. Pause before you respond.**

https://preview.redd.it/zpypubdrdkkf1.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1205c07e90b9adc39161d354b10bb4ab3c81c0f9

**Taking a pause lets you¬†calm down¬†and evaluate your emotions.**

¬†When you get a random text from your ex, it can bring up a lot of emotions. Replying to a text or a call too quickly can be a bad thing‚Äîif you haven‚Äôt thought things through yet, you might end up saying something that you regret. Always give yourself time (an hour is good) to pause when an ex reaches out.

* Plus, replying too quickly can make it seem like you were sitting by the phone waiting for them to reach out.

**2. Figure out how you feel.**

https://preview.redd.it/tkakb5wwdkkf1.jpg?width=718&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e409991f10dd1fc0af896ec4950d9b36bf429b5

**Know what you want out of the conversation before you reply.**¬†

Do you still have feelings for your ex? Do you want to get back together with them? How do you envision this conversation going?¬†Be honest¬†with yourself, and have a goal in mind before you reply.

* Try to think about how your ex might be feeling, too. For instance, if you two just broke up a few weeks ago and your ex hasn‚Äôt moved on yet, they might want to get back together. But, if it‚Äôs been months and your ex is in a new relationship, they might just be feeling nostalgic.

**3. Be casual and polite to keep things friendly.**

https://preview.redd.it/qpyd6y97fkkf1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12d16717ce7c33946405b5796312b78fc669a9e7

**Treating them like a friend helps keep things civil between you two.**¬†

Try not to immediately dive into questions or beg them to get back together with you. Instead, reply to their message like you would anyone else. This can help foster a casual relationship with your ex, which is great if you want to be¬†friends¬†with them.

* ‚ÄúHey! I‚Äôm so glad you reached out. I wanted to ask you for some advice.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI was just going to message you! How have you been?‚Äù
* You can be polite and stay in contact with your ex while still making it clear that you're not interested.

**4. Ask them why they reached out if you‚Äôre confused.**

https://preview.redd.it/8czi1u8vfkkf1.jpg?width=716&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=796bb478247ad88256b7804a48de315bd28045d6

  
**If you aren‚Äôt sure, asking why is the only way to know.**¬†

Maybe they just sent a cryptic ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù or they‚Äôre messaging you about things you did together in the past. Ask them why, exactly, they‚Äôre reaching out to you now, and what they‚Äôd like to get out of the interaction.

* ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to hear from you. Can I ask why you reached out?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHow come you decided to text me now? It‚Äôs been so long since we last talked.‚Äù

**5. Hear them out if they want closure.**

https://preview.redd.it/qsul0d14gkkf1.jpg?width=716&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86175422a2092b29cd76b28b6c21e05fee83e839

**Your ex might be reaching out to apologize or clarify things.**¬†

If that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs up to you whether or not you want to chat with them about the history of your relationship. If your relationship was a toxic one or you‚Äôre not ready to forgive them yet, feel free to ignore their message. But, if you think you might benefit from chatting with your ex about what happened, feel free to listen to what they have to say.

* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested to hear what you think about our breakup. Maybe it will give us both some closure.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm open to chatting with you, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve forgiven you yet. The breakup was really hard for me.‚Äù

**6. Try not to lead them on if you're not interested.**

https://preview.redd.it/alup62cdgkkf1.jpg?width=715&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d129cc98c38b0b06eba56bf103906645252ae9de

**Maybe your ex wants to get back together, but you don‚Äôt.**

¬†If that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs best not to respond to their messages at all. Keeping in contact with someone who still has feelings for you can really hurt them, and it won‚Äôt make you feel very good, either.

* This is especially true if you have another partner. You don‚Äôt want to give your ex hope and hurt your new significant other in the process.

**7. Ignore them if you aren‚Äôt ready to talk.**

https://preview.redd.it/dhnijchlgkkf1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c36532201d7b1a7efdf6b1db4e4c6f206ab8e56

**You‚Äôre under no obligation to respond to your ex.**¬†

If you‚Äôre still¬†recovering¬†from the breakup or you don‚Äôt want to get involved with them again, read their message and then delete it. It‚Äôs totally up to you whether or not you want to talk to your ex again, and ignoring them is a great way to keep them out of your life.

* Sometimes, exes will try to worm their way back into your life when they see you thriving. If you‚Äôre doing super well and your ex isn‚Äôt, they might be reaching out because they regret breaking things off with you.
* You might also want to ignore their message if you‚Äôre dating someone new. Responding to an ex can be hurtful to a new partner, which is the last thing you want if your relationship is going well.
* Don‚Äôt feel obligated to respond or react if your ex tries to send you a gift, either.

**8. Try not to get your hopes up if you want to get back together.**

https://preview.redd.it/1ufbrxn3hkkf1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdd31a6fc376dacaeedd3bde9a65988520c9efda

**An ex reaching out doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they want to get back together with you.**

¬†Exes reach out for a lot of reasons, and wanting a relationship again might be one of them. However, your ex might also be reaching out because they want closure, because they want to be friends, or because they just want to hook up one last time.

* It can be a shock to get a random text or phone call from your ex. Although your mind might be racing, don‚Äôt assume you know what they want until they tell you.

**9. Ask to meet up if you're hoping to rekindle the relationship.**

https://preview.redd.it/r66xscwehkkf1.jpg?width=721&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf61c3e1a2282db5ebc74a633e05150f33a8de8a

**An in person convo is a better place to chat about your feelings.**

¬†If your ex reaching out seems like a blessing in disguise, you might still have feelings for them. Put some feelers out by letting your ex know that you want to hang out or have a chat with them. If they agree, they might just be open to getting back together with you.

* ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs nice to hear from you again. Wanna grab coffee this week?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you texted me. I have something I wanna talk to you about. Can you come over soon?‚Äù

**10. Work through any problems before getting back together.**

https://preview.redd.it/qxm8n03mhkkf1.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87f368645fe8bf1dad68528c3e5b63c9407c0509

**Trying your relationship again could lead to an on-again off-again situation.**

¬†While the idea of romancing your ex again might be tempting, think about why you broke up in the first place. If those same issues are just going to rise to the surface, you might not want to get back together (especially if you haven‚Äôt talked about those problems yet).

* These push-pull relationships can really take a toll on your mental health. The constant questioning and worry about your relationship rarely leads to a healthy, beneficial partnership.

**11. Reply to any late-night messages the next day.**

https://preview.redd.it/218mlbqvhkkf1.jpg?width=721&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74b1c38c2d2a5cb3baf6ef2167b2d048f55022f7

**Late-night texts or calls could mean your ex is drunk or lonely.**¬†

Chatting with your drunk ex probably isn‚Äôt something you want to spend your Friday night doing, and they might not remember all of it in the morning, anyway. If your ex reaches out past 10 pm, leave them on read until the next morning.

* Definitely don‚Äôt respond to any ‚ÄúYou up?‚Äù texts, since that could mean your ex is looking for a booty call.",1,1755867107.0,u_MindfulLoveJourney,0,1.0,False

So my ex girlfriend and I split about a month ago. I was the one who broke it off because frankly I was in a really rough place and I didnt know how to navigate the situation. So for context

I had a family member who is really important to me pass away. And it was a long and painful death. And I've never dealt with grief before. And in my spiraling my partner and I weren't getting along the best. And instead of communicating that to her we sort of iced each other out for a few weeks after that. Then I in a moment of idiocy. Broke it off. I said im not getting the support I need and I think us fighting isnt going anywhere good. And broke it off. It was dumb of me because I thought this is my person. Though alot of introspection and self improvement I understand she was also being impacted by the death of the family member. And honestly I left at a really shit time. Its been a month and week since we have broken up and shes still really angry at me. She thinks that in the future if stuff happens ill repeat the behavior. And she frankly has very little trust in me. So how do I go about fixing it. Im seeing her tommorow for a coffee and I dont expect just one date to make up for everything. I doubt she even views it as a date. But I want to show her that. It was a mistake and I am here and I am committed to trying and bettering the relationship. Any advice? 

Edit: for some additional context. My ex has BPD as well as abandonment issues so I understand to her its a very massive thing. She basically told me she can never really view me in the same light again. And im hoping this is just because she is angry and not her actual feelings. But I want to show up and I want to make things right because I genuinely do love this girl. ",1,1755867085.0,relationship_advice,10,1.0,False

If a guest came to the wrong hotel, ask if he's thirsty and offer some tap water.

Do everything possible to make the guest not feel embarrassed, unless he crosses the limit. So if someone takes a coffee and thinks it's for free, just say ""Would you like to make the payment now, sir?"" instead of ""Coffee is actually paid here. ü§ì"". And if some boys are playing cards a bit too loudly, just saying ""excuse me, you may play cards here but please refrain from disturbing the other guests üôÇ"" rather than ""Can you boys stop making such a ruckus?! Jesus!""

It's better to sit elegantly than stand leaning onto the wall or with the elbows on the desk (99% of bosses don't understand this).

If a group of people are checking in together, say welcome or good day/evening for every time the door opens, and try to have eye contact with several of them when speaking.

Hand the key with both hands to East Asian guests.

Smile less when it's someone from the Slavosphere in Europe, they see smiling as fake. If you have been there you have probably noticed that public-facing employees don't smile very much, it's not because they are ""poor"" but because of different etiquette.

Do not use contractions like ""don't"", ""can't"", ""haven't"" etc. in e-mails.

When (not if) Opera Cloud shits on itself, instead of acting awkward or irritated, just try to distract from the situation with small-talk until you reload the programme.

1mx5foi,https://i.redd.it/ra7ghobkgkkf1.jpeg,People are completely misunderstanding EOMM and it's making any discussion about the topic impossible,"DISCLAMERS: 1) This is going to be a long post, so get your coffee now and buckle in, and 2) I'm not going to get into the mathematical theory behind the machine learning models, since I dropped out of my data science master's degree precisely because I hated getting into the mathematical theory behind machine learning models. Someone else can do that if they want.

First of all, EOMM is **NOT** a category of matchmaking systems. It's a proprietary matchmaking system developed by Electronic Arts in 2017. You can read their paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06820 (NetEase refers to this paper as Chen et al.)

However, just like we call all adhesive bandages for ""Band-Aid"", people have started calling all engagement-focused matchmaking systems for ""EOMM."" That is not correct. Not all adhesive bandages are ""Band-Aid"" and not all engagement-focused matchmaking systems are ""EOMM.""

You might have seen the name EnMatch (**En**gagement-oriented
**Match**making) show up on this subreddit. That's because it's one of NetEase's newest iterations of *their* proprietary engagement-focused matchmaking system. You can read their 2024 paper here: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/28760/29460

Here is part of the abstract: 

> Matchmaking is a core task in e-sports and online games, as it contributes to player engagement and further influences the game‚Äôs lifecycle. Previous methods focus on creating fair games at all times. They divide players into different tiers based on skill levels and only select players from the same tier for each game. Though this strategy can ensure fair matchmaking, it is not always good for player engagement. In this paper, we propose a novel Engagement-oriented Matchmaking (EnMatch) framework to ensure fair games and simultaneously enhance player engagement. [...] The performance of EnMatch is finally demonstrated through the comparison with other state-of-the-art methods based on several real-world datasets and online deployments on two games.

That sounds an awful lot like what you would call ""EOMM"", right? That's because it *is!* You think of *all* engagement-focused matchmaking systems when you're saying ""EOMM"", but that is not what NetEase is referring to when they say ""EOMM."" They describe EOMM in the following segments of the 2024 paper:

> Previous research focuses on creating balanced games, where closely skilled players are matched to create competitive gameplay, assuming that balanced teams are the most desired matchmaking outcome for players. [...] Hence, through this approach, all the players in one combat have similar gaming skills so that the fairness of games could be well ensured. However, is game fairness the only critical factor for player engagement? In most matchmaking scenes, the answer is no, which has been demonstrated **in EOMM (Chen et al. 2017).** Using churn rate as an indicator of player en- gagement, EOMM analyzes the impact of match win-loss outcomes on player retention in 1-vs-1 scenes and shows that fair games are not sufficient to ensure player engagement. However, it still remains unexplored in scenes that contain multiple players in one team, i.e., k-vs-k mode. [...]

> Note that in our k-vs-k scene, rather than selecting players from the same tier or forming 1-vs-1 games as in previous works, each player needs to be well estimated under multiple possible team composi- tions. This results in an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with non-linear objectives, which can not be efficiently solved by tier-based heuristics or the graph matching methods (Chen et al. 2017) proposed for 1-vs-1 games. Furthermore, the complexity of player interactions necessitates cross-tier matching, resulting in a significantly larger exponential search space. [...] Thus, when the focus shifts from fair game to engagement, a new combinatorial optimization solution is required.

> It is due to these difficulties that we propose a novel engagement-oriented matchmaking framework, named EnMatch. EnMatch includes a new engagement modeling method that introduces players‚Äô granular gameplay performance (including player interactions, players‚Äô roles within a team, etc.) as additional supervision information, and a team formation algorithm based on recently developed Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO).

As you can see yourself, NetEase acknowledges EOMM as a separate and *specific* matchmaking system developed by Electronic Arts in 2017 which focuses on increasing engagement in 1-vs-1 matches. However, since they're working with multiplayer games, they're developing their own matchmaking system called EnMatch, which seeks to do the same in many-vs-many matches.

The EnMatch model was designed, deployed in two popular online multiplayer games (called SVP and RPGPVP in the paper) and tested against multiple other matchmaking models (such as EOMM and GloMatch) and was shown to improve engagement compared to previous models.

Here is a description of some of the things which NetEase found that the EnMatch model must take into account when trying to find a match. They did so by analysing match results of a popular 3-vs-3 game:

> Fair teams are composed of players with the same tier, while diversity teams are composed of one high-tier player and two low-tier players. [...] For each game, we divide players into ‚Äúmain players‚Äù and ‚Äúsupport players‚Äù.

> We present player interaction results in Table 1. It shows that diversity teams have a 12.3% decrease in downvotes when they win the game. Meanwhile, regardless of game win-loss results, diversity teams have a higher chat frequency (by 19.2% and 7.1%, re- spectively) and a higher upvotes rate (by 15.8% and 10.3%, respectively). These statistics provide a strong indication that players of diverse teams are more likely to establish collaboration relationships, thereby improving in-game engagement. On the other hand, the results also show that ensuring fair games alone is not sufficient to maintain a good user experience, and cross-tier matchmaking is necessary to optimize player engagement.

> We calculate averaged churn rate and present results in Table 2. Firstly, for the players winning three consecutive games, i.e., the players in ‚ÄúWWW‚Äù rows, the results show that the main players have a lower churn rate when compared with support players (4.9% and 5.9%, respectively). Conversely, for the ‚ÄúLLL‚Äù games where players lose three consecutive games, the main players have an obviously larger churn rate than the support players (8.4% and 6.2%, respectively). These reflect that, besides game results, the player role in the game is also an important factor for long-term engagement. Moreover, we also find an interesting phenomenon that main players with three consecutive winning games (‚ÄúWWW‚Äù + ‚ÄúMMM‚Äù) do not have significantly lower churn rates than all other scenes: the lowest churn rates in ID 1, 2, and 5 are similar or even better than the churn rate of ID 4. This suggests that diverse win-loss experiences and diverse game roles can lead to higher game engagement of players.

So, with this kind of data, the model will not necessarily care about creating fair matches. It will care about keeping you engaged. While fairness and win-loss streaks are important parameters that the model *does* take into account, they are far from the only ones or the most important.

Looking at Table 2, we can see that support players had about the same churn rate after 3 losses (6.2%) as they had after 3 wins (5.9%). Meaning, it will absolutely put you into what feels like a losing match as the best player on a diversity team if it calculates that you're statistically more likely to keep engaging with the game. On the other hand, it will also do the opposite and give you what feels like easy matches if *that* keeps you engaged.

That's what's so nefarious about engagement-focused matchmaking systems. They're not one-size-fits-all depending on skill level but tailored to the individual players. You might have a completely different experience with the matchmaking system than someone else in the same rank and role simply because you main different heroes.

When NetEase says they're not using EOMM, they're talking about *one specific* engagement-focused matchmaking system developed by Electronic Arts in 2017. Meanwhile, their players believe they're talking about *all* engagement-focused matchmaking systems, since most players colloquially refer to all these systems as ""EOMM.""

Unless NetEase straight up say ""Our matchmaking algorithm does not take any engagement metrics into account when creating matches"", they have not sufficiently refuted the claim that they're using what's colloquially known as ""EOMM"" - i.e. an engagement-focused matchmaking system.

So, the question isn't really whether or not NetEase make use of engagement-focused matchmaking. They absolutely do, and they publicly admit so whenever they release another research paper or lecture on the topic.

No, the question is whether or not you personally believe that they're not using it in Marvel Rivals, even though they spend millions upon millions on the development of engagement-focused matchmaking systems, or if you believe that NetEase would use technicalities to obfuscate the truth so that they don't get into a shitstorm for using matchmaking models that make them a ton of money.

1mx5adu,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1mx5adu/did_coffee_cause_my_heartburn/,Did Coffee Cause my Heartburn?,"I completed my first extended fast last night (4 days) and began my refeeding process at 4 with 12oz of chicken bone broth. It was shortly after that I began to feel very slight heartburn. An hour later I had 4 scrambled eggs lightly seasoned, and the heartburn got worse. 2 hours after that I had a lightly seasoned baked 4oz filet of cod, and the heartburn remained until around 10pm.

I had read that all three of those items should be okay when refeeding, as I've never had issues with eggs causing stomach issues before. So I started doing some research and found that coffee can cause issues on extended fasts, and since I consume roughly 16oz of black coffee every morning during a window of 8am-12pm, I thought it might have been the underlying cause.

I felt so great during my fast, and it really bummed me out that I hated the refeed so much. Was the coffee the culprit, or perhaps something else? Or is that just normal stomach behavior after breaking a fast?

I was waiting in line for my usual morning brew and noticed the person in front of me was wearing a hoodie with a band I used to jam out to in high school.

Honestly, it was a bit nerve-wracking. My heatt was betaing fast and my mind kept second-guessing whether I sounded stupid, but tuns out, they were super cool and we ended up chatting briefly about music.

Alt text: Business professionals meeting in a corporate setting, representing Bahrain company formation and sustainability. has doubled down in 2025 on its strategy to position Bahrain as the Gulf‚Äôs go-to for green business‚Äîbacked by the government‚Äôs National Action Plan for Sustainable Development (launched February 2025, official summary here). Compared with neighboring UAE and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain stands out for its zero corporate tax for most businesses, straightforward process, and strong support network‚Äîqualities cited by Forbes Business in their recent ‚ÄúBest Green Startup Destinations 2025‚Äù report.\
\
The blend of international ambition and local tradition creates a welcoming environment for both expats and Bahraini entrepreneurs. From Ramadan working-hour adjustments to the unspoken rule of coffee service before business talk, local customs still shape the way sustainable business deals are made.\
\
Are There Tax Incentives for Sustainable Businesses in Bahrain?\
Absolutely. But it‚Äôs nuanced‚Äîand knowing the nuances is everything.\
Understanding Bahrain‚Äôs Tax Landscape\
Bahrain famously has no personal or corporate income tax for most business activities. The main tax applicable is VAT‚Äîcurrently 10% as of January 2025, though certain sectors and green initiatives enjoy reductions or exemptions. Import duties on eco-friendly products and renewable energy equipment are also subject to special, lower rates.\
\
Zero corporate tax: Applies across almost all company types (details here)\
No withholding tax: On dividends, interest, or royalties.\
VAT reductions: On qualifying green technologies and sustainable goods.\
Import duty exemptions: On EVs, solar panels, and select renewable imports under the 2025 ‚ÄúBahrain Green Import List.‚Äù\
\
New 2025 Green Tax Incentive Update\
In March 2025, Bahrain‚Äôs National Bureau for Revenue (NBR) rolled out a targeted VAT refund scheme for companies certified under the Sustainable Business Accreditation (SBA) program. This program, managed by Tamkeen and EDB in partnership, offers:\
\
Up to 75% VAT refund on local purchases of qualifying eco-friendly assets (solar, insulation, energy management systems)\
Customs duty waivers for SBA-certified importers\
Priority government procurement for SBA-accredited companies\
\
The SBA application itself can be done via the Sijilat portal with a simple digital upload of your ESG compliance audit, and typical approval times are about two weeks‚Äîif your paperwork is flawless (Insider tip: Always bring paper and digital copies when visiting the MOICT, even post-COVID. I learned this the hard way, facing a two-hour delay at Sijilat reception).\
What Does a Bahrain Company Need to Qualify for Sustainability Tax Benefits?\
Key ESG Requirements and Practical Examples\
To benefit from Bahrain‚Äôs green tax incentives, your business should:\
Purchase or lease certified eco-friendly equipment\
Comply with Bahrain‚Äôs 2025 ESG reporting standards (aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative and local MOICT guidelines)\
Register for the SBA scheme via Tamkeen or directly through Sijilat\
Real-World Examples\
\
Renewable Energy Startups: A solar solutions provider based in Bahrain Bay secured a 60% customs duty reduction on photovoltaic cells under the new ‚ÄúGreen Import List.‚Äù\
Eco-Friendly Construction Firms: A Seef District contractor used thermal insulation materials and water-saving fixtures, resulting in a 50% VAT refund on those assets through SBA certification.\
IT Companies Going Green: A Diplomatic Area software firm implemented a digital-first office to reduce paper waste. They received expedited approval via Tamkeen for a green transformation grant that also made them eligible for discounted licensing fees.\
\
(Side note: Once, my own client‚Äôs paperwork for SBA certification bounced due to missing the latest ESG self-assessment form‚Äîan update snuck in post-Ramadan when half our team was still adjusting to regular office hours. Always check for regulatory updates around Eid and Ramadan. Bahrain‚Äôs business rhythm can change quickly in these seasons.)\
The True Cost of Forming a Sustainable Business in Bahrain (With 2025 Figures)\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation and sustainable business incentives. registration: BHD 350‚Äì600 in government fees (full breakdown here)\
- SBA certification: BHD 120‚Äì350 (variable by business size)\
- Sustainability compliance audit: BHD 250‚Äì1,200 (outsourced)\
- Annual bookkeeping/accounting**: BHD 450‚Äì1,500 (see professional options)\
Ongoing costs (licensing renewals, VAT filing, ESG compliance) are generally 20‚Äì30% below similar services in Dubai or Riyadh, partly due to streamlined government support via Tamkeen.\
Expert Tip: Register your company and apply for SBA status at Diplomatic Area‚Äôs One-Stop Shop before 11 AM on weekdays. Early birds avoid long queues caused by post-Ramadan workflow lulls and enjoy quicker approvals.\
Major mistake to avoid: Many entrepreneurs submit incomplete ESG documentation. Always pre-prepare ESG reports in both Arabic and English, anticipating any sudden policy shifts or new form requirements, especially post-major holidays.\

\
W.L.L. (Limited Liability Company): Most popular for SMEs\
SPC (Single Person Company): Popular for startups and solopreneurs\
Branch/Representative Office: For established foreign companies (entity types explained)\
\
2. Secure Premises and Prepare Documents\
Choose a sustainable office hub‚ÄîBahrain Bay and Seef District offer good rates, energy-efficient buildings, and fast Sijilat approvals.\
Prepare these documents:\
- Directors‚Äô/shareholders‚Äô passports, CR extract, lease agreement, ESG policy statement, sustainability business plan, and Tamkeen/ESG forms (always double-check latest forms with MOICT).\
3. Apply for Commercial Registration (CR) via Sijilat\
Submit your application through the Sijilat portal. For sustainable businesses, attach SBA pre-approval or green project proposal for faster MOICT review.\
Insider Shortcut: Have a local sponsor only if entering sectors requiring it (details here); many sustainable sectors allow 100% foreign control.\
4. Complete ESG Compliance and SBA Certification\
Schedule your ESG audit before finalizing licensing. Use a reputable auditor who knows Bahrain‚Äôs 2025 ESG rules (my go-to: GreenBridge Consultants‚Äîfast, bilingual, and know the Tamkeen quirks).\
5. Register for Tax and Apply for VAT Refunds\
After CR approval, apply for VAT number (if applicable) and submit SBA documentation to access green VAT refunds and import duty exemptions.\
6. Set Up Bookkeeping and File ESG Reports\
Maintain meticulous records‚Äîdigital and paper. Engage licensed accounting firms to manage monthly VAT, ESG filings, and keep you updated on regulatory changes.\
Compliance, Ongoing ESG Management & Insider Networking Tips\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for Bahrain sustainable businesses.\
Bahrain‚Äôs business culture values relationships. Attend majlis-style networking events in Seef and the Diplomatic Area; informal connections often speed up official processes much more than emails alone. During my own first SBA submission, it was a 10-minute coffee session with a LMRA contact in the lobby that saved me days of back-and-forth clarifications.\
Common entrepreneur pitfall: Delaying registration for annual ESG audits, then scrambling as reporting deadlines hit close to Eid or other local holidays. Mark these dates in your business calendar and always initiate renewals a month early.\
Free Zones & Location Choices: The Green Edge\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain's sustainable business ecosystem.). Many are piloting solar infrastructure grants and discounted eco-friendly warehousing in 2025.\
Seef District and Bahrain Bay remain the top picks for clean-tech or sustainability-focused headquarters, not only for their infrastructure but also for proximity to regulatory bodies and potential business partners. Plus, they‚Äôre a quick hop to the EDB‚Äôs main office‚Äîuseful for urgent document drops when digital submissions just won‚Äôt do.\
Brief tangent: Once, during a power outage in a Diplomatic Area office (blame a rogue AC unit, not the grid), our team moved a key ESG review to Seef‚Äôs coworking lounge. The switch actually sped up the process thanks to the lounge‚Äôs on-site Sijilat kiosk and coffee (plus, surprisingly, a few impromptu legal consultations from neighboring entrepreneurs).\
Practical Tips for Saving Time & Money (Local Wisdom)\
\
Always pre-book your MOICT and Sijilat appointments online‚Äîeven one week out can make the difference between a same-day approval and a three-day wait.\
For document preparation, use bilingual templates and bring both digital copies on thumb drive and hard copies on official letterhead.\
Apply for Tamkeen funding before your main CR submission; their new ‚ÄúGreen Transformation Grant‚Äù (launched January 2025) can cover up to 40% of your SBA-related costs.\
Avoid forming your company during peak post-Ramadan periods‚Äîoffices are notably slower as normal business hours resume.\
Leverage local business support groups in Seef and Bahrain Bay; often, a quick WhatsApp to a Tamkeen field agent can clarify the latest form or eligibility rule.\
\
Biggest challenge I ever faced: A client‚Äôs green tech import got stuck at customs due to an outdated product certificate. Solution? Visit the EDB‚Äôs Diplomatic Area walk-in counter, get the latest Green Import List confirmation in writing, and present it directly at the port‚Äîshortcutting what would‚Äôve been a week-long delay.\
Support Services: Who Can Help You Succeed?\
\
Alt text: Professional business support and consultation for Bahrain company formation.\
1. Can a foreigner own 100% of a sustainable business in Bahrain?\
Yes‚Äîmost green sectors allow full foreign ownership thanks to Bahrain‚Äôs liberal investment framework. Check the latest sector-specific ownership allowances for updates.\
2. What‚Äôs the total cost to start a green business in Bahrain?\
Expect government and registration fees to run BHD 350‚Äì600 for most LLCs, plus BHD 120‚Äì350 for SBA certification (detailed cost breakdown). Factor in audit and accounting costs‚Äîsee options.\
3. Are there additional reporting requirements for sustainable companies?\
Yes. SBA-certified companies must file annual ESG reports and undergo a third-party ESG audit at least every two years‚Äîhandled via MOICT and Tamkeen (compliance info).\
4. Where‚Äôs the best location for a sustainable business office?\
Seef District and Bahrain Bay are highly recommended for their modern, energy-efficient buildings, networking opportunities, and proximity to government offices. Free zones also offer strong incentives for green businesses (zone guide).\
5. How quickly can I get tax incentives or VAT refunds?\
With complete documents and SBA pre-approval, green business VAT refunds and incentives are typically processed within 15‚Äì20 business days‚Äîmuch faster than most GCC countries.\

For the latest guidance and expert support, visit KeyLink Bahrain, explore sector-specific news via Gulf News: Bahrain, and keep up with official updates on bahrain.com and the Reuters business portal.\

I'm down to share photos, too. 

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, and Ark ASA. Just bought Palworld, too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago.

But it always left me drained.

Recently I tried something different: instead of adding pressure, I removed friction.
- I set up a simple ‚Äúwriting ritual‚Äù: same playlist, same chair, same time of day.
- I gave myself permission to write badly on the first draft.
- I stopped measuring progress by word count, and instead by time spent engaged.

The crazy part? My output actually improved. The words come faster, and editing feels less like punishment.

Curious do you measure progress by word count, time, or something else?",7,1755865133.0,AO3,4,0.82,False
