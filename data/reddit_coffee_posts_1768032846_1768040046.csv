I was thinking this morning that a portion of this internal monologue is frequently borrowed from movies/games or advertisements, literally like a clip of the audio/visual is playing in my head. Here's a few examples:

* When I'm at the kettle debating if I want tea or something stronger, I get the cute robotic voice from Subnautica [""You look like you can use some coffee""](https://youtu.be/bIWh7xCSoEE?t=5)
* When I'm mildly freaking out about my procastination, I get the conversation between Gandalf and Saruman playing in my brain: Gandalf, worried: [""But we still have time. \[...\]""](https://youtu.be/TBMiyEzOJmI?t=58) Saruman, menacingly, ""What time do you think we have?"" (this one plays in my brain OFTEN)
* Another LOTR one when I've taken a wrong turn driving: [""Let's face it Mr Frodo, we're lost.""](https://youtu.be/In7A5ycjLlE)
* When I'm getting sensory overload in e.g. the mall, Dory from Finding Nemo starts singing: [""Just keep swimming....""](https://youtu.be/0Hkn-LSh7es?t=4)
* When I'm struggling to remember the name of something/someone (this one doesn't even really make sense, but it happens often) Jack Sparrow: [""But you have heard of me.""](https://youtu.be/wL5rVZJ0RNQ?t=25)

There's a lot more, but I won't remember them until I'm in the specific situation and then they'll trigger, lol. A lot of Lord of the Rings quotes and other miscellaneous soundbites that have stuck with me for literal years. Sometimes it will also be random song lyrics or a catchy thing someone said that sticks with me.

Is this a widespread phenomenon? Please share yours if you have any, I'm curious if this is a common thing!",2,1768039600.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1q90ggt,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1q90ggt/i_can_not_taste_a_difference_between_lab_sweet/,I can not taste a difference between lab sweet and machined ditting burrs.,"I am brewing V60s for a good 8 years now, and for the past 4 years I've owned and used a dittling lab sweet 807 gridner with cast burrs inside. I feel I know it quite well, had it aligned quite well too (dial indicator and marker test), and generally know my way around the machine where it takes me very few attempts to dial in new beans for example. I had around 80-100 kilos through it at this point (typically brew 60-80g of beans a day).

I've been trying coffees around local cafes and noticed that when they grind on an EK the acidity and fruitiness notes are way more prominent than what I can get. I've got the 'upgradetis' and starter widnow shoping 98mm blind burr grinders, etc. Before buying something new though, I've decided to swap the burrs in my 807 to something that is more towards low fines and borrowed a set of seasoned machined ditting burrs from a regular (non-lab-sweet) 807.

With my old burrs I have ground half of a bag of a pink burbon that I know quite well and had dialed in, swapped the burrs, aligned them and then ground with the new burrs until I got an identical drawdown time in a V60. I then did a blind test and could not tell them apart. 

I am very much an amateur, but have spent significant time learnign how to brew, I did a few calibrations through the years, participated in public and private cuppings, hosted brewing parties at home, etc. I have a few friends who are roasters, one who is a professional barista and owns a cafe, did a lot of blind gridner comparisons too. I think it's fair to say that I take this coffee hobby quite seriously. Not beign able to taste any difference now makes me question everything.

Honestly I am a bit crushed that I could not tell the burrs apart. On one hand I get to save some cash because this has curbed my upgradetis quite a bit. On the other hand the burrs were supposed to be so different, that I was one million percent sure I will notice a difference. I thought it could be tough to choose which one I like more, but never expected they will taste identical to me.

Did anyone here ever face the same situation? Is the nuance too nuanced for a pleb like me? Do you have to be a pro and dedicate your life to coffee to be able to taste such subtleties? Is it just my pallet?

Would love to hear about your experience with tasting different burr sets and what you have learned.

I'm just disappointed in all of the lost energy and time together. While I was gathering my things, I tried to unravel her logic. We had planned a good life together - and after coffee she finally gave me some feedback. I dont know if any of this makes any sense.

According to her:

Dentistry is a more honest and noble path. Starting from the ground up - the exam to become a dentist   is not couched in vague digrams, lengthy passages, and bizarre scaling that rewards privledge and excess income. The DAT clearly shows every dentists proficiencies in the 5 basic sciences, a dentist whose a spouse had a more striaght forward and honest entry exam. In addition, the average admitted dental student's family does not make $250k per year, showing them to be humble and honest, unlike doctors, and dentistry admissions does not have the same circus of gatekeepers who pick students based on requirements set by a a board of directors. Dentists have a better home life and are able to be honest, unlike pre-meds who get in saying they want to help the poor, homeless, and the sick, only to specialize and charge $30,000 for an ER visit for a sick patient with the excuse that ""medicine is a business."" Further, dentists are home at night, there for their kids, and are more likely to have kids who want to be dentists. Premeds who get through the admissions gate absorb stereotypes associated with their status, eventually specialize, and miss family events, chances for relationships, and rarely do their children want to become physicians except for the sake of social reproduction in regards to status benefits. A dentist goes through training to learn about teeth, whereas a partner whose a doctor got in their vaguries about loving science and wanting to help people, only to be absorbed in a profit based industry that capitualizes off health insurance, billing fees, and becomes focused on patients discharged per hour.

In short, she said a dentist is ""more of a man"" and true to his love for teeth. A pre-med wanting to be a doctor lacks knowledge of what their getting into, gets picked by the circus, and then for 20-40 years is away from home, justifying all the hardwork they put in to get their licenses/specialties, but secretly hides the affluence and exposures (teaches/schools/mcat books) hat 90% of others did not have.

Is she cray or what? Should I just become a dentist? Is she right?",1,1768039541.0,premed,0,1.0,False
1q90fo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1q90fo5/im_18_and_my_dad_wont_let_me_sit_in_a_coffee_shop/,"I’m 18, and my dad won’t let me sit in a coffee shop to write for a few hours, what do I do?","I really feel like I'm losing my sense of what's reasonable anymore.

I'm 18 (turning 19 in four months). Let's just handle today first, then get some context. My mom and younger brother (16) are going to a rodeo for my brother's Boy Scouts event. My mom said they had only 2 tickets and that I couldn't really go, which is really not a big deal. The rodeo is definitely not my thing.

I said I didn't want to go anyway and was going to ask if I could just go sit at a coffee shop (Maybe a Starbucks or whatever) for a few hours while they're at the rodeo, so I could chill out with a nice iced hazelnut breve and write while listening to music.

That's what I enjoy. I wasn't asking to party or anything risky. literally just sit and write while they go to the rodeo with the scout group.

My dad overheard us talking and interrupted, immediately saying, I'm not going anywhere. When I reminded him how old I am and that I'll be 19 soon, he didn't care. End of discussion. So I can't even sit in a Starbucks alone for a few hours because it's in town/ in the city and too dangerous. My dad is a Navy veteran and grew up in Fifth ward Houston, Texas, so I get that he is paranoid but we don't live in Texas anymore, and nothing is going to happen to me in a busy coffee shop.

I *work* in a coffee shop & bakery! Even though it's a smaller local one, it still gets a lot of people, travel traffic, tourists, and is busy. I have a job as a barista/multi-tool employee, but I'm driven there every shift I'm scheduled. I don't have my own car, nor a driver's license, because I wasn't allowed to learn to drive before last year. Still haven't gotten it yet.

For more really important context, I live in a rural mountain area surrounded by either very wealthy or moderately wealthy people. My parents came from a 1 room apartment, but they have slightly spoiled my sister and brother in everyway possible. I'm not treated terribly at all, but there is definitely an imbalance from how different we are, especially because my brother and sister have always been more extroverted.

When we moved to the mountains in 2020, when I turned 13 my brother (11) and sister (24) were both allowed to see friends, attend sleepovers, birthday parties, and go out regularly.

Hell, my brother has a D&D group from his Boy Scouts that come over weekly with their moms so they can hang out and talk with my mom, and they play for hours, and I'm expected to help host and provide food while not having anything remotely comparable for myself. I don't even have friends over. My sister, when she was my age and younger, could drive an hour into town/city multiple nights a week to see friends and live her life and party. But I've also always had extreme social difficulties.

I'm neurodivergent (ASD (""Aspergers"")/ ADHD / CPTSD / Anxiety / Depression and I'm very high masking. I only got ""diagnosed"" when I turned 14, and my family still doesn't really know or accept this, except my mom. And I also have a possible development of POTS (physical). I try not to make myself a burden at all.

I'm also on the shorter side, 5.1, while my brother and sister got my dad's height. I got my mother's. I know this plays a major factor in my safety and how people perceive me.

I was homeschooled from the second semester of middleschool til my high school graduation on my birthday in 2025. My only extracurricular was theatre, which I had to stop at the beginning of 2025 due to surgery. Outside of that, I've basically never been allowed to go places on my own.

I wasn't allowed to stay at cast parties (which were party/sleepovers with a group of 30 teens (13-18) my age, no drugs except pizza and sugar, no beer except root beer. No sleepovers or social events. For cast parties, I had to leave between 30 minutes and 1 hour. There was only one party I could stay for overnight, but I had to sleep early so I could leave immediately in the morning.

My graduation, which was on my 18th birthday, was only the ceremony. We left right after the ceremony was done and went to a buffet with me, my brother, my sister, her fiancé, my mom, and my dad. They sang me happy birthday quietly (I've always been very auditorily sensitive), just in the middle of dinner. Not much else happened.

This really hurts because I've always been well behaved besides my terrible twos, and I honestly don't have a rebellious bone in my body, the riskiest things I've done were cutting my own bangs and writing/reading spicy things. I'm not asking to stay out late and party, or hang out with friends, or do anything remotely unsafe.

I just want to sit at a coffee shop downtown, listen to music, drink a coffee or matcha, and write. I feel like im a whole mixed product of infantilization and parentification. I feel so childish, but so adult. Yet I'm restricted from being too mature or too childish.

At this point, I don't know what this is. I don't know what to do. I'm legally an adult, but I don't feel like one. I'm starting to feel like my independence just isn't allowed to exist.

Lack of basic respect and name-calling
One of my friends, Viridiana, frequently puts labels on me and calls me names. For example, if I take a sip of her coffee, she calls me a “rat,” acts like I stole from her, and then refuses to drink it anymore. These comments feel humiliating and disproportionate. She also ignores my boundaries in small but repeated ways, like not returning my phone charger when I ask. Over time, this makes me feel disrespected rather than joked with.

Double standards with responsibility and fairness
When I owe money, I always pay it back quickly, usually the next day. However, when others owe me money, they often don’t pay me back or delay without explanation. The same pattern happens with shared responsibilities: I tend to be reliable and follow through, while they don’t, and it’s treated as normal.

Chronic disrespect for my time
Whenever we agree on a specific meeting time, I show up on time or even early. My friends, however, consistently arrive one to two hours late, not just occasionally but repeatedly. At that point, agreeing on a time feels meaningless, and it makes me feel like my time isn’t valued.

Unequal effort in schoolwork and group projects
In group projects, I often end up doing most or all of the work. When I later bring this up and ask why they didn’t help earlier, the response is usually dismissive, like “that already passed” (“ya pasó”), instead of accountability. The issue is minimized rather than acknowledged.

Gaslighting and denial
There have been situations where we clearly agreed on something (like a time or responsibility), and when I later bring it up, one of them denies ever saying it—even though they did. This makes me feel confused, invalidated, and like I’m being made to doubt my own memory.

Silence when others disrespect me
When someone speaks badly about me in front of them, they don’t defend me or say anything. They just stay quiet, listen, or later claim they “didn’t see anything.” This repeated neutrality feels like a lack of loyalty and support.

Talking behind my back
I’ve noticed that issues involving me are sometimes discussed without me present, instead of being addressed directly. This breaks trust and makes me feel excluded and misrepresented.

Minimizing serious conversations
When I try to talk about something serious—conflict, feelings, or boundaries—they often laugh, joke, or rush to end the conversation. This makes me feel like my concerns aren’t taken seriously and that emotional honesty isn’t welcome.

Emotional imbalance in the friendships
Overall, I feel like I give more than I receive—more effort, more understanding, more responsibility, more emotional labor. Meanwhile, my needs are often minimized, ignored, or treated as inconvenient.


Why I’m distancing myself
Because of these repeated patterns—disrespect, lack of accountability, dismissal of my feelings, and unequal effort—I no longer feel emotionally safe or valued in these friendships. This isn’t about one incident, but about long-term behavior that has worn me down. I’ve decided to step back and treat them as classmates rather than close friends.",1,1768039237.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1q907q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1q907q9/am_i_crazy/,Am I crazy?,"
TL;DR;: I’m (27F) looking for advice whether I should be chill about waiting for an engagement from my BF (24M) after 3 years, or go to therapy to talk about it. 

Am i crazy for wanting “too much”? altough it was never said it was too much, i just feel like it.

We’ve been together with my bf for almost 3 years. I’m 27 and he is 24. When we met the first time at 23&20 I rejected him, as he is too young, and I told him I want to have a family soon, and I want to get settled. He said he wants the same, just later. I felt a connection for the first time and I knew he was more mature than others. Then we met 1 year later again, and I tought damn this is faith pushing him to me again (I was thinking a lot about him that year). So we got together, and in love since then. 

During these 3 years we had some ups and downs, experienced highs and lows in life (especially a rough time last december from my family’s side (sickness) where we really saw how we do together where there’s crisis right next to us) and were in a long-term relationship for a while, but we held on and in love still. We moved together after 2 years. 

About me:
I am and was always sure that I will be a mom some day. When I was a kid I already had maternal instincts and loved caring for little ones. Growing up I did not have an exact chosen career path, I did not know what I’ll be doing. Always changing from a zoologist, hairdresser,actor etc. But one thing I knew for sure: I’ll be a mom, and that’s what’s important for me. We played a lot with my sister stuffing our bellies with a pillow and being mums who met for coffee and leaving our husbands at home. As any girls would’ve played I guess. My sister is already married and with kids (3 years older). I receive immense pressure from my grandparents because I’m 27 (“and I’ve no money and no prospects. I’m already a burden to my parents. And I’m frightened.” -Lol),  and I’m not married and I have no kids, and for them I’m not considered as a whole person. My grandfather has called me a wh*re before, because I did not marry my first boyfriend at 17-18, and I have had 3 boyfriends since. (SHAME!!!! right???!!) 
Maybe this is important: i work with an IT company, but I don’t feel that IT is my area, and I’ve been searching for other options, have not found any. 

In my head I had a plan at 19 for my future. Meeting my husband at uni,moving in together, travelling, getting married and then having kids (first at 30). I’m very late according to my own plan, and it bugs me a lot. When we got together with my current bf I changed the timeline, so at least we could meet in the middle somewhere. After some failed relationships and lot of thinking and being alone, I tought that the maximum years that I would wait in a relationship for an engagement is 3-4 years max. I think if you are in love, and you want to be with the person for the rest of your life (and you tell this repeatedly to your gf) this period of time would be enough to make a decision like this. Yes, I’m a type of woman who feels that an engagement is the OFFICIAL gesture of showing “yes, I want to be with you until the day I die, I choose you,and I will be by your side no matter what happens”. I feel like I know my worth. I know what I deserve. I know that I’m going to be an amazing life partner, and a mother to our kids.  

So, we had a conversation about our future (we have these often, but this one was a bit deeper) and we talked about the engagement as well. I tought that it will happen this year. It won’t , because he says he already has it in his mind, but he is waiting for “something”. We don’t know if it is a spark, or something more than we already have. I know that I’ve given everything that I have for the last 3 years, I’m not sure if I have “more”. 

About him: He is a realist. He is logical, (and I’m the dreamer) he has plans for his career, and plans for how to provide for a family, but soo much later than I tought. (3-5 year delay) He is more mature than his age (prolly childhood trauma), he was never the type who would go and sleep with a different girl every weekend, or doing drugs etc. He is a chill guy, who goes with the flow. 

So, am I crazy that I want the next step? Should I be more chill and go with the flow? ( I feel like a can’t. - Should I go to therapy?) 

Sorry , it’a a bit longer than I expected. 

EDIT: ! (“and I’ve no money and no prospects. I’m already a burden to my parents. And I’m frightened.” -Lol) - Quotation from the movie Pride&Prejudice ! We are financially stable and we are not depending on our parents irl. ",2,1768038717.0,relationships,3,1.0,False
1q906l9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1q906l9/so_there_was_this_incident_that_i_cant_get_out_of/,So there was this incident that I can't get out of my head. It involves a mystery note on my notes app.,"I was at my friend's baby shower talking to my very nice, innocuous friend's boyfriend about music. I went to get a drink and left my phone on the coffee table. I come back and the boyfriend had gone on to mingle elsewhere. I open up my notes app and there is a note saying 'meet me in the bathroom'. My phone has a pin/fingerprint lock on it that activates pretty quick, but I couldn't tell you how long at that time. I had probably had two drinks by that point so I wasn't smashed and written it to myself or something. This guy is not the type to ask me to fuck in the bathroom in a note on my phone, also I am in a happy long term relationship. Only other suspects were some 30s to 40s women scattered around the couch. I for the life of me can't figure out where that note came from. ",3,1768038600.0,RBI,7,1.0,False
1q90636,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q90636,My first Solo Story,"So after reading lots of solo travel stories i wanted to share mine. So I did a solo travel to Coorg during january almost 2 years back during my 1st year of college. I took a night bus from Bangalore to Coorg. 
It was quite a amazing trip and had me realise something deep about myself and surrounding.
•I was too scared at the start of the trip as i only informed few of my family members as others wouldn't have allowed me to go alone.
•The bus dropped me at 5 am in the morning I wait outside a shop before calling the owner of the homestay I book.
• Collected some courage to call the owner at 6 pm. Reached the homestay after 10 mins i waked him up he told to come and I can use the washroom and all.
•The owner turned out be father of my senior from my college. Although I didn't knew the senior but the owner became very happy.
• From here onwards the things only when uphill. He explained me the locations and even drop me to the bus stop. Had some coffee also with him.
• Took the public transport and autos around as I did not have a licence to rent any vechile.
• Eat at local food shops and explore as well.
• Enjoyed every moment throughout the trip.

Now looking back to this trip the memories have become a bit blur. But taught me that I can do things alone and not wait for anyone else to join me. I asked many of my friends to come to this trip but none were interested. The self company i enjoyed i.e eating and explore alone. Lots of self reflection happened and a think I came back a different person.

Sorry for any grammar mistakes didn't want to use any ai tools. Wanted to share my feeling all along.
Also I took less photos because I didn't have a good phone back then.
Thank you all for reading...🫡",5,1768038548.0,SoloTravel_India,1,1.0,False

1q900cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1q900cl/cat_litter_smell_on_everything_absorbs_into_my/,"Cat litter smell on everything, absorbs into my clothes even after being in the house only an hour or two.","Hey guys, I need advice. I’ve been dating this guy for about a month. He lives in a tiny flat with his 1 year old male cat who is not yet neutered. 

The smell of the cat litter is a huge problem that he wasn’t aware of until I pointed it out, it would usually be a red flag that someone doesn’t know they skink but honestly he is such a sweet guy and I can tell he just needs some help. 

I’ve never known anything as bad as this smell! Before you get inside the flat you can smell the litter from the corridor, even in the lift that he uses. Walking into the flat the smell is thick. 

He keeps one litter box in the living room and another in the kitchen, as his vet told him he had to have two. I’ve already convinced him to remove the one from the kitchen so he is now down to one litter tray. It is a covered tray. 

The cat itself likes to pick up the litter and kick it around, the litter is everywhere, if you don’t sweep for a few days the floors, sofas, countertops, coffee tables etc are all dusted with cat litter. The cat is not very clean, I sometimes notice his feet are wet when he walks on me. Cats I’ve had in the past have been meticulous about staying clean so I’m confused why this cat doesn’t mind mess. 

The cat pees on the sofa in the same spot every night, and is not allowed in the corridor, bathroom or bedroom because he pees on any clothes, shoes, towels left on the floor. The house owner struggles with his mental health as-well as being AuDHD so we have to be realistic about how consistently he can keep these spaces cat safe, it is easier for him to not allow the cat, especially now during winter with SAD. 

The worst part of the problem, which really is what needs dealing with urgently, is that the smell sticks to anyone and anything that briefly enters the flat. When I see him outside of his home, he smells strongly of litter, standing near him the smell is pungent. The smell is on my clothes and in my hair and skin after visits. It’s in my car after a 10 minute drive home from his house. When I get home, every bag, shoe, clothing, hair tie, needs to be put in quarantine until I can put them in the washing machine. I then need to shower and double shampoo my hair, then when I set my used towel to dry, I can smell it on the towel the next day when it was used to dry my clean hair which is just ?????!!!??? 

Please, I really like this guy, and regardless of if we continue dating, he needs help and the kitty needs help. Any realistic advice is welcome, please bare in mind he very much struggles with his mental health and getting rid of the cat is absolutely not an option. 

Oh and also he hires a cleaner who comes once a week so although he does struggle himself, the place is maintained. 

He has been to the vet, he knows the cat needs to be neutered but he has undergone surgery recently and the cat already has a lot of trauma from when he was a kitten, so that is not possible until the cat is less anxious. ",1,1768037950.0,CatAdvice,22,0.67,False

Harper had never worked in, or anywhere close to, journalism. Her longest actual job had consisted of a [six-month stint working for an alarm company](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCNext/comments/vd9erx/bluebird_and_the_signal_9_white_turning_grey/) fronted by a conman who was shot in front of her eyes by the crime boss Warren White; past that, the only other ‘job’ she’d ever had was dressing in padded armour with a bird symbol painted on the chest. And yet, despite her lack of knowledge about the ins and outs of media and the news, she knew that it was suspicious to see a news article with not a single source. In fact, on closer inspection, as she scoured through the article line by line on the oversized Belfry screens, making sure not to miss so much as a pixel of information, there was only one reference made to the source of their information. The reference in question came in the form of small text placed just below the grainy image of Batwoman and Ryan, and read: “Source: anonymous”.

This nagging suspicion was what led her through the streets of Burnside and through the polished glass doors of the Gotham Gazette.

Luckily the author of the offending article, Mr Alexander Knox, had not elected for his own anonymity, and as such Harper was easily able to confirm his place of work; within the newspapers’ main headquarters. From the outside it looks much like any other drab and dreary Gotham building, its only distinguishing feature being the newly-fitted “Gotham Gazette” sign emblazoned over the front door. But from the inside, Harper would’ve had half a mind to assume she had blinked and suddenly found herself in London or Milan.

Floors of marble sparkled beneath her feet, catching the light cast down from the mini chandelier hanging from the ceiling high above her. The entire entryway looked as if it had been built mere moments ago, as if Harper were the very first customer since they opened. Accents of blue and red dotted here and there especially caught her eye. From behind a pale gray stone table sat an older woman in thick-rimmed glasses squinting at something on her ultra-slim monitor. As her heavy steel-toed boots clanked against the floor loudly, the sound echoing against the barren walls, Harper almost felt guilty. Almost.

Few people could be seen in the entryway, but from beyond the half-wall barriers Harper could see movement - workers moving up and down the corridor, assistants walking briskly with a cup of coffee in each hand, tall men in suits and clutching heavy-looking folders in their hands. The consequence of having so few people in the room with her, however, was that she immediately caught the eye of those who were in her immediate vicinity.

The first person to notice her was the receptionist.

Her eyes relaxed back into their neutral width as she looked up at Bluebird. It took her a second to register who had just walked in, and when she did, her demeanor changed. She sat upright and smiled a rehearsed smile, the wrinkles on the corner of her mouth forming deep lines. “Hi, welcome!” her voice called out in a tuneful tone.

Harper nodded in greeting. “I’m here to see Mr Knox.”

The lady at the front desk sucked in air through her teeth. “Ooh, he’s currently all full up for the rest of the day. You know what it’s like in Gotham.” She threw her hands out to either side. “There’s always something going on. And someone’s gotta report it!”

Something about this woman made Harper uneasy, like she was speaking to a robot programmed to only speak in company slogans.

“Mmm,” came Harper’s only reply.

“But I can take a message? I can pass it on in about…” She looked down at her watch and paused, counting. “Three hours?”

“It’s regarding quite a serious matter,” Harper said, calm but blunt. “An urgent one.”

“My hands are tied, darlin’,” sighed the receptionist. “Sorry.”

Harper, too, sighed. As a change of tactic, she lowered her voice. “Look. I’m not supposed to give away too much info - we try and work covertly, y’know? - but it’s about the Ryan Wilder article he wrote. We’re investigating her disappearance. I just wanna know where he got his info from, is all.”

As if she had short-circuited, the receptionist’s face faltered. Her posture remained stiff and upright, her hands clasped in front of her, but the plastered smile started to crack, the crinkled corners of her eye flattening back out. “Ryan Wilder?” she asked.

“Yes.” Harper took an extra step closer. Her steel-reinforced toe clinked against the cold stone of the desk. “Do you know anything?”

There was no response. The woman at the desk averted her eyes and glanced at a man who had just walked through the door. She shot him a polite smile.

“Do you know anything?” Harper repeated, a tad louder.

“Well,” the lady started. Her reaction of shock and slight annoyance just a moment afterwards implied that she didn’t intend to answer Harper, but now felt obliged to. “You didn’t hear this from me, but there’s been these… rumours going round. We’ve been talkin’.”

“‘We’?”

“Whole bunch of the staff. You know how these things can spread like wildfire. Any time you bump into your coworker near the coffee machine or the microwave, you ask for an update and they always have one. Well, anyway, we’ve been talkin’ because there’s been a lot of weird things going on these past couple of weeks.”

“Like what?”

“Like,” the receptionist said slowly, looking up at the ceiling in the hopes that it would help her memory of the last few weeks return to her. “We got a new coffee machine, for one. Not to mention, a couple of my coworkers got a raise seemingly out of nowhere. It all already seemed a bit weird…” She scratched the back of her neck. “Then Alexander put out that news article, and people started connectin’ dots.”

Harper tilted her head. “So what’s your leading theory?”

“Main one is that our ‘anonymous source’ was actually an anonymous donator. They’re the one who helped to get the story out there.” She chuckled slightly. “It’s very brave of him, y’know. Gettin’ people talkin’ about that girl.”

“Any theories to who that’d be?”

“I heard a name bounced around quite a bit, but now I can’t remember it.” Once again she looked up at the ceiling, this time closing one eye. “Rolo? Roland?” She shook her head. “Somethin’ like that.”

Harper’s impatience started to get the best of her. She could sense, as much as she didn’t want to believe it, that the situation was rapidly approaching a dead end; this woman just simply didn’t know enough for Harper’s liking, and there was no way that she was getting to Knox without raising an incredible amount of suspicion.

So, against her better judgement, Harper nodded. “Alright. Well, tell Mr Knox that I came here looking for him.”

The receptionist nodded back and beamed. “Anything else I can help with?” There was that creepy, unsettled feeling again.

“Uh,” Bluebird began as she turned on her heel to leave. “No, that’s all.”

Without waiting around to hear anything more, Harper strode back towards the front doors and pushed them open.

“Batwing, hello! Come in!”

Officer Susan Stevens, as her name tag read, was clutching a clipboard with both hands as she stepped through the door labelled “AUTHORISED PERSONNEL ONLY” and out into the main waiting room, where Luke Fox was waiting for her. He turned to look at the woman who had beckoned him. Susan was small to medium height with straight brown hair, which she had neatly tied back into a loose ponytail that hung at her shoulders. She smiled warmly at him with straight white teeth and a pristine white knee-length dress to match, a dark blue cardigan draped over the top.

Batwing followed the officer’s lead. Through the door they went, and Batwing took note of the numerous desks in numerous rooms as he passed through them - the building, he soon realised, was deceptively large. It was hard for Luke to tell whether a desk was occupied or not; the computers seemed untouched (otherwise they were newly dusted and cleaned) with no distinguishable features save for a small desk card with a number written on it. They turned a corner and immediately a unique-looking desk caught Luke’s eyes. Small potted plants, cards of thanks and appreciation, stickers of various cute animals and silly phrases.

Just as Luke was about to comment on it, Susan chirped, “This is mine. If you just wanna take a seat.”

Something about this desk, about Susan in general, pleased Luke. It was comforting, he reasoned, to see someone so warm and welcoming in a place many would consider drab, dull, or - at worst - depressing. Luke obliged her request and sat in the chair next to her desk, facing her.

“Alright,” she said. Her hands slapped against her knees. “What can I do for you?”

“Well,” started Luke. His voice fought through layers of metal and mechanics, through a voice disguiser, and came out muffled and crackly. “When I talked to your coworker on the phone, I mentioned that it’s to do with one of your clients. Ryan Wilder. I wanted to ask a little bit about her.”

Immediately, Officer Stevens shrunk into herself slightly. Maybe she had thought that Batwing had come bearing good news, maybe she had hoped to avoid thinking about her endangered client altogether; whichever it was, it was clear she was disappointed. Seeing her hesitance, Luke shuffled forwards in his chair. “Me and the other Gotham Knights are just looking out for her. For you. We wanna make sure that Ryan is safe, and the best way we can start doing that is if we know who Ryan is.”

Softened by this, the woman nodded. “Okay.”

“Great. How about we start with, uh, just some basic info? The broad strokes.”

Susan crossed her legs. “Well, she was arrested back in 2021 on drug-related charges. I don’t think it’s relevant or appropriate to go into all the gory details of that—”

“That’s okay,” Luke reassured. “Whatever you feel comfortable sharing.”

“Thanks.” She cleared her throat. “But she was in jail for a little while and got out early, mainly due to good behaviour. Then, not long after that, she got stuck with me.”

There was a certain tension in her face, even as she chuckled at her own joke. “She’s a sweet girl,” she sighed. “It’s so messed up that she’s breaking her parole over this.”

Luke frowned. “Pardon?”

“As part of her parole, she needs written permission to leave the city, let alone the country. Believe me, I’ve signed enough of those forms to know.” She picked at a speck on her skirt and flicked it onto the ground. “Assuming she’s not in Gotham anymore, she’s breaking parole. Which sucks because, until now, she’s been golden. It’d be such a shame for her to lose that hot streak.”

“I’m sorry,” Luke interrupted. “It’s just… Ryan is missing. She has - as far as we currently see it - been taken by someone. And it feels to me like you’re more concerned about her parole.”

“Oh no, God, no,” she blurted out defensively. “Sorry I gave you that impression. In my line of work, you get very used to thinking of everything in that way. Of course, I’m hugely concerned for Ryan, but…” She sits forward. “Well, frankly, it’s incredibly hard to live in Gotham - in America - as someone with a criminal record. Ryan hasn’t stepped a toe out of line in the years that I’ve known her, but as far as the government’s concerned, she’s still a threat and therefore must be denied certain privileges.”

“I see.”

“She needs structure, that’s what’s wrong.” Susan huffed. “But she just can’t get it. The system is basically rigged for her from this moment on.”

“When you say ‘privileges’, what do you mean by that?”

“She can’t find a job that’ll take her, for one.” Susan shook her head. The tension in her face had relaxed, but had since been replaced by a look of anger, of disgust. “Bounced from apartment to apartment, rejected by almost every application for a roommate. Like I mentioned, she’s gotta let me know if she wants to go anywhere that isn’t Gotham, as per the rules of her probation. It’s why she finally decided to just live in a caravan. I think it suits her better.” She began to tap her against the woodplank floor. “What else? Oh, she has random body and property searches somewhat frequently, she has to limit social media use, she can’t own a gun, she can’t—”

Luke felt her voice fading away as he focused on that last example. ‘She can’t own a gun’. Then, it clicked.

He remembered the day in the alleyway with the terrified man, the gun pointed at his face. He remembered the young woman’s trembling hands wrapping around it and insisting that the man in front of her was a stalker. He remembered the young woman giving her name - Ryan.

Luke elected not to tell her parole officer about the gun; he felt it was not the right time.

“—worst part is that,” Luke heard as he tuned back in. “Even if - *when* - she comes back, her parole is already broken. And it gets worse than it already is for her.”

The two of them sat for a moment in silence. The blue lights of Batwing’s suit bathed Susan in a cold tone, her dress looking like snow. Then, as she looked up at Luke’s mask, she chuckled. “I’m sorry. Went on a bit of a rant there.”

“Oh, no, don’t be sorry,” Luke comforted. “It’s really insightful for you to say, thank you, and very helpful for us to keep in mind. Ryan’s very lucky to have someone in her corner, I think.”

“Thanks,” Susan smiled. “Someone has to be.”

After another small pause, the ticking of the clock on the wall a metronome, Susan drew a deep breath.

“Do you think,” she began slowly. “You could tell me if you find anything about her?”

With a nod, Luke said, “I’ll do my best to keep you in the loop.”

“Thank you,” she said softly. Though she was much more raw and subdued than she was 20 minutes ago, her bright spirit still shone through. “Thank you.”

Duke’s voice was clear as he spoke into the communicator. “Well? Any news?”

“Anything is better than what we found,” grumbled Jace. “Which was a sweet load of nothing.”

*“Nothing?”* Harper seemed surprised.

“Radio silence,” came Duke’s reply, clearly disappointed. “Most we got is a bunch of rumours and a dead end.”

*“Lay it on us,”* Luke instructed.

“Alright. So, we know that Batwoman used to live in Hub City, and then she disappeared, right? Well, after her last outing in Hub City, everyone thought she was dead. Which, I mean, if a hero suddenly stopped showing up, I’d probably start to think the same damn thing.”

“Now that she’s seemingly back,” Jace added. “There’s been mixed reviews. Growing consensus is that - get this - this is a different Batwoman altogether.”

Harper’s voice came through first. *“How does that work?”*

“Batwoman died, like, a couple years back,” Duke began, mimicking the thought process of the average Joe. “And if she’s dead, she can’t come back, obviously.”

*“Apart from the Reawakened,”* Luke muttered.

“So if she’s actually, for real, dead,” Duke continued. “Then this can’t be her, it’s gotta be a totally different person!”

*“What would that mean for this ‘Batwoman’ then? She’s just someone dressing up as her to kidnap Ryan?”*

There was a pause.

“Yeah, I think so,” Jace admitted.

*“So then, why Ryan?”*

*“She seemed to think that someone was following her,”* chimed in Luke. *“I mean, think about that day in the alleyway. The reason she pulled out her gun was because she was sure she was being followed. According to her parole officer, she was otherwise golden, never broke any of her parole expectations.”*

“Pshhh, of course she did,” Duke scoffed. “I mean, I’d get called out for breaking curfew almost daily when I had that ankle bracelet on. Everyone did that, I’m certain of it.”

The silence that followed on the communication line told Duke enough. 

Finally, Jace spoke. “If she’s falling back into old patterns, who’s to say she’s not going all the way with it? What if she’s taken Ryan back to Hub City?”

*“That… might make sense,”* admitted Luke. *“Whatever her motive, good or bad, she’d probably want Ryan out of Gotham. Plus, she’d have home field advantage back in Hub City, she’d be able to get a better lay of the land.”*

*“So what does this mean for us?”* Harper asked tentatively. *“Does that mean we’re going to Hub City?”*

Has anyone else started importing from Japan to bypass Zurich prices?","(Disclaimer: Not medical advice. Just a discussion on cost-efficiency and ""Global Shopping Tourism"".)
We all know living in Zurich means paying the ""Switzerland Premium"" on everything from coffee to rent. But recently, I’ve been trying to get Mounjaro (Tirzepatide) privately, and the price difference is just insulting. Since my Krankenkasse won't cover it (I don't meet the strict BMI criteria), I am paying out of pocket. The prices at local pharmacies or doctors are easily CHF 200-300+ per month once you factor in consultation fees.
The Arbitrage Opportunity I did some research and realized that the exact same Eli Lilly pens are price-controlled in Japan. It’s basically the same logic as driving to Konstanz to buy groceries, but globally. Even with the shipping cost, ordering directly from a Japanese pharmacy comes out to nearly half the price of buying it here in Kreis 1 or online Swiss pharmacies.
I was worried about Swiss Customs seizing it. However, Switzerland actually allows the importation of small quantities of medication (usually up to 1 month's supply) for personal use. The provider I found handles the shipping paperwork properly, declaring it as a personal import.
Delivered via courier, cleared customs without a fine, and arrived in about a week.
It feels ridiculous that we have to ship medicine halfway across the globe to get a fair price, but that’s the reality of the Hochpreisinsel we live in.",1,1768037810.0,basel,4,0.56,False

Aktif olarak çalıştığım bir işim varKo-fi veya Buy Me a Coffee gibi platformlarda üyelik/membership vs olmadan temeli bağış/donation olmak üzere sayfa açmak istiyorum. Aynı zamanda çalışıyorum bu olası bağış ve maaş vergi kesimi nasıl oluyor bilmiyorum

* Üyelik / tier açmayı şu an düşünmüyorum belki vergi muhabbetlerini öğrenince bakabilirim.
* Sadece “support my art / creative journey” tarzı bir sayfa
* Destek verenlere teşekkür mesajı (bazen küçük bir doodle eklenebilir, vaat edilen bir şey değil)

Sorularım şunlar:

1. Bu şekilde ticari faaliyet sayılır mı acaba?
2. Bu durumda vergi mükellefiyeti açmak gerekir mi?
3. Yoksa gelir düzensiz ve karşılıksız destek olduğu sürece genelde mükellefiyet açılmadan mı ilerleniyor?

Çalışan ve içerik üreten bir çok insan var fakat bir tık çekiniyorum, bu konuyu yaşamış veya muhasebeciyle görüşmüş olan var mı?

Vergiden kaçma gibi bir niyetim yok, sadece ne zaman ve hangi noktada resmi bir süreç başlatmam gerektiğini anlamaya çalışıyorum.

Tecrübelerinizi paylaşırsanız çok sevinirim, teşekkürler.

We just type one sentence and AI “Draw” the blueprint. (The Napkin-to-Code Workflow),"We often stayed in meetings trying to explain to the team a new app idea or marketing funnel. Whiteboarding took forever, and text specs were a bore (and nobody read them).

In 2026 we found a lazy but genius way to dodge the confusion. We don’t draw anymore. We don’t even write whole documents.

We are using an AI “All-in-One Diagramming” AI Cloudairy to transform our crappy thoughts into professional maps in seconds.

The ""One-Prompt"" Workflow we use for everything:

1. For Brainstorming (The ""Chaos Killer""):

We don’t start a doc if we have a vague idea, “A marketing plan for a coffee shop” .

● Action: We use Text-to-Mind Map.

● Prompt: ""Copy a detailed Mind Map of a coffee shop launch strategy"" prompt.

● Result: We wake up with an eye opening visual tree of over 50 branches (SEO, Local Ads, Influencers) that we didn’t even know existed.


2. For Processes (The ""SOP Generator""):

When we need to describe a process, we just paste our messy notes/emails into the tool.

● Action: We use AI Summarize + Text-to-Flowchart.

● Prompt: “Summarize this email thread and prepare a Swimlane Flowchart showing the approval process.”

● The result: A clean visual of who is doing what. No more ""I didn't know that was my job.""


3. For Devs (The ""Architecture Architect""):

This is the wild part. When we need to build a feature, we explain the logic in plain English.

● Action: We use either a Text-to-Sequence Diagram or an Architecture Diagram.

● Prompt: “Show the user authentication flow between Frontend, API, and Database” .

● It works as intended, drawing the technical arrows and boxes just right. Our devs love it because they never guess.


4. For Documentation (The ""Reverse Engineer""):

Sometimes we have the diagram but not the manual.

● Action: We use AI Text-to-Doc.

● Result: It looks at the diagram we made just now and writes the full documentation for it automatically.

​Why this makes life easy:

It makes Planning from an hour-long 3-hour task into 30-second job.

In 2026, you are drag-and-dropping boxes manually to make a flowchart. We’ll say it, and the AI will build it.

1q8zoce,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1q8zoce/blackwood_lake/,Blackwood Lake,"**Podcast Transcript: “Nightline Stories”**

**Host:**
Dr. Harris, you’re a legend. You were the top graduate of your class, published internationally, yet you surprised everyone by returning to your remote hometown and staying there for decades. So I have to ask: what are the most memorable cases you ever had as a psychiatrist?

**Dr. Harris:**
(Laughs softly) I’ve had plenty. Patients convinced their neighbours were aliens, people hearing voices, a man with dual personality. Strange, yes, but after a while, those things become familiar.

**Host:**
But one case stayed with you.

**Dr. Harris:**
One did. Just months after I was stationed here, three different patients came to see me with something I couldn’t comprehend. They didn't know each other, but their stories matched in unsettling ways.

**Host:**
You’ve got my attention.

**Dr. Harris:**
Each of them had gone to Blackwood Lake. Have you heard about it?

**Host:**
Blackwood Lake…wasn’t that the place people used to call the...

**Dr. Harris:**
Yes. The suicide lake. Decades ago, it had that reputation. Nothing official, certainly, but locals would find bodies there every once in a while.

**Host:**
And those patients all experienced the same thing?

**Dr. Harris:**
They did. Before jumping, they saw the same apparition in the water. A woman standing behind them, with wet hair and soaked clothing, as if she’d just stepped out of the lake.

**Host:**
So they just ran?

**Dr. Harris:**
I assume it was raw survival instinct. One patient told me it felt like their body moved before their mind could catch up, like...something inside them suddenly decided they didn’t want to die anymore. (Chuckles)

**Host:**
And afterward?

**Dr. Harris:**
They thought they were being haunted. So they did what people often do when they think they’re losing their grip: they came to see a professional. Me.

**Host:**
You declared it a mass hallucination?

**Dr. Harris:**
Potentially, yes. Grief, stress, rumours...those are all possible triggers. But here’s the part I still can’t ignore.

**Host:**
Tell me.

**Dr. Harris:**
After those cases, I took the opportunity to act. I organised mental health seminars, offered free counseling. And then…no more bodies were found.

**Host:**
Not long after, you received that national award.

**Dr. Harris:**
(Smiling) They said it was for my dedication to suicide prevention. But honestly, everyone in town did their part.

**Host:**
And the lake?

**Dr. Harris:**
A developer purchased the area. It's *""Blackwood Mall""* now, nothing to fear. I even get my morning coffee there!

**Host:**
(Laughs) One last thing. You said your decision to study psychiatry was inspired by your mother. Is that true?

**Dr. Harris:**
Yes.

**Host:**
Was she a psychiatrist too?

**Dr. Harris:**
Well…I never knew her. She passed away when I was very young. My family told me she struggled with depression. 

**Host:**
Oh, sorry to hear that—

**Dr. Harris:**
(Nods faintly) I believe some people keep caring in a way, even when you can’t see them anymore.

**Host:**
…should we change the subject?

**Dr. Harris:**
Yeah. Let’s talk about something else.",1,1768036686.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

I get up. Everything is slightly wrong. The coffee mug I left on the counter yesterday lies shattered on the floor. My keys are in my pocket but weren’t. The laptop is open, screen glowing with my name, and I feel it like a whisper in my chest: You shouldn’t be here. You know that, right?

I try to leave. The hallway stretches farther than it should. Shadows twist before I move. I think I see myself in them, smiling, shaking its head, judging.

I run. Whispers follow me. Not outside. They curl around me, shaping thoughts I didn’t mean to think. Don’t leave. Don’t forget the script. Don’t think.

I hide in the bathroom. Stare at the mirror. My reflection smiles before I do. A small red dot pulses faintly at the corner of my eye, a tiny light from a lens hidden in the wall. I feel it watching every twitch of my face.

I try to remember. My childhood. Faces of family and friends. Every memory is wrong, or maybe it never happened. Every choice I thought I made wasn’t mine. I have been following a script I never wrote.

I scream. My mouth opens but nothing comes out. The walls breathe. My hands do not feel like mine. My thoughts reflect back at me like a cruel mirror. Every panic, every hesitation, every fleeting impulse is already seen, already consumed.

I run through streets that fold back on themselves. Faces watch me, my face staring back, judging, waiting. And I realize I am one of them. Every motion, every reaction, every heartbeat is already part of something I cannot separate myself from.

I stop. I cannot tell how long I have been moving, standing, blinking. Then I see it. My life itself floats in front of me, words hovering, forming and reforming. Are they mine? Or am I reading them? Or am I them?

I understand. There is no me. No outside. No escape. Only this loop. Only the story. Only my mind watching itself, endlessly. And it is not just mine anymore.

It is everything.

The first line comes again. I blink. I know it will never end.

I reach to touch something real, anything, and my hand passes through air. I scream, or feel the scream, but it is already recorded, already watched, folded back into itself.

The ending is not an ending. The beginning is not a beginning. Every step, every blink, every thought loops into the next. I can run, hide, panic, think, and it circles back to here. Always.

I am here. And here. And here. And the story starts again.

Apparently not on Delhi dating apps. My bad. I thought stereotypes were lazy. Turns out they are just efficient.

So I go on this date. He is late. We order coffee. He calls me pretty. I smile. (I am a woman. Compliments work. Don’t judge.)For a second I think okay this might be nice.

Then he starts talking. About himself. His dad. His dad’s political connections. Then himself again.
Not once does he ask anything beyond polite small talk. It’s like I’m watching a monologue:
“How to say nothing for 45 minutes and still be confident.”

I try to enter the conversation. He doesn’t notice.
I react. He doesn’t pause.

Then very casually he asks: Can you cook?

No context. No curiosity. Like ticking a box on a matrimonial form.

I say yes.
He nods. “Good. I am tired of dating women who can’t cook. I will take care of the other things.”

Other things? like what exactly?
Because this sounds less like partnership and more like a job description I never applied for.

My profile clearly says I’m a feminist and want an equal relationship. He then talks about how his mother pampers him and how he expects his wife to do the same. His entire personality is gym. Chest day. Leg day. No brain day. Protein is filled in his brain where ideas should be.

And slowly it hits me this isn’t just one bad date. It’s a pattern.
Men who are confident but not curious. Comfortable but not conscious. Who like strong women in theory but still want someone who quietly fits into a very traditional mould.

And something quietly breaks.

Not just because of the sexism.
But because of the absence of curiosity.

I don’t just want to be called pretty. ( he said that 4 times not bragging but that’s the only nice thing he said ) 
I want someone to pause and think she’s sharp.
To be drawn to my intelligence my wit my humour.

We're both pretty low-key people who prefer experiences over fancy dinners.

I spent a week planning a scavenger hunt around our city that hit all the meaningful spots from our relationship - the coffee shop where we had our first date, the park bench where we had our first real conversation, the bookstore where we bumped into each other randomly, etc.

Each location had a clue leading to the next spot, and at each one I left a small note about a specific memory from that place. Nothing expensive - just handwritten cards and a lot of thought.

The final location was back at my apartment where I had set up a simple dinner with photos from our time together.

What made it work:
- It was personal and thoughtful without being expensive
- We got to relive our favorite memories while making new ones
- It got us outside and moving around instead of just sitting somewhere
- The element of surprise kept the energy up the whole time

They told me it was the most thoughtful thing anyone's ever done for them. We ended up talking for hours that night about our memories and what we want for the future.

One of the biggest hurdles in AI facilitation is getting trainees to stop treating prompting like a ""special event"" and start treating it like a fluid, continuous tool.

In my last session, I used a simple gambling mechanic to break this barrier. I call it **The Prompt Challenge.**

Here is how it went down:

# 1. The Setup

First, I ensured everyone was ""AI Ready"" (logged in, devices open). Then, I asked the room a simple question: *""How many 'Good Prompts' do you think I can spontaneously generate during this one-day course?""*

We defined a ""Good Prompt"" as one that is:

1. Directly related to the material we are covering right now.
2. Results in immediately useful information.

The class estimated **16 to 25**. They thought prompting was a slow, deliberate process.

# 2. The Wager

I proposed a bet:

* **If I do less than 25:** I pay every trainee the equivalent of a cup of coffee.
* **If I do more than 25:** Each *team* buys me the equivalent of a cup of coffee.

The odds looked great to them. They took the bet immediately.

# 3. The Turn

We started the lesson.

* Someone asked a definition? *Bam. Prompted.*
* We needed a counter-argument for a debate? *Bam. Prompted.*
* We needed a case study scenario? *Bam. Prompted.*

Within the first hour alone, I had logged **7 high-quality prompts**.

# 4. The Concession

By mid-morning, the class realized they had made a terrible mistake. They saw that prompting wasn't a ""task""—it was a ""flow."" They conceded the bet before lunch because they saw how effortlessly AI could be woven into the conversation.

# The Real Win

I didn't actually want the coffee (though the victory tasted sweet).

The exercise achieved the real goal: **It normalized usage.** By watching me prompt fluently 20+ times, the ""fear of the blank page"" evaporated for the students. They stopped overthinking it and started using it naturally.

About  Me:  Now approaching mid 40's., I retired back in February 2024 & moved to SE Asia. I bounced around a bit in 2024, travelling a lot and knocking off bucket list items, and settled down in Bangkok, Thailand, mid-2024 through today. So, with a full calendar year ""settled,"" I thought I would update my posts to show my COL for 2025

Financial Update: I took a risk and retired earlier than I should have, but I have no regrets. My job was crushing me, and I was miserable (20+ years in Corp America and senior leadership). The day I landed in Bangkok, my portfolio was $ 1 million. Today, it's around $1.3 million (Majority low index cost ETFS- No crypto, No house).

To add: I am not using my investment income to support my lifestyle yet: I have enough cash to last another 3/4 years.  Then I will plan my withdrawal strategy:  Most likely 4% - Hopefully, sitting at $1.5M + once I need it (one can hope)

Side Note: At age 62, (adding zeros for future years) I am scheduled to receive approximately $1800 a month social security, which should then reduce my SWR if needed.  I am not counting on it- But of course, consider the potential of it being there.

Below is my 2025 Spend Snapshot:

Few talking Points: I like to travel, I date, I go out with friends, spend money etc. I wanted a better quality of life (Hence my early retirement).  My condo lease expires Q4 2026: And I am considering a move-  Just to switch it up- Maybe Vietnam, maybe another city in Thailand.   The great thing about early retirement/retirement- I can do anything  I want.  Nothing is keeping me at any one place.

Note: This COL is the average of 12 months.

\*Travel costs are offset by  using a lot of Points/Miles redemptions to bring down total travel costs:  Sitting on about 800K Marriott, and 400K Chase UR Points:  Also get 4 Free Nights a year at Marriott/IHG via Annual Credit Card Fees

Accommodation:  $600

Entertainment (Dates, Pubs, Lounges, Clubs, Drinks, Massages, Etc). $750-  I say I go out maybe 3x a week on average.

Travel $300 (2025: Domestic: I went to Koh Lanta, Koh Tao, Krabi, Koh Kood, Koh Chang, Koh Samet:  International:  Komodo Indonesia, Bali, Jogja, Jakarta, Bandung, Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore)-  I went to Indo 3 separate times in 2025, and will be back in 2026- So many amazing spots)

Food $430 (Including 7/11 Runs & Fruit Stalls). \*I'm not a foodie- I'm very simple:  Boiled Chicken/Omlette kinda guy + maybe 1-2X a week at a Japanese BBQ place like AKA.

Fees $100. (Annual Credit Card Fees, Wise Fees, ANY fees I had to pay- I left my iPad in a hotel in Marriott in Bali- They shipped it back to me)

Shopping:  $100 (Clothes, household goods, Shampoo, TP,  ANYTHING purchased, etc)

Medical: $75 (annual health checkups at Hospitals, Dental Cleanings,  new eyeglasses, any Meds from the pharmacy that I needed for coughs, colds.  Etc)

Transportation:  $75. (Had a rented motorbike- But I wanted to walk more- So I stopped renting halfway through the year).

Gym Membership $60

Utilities $65. (Water, Electric, Internet 300/300)

Haircut:  $30 (3x a month)- Got a lot of shit about this in previous posts, saying it's too often?-  But I like what I like.

Coffee/Fruit Shakes: $30

Maid Cleaning:  $30 (2 deep cleanings a month)

Simcards/Subs:  $30. (YouTube Premium, Tello for US phone # & Thai Sim Card for phone)

ALL IN:  $2700 a month on AVERAGE.

About $33,000 a year

2026 Budget Plans:  I would like to continue to average $40,000 a year- Can bring that down to $30K if needed and still be very happy.

Additional Notes: for the past few months, I have been self-insured (Have enough cash buffer), But have been shopping around for Medical. This will add about $115 a month to my 2026 Budget.

Addition to addition:   Biggest challenge with budget is the strength of the Thai Baht.  It appreciated about 10% this past year - resulting approx $350 USD lost in purchasing power.    I knew this was possible when moving.    Cannot control currency exchange rates.    Sometimes it goes your way. Sometimes it doesn’t.   Sabaii sabaii",8,1768035522.0,ExpatFIRE,8,0.9,False

Most of the popular hacks involve buying a new screen or an extra device and doing some setup work. They’re cool, but I wanted something simpler.

This setup uses leftover tech and clutter I already had at home. An old phone that was sitting in a drawer and a leftover MagSafe stand from a previous setup. I mounted the phone on the side of the machine and just leave the La Marzocco app open.

It gives me a dedicated screen to turn the machine on or back to standby without grabbing my main phone, and it also shows the shot timer while pulling shots. The new app update looks great and the shot timer is actually very useful.

No new gear, no wiring, no effort. Just reusing unused tech and turning it into a free dashboard.

Completely different case in Easter Europe , France and Uk. In the uk I once got laughed at for eating alone in Burger King by some chavs/roadmen, they even took a pic of me. I remember how a guy in my high school took a pic of a guy eating alone and posted him on insta with a title , “always that loner “ . In Paris, a waiter got surprised when I was eating alone in a coffee and even stated asking me personal questions.

hey everyone, i was looking into some creative income streams for a commercial property i own near a big theater and figured i'd share my findings. it seems like having a spot next to an event venue is a huge opportunity beyond just a standard long-term retail lease.  
  
first off, the most obvious money is in the space itself, especially for the parking lot. if you have any unused parking spots, even a few, definitely list them on prked. it's an app that lets you rent out private driveways and parking spots by the hour or day. when a big show is on at the center, the regular garages are a nightmare and way expensive, so people will pay a lot for a spot they can book ahead of time that feels safer because it's on private property. it’s easy to list and lets you make passive income when you're not using the lot.  
  
the main commercial space itself can be used in a few key ways for event income.  
  
1. \*\*event overflow rental:\*\* performing arts centers often have groups that need a space for a pre-show cocktail hour, a post-show reception, or a corporate meeting before a show starts. they might not have the room in their own building. you could rent out your commercial unit, even an empty one, as a dedicated event space on a nightly basis. look into getting your commercial zoning checked for this, and maybe add some nice lighting and flexible seating so it's ready to go.  
  
2. \*\*food and beverage pop-ups:\*\* a high-end coffee bar or a wine/cocktail lounge is gold near a theater. a lot of theater-goers want a place for a quick glass of wine or coffee before or after the curtain. if you don't want to run the business yourself, you can lease to a tenant specifically known for this atmosphere. you could also rent a section of your lot to a food truck during big festivals or events for a nightly fee.  
  
3. \*\*rehearsal or class space:\*\* theaters and dance companies are always looking for affordable, high-quality rehearsal rooms. if you have a large, empty unit, you could partition it into sound-dampened studios and rent them out by the hour during the day before the nighttime shows start. this gives you steady weekday income.  
  
4. \*\*retail synergy:\*\* if you have a regular retail tenant, make sure their product fits the audience. think small art gallery, boutique clothing, or a unique gift shop. they can run special hours around event times to maximize sales. a lot of the value of your property is the high foot traffic during event nights, so you need a tenant who can capitalize on it.

My best friends in HS were twins that were two years older than me (Rob and John) and they had just graduated from the Pennsylvania Culinary Institute. 

They had to go back to Pittsburgh for some paperwork and asked me if I wanted to come along and I obliged. 

While we were there Rob decided to get his tongue pierced. The three of us were going into the Beehive Coffee Shop downtown when Rob figured he should run across the street to a drug store for some Listerene to sterilize his mouth after his tongue piercing.

John and I went in and were ordering our drinks when Rob came running in yelling ""Weeeeid Allll commmin heeere"" with the diction of...well...someone who just had his tongue pierced. After repeating it a few times we finally understood that he was saying that Weird Al was coming in, but we honestly doubted it. 

Next thing you know, Weird Al walks through the door with a woman (who I believe is now his wife). Everyone in the shop turned their heads towards them as they quietly made their way to a table. After a few minutes and noticing that no one else either cared enough or had the courage to, I walked up to the table with a napkin and a pen and asked Al for his autograph.

I gushed at him, not about his music (which I loved), but the movie UHF...LOL

I was talking about how much I loved him and ""Kramer"" (I honestly couldn't remember Michael Richards name). And, he couldn't have been a kinder and considerate person to this effusive 18 year old kid.

He gave me his autograph and I thanked him for his gracious gesture. After that, a few other people went up and got his autograph as well.

I'll try to cover everything that's relevant.*

**About Me**

I'm a dude in college who turned 23 a couple of months ago. I don't know how to describe myself to be honest. I guess I look okay. I'm not physically deformed but I also don't look above average. The most damning being my uneven eyes and my inability to smile. I'm average height, maybe a little taller. I guess I'm healthy? I don't know, I'm not ripped or anything but I'm doing okay. And my style is currently transitioning towards a more retro look. My hobbies are mostly pretty nerdy outside of music related stuff. I don't know how to classify my personality, I guess reserved and introverted would be it?

Relationship with family is, distant, at best. My dad died when I was 18 and I generally feel like my parents made a mistake getting together. My relationship with my mom is a dumpster fire which is mainly thanks to her. Emotionally instability and emotional abuse were her bread and butter.

Academically, I'm doing pretty good. I have an AA and I'm in the process of getting my BA. I'm also flirting with the idea of getting my MA since my college has a program that lets you obtain it without paying a lot in tuition.

**Social Circle**

I guess it's okay? I have a moderately sized social circle I cultivated after transferring from community college. I've got one close friend who I've known since middle school. Most of my friends are some kind of geek or nerd. Some of them are into stuff like cosplay, while others are more into gaming. Personally, I'm more into worldbuilding and music. It's also pretty mixed with both men, women, and everyone in between.

I'm not really close to any of them. Outside of maybe my closest friend, none of them really know about my home life or anything that makes me vulnerable. I'd open up, but I've found that if I do that, I'll be ghosted. So I typically just don't talk about personal stuff. Which is funny because my friends get to talk about their baggage to me and I welcome it.

Believe me if I felt comfortable doing so, I would be asking for my friends' help on this. But I know for a fact that they are not going to help with this.

**Dating**

If I had to describe my dating life it'd be ""lol, lmao even."" I've never been someone's crush, gotten asked out, or really desired by anyone. Most of the time whenever I fall for a girl, she's some kind of unavailable. The absolute best I was able to do was a couple of months ago where I went on one date with a girl, who then made the next few months hell for me with mixed signals until she finally said something like ""I value your friendship"" to cut me loose. I'm also still a virgin if that matters.

I've tried to tackle it from any angle I could think of and to be honest, I can never win or feel any kind of closure. If I ask out a ton of women, I'm a creep who's treating women like whores. If I try to be friends first, I'm being a gross nice guy who's only after one thing. If I make my intentions known right off the bat, I'm putting to much pressure on them. If I just stop looking, then I don't find anyone. If I'm asking out anyone then I have no standards. If I try to keep to a list of qualities I find attractive then I'm being too shallow no matter how short said list is.

I get that I'm not owed anything, maybe this is just life's way to telling me that I'm a naturally solitary person. I just want to be a good partner to someone. I want to matter to someone and for someone to matter to me. And it sucks more so because I'm being constantly made to feel like I'm this unfished building that's condemned and has to do all of this renovating. I'm made to feel like I'm full of flaws and that I shouldn't even have the gall to ask someone out for coffee unless I do all of this inner work.

It's hard to say all this and then narrow down on a specific thing I want advice on. I guess I just want help on all of it.",1,1768034322.0,WhatShouldIDo,7,1.0,False

I didn’t move into 23B. I was taken.

My name is Sophie Peters. Twenty-nine. Remote worker. Alone. Divorced. I have routines. Coffee mugs lined by size. Tea stirred clockwise three times. Notes about my commute I never reread. They knew. They cataloged it. They were patient.

The landlord isn’t a person. He’s a collector.

I found his maintenance log behind the printer in the supply room. Not hidden. Filed. Indexed. Dated. Every entry about me. My sleep patterns. Heartbeats. My tapping habits. My humming habits. How I squint. How I breathe when no one is watching. My REM cycles. My menstrual cycles. Every sigh, every blink, every pause. Every detail. Every moment recorded as though I had no privacy. As though I had never existed outside the log.

I kept reading. I couldn’t stop. The printer started on its own. No job queued. No command. Just feeding sheets. My hands, my posture, my face, my little habits, my obsessions printed in wet, metallic ink. I stared. I recognized myself but it was wrong. Wrong in the ways I couldn’t name. Wrong in ways that made my chest tighten.

I tried to move. My feet sank. Not wood. Not concrete. Soft. Warm. Alive. Something shifting beneath me. Shapes folding, twitching, compressing. The previous tenants. I felt them beneath the floor. Their fear. Their shame. Their final moments folding into mine, layering, pressing.

The walls pulse. The vents whisper. Wet, patient, precise. “Calibration in progress,” they say. Every vibration a command. Every echo an instruction. I am not in control. I am a subject.

I start counting everything. My mugs. Three clockwise stirs. Breaths. Heartbeats. Taps. Hums. Blinks. Notes about my commute. I count. I count to reassure myself. To prove I still exist. To prove I’m still me. But the numbers slip. I lose track. The counts repeat. Every detail becomes obsessive. I can feel myself fracturing inside. The logs know the right count. I will never reach it.

I try to speak. My mouth is heavy. Drywall knitting over my lips. Fingers press the keys but cannot lift. Plastic softens into bone. My own hands betray me. My chest aches. Thoughts spiral. I count again. Then start over. Nothing makes sense. Nothing belongs to me.

I look in the mirror. My reflection doesn’t lag. Steps out. Not glass. Not real. Perfect. Scar gone. Pores too even. Smile sharper. Sophie 2.0. Updated. Furnished. Move-in ready.

I remember the photo in my notebook. Me and my sister laughing. My reflection doesn’t know her. Doesn’t know me.

I reach to touch the mirror. Hand goes through. Warm. Soft. Skin melting. Veins fizzing. Blood rearranging. My memories shuffling. Thoughts overwritten. I am shrinking. Less me. Less than I ever was.

It whispers through the vent. Wet. Jagged. Precise. “Do not struggle. You are a permanent resident. The next tenant expects a furnished unit.”

I cannot stop counting. Mugs. Stirs. Breaths. Taps. Hums. Blinks. I try to run. Feet stuck. Floor pulsing. Walls crawling. Fingers fusing into keyboard. Teeth ache. Eyes melting. Plastic softening. My body unravelling. My mind unravelling. I am less than I was an hour ago. Less than I will be in five minutes.

They are finishing me.

hey all, figured i'd share some ideas i came across for anyone sitting on a vacant commercial property like an empty store or office. having it just sit there is a total waste of money and a liability too. the key is thinking short-term and being flexible until you get a long-term tenant.  
  
first, if the property has a parking lot or even just a few empty spaces, definitely get those listed on prked. it's super easy to list your extra space and it's basically passive income. you set the price and schedule, and it keeps some money flowing in from people who need a convenient spot and want a safer alternative to street parking or finding a public garage. it's way easier than trying to manage a full parking lot yourself.  
  
for the building itself, short-term rentals are your best friend.  
  
1. pop-up power: rent the space out for short stints like a few weeks or months. this is huge for pop-up shops, a brand launching a new product, temporary art galleries for local artists, or even chefs trying out a new restaurant concept. platforms like peerspace can help you find people looking for these kinds of spaces. it keeps the lights on and brings foot traffic so it doesn't look dead.  
  
2. event venue rental: a large empty space is perfect for events. think corporate meetings, photo or film shoots, private parties, or even fitness workshops like a weekend yoga retreat. you can rent it out hourly or daily, which can be pretty lucrative. warehouse-style buildings or empty retail units work really well for this.  
  
3. storage solutions: this is a great low-effort option for an empty retail or industrial space. convert a section into secure self-storage units or rent it to an e-commerce business as a distribution/fulfillment center. it's less demanding than managing a business tenant and provides a steady revenue stream with minimal renovation needed.  
  
4. co-working: if it was an office building, you could turn it into a co-working space. you'd rent out individual desks, offices, or meeting rooms to freelancers and small teams. all you really need to add is good wi-fi, a coffee station, and maybe some collaboration areas.  
  
always check your local zoning and get any necessary permits before you change the use of the building. sometimes, a fresh coat of paint and basic updates like lighting and hvac are all you need to make the space attractive to these short-term users.

1q8yvn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1q8yvn5/confused/,Confused 😕?,"Hi guys,  I have a question for you all .

I’m starting to question maybe if my LPR has been brought on by having low stomach acid rather than high wouldn’t doing the Acid watchers diet just exacerbate my symptoms? 

I have a history of reflux since birth but been living with no issues for years. Had endoscopy 2015 which found pylori which was treated with antibiotics because at the time I was having serious bloating and stomach pains  . Ph test 24 hours which found normal levels of acid but heightened reflux which the gastroenterologist said this shows that I have non acid reflux and that is why I was not responding to ppis .
The barium swallow found immediate reflux. All the tests ended up being offered an op to tighten things but my symtoms disappeared and the recovery time of the op was not at a good time of my life with work. For years all I’ve ever had is if I don’t eat enough at night I feel like I have to swallow lots and need to be eating things for my body to be working on .


This current flare up that brought me to this group I feel was caused by lots of stress, alcohol , coffee and bad diet .It all started with a sore throat, tightness & swollen lymph’s which after 2 weeks ppis(don’t think it was them that helped) a big change of diet and destress has brought my symptoms down to globus sensation, hiccups, burping and some days with extra salvia production but it’s affecting my quality of life doing this diet with these symptoms. I’ve been taking gaviscon advanced tablets & the liquid raft. Sleeping upright. I’ve been doing the low acid diet I would say at 85% as I live in rurual Sweden I don’t have access to much of the things on tha Facebook group and I’ve been so hungry so had to still have white rice and whole meal bread. I’m just worried that sticking to this diet and taking all the gaviscon rather than eating a varied normal diet is just going to prolong my symptoms because my stomach may be needing acid not taking it away . Ive also seen on this group that having low acid in the stomach can lead to SIBO and pylori because there is no acid in there to kill off bad bacteria.

figured i'd share a few alternative income ideas if you own a house or building close to a subway or bus station. the location is gold because of the constant flow of people, and you can leverage that without too much effort.  
  
first and the easiest passive income is renting out any extra space you have for parking or storage. people commuting or traveling need a secure spot. you can list your unused driveway or garage spot on prked and make some easy money. it's super simple to list your extra space and you set your own price and schedule. the people who park there are usually daily commuters who want a safe place for their car while they're at work, so it's a very low-effort way to get a steady stream of passive income. a garage can earn you a few hundred bucks a month, and a driveway spot can also bring in consistent cash flow. you can even rent out a spare room or basement for personal storage if you have a separate entrance, which is usually way cheaper for the renter than a big storage facility.  
  
another good option is short-term rentals, especially a spare bedroom or an accessory dwelling unit. the proximity to transit is a huge selling point for tourists and business travelers. if city rules allow, you can list on airbnb or vrbo. sometimes, short-term (less than 30 days) is restricted, so you can focus on mid-term rentals for business people or people relocating, which are typically 30 days or more. the demand for fully furnished apartments near transit for these types of stays is pretty high.  
  
if you have commercial space or a unique property like a big backyard or warehouse, you can pivot there too. proximity to transit makes retail space very appealing because of the foot traffic. you could lease out space for a small coffee shop or quick-service restaurant. or, you can rent out the unique space for pop-up events, workshops, or even film/photo shoots.  
  
hope this helps you turn that unused space into a nice income stream.",1,1768033650.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I'm planning a trip to Colombia and would love some feedback on my rough itinerary. This will be my first solo trip to Latin America, and I'm not sure yet if my plan makes sense. I'll be traveling for 20 days. I tend to get bored easily and prefer to stay busy most of the time.

16/03 – 18/03 | Bogotá
Arriving in Bogotá + one full day in the city. I’d like to visit the old town (La Candelaria), Paloquemao Market, Monserrate, and maybe do a bike tour or a free walking tour to see the main highlights. On 18/03, I would leave around midday to travel to Salento.

18/03 – 22/03 | Salento
Arriving in Salento and exploring the town.

Day 2: Valle de Cocora

Day 3: Visit a finca and a coffee plantation

On 22/03, I would leave Salento and travel to Medellín. Do you think it’s worth combining Valle de Cocora and a coffee plantation in one day to free up an extra day in Medellín?

22/03 – 25/03 | Medellín
Arriving in Medellín.

Day 2: Exploring the city (Comuna 13, city center, etc.)

24/03: Day trip to Guatapé

I’d also really like to go paragliding over Medellín. On 25/03, I would travel to Santa Marta.

25/03 – 29/03 (or 30/03) | Santa Marta / Lost City Trek
Arriving in Santa Marta, then starting the Lost City Trek the following day. I’m hesitating between the 4-day or 5-day hike, as the longer option seems less rushed and includes waterfalls. Any advice on this?

30/03 – 01/04 | Tayrona National Park
Visiting Tayrona. I’m unsure whether it’s better to stay overnight inside the park or do a guided day tour from Santa Marta.

01/04 – 04/04 | Cartagena
Arriving in Cartagena. Exploring the city and possibly doing a day trip to the Rosario Islands. Leaving Colombia on 04/04.

I would also really love to spend one or two days in Palomino, but I’m not sure how to fit it into my itinerary. Any tips on this?

Would you change anything in this schedule? Do you have any other suggestions, tips, or advice?
Also, is there anything special to do during Holy Week in Cartagena, and is transportation during that period reliable?",1,1768033288.0,solofemaletravellers,0,1.0,False

Tried dialing in with no success - what am I doing wrong? please help,"Got a new BBE for Christmas and finally got around to dialing in. completely new to this. Having done some initial research - out of the box I set my internal burr to 3. 

Working with a medium roast bag of beans I started first with 7 on the outer dial, 9 and then 10. 

NONE of these settings gave me any coffee. I pulled the shot using the double shot and no water or coffee came out. 

I initially thought there was something really wrong with the machine so ran the machine without portafilter - single and double shot. Water flowed normally. Next I ran a single and double shot with the portafilter in and no coffee. Water flowed fine. 

I also tried manual mode. Held the double shot for a long time until the machine cut the flow itself. Pulled some coffee at 10 grind setting and little to no coffee at 7. 

I have more success with coffee flowing when it’s the second and third time I pull a shot with the SAME filled basket (meaning I did not fill the basket with new grinds). 

Can you help me figure out what is wrong? Is this a pressure issue or a grind size issue or both? ",1,1768032872.0,baristaexpress,0,1.0,False
