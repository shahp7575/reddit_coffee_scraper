Does anyone know if Brü has been mentioned previously? Is it some firm of hybrid drink capable of being brewed for different occasions like Coffee liqueur?

There are a couple things I’ve done that have helped – like, eating more protein. Eating more protein was definitely a significant factor in my B.E problem going away. But, it didn’t fix it completely. 

What really changed the game for me was drinking coffee. I drink 20 ounces of iced coffee every day and it is the only reason I can eat and function like a normal person. Coffee plus protein seriously helps.

However, today I realize that coffee is  truly the biggest factor in why my binge eating has been under control lately. Today I ate a little less protein than I normally - which possibly could’ve made me more hungry, but, not to this extent.   I’ve probably consumed around 4000 cal. I usually eat 1400 or 1500 on a day when I’m feeling more hungry. That always leaves me feeling satisfied and I have no issues.

I did start weightlifting, however, I do that almost every day and I have no issues with this. But then it hit me, I didn’t drink any coffee today. That is the difference. I did not drink any coffee so my binging was just completely out of control. It’s like I was moving on auto pilot and that hasn’t happened to me in maybe two months? (I think I started seriously, weightlifting and drinking coffee around the same time.)

Just a note, I did not like coffee growing up, so I never drink it. Not even the coffee drinks that are pretty much all syrup and milk. However, I saw a recipe for this coffee drink on YouTube and I felt like it was a longshot, but I wanted to try it anyways and that’s really what did it for me. 

That is when I realize that it serves as an appetite suppressant. I know that for some people it makes them more hungry, or for some people it keeps them good and they binge afterwards. But for me, it just completely suppresses it.

I was just wondering if this is the case for anyone else? I think it’s kind of sad that this is the only way I can stop my binging. It’s sad that my binge eating will probably never stop because of “ willpower. “ However, I suppose coffee isn’t the worst thing in the world.  

I don’t put a lot of extra stuff in my coffee. 20 ounces of dark roast black coffee (cold - this is important) 2 teaspoons of dark brown sugar, 2 teaspoons of dark organic hot chocolate mix, and ice.",3,1731211193.0,BingeEatingDisorder,1,1.0,False

For context. I first visited this part of the world in 2013 on the stereotypical SE Asia backpacking tour. I visited Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia and knew I'd be back in Thailand one day. I still think I'll eventually retire here, although I'm only 34 now so that's a while away yet. 

After a year of working in a traditional corporate job in my country, I pivoted to become self-employed. This allowed me to live for a total of about 18 months in Chiang Mai from 2016-2019, where I had a girlfriend. 

Then I explored Bangkok for a month before Covid hit and I really liked it. Ever since the restrictions eased in 2022, I've found myself coming back to Bangkok several times each year for 4-8 weeks at a time. 

During my visits to Bangkok, I sometimes go to Vietnam or explore a new place in Thailand for a few days, but it's mostly like Bangkok is a second home base for me. I spend my days here living something approximating a normal routine like back home only in a surrounding that I feel more alive in. I visit interesting cafes and work for a few hours, I eat delicious food, I exercise, and I read. Sometimes I'll go check out a new part of the city or new restaurant. I get foot massages and Thai massages several times per week.  

But when I contemplate the size of the world, or even just the size of this part of the world it's like I'm sacrificing a lot just to travel to where I feel comfortable and content. I love the food in Bangkok (and Thailand in general), I can train muay Thai cheaply, the coffee is amazing, massages are a God send for someone who spends hours per day working on a laptop. 

I don't have tons of friends here, but I've made some really interesting transient connections over a few beers. Dating-wise, I'm not that into one-night stands so I tend to be in relationships here. 

But by never seeing places like the Philippines, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Japan I feel like the average person on a 6-month gap year experiences more novelty than I have in years of travel. Often when I bump into people passing through Bangkok I'm staggered at the number of countries they've visited in their lives  and I compare myself to that. I am starting to wonder if I'm wasting what is  clearly a privileged position to be able to travel this much.

This post is pretty long, so grab your favorite camp coffee and settle in! ☕

# Why I'm Writing This 📝

After seeing the millionth ""which sleeping bag should I buy?"" post, I figured I'd share everything I've learned from my mistakes and victories on the trail. Plus, my partner says I need to stop boring them with sleeping bag facts at dinner. 😅

# Understanding Compressibility: The Game Changer 🎒

Let me tell you a story. My first backpacking trip was a disaster. I showed up with my grandfather's old army surplus sleeping bag that was basically the size of a small car when packed. My more experienced friends politely didn't say anything, but their eyes said it all. That trip changed everything - I've been obsessed with gear optimization ever since.

# The Science Behind Compression 🔬

Here's a detailed breakdown of what affects compressibility:

|Factor|Impact on Compression|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Fill Power (Down)|Higher = Better|800+ is premium|
|Insulation Type|Down > Synthetic|Significant difference|
|Shell Material|Thinner = Better|Must balance with durability|
|Construction|Baffled > Sewn-through|Affects warmth too|
|Price Range|Higher = Usually Better|But not always!|

# The Great Insulation Debate: Down vs. Synthetic 🤔

# Down Bags: The Compression Champions

* **Pros:**
   * Compresses incredibly small
   * Lightweight
   * Lasts longer (10-15 years)
   * Better warmth-to-weight ratio
* **Cons:**
   * Expensive
   * Requires careful maintenance
   * Performance suffers when wet
   * Ethical concerns (though many brands now use responsibly sourced down)

# Synthetic Bags: The Reliable Workhorses

* **Pros:**
   * More affordable
   * Performs well when wet
   * Easier to clean
   * Good for allergy sufferers
* **Cons:**
   * Bulkier
   * Heavier
   * Shorter lifespan (3-5 years)
   * Less compressible

# Real-World Testing Results 📊

I've personally tested over 20 sleeping bags in the last decade. Here's my data:

|Bag Type|Average Packed Size|Weight|Comfort Rating|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Premium Down|6-7L|1.5-2 lbs|Excellent|
|Mid-Range Down|8-9L|2-2.5 lbs|Very Good|
|Premium Synthetic|10-12L|2.5-3 lbs|Good|
|Budget Synthetic|13-15L|3-4 lbs|Fair|

# Epic Trail Stories and Lessons Learned 🌲

*The Wet Disaster of 2019:* Picture this - three days into a week-long trek in the Pacific Northwest (because of course it was the PNW), my untreated down bag got soaked. I spent two miserable nights shivering before hiking out early. Lesson learned: either get hydrophobic down or bring serious waterproofing measures!

*The Compression Revelation:* Last summer, I did the same trail twice - once with my old synthetic bag and once with my new 850-fill down bag. The difference in pack space saved me 11L of volume. That meant I could bring a proper camp chair instead of sitting on logs like a savage. 🪑

# Top Recommendations Based on Experience 🏆

# God-Tier Compression (Price No Object)

1. **Feathered Friends Swallow UL 20**
   * Compressed size: 7L
   * Weight: 1lb 15oz
   * *Personal experience:* Worth every penny. This thing compresses to the size of a Nalgene bottle!

# Excellent Mid-Range Option

2. **Nemo Disco 15**

* Compressed size: 9.2L
* Weight: 2lb 11oz
* *Personal experience:* The spoon shape is amazing for side sleepers

# Best Budget Option

3. **Kelty Cosmic Down 20**

* Compressed size: 11L
* Weight: 2lb 15oz
* *Personal experience:* The gateway drug to down bags

# Temperature Ratings Decoded ❄️

*Pro Tip:* The EN/ISO ratings can be confusing. Here's what they really mean:

|Rating Type|What It Actually Means|
|:-|:-|
|Comfort|Women's comfortable temp|
|Lower Limit|Men's comfort limit|
|Extreme|Survival only - don't trust it!|

# Expert Compression Tips 💡

After hundreds of nights outdoors, here are my top tips:

1. **The Perfect Stuffing Technique**
   * Start from the foot
   * Push, don't fold
   * Use your knee for final compression
   * *Never* store compressed at home
2. **Compression Sack Selection**
   * Use waterproof sacks for down bags
   * Size down one size from recommended
   * Roll-top > Cinch-top

# Real Talk About Costs 💰

*Investment Analysis:*

* Budget Down: $200-300
* Mid-Range: $300-500
* Premium: $500+

*My take:* If you're serious about backpacking, invest in the best you can afford. I spent $600 on my current bag five years ago - that's $120/year for significantly better sleep and pack organization.

# Care and Maintenance 🧼

*The Secret to Longevity:*

1. Never store compressed
2. Wash 1-2 times per year
3. Use appropriate cleaning products
4. Always dry completely

# The Future of Compression Technology 🚀

Exciting developments I'm watching:

* Graphene-enhanced down
* New synthetic materials approaching down performance
* Hybrid insulation systems

# Final Thoughts and Recommendations 💭

After 15 years and thousands of trail miles, here's what I've learned:

* Compression matters more than you think
* Down is worth the investment for serious backpackers
* Never skimp on sleep system
* Buy once, cry once

*The Best Advice I Can Give:* Don't make the same mistakes I did. Start with a quality down bag if you can afford it. Your back (and pack) will thank you.

1gnrxp9,https://i.redd.it/o7yjlpf3yzzd1.jpeg,The Girl Who Gifted Camels,"Link - https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/s/7bVjNc8mbR 


In the city of New Delhi, there was a girl named Luna, quiet and withdrawn, who walked through the bustling streets carrying a set of tiny, intricately carved camel figurines. Four in total—two large, two small—each painted in desert tones with gleaming eyes that caught the light in unsettling ways. No one knew where Luna came from, but she appeared in the city as if out of nowhere, choosing random people as the targets of her strange gifts.

One day, she stopped by a coffee shop and approached a young man named Elias. He was a kind soul, the type who spent more time in his head than out, dreaming of romance but never quite finding it. When Luna approached him, she smiled sweetly and held out the camels.

""Here,"" she whispered. ""A gift. It’s for luck.""

Elias hesitated but accepted the set, charmed by her mysterious presence. As he held the figures, he felt a chill crawl over his skin, the air thickening with a quiet, unnatural energy. He could've sworn he heard a voice—a woman’s voice, low and tempting, laughing just under his breath.

That night, Elias dreamed of her: an otherworldly figure draped in shadow and flame, eyes glowing with an insatiable hunger. She whispered to him of love—of a passion so deep it would consume him. She showed him visions of Clara, a woman from his office he’d admired from afar but had never dared to approach.

“You love her, don’t you?” the voice teased, filling his heart with longing he couldn’t resist. “If only she knew...”

Elias awoke drenched in sweat, the camels on his nightstand gleaming in the moonlight. The next day, he couldn’t resist. He wrote Clara a message, pouring out his feelings, convinced now that she was his destiny. But Clara, a reserved, cool woman, responded politely, brushing off his confession. She didn’t feel the same, she told him, and preferred to keep their relationship professional.

Elias’s heart sank. Yet, the voice in his head urged him on, whispering sweet promises, feeding his obsession. Night after night, the succubus appeared in his dreams, her fingers like fire, her touch a brand on his soul. With each visit, his longing for Clara grew, as did the despair in his heart as she continued to ignore his affections. Weeks passed, and Elias felt his spirit weakening, his body becoming a shell of its former self.

Around Delhi, more and more people began to disappear. Luna gifted her camels one by one to unsuspecting souls—a woman who fell for a married man, a young artist who pined for a client, an old man whose long-lost love had passed away years before. Each of them clung to their unrequited love with ferocious desperation, wasting away until they simply faded, hearts broken, their souls fed to the darkness of the demon who visited them each night.

And then, just as mysteriously as she had arrived, Luna disappeared, her mission complete. New Delhi went back to normal, though whispers remained about the girl with the cursed camels. They say that if you listen closely in the dead of night, you might still hear the faint laughter of the succubus and the echoes of those who loved in vain, trapped in a haunting, eternal yearning.

As for romance—let’s just say, I’m a sucker for the whole princess treatment, but I also love to spoil and pamper my partner with affection and attention. If we vibe, let’s make it a fun, romantic adventure.

I’m 5’5”, plus-sized, with short curly hair, and I have a soft spot for dresses and overalls (yes, both). I’m all about trying new things—next up on my list is an intro to birding class. So, if you’re mature, self-aware, transparent, and can match my wit and creativity, I’d love to hear from you.

Bonus points if you enjoy long phone calls—I’m a fan of connecting that way before we go for a video chat.

Looking forward to seeing where this adventure takes us!

Not only are they in the fungi kingdom, which is mostly comprised of mushrooms, Doom-Shroom are an average of 4”07’ tall and 314 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able to destroy roofs, grass or lilypads, and with their impressive Base Stats for DMG and access to 'Doom Mode', you cannot be rough with one. Due to their mostly atomic based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that an furious Doom-Shroom would be incredibly bad, so bad that you could easily die, They can also learn the moves Destroy Everything, Red Eyes, Nuclear Fision, and Fungi Cloud, along with not having fur to hide scars, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to scare you. With their abilities Annihilation and Fatality they can easily extinguish zombies, animals and plants. No other plant comes close to this level of power.

Pretend to care about sports on TV. Shower. Go to bed. Do it all over again the next day.

Took me circa 38 years to realize just how exhausting existence is. Even making a sandwich for lunch seems like a burden now.

And the weekend days aren't really any less exhausting: more chores, 'keeping up with the jones' lifestyle, etc etc.

I even realized that pretending to care, or even pretending like I know what I'm doing, is exhausting.

Takeaways: 

* Quitting coffee gives me a host of benefits, including a huge reduction in my anxiety symptoms.  Over the last few years I have had panic attacks and anxiety while driving (usually at least 1x/month or more) and this has not occurred since I quit. 
* More patience and calm (good especially for these times)
* Easier to get up in the morning - I don't feel like I just got hit by a 2x4 until I've had coffee
* Made it easier to curb my sugar intake because I notice that I am less likely to submit to sugar cravings when I'm not drinking coffee. 
* I live in the US and in the event that Trump starts putting tariffs on imported goods, it's nice to know I'm not reliant on caffeine/coffee beans, and won't need to buy coffee making equipment.

* Quitting coffee has not completely cured my insomnia and sleep issues, and so I'm trying to work on better sleep hygiene and other techniques.

1gnrege,https://i.redd.it/z7gudo3pszzd1.jpeg,"Apollo making himself known? What do I do now? TLDR: got 3 clear signs, what do now?","So I’ve been coming across a lot of videos on my fyp on tiktok talking about Apollo. I haven’t practiced witchcraft/spirituality in a few years but it’s still something I find very fascinating. I’ve learned a bit about a few gods from different pantheons in the past, but never Apollo. But all the extra talk about him lately got me digging to see what he’s about and I realized there’s a lot of things in my life that align with him. I’m a Leo, I played violin most of my life and have dabbled in a few other instruments and I was also in a few choirs growing up, I’ve been diligent to find and express truth my entire life, I paint and crochet, I’m a barber and specialized in shaved designs for a while. I’ve also seen something’s about him connecting with people who had an absent mother and narcissistic step parents and both are the case for me. Another weird thing that happened is that even though I am a pretty healthy person, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was 28 and a few months after that I had cicadas popping up all over my house and shedding their exoskeletons all summer. 

So fast forward to last night after I had seen all those videos, while I was praying as I was falling asleep I was basically like “yo apollo, if you’re with me you’ll make yourself known before midnight tomorrow with 3 or more signs of yourself. It can’t be on tiktok or anything I’m in control of. You can’t play something over my playlist, you can’t do anything while I’m scrolling, or with anything I choose to watch. You have to pop up in real life and it can be through something im actively in control of. 

So then this morning while I was driving to work I had seen a semi truck with a giant yellow smiley face on the back of it and it said “have a great day”. I took that as the first sign. 

Then at work, my coworker that controls the music of the barbershop stepped out to go grab coffee and he left his playlist on shuffle. While he was out and I was in the middle of a haircut, the song “walking on the sun” by smash mouth came on. I took that as the second sign.

Since that point up until about an hour ago I didn’t get another sign. It was like 9pm and I just figured I wasn’t going to get another sign so I was just chilling with my boyfriend just scrolling through tiktok and my boyfriend was flipping through stuff to put on tv. A video about Apollo popped up on my fyp again and I said in my head that TikTok doesn’t count. Not even a second after I said that in my head, my boyfriend put on a cat video for our cats to see what they would do and it was a bunch of mice on the screen with a bright yellow background. It was extra weird because he’s literally never done that, at least not since we’ve been dating. So I took that as the third sign. 

So like, what do I do now? Do I have to do anything? I just feel like it was all creepily clear. Should I just like start doing some reading to learn more about him? And even with that, where do I start? Halp.",1,1731208835.0,Hellenism,1,1.0,False

Anyway, I got a bad bad case of pneumonia about a month ago. The worst sickness I’ve ever had in my life. My covid experience is nothing compared to this. 

Unfortunately, I was misdiagnosed by a doctor the first week, and given an antibiotic that it was resistant to, so it had only developed worse. I received correct antibiotics about two weeks into the illness. Lung xray was bad. 

I just had my follow up, lungs look much better but there is still some residual gunk, at even a month and seven days later, and still a lingering dry cough.

The cabin fever has been real, I felt good today and decided to go on a strenuous hike. This was an awful idea, and it hadn’t really hit me until I was halfway through 5 of 10 miles when the incline started. 

I could not catch a breath. My heart was beating out of my chest and the cough began.
Out of no where, I just couldn’t breathe at all. It felt like trying to suck air through a coffee stir while under water. I looked at my boyfriend and could barely mouth the words, “I can’t breathe”, my hands went numb and eventually he got me regulated and I was able to breathe again. This was the scariest thing I’ve ever experienced. 

I am uncertain if this was a panic attack (I was very anxious the entire hike due to how physically limited I felt, I was so over it and wanted to be done) or was this an attack? I have no experience with asthma. I was prescribed an inhaler at the peak of my sickness, if necessary. I feel inclined to carry it with me now.

We moved our convo to WhatsApp and then couple weeks later he asks me out and then we went on a coffee date. We hung out for about 3 hours and the date was great. Throughout talking to him he was very open (even shared about his family stuff), and we talked about so many different things. I felt such a connection to him…he would remember little things I mentioned and asked me lots of questions about me. It felt like he wanted to genuinely get to know me, not like I was being interviewed. He would even joke around that he can cook while I clean up because I hate cooking and don’t mind the cleaning! I guess that’s typical Pisces love bombing?
After the date he sends me a song he mentioned on the date. We kept messaging…and I was confused as to why he didn’t mention the date or say he enjoyed his time with me. So a day after the date I let him know I enjoyed spending time with him and would like to see him again.
He responds that he enjoyed it as well and then mentions he likes to take things slow and “We will for sure meet again”. 
Would have been nice if he was direct and said “I would like to see you again. Let’s set something up!”. 
So we continue talking for a week after the date….still he doesn’t mention seeing me again. 
Then today I just straight up told him I feel all we’ve been doing is texting and I’m not really sure where this is headed. I wasn’t pressuring him and told him I understand he likes to take things slow, and I’m the same, but just want to know if he actually wants to see me again or where this is headed.
Sent this around 8 am….and he hasn’t responded (it’s not 8 pm). He’s usually slow to respond (typical Pisces). So I didn’t think too much and kept waiting. Then I called him, and messaged him saying I hope he didn’t take things the wrong way and asked if everything’s good.
I really do like him and felt a deep connection to him! We just had so many things in common and he was genuinely caring and a nice guy….

Am I overthinking? Does he need space? Or was he just not that interested in the first place and just looking for someone to pass time with?

1gnr5al,https://i.redd.it/6ukgqv55qzzd1.jpeg,Black Butte vs Dark Sarcasm,"Just did a blind taste test. Honestly can’t pick a winner, they both have very strong points.


Black butte has a richer, thicker head and nicer color imo. DS was a little flat on the pour and appears (visually) less complex.


Black butte has a creamier immediate taste, silky like regular porters, but finishes a bit lackluster. DS on the otherhand is a touch abrasive up front and seems like it’s going to be watery, but it quickly shows an unexpected complexity as it settles on your tongue, with rich notes of coffee and chocolate.


In short, BB looks better and has a more pleasing consistency, while DS is more complex with bolder flavors on the whole. Both are 10/10 in my book 👌",9,1731207976.0,NABEER,3,1.0,False

It tends to get worse in the cold. Has anyone else had this issue and found any solutions?

For some background, here’s my skincare routine:

Morning:
	•	Pure hyaluronic acid serum
	•	Klairs moisturizer and SPF 50

Night:
	•	I used to use Paula’s Choice exfoliator but stopped to avoid further irritation. Now, I just use Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence and a moisturizer before bed.

I drink a lot of coffee but am considering cutting back, as it might be contributing to the issue. I also drink plenty of water and am a fitness enthusiast—I run 3.11 miles a day and go to the gym six days a week.

Since starting corporate life, my diet has taken a hit with all the networking events, snacks everywhere, and social drinking (mainly wine and sake). I’ve gained about 10 pounds in the process and am now trying to make healthier choices.

Any advice on managing the skin issue would be greatly appreciated!”",1,1731207962.0,Skincare_Addiction,1,1.0,False

1gnr2wl,https://i.redd.it/ktlmm22hpzzd1.jpeg,How hard are pour overs?,"So here’s the story. This summer I ended up on James Hoffmann’s YouTube channel, and like many of you, I assume, go dragged down the rabbit hole of coffee making. 

At first I was using a cheap drip coffee maker, but with freshly roasted beans from driftaway. I was buying them pre ground and was making pretty decent coffee. I then bought a hand grinder (timemore c2) and started buying whole beans from different sources. Throughout that period, I was discovering that coffee could taste so much more than I was used to, and started to develop my palette a bit. 

Then came the Hario v60. I was intrigued by what I was seeing online and wanted to give it a try. It’s now been 6 months and I am feeling kind of lost. I have been experimenting with different recipes, beans, brewing temperature. I sometimes feel like I am getting a pretty good cup of coffee compared to what I’m tasting at specialty shops, but can never recreate the experience the next day. I am having a horrible time with consistency, and dialing in new coffees. I know that anything in life has a learning curve, and that it may be a long adventures, but here’s my question to all of you: 

How long did it take you to get consistent and good results with pour overs? 

I am also contemplating buying an aeropress because I read that it was a great way to get a consistent cup. That way, I could experiment with different variables such as temperatures and grind sizes, and learn to taste the effects they have on the taste of my coffee cups.

My wife has what I believe is undiagnosed depression despite my asking her to get help.  It has turned our relationship into something that feels more like a roommate situation than a marriage. The emotional connection is gone, and there’s no intimacy anymore.  I can’t remember last time we had a meaningful conversation.

I love my kids, and I want the best for them, but I’m struggling. I feel completely alone in this marriage.  I’m desperate for affection, intimacy, and a deeper connection, but I don’t know how to find that without risking my family falling apart. The idea of breaking up for their home makes me sick.

I’m also overwhelmed by the reality that I might be stuck in this situation for another 10+ years until my kids are grown, but I don’t know how to keep going with this level of emotional dissatisfaction for that long.

Today may have been the straw that broke the camel's back.  We planned all week that we were going to repaint my son's room and he was excited about it.  6am I wake up with kids while she sleeps.  I make breakfast, do 2 loads of laundry, clean the bathroom, while juggling 2 kids and she's still not out of bed.  

Alright, I guess she's not getting out of bed today... I take both kids to Home Depot, buy spackle, paint, rollers, come home, and start moving the furniture out of my son's room, when she finally rolls out of bed around 11am. 

She's pissed we didn't wait for her to get started, whatever.  I ask her to watch the youngest so we can get started painting, but first she has to go to DK for coffee.  She gets back close to noon, then I have to make everyone lunch. Everyone finishes eating lunch around 1230pm, then I ask again if she can watch the youngest so we can paint my son's room like we promised we would all week, but before she can do anything, she first has to drink her coffee, which consists of her slowly sipping it while scrolling her phone for an hour.  

Now it's 130pm, and we still haven't gotten started.  Then she remembers she needs to go to Walmart for some stuff but can't take any kids with her.  It's 3pm by the time she gets back and still no painting and it's getting too late in the day to start.  We're gonna try again tomorrow, but my son was so upset, and this all could have been voided if she wasn't so lazy and unmotivated.

Put 4k into a 6 month TD thinking I was doing the smart grown up thing.
Of course I only just realised in my naivety that I had not placed the minimum funds of $5k into a term deposit to get the benefit of the full rate. In fact it turns out that the rate on my 'investment' was only 0.50%.
My questions are as follows:
Why does that rate exist at all? Why let someone dumb like me make that sort of error?

Also. I assume I would've made  more interest by just leaving that money in the on-call account (over 6 months)?

And that really. I'm only actually going to get a better rate of return by leaving it in for a full 12 months?

Sorry if this seems simple and more like an existential crisis.
But I'm just trying to understand what to do better in the future.

I'm annoyed at myself but also that the system let me make this clearly dumb mistake.

Going to enjoy an $8 cup of coffee with my 'return'.

I also only just realised I had my savings in my not-savings account. Accruing no interest at all. For like ... 4 years. Has been between 5 and 15k in that time.

For starters, I am a Muslim gal, so I would only pursue a relationship with another Muslim or someone who is interested in the religion. I don’t want any super strict or judgy partner though. I don’t wear a scarf so if that’s not okay then you can check out now lol. 
 

I don’t drink, do drugs, or party and I would prefer someone who lives a similar “boring” lifestyle lol 

I am a nerdy nerd. I still love Harry Potter and Disney movies and any sort of media that strikes joy in me or provides comfort escapism no matter how cringe that may seem at my age. 

Other things I like: to read, write, hike, travellll, coffee/tea, going to the movies or the mall to window shop. 

I would also prefer someone who is introverted but still likes to go out and about. I am not a homebody by any means, I just don’t hang out with many people outside of family, so I spend a lot of movie dates, shopping trips, or hikes alone.

My final ask (I know this is a long post I’m sorry 😭) someone who is ambitious and financially independent. I’ve always worked on making sure myself and my family are taken care of and I want a partnership, not someone who will heavily rely on me.

1gnqvcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1gnqvcj/trying_to_find_and_adapter_to_power_my_chinese/,Trying to find and adapter to power my Chinese coffee roaster in N. America,"Hello. I recently got a coffee roaster from China. It is a 220V appliance.  I thought I would be able to power it with a 220v step up adapter but it requires 3000w of power so my outlet still cannot power it with that. I have access to a 240v dryer socket which has ( I  believe) a NEMA 14-30 socket (it has 4 prongs)

I believe the appliance uses a NEMA 6-15P plug (it has 3 prongs in kind of a triangular pattern). I have tried to find an adapter but the ones I've got are too big for the 3 prong plug.

  
is it even safe to try to plug it in the 4 prong 240V outlet and can someone point me to an adapter that will actually fit for this purpose if so?

Since it was not a cheap appliance I would like to be able to make use of it if possible without needing to install a whole new socket.



thanks

1gnqv0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1gnqv0p/it_hit_me_like_a_truck_today/,It hit me like a truck today,"(No real trigger Warning, just wasn't sure what flair to use.)

I was having a difficult morning, and usually when this happens I walk to the coffee shop near my work during the sunrise. I've made this whole little process to help keep myself regulated emotionally. Well today... when I was walking across the parking lot, I looked over to my right and there was a car parked out in front of the store next to my work. There were two people inside making out heavily, I saw the woman's bright blonde hair and.. I had the most violent physical reaction I've had since Dday 1. 

My stomach didn't just drop immediately, i was nauseous within seconds. Over salivating and beginning to dry heave. I ducked behind the nearby dumpster and vomited. Everything was spinning. I couldn't catch my breathe. I just started sobbing uncontrollably. I had no idea who these people were but in that instant, I saw my WP and his AP in that car. Is that what they looked like when they were tongue kissing in the parking lot of Starbucks? All wrapped up in a neat little bow...

You see, this was apparently his Christmas gift from her. Like making out with her was so special it had to be the present itself.. for Christmas. You know.. his favorite holiday.. where he's supposed to wake up and spend the day with me and our children and have the whole sappy lifetime movie moment. Except I didn't get that. He didn't even get me anything for Christmas last year.. kept claiming he didn't know what to get but I saw the screen shots of things he was looking to buy her. A pink brand name beanie. Starbucks cups. Electric hand warmers... but apparently no idea what to get me. The person he shared a bed with every night for the last 10 years. The person who was 8 months pregnant with his 4th child. The person who has shared every interest, hobby and budding obsession but still he somehow didn't know what to look for. 

I don't know how I'm going to get through December. I don't want to acknowledge it. I don't want to go through it. I don't want to celebrate it... but I have to. I can't tell my children that we aren't having Christmas or my oldest's birthday this year because mom's a traumatized fucking mess and she'd rather jump off a bridge. 

He went shopping with her for our daughter's birthday last year... even though he knew I wanted to go with him and it should have been a moment where WE shop for OUR child. Instead it became a cute shopping date for them where he took pictures of her in a hat that he ended up buying for our daughter.. to make it worse, he tried to recreate the cute moment he had with her.. with ME. By putting the hat on me when he got home from the store, and waving me off saying we could go shopping together later and to not make a big deal of it.. even though he bought more than enough. I knew this was just lip service.. And just like I thought, he never took me out to buy anything together. He gave my moments to someone else. Moments I can't get back. Which is something he knows is massively triggering for me due to previous trauma about 6 years back. To add insult to injury, on Dday when i found his snapchat, when I was scrolling through their messages.. I saw he sent her the pictures he took of her that day wearing that hat, following a cute little ""love you, hoe. ❤️"" and a ""you're too fucking cute."" 

This stupid fucking bitch haunts my every waking moment and I'm so sick of it. I can't even accept compliments from my WP or be any kind of intimate with him without her pictures popping up in my head. He will say something along the lines of being sexy or my ass being big and I have to stop myself from saying that I've seen what he considers big or sexy and I definitely don't look like any of those women. His AP was 100% his type from her hair color to body type to personality to.. everything. She checked all the fucking boxes. I'm smaller than her, in all the ways that mattered. So just him calling my ass big sends me into a fucking spiral because my brain screams it's not big compared to hers. My body is nothing compared to hers. I'm so fucking uncomfortable just being perceived and I hate it. 

I've had identity issues my whole life and I thought I was finally on track towards building a me that I was proud of. A large part of that identity was centered around him and our family.. and now I'm sitting in the shattered remains of who I used to be trying to piece things together and none of it makes sense. I don't know who I am, and if the me that I was building was so unimportant that she was discarded habitually then who the fuck am I supposed to be. I have never been good enough. For anyone. Why am I going to keep trying to build a Me if it doesn't matter in the end? My detached and dissociated self seems to work fine most days so maybe it's just better this way? 

I'm sorry this is all over the place, I haven't been able to settle down all day. That panic attack really fucked me up and I'm attempting to navigate this the best I can. It just keeps hitting me throughout the day.. and all I can see is them together. Like damage is coming at me from all sides and I can hardly mitigate it anymore. Just a constant barrage of her pictures and their messages that I'm trying to ignore.

 Thank you for hanging in this long, and listening to my struggles. I'm hoping the panic will subside by the time I wake up, but I'm not gonna hold my breathe. Each day is a new kick in the ass..

Take care, everyone. ",12,1731207021.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,5,1.0,False

I am looking for suggestions on where to travel to an area for a few weekdays with my wife, baby and I.

I’m on leave this month and my wife works remotely. We are looking for something small to get away from Madison for a bit. She would be working remotely at a coffee shop or local hang during the day and I would be caretaking either nearby or on small hikes, read and just enjoy time together.

The places we came up with were: Door County, Eau Claire, and Oneida County. (We are familiar with all of these)

Are there any hidden gems you would suggest that has a good amount of walking/hiking and good cozy coffee shops within a few hours + of Madison?

Some places I think might be worth visiting: Galena,
Dubuque, and Marquette, MI (long drive though).

One such pleasure is the ritual of savoring a warm cup of coffee. As the rich aroma fills the air, it invites a moment of pause, a chance to escape the hustle and bustle of the week.

Paired with this comforting beverage, a timepiece like the Longines chronograph adds a touch of elegance and precision to the experience. Its sleek design and intricate mechanics are a testament to the brand's rich heritage in watchmaking. As the watch ticks away, it becomes a silent companion, marking the passage of time with each deliberate movement of its hands.

The contrast between the warmth of the coffee and the cool, metallic feel of the watch creates a sensory experience that is both soothing and invigorating. It's in these quiet moments, surrounded by the simplicity of a well-made cup of coffee and a finely crafted timepiece, that one can truly appreciate the finer things in life.

* My wife prefers iced drinks. 
* I prefer iced drinks at times, and am okay to drink iced if I get a proper espresso drink earlier in the day

I've done some research and am considering the following:
* Rancillo Silvio w/ PED, which is $1249 at SCG
* Ascaso Steel Uno, $1595 at SCG

Any arguments for or against one of these options? 

Is it worth to go for the new Silvio Pro X ($1990) or Steel Duo ($1895)? (Or something else in that price range?)

* How much more value would i get from a pressure gauge (considering l'm a newb, but fast learner)?
* Is there another reason I’m unaware of to step up to a machine in this price range?

For the grinder, I am leaning towards the Df64.

*edited to add correct spacing 

This will be long but it needs to be. I believe that God has given me my voice and my strength back to boldly share my story. This post is for those who believe there are two sides to every story. I'm here to share my side, because I know you have heard the other. I will not tolerate the hateful, nasty, narrative of “there are 2 sides to every story”. This is to inform everyone reading these posts, including those who are still in the Network, because I know you’re there. Do not attempt to minimize, undermine, or distort the abuse I endured within the Network and beyond. My experiences are real and valid, and any attempt to diminish or dismiss them is unacceptable, and will not be tolerated. 


I am fully aware that the Network/Vine/North Pines have shared their narratives because it has gotten back to me. It’s my turn to share my side. 


For years, I have contemplated walking away from all of this. Infact, I had walked away. I deleted most of my social media, unfollowed this Reddit page, stopped praying, stopped wondering what I had done wrong. 


I have been wrestling with whether or not to share the things I’m about to. I have shared briefly about my time at North Pines and Vine, but not until I started professional therapy did I realize that my story should be shared to those who still attend the Network, those who left, and to families who are wondering what their family members have gotten into. 


Everyone blames my husband and I for blowing things up in the network. Some have even given me the credit for starting LTN, which thanks, I’m honored, but it was not me. I am going to share the examples that have been used and twisted to further benefit the Network’s narrative, specifically calling out pastor’s, churches, and my specific abuse brought on by Nick Sellers, lead pastor at North Pines Church in Kalamazoo, MI.


As you read these examples, I beg you to show me how these conversations and these experiences were Biblical. 


September 2016: Our small groups had just started, and I was attending one of the only college student ones. It was exciting and fun. There was one particular small group member who seemed to not catch onto social cues, who during one week, had walked out of the bathroom, and asked the group for a tampon. To which she was directed upstairs. I hadn’t thought anything negative about this interaction, as periods are a normal part of being a girl. However, the following Sunday, Nick approached me and said something similar to “Hey, I heard what happened at small group this week, can you ask her to not come back? Just say she’s not ready for church or something” The way he was talking to me, he was towering over me, as if to intimidate me. I immediately responded with No. He continued to convince me to tell her that she was not a good fit, or ready for church yet. When I pushed back with “where will she learn to be ready? Where will she learn about God?” Nick stared at me, and told me to do it anyway. I refused and walked away. 

Mid November 2016: My now husband and I were church planted for North Pines. We fell in love while there, and attempted to talk to Nick about our feelings. My husband was met wit hostility and called demonic for simply kissing me in my car. When I met with Nick in the library on WMU’s campus, I came forward and told him about how we had kissed in my car. We kept all of our clothes on, we did not have sex, not that it’s anyone’s business, but just to clear the air, we didn’t have sex before marriage like some of the stories say. I was fully transparent with Nick, as we were trained to do with our pastors. He responded with “YOU DID WHAT?! I am so so so angry and disgusted with you two” This was all taking place in a very public library, with witnesses. The conversation continued with me saying “We hung out, and it led to us kissing, that was it, I’m not some kind of monster!” Once I had finished telling my side of the story, He asked if my husband had groped my breasts, if I had touched his penis or not, if he had put his hands down my pants over or under my panties. He demanded that I tell him the entire experience over and over again “to get it right”, while I continued to sit and sob uncontrollably in a room full of strangers. He continued to ask about my body, and my husband's body. He continued with his berating of me and said “I have never been so angry at two people as I am right now. Look what you’ve done. All I want to do right now is line you up on a brick wall and spank you both like you’re children.” I should have, and could have gone to the police over a grown man telling a 19 year old female that he wanted to be physically violent with her.  
In that same conversation, Nick proceeded to ask me if I understood the consequences of falling into temptation (of a kiss, not sex remember). I was confused, so he continued with “people like you will likely have fertility issues. We’ve seen it time and time again. You may even be barren. Who knows if God will allow that for you, since, you know, fell into temptation with him.” Where in the Bible does it say that it’s OK for a pastor to say those words? He used his authority to speak ill things over me. Since then, I’ve been blessed with three beautiful babies. I thank God every day that Nick’s words did not come true. 
Continuing the same conversation, Nick tells me that I can not be in my current small group any longer. When I asked about how to tell others, Nick said “Well, it’s not great to lie, but how about you tell everyone your schedule changed so now you have to come to my group now? 
This was the end of 2016, my now husband and I felt as though we were ready to get married. We felt good and happy about our decision. Nick did not approve, he had other plans for my husband. These plans included for him to be on staff, and to not be with me. He assumed that I was pregnant (I was not) and that North Pines was no longer our home. We were banished back to Vine after 6 months of starting our new life in Kalamazoo. We did what we were told, and had hope for a family back at Vine. The small group we joined welcomed us with open arms and gave us the love we so desperately needed in that dark time. I still have a lot of love for that group, and I hope you are all safe and healing if you’re reading this. 


However, the love of that small group did not transcend into love within the church. Please continue to read our experiences. 

February 14th, 2017: We met up with Jackson, our DC pastor (and now a pastor at Christland). We wanted to process the hurt we had endured, however we were met with “I’ve heard what Nick had to say, I think things should have gone differently, and you should have gone about this differently. Trust is broken on our end.” I knew that my voice would not be heard. Jackson continued to tell me that my only serving capacity I was allowed in was janitorial. I was not allowed to work with children, work on the coffee team, or any other team. Janitorial was my only option. 

Summer 2017: I had also found out that a small group leader’s wife had been gossiping about me, and how she assumed that I was pregnant. Another girl, who is now currently a small group leader, was laughing with an entire group of college students about how “all I wanted to do was have a husband to have sex with”. So if you’re on here, just know that the people you talk your shit with, still throw you under the bus for all that you do too.

Early Fall 2017: When I approached another pastor (Mike Stephens, current pastor as Vine) about these issues, he barely gave me the time of day in that auditorium. He laughed at me and said “I know all of these people very very well, my wife loves some of them too. They can have their opinions and I think you should be more careful about what you do then.” I went to him in a Godly manner, approaching it in a way I believe Jesus would have wanted, but I was met with victim shaming instead. 


We stayed for a year at Vine before we felt called back to Kalamazoo. For lack of better words, it was a dumpster fire from the start. I’m sure there have been stories told about us where we haven’t been able to say our side, so here is our side of those stories. 

Fall 2018: The reason we didn’t go to the retreat that year was because my husband and I were not allowed to stay together, they (Nick and Will) wanted us separated. I was pregnant at the time, and because they wanted us separated, they were OK with me sleeping in my car rather than sleeping in the same room as my husband.

Spring 2019: Due to complications, I had to have a c-section with my first child. I was questioned and shamed for having a c-section. They told me it was demonic, that having a medical emergency was a sign of sin lingering, or that I must have been really struggling because I caved and had an epidural. Several moms in the Network told me that it was wrong of me to use modern medicine like that. What would they think if I told them I was on antidepressants (and thriving) now?

September 7th and 8th 2019: The situation ultimately reached a breaking point when my husband received a phone call from Will Miller, now staff pastor at North Pines. He informed my husband that they had enough of my disobedience, and will be setting clear boundaries with me going forward. I knew that I wasn’t loved or liked anymore, but that was because I was speaking up about things that I cared about, things like Nick’s abuse, the gossip, the delivery of my child, my body, and why the church wasn’t involved with our community, as well as why we were still instructed, by Nick, to as “not cleaned up” people to leave or not attend our church. I was bringing up things that I was sure Jesus cared about too. In the same phone call, Will had also told my husband that I was “the spirit of discontentment” and that I was “leaking out to others and causing all of the divide in the church and ultimately the downfall of the network”. He talked about my personality being “cancerous, like the West Nile virus”. My husband and I offered to reconcile with Nick and North Pines. We have text messages proving we were willing to meet and speak to North Pines about this. North Pines said no. Ultimately we had to leave. 


I’m aware that all of this is a lot to read and digest. I’m also sure that many in the network won’t read this anyways, but if you’re still there, thank you for getting this far. To those of you who are reading this, please know that these people I mentioned made me hate myself and made me contemplate taking my own life multiple times. They did that to me. They put so much doubt into my head that I thought I’d ever come back from it. I didn’t believe that I was worthy of God’s love or grace. I lost a lot from the years of abuse I endured, and the years after. 


I beg you to get out. I beg you to share my story with your family members who are in it, and help them get out. There are far better, healthier church communities out there who truly know how to love like Jesus.


I’m standing here today writing to all of you now because I’ve found healing. My husband has found healing. I’ve been working with a qualified mental health professional for the year, including the last three months of working with a trauma specialist, and I’ve never felt more free than I do now. I’m thriving, I have three beautiful children, an amazing husband, who despite being told to leave me multiple times by Nick Sellers, has chosen to love me and our beautiful life we’ve created. We are not suffering, like they told us we would. There is a way out.


If you haven’t figured it out yet, my name is Taylor Chromek. While I am positive my name will never be associated with positive thoughts throughout the network, I do know that my name is known across the network, so much for gossip being a sin, right? I’m sitting here sharing the truth to what happened to me, but these stories are not the only things that happened to me. These are truly just a small glimpse into the abuse I endured. The spiritual, the physical, the emotional, and the financial abuse that I endured at the hands of Nick Sellers, and the Network. I welcome respectful conversations regarding my journey in the Network, however I will not be defending myself to those who want to push back on me now. You had your chance years ago. 


I’m finally at a spot in my life where I will not be made to feel guilt or shame around my experiences. I am here, and I am a survivor of the abuse at the hands of the Network. 


Signed,


Taylor Chromek, Survivor

I am a 29Y old Female with a really gorgeous younger sister. She’s tall, fair and beautiful with really good facial features where as I am on the exact opposite end of the spectrum, she probably got the best of the gene pool where as the case was vice versa with me

I grew up as a really confident girl, I got a good amount of male attention too during my teens and I was never really compared to my sister ever. Infact, I always knew she’s really beautiful and I was really proud of this, I would even flex her pictures to others to show how beautiful my sister is. 

But during my early 20s , things started changing, I really got bashed for not being “beautiful” 

There were a couple of instances that started shattering my confidence

1. A guy who was trying to impress another friend of mine saw my father at an event and then told her , “her father is so good looking, why is she like this”. The girl in turn told me this in front of the whole group, I really was shattered because that particular day I felt like I was looking my best self

2. I met a guy at a date, the date went fine, he blocked me after going home. Later he messaged apologising to me after months saying he was shocked by how I looked in reality. 

3. I got married and after our engagement , one of my husbands aunt asked him why didn’t he choose the younger sister instead 

4. We met some friends for dinner recently with my sister and her partner. The friend literally said your sister is so beautiful, you both don’t look like you’re related by blood 

5. My husband once said, he is worried about having a daughter because she would be average looking and her self confidence would be less and he doesn’t want that for his daughter. He really loves himself , he is obsessed with himself and it’s so diffeent than me, so I am not sure if he was indicating at me de of things that happened. 

6. My husbands cousin met me recently over coffee and told me about how when my MIL was announcing our wedding in the family told them that I am not that beautiful but I am really smart with a good job and how highly qualified I am educationally. She then told me we saw your pictures and we couldn’t figure out why would aunty say that, you look cute 

It’s so weird growing up confident and then having your confidence get shattered with every passing day and suddenly I am not able to love myself, I don’t have the money to change my facial bone structure etc and get into that loop. I have a really really good job and I would say I am the most successful person in my family line. I am so confident on the outside and yet no one knows the storm inside, there are some days when all this doesn’t bother me but then again something like this happens and I can’t help thinking if ultimately nothing matters and it’s only the looks that matter, how unfair is life

2 weeks back, I was on a train ride home from work. Started randomly chatting to this fairly attractive woman on the train ( I was just in a chatty moo ) which isn't common for me to do. Trains was delayed so I offered her to join me in a Taxi and I'd drop her off, I asked for her number and we'd arrange lunch or coffee..... Few days go buy, She texts and we grab a Coffee. It went went well.... Last night we went out and did Axe Throwing and then went to this Cafe where they do board games. However, Had to cut it short because she's got vertigo and was feeling funny.

I find her very attractive & I'm honestly quite shocked how much I'm into her. I find her funny and very interesting and I'm kinda taken back but also kinda nervous because she's technically a stranger, Or was at least was one two weeks ago.

Anyway, My doubts have crept into my head because we arranged to meet for this coming Tuesday to do bowling and dinner. However, She texted if we could do Bowling ""The week after next"" because she's got a heavy work load and wants to shift this vertigo before doing any activity. So I agreed and suggested we go and watch Gladiator 2 next Friday, Something more chilled and relaxing.... And she agreed to a late showing on Froday night. She said she had a lovely night too aswell..... I think I'm kinda nervous because I'm just trying to figure this out..... Like, I THINK she's into me. I thought her pushing bowling by a week was her tryna get rid of me but she's agreed to go Cinema on Friday instead so she clearly still wants to see me.

I don't know.... I just want some advice on how to approach this. We don't really text in between dates ( We only been on two ) and she doesn't seem big on texting as her texts are very quick and short which is completely opposite to how she is in person, Always talking and engaging in conversation.

It's intimidating because she's older than me, She's a complete stranger and I've loved these first two dates and I kinda wanna know what she's thinking but I also don't wanna rush or Cock this up because I think she's awesome.

# Humans are Weird – Blood in the Water

**Original Post:** [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-blood-in-the-water](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-blood-in-the-water)

Quilx’tch was quite muzzy from sleep and stared down in perplexity at the water catch basin in front of him. He hiked up his comforter around him, blocking off the fuzzy view of the rest of the massive cleansing room provided for human use. The catch basin really should not be that color, he finally decided, feeling a bit proud of himself for forcing the thought up through layers of sleep deprivation. A stray thought thread suggested that he really should have petitioned the central university for this sector for that assistant when he had the chance, but the blood-berries had been blooming in the south slopes and none of the preservation techniques this base had access to would have preserved the protein structures quite right.

Quilx’tch brushed the pad of one paw over his primary eyes to dismiss the stray wisps of thought.

“I’m getting as bad as Human Friend Scotty,” he said ruefully.

Another stray thought tried to lead him down the path of wondering if human behavior contain was playing a role in his current state.

“It was not as if my University time showed much better behavior,” he clicked to himself idly.

Bloodberries. Yes, the humans called them that because their eyes showed the glittering orbs as a single color. They claimed it was the same color as their primary circulatory fluid. Now, Quilx’tch wondered why he was thinking of that as he stared down at the discolored catch basin.

The material for the catch basin had been harvested from the local rocks. Human Friend Scotty had eagerly explained the process.

“We used to have to carve things like this out of larger chunks of rock,” the human had said. “Now we just grind up the fragments til we get the size we want and then we micro-compress them into shape. Folks like it because it looks like rough granite, smooth with shiny bits inside”

Quilx’tch now stared at the shiny bits visible under the coating of fluid.

“I think,” Quilx’tch said to himself, feeling a bit uneasy. “The humans would also call that blood red.”

He pondered what the substance might be as he walked across the edge of the cold catch basin to gather up his grooming brush and chelicerae pick. He gently pushed the comforter back, letting the harsh cleansing room light sting his secondary eyes as he gently brushed out his hairs. He found his gaze repeated drawn back to the layer of bio-matter, or at least he thought it was bio-matter, in the catch basin. Usually Human Friend Scotty was quite careful about cleaning up after himself. So it might not be biomatter after all. Though Quilx’tch couldn’t imagine what Human Friend Scotty would have been doing this early in the morning in the cleansing room. His grooming finished he gathered up his comforter and trotted out to the main sleeping area, massive to his scale, but seeming quite filled by the mass of the human who was currently wriggling into his day clothes.

Quilx’tch scampered over the spider-walk along the wall and tucked his comforter back into his hammock while Human Friend Scotty arranged his protective outer layers against his hairless skin. That task seemingly complete the human reached down for his foot armor and proceed with a Trisk-check. Quilx’tch couldn’t help chuckling anew at that. Why the humans were, to a person, convinced that his kind liked to hide in there foot armor was a mystery, but one that provided far too much amusement on distant base to be probed into too abruptly. That final ceremony over Human Friend Scotty set his binocular vision sniping around the room to locate him.

Quilx’tch waved to catch the humans attention.

“Tiny spider friend on his bunk,” the human stated in the dim but satisfied tone of one fulfilling a checklist.

“Human Friend Scotty,” Quilx’tch interjected.

He knew that if he did not catch the human’s attention quickly at this time of day nothing would keep the human from bolting for the coffee that was brewing in the cafeteria once Human Friend Scotty had located him.

Now the human visible paused in his preparation to lumber out the door of their room.

“What’s up little guy?” the human asked, fighting back a yawn.

“Why is the catch basin in the cleansing room the color of bloodberries?” Quilx’tch asked.

Human Friend Scotty blinked slowly as he processed the question. Then his face flexed and his chin lifted with a grin as he clearly parsed the answer.

“I forgot to rinse out the sink after brushing my teeth this morning!” he said. “Sorry bud!”

The human turned swiftly and went into the cleansing room, which soon emitted the sounds of rushing water. The human came out still grinning.

“All clean!” He declared. “Won’t happen again!”

“Thank you,” Quilx’tch said, feeling distinctly uneasy now. “However that was not my question.”

“Thecolor?” Human Friend Scotty asked in surprise. “That was just my blood.”

The human stared at him with expectancy as he waited the polite six seconds to reply. Quilx’tch felt himself “puffing up” as the humans called it and Human Friend Scotty’s expression rapidly morphed form expectant to concerned.

“Why,” Quilx’tch asked carefully, “were you bleeding into the catch basin this morning as you cleaned your teeth.”

Human Friend Scotty’s face lit up with in the way that Quilx’tch was beginning to understand meant the human had an easy answer to a question.

“You remember I accidentally broke my sonic cleaner?” he asked.

Quilx’tch replied in the affirmative. Watching the human first fumble and drop the item on the floor. Then kick it into the far wall, only to finally step on it, damaging both the device and his foot in the process had been very educational on the value of the spider walks the humans insisted on installing in jointly occupied bases.

“And I told you that I would be switching to the old fashioned method of teeth cleaning?” Human Friend Scotty went on.

“Mechanical friction and chemical layering with a brush applicator,” Quilx’tch replied, bobbing his head in a yes gesture.

“Well, you always bleed a little when you switch back,” Human Friend Scotty said with a dismissive wave of his hand. “Sorry I forgot to warn you about it, and sorry I forgot to clean my blood out of the sink after.”

Human Friend Scotty seemed to consider this revelation the end of the conversation and without waiting so much as a second for a response turned and left the room, presumably in search of coffee. Quilx’tch paused, waiting for him to come back and explain...something...anything more about the situation. But the door of their room stayed stubbornly closed.

Quilx’tch took a deep breath and ran his paws over his primary eyes.

“Right,” he said to the empty air. “First I will speak to the base medic. Then breakfast.”

He only admits to the full truth after I confront him repeatedly. He recently promised to be fully honest after I discovered their relationship was too close, but I caught him hiding interactions again. He says he hides things out of fear of losing me, but I’m at my breaking point. I love him and want to trust him, but I can’t shake the feeling there’s always more he’s not telling me. How do I move forward and believe him?

My husband and I have been together for 9 years (7 of those married). For the most part, he’s an amazing partner and dad, but there have been repeated issues with dishonesty throughout our relationship, first around hiding porn, and now an emotional affair with a younger female coworker.

The biggest problem for me isn’t necessarily what he does but that every single time, it takes days or weeks to pull the full truth out of him. He’s a terrible liar (I can tell when he’s lying), but he’s somehow great at hiding things and denying them until I corner him. For me, honesty is non-negotiable because of past trauma, but every time I find out something, it’s like peeling layers off an onion—there’s always more underneath.

The latest issue involves this younger coworker, “C”. They’ve gotten closer than what’s normal for other coworkers. I’ve found out bit by bit that he’s deleted messages, brought her coffee, shared personal details about our life, and been more willing to help her than anyone else in his office. He claims nothing physical has happened, and I really want to believe that, but it’s so hard when there’s always something he didn’t tell me until I pry it out.

We had a huge confrontation where he swore he would be fully honest and even had a conversation with her to set boundaries. Things were good for a few weeks, and I tried to trust him. But just last week, I found out they were alone together again—something he didn’t tell me despite promising he would.

He says he’s scared of losing me, which is why he hides things, but I feel like this is a never-ending cycle. I love him, he’s my best friend, and we were even going through fertility treatments for a second child, but this is breaking me. I’ve asked him for full transparency, but I feel like there’s always more he’s not telling me. He’s signed up for therapy and is trying, but I don’t know how to move on if I can’t trust him.

How do I know if he’s really being honest now? How do I rebuild trust when he has such a pattern of hiding things until he’s forced to admit them? I don’t want to constantly question him, but I’m exhausted and don’t know if I can do this anymore. Any advice on how to move forward and believe him would be greatly appreciated.
